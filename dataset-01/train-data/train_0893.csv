2,Disappointing,"I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it. Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release."
3,GOOD BEGINNING BUT POOR ENDING.......,"I have read many of her books, and this one was no exception when I first started--it held my attention with every page until the trip to Alaska-(-very far fetched--sleeping with an eskimo you just met and taking off all your clothes to keep warm-when you are supposedly in a very fragile state after being raped--highly unlikely!!)overall, I would just say it was a very sad book with no real admirable characters.....not as good as ""MY SISTERS KEEPER"".but nonetheless, fairly accurate of todays teenage lifestyles."
2,Not as good as Ms. Picoult's other novels.,"I have read several of Jodi Picoult's novels and this is certainly not as good as some of her others. At first the story line was interesting and held my attention however the last 1/3 of the book was predictable and drawn out. I will say however, that the inclusion and description of native Alaskan culture is interesting."
2,a struggle to finish,"I was not impressed with this book. I just didn't believe in the characters, wasn't invested in the characters... I would not recommend it to a friend. I only have so much time to read, this was a waste of time."
1,Save Your Money,"I was so excited at having another Jodi Picoult book to read but, Boy! was I disappointed. It's hard to believe that the same person who wrote such wonderful other books wrote The Tenth Circle. Disjointed, strange, confusing."
3,A decent read,This book was a good read that kept me entertained. Not as good as the other Jodi Picoult books I have read.
2,Bizaar!,"I'm a huge Jodi Picoult fan, believe she is a genious writer with a knack for captivating a reader from page one to the end. However, this book was simply too bizaar for me. I found the comic page interruptions to be distracting, actually taking away from the story rather than enhancing it. This was the only book by this magnificent author that I felt compelled to toss before finishing."
2,Not great...,"I enjoyed this only because Picoult wrote it and I like her writing style. Other than that, it's just a book...another story. I didn't find her normal ""shock"" like her other books...and I really waited for it! She has wrote other wonderful books, I suppose they all can't be ""amazing."" But if your new to Picoult, she offers many other great page turners...just not this one."
2,Eh.....,"I read the back of this book and thought, ""sounds interesting"" but eh...It was good in parts a bit overdramatic and other parts just lagged. I finished reading it in time for the movie on Lifetime and I was even more disappointed. The book is better than the movie but still... eh."
4,Good read,I liked this book. The only thing that was hard for me to follow was the comic book part of it. That is why I only give it 4 stars instead of 5
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I absolutely love Jodi Picoult and her books, but this one stumped me. I quit reading after about the first 100 pages, when I realized that I was resisting the urge to throw the book at something.I know others have read it and loved it, and I totally respect their opinion!! For me, though, this wasn't a winner -- or a keeper."
3,Interesting idea...,"but the book was kind of a let down. It is the story of 14 year old Trixie, who accuses her boyfriend of rape. We also see her parents battle for their marriage as they fight to save their daughter from self destruction. Very interesting idea and take on Dante's nine circles but the end was a huge let down...The comic book element of this book is totally cool... with the hidden letters and subsequent message! Almost worth checking this book out for alone....maybe."
4,Disturbing and Riveting,"Do you know what your teenager is doing? When a 14-year-old girl is date raped, her father cannot suppress his rage, which is born of a violent past. Soon, their family is thrust into a downward spiral that can only end in disaster.A master of interpersonal drama, Picoult writes with startling insight about secrets, emotions and desires. Oddly punctuated with pages from the father's comic books, as well as a strange detour up north to Alaska, this novel is nevertheless reminiscent of Picoult's best works, with compelling imagery throughout. Disturbing yet riveting, and marked by Picoult's as-always brilliant prose."
2,Enjoyed the writing style but weak story....,I enjoyed the style of writing but was disappointed with the weak story. It was very predictable and needed some substance...
1,"Words, lots of words","I tried hard to get into this book for my Book Club. The meeting is tomorrow, and I still haven't been able to read the book. I struggled and forced my way through reading the first 30 pages. Then I speed-read some more pages. Then I browsed some more pages. Even after I read the last few pages, I still don't know what this story is really about. When the story isn't confusing and disjointed, it's dark and depressing. It seems like a young adult novel for very dramatic, angsty teenage girls."
2,Misses the Target,"I hated this book. I love most of Picoult's other novels, especially The Pact and Harvesting the Heart.This book had many possibilities, but none panned out. If the plot had stayed in Alaska, that would have been preferable.The comic book stuff really annoyed me. I first started this book in June, ran into the comic pages and gave up. Then I read it all during the last week, and though I did finish it, I just did not believe in the mom, Laura, or in Zephyr--even her name made me think ""contrived.""This author is capable of fine work. Tenth Circle seems as if it was simply a way to show off some knowledge about Dante and the Inuit culture."
2,Not a page turner,I think this novel is best for younger readers. I found it a little cheesy. I stopped reading it after 60 pages because the comic strips got annoying and it could not hold my attention.
4,I enjoyed this as an adult but good for young adults,There are a lot of sensitive subjects in this book. I found interesting and too true how the victim of the rape become the enemy and bad guy when the accused is a popular hockey star. I enjoyed the characters and will definitely look to read more Jodi Picoult books.
5,Second Glance by Jodi Picoult,I am now on a mission to read all of Jodi's books. They touch you and your not the same.
4,I'm glad I'm not 13 anymore!,"This is my second Picoult book that I have read. The first was ""My Sister's Keeper"", I loved her writing style so much I had to buy another. I decided to read ""The Tenth Circle"". I really liked this book, it only took me a day and a half to finish. Although I can't relate to anyone in the story, I learned more than I bargained for. I couldn't believe that teenagers these days are really doing the things she wrote about. This was the first time I was exposed to settings in Alaska and I was thrilled to learn so much in a short amount of time. I wished the ending went further instead of stopping while both mother and daughter were in jail. Overall I really enjoyed escaping into Alaska, I can't wait to read another book by Jodi Picoult."
1,Read Dante Instead,"Reading this book was the tenth circle of hell. And I'm a fan of Jodi Picoult! The characters were unsympathetic, especially Trixie (the aptly named 14 year old). The plot was unbelievable and the inclusion of comic book illustrations was a distraction. Finally, the ending was the worst ever and Picoult is not exactly known for her happily-ever-afters."
3,Great start,"I never read anything by Jodi Picoult before, but I was intrigued and I bought this one. It starts out beautifully with an engrossing story, terrifically realistic characters and some wonderful writing. But by the middle of the book, the author seems to have run out of steam. Once we reach the second half of the book - without giving anything away - the story unravels and one of the characters becomes so unlikable, without any real explanation for her actions, that I hate to say I lost interest. I know this writer is very gifted, but this book didn't do it for me."
3,I agree with the other reviewers,"If you're wondering what to believe...this book may or may not be for you. The book does have a lot of symbolism (especially the first 100 or so pages) and a lot of drama (to the point where you knew it was just a story-I never got past the feeling that the characters were fake, as I have in other books). I usually like her writing style, and I devoured My Sister's Keeper. The comic book chapters, which I was excited about (I've seen this type of text/comic book done very well), was very disappointing. As well, it seemed like the story dropped off after page 150."
3,Not bad but not good,"Read this book in about four days. I became a big fan of Picoults after My sisters keeper. I thought this book had a great storyline but too many outside influences, such as running off to Alaska and having to grasp all of the Alaskan language and then ofcourse going back and fourth with Dante's Inferno. I felt like it would of done the book some good to go into the Seth/Laura storyline alittle more. I would not recommend this book to someone who is hesistent on reading it in the first place."
3,Typical,"If I had never read one of Jodi Picoult's book, I would have given this 5 stars and raved about what a great book this is. Unfortunately, I've read all her books, and I know that the last few have followed the same pattern. I knew the ending long before I wanted to, and it made finishing it a bore."
2,Not a hit,"It's always a toss up when I buy a Jodi Picoult novel. I know from the onset that her books will either hit or miss. It's the chance I take. This one was a miss. It was predictable and oh so many themes. Parts were just not believable. And the comics? What an annoying distraction. When she writes another will I buy it? Sure, why not. She's had her hits as well."
3,"Good start, bad end",I picked up this book because I enjoyed My Sister's Keeper so much. This book started off as a page turner but it slowly unraveled. The end was ridiculous and very disappointing. A fourteen year old ending up in the middle of a dog sled race in Alaska?? Come on. Stupid. Skip this one and try another of Picoult's books.
4,"The Tenth Circle, by Jodi Picoult","I really enjoyed reading this book. I am an omnivorous reader and plow through 3 - 7 books every week. ""The Tenth Circle"" was a beautifully written story and Picoult makes it possible for a reader to understand the emotions and thoughts of persons who have suffered a tragedy that the reader has not. She shows how a harm to a child affects the life, not only of that child, but of his parents and close relatives. What I prize above all in a writer is the ability to tell a story and teach me something I didn't know before. Picoult accomplished this in spades in ""The Tenth Circle""."
1,lackluster,this is definitely not one of Picoult's best efforts. The story drags and seems very contrived.
1,I did not like this book,"Unfortunately, The Tenth Circle was the first Jodi Picoult book I read. For that reason I put off reading any others for a long while. Recently, at the urgings of my daughter-in-law and mother, I read another one of her books, Salem Falls, and LOVED it. Since then, I have read Mercy, Picture Perfect, 19 Minutes and several others - all of them are GREAT.I would not recommend The Tenth Circle, but I would definitely recommend all the others I've read."
2,Not her best work,"This book was a little too weird and over the top for me. There was some good issues in the book but it didn't pull together. It was just strange. However, she writes some wonderful books. Don't let this one be your first read by this author or you may not go back for more."
3,reminded me of her other books,"I liked the idea of the puzzle, yet I still haven't figured it out yet. I'm still missing a few letters. The book overall was good, just seemed familiar."
3,it was OK but not her best,"The book lacked something.. can't explain it. It was incomplete too. What was cool about this book are the comic illustrations. I had no idea there was a hidden message within the pictures, until at the end of the book Jodi says there is. You have look for all the letters to come out with a quote and the author. I had to go back once more and then I got it. I recommend Jodi's My Sister's Keepr"
3,A bit of a let down,"One of the things that I love about Jodi Picoult's books is how you get sucked in by her characters and how there usually something that takes you by such a surprise as the story comes together in the last few chapters. I am usually reading the last chapter of her books in awe at how she was able to pull all the pieces together without me ever seeing that THIS was how the book would end.In The Tenth Circle, Picoult again sucks you in with the depth of her characters and how you can really picture the depth of emotion involved. However, the last few chapters felt ""rushed"", as if the author felt like she had to quickly explain all that had happened so far. And unfortunately, the 'surprise' that normally occurs at the end of Picoult's novels was transparent from the middle of the story.Although this won't turn me away from reading more of Picoult's novels, I was a bit disenchanted by this one."
4,She does it again!,"Leave it Jodi Picoult to reinvent the format for literary fiction with her newest work, THE TENTH CIRCLE. This is the story of one family being torn apart by a tragic circumstance and how they must redefine their roles in order to stay together. Daniel Stone, a comic book artist, must come to terms with the rape of his young daughter Trixie at the hands of one of her classmates. Prone to rage and anger, Daniel retells his story in the form of a comic book that is interspersed throughout the novel. The readers are actually given specific depictions through his art of how he views the traumatic events of his life. Picoult writes with gorgeous imagery and unparalleled beauty and at the same time is able to hook her readers from page one. She definitely does not disappoint in her latest work."
3,"Not bad, but didn't like the ending.",I enjoyed the first 3/4's of this book but found the ending to be disappointing. I found it difficult to read the comics on the Kindle.
3,It's the first book I read by her. I guess it's not a good start?,"It was a mediocre experience reading this book. I enjoyed the arctic scenery described in the book and the sled dogs. I feel like there are some plots missing after reading this book. It was rush-finished to me. But in general, writing was fluent, not much of a story to me though. sorry."
2,My least favorite of her books...,"This book disappointed me so much the first time that I read it. Since I felt similarly about some of Picoult's other books (Mercy,Salem FallsandVanishing Acts: A Novel), I decided to give it another try. Unfortunately, I still did not enjoy it. Often, Picoult writes with a hint of magic, but this book is just bleak and the characters are much less sympathetic than in her other books. It also leaves the ending rather unfinished. The ""twist"" to the plot is just... lame and while it doesn't follow her courtroom formula, the book still has a formulaic feel.The comic book sections were entertaining enough, but the game with the hidden letters was more distracting than enriching. Inspired by Dante, this just isn't an example of Picoult's best work, and is probably my least favorite of her books."
2,Too miserable. I Ditched it.,"Like a lot of the others here, I normally love Jodi Picoult's books. She's a great writer and while I think she did an excellent job ""painting the picture in my mind"" in The Tenth Circle, the content was disturbing. I rarely ditch a book but aside from this disturbed teenager being an aggrivating character, her behavior at a party caused me to shut the book and instantly decide to stop reading it. It's just too much and NOT AT ALL what I was expecting from a Jodi Picoult book. I'll still read her books, but not this one."
2,The Tenth Circle,This was terrible. It's like someone saw one too many Oprah's about teen girls out of control. Very unsatisfying...
1,I was a Jodi Picoult fan until now.,This book was even worse than Perfect Match. In the past I loved Jodi Picoult's books but I will never waste money purchasing her books again. She has lost her touch. This went over the top with the ugly drawings . Gooodbye Jodi.
1,Yuck Yuck Yuck,"She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the ""ABC's"" of how to end a novel?This was just lame. You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again!"
2,The Tenth Circle,The book came in good time but the pages were all bent. I got the book for a friend so that made me unhappy.
1,"A waste of money, not to say the time...",I've never read Picoult before and after this one I don't think I want to buy another book by him. He seems to have some good ideas but he doesn't know how to execute them.
2,"ambitious, scrambled","I have admired Jodi Picoult's skill in the past, but The Tenth Circle spreads all over the place, ending up in Alaska. I learned a few things about current-day teenagers, though. They are so precocious and adult in their party games I wonder if the teenagers I know are like that. I plowed through to the final page, but very likely will not venture into another book of hers for a while."
1,not worth reading,"I found this book boring and terrible, the plot was bizzare and totally unrealistic even for the heartiest fiction readers."
2,My least favorite so far,"Bringing Dante's work into the story was interesting, but the comic book sections were distracting, juvenile and down right annoying. The plot was ok, but I never felt like I knew the characters and, therefore, couldn't really sympathize or empathize with any of them. I also found a lot of the links from one character to another distant and unrealistic. Definitely not my favorite."
3,Not her best,"I am an avid Picoult fan. I have purchased every book she's written, and I eagerly awaited this one. I found the comic book inserts distracting and difficult to follow. The narrative was as strong as ever-her descriptions are vivid and moving. Picoult chooses serious and important contemporary themes to explore;unfortunately, I feel as though this book just grazed the surface of the issues surrounding rape."
4,A positive standpoint,"Though many reviews here call The Tenth Circle convuluted and over-the-top, I thought it was a very good book. I agree that some events in the book were a little sketchy, but her characters were very real and believable. I sympathized with Trixie, a teenager myself, and I disagree that her emotional scars were soap opera-like. Her attempted suicide hit home with me and I felt for her and her parents. Many teens commit suicide for less. I did, however, enjoy My Sister's Keeper more than Circle, but I am looking forward to reading more of Picoult's books."
3,A Disappointment,"After 'My Sister's Keeper', taut and unpredictable, I was waiting for this new offering with the anticipation of a compelling read, but I was disappointed. The attempt to give depth to the narrative via Dante is unnecessary - as are the comic strips, which are silly too. Remove them and there's still a fair story, but not of the interest I expect from Picoult, with characters which border on the one-dimensional. I am sorry but this one is certainly not worthy of her."
1,What a disappointment!,"As always, I had been looking forward to Jodi Picoult's new book. I have read almost all of Picoult's books and have enjoyed most of them. She certainly missed the mark on this one! I felt she tried to insert too many themes (ie. date rape,infidelity,drugs,cultural themes to name a few)into the story. Too many themes and what's with the comics throughout the book.......Seems to me that Ms. Picoult is loosing her touch and is now becoming very commercialized in her writing and forsaking quality and good story lines for something as ridiculous as this book is! I will think twice before running out to buy her books and this Tenth Circle book I am too embarrassed to even give it to a friend to read! Shame on you Jodi for writing such a bad story line!"
2,Ehh..Not my cup of tea.,"Well, since this is a more recent book from Jodi Picoult, I pressed purchase before I ever read the storyline. I thought it would be interesting because the subject is a teen, and I'm a teen so I thought that I would be able to relate to the book.I started reading it and found it a bit boring, but as the story went on, it got more interesting. Then, the story started to drag; I felt like the fact that the mom having an affair with her student was too far fetched. I also found all the comics annoying as I'm trying to read a book about a teen and her struggle with being raped, not reading an action comic book. So, I just skipped over those parts of the book.I found the ending to be a big let down, but at least we know what happened in the end.I wouldn't read it again, but I might consider suggesting it to one of my teen friends."
2,"Not Very Good, 2.5 Stars","I didn't care for this book. The story dragged a bit. The dad, while loving, was on the weenie side. The whole Eskimo portion of the story was boring. It was equally unbelievable that the girl runs away to Alaska and shows up at a dog race.I thought the comic book pictures were pointless. I did not choosed this book to read a comic strip.Overall, the book was a disappointment."
1,Works better than a sleeping pill.,"I have read everything that Jodi Picoult has written and have loved many of them and felt sorry that a tree was killed to print others. This book falls into the latter category. First I do have trouble relating to characters with names like Trixie, Dutch and Zephyr. But more importantly the story seesaws back and forth so rapidly not only between characters but between the present and the past that is hard to know who you are reading about and if it their present or their past! And finally you simply begin to not care. And the comic book insets did nothing to enhance the story line as far as I can see.Hard to believe this book was written by the same person as Second Glance and Salems Falls. Save your money."
3,not a riveting read,"I recently discovered Jodi Picoult and have read several of her books and always found them to be books that I just can't put down - and that doesn't happen often enough to me. I found The Tenth Circle to lack that ""Wow - didn't see that coming"" factor that many of her other works have and although it was entertaining and I finished it - it isn't her best."
2,The Tenth Circle Tries to Do Too Much and Does It Predictably,"I am an avid reader of Picoult's books, but this one was a disappointment. The plot tries to cover too many diverse topics (young love, rape, self-mutilation, suicide, murder, adultery, graphic novels, and Dante's Inferno just to name a few!) Much of what happens is either totally predictable or totally implausible; not a good combination for contemporary fiction."
5,Wake Up World,"The Western world must read this gritty, ground level, first person account by an extraordinary Muslim woman; survivor of revolution, war, abduction and the the everyday horrors of life in a near-medevial, oppressive Islamic theocracy. Ms Omid, politically precocious since childhood, cuts to the chase about the origin of terrorism and how to combat it."
5,Iranian Phenomenon Liberates Readers,"Ghazal Omid's Living In Hell represents autobiographical writing at its finest. In fact, it is the most captivating autobiography released in 2005. As a book enthusiast and editor for many years, I am ashamed of my past subscription to Publisher's Weekly, whose ""reviewer"" sliced Omid's astounding memoirs to pieces out of sexism and stupidity. In fact, it's evident that said reviewer only skimmed excerpts, as there is no way you could read this book without being completely inspired."
2,Thanks for nothing,"Prima, normally a trustworthy company when it comes to strategy guides, really failed to get the job done with its guide for Brigandine on the Playstation.Prima's guide basically tells readers about each country's starting knights and monsters, something any player could discover himself simply by selection each castle at the beginning of the game and writing down what he sees. The strategy fails to mention any of the characters who join the armies through quests or parts of the story. I got the feeling that the writer of this guide never played Brigandine; it seems, instead, that he just asked a friend for a basic description of the game and printed that information along with some pictures in order to sell a useless strategy guide.Any player who really wants hints about Brigandine should search online for an FAQ or walkthrough."
3,It was good as far as it went.,"I enjoy playing Brigandine, but am frustrated by the infrequent and oblique references to what may be an interesting storyline. I purchased the strategy guide for the primary purpose of learning more about the storyline, and for the secondary purpose of learning more about the knight and monster concepts and stats. In the first case, I was disappointed because the guide told me nothing about the storyline. In the second case, I learned less about the knights and monsters than what is already apparent in the game.Since I did not buy the guide for the the strategy, per se, I do not find fault with the insight to the strategy. In fact, I think the guide did a very good job of explaining strategy basics. Unfortunately, none of it was anything that would not be obvious after an hour of play.All in all, it was OK, but I was left with the feeling ""Is this it?"""
2,jazz shoes,"uncomfortably tight. even after several wears and has stretched with regular, normal use . i suggest buing a size up from the/your normal street size."
5,Excellent book written by a Wise woman!,"The first half of this interesting and insightful book explores the questions of who,what,why & how psychic talent is developed based on interviews with 43 reputable intuitives and healers. The second half has practical, down-to-earth meditations for developing your intuition. She even explains sophisticated & complex theories such as Bebtov's Pendulum and David Bohm's theory on universal energy so that a layman can understand! I've read hundreds of books on the subject and this is one of the best. She is a gifted teacher and I thank her for this book."
5,Great! She wears neither Birkenstock's nor white lab coat.,"Even if it weren't for the fact that my mother wrote ""Your Sixth Sense: Activating Your Psychic Potential"" I'd still think it's pretty great. Mom's book is the best, most sensible and believable explanation of human psychic ability that I have ever seen. She sees psychic ability as an extension of every human being's natural intuitive and creative abilities. And with that in mind she is able to go the next step and show readers in very practical steps how they can nurture and improve their own intuitive or ""psi"" abilities.With 30 years of experience as a psychotherapist and a pioneer in the field of guided imagery, Mom definitely knows what she's talking about. I vouch for her: She is neither a crunchy, spaced-out, fruit loop nor a cold laboratory clinician. She's a good writer and this is a good book."
2,Not for me,"I have been studying/reading books on the ""spiritual side"" for 25 years and this book was not for me. It seemed to me to be more of a story about the author overcoming challenging obstacles (which I applaud her for)and how she used her intuition to do it. The exercises are too much for me. It may be good for a beginner trying to ""tap in"" but I think I'm more advanced intuitively than this book and was looking for something different. I read about 3/4 of the way and did not finish reading it."
3,I recommend Your Sixth Sense,"This is an excellent road map if you are on the spiritual journey of finding your intuition. She gives great clues that let you know if you are succeeding. These are helpful because it lets you know that you are not sick, or loosing your mind.I found that making tapes of the scripts, they all ran longer than the time she said, but they are great guidelines for comingup with your own scripts. For those of you who do consciousness calibrations on their books, this for me shows a 350."
4,"Fascinating, as far as her editors let her go","I found this book enjoyable but frustrating. The author had fascinating experiences of her own and they were supplemented with an equally fascinating survey of how other psychics work. What frustrated me was all the explanation in the first part of the book. Surely it's preaching to the choir to do all the explaining about psychic ability. I doubt that the true audience for the book needs any of that.Instead, I'd have preferred an expanded section on techniques, which didn't go into as much depth as I'd have liked, and lengthier descriptions from the gifted folks the author interviewed. And I'm sure the author could have delivered this if the publisher hadn't demanded all the emphasis on explanation instead.The author has a wonderful, unique voice. I really enjoyed meeting her through this book."
3,I was disappointed with this book.,"I was half-way through before hitting any usable information. The content of the first 112 pages was repetitious and wordy, like the author needed to fill pages. This was a small book, but put concisely, it would have been a lot smaller. The profiles of the known psychics was the most interesting part, and the 39 pages of imagery exercises was the redeeming feature."
5,Mens Seiko Watches,"I ordered (2) Seiko #SNA410 Cronograph Watches for graduation gifts for two Grandsons. Watches arrived quickly, packed well, and in perfect condition. The two 8th grade graduates were delighted."
4,Seiko SNA410,"Solid construction, hefty in weight, great styling. Very pleased so far with this watch. I have owned Seiko watches for 30 years and have always had good results and service from them and will continue to buy them. Only complaint about this watch is the alarm, which is difficult to set and the alarm ""hands"" can get out of step with the actual watch time. Also, the alarm sound level is low and I would not depend on it for a wake up alarm. However, as I don't use the alarm, this is not a problem for me."
4,Great watch,I think the watch is fantastic - especially at the price! Very comfortable on my arm and easy to read. Very happy with my purchase
3,"not great, just okay",This isn't the worst Migraine fix but it's not the best. It does work but it took 3 of the doses included to finally get it under control. I've tried many many OTC and homeopathic migraine remedies and this one isn't the worst but it's far from the best
4,Really does take the edge off.,"Doesn't cure migranes, but helps you cope.I get the kind with auras.Luckily with changes in diet and who know what else, they've become very infrequent and mild.Been using for years and wish I would have had this when I was a kid when the hurt was really bad. Am 64 now.If you follow the directions, it will quell the nausea fairly quickly and reduce the pain after the aura clears.Always carry with me.Have had occasion to give to others who are sufferers with good results.Highly recommend."
2,The headache I never seen coming,"First, the wings are not very easy to attach-there is a lot of pulling and pushing to get them on. Once we managed to put them on they did not stay attached for play. These wings fell off so much we had to detached them so our son could play. This is a big disappointment for a 4-year old child, which is the recommended age. If buying for play beware but if buying as a collectors item, then this is a great gift."
3,Get the other x-jet,"My God! This is just a repainted version of the first x-jet movie toy that came out.Only this time, the color looks lousier (unlike the sleek dark blue of the original) and the claw thing under the fuselage was removed.To make up for it, Toy Biz included a 6-inch Wolverine, which doesn't really matter because you can just buy it separately.Do yourself a favor and find the original x-jet toy instead."
1,Save $ and your sanity!,"The joy of this toy last as long as it is in the box. After that, it's a nightmare. The wings constantly fall off, the jet engine sound does not have a shut off - and it is very loud, and is prone to start with the slightest provocation (like walking by the toy in the middle of the night when you go to check on your kid) and continue sounding off until it decides to stop! My little X-Man fanatic put this on the bottom of his toy box after a week."
5,Hilarious meditation,"I have read of a Buddhist master who had his students laugh for three minutes each morning. He compared that time of laughing to be equivalent to an hour of meditation. Being a woman with ""time"" issues, I try to get as much healing laughter meditation as possible into my day. This book packs a powerful punch in that respect.If you have ever owned a cat or known someone who owned a cat, you will laugh out loud at many of these short poems based on the Japanese form of Haiku. The universal truths of cats -- and people -- are both loving and hilariously honest. It would make a perfect gift to treat yourself, a friend, your pastor, your rabbi, your veterinarian -- anyone who could use a good belly laugh."
1,Clearly a minority view but ...,"This book has delightful pen and ink drawings of cats - realistic or as cats' would look if their faces were more expressive.The haiku, on the other hand, confuses external form for the ""essence"" of haiku ... it the syllables track it must be haiku. To fill the syllable requirements, the text employes all the cliches about cats. Since cats (at least the ones I live with) are masters of the present moment and understatement, haiku seems a natural form for poetry ""written"" by cats. Unfortunately, this book is not it.One entry did catch my attention, although I fear it has a misprint: ""Yes, actually, / I am burying a moose (sic)/ In the litter box!""If you love cats, try ""The Fur Person"" instead."
2,Weak Imitation,"If you are going to read cat haiku,you might want to try other books.Much of this is similar to othercat haiku books, but it's not originalin its idea. Personally, I wouldrecommend Catnips: A Book of Haikuon Cats. It was first with the idea."
1,Sorry but Not Haiku,"It's a funny idea, but really has nothing to do with Haiku poetry at all. And that, I'm afraid, is VERY disappointing. I recommend checking out ""Take A Deep Breath: The Haiku Way to Inner Peace"" to anyone who is really interested in understanding and truly enjoying Haiku poetry."
1,This book stinks!,"Let me make a simple observation, people by these type of books for the pictures. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words right? But flipping through this book gave me the impression that the authors wanted to explain in words rather than with pictures. It was ""blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"" when a few more photos would have been much better. Why describe with words???I liked ""Prefab Modern"" by Jill Herbers better because it has more designs. It actually had many of the same designers in Prefab but with more pictures, less words, and a floor plan which really helps you to conceptualize the designs. Not only that but the book by Jill Herbers is cheaper too..."
2,Not what I expected...,"This was a very nice book, but I have to admit that it was not quite what I had hoped for. I was looking for alot of information on Modern/Contemporary homes, more toward the 50's and 60's style, and from the look of the cover, I felt that was what was inside. Unfortunately, thats not the case at all, even the cover house was somewhat of a let-down inside. There is a little information on the square block metal homes of the 50's period, but most of the works are completely unliveable, done only for an original look (we are talking about 2 room homes shaped like cars)...if you are looking for an interesting conversation/coffee table book, this is nice, but not a necessity for the lover of modern homes!"
2,Overly general,"I was so excited when I read some of the reviews of this book, but once I got it, I realized that it is just not the comprehensive book I was looking for. There are tons of pictures, but they are not as good as those in other similar books. The book I do recommend on this topic is ""Prefab Modern"" by Jill Herbers. The pictures and discriptions are great. It's not a book you'd use to actually build your own home, but it has a variety of ideas and places to start."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!,"The performances are great and both THE MERRY WIDOW and THE DESERT SONG are given very theatrical recordings here.The problem is sound quality. These are bootleg Cds dubbed from poor quality 78 RPMS with no attempt to clean up the sound. It is muddy, scratchy, noisy and distant. Also several of the sides were transferred running off-speed!!Happily Decca Broadway has sued to have these bogus discs taken off the market and have announced plans to issue these same titles under their own label. Decca owns the original masters so the sound will be much better. Do yourself a favour and wait a few months for the Decca releases, and avoid at all costs this an any other releases from Encore/Box-Office!!"
1,Operettas,The recording quality of this CD is very poor. I was very disappointed in this recording and cannot give it a high rating.
2,"DOUBLE THE PRICE OF THAT OF THE REG. XBOX, RIDICULOUS ! ! !","Why is it that Microsoft (which controls the 360 game prices) thinks that we should pay double for this game on the 360 platform. At least if their going to do that throw in a Soccer ball and a Fifa faceplate for the 360. But as always Microsoft taking advantage of it's consumers. Id wait to buy this game if I were you, if you really want it. It should drop to $30-40 soon being a sports game. Id rather buy Battlefield 2 Modern Combat for the 360, now there's an incredible game !...and you can download the demo for free thru XBOX Live Marketplace. Hey, instead of wasting $60 for the Fifa game get XBOX LIVE for a whole year !"
3,Long wait,"It took almost 30 days to get this product, if I would have known it would have taken this long I would have just bought the 2010 version"
5,This CD rules,"All the songs my mom used to sing to me in the car, beautifully done. Our daughter loves it and I don't get sick of listening to it. She has a special dance (basically, jumping) she does for The Fox is on the Town-o.You can tell that the Nields also have children (Nerissa has a good blog - worth checking out)."
5,Great sockets,"Already put a few of these through some abuse. I was afraid because of the price that they wouldn't hold up well, but they do. I am an auto technician for a living and I have used these at least once every day since I've gotten them. Would buy again."
4,"Good book, poor quality construction","Really liked the content, good introduction to critical thinking for my kids. My biggest gripe is with the construction of the book, the pages started falling out after just a few days. The glue that holds them to the spine is very bad, I ended up having to glue it back together myself"
2,"Some good, some bad","The frist part of the book is nice, for the most part, and the last is nice, for the most part. Sometimes I think the language and word choice isn't very kid friendly, but for the most part it's fine.The middle though I really don't like. There is a section where the author tells children what skeptics do and don't believe. The irony of that is startling, and off-putting. To be honest, a lot of the book reads like indoctrination. I happen to agree with the message, but the way it is communicated isn't much better than some religious texts.I don't think I can actually read this book to my child, I think I'm going to cut the pages out and re-bind them, or maybe even just copy the cartoons and write my own text that has the message without the preaching tone."
3,price point outrageous for print quality,"I gave this book a 3 star because while a worthy topic for my kid's library - the pricepoint for the quality, brevity and poor illustrations in this book and in maybe right, maybe wrong is absolutely outrageous. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the print and illustrations and the skinny book for the price I had paid."
5,Kids need to be encouraged to develop critical thinking skills,"This is an excellent book that encourages children to ask questions and to be skeptical.Popular culture and most schools do a terrible disservice to children by discouraging freethought and original thinking. Too many children are led to believe that authority figures are always right about everything.This easy-to-read and well illustrated book (80 pages) is just right for ages 6-12.I suggest that those who care about children consider buying a few copies and dontating them to local schools.I also recommend:How Do You Know It's True?: Discovering the Difference Between Science and SuperstitionThe Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions--Guy P. Harrison, author ofRace and Reality: What Everyone Should Know About Our Biological Diversityand50 Reasons People Give for Believing in a God"
5,All kids should read this (and some adults too)!,"I read this to my 10 year old daughter and we both loved it! It raises questions everyone should think about and it's easy for kids to understand, plus the illustrations added to her interest. I wish I'd have had this book sooner! Great boook for teaching kids to think for themselves and use logic instead of blind faith."
3,Failed at my house....,"Tried to get my 2 sons, 13 & 14,to raise some questions as a result of reading it. They read it on a car trip to Florida. Had little success with them even though the one is the ultimate skeptic. I think I would have better luck introducing the book to them at a younger age of 9 or 10. When they were not as skeptical about the old man."
2,Content OK. Very poor quality binding.,This book totally fell apart as soon as I opened it.The glue that holds the pages in is crap - all brittle and crumbly - and the pages all fell out - every one.
4,A good tool for parenting beyond belief.,"This book serves as another tool in the toolbox for parents challenged with raising their children in a world heavily influenced by religion. It provides a thought process for talking to children and a methodology for developing similar subjects in teaching children to think for themselves and make decisions based on evidence and reason rather than accepting the dogma of tradition and authority. ""Maybe Right, Maybe Wrong"" is a similar book that demonstrates a similar line of thought."
2,Good Hype...Poor Racing...,This game is mostly hype. I was hoping for GT3 with cell shading but that's not what this game is. The graphics are different but there are a lot of jaggies and pixelization. Most of the cars upgrades are avaliable for free so why work hard to get your car in shape? The controls are too sensative. Turn alittle to much and the car spins out coming to a complete stop. I can't count the number of races I was leading but spun out and ended up 6th. I also found the special effects from the tires and of the line when driving fast to be very annoying.
2,Eh.,"Its so hard to handle your car that you lose every race. The graphics may be great, but the way they made this game is poor. I would maybe rent it but dont buy it because I took it to a used game shop to sell after I played it once. Dont get this."
2,NOT a cartoon gran turismo 3.,"-Auto Modellista is not what I thought it would be. Whenever I asked anyone about it they said ""oh! yea that, its like a cartoon gran turismo 3"". it's not.-It's a very short game with awful physics and the most number of laps in a race is like 4 around a short track. I beat this game in 3 days. only playing for 45-75 minutes a day.-Most of your time though is spent customising your cars which is awsome because of the good variety of cars and the variety of parts. The customazation of cars is the best part of the game. That is why I gave it 2 stars.-The online mode is fun if you can find someone to play whith but the online racing isn't as fun as midnight club II (niether is the game)-The multi player is fun if you can find someone at your skill level.---thats all now go buy Gran Turismo 3 or Mightnight club II---"
1,Auto LodaSh**sa,"Sorry, don't buy this game! The idea of a cell shaded racre is cool, all the hype, the pictures and the new challenger to Gran tourismo are completely false. You have zero control of your car around corners, braking sends your car into some crazy wobble across the track until you slow down enough to go straight (with added SFX of something reminisent of opening the door to your home on a very windy day and not closing it right!)I was stupid - i bought it full price when it came out and hated it the second i got going. Music sucks, tracks suck, sound sucks - cars look cool but overall - IT SUCKS!Don't waste $1 let alone $50 on this heap of steaming stuff!!!"
2,Not The Greatest Racing Game :(,"Ya, this game is not the greatest racing game I've played...I mean, even Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero is better than this. The only thing I like about this game is there is a lot of cars to choose from, it doesn't cost to get parts, and you can decorate your garage. Decorating your garage is the coolest thing. You can put any kind of posters you win up, and you can put all the other things you win. To me, thats probably the best part of the game. The racing looks so kiddyish, and the turning is kind of wierd. I havent played online yet so maybe that might be better than the single-player. Im gonna go play Counter-Strike...Im out!"
3,average page turner.,"Without giving away the story, all I can say is that it started out with an interesting premise and then went astray somewhere in the middle. The book in it's simplistic form is about a lonely woman falling in love with a recovering pyschopath. This is a very good idea and was presented in a very creative way in the book but the author took the creativity too far.I'm a huge vampire novel fan but the whole vampire link in this story really was useless and just made a simple premise into a complicated one."
3,A Bit Disjointed,"This very informative history of Orthodoxy is definitely not for novices to church history. Though some early debates are explained, references to many events and disputes that intersected with western religious history are made without further explanation. Prior knowledge of western church history or perhaps even eastern orthodoxy is necessary, therefore, to decode this book. Also, it jumps around in places, repeating information that has already been provided and bouncing back and forth between periods hundreds of years apart.A good book, but I believe there must be better histories of the Orthodox Church out there."
4,Cosmo Beauty Finally Crowned,"Despite the editorial review and the two customer reviews, The Last Dance is NOT the 8th DVD of Battle Athletes: Victory. I was shocked to read some of the spoilers. As you can see, the product description is about the NEXT TO LAST volume.Anyway, this DVD is rather anti-climactic. I think we all know who the Cosmo Beauty will be. And the fact that she runs it with her best friend in a kind of love fest, rather than competition, makes it lack the suberb athletic competition and tension we have seen in the series.However, the last few seconds of the DVD are completely unexpected - and a literal - cliffhanger. I can't wait to see the 8th volume - even though I read spoilers! Grr!"
4,this probably won't be too helpful.,"The three episodes contained on this volume are the only ones of this particular series I have seen, but they were quite interesting. The Japanese version was nice and the dubbed version was above average. There wasn't much in the way of extra DVD stuff to look at other than previews for other series, but the three episodes themselves were plenty good for the moola spent. As for the show itself, the characters were somewhat intriguing, and the plot was appropriately silly while at the same time having a good deal of the sort of character interaction that results in a bit of drama and I myself was looking forward to the future developments, which I cannot comment upon at present due to the fact that I have not seen the following three final episodes. I would imagine that the rest of the series is worth a look and if you already do like the series then this volume is probably one of the best due to the intense rivalries that pop up in these very episodes."
5,Great collection for DBZ fans,I loved this box set lots of cool extras. only trouble is they end in the middle of the android saga of season 4!
1,INCLUDE THE SUPERIOR ENGLISH SCORE OR NO PEACE,"I thought after numerous fans complaining about the absence of the US musical score, Funimation would include it in their second Dragonbox, but they didn't. Now we're on the 3rd and still nothing. Shame on you Funimation for being so greedy! You know full well you won't include it because sales will go down on the orange box sets if you do. You want to keep marketing it as something different from the orange sets so people will keep buying both. Greed will ultimately be the downfall of your company.... Not to say that it can go that further down. None of your titles really sell except Dragonball stuff. haha"
1,Complete POS,"My daughter didn't like swinging so the swing got very little use. Even so, the motor stopped working after after 9 months. It would just make a clunking sound. Even when it did work, the buttons were flaky. I would have to push the buttons just right, too hard or too long and the swing would turn on and back off again. When it was running it made excessive noise.For $40 Greco sold me another motor section, but by the time it arrived, my daughter had outgrown the swing so I never used it! I put the swing in storage. Now I have another baby so I got the swing out and found it doesn't work. The motor makes the same clunking noise as the old broken one."
1,motor broke after 2 months,My baby enjoyed this while it lasted... but the quality is substandard.Save your money and look for a different brand.Very disappointing.
1,broken twice right out of package,"I purchased this item, the motor stops working after 5 minutes. Sent it back and got new one. Same problem. I would recommend this item if you want to own a swing that does not work that you can push for hours by hand."
1,Defective,"There appears to be something defective about the motors of these swings, because ours also stopped working. Initially it worked intermittently, or would stop after being on only a few minutes, but now it's stopped entirely. I am really disappointed and do not recommend it."
4,Who needs a rocking chair?!,"We purchased this item to see if it would help calm our fussy newborn baby, and it has helped a lot. It runs on 3 'D' batteries. I thought it came with an AC adapter so we could plug it in, but it does not. Our little guy will only fall asleep if we put the speed on setting '5'; anything lower and he cries. The table tray gets in the way and can't be removed. Since you have to put it together yourself, I recommend not attaching the tray until you want to start using it. Very easy to put together. Mobile bears should be more colorful."
4,Very satisfied,"I bought this swing for my new grandson who is now 3 months old. Being ""out of the loop"" so to speak for so many years as far as baby products go, I did a little research and decided on the Graco Lovin Hug swing and I'm very glad I did. It is well constructed, easy to get him in and out of, and very comfortable for my little guy, who really seems to enjoy it when he comes to visit. And of course, at Amazon.com, I found the best price which made Grandmom very happy! The only thing I wondered about was why the mobile animals weren't more colorful instead of boring white!"
1,"Bought this swing, returned it.","I bought this swing to replace a second hand fisher price swing that my son had outgrown. We got it home and put it together. Not only did he just not like sitting in it, the swinging motion was jerky at best. I was sure I had it together wrong because the range of the swinging action was so limited, but I checked and rechecked and it wasn't a mistake. Overall, the swing just felt cheap and wobbly. I took the swing back and borrowed another fisher price swing from a friend (the rainforest one) and it is great. Smooth swinging, sturdy, well made, and even plugs into the wall which is a nice feature. When buying baby products in the future I will probably lean towards looking at fisher price first."
2,"Bought in mid-Oct, broken by mid-Jan...","Nice swing for comfort and baby likes it, but it's broken after 3 months of use. Just stopped working. Should have listened to the other reviews and purchased something else..."
1,Motor loud. music has a screething noise - so useless,"Purchased this for grandchild. Swing looks looks safe but the ""automatic"" features of swinging itself is useless. The motor is too loud. And when you run either the nature sounds or the music there is a terrible screeth and grinding noise. So, the swing must be pushed manually with no ""auto power"" function at all due to terrible motor .. I am disappointed ..."
2,On the sixth new motor...,"We've gone through literally six ""NEW"" motors now. They may last a few weeks and then the swing stops completely or only works occasionally/rarely. This problem began within a few months of use and when my son was WELL under the 30 lb. weight limit. Graco's happy to keep sending new motors because they must surely know they won't work very long. Why buy a product that only works 50% of the time or where you're constantly having to get replacement parts because the originals (and then replacements) are faulty? I do not recommend this swing."
2,Like it however...,"This swing is cute and I put it together myself while I was late in my pregnancy so that is not the issue i have with this swing. Now that my daughter is alomost 6 months and is more active, I have almost gotten her fingers in the hinges twice while trying to close the tray. I was always worried about pinching her legs while closing the tray due to the design. So I was busy looking down at her legs the other day and meanwhile she grabbed at the side near the hinges as I was closing the tray. I think it's a comfortable swing but I dislike the tray design and feel it is potentionally a hazard. For that reason alone I would not recommend this swing. And I have to agree with other reviews about it not working all the time....sometimes it swings and sometimes it doesn't. Seems to have a mind of it's own..."
4,Excellent Swing,"We love this swing and so does our son!PROS: Easy in/out, varying swing speeds, sounds are very soothing, timer (This is possibly the best feature!)CONS:Uses up batteries quickly. I wish it had a plug in option."
3,Pretty Good Value,My only real issue with this is that the tray is very loud when you snap and unsnap it from the swinging carrier. The other issue was mobile placement - it clicked when the swing moved back and forth and when moved the baby was unable to see it clearly. Pretty good swing if your baby likes that kind of motion though - I just wouldn't snap the tray on.
2,Ehh.,"My son loved this swing until the motor burned out. The music still plays but it no longer swings. I ordered this swing because it had mostly good reviews although many said the motors stopped working. I chose to take my chances with it. After just 5 months of use the motor burned out. The reviews weren't dramatic, it really did stop working and not because of misuse or a heavy baby. We use the swing pretty often and my baby is only 16 lbs.I did contact Graco and they are willing to send out replacement parts but we are stuck without a swing until they show up.As far as the correct product and shipping time, I was completely happy with that."
3,Not bad,"Its a decent buy. My daughter who is 4 months old loves to have a nap in this swing. Other than that the mobile hung over is too high for the baby, she can't touch it and the music is horrible."
1,Bad product! Does not swing!!!!,"I'd have loved the swing if it worked! The buttons light up, the nature button produces some ghost sounds and the music is ok, however, the darn thing doesn't swing at any speed! I switched it off, started again to no avail."
3,Well...,"I waited to long and when I finally decided to buy this, they didn't have the color I wanted. But I'm happy with this one. It's a great product. The only thing I didn't like was that I bought the matching play pin and they were able to ship the play pin (I can not remember if it was the same company, believe it was though) to me but not this item. So I had to ship it to my mom and have her ship it to me. SUPPORT YOUR MILITARY AND SHIP APO/FPO!!!!!!!!!"
5,OMG I love this swing!,"I really really love this swing. It's got 6 speed settings, 2 different types of ""noise"" (music, nature) with a timer and volume control, can sit up or recline in 4 different positions. I've used expensive swings like a Disney one while we were on Vacation (which only had hi or low, which both were too fast! only music which you could hardly hear and DIDN""T RECLINE!!) My son is soo happy in his swing and often gets rocker to sleep in it! A must have!"
1,JUNK!!!!,well if i could give it negative stars i would but i cant! do yourself a favor do not buy this swing even if its the last one on earth and they offer to give you money. its that bad! this P.O.S. started to break 3 days after use and by the end of the week it had stopped working all together. The motors that operate the swing arent stong enough or suffer from defect. We ended up with the fisher Price swing and are happy thus far.
2,Poorly Made,"I borrowed this swing from a friend when I had my twins. Within 6 weeks the controls shorted out. Once you turned it on, you could not turn it off unless you removed the batteries. So I bought the same swing (I wanted to return a working swing to her). I used it for about 6 weeks & it did the same thing. Since it was new I called Graco & they sent me a replacement motor. Just a few weeks later I had to call Graco again because, yet again, it shorted out. They have sent me another replacement motor & I am going to put it together & return it to my friend because I HATE this swing. The reason it got 2 stars is because Graco has been fabulous. The swing would get 0 stars from me, but the customer service would get 5. My Fisher Price swing is still working great after 4 years & it has survived toddlers! If I had to buy another, I would get a Fisher Price swing."
1,Motor stops working!!,"Horrible swing! It was difficult to assemble, the seat material is not comfortable, the tray takes up half the seat (so we didn't attach it). The motor had problems on the first 3 levels with keeping the swing moving and then it died after about 5 weeks of use!! We only used it a few hours a day too!! I returned it to the store and purchased a fisher price plug in model and love it!! Don't waste your $$ on this!"
3,Deep seat good and bad,"I like the deep seat because I feel it creates a cozier atmosphere...however, I do feel that because it has no support under it my baby just kind of slumps down in it. His chin always rests directly on his chest which I know is a suffocation risk (I put a folded cloth diaper or blanket under his back to prevent this). If it had a slightly more rigid back, then he wouldn't slump so much and then I could give this swing a much higher rating because everything else about the swing (aside from the boring/colorless mobile) is great."
2,Not much fun,"My 5 year old seemed to like this game a little but I thought it was really boring. It's all chance with no skill or strategy involved. Frankly, it's just not that exciting and we don't really play it much at all."
4,"ruby rhino, kids like it",I work for a daycare with children ages 6-12. This was a good game. Not too hard to learn. Not too long to play. Gives some practice in addition. The only thing that would improve the game is if the coins would be metal instead of cardboard. Also more than 20 coins would be good as sometimes you are supposed to get a coin and the chest is empty so you get nothing. The one ear broke off the plastic rhino after one week.I would recommend the game because it is fun. Gamewright games are always a good bet.
5,"My 7 and 5 year old, and their friends, love this game.","A great game, that younger friends like to play. A game takes about 10-20 minutes and they will usually play a game or two at a time. I would highly recommend this game for this age group (5-7 year olds)."
2,extremely poor re-mastering,"I listen to many (re-mastered) historical recordings. Jeanette MacDonald is certainly one of my most favorite sopranos. For some reason, I haven't been able to find a decent, or even acceptable, re-mastering of her recordings.While this one certainly contains many valuable tracks, the re-mastering is horrid. The songs sound stripped yet still maintain a great deal of distracting noise. I conjecture that the re-mastering was done simply by increasing the bass and decreasing the treble."
2,availability,I have to have the Amazon app to watch it & my blue-ray dvd player does not have it. Thus I haven't watched yet!!!! This isn't right.
4,Helpful & Honest,"I found this book to be extremely helpful. I was out of college and lost in a sea of interviews and newspapers with hundreds of red circles strewn throughout the pages. I'm not going to say this book fixed everything, but it did offer me a lot of insight I'm not sure I would have thought of otherwise. One of those ""it's too obvious to recognize"" moments. I really liked the journaling, I didn't take 52 weeks to read this, as the author had intended, but like I said, I got a lot out of it and would definitely recommend it to a friend."
1,Not worth much,"This was a pretty pricy and thoroughly unhelpful guide. I bought it for my ""adult"" son ( a 20 something) with the thought it might help him keep a job; not much help here. Seems to be a dearth of literature on how to be a good employee (there's tons on how to be a good employer). I thought this would be an exception. I was wrong."
4,A Very Good Story.,"I enjoyed this story very much. I am a huge fan so of course, I like all Ms.Roberts books-- I have to admit however that I likedHeaven and Earth a little better than Once Upon A Rose."
1,This is a horrible boring book.....,"Sorry to say so but this one is far beyond worth the time to read or the money. It's really boring.I have to say that I really like fairy tales and fantasy books. But this one is not and really not what I thought it would be.All of the stories are almost the same and they all fell in love at once and it didn't seem real. Maybe short stories are very difficult to put up a good story line. because like the second story, I felt that is was rushing to the end but it really began quit intersting. If I have to choose, I think the second one was the only one worth reading.(...)"
5,Great,"I loved this book. It was in superb condition, it came quickly, and was exactly what I wanted! Thank you!"
2,"Slow, slow, slow!",I just couldn't get into this book at all. I finished about half of the first story and then put it down.
1,Let the book stand on it's own - Reviews by publisher and friends are not helpful!,"I still intend to buy the book since I read Congratulations I, II, & III. However what I found so strange about the reviews for this book were that at least 2 (or 3) reveiws were EXACTLY alike and the others were very similar. If the book(s) are good, let the readers tell it for themselves as it gives ratings of the books more credibility. Had it not been for reading the prior books? Based on these (seemingly suspect) reviews I would have never touched it. PS: Best wishes Mr. Lowery and great work on the Congratualtions series!"
4,"I'm proud to have this in my collection, but........",...it will tear your heart out. What a fantastic performer she was. What a tragic life. God bless her.
5,A fun-filled show that is a must have for Judy Garland fans!,"I love the music in this show! There are so many classic songs as well as one's I have never heard before, but are now some of my favorites. Very fun film to watch and/or listen to while putting up the tree or wrapping some gifts! Very fun show!"
4,Am I the Only One?,"Okay, I love Judy and think she is in a league by herself. Check out my other reviews and you know I'm a huge fan. However, it is very clear she is struggling on this show. Her face is lined, her eyes lack sparkle, she is clearly pushing herself to be charming and enthusiastic. Her voice while fine and and her performances sometimes reaching the expected Judy heights, lacks the thrill and sparkle of other occasions.I give her kudos for giving it her all. She clearly is and despite the rap on Judy that she only performed when she wanted to, here I'm sure she would have preferred to wait but had no choice. Still, I find it painful to watch Judy push herself to appear okay when its clear she wasn't."
5,"Read this once, second time is better","I been downloading some of my phisical books, this was a must have on my iPad. Exellent is better for me this time around."
2,Just okay...,Basic stuff really!! Positive thinking is all it boils down to. This type of book appears every ten years or so and this is one of the old ones.
3,Who printed it?,"I read this book a long time ago and found it very helpful, however this publication had several errors in spelling or use of the wrong word. Also it was not divided into chapters which I believe to be helpful. The original was."
5,Must read.,EVERYONE who can read should read this book. When you realize the ultimate power of your every thought you begin to think differently. I wish I had stumbled upon this book as I was studying to become a hypnotherapist. It certainly would have enhanced my practice.
2,"Interesting idea, but should have been a 2-page article","The idea promoted in this book is sound and deserves proper consideration. But after understanding it in the first few pages, I was simply skipping from page to page trying to find something that the author hadn't said yet - there was nothing. All but the first two pages of this book are full of repetitions of the one idea outlined in the beginning, and fake-sounding anecdotes trying to ""prove"" that the author is right.I didn't check whether Amazon offers a preview of the first few pages, but if it does - I suggest you read them and avoid buying the book itself."
3,It's Good - But lacks details,"Most of this book is a group of stories of people who've had success using their ""subconscious"" to achieve their desired results. It is NOT a step-by-step guide on how to use the principles of the people discussed in this book, although there is a high-level discussion on how to use the principals throughout the book. It's a long book, and I found myself expecting to find the meat of the book at the turn of the next page, never really finding it. Having said that, it's a good book, with lots of positive stories that helped me view things with a fresh and productive perspective. ."
5,Should be Required Reading,"This book is a blooming miracle. If there are things in your life you feel need changing, and you can read, you need this book. Period. It can be especially effective in having harmonious human relationships, even if such problems aren't your fault. (I intend to buy SEVERAL copies for friends.)"
2,"Love the book, the CD is ok",I absolutely recommend the book version of it. It gives good and practical information about how to use your subconscious mind in every area of your life. The CD is only a super fast (seriously) summary of the main points of the chapters. It is spoken at the speed of light. I am used to a more detail CD of a book where the reader speaks calmly and more slowly so you can actually get the information. It sounds like a an option sale to the highest bidder.
4,The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,I thought the ideas in this book were very good. The advice is solid and can help anyone overcome most challenges that life may hand them.The only item I found disappointing was the disclaimer near the front of the book that talks about the book not representing the values of today because it was a product of its time. I believe the book was written over 40 years ago. In my mind this book is a classic with the insight it gives.Tim Gibney
5,A life changing book,I learned so much from the sample I had to buy it. This is the most eye opening and empowering book I may have ever read. WELL worth a few bucks
5,Excellent book,Excellent book. Similiar to The Secret but this one was out long before that book and has a deeper explanation.
5,Simply life changing,This book was simply Awesome! I had gone online to read the reviews before I purchased the book; And found that most people felt the way I do after reading this powerful book. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to see life from a different angle. Enjoy!!
5,THE BEST BOOK ABOUT THE POWER OF YOUR MIND,This book is Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I strongly suggest reading this if you are a Christian.
1,Bunk Bible Crap,Be careful or the thought police or god will get you.Not what I expected after reading the hundreds of other reviews.Not one of them mentions anything about the religious bias on this book.
3,The power of your subconscious mind,A very indepth look at how your mind works and how it can be used to attract or get anything you desire
2,A paraphrased watered down version of PsychoCybernetics,"Basically the author read ""PsychoCybernetics"" written by Maxwell Maltz in 1960 and attempted to paraphrase the entire book (while leaving out critical details). It's a cheap watered down carbon copy that even occassionally plagarizes the original. If you want to read the best book ever written about the subconscious mind and circumvent all of the silly new age garbage (I.E. This book claims that the Biblical term ""LORD"" is actually referring to our subconscious mind.?) then pickup a copy of PsychoCybernetics. It is much better."
5,I have purchase several copies to give to friends,"I read this book many years ago and over the years have bought several copies to give to friends. I know it can work. I have experienced the power we all have within us. The hard part is not letting negativity creep into our thoughts.If one can have an open mind and be receptive to the message, this book can change your life."
5,It explains how and why things happen to you,"If you have ever wondered how God could be everywhere and everything to everybody, read this book... It helps you to understand how much control you have over your own life. Life is so simple after you read this book... you are in control, effortlessly and easily of your own destiny. You will realize that every thing you ever needed to be a success in life was given to you at birth. This book simply shows you how to access it. Of all the wisdom my Dad ever gave to me, this book was the greatest gift. Give it to your Son or Daughter."
3,Not the entire book on CD,"This CD has titles, subjects and highlights on what's in the actual book, ""Power of the Subconscious Mind."" By Joseph Murphy. I thought it was the entire book on CD but it is not. It is still okay but you don't get the meat and details of the book. For the price I paid, I wanted the entire book on CD."
1,Eh,This book isn't really what I thought it was going to be. I'm not a religious person and that's basically all this book is about. Referring to God a lot and praying and all that fun stuff. It may be a good book for some people but not for me.
4,Great,I have read this several times. Very powerful and opens you up to a whole new way of looking at the world
3,good read!,"Its a good read and has alot of great ideas. I was never able to master any of them though. I did try real hard, even read the book 3 times or more on some chapters. I was never fully able to manifest my dreams."
3,okay,This is okay for what it is. There are much better books out there that will teach you a lot more.
5,The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,"This book has explained the power of how ones mind works more than any other...I use it as a reference book, and my life has changed for the better since reading this easy to understand book..Have read all the books published by Joseph Murphy PhD.DD...This is the starting book, and keep it close to my bedside..My original copy of this book, I purchased in 1980, is now taped together because of the use..A nice gift to give also..."
3,Useful...but too little substance and too many pages,"I didn't know until I finished this book that it was first published in 1963. Even though it's very old, the content in this book is timeless. However, I find this book very wordy and repetitive.There's nothing new or interesting anymore once I understood the core idea. I could almost always predict what is it going be like in each subsequent chapter.The core idea, which can be grasped within the first few chapters, is that in order to manifest your desire, you must get into a sleepy, drowsy state, and affirm or visualize the result you want. Then your subconscious mind will bring it to pass."
3,"Good advice, BAD editing",I really like the content of the book but kept getting tripped up on the misspelled words...and there are tons of them! I wrote my first book a few years back and had my editor go over it with a fine tooth comb. If you can get past being rattled by this kind of imperfection (and I do live in an imperfect world so why worry)I know you will find the stories Joseph Murphy is sharing to be enlightening and promising for those who need a refresher or if you've just set out on a new path of exploring being a spiritual being having a human experience.p.s. I tried contacting the publisher of this book but they are out of business...surprise!!
2,very disappointing,This book was suggested by my counselor. I found offense in the very first chapter when the Author stated that all the knowledge in the universe is contained in your subconscious mind. Get real!
2,Size of print,"Book was in clean condition but barely readable. Even with my glasses, the print is very, very small. Could not read it. Am disappointed. They should have mentioned how small this print is in the description."
4,Worth it.,"Read only partial of it, but I would say it will definitely be a good book to keep your mind in positive state of mind. Hey, also, it is not very costly. Good luck with igniting your sub conscious mind with positive energy!"
2,Type font way too small,"I would have loved to read the book, but the font was so small that is was uncomfortable to read -- so much so that I sent the books back. I had ordered two -- one for me and one for a friend, and we were both uncomfortable with the type face. There was no selection with a larger type."
2,Review,"It is not what i thought its going to be, absoloutely rediculous wasting my time and hard earned money looking for this"
2,Big on content - small on Readability,"The content of the book is very interesting and inspiring. However, the typesize used throughout is 10 point Times Roman, single-spaced. If you print a few paragraphs in this typesize on your printer you will have a good idea of how easy - or not - it will be to read. This is the second book I have come across in 1 day where the publisher is trying to cram as much information into as few pages as possible. I hope this is not a new trend in book publishing."
1,subconscious,This is just a bunch of made up stories!! Don't get this one!! Did not work for me!! Had to trash it.
1,maudlin gibberish,"This book says, in essence, that if you think positively you'll do better. This book was pretty dumb. Make that very dumb. The world needs a lot fewer people telling other people to harness their subconscious mind. Real problems have real difficulties. This is too much akin to wishful thinking."
5,Faith conquers everything!.,I have read this book many times and if you asked me awhile ago what I thought of it I would of told you it was rubbish. A few months ago I re-read this book and applied the principles properly to find a beautiful and kind women. At first I thought it was by chance but then I knew in my heart that using the positive affirmations occasionally and with feeling made it all happen for me. If you want to buy one self-help book make this the one because you wont be disappointed!.
2,It's good...but it repeats the same idea over and over.,"I can tell you in few words what the book is about: you just have to believe something and repeat an idea many times a day. By doing this, you are ordering your subconscious mind to do something for you (for example: repeat to yourself ""I will get the job"", or ""I do not want to smoke""). If you think negative ideas, your subconscious mind will believe they are true and all this negative ideas will actually happen. Well, that's it. The book repeats this same idea over and over. If you still want to buy the book, go ahead."
5,Life changing!,"This is the most important book I have ever read! After watching ""The Secret"" I wanted to learn how to put the LOA (Laws of Attraction) into action.I originally purchased ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" but could not get through it due to the excessive preaching that God is the only answer to happiness. I returned to the book store and discovered ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind."" It was EXACTLY what I wanted. While Dr. Murphy is a deeply religious man, he does an excellent job without preaching!I have recommended this book to just about everyone I know and a lot I don't that could use its teachings.In addition to purchasing this book, I also recommend learning about EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique). You can find examples of it on YouTube."
1,Disappointing and rambling at best,"Got about a third through and perseved a couple more times but got very frustrated with the ridiculous claims of what the subconscious mind can do and control. Wouldn't recommend it. Not scientific, but appears based largely on the authors unsubstantiated beliefs."
4,Very Interesting,"This is a very interesting book! Not sure if I am sold on the whole concept, but it was well worth my time and money. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an open mind. I was able to take away some useful information that I have applied to my career."
4,A very useful read,"If you suffer from anxiety or a deep fear, you are not alone; this is a part of the human condition. But we don't have to suffer endlessly because anxiety has an internal structure in the form of negative thoughts and beliefs powered by emotional energy that has become frozen in place. Uncover these patterns of negative thoughts and you are on the way to making significant change. As a mindfulness-based psychotherapist, I use mindfulness as the primary tool for doing just this, and I would recommend anyone to learn more about the therapeutic use of mindfulness in conjunction with good self-analysis. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' by Dr Peter Strong, an in-depth exploration of mindfulness meditation."
5,The Power of Your Subconscious Mind - Dr. Joseph Murphy,"In 1974 I was given the book ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind"" The book was a present to me from my boss and mentor.....And, before a year was up, my life changed completely. It takes practice and it takes faith....but, I can tell you it's worth it and it works. Since that time I have given away over 50 copies as presents, and I usually include a copy of ""The Game of Life and How To Play It"" by Florence Scovill Shinn.....These two books alone will change your life if you understand, practice, and above all believe. Don't just read them once or twice....read them everyday, over and over, pieces at a time, for the rest of your life, and soon you too will be buying them by the case to give to every person you meet. Be prepared for amazing things to happen to you."
3,OK,I have to say I was not impressed by this book at all. I expected more from the advertising. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Great Book for Everyone!,"The subconscious mind is where all your habits exist and this books gives you the tools to train it and get the results you want by changing the way you think.PERFORMANCE PLAYBOOK: Feeding Your Potential from the Neck Up in Athletics, Fitness and Life"
1,garbage of high level,"Subconscious mind is a dark place, you know nothing about. I hoped to learn how to make subconscious conscious. But books like this one make this dark place a god, and allow it to control and fulfill your life and teach you how to control and manipulate people and circumstances for your ego trips. The end of this will be a total crash.I do not recommend this book to anybody. This is false."
1,Drawn Out New Age,"I thought this would be an empowering book that would teach me. It turned out to use a lot of common sence that would be helpful if everyone didn't know it already. Then there's also some crazy stuff - for example, you can heal someone accross the country - using your subcontious mind."
2,A big disappointment,"I have read the book twice, I really like it. The audio CD is terrible. It has two glaring faults.First, it is read far too fast. It sounds as if they had 60 minutes of material and only 45 minutes of recording time, read far too fast.Second, their is virtually no content. All they reader does is read list after list. 1st...2nd...3rd. For chapter after chapter.If you haven't read the book, you would have absolutely no idea how to use the skills the author teaches.A real disappointment."
2,Too much Religon,"The beginning of this book is pretty good. The author does show us how to work with and train our subconscious. After awhile though, it just becomes one self-healing story after another, and a lot of Bible references. I had to skim 3/4 of this book."
5,Should be required reading for everyone on earth.,"This book gives you pragmatic techniques for improving anything in your life. If you want happiness then the answer is in this book. I found this book accidentally a while back, and I read it through briefly. I rejected some of the concepts then. I once again began to read it and I realized that what he gives you is a lot of plain common sense. At first it will seem weird, however a lot of it follows logically. Like his notion that you are what you think all day long. This book is the answer to any problem you may be having. It's so simple too, and the techniques are so simple it's unbelievable. The only thing I have against this book are some erroneous concepts which are presented in the book, like his claim that the subconscious mind is capable of clairvoyance. This has not been supported by scientific fact. However, besides that this book is a 10."
1,Misleading with no scientific evidence,I was looking for something scientific about the subconscious mind. What I found was religious and misleading. None of the things that are said in this book were backed up with any scientific evidence.
5,BEST FUNDAMENTAL OUTLOOK ON SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OUT THERE,"I would recommend this book TO EVERYONE IN THE WORLD... Even if you have no idea what this book is about- BUY IT NOW!!!I've read several on the subject and while this is a very basic outlook that doesn't go too far in-depth, it is still very informative.If you are the person who needs scientific evidence in order to believe anything, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU!If the above statement applies to you, I would suggest ""The Cat in the Hat"""
1,"Religious, unsubstantiated woffle","I couldn't finish reading this book due to the number of contradictions and religious inferences. I respect that this collection of ideas may be the authors beliefs but he expresses it as a dogma to follow. If you decide to purchase and read this book, my recommendation would be to do so with an intelligent and discerning mind."
5,Amazing book!!!!!!!!,I bought this book with great aspiration & it delivered.Iam so glad that I read it & i even bought copies for my sister & my friend. The book talked about all the aspects of life & the stories were incredible.I trully recommend that everybody would read it with an open heart & an open mind.
2,"Great techniques, but could mislead","In my country most techniques described in this book has been a common knowledge of spiritualists and martial artists alike, I couldn't find anything new in the book except that the concept was described in more scientific(-like) way.And, one basic thing is missing.You cannot find the meaning of your life using such techniques. Maybe you can improve your health, wealth, ability etc. etc., but meaningful life comes from something higher (or deeper). I am afraid Dr. Murphy got too excited with the techniques and forget to discuss the foundation.I prefer Steven covey's 'Seven Habits of Highly Effective People'. It covered the very foundation of our life first before moved into techniques.Maybe these two book could make a good pair?"
2,"If you're familiar with the law of attraction, you may not need this book.","I've given this book two stars because while I personally found it pretty useless, I'm sure others may benefit. Basically, I feel that if your familiar with the secret, the law of attraction, the power of prayer, and understand that your thoughts are important and should be spent thinking positive thoughts rather than negative ones, basic concepts, than like me, your probably wont find this book enlightening. In fact, I didn't find anything relevant until the last couple chapters of the entire book which also wasn't necessary to read. The subconscious mind is a very powerful and fascinating subject that should be studied and no doubt has a profound power to heal. However, for me, this book was not a resource I was hoping it would be."
5,Great!,This book is a blue print on how to train your mind to do what you want to accomplish in life.
2,Subconscious,"This is a great subject. The content is good, but the book I received has no chapters. It is like a run-on sentence. It does not have an index either. I have no idea why this is the way it is, but it is very annoying and I have trouble continuing to read it."
5,power of subconscious mind,"first of all i appreciate the ease of purchasing books from amazon.com. i bought prior books tht i found hard to read and understand, returning them ws not a problem.the current book, ""POWER OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND"", readS with ease, easy to understand, and has instructional use of the material wrtten about. the books i purchase, deal with ""SPIRITUAL SEARCH""; UNDERSTANDING THE MIND""; ""QUANTUM PHSICS THEORIES"", SINCE IT DEALS WITH MATTER, AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE MIND. THE CURRENT BOOK HAS A LOT DIRECT INFORMATION. MY STYLE OF READING SUCH BOOKS IS ""STUDY"" AND ""REVIEWING"" SOME TIMES I DO NOT READ IN SEQUENTIAL CHAPTERS, MAY-BE I MOVE UP TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOOK TO GET IDEAS OF WHERE SUBJECT IS GOING??? HAVE ENJOYED THE CURRENT BOOK AND SUBJECT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.SINCERELYEDWARD L. ARMIJO"
2,The Power of your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy,"This is a awesome book to read. It is life Changing. I recommend everyone should read this book. I really enjoyed it. I rate this book as a five star. Barbara, Maryland"
1,The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,"Religious propaganda! Not the psychological enlightenment I thought I was getting. As an atheist, I found this book to unhelpful and down right irritating. I did not receive a scientific book about the brain and it's workings. The book is an advertisement for Christianity and nothing more. I prefer not having religion shoved at me needlessly. It will do nothing to sway my mind. Save yourself the money and do not purchase this book. The author has made way more than he should have off of this piece of propaganda trash."
5,Excellent book,"Very thought provoking and intriguing book. Offered a vast amount of insight on how to use your subconscious mind for a better, healthier life."
2,"Too religious, not very scientific","I was looking for an educated book on the subconscious and I purchased this one based on the great reviews. The reasons for it's success are beyond my understanding. The book is too religious that is actually distracting. Just in it's second page, it asks the reader ""do you know how to pray effectively?"", the word ""God"" is used everywhere and each chapter contains at least one quote from the Bible. The book would make more sense if it were entitled ""The Power of Your Prayers"". With a title like that, the book would be decent. But I'm not concern about praying, I wanted to learn about the subconscious and I feel completely mislead with this book and it's title. I honestly feel like giving the book away."
2,great subject but a dissapointing approach,"This book was great at the start. It promised to be really fascinating material, and there is some really eye opening information presented. But to any one who has read the bible thoughtfully, Dr Murphy's interpretation and presentation of scripture is erroneous. I know that concrete results are presented, but the conclusions - where the bible is concerned - are more accurately termed as Dr Murphy's opinions.The subject of the subconscious mind fascinates me, but I would rather get my facts from another source. I personally find the mixture of religions with facts a little off putting. For example, if the bible, which I am familiar with is misquoted, what about the sources that I am not familiar with?"
5,The best Spanish-English English Spanish dictionary!,"After reviewing a lot of dictionaries, each one claiming to be the best and most authoritative in its kind, my choice was the Oxford Spanish Dictionary. It has entries for the uses of Spanish from different countries, including Latin America, Spain and also, ""old/archaic"" entries, and idioms. Plus, it shows you how to apply a particular word or phrase, which could be the same for everybody, but could have all sorts of different connotations depending on the context or the country where you are. It is absolutely great and I had recommended it to anyone that has asked me for a good Spanish-English dictionary."
5,Super Dictionary,"Not one Spanish word so far has been missing from this dictionary. You might have to change the word to its infinitive form to find rare words, but this is the very best Spanish Dictionary I have ever used. The format is so good that fingering through to find words is easy and fast, even though this is a big book. It is so easy to use I never notice the size. I cannot be without this dictionary; it is that extaordinary."
5,Definitive!,"This is the definitive source for Spanish help! The most highly recommended Spanish dictionary, this resource is invaluable!"
5,"Exhaustive, Scholarly Work","Godet's Commentary on Romans is one of the most exhaustive Bible commentaries I've ever used. Godet analyzes every word in every verse, often presenting contrasting interpretations before presenting his own well-founded conclusions. With such detail, it is a long, tedious document, but it is filled with gems of insight for the serious Bible student."
3,"Learning Algebra ""using this book"" is Hard!","If you are learning algebra for the very first time, this is not the book to use. There are not enough examples in the book to help you really understand the concept at hand. It is very confusing at times. The authors try to add a little humor in the book which is very annoying. Overall it is not a bad book if you have a strong background in math and want to brush up on your skills."
3,Interesting theories - worth the read,This book presents some very interesting concepts on the development of the human brain and human civilization. The book is a large collection of very short essays which becomes the weakness of the book. Much of each essay seems to be a repeat of a previous essay. This book is in severe need of a good editor who could reformat the prose to speed things along.Its worth the read - even when I have to slog through some redundant material.
1,A Waste of Time,"Don't waste your time with this book, absolute hogwash and difficult to read. It will end up collecting dust and get thrown in the rubbish!"
4,Different Horsebook .. Highly Recommended,"Very entertaining and thought provoking book, which focusses on the relationship between horse and horseman from a historical and practical perspective. Very different from all horsebooks I have read. It helped me look at the course of history and my own relationships with horses (and improve my riding) from a different angle.Four out of five stars as I think that it could have been an even tighter and incisive book. I hope there is going to be a sequel called the Centaur Future."
5,A fascinating rite of passage,"I won't repeat what others have summarized about the content of this book. The story appealed to me on many levels. As a birder, it is indeed exciting to read the accounts of the multitudes of species seen. Once you realize that there are hundreds of different birds around you there is an understandible desire to SEE them all. (It's a way of collecting that doesn't require much storage space). As someone who grew up in the post-hitch-hiking era (who would dream of living this way now?), I can experience vicariously a lost way of life. The deepest impression that this book left on me was the transformation within the author from simply wanting to SEE all of the birds to wanting to really KNOW the birds and devote a lifetime to learning and discovery. It is on this level that the author speaks to all of us, for we all find (or hope to find) our own passion."
2,Boring.,"This book will make you wish you had never started a ""life list."" I found the endless ""I went here and saw such and such"" really tiresome. It lacks any personal insight. It made me realize how really pointless all this listing and competition among birders is."
3,freedom on the road,I must say travel essays are becoming my favorite read and this book was an enjoyable one. The author does not leave the novice birder in the dust in his birding quests and actually envelopes the reader in his lust to see/hear the many birds he enjoyed. For the avid birder this is highly recomended.
1,STILL NOT RECIEVED MY ITEM,POOR SERVICE IT'S BEEN 3 WEEKS AND I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY ITEM!!!!!!!!!!! VERY UPSET AND UNHAPPY WITH MY YOUR SERVIVCE.......tracking information still not even available
1,Rubbish,"My husband has been verbally abusng me for years, he read this book & it is so full of rubbish & so open the the interpretation that he now claims to be the victim!"
4,"So far, just ok","I have not finished the book, but so far, it does not apply to my relationship as much as I thought it would."
5,Verbally Abusive Relationships,"Patricia Evans does a wonderful job of describing a variety of specific characteristics found in verbally abusive relationships. She gives enough detail to be practically useful, and gives good suggestions on possible responses to different situations. I especially appreciated her discussion of Power Over vs Personal Power, and how it is that people end up in these relationship dynamics. The book has relevance far beyond personally abusive relationships."
5,This book saved my soul,"Verbal abuse kills your soul one word at a time. This book helped me realize that no amount of explaining on my part would ever get through to my husband how his words damaged me and others. After 20 years, it hit me that he will never change. Please realize that verbal abusers can be women as well as men (the author doesn't emphasize this enough). All in all, this is the most helpful book I have ever read. It saved my life and my soul.Too Good for Her Own Good: Searching for Self and Intimacy in Important Relationships"
3,Interesting anecdote about this book. Good tool.,"I have read elsewhere that it constantly amazes a woman who deals daily with abused victims,... how often when victims read this particular book,... they feel like the abuser describes them. I'd had that feeling when I read this book,... except for a couple of sections (the discounting was right on in describing my guy). I found that very interesting. I think it comes down to the feeling underneath it all. If you feel like a victim of abuse,.. and seek out this book only to find you feel it says you are the abuser,... know this feeling is common. The book was worth it for me for the discounting section alone. I wouldn't get this book to get the ""abuser"" to understand his ways,.. because it would be easy for him to twist it around. But this book is invaluable as a tool to help you deal with being in an abusive situation."
2,Sadly lacking in help for abused men,Much-needed book but sadly lacking in help for male victims of verbal abuse. Although recent research indicates that men are as often the victims of abuse as are women the author ignores their plight. The author erroneously claims verbal abuse is a gender issue - of men abusing women.
5,Enlightening,"This book was extremely eye opening! It is a must read for anyone who thinks they could be abused. It validates and describes verbal abuse and it's effects on the partner. This book clearly put a year long hellish relationship in perspective. I am healing and have moved on from a person that could have destroyed me with his mean, manipulating, condescending ways. There is a light at the end of the tunnel."
5,Eye opener for victims of abuse,"I did group work with victims of domestic violence for many years. Abuse victims rarely fit the stereotypes that abound about them. More often than not, victims fail to see constant verbal assault as violent or as them being in an abusive relationship. Families and friends get frustrated/mad, abandon, or become judgmental of victims because they can't comprehend how they can remain in painful or dangerous relationships. Patrica Evans' book is a great tool for cracking through the denial that inevitably sets up over time; and it provides some insight to their loved ones and family. I'm retired, but in the volunteer work I still do, I keep extra copies to give away. I don't think you can beat it as an eye opener for the victim as s/he can so-easily identify with the personal stories in this work."
5,Verbally Abusive Relationship,"If you question your spouses motives, feel you are being put down, controled verbally or are led to believe you have an issue from your spouse and they have none; get this book. You realize you are not the only one out there dealing with this type of relationship and that there are options. Make it a gift for yourself or someone you believe could be encouraged by reading this. It has been eye opening for me."
5,Very helpful read,"This book was very informative, helpful, easy to read. It was exactly what I was told it would be, a very useful toolto help unravel the complexities of verbally abusive relationships. It is very validating."
4,A wake up call!,"After dealing with an abusive relationship for so long, this book is an eye-opener. Another really good book is This Can't Be Love! by Patricia Goins. Not only will you not be able to put the book down, but it is also a life changing novel!"
4,Highly recommended.,"This book was recommended to me by a friend in the mental health field, and I was quite impressed with it. I highly recommend it to anyone who feels that she is in an unhealthy relationship, be it romantic or otherwise. I do, however, feel that one should supplement the reading of this book with other books, such as ""Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them"" by Dr. Susan Forward, and ""Women Who Love Too Much,"" by Robin Norwood. This is not to say that ""The Verbally Abusive Relationship"" was lacking, per say, but I feel that it is important that one gain as much insight as possible into a situation and, as painful as it is, come to fully understand one's role in said situation.-A student with a fairly decent background in psychology who feels very strongly on the subject of verbal/emotional abuse."
1,"A big Fat ""F""!!","I have read this book several times and am amazed how she has been able to fool the masses. This book gets a big fat F in my book!1.) She gives no indication of a professional standing in psychotherapy.2.) She does not appear to provide any scientific studies to support her thesis.3.) Her idea of a ""survivor"" appears to be a divorced family. Statistics show these are not healthy environments.4.) No professional organization appears to have backed her work.5.) All of her accounts are of one side of an abusive relationship.6.) She claims psychotherapy is patriarchal, without backing it up. Yet we are to believe her non scientific work is valid.7.) She runs a horrible bulletin board were the blind are doing eye surgery on themselves. Dissenters, no matter how nice, are not allowed and are removed.8.) Many of her suggested responses to abuse are by her own definitions abusive.This list goes on."
1,Nice Try! - Your relationship should = The Earth & Squirrels,"Patricia Evans tries to tie all of ""her"" universal beliefs to individual relationships. She equates forces of nature and the relationship between earth and its inhabitants with the relationship between two individuals that can communicate.Her book only addresses one scenario (abusive husband, abused wife) in only one context (Reality I vs. Reality II)While I will agree that an abusive person does not just wake up one day and say, ""oh my, see what I have done, I want to change."" I think you have to say a person does not wake up one day and say ""I want to be verbally abusive starting today!""I think if your life falls into the narrow scenario presented in this book, you can find value in reading it. If your scenario is at all different, then this book is a real stretch and most likely interesting but irrelevant."
1,This book is AWFUL!,"This is a very important topic, and one that I have taken very seriously. However the author has done a terrible job of addressing the issue. While there are some great points in this book, they are lost in the horrible atmosphere she has created. My wife and I have read this book at the suggestion of our counselor. Our home has become a living hell! Every sentence uttered is disected. Even the most caring and innocent attempts at communication are now suspect. In painting only men as the issue, and in casting a net so large that ANYTHING a man says to a woman can be called abusive, this author has DAMAGED my marriage more than helped it.Do yourself a favor. Find a book that addresses the issue in a more balanced way. It will take months, if not years, to undo the damage this book has caused in our lives..."
1,Patricia Evans is a quack!,"This book is the most biased thing on the planet! Mrs. Evans, in this book, all she talks about is hating men! That is the most UNHELPFUL attitude on the planet! I agreed with another reviewer that said that all the book does is teach how to hate, and than escalate it. Another reason why I hated this book is the one-sidedness-there is NOTHING negative about a female in this book, when they can do it just as much as a male could! Mrs. Evans should do something constructive with her life, like open a Abused Women's Clinic instead of writing this trash."
5,The Verbally Abusive Relationship,I just started reading this book last night. I am still in my abusive realtionship and debating if I am going to tell him what he is doing. I have been very depressed for almost four years thinking for sure I am crazy. I have been in therapy for about a year and slowly it has been helping. This book is already proving to be awsome. I have already suggested it to two other friends. I am already in a much happier optimistic mood about the future just reading half this book. It has been so right on. If you even think your being abused read this book.
4,This book showed me a light at the end of a tunnel.,"This book was a great help to me, I was in an abusive relationship filled with hate and emotional blackmail. When my husband turned about 30 he changed dramatically into someone I wanted to avoid at all costs. I tried so hard to be what he wanted me to be, and I stayed always thinking that things would get better, but they didn't. At the time I had a 4 year old and was a stay at home mom. The only way to describe the pain is to say that my soul died with the harsh words. My son is the only sunshine that kept me going day to day. Now a year later, I'm on my own, with a good full time job, and will be closing on my own home in a few weeks, with a patched up soul. My message to anyone here is please read this book, no one needs to be screamed at. No one should have to endure the pain of the hurtful words that a spouse throws out. We are all special, and in a marriage should encourage our spouse and not degrade. YOU ARE SPECIAL."
5,Possibly one of the most important books a woman can ever read,"Whether you're in an abusive relationship, you think you might be in an abusive relationship, or you are just starting to date and you don't want to end up in one, this book is absolutely essential reading. Buy it for your daughter, your sister, your best friend, the women you work with.Every woman needs to understand the early warning signs of an abuser so she doesn't end up dating one or married to one. These men aren't covered in tatoos. They don't carry weapons. They can be the blond haired, blue eyed, doctor or the suave businessman. And every woman who ends up with one can't believe it happened to her. These women are smart, successful, and know how to take care of themselves. They simply didn't see the signs. They made excuses for his behavior. They were sucked in slowly. Don't let it happen to you. Read this book. It will open your eyes and save your life."
5,Crystalizes ungraspable experiences,"Pick up this book if dealing with your partner brings up feelings of your ineptness in his/her eyes, invalidation, FEAR, oppression, disenfranchisement to feel your feelings, a sense that you're a nuissance to your partner, or you feel stripped of your confidence and sense of self worth. Verbal abuse is not only overt, but covert which can be most damaging due to its insidious nature. If you're having feelings which you can't name, but are signals that somehow something is destroying your sense of wholeness as a person - pick up this book. It will help you name the feelings whose identities escape you. But, do pick up complementary books as this one serves to ""identify"" and not so much give explanations."
1,Men are bad bad baddies and women are good good goodies,"It's a shame the author presents a sexist one sided treatise on verbal abuse. If Ms. Evans is anything she is consistent in her diatribe against men. Having lived in a relationship where verbal abuse exists on both sides, I find it incredulous that in this enlightened age the author could be so ignorant when it comes to gender issues.Men if you see your female partner reading this book, head for the hills. You are being unfairly maligned by the female equivalent of a Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard spewing hatred against men."
2,Chunk this book and start acting like a lady,"Ms. Evans makes an observation that the verbally abusive relationship lacks characteristics of mutuality and respect. This being true, I submit that a woman in such relationship is engaging in disrespectful behavior. Be it premarital sex, doing more than one's share of chores, serving to please the man, enabling his bad behavior, allowing the abuse, a man will treat a woman the way she ""asks"" to be treated. In the perpetrator-victim-rescuer triangle, Ms Evans will serve as your favorite rescuer if you wish to stay stuck. Otherwise... chunk this book, start acting like a lady, serve God and God alone, and your man may very well surprise you. Maria S. Atlanta, GA"
1,Prejudice against men,"This book was the worst book I have ever read. It is totally biased against men. It basically states this in the foreword, and succeeds in carrying the basic premise that woman can only be victims of verbal abuse throughout the entire book. One problem with this premise is that men who are victims of verbal abuse won't talk about it. But with today's woman are victims culture, men are the scapegoat. This book continues this scapegoat premise. I just ended a 25+ year relationship with a borderline personality disorder ex-wife, and I will tell you now that I was the victim of manipulation and verbal abuse. And every example Patricia sites, fits my relationship, only I was the receiver of the abuse. But there is no way I ever would have admitted it before now. Through counseling, I realized just how bad she was to me, and just how lopsided the outside view of this problem is. This book should be removed from print until it can be written in amore balanced presentation."
3,Interesting but too pessimistic,"Interesting book, sucked me right in. However, I have a more positive approach towards life; I think people can grow, learn and change. Verbal abuse is just a sad expression of unmet needs. Exploring those needs might end the vicious circle.So, I think the book shows the world an people in too dark light."
3,Relationship analysis,"This book is very ""text bookish"" and I feel it would be beneficial to have written this book as more of a story line and not so much repetition. I was hopefull that Patricia could have focused more on the ""abuser"" becoming less abusive and more cooperative with his mate. I do like the short questionares she recommends to take to determine an abusive status in a relationship. There is truely much to gain by this book, but I feel a more personable approach would have been better."
1,Man-Hater,"This book seems to be written by a woman with a chip on her shoulder after talking to 40 other women. From the opening premise that most verbal abuse comes from men, the tone was clear. Further, her premise leaves one to conclude that if accused one must be guilty. Since in the authors view verbal abusers typical deny it, and avoidance of discussion is verbal abuse, one is guilty whether one disagrees, doesn't discuss the topic, or agrees. The author describes male communication patterns of sharing information as abuse versus female patterns of sharing emotions as healthy. There is no recognition of legitimate gender differences which have been recognized and celebrated by so many other authors. While there is a willing audience out there to eat up this drivel, it seems to be the makings for the next Jerry Springer show."
5,This book caused a physical reaction of shock--literally!,"Reading this book made me physically ill--I could not read it for long periods of time. My heart raced; my mouth was dry and my blood ""ran cold."" Coming to understand what I had been living with for over 40 years--verbal abuse--was so painful that I could not face it all at once. The loss of my denial provided such a frightening revelation that my views on relationships, people, society and power went through fundamental changes. This book is a very powerful tool for identifying and changing abusive relationships, therefore I give it 5 stars, but it is also gender-biased and has an extreme feminist political agenda. I would like to see the issue of abuse of men by women addressed, and the possibility of reciprocal and complicit behaviors discussed. But, it is an eye-opener that can change lives."
5,Book Review,"I am amazed at the insight of author Patricia Evans into such a complex subject as The Verbally Abusive Relationship. I have already told about 35 people about the book. From the moment I read the preface and introduction I knew that I was not alone in my experiences. In my personal life, I had never experienced a relationship of this sort until this past year, so I had no idea that the verbal abuser was an actual ""type"" who exists out there many times over. I cannot emphasis just how exact Ms Evan's insight is , sometimes down to the very phrases that the abuser says repeatedly. It is a must read for those in these very confusing types of relationships and for those who have friends and loved ones caught in this type of situation."
2,prejudice and ignorant towards men,men are not the only ones to dish out verbal abuse. your one sided portrayal and slander of the verbally abusive man is not realistic. it may be good for women but should be rewritten if it is to be received well by men too. perhaps the author should travel less and focus more on the emotional needs and abusive relationships of men too.
4,Doesn't address alcoholism,"The book is good for what it's worth, but it doesn't address alcoholism at all. The first thing a partner of a verbal abuser should consider is whether there is alcoholism involved. Then it's a whole other issue!"
2,you will feel abused after reading this book,A very simplistic look at a very serious and complicated issue. Evans illustrates her ignorance into the basic differences between men and women that any PSY101 student or reader of men are from mars...knows. She too easily characterizes simple miscommunication problems as evidence of abuse...without the possibility of error. She assumes everything is done with malice aforethought.This is truly a serious issue and we trivialize it if we lead everyone to feel abused with such broad generalizations.
2,An author writes a book for whatever reason,"reading books is a part of life. This book was short lived for me, however, the author remains in my conscience as one example of what I believe to be irresponsible writing."
1,Too much bias to be objective.,"When one deals with extremes, it is too easy to be conclusive and yet wrong."
1,Worse than awful: This book is damaging to society!,"I agree completely with the post by Warren Gray. This is a lopsided, bigoted, biased diatribe, penned by an obviously predjudiced person, totally without objective method or purpose. As Warren points out, the author shows absolutely no scientific or even non-scientific evidence to support her ludicrous proposition that men are biologically or socially disposed to be the abuser in relationships. Thank God I didn't let my abusive spouse see this (which I had bought with hopes she might read it and see her behavior). Unfortunately, I didn't do my homework before the purchase. I read the intro, and then threw it in the trash.Of course, other reviewers who may agree with the author's bias, either haven't read the book, or are themselves bigoted. From my experience, woman are far superior to men in the ""skills"" of verbal dominance and abuse. Just ask Dr. Laura!"
2,"Frighteningly inaccurate premises, some helpful techniques","As a licensed counselor who specializes in violent relationships and women's issues, I was frankly horrified by the unprofessionally simplistic, Evil-Abuser-Innocent-Victim mentality upon which Ms. Evans' work is built. She would have done abused women a better service by leaving out the first seven chapters and sticking strictly to the communication aspects of abusive relationships. Her specific techniques for responding to verbal inappropriateness are helpful."
5,Excellent book!!!! Priceless information.,I read this book in two days and have given it to my spouse to read. This is what we have been looking for to help heal our relationship. Very good people can be effected by verbal abuse either through their own use or anothers. It can really damage a relationship. I purchased another copy for a friend. Prior to giving it to her I loaned the copy to my mother. She returned it the next day because it was so interesting she bought one for herself. I highly recommend this book. It was a very easy read with priceless information and insight. Patricia Evans really connected and put it on paper. Thank you! Thank you! I also recommend Why Does He Do That? by Lundry Bancroft.
4,"More appropriately titled ""The Verbally Abusive Male""","Although the content and dynamics of verbal abuse are described in clear, interesting, useful ways, the anti-male slant of this book is irritating. The author's data is based on personal experiences counseling women (and very few men) and on 40 intensive interviews with women. The author's conclusion, therefore, that men are for more likely to be verbally abusive is simply a logical, methodological tautology. This analysis is a very good example of selection bias posing as objective data collection. Worth reading because of the useful typology of verbal abuse and strategies for dealing with this abuse. However, the men-as-abusers complemented by the women-as-victims orientation simply adds further support for the unsuppored Men are From Mars, Women Are From Venus Misconception. (This review is written by a professor of communication studies who has taught intimacy and interpersonal communication for nearly three decades.)"
2,"Important, but biased.","First of all, I did read the book from the first to the very last page. Unfortunantely I have to agree with some other reviewers, that in contrast to the title, it's more about the verbally abused women. So yes, the book did help me to realize, that I have been verbally abused. But I also have to admit that I all this blaming men for all the abuse on the planet and totally blanking out the fact that there is also a lot of verbal and emotional abuse of women towards men did leave me a bit disappointed."
5,One Of The BEST Books Ever Written!,"One Of The BEST Books Ever Written! I first bought this book over 12 years ago! Most think verbal abuse is screaming and cussing...put downs etc...""I just want you to be happy"" boy..what an eye opener back then..especially when I check every box for my EX spouse!... I have a friend whose a counselor...and he now uses it in group sessions...."
5,Hit the nail on the head,"Was lent to me at a Women's Refuge. Am now in a position of helping a fellow victim.Understanding and realizing the dynamics of such a relationship took the fear of ending it away, just like reading up on birth takes away the fear of birth complications.It was almost as if my ex-defacto had taken a script from every page. Most comforting was realizing I wasn't alone in my experience - hard to describe to friends who only see the bloke as ""such a nice guy"". Gave me the courage to go through with court proceedings pertaining to AVO's, parenting orders etc., resisting the temptation to go back, and successfully avoiding such relationships thereafter."
4,Just what I needed,"I was referred to read this book by a friend and former boss. It was what I needed at this point in my life. This is an informative and instructional book about how our ego's begin to take over our lifes in often times negative ways and how to recognize the egos workiing and learn how to become present, thereby weakening the egos hold on our lives. Just what the Dr. ordered.Also, I love this book seller. they ship very quickly and my books always arrive within a weeks time."
4,Helped me understand,Towards the end of one of my relationships I had experience with this type of abuse. It hurts and this book helped me over come the hurt and pain produced by this type of abuse.
5,An easy-to-use guide especially meant to be used and enjoyed by bird lovers,"Hardcover for durability and spiral-bound to lay flat for easy reference, The Songbirds Bible is a straightforward, visual directory of 100 of the most common and beloved songbirds in North America. Ornithology professor Dr. Noble S. Proctor applies his 40 years of field experience to create detailed entries for each species, including descriptions of distinctive plumage colors, origin, behavior, distribution in North America, feeding and migration habits, how to attract a given species to one's garden, and much more. Highly detailed color illustrations of each species aid in visual identification, and an accompanying music CD of birdsongs will help both novice and seasoned birdwatchers recognize different species by song. An easy-to-use guide especially meant to be used and enjoyed by bird lovers."
3,A capable addition to a crowded field,"Creating Leaderful Organizations presents a paradigm of mutual - rather than heroic - leadership. It transforms leadership from an individual property to a collective responsibility. Raelin details how 'leaderful' practice can accomplish the critical processes of leadership more effectively than any existing approach. At the heart of the book is observation of success of self-organizing teams in which no one person appears to be exercising hierarchical control. Raelin argues that, so far from being 'leaderless', these teams or groups are 'leaderful', a term that he then overuses in an apparent attempt to give it wide currency."
4,What a thoughtful gift of words for the world...,"Thank you, Fadi, for your beautiful collection. Give yourself a gentle gift, support this author, and read this book."
4,"Edwards Deming,","Great ideas represented in this book, but lots of repeating of the same. I find this with most American authors. They write good books, easily digestible, but then run in circles, talking about the same stuff on hundreds of pages. Why not write an essay on 20-30 pages. I am willing to pay the same price.Nevertheless, this book is worth reading."
5,Deming - The New Economics,"In this book W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The system of profound knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows how a style based on cooperation rather than competition can help people develop joy in work and learning at the same time that it brings about long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job and grades in school."
4,Shorter Deming book,"W. Edwards Deming is the man who tried to tell America how to make industry more effective. Few listened, so he went to postwar Japan and revolutionized their industry instead. When American industrial leaders saw Japan beating them, then they got interested. Almost anything by Deming is a must-read for his commonsense but statistically-based theories for productive, happy work. The New Economics is pretty short but introduces a lot of the points. For the in-depth view, read his Out of The Crisis."
4,Must read for any manager!,"Deming's ""The New Economics"" is a great basis for any person looking to be not just a good manager, but a great one. His book discusses the problems of current management and how to solve these issues. Deming clearly illustrates his concept of common cause variation and also how management by results is ineffective. Overall, this book is a very easy read and extremely straight forward."
5,IME 415 the new economics review,"Dr. Demming introduced in this book a new style of management which he basically covered in his simple 14 points of management using the idea of profound knowledge. It was very interesting the way he approached different scenarios with multiple examples that he encountered first hand through his time in industry, stressing the fact that ranking within a system is completely wrong and should be completely removed. Demming pushes group work and cooperation instead of programs such as incentives and commissions due to the fact that they turn into individual profit centers and ultimately lead to the collapse of the system. His ideas were simple to follow throughout the text and is a great book for people in management positions to read and consider."
4,Never never,"To be honest,i hate the Libertines.Their singer and their drug filled songs.However,never never came along and it is one of the best songs ive ever heard in my life.Can't stand me now is supposed to be brilliant for some reason but i think its awful.All of these 4 stars go to never never,amazing song."
5,DIFFERENT ASPECT OF ROMANCE,"This is an excellently written romance - tender and heartwarming.Although Winn Sutton was blinded in an accident with ""Rosie"" I was expecting a bit more passionate denial and a knock on the head to restore his sight.I did like the attitude of Cynthie Franklin and her son Greg in their developing relationship with Winn. I think I was looking for a more agressive approach on her part in taking up the reins of her life on the ranch.And Kyle Dempsey, I could tell he was a worm right off the bat. When they are too good to be true that is usually the case. How could Cynthie believe this dude??I got the feeling from the author that the neighbor, Ott was a creepy person. And I was intrigued with the character, Peter and how he rounded out the story. Louie, now, he was neat!Widow or not, did she have to crawl in bed with Winn?? He seemed honest and honorable but he had issues. And she had troubles.Altogether a very readable, good story.Will recommend --M and pass on."
4,Some Great Songs,"There are some great songs on these cds, many of which I had never heard before. It sounds like it was made from vinyl though, there are pops and cracks, which sort of distract, now that I am not used to hearing those anymore. It's definately worth buying."
4,Nice B-Side Box Set for Cure fans,"Finally, Cure fans will be able to listen to great songs in good audio quality. For Cure fans there is nothing new, and maybe there are some songs missing, replaced by some non-sense songs like the 10 seconds long version of The Doors cover 'Hello I Love You' (there are 3 versions of that song).The opinions about many of the remixes are personal for each fan, but is good to see songs like Burn (from The Crow movie soundtrack), the b-sides from the Wish album (altough the Lost Wishes, 4 instrumental songs, are missing), and some covers like Hendrix's 'Purple Haze', Depeche Mode's 'World In My Eyes' or Bowie's 'Young Americans'.Overall, a nice set for Cure fans with ups and downs in more than 300 minutes of Cure music..."
2,join the dots?,Out of the 4 cd's i managed to make 1 complete mixed cd that is worth listening. The first 2 cd's i didn't really care for. The next 2 have got some real gems on them and i mean real GEMS!The one thing that really put me off about this set is a lot of the songs are recorded with one of those 25 dollar used beat boxes. Real drums are so much better!Guess I was expecting more!
1,The Yugo of Snow Tubes,"The first time I used this tube, it got a small hole on the seam. I was able to fix it. The second time I used the tube, it split a crack about two inches long. Because of the cold, the material became brittle, causing the crack. The temperature was about 10 F, not an unreasonable temperature for sledding, I would think. This tube stinks. Enron stock is worth more than this thing."
2,Broken Down,"I read the reviews that told me these snow tubes don't last, but I tried anyway. It's true, they don't last long. I have three boys 10 and under who put them to the test. One sprung a leak, unable to sustain rougher sledding. If you have a child who is not rough (jumping on after running for speed) this tube might work. I don't recommend it for active kids."
3,What a helpful book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book, and learned quite a lot about myself, and how to deal with my pain. I learned that things I did in my daily activities were efects of the child abuse, which I would have never guessed. I also learned how to deal with my guilt, and where it was all coming from. Since this book is a guide to parents, teachers, and councelors, it really helped to also see there perspective of things, and it helped me figure out how to deal with my struggles, based upon the advice given to them, in order to help people like us. I recomend this book to not only the teachers, parents, and councelors, but also to the abused. It helps more than you could ever imagine!"
3,Not bad... a few notes,"The photo shown is a Supra, the one that arrived is a Kidde brand. I searched the web high and low and found no connection between GE/Kidde. Just FYI. Then, we installed it this weekend, and it's fairly heavy duty. The key pad buttons are more flimsy than I would have thought; and, they press down together. For example, 1 and 6 are side by side. If you put 1 in your code, when you punch in your code, the 6 will also move in a downward direction. Also, it comes with this round hook to attach your keys to, which attached at the top of the key pad part (inside the box). But, this made getting the keys in the box and shutting more tricky. I opted for the cover that goes over this given where we live. It's a great, snug fit. Overall, happy enough with the purchase."
5,perfect,Very heavy duty and easy to install. Also bought rubber cover to conceal fact it was key safe. Mom feels safe now for EMT entrance
5,"Great, heavy duty product","I came across this product while on holidays. When we came back we purchased 2, one for us and the other as a gift. It is the perfect solution for anyone who tends to forget things, particulary keys! This keysafe is a cheaper option than trying to repair the damaged caused by trying to break into your home. Would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to store keys outside."
3,"Great content, but needs better art","The content about the holidays is great, but the computer drawings are a bit primitive. Not because of a lack of talent or effort, but they look like they were done in MS Paint."
1,terrible pictures,I just got this book and flipped through it. The illustrations look like bad computer art - pixelated. I wish I could return it. The text seems well written.
1,disappointed,"I was saddened to discover this book is a poor tool for information on the extremly important subject matter. I will not keep this book as it would have to ad lib through much of the content to make up for lack of information and misleading words. I am unable to regift it as I do not endorse the book.An example of incorrect infomation- The African flag is described to explain the colors of the candles used in celebrating Kwanza. There is no African flag....there are flags of the African countries and each has it's own color scheme.Yule is written in past tense as if this holiday is no longer celebrated. The name used to describe the people, Pagan, is not defined.Winter Solstice is used again and again but never explained as a holiday of Light but as a way to describe Yule.I am now suspect of all of the other information as misleading. I will not read this book."
5,A Beautiful look at winter celebrations world-wide,"This book is full of wonderful information that is accessible to children and interesting to adults. It provides a respectful description of ten of the many historical and contemporary mid-winter celebrations of the world and highlights their commonality. The text and illustrations are beautiful. I sent it to be read to my seven year-old's Girl Scout troop, where the children were enthralled by it. My daughter was delighted when she learned afterwards that we had a copy at home."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book. While it manages to name most of the winter holidays and many different cultures, it contains grammatical errors and factual errors. The illustrations are horrendous. They are horribly pixilated computer-generated illustrations that lack any beauty or grace. If you can edit on the fly while reading, this may be one to borrow from the library as a very first introduction to the many winter holidays."
2,Wrong track listing!,"There are only 5 tracks, not 6. Get the Party Started/Sweet Dreams is one track. Don't buy this if you're expecting a stand-alone cover."
1,Another LONG-WINDED book.,This book is filled with copious repetition (see chapter one alone). Some concepts are not well presented. Explanations are too often compromised by awkward English usage. Wish the authors understand that a thick book does not make it a good one. Concise books are just what we need today.
2,I don't like this book,"I agree with other reviewer, many cross references in the book, it makes extremely hard to read the material.English is not native for me, I have very hard time understanding the text. I have no problems with other technical books in general.I need more answers to exercises, no way to test you knowledge."
2,Not good.,This book is atleast 500 pages longer than it needed to be. It uses all to many words when presenting the information.
4,"Good information, but disorganized Exercises","This book has good information, and is fairly well organized. I like the examples in every section of the chapter.However, a lot of the Exercises are not very well presented. For example, one exercise section had about 5 exercises. Exercise 2 references 1. 3 references 1. 4 references 2. 4 references 1. 5 reference 4 AND 2. When I was doing exercise 5 it took me 15 minutes to figure out just what it was asking, and I'm still not sure that I got it right. I've never seen any other book chain reference like that before. In my opinion, referencing should make you look at no more than one other contiguous and non-further-referencing block of information."
5,Very nice book if used as a textbook,Very nice writen for new learners while covers enough aspects to step further. Long because it is from the merging of another 2 books. Recommended as a handbook for new commers to database area.
1,Poorly written,"I was extremely disappointed by this book (I borrowed it, thank God). It is sparse on several subjects, exercises lacks answers and the book is in general poorly written. Besides that, the book is a merge of two books and the integration of these books should never have been attempted.You may go to the book's home page and download a couple of chapters for free and decide for yourself.Sorry, I cannot possibly recommend this book."
1,not a beginner's book,"This book is probably great if you are already an expert. Topics are presented very briefly with poor examples. Only a very small number of the questions have solutions, none of which are in the book. They are only available on the author's web site and some of them are wrong. The author really doesn't present his algorithms in a stepwise bulleted manner, even though most of them are well suited to that type of display. He chooses instead to bury algorithms in blocks of text, which makes it very difficult to use this book as a reference for assignments. His terminology is also very unclear. Unless you are already an expert, you will find yourself rereading sections four and five times before realizing that they are just plain inscrutable without some large body of prior knowledge. If you have a deep appreciation for obfuscation, or did your Phd work on databases, you'll probably love this book."
1,Useless book,This book is very difficult to read and poorly written. I was looking forward to reading this book because of the reputation of the authors. They have done a sloppy job with this book and I was extremely disappointed.
2,Comprehensive in topics but not coverage,"This book has plenty of topics. It just covers them too lightly. I used this book for a graduate course in Database Systems as one of the primary texts and found it to be lacking a number of details. This is not my first database class and luckily I still had other texts from those previous classes. If not for that I'd have been toast. If you have to use this book, plan on buying/borrowing secondary references."
3,"Content is excellent, but presentation could use an update; be more visual.","An excellent book on database systems, keyed for the beginner/novice. Some familiarity with databases and files is nice to have, but could be used as a first course book. The authors are all noted in their area, and the content is great...better than great, excellent. However, the overall presentation of the material -- the graphics and visuals -- are not nearly as well done as is possible (and standard) for today's top text books. More and better use of color, more case studies, and just in general better graphics/visuals would make this a much more effective (and fun) book. And that's the reason for the average rating...it's just average in its presentation and therefore its effectiveness as a text."
4,Comprehensive and Easy Reading,"You cannot go wrong with Hector Garcia-Molina, the author with highest h-index in computer science and Ullman. This book is an easy reading, something uncommon for the books of this genre. It covers a wide variety of topics from relational algebra to E/R modeling, data mining algorithms and SQL; makes a wonderful textbook for graduate studies."
1,Poorly explained and badly written,"This book was assigned for a class I am taking. It is poorly written. The algorithms are not explained clearly and have important details missing. To be fair, I am not sure how this book reads to someone who is already familiar with databases, but as learning material it is absolutely terrible. I do not recommend it at all."
3,single license only,"This is not a review of this book content. I just would like to warn other potential buyers that Kindle edition is a single license. I got used to having all other books available across my computers, a tablet, a kindle and a iphone (very handy while waiting in car, doctors office etc.). Being spoiled this way this restriction feels like a significant nuisance. I wish there was some indication of this limitation in a product description."
5,The Ashtanga Yoga Collection,This is an excellent collection video set by Richard Freeman for your home library. The step-by-step in dept instruction is easy to follow for any beginner or advance student. If you are interested in learning Ashtanga yoga this collection is the one you need to have. I give it five (5) stars!
4,Stay with it!,"As the other reviewer said, the source of this recording is a series of old acetates some of which are in pretty bad condition. That said, the historical value of this recording cannot be over-emphasized.First of all, it is one of the rare opportunities to hear the great baritone Giuseppe De Luca in a complete role. His voice at 59 may be a bit heavy for the role of the young Mercutio but he knows how to handle his instrument.Fifty-one year old Eide Norena also makes an amazing Juliette, her fioratura is right in place and she is sweet and convincing.Charles Hackett is also stronger and more dramatic than most proponents of the role of Romeo and he tends to become somewhat dramatic but it is, afterall, a live performance.Leon Rothier's Frere Laurent is a powerhouse.Louis Hasselmann's conducting keeps the music moving.Yes, the sound is not pristine but it is never less than listenable and is worth having for its historical value."
4,Best Powerhead for the money...,"I got this powerhead and it came with a propeller as well as an impeller so you could switch how it circulates. While I have only bought Maxi-jets for years and would not recommend another powerhead, I do not recommend using the propeller in place of the impeller. BIG mistake. I must have spent hours with my hands in salt water trying to get the propeller to work. Every time I thought it might keep working, the propeller would quit and I was back washing up and fixing propellers again. I gave up after several weeks of on again off again trying and they are working fine as powerheads with impellers, and it is finally quiet again (when the propellers worked they were never quiet)."
4,Maxi-jet 400,"I'm familiar with maxi-jet powerheads and they are extremely reliable and long lasting. However, upon arrival the magnetic driven rod and magnetic were damaged rendering it useless."
5,Awesome Book!,I recommend this book for anyone coming out of a relationship you regret having been in. It is also good for anyone who wants to know what a healthy relationship should look like prior to getting into that relationship.
3,Fine but don't believe the hype,"This dvd is easy to follow and quite effective, but not as original and outstanding in its effectiveness as other reviews would have you believe; I am sure there are plenty of other similar products on the market. Furthermore, anyone that works out regularly is unlikely to find anything to boost them to 'the next level' here."
2,overhyped,"Katie Skow is the creator of Pompilates, so I guess it is fitting that she gives herself a 5-star review on May 9th, 2007. However, many of these previous reviewers have given both Katie's product (Pompilates) and her husband's book (Gracias Africa by Ricardo Villarreal) 5-star reviews with little or no other reviews to their name.I have to agree with K. Robinson's review on September 5th, 2009 that states the reviews here for Pompilates are overhyped."
1,Skip this one,This is probably the worst workout I have ever bought. The music is wierd and the exercises are similar to any other strength training workout that you could buy. The copy that I was shipped was also in Spanish. I would skip this one and save your money.
5,Just what I needed,"I was looking for a good, quick workout in the morning. This video is 15 minutes long. No more excuses about not having enough time in the morning!"
1,"One of the worst - look good, but not durable","I have 5 Samsonite suitcases, and most of them are good.However, I used this suitcase 2 times and the cushion rubber fell off. I went to Samsonite repair center in Atlanta. They refused to fix the problem and basically said if the product looks fine out of the box, you're on your own.I did not know Samsonite 10 years warranty does not mean a thing."
1,Broke after first flight,Nice size and weight but not reliable. Mine broke (attachment point for handle) after first flight. Its pain to get fixed as Samsonite will not send replacement parts but instead you have to ship to a repair center.
5,Best Choice!,"I was looking for a book for couples to enjoy on their honeymoon, anniversary or just a romantic weekend together! I put them in kits I made for my customers and they LOVED them! I took one of the books and read the entire thing right away! It is sexy, informative, instructive and perfect for tucking away in a discrete place! I love the look, size and style of this book. As my need for more kits come about I will order another case!"
2,What to call it?,"Quick read, and easy, but leaves much to be desired. The full version with photos is much better, and the descriptions are more explicit and easier to understand."
4,Book,"I got this as a ""gag"" gift for my sister. It was part of an inside joke. Once I explained to her what it was She loved it lol. It's tiny and a great size for your purse. Also has some good tips in it! ;)"
2,MS,"I purchased this game based on a recommendation from one of the games sponsors, Mr.Glenn Beck, but have to say that it did not appeal to the kiddo's (teenagers) at all. Some questions are stupid and some have a sexual context. It will probably sit on the shelf collecting dust."
1,Worse than it sounds. Would have loved to return it.,"Had my son not opened it we would have not known it was so bad. I thought it just was adult themes not NASTY, Dirty and Sickening. Don't buy, we'll probably burn it. Too bad it was so expensive. My mistake for buying it."
2,Great premise but game drags,"We bought my 13 y.o. son the tamer version of this game. The questions are fantastic and fascinating, that's true. But the game play stops cold every few seconds as you refer to the directions or read paragraphs aloud (the directions tell you to do so). If I had it to do again, I'd save my money and buy the Zobmondo Would You Rather books - - the questions are the fascinating part of this, not the game, which drags."
3,"Twisted, Sick and Wrong?","While some of the questions in the game do indeed live up to the name, most are innocuous and rather tame providing for no moral dilemma. In this I was disappointed. The game is fun to play, however, and a good conversation starter. I give it three stars."
3,Board game,"Bought this game for my sister for Christmas...sort of difficult to play. The directions are ambigious. Although reading the cards are fun, the game takes a while to learn how to play."
3,Like a boring game of truth or dare...,"Like any ""adult"" game, this leaves a lot to be desired. The cost of liquor to make this game fun makes it a bad investment."
5,Hilarious!,"Great game and very entertaining!! Fun topics for discussion and just plain hilarious! It definitely is the twisted, sick and wrong version, which made the game even better. Everyone who participated was in the 28+ age group. Sometimes we did pass on the challenge cards due to the questions/activities. The game produced lots of laughs and a great game night!"
1,Just plain awful!,"Unless you are immature AND drunk, do not buy this game! Our family gets together several times a year to play games and my mom bought this new game to try. We didn't even get passed the first person's turn before all agreed to abandoned it! We went back to an old stand by...Apples to Apples. Do yourself a huge favor and ignore any reviews that suggest this is a good game!!! There were 8 of us and we all hated it!!!"
2,not very fun nor twisted or sick,me and the husband and some friends tried playing the game everyone had about 3 turns and we got so bored so we shifted through the cards and nothing seemed twisted or sick it was just plain boring questions. and we are normally simply amused not at all with this game! think we might gift it to someone else :P
4,Not for young children,"I bought this for a family gathering atThanksgiving. We had a lot of fun, but some of the questions are not appropriate for young children so we had to skip these when children were in the room."
2,OK but save your money,This game looks like it would be interesting but after a couple games it gets a little boring. Some of the questions are not as sick and twisted as you would think. It would be worth the money if it cost under $15.00. My advise save your money.
2,"Good concept, but poorly implemented","The supplied ""Would You Rather..."" questions are fun and entertaining, but the ""challenges"" are inane. They happen far too often, are far too complex, and some are sophomoric. Just ignore the challenge cards, and use the board to race to the center."
2,cd cases,"Cases were as expected. However, they did not contain the labels to write song title. Very Disappointing"
4,A Reporter's Life,The book was apparently stored incorrectly because the back cover jutted out more than the front cover (had an underbite). And a section of several pages in the middle of the book came loose from the binding. But the price was more than low enough to make up for these.
3,Nothing new,"I enjoyed the book. But I felt the book lacked any new insights into all of the history this author lived through. While the book gave some interesting background on the author's family, the rest of it was like watching reruns of the 6:30 news.It left me wanting more of what wasn't there."
4,Starts slow but picks up,His personal story blends well with historical events. Sort of a very readable history book as well as a memoir.
3,Very Disappointing,"I really expected to enjoy this book but I gave up after a little more than half way through. I was suprised that Cronkite could take some of the 20th century's most important events and make them seem dull and lifeless. Sorry, Uncle Walter, that's not the way it was!!"
2,You'd think the guy could write,"This is a surprisingly bad book, written essentially as a string of anecdotes on interesting things that happened to Walter Cronkite in his years as a newsman. For a guy who used to complain that a half-hour newscast wasn't long enough to adequately convey news, it's disappointing to see so many interesting moments in time (Walter's role in covering the Apollo 11 moon landing is a good example) get such short shrift.This book reads like it was dictated into a tape recorder. There's a continual ""then there was the time I..."" approach to introducing the various anecodtes, and while I suppose a straight chronological approach might not have worked, it's jarring to read about LBJ's reaction to the Kennedy assassination several chapters BEFORE Cronkite recalls the assassination itself.It'll be up to someone else to do the definitive Cronkite biography."
2,Cronkite Got Into Everything...,"Had I read this when I was taking journalism classes in secondary school, I probably would've pursued that career instead of what I chose. (Probably a good thing I didn't, since I wouldn't want to be part of the mainstream media today...) It's incredible to see what one man was able to do, and be involved with, in his life. However, as interesting as some of his life stories are, this rambling book makes you work to figure them out. It wanders back and forth through the decades in a frustrating manner. There are some interesting anecdotes, to be sure, but the book could use some thorough editing."
4,WALTER CRONKITE: A REPORTER'S LIFE,WALTER CRONKITE'S VALUES AND INTEGRITY MADE HIM ONE OF THE GREATEST REPORTERS OF ALL TIME. A MUST READ. THE EMOTIONS HE INVOKE IN HIS MEMOIR CAUSE THE READER FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE LIVING IN THE MOMENT HE IS RELATING.
2,A pompous and shallow epistle,"Cronkite was in his youth a fine reporter. In the days of WWII, he was a courageous man who flew bombing missions,risking his life with the soldiers of the AAF. In the early days of TV news he helped define the style of TV news. But in the years hence he has become yet another pompous, self-important hack. His criticisms are shallow, and his ego inflated. For a far better book about a far more interesting character, read David Brinkly's autobiography"
4,"Interesting, Irrelevant, Depressing","Walter Cronkites' book ""A Reporters Life"" is interesting, irrelevant and ultimately depressing. His behind the scenes view of some of the most important events of this decade where interesting and exciting. Wannabe journalists beware, you may get caught up in the excitement of by gone days and start reconsidering that career change. The book goes off track when Mr. Cronkites turns from journalist to OP-Ed writer. Mr. Cronkite offers up personal opinion as if he is reporting history. Ultimately the book is depressing in its view of the current state of journalism, depressing because of the truth in his words. Thanks Mr. Cronkite for telling us the ""way it was"""
2,I was disappointed Cronkite wasn't more interesting.,"I would have thought that with all the interesting events that Mr. Cronkite observed first-hand, he would have had more interesting stories to tell. Most of his stories of his early radio days were almost cliches (e.g., how we made up sports descriptions from teletype wire copy.) And his insights into the big events are so broad in scope that they are almost trite. Oh, there are some interesting nuggets to be mined, but I was hoping for a more interesting collection of anecdotes and behind the scenes information from such a global observer."
2,"If ""You Were There,"" you'd have been disappointed.","The first third or so of the book was quite interesting. The pages describing Walter's young life in newspaper work, the early days of radio and TV news, and his WWII reporting flew by. After the WWII part he changed from a chronological narrative. It's not really clear what type of narrative it became -- not exactly philosophical, but he jumped from one subject to another, and one decade to another. He also came across as defensive in explaining many of his actions and controversial positions. I often felt as though I were being lectured. I loved ""You Were There"" as a kid in the early 1970s, but I don't remember much about Walter as an anchorman. Overall, I was intrigued at the beginning, but disappointed with the rest."
3,Had to be there,"I'm a little more than half way through this book. I'm 18 years old, so I never got to see Mr. Cronkite in action. I have seen him on a clip of the movie Apollo 13 and on the Oprah Winfrey show. I have always been interested in the history of the 20th century. Mr. Cronkite was there to view most of the events that shaped the U.S. This is the main reason that I picked up the book.When I starte reading, I noticed that the author writes more as a journalist than he does as an author. The book is am extremely long newspaper. I recomend this book for anyone over thirty.The reason I gave this book a 3 star is because it lacks suspense and drama. Its not a novel, its a long newspaper."
4,"Cronkite's bio is interesting, humurous and inspiring.",I thought Cronkite did a really good job describing his life and the many historical events happening around it. It wasn't monotone or pompous but true to life and at times funny.
3,To this day I don't know if it works,"I've calibrated it as per the instructions, and when I put the tips into water I get an appropriate reading, but I've never seen anything other than 0.00% on any building material I've tried to test. Just not sure, so I can't recommend this item."
1,"POOR DESIGN, cheap junk","WOW, I am stunned by the ridiculous design of this toy! you cannot push the pins into wood without the flip-out probes un-locking and snapping back in and stabbing YOU!Who designed this piece of junk!Most of the time the readings are all over the map, no consistent reading on anything! Moisture scale is ""Relative"" which means GOOD LUCK trying to figure out what the heck the actual moisture content is without the full instructions with you!"
1,Didn't work for me,"My puppy's tear stains weren't that bad, but this didn't work on him. You must have to really scrub like mad with this product and I just used the brush that it came with and held the dog down and brushed many times. I saw no improvement. I used Angel's Eyes the same day and the tearing stopped within a couple of days. I wouldn't waste my money again, just get the angel's eyes and cut the stained fur when it has grown out some."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY! DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!,"I have been using this product on my dog for 3 weeks. There is NO CHANGE whatsoever! She STILL has the tear stains on her fur! Also, the solution has the tendency to turn very watery - not a gel at all! It was a gel when I first opened it, now, it's a liquid. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,DOESNT WORK.. ITS A WASTE,THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF MONEY... DONT WASTE UR TIME OR MONEY ..RUNNN SAVE URSELF.. the shipping was fast. but the product just didnt work
2,"Used it once, replaced it","This lamp is not good enough to meet standards for daily use or for anyone who uses a notebook full of sheet music on a standard stand. The clamp is definitely cheap quality. The weight of the lamp head moves the light downward no matter how tightly you cinch the nut/bolt assemply.The light socket is poor quality and jiggles a bit if the stand is nudged or moves with the action nearby. It's a cheap price, but also a cheap lamp. Replaced it immediately and put this one in the workshop, where I find it just as inadequate."
4,Best light I've ever found,"Excellent lighting of all the sheet music. Love the fact that it plugs into the wall (I use zip-ties to keep the chord out of the way). I will change the clamp out with an industrial strength woodworking clamp, but that is a preference, not a necessity."
5,True Mountain Man,"This book about Old Bill Williams gives us an insight to the mountain man, basically a hunter and trapper.If you are interested in early U.S. history, especially of the West, this book is a must."
5,Excellent Northern Michigan Mystery,"The second Mitch Mitchell mystery is every bit as good as the first with very atmospheric Northern Michigan settings, a Ross MacDonald-style plot about greed and depravity in a rich family, and a tough, appealing female detective who is free of the Chandleresque pretentions of Sara Paretsky types.Great stuff, great series."
5,Album of hidden gems,"Tired of listening to albums that sound all sound the same?Ready for something that is timelessly different that covers a range of different styles?If so get yourself a copy of this LP and fire up the old record player for ""Shaking the Tree [yes its true] 12 golden greats""."
1,maxi-jet,Product was defective. Parts did not fit properly. I feel the wrong part went to a smaller power head. The company replaced the powerhead but opened the package for the new powerhead and swapped out for the same part. I have 4 of these same powerheads so I know how they are packaged and how the parts fit. Woman from company wanted me to go to a hardware store and buy Pipe tape and repair it myself. I refused because I should not have to repair a new product. Problem not resolved. Will not purchase product again
3,"Nice illustrations, but...","The pictures are delightful, but the story and prose are weak. There is too much going on -- a mother cat with kittens, the ballet, the mean stage manager, Degas, the ballet dancers and teacher --eek. The writing style is also passive, I assume to contibute to a sense of impressionistic and dreamy haze, but what it seems like is a shmaltzy and often wooden translation into English from some other language. I wouldn't reccommend this book if you or your child are particularly sensitive to well-written prose. (I know I'm opening up my review for criticism with that statement, but so be it! ;) )"
5,COOL BOOK ON THE WWF SUPERSTARS,THIS IS A BRIILIANT BOOK RECOMEND GOE BUY IT IT IS COOL 7AGW1@PENAIR.CORNWALL.SCH.UK BUY THE BOOK OF ME FOR 1 E MAIL OR PHONE 01872 273138
2,Great potential but poor execution,"I am a big ATB fan and all his previous stuff was great. This CD could have been amazing, but quite frankly, the WAY-overused female vocals messed the whole thing up. This truly is the only thing I am complaining about on this album but it is an EXTREME flaw. This music is not trance anymore, it is regular-sung songs with an occasion tranced out instrumental here and there. ATB should seriously think about quitting if this is the kind of material he will keep releasing in the future. Do NOT buy this CD if you expect TRANCE."
5,ATB - A must buy,"Alright first things first ... i havn't bought the cd yetBUT one thing from what i have learned from the past ATB is on their 4th album ... the first 3 luved them ... the 4th i know i will love ... you can't not go wrong with these trance dj's .. like ATB, tiesto, paul van dak, sasha, oakenfold, dyweed ... and the list goes on .. so for all u mainstearm JOEY dance lovers if u are disappointed ... you need to take another listen"
2,Sadly Disappointing,"I bought this CD hoping to get something similar to the only track i'd heard from it, ""long way home."" unfortunately, i got a CD that was way too overloaded with hollow, monotonous vocals and way too downbeat for casual listening. perhaps atb simply isn't my style any more, or perhaps this cd could have been a lot better (probably both). i give it two stars because of the remix-ability of many of the tracks on here. perhaps some more qualified artists will take it upon themselves to put some energy and enthusiasm into these songs. sadly, i wasted my money on a cd i will probably never listen to in a month."
2,Slow but pleasing,"I'm more used to a more rhythmic tempo from ATB. This wasn't what I had in mind when I was buying the cd. All tracks are rather slow and melancholy. Not rapid up beat melodies and songs at all. It's good to relax with I guess. If you like a slow, more mesmerizing kind of tunes then this is for you. Otherwise don't bother."
4,I'm a huge ATB fan,I love most of his music. This cd is great but the only thing that dissappointed me is that the 2nd cd is a cdrom. I wish it was a dvd so I could have used my big screen tv and stereo to truly enjoy it.
1,Choose a different book,"For the average layman I would suggest a different book. I can't recommend anyone else yet because I need to start over and find a decent book that can show me the cultural differences between the Hebrews and Greeks. This writer addressed his book to other professionals in this field who obviously would recognize his references. This author continually referenced authors by name throughout the book and if they are as boring as he was then I'll never know what they wrote about.This is a very boring book to read and I wouldn't suggest anyone pay retail for it. If you can find it in a thrift store for about a dollar, then maybe. You wouldn't feel so guilty when you throw it away."
5,from Sharon,"Being a novice, I love lemoyne stars, but haven't yet tackled diamonds and ""y"" seams... I love Nancy's books anyway, so decided to try this....using Nancy's technique making stars is incredibly easy!!..your points are perfect and there are very few seams to be matched...I am thrilled with this book, and I'm just pumping out wonderful stars... thanks, Nancy"
5,Awsome RPG,"This game takes RPG to the next level. Even though it's rated T, it has Bood and Gore. This is the only T rated game I've ever seen that has so much Blood. you take on the role of Chef Uzaki (a.k.a. Shona or something like that), and battle the Gnosis alongside KOS-MOS, a... robot thing, created by whatever company thing made her (I think it's called Ephilar, or something like that). Did I mention that, while all this is happening, you're in the year 4000 something? well, that's all I can tell you, I've only been playing for a half an hour."
5,Best RPG -EVER-,"This is by far the best RPG game so far. I've played the Japanese version, and it is the best game. I only hope that the US dub is good. I would much rather have the game in Japanese/Subbed, but who knows how Namco will release it. No matter what the release is buy this game."
3,"Great, but not for everyone.","This game is good. It has an excellent story-line, great graphics, and an innovative battle system, but it is extremely difficult. It took me months to beat it, and I honestly can't recommend it. There was too much involved in beating it to really make me say it was worth it."
4,Play a game or watch it?,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game, and am waiting for the sequel. But you spend almost as much time watching the cutscenes as playing the game. And the storyline can be a bit confusing. Still, when you do actually play, it's fun. And the Story and Characters are quite good.If you're an hardcore RPG fan, you'll want this game."
4,The Complete XS Review,"Xenosaga is dramatic, intriguing, and deep in the scope of its storyline.To tell you too much could spoil perhaps the greatest plot ever included in any video game to date. What I can say is that it's set in the distant future, when mankind lives only in deep space. It mixes science fiction and fantasy elements into a mix that rivals even the greatest anime series.It is presented alongside a sweeping soundtrack, outstanding graphics, and dramatic cinema scenes. The characters really shine during these; you'll think it's actually a CG anime rather than a game's real-time graphics.Quite simply, Xenosaga is an experience not to be missed. As one of the most polished and complete games ever, every facet of it speaks of undeniable quality. All of its excellent qualities come together magnificently to form a moving experience that you will enjoy the whole way through. With over 50 hours of some of the best gameplay ever created, the investment would certainly be well worth it."
5,Great game for great fun,"This one of the few games that are a must have on the PS2. Everything is just fine in it : scenario, realisation and gameplay."
4,Warning,"Xenosaga is indeed great as any other of the commentaries might say. However, be warned playstation 2 first generation users for the game has a bug that usually makes the game freeze at certain parts of the game. Also, due to technical difficulties, Xenosaga takes a very long time to load some stages and specially the mini games. Be warned before buying this game. Namco hasn't still anounced yet if they will release a bug free Xenosaga and because of that, I would recomend to wait a little before buying it."
5,A Solid Classic Game,"Xenosaga is one of the most underrated RPGs on the PS2. While the cutscenes can get kind of long, it make syou feel like you're watching a movie. Simply put, that's what this is, a playable movie. It has simple controls, but that doesn't mean that no strategy is involved. The boss battles can get intense, and the plot only gets thicker. If you have money, you should buy this game. It is guaranteed to entertain your gamer side and your intellectual side."
5,Why are you reading? Buy it now!,"Okay, read this if your not sure.....There`s `bout 80 hours of it, almost half cutseens (Trust me thats a very good thing with its A+ storyline and perfect graphics) the rest game play which is good too. The fights work like this: there is a gage that shows you who (or what) is going next. There is some action called 'BOOST' which, if you can at the time, lets you cut in front of the next person`s turn, giving you another turn. You attack useing combos (about7) use magic or suit up in your 20 foot tall robot that you can equip a weapon of a large, some times small, selection. I played 6 hours and theres about 1 magic move for each person so far though............Graphics-5/5Sound-4/5Gameplay-5/5Control-4/5"
4,Must buy game,"While this game is a great buy, and i do recommend it, the only thing i find wrong with it, is the long load times between scenes. If they had made it flow together better, it would have been one of the best out there. But as it stands, it is still one of the top games out there."
3,Darn my eyes why don't I like this game?,"This game has all the elements that a rpg/mecha/ anime lover would want but for some reason I just could not get in to it. I bought 1&2 but while the cut scenes were pretty , the mecha battling cool I found myself bored stiff by the story line.I am so sorry I feel like I am betraying rpg'ers and anime fans everywhere..I actually did not get through the game. I set it down and started playing something else and that was like 8 years ago or something and I have still not played it or the second one .Shame on me! I will get to it though..soon..."
5,Xenosaga Review,"This game is madd hott!! If you love rpg games this is the game for you. The graphics is realli hott, the story line is good but the onli thin that is bad is the fact that the cinamatic movies r too long nd they get kinda annoyin sumtimes but besides that its realli good!!"
4,Most excellent game if you don't mind the long cinemas,"This is one addicting game. Yes it is 50+ hours if you take the time to collect all the items (which you will want do to for use with the second game). The graphics are cool but the dubbing was like and old kung-fu flick if you know what I mean. The building of characters is a tedious process and be be very slow. First you need to gain skill points and such. Skill points aren't gained as fast as the sphere system in FFX. It takes a while, but worth the wait. The combo battle system is a great thing to have along with the techattacks. I wish there was more battle anamation like in the FF series during a summon. The controls are very easy to learn and take no time at all. One of the biggest disapointing aspects of this game is crate busting. You run around and bust crates to get more items. Yeah...busting crates, crates, and more crates. As Adam Sessler of tech tv's Extended Play states: If your a fan of crate busting, this is the game for you."
2,VIDEOGAME?????,"I have played Xenogears for exactly 2 hours and 30 minutes now, and I have fought a wopping 5 random battles that arent worth my time and have had about 10 minutes actually playing the game. The other 2 hours and some odd minutes are freaking cut scenes that arent even good enough to get my attention. The game is not bad though, but DEFINITELY NOT A FINAL FANTASTY OR HIGH LEVEL RPG. Its just a plain run of the mill rpg, so dont expect anything."
2,hmmmmm im not quite sure,"Anybody who plays this and has never played xenogears it's a lot better. unfourtionitly i played xenogears first and it's just not up to fei and elly's standards. First of all it's extremely short, also it's characters are sub-par, and 1 huge problem is it's missing something very important...a love story. Sure there is the creepy relationship between Jr and Momo, but that's just not good enough. If you already played Xenogears please dont compare them that totally will ruin it. fei is would be spinning his grave (if he was dead..hehe)."
4,Haven't seen it all yet!,"I'm enjoying the game, it was in perfect condition when I received it. I haven't had the chance to play as much as I'd like, but I will!"
1,Seriously....wtf?,"Ok....a cutscene here and there, ok........a cutscene every freakin time you move, that goes on for 45 minutes is NOT fun. My save game is clocked at 19 hours, and I'm sure I only played about 3 or 4 of those hours. And when I was playing all I was doing was running around!!!!!!!! How in god's name did you all give this game a 5?? You want a good game that's similart to this, Get shadow hearts (preferably 2) it's a THOUSAND times better. After playing that, you'll wonder how the hell you EVER gave this 5 stars, therefore convincing me to buy this AWFUL game.I had more fun playing the Xenocard game than I did with the rest of it. And even that I got bored with."
3,Not as good as everyone says,"This game was pretty good, but it falls a mile short of the Final Fantasy games. You wanna buy a good game, buy Final Fantasy X. The graphics in Xenosaga are good, better then most. They have good voice overs. The plot is kind of boring though. The battle systems are also a bit lacking and they are pretty difficult to get at first too. If you like to think, you should definatly buy this game. But if you have played the Final Fantasy games dont bother, you will be very disapointed."
1,Horrible Purchase,"I hate this game. Waste of money. I can't believe NAMCO would put out such a horrible game. Probably the worst RPG ever!!! What is up with the ...robots in the battle out of no where? And the bunny? Stupid. The plot line was horrible, and the game took way to long. I felt like killing myself. The characters reminded me of drugged-up hippies. Done. Remember kids, play poke the bunny"
3,So so,"This game has it's good points; good animation, music, decent characters, original story line.On the other hand, the plot is insanely complicated, and the voice acting is kind of silly. The boss fights aren't very hard, but there are many annoying little battles in each level. It must be reiterated, the cut scenes are very long and very boring. Therefore, what little time you actually spend in control isn't much fun anyway.On a lesser note, the story is pretty dark. Which could be good or bad depending on what you like.I don't think this is a bad game despite it's flaws. Don't expect a masterpiece, but it's entertaining enough to fill a weekend when you don't have much else to do."
3,Great Short Story,"i'll sum it up quickly. this game has the best graphics i've seen to date. it has one of the most solid battle systems i have ever beheld. the music is a great addition. the voice acting while not the best in the world is better than most games. so why three stars? one main reason, really. one is false advertising. the back of the package clearly says 'an epic adventure delivering over 80 hours of game play' this is a flat out lie. i beat it in 40 and that counts cinemas. there were even some items you couldn't hope to buy by the end of the game, it seems like insted of putting the entire game IN one game, they cut it up and are going to put it out in different games to make more money. this game will end when you least suspect it because... well.... almost no questions are answered at all. still, if you plan on shelling out the cash to take part in the epic six chapter xeno story, this game is a must."
3,An O.K. Game,"When I got this game, I thought ""Oh great, another R.P.G."" When I played it though, it was fun; as far as the battle system goes. The problem is that there are too many winding hall ways, and what not. Also you may get stuck at the begining of the game due to a big fat boss! So take my word for this, buy the strategy guide!"
3,Not Bad But Certainly Not Great,"Xenosaga.... how you broke my heart....I picked up this game expecting really great things and I was quite disappointed by the time I finished this game.PROS:-Great Graphics-Great Sound-Interesting Story-EXTREMELY good bad-guy (Albido)CONS:-SLOOOOOWWWW Pace-AGWS (Anti Gnosis Weapon System robots) look crappy-Sub-par Characters (except KOS-MOS, she rocks)-Music is too bland and repetitive-Who designed the enemies is this game? The Gnosis sucked....I LOVE the Final Fantasy series (FF7 IS the best game EVER) and I seem to compare every RPG to that series, which is probably a little unfair. However, that's how it is and in my humble opinion, Xenosaga is just not in the same league.Great game for you big Sci-Fi fans but if you're like me and are waiting for the next Final Fantasy 7, look elsewhere."
4,I was waiting for it,"ok, there it is :) A long wait but it was worth it. What a game. The story is very interesting but takes a little bit of time to start. The cut scenes are great and one good point, you can skip them.The graphics are amazing, very detailed. The combat system is really easy to understand and I really enjoy the combos system.so, if you are looking for a great adventure game after FFX, this is the game you need.have fun"
3,its good,it is very boring in the begining but it does pick up pace. if you are not a patient person like if you like a game like balders gate: dark allience. that game is packed with action. this is somewhat the opposite in the begining if you are a patient person like a harvest moon person then this will be a little more upbeat and well not so repetative. if you are patient get this game. if not...well you can try it but i don't know.
1,Yawn,"it's just a bad ripoff of the final fantasy series. i don't know if it's just me, but i just can't get into this game. maybe it's the storyline that iv'e seen in just about every futuristic japanese anime series or maybe it's the fact that you have to play a valley-girl who can't seem to realize that every man in the game is hitting on her and that just makes me feel stupid because i want to slap her so hard in the face and i can't do anything about it."
5,Awesome in-depth game,This game brings you so in-depth with the story line and into the characters it is unreal! With videos and movies lasting up too 30 min. The graphics are great and is not far a gamer who does not want to sit down and play and get into the story.
4,VERY VERY GOOD GAME,"I absolutely LOVE this game. However, you are FORCED to read the text being displayed on the screen as the characters speak during cutscenes. The cutscenes are fully voiced yet you MUST read the text in the same language as the speech!! That is VERY annoying to me and gives me a headache after a while. Why the programmers forgot this one very simple little thing to turn OFF the subtitles is beyond me. Other than that, the game is AWESOME ;)"
5,"Love it, Hate it, It's still Xeno","We can only hope Namco(somehow) pick's this franchise up again and give's so many people what they so desperately NEED.Even as this game may have been a bit long-winded, those that knew Xeno, knew it for It's story and the power it brought you.Could this game have used work? Yes. However, it is still a great first episode and is STILL better than watching that god-awful graphic overdose bonus cinematic disk that came with the LE version of Episode 2."
4,A reliable favorite,"These powerheads have been around forever, and for good reason. They are reliable and quiet. I use them to power undergravel filters."
3,Good Power.,"Wow, very powerful. I was worried that the two I purchased would not be enough for my 30 gallon tank, but I was wrong. They are almost too strong. Even at the lowest aeration setting my tank is completely fill with bubbles. The current is so strong my plants all get pulled and pushed all over. Many different configurations to fit most under gravel lift tubes. Unfortunately, my tubes were not. I had to do some modifying myself."
5,Goulet Reflects,"I bought this LP new in '74 and still own it. Until recently it was the only Goulet I owned which is interesting because it is pretty obscure and doesn't include any of his ""16 Most Requested"" and yet I think it is possibly his BEST work because it contains songs that are not only very substantive, but Goulet is far more nuanced in his approach. These are not ""Belting Broadway"" tunes, but ones in which Goulet interprets life. ""How Little We Know"" is a great example. I've never heard anyone ""cover"" it, but what it says is so true and Goulet's sanquine approach is palpable. I wish this LP would go to CD and find it significant that the used LP is nearly $40.00 -- but if you have a turntable it is worth it. If Goulet is your singer, this is a must to have and hear."
2,1997 Mystery Monsters re-released under a different name,"Go look up Mystery Monsters, a 1997 movie with the same actors, same storyline and even same director. All they did was rename it, tag 2012 to it, and say its a new movie when its an old , and not very good movie. In my opinion."
1,"Pathetic, do not buy ---10 stars",You could write a book just describing the errata and missing instructions for this one. Don't waste your money!
5,Dreamweaver MX: PHP Web Development,Fantastic step by step guide. It would be even better if the chapters did not rely on each other and if there was also a configuration and set up guide for using it on a mac. Overall it has made my life coding php for MySql pages much easier.Thank you
4,Good Book on PHP development,I think this book is a good buy. I sure did open my eyes to a world of development I never thought possible without Dreamweaver. PHP is so powerful and this book let's you harness those great features of PHP.
1,very poor writing,this book is not for beginners ... poor writing and have a lot of nonsence layouts . wasting money to buy ...
3,Errors!,"The book seamed perfect to help me learn PHP and MYSQL using DWMX. Too bad it's so full of errors and mistakes. Remeber trying to learn how to drive a car. Now imagine trying to learn on a car that stalls and breaks down constantly. That's what the book feels like to me. I find myself trouble shooting all the code and that is pretty hard when you are just learning.There is no CD but you can download SOME of the code. Having a final (working) version of the site would have made all the errors stand out a bit more.I am learnig from it, it's just a bit frustrating and slow."
2,Riddled With Errors,"This book is riddled with errors, from nonsense layouts to coding mistakes. The interface (a hotel booking system) is very rudimentary and does not work as advertised.The book does introduce readers to Dreamweaver's server behavior interface and does a good job walking readers through a local install of Apache, MySQL, PHP, and a few other tools.A good idea, poorly executed."
1,BORING!,"Don't waste your time or money. This was a very boring read. I kept wondering when the real story would begin, and got nothing but page after page of meaningless drivel!"
4,Wrong Picture,"Picture showed a class 6 card, description was for a class 2. I could have gotten a class 2 cheaper elswhere, but the card is fine. Great service from Amazon, as usual."
2,Spine Aligner,"The two center rollers on this device are spaced too far apart to effectively massage the muscles closest to the spine. About twenty years ago, I purchased a ""ma roller"" at a shop in Seattle that was the most excellent self-massage device I have ever come across. Unfortunately, I misplaced it. It was of near identical design except that the center rollers were more narrow and more closely spaced. I will sell my new ""Spine Aligner"" at a discount to anyone who is interested and continue my search for the ""ma roller"" of my dreams."
1,Don't bother,"Maybe it's me, but I can't seem to get this aligner to ""work"". When I lay on it was suggested, it actually is so hard that it hurts. Maybe someone else will have better luck."
4,"Wonderful tool for tight back, neck & shoulders","Feeling sore, tight? Have a muscle that is in a spasm? Use this roller---you will get instant relief."
1,too big and could easily cause injury!,"I ordered this and right out of the box, this is clearly much too high (about 2 inches) to use in the prescribed manner. If you lie on the floor and place it between you and the floor you are quite likely to be injured, if not from the device directly from the muscle strain to hold a part of your back so high off the floor, while the rest of your back has no support.The instructions clearly state that this should not be rolled on the back (which is one way I expected to use it) and that lying on top of it is the only acceptable use. I will be returning this item."
3,Wood eye?,"I wish it was made out of maple instead of the pine type wood it is. I'm sure it won't be nearly as durable. Otherwise, the shape and utility is the same."
5,Great!,Exactly what I was looking for. I had one of these in college but lost it while studying abroad. I'm glad I found another! I had been looking for one for years. These things work so well and really help relax my entire body by working just my back.
2,"Good read, but unsatisfying","While a surprisingly engaging descriptive story of Civil War, World War I and II vignettes, this book was far from the ""major contributor to our understanding of the great American experiment"" that the dust jacket proclaims. Mr. Rehnquist is adequate in his historical background, and obviously enjoys explaining the history of the Supreme Court. I voraciously read the entertaining beginning chapters, expecting them to be a prelude to incisive commentary and analysis, only to find that the shallow descriptive text was all there was. By the final, repetitive chapter, I was left wondering what the point of the book was. While I appreciated the books accessiblity to the non-lawyer, more critical thinking would have been appropriate from the Chief Justice."
5,Brilliant and prescient,"Rehnquist wrote this before Sept 11, but it is a book that has added meaning today. Mostly the Chief Justice focuses on the suspecnsion of Habeas Corpus by ABraham Lincoln and its ramifications for Civil Liberties and the abuse of them during war time. This is not a lively account, but it is accurate, well thought out and makes for interesting reading, having added strength of authority by nature of its author.Seth J. Frantzman"
5,Tune Belt,This is great---if I can get the extender to connect it will be terrific. The Tune belt is fine and can be good.
3,dark comedy turns too dark towards end,Arye Gross and Tom Wood (U.S. Marshals) play friends who are trying to make it big and trying to make a big movie. Their sponser is Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix). The 2 find shelter in a storage place and thats where they meet the strange Ron Perlman (Hellboy)..who may or may not be the costume killer who kills his victims with window cleaner...but it turns out hes an actor portraying the killer in a movie directed by Kristy Swanson (Buffy The Vampire Slayer). Soon they all join forces into making a fresh and reallife movie about the costume killer. But after that it just turns too dark. Swanson is sexy and gorgeous....Gross and Wood are funny as hell...Pantoliano is a scream and Perlman is extremely hilarious. Also starring David Dukes as the real costume killer. The end is sort of forced.
4,"Good information, but dated style","This guide is a well-illustrated look at tried and true practices of portrait photography. That being said, the photos themselves seemed dated and almost Sears-portrait-esque. They are technically sound but do not push the stylistic envelope.If you're looking for a good explanation of standard practices, this will fit your bill.I personally was looking for something more along the lines ofLighting and the Dramatic Portrait: The Art of Celebrity and Editorial Photography, but with in-depth explanation of techniques instead of just examples. That book is highly recommended for more creative examples of portrait lighting."
3,"Good Book, but ...","It is hard to find good book about learning photography. All of them are same and you can get general information about particular subject.In this book you will see a lot of pictures, samples and advices like: make a good harmony, keep contrast ... But there are few information about how to make good photos."
2,too many photos and less info...,"It has too many photos and only a few lighting setups, and very little useful information."
2,Expected more for the cost!,"For the cost of this book, I expected more information and up to date photos. I think that this book and the High key lighting book should be combined for the same cost."
4,Great Movie,"A great depiction of the infamous Charlie Richardson, noted gangster of the 1960's London scene. Luke Goss shows that he did his homework before stepping into the shoes of such a character.Enjoyed the movie, language was a bit of a barrier the first time I watched the movie - but by the second and third time I viewed this movie, I feel as if I could recite some of the more noteworthy lines verbatim."
3,"Luke Goss,really great actor with what he is given to work with","I wanted to see this movie after seeing the trailer on line, thought it would be at the least entertaining. Let me start with the highlights of the movie Luke Goss does a great job as Charlie getting you to understand the complex nature of this not so sympathetic character from early childhood to adult you get a feel of how Charlie ends up the way he does and it's a pretty wild ride at that ! The one problem I had was the extremely heavy accents made it very hard to follow the dialogue and this got a little better as the movie progressed. Luke Goss's portrayal of Charlie Richardson was the only highlight of this movie he was gorgeous yet sinister , all in all it was worth the money paid-"
3,Brenda,This video now color is good. The pictuer is a little fuzzy. I got it for my little sister for her birthday I though it was good for a little girl.
2,Needs Editing Desperately,"I have never seen a published book with more errors: whole sections of sample code in the wrong places, wrong values in some examples, misplaced order of data entry. Thank goodness I was armed with a general knowledge of REALbasic before I started trying to use this. In addition, explanations are thin, and helpful tips (like cutting and pasting repetitious code) and almost non-existent. The projects are worthwhile, though, if you can get past the poor production of this book."
2,Disappointed.,"I had anticipated this book for a while, and unfortunately it was quite disappointing. Like the previous comment, I had noticed a section where the sample code was a duplicate of the previous chapter. That's an error too large to miss during editing. Another error I noticed was that one of the shortcut keys listed was incorrect. I couldn't figure out why something wasn't working out correctly, until I happened to try using different key combinations. The author had printed control, when he meant the command key.Also, the sample applications listed were a bit too rudimentary. I felt the author had good intentions, but the applications could have been a little more robust. It truly seems like the book was rushed to print. Sadly, ended up returning the book, because it's definitely not worth the cover price."
1,Not terribly helpful,"I would steer clear of this book. I bought it on a whim at a brick and mortar store, because it was the only bok on REALbasic they had. Caveat Emptor. I wish I could sell this book now, I didn't even open the CD on it.Content is lacking, full of errors and generally as helpful as a stick in the eyeball."
1,Almost as good as a television sitcom - but has less depth..,"Sorry. The predominant view has proven once again to be justified. I'm sorry I let my optimism lead me to purchase this book to find out. It really is a badly edited collection of unexplained and useless gimmicks. If there is a concept presented that has any worth in learning to write your own code, than it is extremely well hidden among the error laden examples.I have every book on RealBasic available now, and the O'Reilly book is the only one that truly helps one learn the product AND programming. On the other hand, Eric's book is good to build confidence without much lasting programming value. This book cannot claim to teach or build confidence - although I found it an interesting exercise debugging and proofreading the text and code - representing perhaps the only real experience to be gained through the use of this text."
4,"Not ""The"" book for beginners , but a good one none the less","I used to program on a trs-80 as a kid, so anything in terms of visual programing like this seems like science fiction at times. I liked this book, it shows how to flex SOME of the muscle of the RealBasic engine in smart and informative ways. I would say the cover price is a little much. That's why used book stores do business with Amazon. If you are new to RealBasic, I would say get the book, but not for $40."
2,Disappointed with the dark emotions,"I couldn't find any romance in this book. There were too many ill-feelings, hate, misunderstandings and animosity between the two characters. Very disappointed even with the quick ending how both characters resolved their anger and discovered that they loved each other only lasted a couple of paragraphs. It was such a downer and nothing in the book brought any positive feelings. I enjoy other Marton books, but please remember that these are ""romance books"" not ""negative, I hate you"" that went on during the majority of the book."
5,Collaborative project!,"Bay Area belly dancers have created a new business paradigm for performance DVD's. Each dancer has donated a skill (such as video editing, PR, graphic design, etc) to the collective, making this project a collaborative effort that is driven by a love of the dance rather than making a profit. Each performer will have equal and unlimited rights to reproduce and sell this labor of love."
1,very dissapointing,"It was a complete waste of money for me. I was very dissapointed. The title says by dancers for dancers so i was expecting something really professional and different, something i could learn from but i was very very dissapointed!"
4,A Great Norma,"Zinka Milanov's voice is at her prime here and she is in good company although I prefer Corelli's Pollione. The live sound is somewhat ""hissy,"" but as the other reviewer says, you get used to it. One must remember that Milanov was a dramatic soprano and not a colloratura, but she is brilliant here in every way. A must for Milanov collectors.By the way, I also have a recording of her 1954 live fromt he Met Norma with Blanche Thebom which is absolutely superb and in better sound. The poor reviews Milanov received in 1954 were probably because Callas reigned supreme in the early 1950s and no critic would praise a Verdian war horse in the role of Norma at that time. However, much that I respect and love all the recordings of the Callas Norma, I find myself listening to Milanov much more often. It is pure joy to hear her voice in all the tender passages and there is plenty of drama in the scenes with Pollione."
3,okay product,"My dog likes it because of it's den feel. But it's not sturdy for traveling. Not a hard bottom. I just keep it at home. Should've just bought the metal cage. over all, I don't regret buying it because my dog likes it. Just be prepared to keep it home."
2,A zipper that want zip.,"I liked the size for my Lacy, but the first time I put her into the carrier she manage to push the zipper until it broke. I sewed up half of the end zipper, but she still manages to get out. It needs a better zipper and a way to keep the pet from getting it opened. I like the light weight and all the screen to keep her cool."
1,Not true at all - From a parent,I did this treatment for my son with Autism. We went to a local practitioner and paid $125 per hour. Over two thousand dollars over a year timeframe with absolute zero results.Books like these are there to victimize parents of autistic kids who are looking to try anything under the world that can help their kids.
1,Be careful what you buy,Questionable medical advice from someone who got their MD degree from a distance education facility in Antigua should be looked upon carefully by readers. The book continues to dispense rather questionable ideas on working with allergies. I say save your money and consider going to a board certified allergist to get well.
4,Heal the Body with NAET and the Devi Nambudripad!,"The author is among the most talented doctors in the world. Her gifts are legendary! She explains how to heal the body and prevent illness with her patented and copyrighted medical inventions and writing. Dr. Devi Nambudripad developed NAET and her medical background includes acupuncture, chiropractor, herbs, kinesiology, and a Medical Degree (M.D.). Let Dr. Devi walk you into the world of health and balanced living.Dr. Devi Nambudripad is a breath of fresh air in a world of sick people. She is a very accomplished author and has published over ten books. She invented and founded the technology and process of NAET many years ago. The doctor has trained approximately 9,000 doctors around the world. Her patients come from around the world for medical care. She has published a NAET magazine for her NARF foundation for many years. We look forward to more books in the future.Dr. Rebecca Stone"
3,A great little device,"This is a whistle that sports a compass on one side and a thermometer on the other. Not shown is the lanyard it comes with. I have not calibrated the devices so I can't speak to their accuracy but it is a handy wear-around-your-neck tool when you just want a quick check or if you don't need to carry a more accurate tool. I wouldn't substitute it for a serious compass if you plan on being out in the wild, but as a handy little aid it's a great idea.Update/edit: apparently this product is now offered in conjunction with other items; I can't speak to those: when I bought this, it was possible to buy it alone for less money."
1,Fisherman's Challenge,"Dumb game. Graphics are good, but it takes way to long to reel in fish and it takes to long for fish to bite. Players swear after losing a fish and the hook snaps off really fast. Pretty dumb game. I wouldn't get this game if you hate waiting a lot."
5,I loved !,The poster is exactly what I wanted and expected. The delivery was timely and the poster was in excellent condition
3,Disappointing,"I found this book to be a disappointment. It does not add anything substantially new that cannot be found in a variety of other works. I personnally prefer Panzertruppen by Lannoy, though in French and English, it has more information and is vastly better illustrated. The only advantage to this book is the cost, but you get what you pay for."
3,Not quite good enough,"To be honest, or even blunt, a book that sells for 125$ should have 1. a better binding (it really feels like it's going to come apart) and 2. Fewer mistakes in it: I don't care that Mr Mitcham is ""world renowned"" in his field, some one should proof-read what he writes. I found a few technical errors and more than one typos and grammar problems.That being said, this reference book remains excellent, great to have around when reading related works and double check the info. However, for the mistakes mentionned above, i can't go higher than 3 stars...125$ is pretty steep, but if you are a die hard fan of WWII or a panzer buff, you should get all you need in this one."
5,Improvements Prompt a Lifestyle Change,"The book is an easy, but informative read. The author not only outlines the ways to make this diet compatible with your lifestyle, but also analyzes the biological effects your food and exercise has on your body. I have been eating healthier, looking more ""ripped"", and feeling better about myself since using Rehan Jalali's methods. I definitely recommend to anyone who wants to have a no nonsense diet and exercise plan that works."
3,Left hanging,I enjoyed the story but from the headlines on the front of the book I kept expecting something terrible to happen to Mary and so I felt kind of let down at the end. Plus I thought they would touch more on the past when she was doing all of the writing for him and not start it so late in the story. I mean you never really get any idea why she did this for so long and why in the world she kept it hidden after he died.
3,Interesting ideas,"I am a late comer to Nancy Price's novels, and I am enjoying reading her books. Night Woman is interesting because it might be possible for a ""ghost"" writer to be responsible for someone else's success. I am puzzled how Mary could do all she did for so many people and still find time to be a prolific, best-selling author. I think her self effacement didn't ring quite true - I doubt that anyone is that totally altruistic. I think many of us might have put Randal into a good long-term care facility rather than suffer his ongoing abuse."
2,Dissapointed!! DJ VLAD is better than this!!,"I bought this dvd, because I love brazil ladies and I know DJ Vlad is a great DJ, but I was very dissappointed in this DVD. None of the women got completely nude in their teases and the music was terrible and I know DJ Vlad is better than that! I would not recommend this DVD to guys (and/or women) who want to see beautiful brazilian babes mixed with great music, if you want that then get HIP HOP BADGIRLS and HIP HOP HONEYS: BRAZIL BOOM BOOM, those are great DVDs. This DVD boast a beautiful brazil babe named BABALU (who,like most brailian babes in these type of dvds, is a pornstar) and even she didn't get completely nude. The music was horrible compared to the dvds I mentioned, I know DJ Vlad can do better, lets hope so."
3,School Reading,This was a useful book for my reading curriculum. Was helpful when needing answers to certain projects that were assigned us.
4,HCDE 231,I ordered this book for a technical writing class at UW. Very helpful and well written but the book was not necessary to succeed in the class.
2,A Major Dissapointment,"This is a very disappointing album from a talented artist. The set includes two CDs and a poorly edited DVD. For the most part, I doubt that the producers put a whole lot of effort into making this set. The DVD does not include his most popular songs and looks very amateurish. It needs a real editor.The CDs are at least as bad. The instruments override the vocals on most numbers and there is too much verbiage. I got sick of Buffett telling us how much he loves Boston; sing for God's sake...don't talk. Also the electronic tags which identify the song to the track number were mostly wrong...100% wrong on the second CD and partially wrong for the songs at the end of the first CD. When I click on the track showing ""Margaritaville"", I want to hear that song, not ""Respect"" (arguably the best song on the album) instead.A previous reviewer commented that Buffett appeared tired and bored. A close look at the band's demeanor in the DVD verifies it.Overall, a major disappointment.Tom"
2,This could have been sooooo much better,"These CDs say they take the feed straight from the sound board, and therefore you get what you get or what actually happened. That's completely true. So when the performance is flat, that's what you get. Buy the Hawaii album. It's much better, and there is energy in the performance. I think the ""Ike Turner"" review above was a little harsh, but they hit the nail on the head with the comment about emphasizing the last word in each verse. That's overused on this album. I'm disappointed. The packaging makes it look like something special, but it's not."
2,"I'm Not Dead Quite Yet, Jimmy","The hour long DVD is alot of fun but not as much fun as the camcorder videos I shot back in the days when Jimmy concerts were the highlight of the summer and isn't worth twenty plus dollars. As for the audio part. Did we really need a 7th live recording of Cheesburger in Paradise?I may be middle-aged, I hate to admit, but I'm not quite dead yet, Jimmy and I just don't want to hear the same stuff over and over again. Bill Jabanoski's ""Key West, Island of Dreams"" makes me feel young and like there's still alot more life left to live. This tired playing out of your former glory doesn't.Sorry. This is from a Parrothead who was one before they called us that."
2,Raunchy and Dissapointing,"I thought the audio quality would have been better, and there were only 51 minutes of video. This is of course in reference to Billy Joel, Live at Shea Stadium, which was done really well. I said raunchy because they had girls covered in glitter and oil. This is something I would expect to see at a strip club, not a Jimmy Buffet concert. Overall it was a disappointment."
2,Jimmy Buffett Live at Fenway Park,This live CD does not have the energy that most of Jimmy's other live CD's too. I'm a Fenway Park/Red Sox fan too!
5,Jimmy has always been the greatest!!!,"What can I say? I have been listening and following Jimmy Buffett for 28 years. My wife and I sing all the songs and collect the CD's. This particular CD with the accompanying DVD has only one thing wrong....it is over too sooooooon!! Loved the DVD and have played it over and over. All the ParrotHeads know this and those who would be, get this and lose some stress."
3,Live but not alive,"Once again, Jimmy Buffett has turned on the Jimmy Buffett Machine for another ""live"" concert CD and then sleepwalks through the tried and true. If you want a solid, live Buffett album then head straight for You Had To Be There! when he still had unscripted passion in his concerts. Nowadays, many Parrotheads will tell you that the best part of a Buffett concert is the party in the parking lot while his hula-dancing and fire-juggling stage show is better suited to the Las Vegas Hilton."
1,Sorry I got this one,I am a Buffet fan but I hated this CD. The Acoustic guitar stuff is distorted. The rest has jimmy at his worst. I recommend choosing a different Buffet CD
1,"YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN THE SAME BALLPARK AS JABANOSKI, JIMMY","You can do Live From Fenway Park, Live From Wrigley Field, or Live From The Roman Coliseum, Jimmy. Truth is this series of live albums was getting embarrassing and expensive for fools like me who own everything you've ever put out, but the pandering to Boston Parrotheads and all the Red Sox references on this one is getting little short of pathetic. Please just give it up and spend your twilight years listening to musicians who still care about what they do like your pal Bill Jabanoski. His Key West, Florida, Island Of Dreams CD has seventeen great songs on it. That's more than you've done since the end of the 80s.P.S If anyone thinks I'm dissing Jimmy here just for the heck of it, I own Every single recording he's ever released and have been to more of his concerts in the past twenty years than most of you will ever see. But I work for my money. Jimmy doesn't seem to think he has to anymore."
3,"Worth the read, but not groundbreaking","Everyone should read this book, because it does do a wonderful job in getting you to analyze your attitude towards investing. However, it does nothing more than tout the high-rish high-yield style of investment while making it seem like anything more conservative is unthinkable. The book is pervaded with a condescending and snobbish tone, which is understandable to an extent, but it gets old. In short, investment advice we've all heard before partnered with pretentious motivational one-liners wrapped in an 'easy money' teasing which I'm sure Mr. Kiyosaki, with his experience in marketing, realized would sell this book. If you feel the need to buy a Porsche and retire at 40, perhaps you'll appreciate this book more."
4,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"Rich Dad Poor Dad has helped me accumulate an exceptional amount of knowledge about finances, liability, stock, bonds,and how to manage money. I now know and intend to act upon the skills that i have learned, i will also willingly teach any and everyone i come into contact with who are both financially stable and have come in contact with finacial difficulty."
4,Getting serious -- A must to read,"I am just getting started on learning about finances and this book came HIGHLY recommended by people that are successful. I have learned alot and Needed a more motivational book to get started, and keep me going through all those Dry books that I know will help me :)I am a daughter of parents that were every two week paycheck people. Now I am in Real Estate and realized that this is a whole different ball game. I have and am identifing with mentalities that go along with feeling like your entitled to a paycheck because you worked. NOT.. He very accurately describes the Rat Race that most people put themselves in instead of enjoying life. I plan to enjoy life because ""it is a good life"""
1,No substantive value!!,"The book talks in broad strokes about acquiring assets that generate income for you. While great in concept, its not really something that most people interested in building wealth did not already know. Beyond that, the book is short on detail and substance.More disturbing is the fact that this book appears to be a front for pushing multi-level marketing scams, i.e. Amway. There is apparently some relationship between the author and Amway aka Quixtar.Those truly interested in ways to build wealth should look elsewhere - more substantive and valuable advice is available from different authors."
2,Don't waste your time,He has one message. Make sure you are financially literate and then buy assets (ie property)...... Spent the whole book repeating this over and over again - yawn!!!!
5,Wish I had read this sooner!,"As many have posted previously, I sure wish I had read this book earlier. Although it primarily focuses on real estate investments, the concepts presented can be applied to other areas as well. I've purchased FOUR of these books (in addition to the one I purchased for myself) and have given them to many of my friends.Definitely a good read. Bounds of helpful information. Don't wait any longer and buy this book NOW!."
2,It give me a new plan about my finance,Writer 's expression is correct. we did not learn about control of money. untill now i only was concern to be expert or good worker. but he know that is not a mean of settling. we change our mind about money. this book is helpful to get rich idea about your finance in lifelong. sorry to my poor english...
2,Content doesn't merit an entire book,"The author takes nearly 200 pages to say what could've been said in one four page article. The book repeats itself over and over and over -- especially with regard to simplistic concepts that don't need to be hammered home. To add insult to injury, he glosses over the meaty, more substantial aspects of his treatise. He has some worthwhile views and precepts, but he is a poor writer and desperately needs an editor. Try to buy this book used or borrow somebody's copy -- a ""rich dad"" would never waste the money on such an item!"
1,Abridged Version: A Waste of Money,"I saw Robert Kiyosaki on Oprah and liked his basic premise. I bought the version of Rich Dad Poor Dad that consists of two tapes. What a waste of money! The author never gets into specifics. He tells stories that take too long to get to the point, as if the narrator is talking to a three-year-old child. He repeats the same points throughout the tape in a condescending manner. This information could have been shared in five minutes and shouldn't have been stretched out into three boring hours. In fact, I learned everything from watching Oprah. I've purchased many good products from Amazon, but this product was a waste of money."
1,"PURE TRASH, WORTHLESS, WASTE OF TIME","If I could give ZERO stars, I would, but that option is not available. This book is PURE drivel! That's the only way I can describe it. Absolutely no financial advice that you can use, except that you ""should save and invest money"" to become rich. Like one other reviewer said, DUH!Okay, now, how do you invest? What are the investments to make? How do you invest in real estate? No answers to those questions? All Kiyosaki says is ""Don't work for money, but make money work for you""... What the hell does THAT mean??!! Mindless platitudes like these abound in the book. If you want to read a point by point rebuttal to the nonsense in this book, go to this webpage by John T Reed (WestPoint graduate, Vietnam Vet and HARVARD MBA), http://johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html.John T Reed exposes Kiyosaki for the FRAUD that he is."
3,Great book to change your way of thinking about money.,"Too often we say, if I could just........If I could just get that raise, If I could just get that promotion, if I could just find a job; rather than making life happen. Don't sit around and wait for life to happen,but go out and make your own opportunities. Robert Kiyosaki gives you the inspiration and vision to make the necessary changes in our lives. He teaches us to invest in our selves first, before we go out and buy the toys. He explains that we should always be learning. Our education does not stop after college, but must be continuous."
4,I am now a billionairre after reading this book,"Come on now, if you thought the above sentence was true, and you got excited, nothing will help you. You are hopeless if you are looking for a quick way to make money, just go back to working as a telemarketer, and call it a life. If you are looking for some good solid principles for spending, and teaching your kids about money then it is good. I was already taight most of these theories by my father, so it wasn't as mind blowing as it could be for someone who has not."
1,Hogwash,"Financial pornography. Just another get rich book by a person who doesn't respect higher education.I read this after a number of acquaintances (OK, clients!) read this guy, went to this guy's lecture and then bought real estate using his advice. I wanted to see what 'pearls' this book had.This author is clearly making more money ""on the circuit"" and writing repetitive books than he did in buying/selling real estate. Subtract one star for bad writing."
3,Too wordy but factual...,"This book is worth a study not just a read. Besides that it is simply an entre'. With more puffery than facts it left me hungry for the main course. With the introduction of a game which far and away overpriced and more books which are priced beyond rationality it left me with the feeling of a guy who is full of himself. Yes you need this knowledge. You need it now. But at what cost? You probably should be able to get this type of ""information"" which includes every book and both of the games for about $200 tops."
4,This book makes you really think about working for money.,"I felt that this book was very interesting, mostly because the author goes against the norms of education (get good grades, get a good job, you're set type of mentality). This book really makes you think about why you want to work, and how to change your lifestyle over time so that the money works for you, not the other way around. The author has some good points on how the rich find the loopholes in the system to stay rich, and gives logical advice to help individuals become financially ahead of the game. I definitely do not recommend this book for those not willing to actually change their mentalities and lives. It is a very good guide to understanding how the rich get rich and how they differ from the poor, whether educated or not, people."
4,Highly Recommended,"I read this book cover to cover on a flight from LA to New York. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the stories have been embellished, but what hooked me was the essence of the book and its powerful message. This book will teach you or remind you of the principles for creating wealth and motivate you to get out of your ""j.o.b"" (just over broke). It's generally more inspirational than practical, but it does give an excellent overview and starting point for making positive changes in your life if your goals include creating financial freedom for yourself."
1,"Avoid, avoid, avoid!!","I know my original review was a long time ago but I retract my original review. Having done lots more research and being relatively successful in obtaining financial independence, there is nothing in this book that can't be obtained elsewhere and in a much better format.Plus as many reviewers have pointed out, this is a work of fiction(look at the book details in the first few pages). Kiyosaki made the bulk of his money from the sales of this book, not from investing. In fact, I destroyed my copy to prevent any other hapless soul reading this drivel.Sorry for my initial review. I was more naive in those days. Please avoid this book."
3,AFTER you have steady income to cover monthly bills.,"3 Stars only because of the story that contrasts Rich Dad and Poor Dad. But readers should know that Poor Dad is NOT a vagrant. This idea is mold-breaking to the average get-ahead person. You must create investments (stocks, businesses, etc.) to make money for you besides yourself. Multiply yourself. That's why double income families do better. This would be dangerous to high schoolers, without a warning. They might read this as, don't go to school. Remember Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard, you know what it takes to get there? This says, Life-Long study. School never ends, but pick what you like and learning is fun - tell that to your High schooler!"
5,A worthwhile read,"Actually, I wasn't too thrilled by this book at first and actually hated it. Seemed too flowery. Like make believe. Then I was introduced to a businessman in my community who amassed a net worth in excess of a million dollars in real estate and business in less than 2 years and he credited the technques and ideas taught by Kiyosaki for his wealth.I went to work and in my first month made more money than my college professors make in a year.What can I say---It WORKS. IT REALLY WORKS!"
2,How poor was that dad,"Although I think it might make financial sense; no, I won't teach any kid that way. There's still more than money to be thaught. I don't know how the real (poor) dad would fill reading his own son's masterpiece...I think you might better off reading something more human with books like ""Personal Finance for Dummies"". And treasure the great things in life, like teaching your kids..."
3,MONEY,"Redundant but interesting, Kiyosaki gets the point accross to the reader.....many times. However, I found most of what he said quite interesting and realistic, about building assets and what not. it's a good read for those who want to learn the games of the rich or just to laugh."
4,This book would should be entered under your assets column!,"While Kiyosaki is Mark Twain and his stories may be repetitive between the lines of this book is gold. There are lessons in this book that I would have never learned else were, because most people who understand the concept of ""making monaye work for you"" don't generally share or have the audience. It is essential that one reads this book before making future finacial decisions. Kiyosaki found a simple way to explain essential skills in finacail magement. It takes concepts you have heard and explains how they can work in your life. Everyone knows that you shoudl't purchase with credit, this book explains how through biulding your assets, that eventually there isno need for loans and debt. Kiyosaki has brilliantly sparked my interest and will do the same for you. This book will make money for by showing a different way to make money and have it work for you."
4,Fabulous advice,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a very well written thought provoking book on how to make it in today's business world. Kiyosaki is a very good writer and teaches financial knowledge very well through the use of simple diagrams. I thought it to be very interesting that a well educated person is not necesarrily the one who is going to make it in life. You have to know how to make money work for you rather than work for money. Kiyosaki provides clear and easy techniques with explanations on how to become more financially knowledgeable. Best of all, you could implement all of these techniques tommorow! Very interesting book. Well written."
1,Load of Tripe,"This book is a complete dissapointment. No real information on investment/wealth building. Full of ""great"" advice such as ""Sign up for seminars"", ""Stay out of debt"". Duh. The narrative style is odd, he keeps refering to some presumably fictionalized rich dad. Terrible."
2,SHEESH!,"I remember the key premise of this book being uttered by Claire Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show,"" when Vanessa's friends called her ""a little rich girl."" Attorney Huxtable, wife of the good Dr. Huxtable, sat Vanessa down and said ""Honey, we are not rich; rich is when your money works for you, not when you work for your money."" Well, duh! I think that the best way to get rich in America today is to write a book based on some premise that anyone with half a brain should already know!"
1,You get what you pay for!!,"The price of the product was great. However, you get what you pay for. When I recieved the book it was so small I literally needed a magnifine glass to read it. The book was 2 inches by 3 inches!! What a joke! I thought I was getting a good deal until I recieved the product. If I had of known that the book was useless I would have payed more for a regualar sized book. However, the size of the book wasn't disclosed in the sale. This was the first time I ever bought an item from Amazon because of a fear of being ripped off, and sure enough I was!!"
4,Now I know why this is such a classic.,"Rich Dad Poor Dad is an excellent story. Everyone should read this book (or audio CD) while they are still young. I don't agree whith everything that Kiyosaki said, but the overall theme is right on."
2,So-So. Good for a beginner or the very young,"Many of us have heard of this book, and there are almost 2000 customer reviews for it. There's some real gold in here, mainly something that'll get people motivated to learn about how money works and take more responsibility for their finances. There is a huge bias towards real estate, probably because that's what the author felt comfortable with investing in. Obviously not for everyone."
3,Nice Start - good base,"The first 75 pages are tough to get through, but I would suggest the book for the people looking to build a base for financial sense. Did not enjoy the last 15 pages of Cash Flow infocommercials. Just like anything, if you can learn a few good ideas - its worth reading."
2,Reads like an infomercial,"The book does cover some good concepts on how to approach money, assets, and liabilities. However, the author does not deliver specific ways apply this knowledge to become rich. And there several instances in the book where he promotes his game (VERY expensive) and his other products. A decent read, but not very helpful."
1,Miniature edition - look carefully.,"I had intended to buy the unabridged version of this book. I had no idea there was a 'miniature version'. Amazon included the link to the miniature version along with the links to the full version, which I think was inappropriate. Unless you are watching carefully (I wasn't!) you might not notice that you are buying the miniature version until after it arrives. The mini version is about 1 inch by 1 inch and does a terrible job of capturing the content of the full book. Worthless."
1,what a joke,"When ordering this i noted it was a hard copy version. Did not notice the fine print of ""miniature edition"" so I received a book not much bigger than a postage stamp! maybe 2 x 2 inches at most!!! pay attention is my advice...horrible!"
3,Use with caution!,"Some of the principles in this book are good, but many others are outdated. The idea that either you own the shop or work in the shop is a good concept. Using income to make income is great advice. His points on real estate, however are likely oudated. Give the book a read, but realize that some of its principles are from 10 to 20 years ago and the economic reality has long since changed. For example, good debt vs. bad debt is an interesting and important concept. However, many people and companies go broke not only from too much debt, but due to lack of cash flow. An unexpected expense or loss of income destroys their house of cards. In 2011, the healthy companies are very liquid (large cash reserves) and carry little or NO debt. The housing crisis and the Great Recession may have permamently altered aspects of the American economy, which means that some aspects of this book are maybe obsolete; or at best, should be read with a skeptical eye."
3,Good info but . . .,"The book was a good read and had good info, but for the most part, nothing really that isn't commonsense. (There were a few surprises, but not many.) Also, it really isn't applicable to me at this time in my life. I think the demographics are meant for someone a little older."
4,Provides a New Perspective,"From this book I learned why some of my most educated friends are some of the ""brokest"" people I know. These guys have spent their entire lives in college ""learning stuff"" that has no bearing on their financial lives and wonder why that third master's degree isn't bringing the cash they want. As a capitalist at heart, I'm always looking for ways to understand the system and this book opened my eyes to why the guy who owns the grocery store down the street with little education can take is wife of 30 years on vacations after vacation and the ""three-masters degree"" guy is complaining about making ends meet. READ IT! You'll walk away with a new perspective."
4,Good bedroom/bathroom reading,"This is an anecdote, a light reading. Good for traveling. I already know the concept and have already played the Cashflow game."
4,"Childish some times, but very interesting","It was an interesting book. I got tired and I skipped pages in points that the same were repeated over and over. The speech in some points was too childish, but the main points were interested and they reflect the reality. The personal examples were excellent, you learn better by them and you can compare them with personal experience."
5,A Primer To Stop Broke Thinking,"This was an absolutely awesome book. Some of the concepts are already well known but the authors found a way to make these truths jump out and grab you. I read it , my wife read it, I'm bribing my 16 year old to read it and I will read it to my 9 year olds. I have also recommended this to most of the partners in my group. A good book to read after this would be The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason."
3,This book is kinda cliche'd,"I bought this book a few years after graduation, after hearing numerous quotes in many places about this book.Does it help you to rethink your financial standing? Yes..Is it inspiring... ? Not so. There's another book that I would recommend you reading, but I'm not quite familiar with the title, but it's from the same author.This book is easy to read, good for teens, but it's not into complicated financial management. It's a good read for a weekend on a beach!!."
1,Dissapointed,"I ordered this book for my sisiter expecting it to be just like my copy of the book. It was in fact a minitautre book, a 2"" by 2"" (aproximately) book with very little of the information inside. This is a great book, I just didn't get what I thought I ordered."
4,Changes how you see your $,"Though only 3/4 through, this has changed everything. How I look at money, how I decide to spend and on what. it gives Purpose and goals to work towards - Get out of the Race!"
4,The best-selling book with below average content,"This book is obviously extremely successful. I think that the author does a good job making people think differently and believe that they can achieve financial freedom. The majority of successful people have different mental attitudes and do not let their failures affect them as much. The criticism that I have with this book is that it makes everything seem just so easy. Some people may get disappointed after trying and failing due to the lack of enough effort. Also, because the author preaches that placing debt on the property is advisable, this advice could have contributed to some extent to people getting overleveraged in real estate and now that prices have collapsed, they are paying the price.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
2,dissappointed,"This is a real beginner book and does not tell readers anything they don't already know for the most part. Read the Millionaire Next Door instead! Its amazing to me how authors can write crap like ""you just need to put money in your assets column"". In my opinion, find books that focus on tools to overcome lifes obstacles that get in the way of smart financing. I also don't subscribe to this authors implication that money solves lifes problems. It doesn't."
4,Worth Reading,I found this book to be straight forward in it's explainations. The discussion on assest vs liabilities is excellent. I have recommended this book to friends
3,Not for everybody's reading,"The book gives a strong insight of financial freedom, yet the simplicity it presents could create misleading to some people understanding of the real financial world. I notice those who wrote the comment about this book has lost some of the important points that the author tried to deliver."
2,"A good story, but not an instructional book.","I'd have given it three stars if it had more substance, but, for a purported bestselling financial guide, this book is really just a story about Mr. Kiyosaki growing up. I could easily summarize the useful tidbits of information in this review space but that wouldn't be right. I suspect that the book is more of an advertisement for the Cashflow games. But, to be fair, he does present an interesting perspective on the relationship of Income/Expenses/Assets/Liabilities. Not anything earth-shattering, though. If you've already read any other financial guide, economics textbook, stock or mutual fund prospectus, or can balance your own checkbook this book isn't going to teach you anything new."
1,This is not a FULL SIZE book,"I've read Rich Dad Poor Dad before and wanted to purchase another copy for a friend. When I opened my package from Amazon, I was disappointed to find this book is the physical size of 3""x3.75"" and as you can imagine, contains less than a full chapter of information of the full sized book. Why on earth would they make a book with the same title, this size with a fraction of the text of the full sized book? Do not buy this product because it's useless. Make sure you purchase the full sized book, not the ""Miniature Edition""."
4,A must read book for parents and teens.,This is a very interesting book. I finished it in two days; was so hooked to it once I started reading. I wish I had read it 10 years back. It would have helped me save a lot more money than I have today.
2,Not FULL version!!!,"I was recomended this book, and saw great reviews on it, so I decided to buy it, and hope I could get some really useful information out of it. yeah, not so much.... this is like an overview, I made the mistake of not noticing it is an abridged version. Bad on my part! I usually only buy childrens books and would've never expected this! Well, I know better now!! I'd just say, buy the full version.. this one doesn't seem to have that much useful info. I think my 4 yr old would like more than me..."
3,Educating you on what is required to get rich.,"Robert point's out what the rich teach and do to get rich and what the poor do, to stay poor."
3,John-OSU,"I believe that while Kiyosaki does an excellent job of emphasizing the importance of financial literacy and gives much helpful information, I think he tends to oversimplify the process of gaining financial freedom. The author is a shining example how hard work and determination can get people anywhere in life. But I found myself, more often than not, noticing that sometimes in the book Kiyosaki made the goals so simple like infomercials on TV. All he says you have to do is follow some simple steps and you will reach financial freedom. He had many resources to jumpstart his career that the average citizen would not have access too. I enjoyed this book and I think Kiyosaki has many good ideas but I just think he tends to oversimplify the process of gaining financial freedom."
3,"Some Good Ideas, but Also Some Obvious","Rich Dad, Poor Dad had some idea that I thought were ok, but most of them were obvious. Mr. Kiyosaki's story telling ability was what I liked about this book. His told his main theme of ""getting out of the rat race"" repeatedly through various examples. His methods seem to rely heavily on going into business for yourself and real estate. In his case - he combined the two. This method has worked (look at Donald Trump), but it is not the ideal method for novice or risk-adverse investors. I gave this book 3 stars because I felt that the price was not worth the information contained inside."
1,BUY Thorstein Veblen to REALLY become wealthy!,Don't be fooled by get-rich-quick books like this one. Become really rich by applying the priciples espoused by Veblen in 1899. Thorstein was a genuine academic - not a capitalistic author trying to get rich selling books!
1,"Belittles Education, Thinks Money = Happiness","I had many problems with this book: 1) Kiyosaki is a terrible writer, and the cute little anecdotes of his childhood made me gag. 2) Tells people the obvious (making money is better than spending money - duh!). 3) He basically says that being educated financially is better than being educated in a formal system, thereby belittling college education and such. 4) He seems to think that money is equivalent to happiness, therefore the more you have of it, the happier you are. How wrong he is! I absoltely detested this book and a lot of the things he had to say, and I am shocked to see that it's supposedly a best-seller."
4,Good informational read,"I found this book to be intriguing. I never thought about the points that were brought up in the book, and I recommend it for everyone to read it, because the book approaches from an angle that many of us never see. All minute details aside, the book gives the reader a good point of view in finances, which makes a huge impact in our lives.I'm not quite sure whether or not his advices and tips, beliefs are good or dangerous, but for me, it opened up a door to a different world."
2,the future: good finances and a large cup of coffee,"Robert Kiyosaki explores the influences he recieved from his two ""dads"": his father, who is well educated, but financially unstable, and his best friend's dad, who dropped out of school in eighth grade, but is now a millionaire. His main theme was showing how to ""make your money work hard for you instead of working hard for your money."" This book contains valuable lessons in investing, and is easy to understand for someone, like me, who doesn't know much about it. However, Kiyosaki starts repeating himself and becomes dull as the book progresses. Unless this subject really interests you, the book becomes boring."
4,Wealth Made Simple?,"Rich Dad Poor Dad is filled with interesting ideas on how to become rich. From reading this book, Kiyosaki pounded the idea into my head that school will not make you rich and you must be financially literate to successfully have ""money work for you instead of working for money"". Believe me, the explanation of this is not brief in any possible way. His repetitive statements at first were bothersome, but it really helped my understanding of the points he was trying to get across to me, the reader. I learned some valuable things from this book that hopefully will strengthen my skills when I eneter the working world. The biggest problem with this book was that after reading it, I realized that Kiyosaki's approach to wealth was now the same approach as everyone else who had read the book. It is disheartening to know that the secret to success is not quite a secret anymore."
1,I Must Be a Genius!!,"I must be a genius because everything I learned from this book I already knew. The only think I learned from this book is that I need to start investing. Wow! Thanks! I already knew that. I guess I was looking for a book that would educate me and give me some real life examples of how to accomplish this objective. However, the only advice I received from this book was that I needed to become financially educated and that I should read more books. Not to sound too sarcastic, but that is why I purchased this book. I can read a million books about finances and if they have as much sound advice as this book did, I will die a very poor man.If you want an entertaining book, this is the book for you. However, If you want a book that gives sound financial advice with the instruction manual, you better keep shopping."
2,What's the message? Make money on the backs of others?,"I had trouble finishing the book. The underlying message for making money is to treat employees badly and don't worry about personal ethics.Examples, the authors first enterprise was a comic book library using magazines that were unsold and should have been thrown out. Another story suggests buying low priced property when sold for unpaid taxes.Rich Dad looks down as employees and figures why pay them well, since they will not use the money wisely. From the description of his house he doesn't spend money on family either."
4,Did I like Rich Dad Poor Dad? Yes I did.,"I thought this book was very well written and explanitory. It helped me to understand certain things about the economy and managing my money. It was, however, repetitive in some places but that was easy enough to overlook. All in all reading this book made for a good learning experience and an enjoyable read."
4,Probably the best book for those whom want to learn about $$,"One of the best book ever written about how the money works, how we can achieve wealth and how the riches think and act. I highly recommend to anyone whom are interested in the fields above. Prabably everyone. Read it and you'll be inspired and amazed at how easy it is to achieve great wealth and power. Fairly interesting book to read off the bat. 4/5 stars. I've read better books in my life but this one is one of the best!"
5,Stunning in the simplicity of its wisdom,"I have to laugh when I read some of the comments below about Robert Kiyosaki (skepticism about author's claims, incorrect acounting notions, etc.). This is one of the most eye-opening business books I've ever read. How I wish this type of methodology would have been taught to me when I was graduating from college and entering the business world. I'm just glad I read it before it's too late. It's incorrect I think to consider it simply as a career-path book. However, even if you become a teacher, doctor, or follow some other path that is your passion, it's still wise to develop ""financial intelligence"". And as far as ""incorrect accounting notions"", I studied accounting, and accounting has been a central part of my career to date. Robert's assertions can be perceived as simplified, but they are right-on for today's economic climate in my opinion. This book should be a permanent addition to your bookshelf, no matter what your career calling is."
3,In the long run!,"This book was good for people that need people to give them a little booston how to manage their money. If you want to hear a real life story on how a person could become a millionaire, read this. It helps you manage your money, so that in the future you can be in good shape. People that would like to save a little should read it. I would recommend it to my mom."
4,"The Rich Dad, Poor Dad Review",I highly recommend this book readers of all ages. It is an easy read but very informative. It enables you to think of money in a way that is out of the ordinary. Becuase the author learned at such a young age it motivates teenagers that their money habits today will effect their tomorow. I am now aware of assest and liabilities and will rethink the way I spend my next pay check. This book made me realize that to get rich one must think and introspect. Once that is done and one is able to set aside money as well as properly invest wealth will come. I look forward to reading more books by this author.
1,Rich.... if you're willing to sell your soul?,"Ok, here's the deal. While this book did have some interesting insights and tips, it left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to advocate being rather cut-throat to get what you want. I guess if you don't mind walking on the poor and middle classes, then this is your way to wealth. I get the whole point of not living in fear, but does that mean you must intimidate others? I guess I'm one of those people who value honesty and decency over mounds of money. Who wouldn't want to be rich? But I'm not willing to sell my soul to get there. So if that means I will live the rest of my days in the middle class, so be it."
2,First Review,"The first review pretty muchs nails it. Not a whole lot of information. Mostly just buzz words being thrown around.Don't get me wrong, this is an easy read and somewhat motivational but I would not purchase this book thinking you are getting any real investment ideas. The book talks of ""Rich Dad's"" success but there is no real rich dad. When Kiyosaki was asked if rich dad was real he compared to rich dad to Harry Potter.Before taking any of his ideas seriously, please enter his name on wikipedia."
3,Good Information...but not necessarily for teenage students,"I really enjoyed this book, but there were times when I was completely lost. Being a high school student I need to know as much about money as I can, since I will be living on my own in the near future. This book had many helpful concepts including things that my parents (established medical doctors) didn't even know. And other things that I really didn't care about at all. The concept about liablities versus assests is very interesting. This book calls the United states to reasses the style and content of education regarding money and finances. There is no class about this type of subject in public schools, which i attend, and we all need to know about it since that is what our life will be like when we leave the comfort of our parents. This book makes some intresting points while at times it rambles and confuses the average reader. Maybe I'll understand the points it was trying to make a little more when I try to manage my own finances."
3,good book,"I found this book to be very informative, the only problem was that i didn't understand all the points he was making. I think I am just a little too young for this book otherwise it would have worked out. This would be a great book for anyone looking to improver their financial status, and in the long run have more money. As a person of the middle class I think this book would be great for my parents if they wanted to have more money."
1,Fairy Tale,"This is a good fairy tale, nothing in this book is true. I will agree that after reading the book you will be motivated and encourage to do many things.Haven't you ever heard, that if anything is to good to be true, than it probably is) Kiyosaki is rich, however only by us the consumer buying his fairy tale books.I would recommend that you go to the library and check the book out instead of buying it. I would rate this book higher, but after reading and looking for information, Kiyosaki does not have any facts to go with his information about the book.Amway is one of his major assests/backing. Did you know that he will give free speeches for Amway, however charges everyone else a fee.If you look in the Smart Money Magazine, Feb 2003, they will tell you the same thing I trying to tell you. Kiyosaki is using someone else story and making money off of it.No facts to back up his ventures, which is a big downer, ( I thought this guy was the real deal)"
1,Save your money,"I can't understand the popularity of this book, and the string of exploitative titles that came after it. The so-called financial advice is simplistic and obvious, presented in poor to average writing and laughably unconvincing anecdotes.I'm sorry I bought it."
2,A Waste of Paper,"This book will not make you rich. This guy made a bunch of money in real estate by buying properties that increased in value, but he hints that many of those opportunities are gone or difficult to find. He says that you should own a business instead of working for someone else. This is good advice, but not worth buying the book. He says that you should not borrow heavily (home, auto, etc) since you're throwing money away. Again, good advice, but not worth buying the book. Beyond these, the book doesn't say much. It's a waste of paper, with a catchy title."
2,Very vague... and unfortunately ridden by one giant lie,"While I thought this book was still a valuable tool it has one problem. There is no ""rich dad,"" Rich Dad was a lie fabricated to sell the book, which worked VERY WELL. On top of that it has been verified much of the info in the book was made up on the fly. All in all, the book wont really teach you much. But there are a couple points I thought that were VERY... no sorry, EXTREMELY valuable.*If you are young, like I am... pay close attention to the RAT RACE. Its a great term for the financial trap most people get themselves into in their early 20s. I can thank this book for steering me away from it!*ASSET vs LIABILITY awsome thing to keep in your head at all times when your in a spendy mood!All in all it was a pretty good book for me for just those two reasons. Unfortunately I cannot give it more than 2 stars for the simple fact that most of the book lives a lie!"
1,Don't waste your money,"If there is any good information in tis book it is over 40 pages till you get to it. So far after reading the first 40 pages the only thing I learned to make me richer is don't buy this book. The back and forth banter between a 10 year old and his father is boring, uninformative and drawn out. If there is a point the writer should get to it."
1,"This book is typical ""get rich quick by flipping properties"" garbage","This book is every ""get rich quick flipping properties"" late night infomercial cliche boiled down and committed to paper.I literally burst out laughing in chapter six when he says he and his wife had ""more than one million dollars in cash"" and just one paragraph later says that he had to borrow $2,000 from ""a friend for 90 days for $200"" in order to make a down payment.A ""millionaire"" has to borrow $2,000 from a FRIEND at 10% for 3 months?????? Right..."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book out of curiosity, to see for myself what the hype is all about.I have to admit that the first part really drew my attention. Co-writer Sharon Lechter did a good job placing the story in the setting of two kids growing up. It makes the simple content digestible.But then out of the blue Mr. Kiyosaki takes the word and it feels like the editor didn't have the time to finish her job. It is embarrassing to see K. showing off and telling us how he made his fortune being a real estate speculant.Regards,Norbert"
4,"Great Advice, Poor Writing","This is a great book presenting a refreshing perspective on the financial world and it's workings. The book's only weakness is poor writing and editing (typos, poor sentence structure). Still a recommended read."
5,"Poor is permanent, being broke is temporary.","What a book!It will change your perpective on education and economy. You will see the world as it is, not the way people want it to be...which leads to 'poorville'.It is recommended for high school students, as it was part of summer reading list bck when I was in h.s. If you have kids and want them to succeed in life this book is for you and them. Before giving it to your child read it. It will change you, and after that you will be able to help your child be successful instead of impeding it. I know you mean well, but in digital world analog thinking will not survive.Read it, and make your kids read it, for it will shape your lives for success."
4,Great Book if you're willing to throw out old beliefs,"This is a fantastic book if you never had a rich dad or the rich dad you have never taught you anything about money. A lot of good idea's here, the best one being: if you really want to be rich, read more books about the subject. Educate yourself."
2,Common sense and lack of applicability,This book beats common sense issues to a bloody pulp causing the reader to want to pull his or her hair out. I read through this entire book just because I bought it and didn't want to waste my money. He has a lot of beneficial things that should be done if one wants to become financially secure. Some of the main things that ruined the book for me was him saying how he turned $5000 into a million dollars extremely easy and in a very short time. He also puffs seminars and other things that people like him profit off of. This book is probably good for someone in middle school that needs to get topics pounded into their heads. If you are financially retarded buy this book and try and sift through the impossible advice and the logical advice...You'll go crazy.
1,bad principles,"Making money is fine and I looked for advise when reading this book, but is it just me or this books paints a world of slaves(poor guys serving rich guys) and uneducated, materialist and mercenary people?Omar"
4,Changed my life,"This is the first book that I can say has changed my life. I read it while I was in the hospital for one week. When I came out of the hospital and went back to my office, I realized that I was the poor Dad that he mentions in the book, even though I was head of the company and was very well paid. I have read it again and what I cannot forget is when he tells us to ask ourselves,,,it is not ""I cannot afford this"" but ""How can I afford this""!My wife and I have our own business now, have set goals for the short and long run, and are happier than ever. We have more time to spend with our kids!It is an amazing book! I go around recommending it to others and giving it as birthday and Christmas presents"
3,Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids about Money¿that the Poor and the Middle Class Do Not! (Rich Dad's),Good motivation tool. Great for pointing out what the rich have and poor don't. Other then that it lack the information I'm looking forward to become financially educated. Guide post at best.
4,A guide to thinking savy,"Whether you model the author's actual approach to wealth or not, ""Rich Dad"" gives readers a very interesting and savvy way to approach your financial life. As a college graduate in my mid-20's, I was not unfamiliar with the ideas presented by Kiyosaki, though reading his book was a great reminder and wake-up call! Most readers with even idle interest in personal finance will get through this book in one or two sittings. Others, looking for ""quick schemes"" or ""easy answers"" will probably throw the book down midway in frustration. The writing style is extremely simplistic and the author repeats himself a little excessively to be considered a 5-star book by my standards. But all-in-all, its a valuable resource and excellent starting point for those interested in financial literacy!"
5,Makes you think,"It was a pleasure reading this book. I have been working as an employee since I graduated, thinking many times that it would be good to have a small business too. This book only makes my wish stronger. Kiyosaki's mantra to remember, 'Don't work for money, make money for you'."
2,This is a miniature book!,This is a miniature book!I like the original whole book but this is a pocket book!
2,"Inspirational, BUT...","This book does do one thing...pumps you up. However, Kiyosaki cannot support any of the claims he has made. Do some research on the internet and compare this book to some of his other books and you will find many inconsistencies in his life story and outrageous claims. Or better yet, go to www.johntreed.com and look at his analysis of the book. He's done all the work for you! It is extremely interesting, especially after you've read the book!For anyone who is interested in financial freedom, I recommend researching authors before their buying books and then decide who you believe is crediable. I wish I would have learned this a few years ago...I would have save a lot of money!There are a lot of good sources out there. I have read about countless books and articles on financial success over the past three years...many good and many bad. This book is certainly one of the most interesting...but don't look to it for real answers. There's none here."
1,Complete and total BS!,"He's the only one getting rich.He NEVER gives any secrets, just repeats how smart he is.A chain letter is about the same idea."
2,"Too Long, Too Obvious","This book could have been much shorter and just as effective. The basic premise is obvious, but I suppose there are those out there that find it a ""revelation"". Suggest you get from the library instead of purchase.Is useful as a reminder as to what you should be doing, but low on practical ""how to"" applications."
2,"Description did not mention ""miniature""","This is not the full length book. I was disappointed when it arrived and was only 2"" x 2"" . Good luck finding the actual book on Amazon."
5,ATTENTION,I was very fortunate to be able to buy my copy of Rich Dad Poor Dad at an incredibly low price. The condition ofthe book was very good. Robert T.Kiyosaki's financial wisdom will speak to both the middle class as well aswealthy. Take time to read this book and find a return on your investment that beats inflation.
4,Great for Beginners!,"If you've just decided you want to become an investor, or you've been an investor but it's not working out, READ THIS BOOK! It explains what rich people do that you can learn. How to think Rich. But I have one suggestion to make, after you buy this book don't stop! Buy more books on the subject you want to go into, because Robert Kiyosaki does not explain in this book HOW to actually invest, he just gives you what you need to begin - the right mindset. So go ahead, buy this book, but do yourself a favor and buy more books as well."
1,Awful,"This is an absolutely awful book. It is amazing, and not a little sobering, that Kiyosaki's book which champions some of the worst traits in human nature, should be so popular.Kiyosaki worships greed, meanness, cunning, shrewdness and lack of compassion. It really is difficult to see how this man could say ANYTHING of value. His real dad may have been poor, but his real failure was in failing to teaching K. to be a full human being capable of intimacy and love. Instead what we see is a pushy and insecure consumer boasting of his Lamborghini's and Rolex's but unable to relate to other humans with decency and respect (unless they are rich). Seriously, how much more pathetic can one get?This is, basically, a book for losers. W"
5,"Great, Insightful book!","As a high school student, I thought I would not understand this book at all, that it might have difficult financial jargon and complex ideas only understandable to few. However, Robert T. Kiuosaki's explanation and comparison of the educationa and perspectives between the rich and poor provide insightful ideas for anyone to understand. He basically dispells the myth that you have to have a high salary to be rich, shows you that your house is actually a liability than an asset, and that you cannot rely on schools to teach students on how to be financially competent.This book is a must read for anyone and everyone."
3,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","This is a very good book for people who are starting a buisness of their own or people who already have a buisness of their own. This book gives a modern perspective for a financially secure future. You have to have a lot of patiance to read this book because, Kiyosaki gets very detailed at times, but other wise it was an easy read."
3,rich facts poor writing,"Being a student and for a class assignment had to read a book dealing with economics. My teacher recommended this book and I found it rather interesting. This has truly helped me prepare me on what to expect of the real world. Even though, Kiyosaki is not the greatest writer repeating facts through out his book it helps you understand what he is trying to say. It would have been wonderful to use facts from today's wealthy men and women instead of the rich and dead.I do recommend this book to anyone stuck in the rat race and to prepare themselves for every unexpected turn they will find."
2,Good lessons wrapped in a distasteful format,"Although the messages the author tries to convey are important, the 195 pages it takes to present them is ridiculous. There's probably only about 35 pages of real content here, and an overabundance of fill and repetition make up the rest. In addition, the format of comaring Rich Dad and Poor Dad leaves a sour taste in this reader's mouth; I am uncomfortable with the aparent disdain the author has for his biological father. He may not actually feel this way (I certainly hope not!), but that is the impression one comes away with.In short, there are some very important lessons in this book, and it is worthwhile to extract these lessons, however distasteful some of the writing may appear."
3,Encouragement to start,"Mr. Kiyosaki does not pretend to offer solutions to specific personal financial situations nor does he promise success to everyone just from reading his book Rich Dad Poor Dad. He does, however, promise (as stated on page 19) that the lessons he followed and provide are ""not meant to be answers but guideposts. Guideposts that will assist you and your children to grow wealthier no matter what happens in a world of incresing change and uncertainty."" That is the way I read the book. The easy to understand method in which it was written made the authors ideas seem achieveable for anyone. I look forward to making some of these changes in my life and wonder if some of the people that have reviewed this book unfavorably have made any attempts yet financially or are still thinking the ideas are ""too simplistic"". Rich Dad Poor Dad has encouraged me to start. It's worth reading and giving to those to whom you wish success."
4,Not just for parents,"I don't have children, but I still found this book very valuable. If you are looking for a ""how-to"" book, this isn't it. However, if you are looking for particular views on financial philosophies of the wealthy, this book is great. There is some repetition, but it is a very easy read and quite interesting."
1,"Rich Dad, Self Absorbed Dad","The basic gyst of this book is ""find a way to get money to work for you,"" i.e. invest it in something. The author is so self righteous and equates being rich with being and doing what's right.He gives a very weak defense about screwing other people to get there. Sure, there are lots of ways to get rich, but none of the ones he has listed will actually do anything good for society- his fortune was made almost completely off jacking up the price of real estate...not exactly something that I'd be proud of telling my kids about."
1,"A Letter, or at most, Legal size of paper should be enough","A cup of milk is nutritious. A cup of milk in 10 lb of water give you almost the same nutrition, if not more. But what do you feel?The author does have a good idea or two, but he IS a salesman. He promot them in a misleading way just like all the want-get-rich-guys you can see on TV commercials. Haven't we already see some people quickly figure out, after reading his book, that they should not go to college, but instead, getting rich quick by managing smart people.It's true that Bill Gates dropped out of Harward and becomes the richest man, but that doesn't mean every out-of-schools can become Bill Gates -- You have to be smart enough to get in there anyway.Like an old saying, learn swim in the water -- The result may vary, you are warned. Make sure you have a rich dad taking care of you. Good luck."
2,Feel good book with no financial wisdom,"This is a great motivational book for the financial neophyte that wants to take charge of their life. That being said, there is NO information in this book to do just that! Robert T. Kiyosaki can spin an interesting tale of rags-to-riches thru sweat 'n toil, but he is too busy tooting his own horn to give you any insights. As I was reading this book I was waiting for the details, instructions, SOMETHING to point me in the direction to financial freedom that Robert T. Kiyosaki was talking about, but NOTHING! I'll give it 2 stars for an interesting, albeit fictional, story."
1,Waste of Time!,"This book was a total waste of time and money! It contains nothing but the author's boastful stories and is very light on any useful content. What a scam!I should have read some of the negative reviews before buying this book, and I could have saved some money.Do yourself a favor, if you are looking for financial education, look somewhere else."
1,This book is fiction...,"Book lacks any real substance and is misleading. The author seems to be making all his money on books, not real estate. I suggest checking out the web site of John T. Reed (the url is his name) for the truth on Kiyosaki."
1,Not a true story,"The idea that this book is a true story has been debunked many times, in most detail by John T. Reed. And it's unclear the Kiyosaki made any money investing in real estate, it seems much more likely his wealth stems from these books and the multi-level marketing schemes that helped make them successful.The book itself can be inspirational, but his specific advice is silly and wrong headed. Setup a corporation to get rich? Sure if you want to pay extra fees to lawyers and accounts and higher taxes. Deduct personal expenditures like watches and vacations from your taxes using your corporation? Sure if you want to commit tax fraud."
1,What a crock of .........,"The book begins by indicating Robert has two dads. One by birth, the superintendent of Hawiai public schools and his playmate's father. He's caught in a quandry of weather to follow his biological but ""poor"" dad's financial advice or his friend's fathers. He has come up with a great idea for writing a book. Too bad there are so many errors in regards to financial concepts. Also, this ""character"" seems to be writing quite a lot of finction that he attempts to pass off as truths. Check out these online resources for more info about this book[. . . and . . .]"
4,Absolutley Insightful,"This book was truthful and insightful. I recommend this book for anyone wanting to get out of the rat race, translation paying bills and not having enough money. Mr. Kiyosaki, provided information that was ever so present but somehow living life we overlook or ignore it."
5,This book changed my life!,Growing up as a poor kid in the mountains of North Carolina allowed me to learn a lot of bad habits and bad attitudes about money.Robert Kiyosaki deftly strips all of that away with this insightful and brillinatly inspired work.
5,Insightful financial information,"Mr. Kiyosaki hit home for me while I read this book. Growing up not being taught how to manage money and credit has hindered me as an adult. I now realize areas in my financial plan that need to be addressed, because of the information in this book. A must read for high school seniors."
3,cynical and sad,"Some of the ideas in this book are potentially transformative -- particularly the notion that increasing income through employment is not the best way to get wealthy, or even to get ahead.Ironically, this book shares a troublesome premise with its polar opposite, ""Your Money or Your Life."" ""Rich Dad"" promotes freedom through wealth. ""Your Money"" promotes freedom through frugality. Both disparage WORK as a vehicle for involvement with the human community.I'd venture a guess that most of us aren't desperate to be freed from working entirely. I know that what I would prefer is meaningful, socially useful work (with reasonable hours and work load) and fair reward for the value I create for others/society/humanity.It seems very cynical and sad to conclude that working per se is so inherently degrading that people should seek to avoid it, either by ""getting rich and letting other stupid schmoes work"" or by shrinking from engagement with the human economy (as opposed to The Economy.)"
4,Good basics,"This book is not as detailed as I had hoped, not surprising though since it would give away too many secrets and not allow for future books to be sold. I mean really, the guy is making his ""millions"" off of all of us buying his books on how to get rich!"
2,Launching a thousand day traders,"There may be some reasonable if not exceptional investment advice here, but let's face it. The folks that write this mediocre stuff for the infommercial circuit got rich when the marks started buying this stuff with wild eyed dreams of enormous wealth. Never mind that structural issues in a capitalist economy make this program unavailable to many, the suckers will buy into it out of desperation. At root this is a very cynical and dangerous book."
4,Becoming rich not over night and not necessarily monetarily,This book was very good. It teaches you to use your mind in everything that you do. Once you become a buying consumer part of the world it is hard to get out of that trap hopefully everyone will read this book and get out of the trap.It was very motivational as well. I think after I read this book in a couple of hours I could have conquered the world. So here I am trying to conquer the world. My Dad recommended this book I am just sorry I didn't read it sooner. Definitely read this book if not to get get rich then for the motivational aspects. I would recommend it to anyone.
3,"Decent advice, poorly written","The thoughts are good, and worth hearing. The author constantly uses ""Rich Dad"" in each sentence where the advice or example is used, such as ""I really learned from Rich Dad."" After 3 chapters of hearing ""Rich Dad"" this and ""Rich Dad"" that instead of hearing the guy's name, I threw the book on the floor and haven't picked it back up."
3,Careful Now!,There is some content within this book that is excellent. Just be careful that in obtaining it you don't fall into a pit of deception...because those are definitely present.
1,snake oil salesman,"this guy is a con artist, snake oil salesman. the fact that this book is still on sell on amazon just shows how low the averaging Joe's financial IQ can be. this book and all others written by him are total trash, he gets rich by selling this trash to the average joe who wants to learn a ""secret"" of getting rich. what a shame!"
1,sucks!,"I'm looking at the book, and expecting a real live book. instead, I received a 1 1/2 inch tiny book! What an absolute rip-off!"
3,Read the last Chapter,"This book, although a great starting place for people who don't really know what they are doing, I found it to be extremely repetitive to the point where i was frustrated to read it. This book doesn't really give you any insight to the way you should invest. It pretty much gives you a mindset to put your money out there without any guidance as to how. I think the only part worth reading is the last chapter where he offers you 10 helpful steps. ...There are so many other HOW-TO's out there that are actually worth getting your hands on. I suggest you find those first and then if you find Rich Dad, Poor Dad in your local library some where...read it....but please don't waste your money to buy it!!!"
5,Great book - There are other great books too...,Great book! Another good book that helped me tremendously was the one at www.financial-planning-book.com. I wish amazon sold the book from there. It was called Best Financial Planning Book and was the absolute best book on financial planning that I've ever read. Hope that helps someone.
5,School is not the only solution,""" If you want to get rich or just know how money works, Rich dad, Poor dad gives a good example of methods you can be succesful with. I strongly recommend for any one who thinks of a way to get rich to read this book and also for the people who are or who plan to become an Entreprenuer."""
5,Eye Opener - To Accumulate Wealth,"This is great book if especially one is involved in the Rat Raceof Earning, Paying Taxes and Spending whats left, in short you never see your money accumulate or work for you.I would recommend it to everyone who really wants to be wealthy in the long run."
4,Where's a book for people who don't want to retire?,"This book offers good advice RE recognizing REAL assets and liabilities. Paradigm-shifting stuff for many, no doubt.I haven't read Millionaire Next Door, but I get the impression its author is way too frugal in his lifestyle. Have your 'Goals', but also have fun along the way!Also, I feel Kiyosaki beats-up on his real father too much. After reading RDPD, I felt very sorry for the guy.Where does Greed fit into all of this? Why should people work, work, work, for more than they personally want or need? (Perhaps that's where this early-retirement fad comes in.)Personally, I enjoy my career so much I NEVER want to retire.Perhaps I should write my own book!!! Another paradigm-shifter in the making!"
1,Rich dad broken record,"Hello. This book has way too many repeats. He tends to say the same thing over and over again page after page. He goes on about assets vs liabilities for about 15 pages in one part. After 50 pages I realized I was gaining nothing.It seemed like when he was about to tell something big, he stopped and then re-winded to a previous point he made 10 pages back and then never went forward then the next chapter would start on a brand new topic.Worthless waste of time. He made his money selling these kind of books to people. Good thing for libraries."
1,Promotion of improper way of living,"The other readers, who gave negative feedback on this book, mention that the author's advices don't work and are even illegal. However, I think that the biggest issue of this book not the advices themselves, but a promotion of sponger way of living. He clearly tells to take money from people without giving anything at all in exchange. He discourages readers to open their own companies stating that they cannot succeed, discourages to get education and do work which is useful to society. Or, to invest in third-party companies (well, he does tell to buy stocks, but only to sell it very soon for higher price). He never tell his readers to think what useful they can do. He brags how he deceives people, but this is not what somebody should be proud of.Also, the author's statement that everyone can make money this way apparently is not true. A society can bear only a small percentage of such spongers. Others have to produce values the spongers speculate."
5,A superb book for people who wants (and will) become wealthy,"I had come from a poor environment and at the age of 23, I thought I was doing well with a six figure income and a nice BMW. Now at the age of 24 I'm no better off, actually (financially) I'm worse off.Thanks to the Book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, it's opened my eyes to the financial traps that so many of us fall into. I highly recommend this book to any individual who wishes to improve their financial situtation, regardless of your background.Thanks you Robert. Hopefully, I'll be able to meet you someday."
4,Encourages reader to think outside the box,"The author encourages the reader to go further in life financially by changing his or her way of thinking about money--how to spend it, how to make it. The book is full of excellent personal experiences that the author shares to show how it is done. Be prepared to be challenged to be a better manager of your financial life!"
2,"Too Basic, Repeats itself","Written way too basic for what it sells itself to be.The first two chapters sums up the whole book. There are no, I repeat No specific detailed examples of how or what to do. Only generalizations here!"
1,"Book on How the Rich Dad, Poor Dad books make money","Another rehash of same theme. My Dad was poor so I learned to respect someone else's father. It is all about money, not values. The entire series should be renamed, how I and my friends make money selling the same book over and over again. Not better than an infomercial. How many of the millions of people who bought this book actually became rich?"
3,Worth Reading,"Although this book is not perfectly written it is worth reading. This book is based on a single key concept (easily explained in a one page summary). The author did not invent this key concept; however, the author's long winded explanation may be helpful.This book is not reference material - suggest purchasing used or reading a library copy. You will only read the book once."
1,The Dreamer's Guide to Money Loss,This is a fun read of very dangerous thinking. Check the Attorney General of Ohio's website.
1,This book is suspect,"This poorly written book is more about personal improvement than investing, but the exhortations to save more and spend less are common sense. The inconsistencies in the few examples and the lack of specifics makes one wonder about the veracity of many of the claims. The two dads story itself is hard to believe.I find myself wondering if the authors make all their money by selling books to gullible people like myself. I do not recommend this book."
2,Rich Dad got this Poor Mom to Buy His Book,"Ok, I admit I come from a Poor Dad family, a Dirt Poor Dad family, but I absolutely felt had when I bought this book. First of all, the format was like the monk giving little sparrow lessons about money. Rich Dad was a guru and the kids were his believers who were touched by an all knowing, all seeing all money-making spirit.There is nothing wrong about learning how to manage your money and keeping some of it away from predators, but he oversimplified the basic reality of our economic culture and really, I believe, insulted many people who work for a living. And what's with the charts anyway. Try giving the charts to a low income inner city single mother and see how she manages with your philosophy. After all is said and done Rich Dad got me to buy the book so I guess he has something going for him, but it didn't go for me."
3,Buy it used and form your own opinion,"This book is a good motivating tool. It gives you the sense that you don't have to be beholden to the man. On the other hand, it wont guide you on how to do that.Read the book, then read the scathing reviews of R. Kiyosaki and his connections with pyramid schemes, contradictions etc...The stories in the book are interesting, and motivational. Take the good points out of it and ignore the bad."
4,Good information,"This is a great book for information, especially for the beginner in wealth growth. The book gives excellent depiction on what is needed to start growing your wealth portfolio and how the rich get ahead and why the poor (in this case, middle class) end up without true economic growth. The only area where the book could improve is in actually giving the steps to achieve wealth and not just the info."
5,Financial Literacy 101,"The principles outlined in Rich Dad Poor Dad are blatantly obvious. Most will read this book and think to themselves: ""Duh! Of course you want to handle your monetary affairs that way!"" The fact of the matter is, however, that the vast majority of people fail to follow these few simple rules. Reading this book will cause readers to take stock of their lives, and motivate them to get their financial houses in order. Following the rules set forth here will put an end to many previously unidentified bad habits that may be draining your bank account right now. I give it five stars because it did more to steer my way of thinking towards money consciousness than anything else I've ever read."
3,Some words of wisdom,"This book was very interesting and did give me a different perspective on finances. However, it did drag at moments and took a while to get to the point. Overall, it was a good book with some interesting words of wisdom. Kiyosaki is a wise man and he did not give a specific ""thing"" to do in order to get rich, instead he tells how te rich people became wealthy and how the rich think. This book is good but a challenge to read."
3,Not Enough Substance,"I read the book and left with the impression that I had read one chapter, over and over again. The principles Kiyosaki advocates are mostly good (one exception, I'll describe below), but he offers little or no real substance--no how-to, no details. He also tends to brag about his conquests a bit too much; makes me want to hear equal time for his failures (never mentioned).The principle that I disagree with is to place properties into a corporation and then take your money out as ""expenses"". The problem is that the IRS is fully aware of this ""trick"" and nobody in his right mind would do such a thing and invoke the wrath of the ""Revenooers"". I also read ""Income for Life from Real Estate"" at about the same time and found it to be much more useful, not just a sales pitch for the author and his products. I would be interested in knowing what other readers who have read both books have to say."
1,0 star if I could select it....,"Kiyosaki is a mediocre story teller at best and an even worse financial/life adviser. I'm no expert but I suspect he suffers from multiple personality disorders. It's obvious that all the stuff he talks about his rich dad and Mike and himself are made B.S. The materials reads/sounds like as if 4(the 2-dads, Mike and him) of his multiple personalities are talking to one another and he has the insight and bravado to put it down on paper and make a fortune out of it. Someone once told me that if you package feces right, you can sell it. Kiyosaki's books are proof of that.PZ"
1,Same words over and over without saying anything,"This book is one of the worst disappointments of any reading material I have come upon in the last century. I bought this book hoping for wisdom which I assume would be revealed but instead I just got the same empty words over and over again and again and again.I think that the only failing of Poor Dad was in the raising of a son who could have such little respect for his values that ultimately may have been missed by his son.Maybe he is sincere, and out of him the benefit of the doubt, but I think I've been calmed and that this guy is making a fortune also selling books and claiming to be retired.I even watched a full hour on national public television waiting for something, I got nothing.Good luck"
1,Watch out for the IRS,"Didn't care for this book, for all the reasons listed here and more. His advice is spotty at best, and at often times crosses into the illegal category. He writes about incorporating so you can buy yourself things like cars and save on taxes (since business are taxed on income after expenses). Nothing wrong with this, except be prepared to prove that those expenses are for the business and not personal use. Unless you're spending all the time driving the ""company car"" for business purposes, its tax evasion and its illegal. This was just one example among my dislike for this book"
5,A breath of Fresh Air,"This book really helps break the standard mold we are put in when growing up. And it is a very easy read, I highly recommend it to anyone who's not enjoying the rat race... which is pretty much everyone!"
4,First you have to believe...,"In reading previous customer reviews, I agree that the author is not a ""great"" writer (Shakespeare it ain't, but then he doesn't claim to be Will). I also agree it could have been tightened up a bit, but so can many books.However, this valuable book is background for book II. It establishes Kiyosaki's ""credentials"". It tells you where he came from (and I don't mean just Hawaii), and why he believes in his philosophy. And most of all, he lets you know that you can change your thinking process and move to the right side of the financial quadrant towards financial freedom.It's a fun and fast read. He's showing us by his life example so we can see how we've been blocked. My advice, take the best, and leave the rest. It was sure worth more than it cost to me. You will see yourself in it. After all, how were you brainwashed about money when you were growing up?"
1,Investing in authors retirement,"Many years ago I've read a cartoon where Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge suggests how to make a million: Write a book ""How to make a million"".How many people who've read this book became millionaires?There is hardly any specific information, what you read you may already know about assets. And then suddenly ""I am rich""; are there any details that tell you how he became rich?And he suggests to buy his next book or game, and next and next. The author has flooded the market with his products: books, games, CDs, DVDs.There is saying ""With more turkeys the soup will be tastier""."
2,This book is a bad idea...,"On the surface this book can capture the heart of most dreamers as he makes it sound all so easy- unfortunately, this book was built on lies, as many of the other reviews reveal. It is full of contradictions, and the deals discussed in this book never happened. Why should you trust what he says about getting rich when he is dishonest and hasn't done those very things? The good part about the book is that it gets you thinking about the fact that there is a way to be rich and it isn't the way of the middle class- but you had better search for other reading on the subject to find realistic and practical ways for you to get there.P.S. There is no real ""Rich Dad"" as the book leads on."
2,Not for the average guy or girl,"After getting through all the fluff Rich Dad is basically for people who want to embark in a career in real estate or their own business. It can work, but it is not a realistic approach for the average guy or girl who want's to have more money over time. This is more like a get rich quick idea then common sense on living below your means and investing small amounts over time. He kind of looks down on us regular folks who don't want to flip houses or take those kind of risks in real estate. Their are some good ideas in this book and some motivational stories too, but as a realistic approach on retiring with dignity, don't bother. If you want to go out on your own and take a chance, then it will be a worth while read, but if you want a common sense approach on investing, buy the Automatic Millionaire instead."
1,"This ""dreamstealer"" re-read the book....","..and I stick by my original review. I noticed a lot of Amway/Quixtar jargon in the 5-star reviews.5%, rat race, rut, stinkin' thinkin', go-to-school-get-a-good-job myth, just to name a few (wow, so original)If you want to use this book for motivation, that's OK, I would think people would want hard facts to back up the author's claims of riches (oops, forgot, facts don't count). The attacks on 1-star reviews by MLM'ers are very tired and predictable from those who are desperately hoping their ""business"" will make them millionaires.This book does give good basics (spend less than you make, asset/liabilites) but any financial book will give you that.BTW - all my former ""retired"" uplines now have J-J-J-JOBS to support their ""interactive distribution"" business'."
2,Very little content.,"After reading this book, it became very apparent that Mr. Kiyosaki has little to offer in the way of financial advice. For the most part, this book does nothing but offer tales of Mr. Kiyosaki's successful financial ventures and worthless cliches (i.e Pay yourself first!).The author has provided virtually no details on how to build wealth nor has he discussed any behavioural issues which contribute to many peoples poor financial situations to begin with.This book is useless and possibly even dangerous!"
2,It's probably worth $9 or $10,"If you can get past the incredibly poor writing style, the author does have a few good points to make. Good literature is probably not what you're seeking when you buy this book (and you certainly won't get it). I do, however, think it is worth $9.**, if you can't borrow it at a library. The author provides a different way of approaching finances-- an approach that was helpful for me. At times, it seemed to me that some of his best point were straight out of some of the other books to which he refers."
4,"Good easy reading, however it wasn't as 'out of this world as I was expecting",It had some excellent examples. And some revealing insights into our working lives and the rat race we run. The book was shorter than I expected and not as much educational info as I wouild have hoped.It did seem very much like Sharon was trying to somehow link all his thoughts noted down over the years into some form of flowing narrative. A basic starting point to discovering a new psychology but you'll need other books that will educate you further into going from being an everyday employee to what his rich dad was.
5,"A great book, it shows the difference it attitudes...","I enjoyed this book.I come from a lower-middle class background and hope to succeed financially.My mother, to this day, has the ""poor dad"" mentality, even after I sent her this book. Now she says, ""It's too late..."", ""I'm too old..."", ""I don't know how to...""Her money does not earn any interest in her checking account.She refuses to take any risk or try expanding her finances."
3,Disappointed,"I was surprised by this product. When it arrived, I was disappointed to learn that it is a miniature book. It has good information but is so very condensed."
1,"Great Marketing, Worthless book","This is 1 of the most worthless financial books I have ever read. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I can tell you the jist of what he says : Have assets not liabilites (duh...). Your house is a liability not an asset. Evidently, to learn some ways you can accumulate all those assets you have to buy his OTHER books!!!Although he mentions that the rich incorporate themselves, he does not go into how one does this, why, what it does for you, & any reasons why you should not.This book is like 1 of those TV get-rich infomercials where they keep saying ""this system will get you rich"". We watch the whole thing because we keep thinking they will mention HOW. It is nothing but a commercial to buy the book,system,seminar,etc.I read this whole book for the same reason - thinking he would eventually get to the HOWs. But he never does. Any coincidence he is a prince of infomercials?"
1,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","The author provides great concepts on what it takes to build wealth, but scant little in the way of details about how to implement them. Repeated references to the author's lectures, seminars, and educational board games throughout the book are obvious invitations to fork over additional cash in order to get the details.The same few golden rules provided to build wealth are repeated over and over throughout the book. After the first couple of chapters the book provides nothing new, just a rehashing of the same concepts. Just like a television infomercial, but in print."
5,Rich Dad Poor Dad,Product arrived quickly and was in excellant shape.Would definitely order from there again.
4,We can learn from this book!,"Having just readPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Too,I was keen to read this book to keep the momentum going . I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by Kiyosaki is really good. The principles espoused by RTK in his first of the Rich Dad series are fabulous if only you will open your mind to new information. These books will take you to where you want to go financially. I highly recommend this book."
4,Good; lack substance,"This is a good and informative book; however, there wasn't as much substance to what the author wrote or his examples were not always clear. The ideas were very helpful and does bring insight to how one should view finances. I would recommend this book."
1,Totally Useless for Me,"I read this book after receiving a couple of recommendations from friends. Boy, what a disappointment. This is the most poorly written book I have read in a long time! It contains nothing but the author's self serving stories and few really bad pieces of advice. Seriously, I don't see how this book can have such a high rating unless Kyosaki is rating his own book under false names.If you are serious about investing and about achieving financial independence, save your money and read a SERIOUS book."
2,not much value,"I fail to understand all the praise for this book. All of his books make just one basic point ""you should let your money work for you by investing wisely, don't just rely on your salary"". Do you need to read 200 page books to understand this point? There is no practical actionable advice for the novice investor, just oft repeated principles reiterated many times using his rich dad.Another thing that is irritating is the fact that he keeps repeating one and the same thing like going to school is not very useful etc.You wil learn a lot more about investing from other more focused books and websites like motley fool, morning star etc. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Perhaps the best example of the worst of this genre!,"The most disturbing thing about this book was what appeared to me to be a spirit of meanness and an attitude of downright contempt toward his real father for being poor. In addition, I don't think the useful concepts are well explained or in other cases completely explained. Overall, I think this book is a poor oversimplification of the wealth process that has probably done more harm than good. If you want something that is more edifying, but still fairly simple with some useful straightforward advice try ""Secrets of the Millionaire Mind"" by Eker. I'm also sure you will find many other useful titles scattered throughout other reviews of this book. I actually got a bit physically ill when I read this book, which sums up my overall opinion of this author's work."
4,Make your own decision,"A great book to inspire you to make changes. Its also great for motivation. Worth a read, but make your own decisions about investing. Perhaps get some runs on the board investing rather than quitting your job, as I want to do each time i read it."
3,I like it but..,"I like it, gave me a few tips and ideas about money management n how I should spend my money... But since he filed a fraud bankruptcy I don't know if I should trust his words.."
5,very good basic start for the understanding of financial success,"this is a basic s starter book a in the whole series for this, author. lots of Stories wrapped up with lessons on how to start a solid financial life. It w was a no putdown for me. Read straight through and reading it again for the lessons. Makes a lot of sense what he is saying."
1,Wrong book!,"The book took about 3 weeks to get here and when it finally arrived, it wasn't even the right order. Very disappointed. Zero stars if it were possible."
1,Hot Air,"i am still thinking about the riches that jesus preached to the world: ""a few fishes and a few loaves of bread are enough to feed the world.""when i saw an article about ""planning for retirement,"" in my churches bulletin, and it used dollar signs to denote bullet items, i thought: ""what is this world coming too."" this book is about putting dollar signs in bulletins.neither rich dads nor poor dads will be able to stop the devistation of the rain forests, reduce the impact of oil spills, nor keep our garbadge from pilling up in landfills.neither rich dads nor poor dads will rise to the level of mother theresa's loving embrace of the world, unless they give themselves freely to the world like mother theresa.while the book tells you how to play the game, it certainly doesnt seem to say much about much.i stayed rich by reading the book in the library and leaving it there. that follows the advice of the book which suggests that you keep your money, accumulate more, and dont spend it."
1,whatever,Save your money. If the author really cared about the financial responsibility of readers he would reccomend for them to save their money and not buy his book.
2,Read Dr. Stanley instead,"This book is almost an entire contrast to the MUCH BETTER BOOK The Millionaire Next Door by Tom Stanley. How on earth can Mr. Kiyosaki imply that people should wait to buy a house until they can pay cash?? Who can actually do this? Also, he implies that a college education is not important in order to achieve wealth. Does he know that Dr. Stanley has done the research and has shown that less than 25% of all millionaires in the U.S. do not have 4 year degrees? The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star is because I agreed with him on the importance of cashflow from investments. Stick to Stanley, he has actually done the research."
1,One of the Worst Books I Have Read,"""Rich Dad"" is one of the worst books I have ever read. If you are not a member of the Kyosaki cult and care to know why, read on.My beef with this book is that it doesn't do what it claims to do. There is very little advice and information in this book. It does NOT tell you what the ""rich tell their kids"", it does not give you a roadmap or even well structured ideas as to what you need to do to put yourself on the road to financial well being. All I was able to get out of the book are some general statements that things will go well if I invest. Invest in what? Invest how? Kyosaki's boastful stories, which are liberally used throughout the book, do very little to provide any real information.This is not the book that I was looking for, and I suspect that it is not the one you want either.Try instead ""Smart Couples Finish Rich"". Now that's a book that has something real to say. Enjoy."
1,There is no secret formula to wealth.,"There is no secret formula to wealth, but that's what the author implies. I have a JD/MBA and I am an entrepreneur owning several businesses. Obviously, i have learned a great deal from books, but this book is an outrage. From its offensive title to the insipid dribble he feeds us for 200 pgs, Kiyosaki fails to say anything. He has become fabulously wealthy by duping us into spending $12 of our hard-earned cash to tell us things that are trite (most of the book), misleading (our house is not an asset), or wrong (taxes punishes the wealthy). Howard Schulz, Jack Welsh, and Sam Walton all had poor dads who taught them one thing-- hard work, dedication, and passion are the keys to success. Please, if you want to read this book, CHECK IT OUT FROM THE LIBRARY!!!! and read it critically. Don't let him fool you too."
1,repulsive,"What a waste of time. This book is suggested by Quixstar/Amway types, need I say more. Kiosaki does not give any relevant information at all. This book will be viewed as great by people that mindlessly go about reading and are not too astute on business and the economy. His one sentence advice (buy low sell high type stuff) is thoughtless and he seems like a shady type."
1,Not a practical book. Making more money selling the book.,"I believe he is making more money selling the book than doing what he explain on the book.Vague Ideas, ""look neat ideas"" in paper but not that good on practice.It contradict itself in one part. It said in the middle of the book if you have few eggs to be brave and put it all in one basquet instead of few eggs on different basquets.At the end of the book he said that you have to keep your eggs on different baskets.I fo not think all the realism that is on the book. I read he has 4 employments. The last one was in Xerox company. From there he build up a his empire and while he was still working at Xerox he bought a Porche.I heard his cashflow books and he said he was dead broke for many years. Where fit this time frame on the first book?I think he made or exagerate some of his stories and the best income are from the Intellectual property of the books.As he said it in the book. ""Its not well written, but it sells by the tittle he put in it"""
1,"Mr. Kiyosaki is rich b/c of his books, not b/c of his wisdom",Worst financial book I have ever read. This book should be used for HS kids. I found it funny how Mr Kiyosaki claims he paid 3.5 million for his house...yet the tax records show it was nearly 1/3 of that. You would be better to buy 1 share of stock...at least you have potential to get your money back. HAHA! Seriously...Don't buy this book.
1,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad only makes Dad rich","Rich Dad, Poor Dad has a catchy title and a compelling premise, but it is one of the most poorly written manuscripts I've ever seen published. It is replete with page after page of grammatical errors that good high school students would be embarrassed to make. (See page 59 for instance.) It desperately needs an editor to tame the rambling prose. Mr. Kiyosaki advises his readers--when they wade into areas where they are uninformed--to hire competent professionals. He should have taken his own advice and paid someone to edit his work. I returned this book in disgust after reading 60 pages. Don't contribute to making Mr. Kiyosaki a Rich Dad. He hasn't earned either your attention or your money."
4,Funny how many people react to this book!!,"I find it very funny how many people react to this book (based on a couple of the reviews I read). There is nothing on the book's cover that says buy this book and become rich. I think the purpose of this book, which does pretty effectively, is to give you a mind set for financial freedom, not to give you a plugin formula that will make you rich in 3 days. I liked the book and gives you a different perspective to achieving financial freedom. If you are looking for a book with a step by step to becoming rich, look elsewhere and if you find it, I want to be the firt one to hear about it."
2,"For most people, there are better places to spend your money","I received this book as a (wanted) gift. The anecdotal writing style was enjoyable at first but became a little tiresome when stories and ideas were repeated. Although it claims to be written to help most people get out of the ""poor"" person's mentality, it won't really provide the drive, methods, and information people would need over the long term.If you have the type of personality that has an abundance of initiative, fearlessness, ambition and focus, this book provides some philosophical--and fewer practical--points to incorporate into your climb to the top. It is never stated outright, but this book is definitely geared toward those in society who equate success with money and power; the best thing a dad can do for his son is to be rich.Bottom line: better to rent (from the library) than to own"
3,Give it a B minus,"The short and to the point review of this book is it is basically a financial philosophy outline. I found no specific formulas, but I found an impressive attitude and mind frame for success.I highlighted 14 specific ideas. Heres the top 3. 1.Investment risk is always reduced if you love what u r investing in, understand it and know the game.2.Wize business is working with and hiring individuals who are more intelligent than yourself.3.Corporations are one of the biggest secrets of the rich.I think if the book had more specific guidlines for accumilating wealth I would have rated it higher."
4,A Good Book for Beginners,"This is a great beginners book, it provides the groundwork, but it doesn't go deep enough. It would have been helpful if the authors, one of whom had an accounting background, provided some pointers for folks who need the basic how-to's of financial planning and management."
3,Selling tool?,"It was a good read, but I wonder if it was just a tool to help sell his RDPD programs."
2,rich dad,bought this book for some one else. I've read in the past and recommend it to all college students to read and alert them to whats waiting for them in the world.
4,Very good!,"Very good audio book, however it seems like a NEW take on ""Richest Man in Babylon"". Still good information and great insight."
1,I've certainly read better,"The author states in the book that he's a terrible writer, but he sells a lot of books. He's quite correct, unfortunately. This book takes about 160 pages to say what could be summarized in a few paragraphs. Save money, try to stay out of debt, invest your savings for the long run in assets that will appreciate in value and eventually generate income for you. All good advice, but The Millionaire Next Door was much more readable and practical. I also like Eight Steps to Seven Figures. For that matter the Motley Fool website is outstanding for common sense personal finance. All would be better uses of your time than reading this. This book gives no hands on advice about anything. For example, let's say you have no assets, a pile of debt etc. How do you change that? This book says ""use your mind"". That's nice but some real solid advice would certainly be preferable in my opinion."
5,Is Your House Your Biggest Asset? Think Again!,"I recently attended a lecture by Robert Kiyosaki, and subsequently ordered this book. Robert Kiyosaki impressed me as having an incredible ability to clearly communicate the basics of money. This book was not written by an investment advisor who preaches about the theories of economics and finance but has never really mastered them him/herself; rather, this is a person who has used his practical philosophies to create a sizeable economic base. He speaks to the average person in average language but communicates volumes in doing so. He concentrates not on techniques, but on the understanding of money. After having read this book, I ordered three more books to give to friends and business associates. I highly recommend this book to everybody, regardless of age, level of wealth or social background. It's a very easy, enjoyable read!"
1,Quixtar/Amway/BWW Propoganda,"Im a finance major, and I work for a leading investment broker. I would like to think I know a little about financial management. Some stranger came up to me in a bookstore and was telling me about this book. Long story short, he was with some Quixtar/Amway variation. This book is motivational fluff. In Kiyosaki's other book, Prophecy, he states that 401(k)'s are a scam and some idiotic stock market crash is coming to wipe out everyone's retirement. Funny how none of my finance professors ever heard of this. If you want to beleive this nonsense, go ahead. You deserve whatever happens."
4,I only wish the book was written years ago.,"Mr. Kiyosaki explains the problems with our society's current paradyms of money, success and creating wealth. How we are currently in the ""Rat Race"" and do not know how to break out of the race.Once I started reading this book at the local bookshop I couldn't put it down, so I bought it. I was amazed at how simple Robert's principles are, they are things that everyone is capable of seeing through to the end. The entire book is summed up by ""the No 1 rule, the only rule"". I now look at my possessions in a different light that is worthless devaluing pieces of junk. Robert not only tells the reader what he/she should be spending their hard earned cash on but how to do it.The book is very user friendly. I felt as if I was talking to Robert on a one to one basis. After reading this book you will become an authority on its teachings."
3,"Solid Ideas, with an Occassional Extreme View Thrown In","Good, solid ideas, with a refreshing definition of ""assets."" My only caution is that Kiyosaki's recommendation to eschew traditional investments in favor of more aggressive (i.e., speculative) investments may hurt those just starting out. (Granted, Kiyosaki warns readers that they need to educate themselves first, I just wonder if readers will take it to heart, or jump into speculative waters in their exuberance.)I disagree with assessments that this is a get-rich-quick book. It took Kiyosaki to age 47 before he ""retired,"" and he was working at it most of his life. Not exactly a get-rich-quick scheme. But that's what I like about the book--it's realistic. Just apply some common sense and follow Kiyosaki's advice to educate yourself before you risk your life's savings on a ""killer deal."""
1,Very dangerous,"This book is something Written by a salesman, not an investor: Robert kiyosaki has little knowledge about how investing actually works, and so his advice is EXTREMELY misleading and dangerous: he ignores important factors such as risk, and basically tells you that it's good to be broke so you can learn from it?!? This was the first book I ever read on investing, at about 16 years of age, and I have to tell you, go read something else. This man has a bad economic background, and the only way he ever made money was by selling people books about making money. It's just a big scam. His other books are the same. Please go look for real advising from the pros."
4,Corporate versus Entrepreneurial Thinking,The book is a quick read on how to change your thinking from the corporate/blue collar view to the entrepreneurial view. It is elementary on several points but mind blowing on others - it depends on where you're at in life. I found it to be very interesting; it changed my thought process on how to go about making money and what that really means. Buyer beware: the book is approximately two inches square.
1,Waste of Money & Time to Read....,"Yes, I was talked into buying this book a while ago into thinking that it provided all the answers that I needed to become like the author. Well, after reading this book, I did a little researched to see what the author preached in his book was actually the same advice that he took in his financial life. To my surprise, the author made more money selling books, training conferences, talk shows than his financial portfolio. If you don't believe me then try to find him on Google and you will uncover the truth about this author."
1,Upside down & backwards,"This book has it upside down and backwards. The ""Poor Dad"" was actually the ""Rich"" one by valueing things such as education, family, self-sacrifice & integrity. The me-first/get-rich-quick priorities of the ""Rich Dad"" are less helpful."
3,FOR THE JUNIOR TO BE (IN COLLEGE),"I SELECT THIS TITLE BASICALLY BECAUSE THE JUNIOR IN COLLEGE IS USUALLY PLANNING... IT'S A GOOD BOOK IN THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE INSIGHT TO THOSE THAT ""ARE IN COLLEGE"", ARE LOOKING TOWARDS THEIR FUTURE AND A FUNDAMENTAL AVENUE ON HOW TO PLAN THEIR FINANCES BEFORE THAT DAY ARRIVES. IT'S THE AUTHORS OPINION AS TO WHETHER COLLEGE IS NEEDED. I BELIEVE HE FEELS IT'S BEST BUT TRIES TO GET THROUGH TO THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE A COLLEGE EDUCATION THAT THEY CAN ALSO SUCCEED-IT'S NOT THE END. I CAN SEE HOW SOME MAY MISCONTRUE THE AUTHOR'S CONCEPT OF DEMPHASIZING EDUCATION. BASICALLY, INVEST WHAT YOU CAN. ROLL IT OVER TO EITHER BETTER FUNDS OR ACQUIRE A GOOD DEAL ON A REAL ESTATE. ROLL THAT OVER INTO A BETTER DEAL. YOU CAN USE HIS METHOD TO GAIN ""THE SPOILS OF LIFE"" AND NOT PAY OUTRIGHT. OR YOU CAN JUST BUY THAT CAR OUTRIGHT AND WAIT THAT MUCH LONGER TO BEGIN YOUR INVESTING DAYS. HE'S RIGHT. THE BOOK WAS OK. NOT GREAT."
1,"Reading is Good, but TAKE ACTIONS","I gave one star to have attentions ^__^.. this book is worth knowledge of changing people mind set and seeing the other world that they are in. After you read this book, you must take actions in order for you to become a next billionerPractice, practice, and practiceGBU..."
3,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","Although Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki was extremely repetative, he conveyed very useful information regarding ways in which your money can actually work for you. This book passes on the knowledge that cannot be attained from a school education and can make the difference between living a middle class life or a lavish one. It is a good step in the right direction to gain motivation and useful tactics for securing a stable future and becoming wealthy. This book can be helpful for those without any previous knowledge in the business field"
3,Kiyosaki likes to talkie!,"Although Kiyosaki had some very key points on how to manage your money, he came off as repeatitive when trying to unnecessarily reiterate some of his focuses. This book could have been written in 40 pages, but instead Kiyosaki decided to stretch it out for the sake of quantity rather than for a condensed interesting content. After reading the six lessons, the reader could put down the book and have gained almost as much information as someone who kept on reading. This would have been a much better read if Kiyosaki had stopped while he was ahead instead of adding more chapters."
2,What's all the fuss about this book?,"This book might have been useful a few years ago when we were still in the midst of a real estate and stock market bubble, but sort of dated today after the bubble has clearly burst. The author boasts of investing in small speculative stocks, the types of investments that have cost American investors trillions of dollars in capital losses from the recent stock market secular bear market we find ourselves in.Following this type of investment advice in the current economic environment might take you out of the middle class and on to the welfare line. Maybe pick it up again in 10 years when it will be safe again to invest in securities and probably deflated real estate environment.The most interesting tidbit from the book is the authors point of view that buying an expensive home that's beyond ones means is a liability rather than an asset."
5,A great first step,This book is a great first lesson in along the path of thinking and living financially independant. To some Kiyosaki's points may seem somewhat basic but most often a reexamination of these basics reveals things that you always knew you should have been doing but just never had time. Its a great first step in gaining the focus and balance required to make set a long term executatable financial plan. I'd recommend some just like this as a first step in the right direction.
3,A good storyteller,"I have heard Mr Kiyosaki speak, and I find him to be an interesting raconteur. Indeed, this book is full of great anecdotes, but I was hoping for much more detailed advice than what I got.This is a book geared at the American market. It contains a lot of investment and tax details applicable only to Americans, not for those from other continents like myself. For example, although it sounds very impressive, I have no idea what a 1031 tax deferred exchange is - or what it is supposed to achieve. Surely where instances of these terms occur, a re-write could have been done explaining the equivalents in other countries. At the very least, a glossary could have been included.This is fundamentally a very interesting book. It has sold millions of copies around the world, and I have one of them. My criticisms are few, but I do believe that it would be a better book if a few amendments were made."
3,"Basic wisdoms, eye-opener, yet not too profound",Important book for people with no clue about money and wealth. Very basic ideas laid out in an easily readable form. These ideas should be general knowledge for anyone living in the capitalistic world.
1,"Bad, bad, bad advice",Our brother is now facing foreclosure and the loss of everything including his wife and children because of this book. This is a book that recommends taking all the equity out of your house to invest and denigrates working for a living and saving. It goes against everything our parents taught us.
3,"It's good, but that's about it.","It's a good book and gets you thinking, but a lot of these reviews confirmed what came to my mind reading it about how he's so vague about things, his hinting toward insider trading. Maybe I'm the only one who noticed this, but doesn't he seem to have quite the vocabulary and education when asking and rephrasing what his rich dad was asking him when he was only nine years old?!?!?! Some of the things he's supposedly saying (and even recalling from nine years of age) is absurd. I'm only 27 and all I remember from being nine was the third grade and a couple of friends where I used to live. I couldn't tell you or recall one thing I ever said to anyone or what they said to me. It's too far fetched. I'm glad I'm finding that other stuff is being discovered that he made up, such as his multi-person rich dad and how vague he is when asked about this book. Thank you for the other reviews everyone!"
3,Haven't read.,Have heard about the book and decided to read it but have not yet. Can't review something I haven't read.
4,Rich Dad,Good book but may not apply as much in todays markeet. Hope it doesnt make some readers do something silly with their money as it doesnt warn you much in that respect. But lessons can be applied to other areas in your life.
3,Good for inspiration,"This book really helped me ""focus"" on the idea of building wealth and focusing on financing. But this book is largely about mentality and not practical wisdom. Still, well worth the price."
2,Very basic and repetitive,"This book will be good for young adults or maybe older readers who are really financially challenged. The easy and straightforward nature of the book (repeats points many times, and is veeery basic) may speak straight to these people, and give them the proper mindset.those who are looking for a book on finance, it will give you very little. this book is in fact for everyone else."
5,Happy Valentines Day Rich Dad!,"Following the principles in Rich Dad Poor Dad has changed my life in under one year. This advice really works! I wholheartily recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad evenif it is the only personal finance book you ever read.Rich Dad Poor Dad is not a great book, it is an outstandingly great book. It is the one book that you must have.Thanks again Robert T. and Happy Valentines Day!"
4,"Pretty good, but read with scepticism","I'm a sceptical reader. There are details that I suspect are embellished here, a few mistakes, and there is some vagueness in the recommendations in the last half of the book, but the first half of the book is inspirational and the second half at least provides enough hints to give you ideas to investigate yourself. Overall, I'd say it's a pretty good book. I've bought copies for many of my friends while warning to maintain their scepticism."
3,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"Rich Dad Poor Dad contains some practical ideas about building wealth. There certainly is a need for the principles of money management to be taught at home beginning at an early age.Some of the author's criticism of our educational system might be overcome if everyone took at least one college-level business course as part of their educational program. In addition, I do not know one member of the business faculty where I work who teaches students that guaranteed job security is an end result of education.Since this book was written before the stock market ""correction"", I am curious to know how the author fared with a lack of diversification in his stock portfolio."
3,"I laughed, I cried. Where's the beef?","A new panacea, maybe not. Robert does bring some good thoughts out and does challenge one to think. I was a little disappointed to learn/not learn any specifics or true depth. He glosses over many things. Over all, I would recommend the book for the thought provocation ... not the sales pitch. After all, if he is RICH and RETIRED, why doesn't he teach us all for free ..... like ""Dad"" did for him?"
1,Not helpful at all..,"This book is full of stories that tell you the same message, over and over again. We get the point, give us some practical tips and steps to achieve the goals. I did not find the book helpful at all, I learned very little in terms of practical financial knowlege. The first chapter got the message across, the rest are just fillers. I found David Bach's Automatic Millioniare and other books in his series much more useful."
2,"Interesting, but the author is a jag","Although I found a lot of this material of interest, the author had a way of presenting it in a manner that was offensive in nature. Continually he made it sound as if the middle class were stupid for living their lives the way they do. he made huge assumptions that everyone in the world has made any effort to be wealthy. It was hard to get past his sheer arrogance.I would be hesitant to recommend this book since the info revealed was skimpy. Mostly he talked about his his rich father badmouthed his poor father for getting an education and contributing to society."
2,How many people who actually read this book become rich?,"While I found the stories appealing at first, if you dig deeper into the book the message becomes evident: ""You too can become rich with these simple techniques."" In this sense it is no better than a get rich quick infomercial. The sad truth if there was such a simple formula to making money, everyone would do it. Just keep this in mind while reading or considering the purchase of these types of books."
2,"Bad Book, Boring Book","First I hate people who are taken with themselves...I felt like I was watching an infomercial at 11pm when I read this. You know, the guy who talks too fast, too loud and sounds like he's 'gonna make ya swim wid da fishes' if you don't do what he says.Very contradictory with his opinions on education. On one page he says its no good and he has no use for it and on the next he says how important it is.In summary this is a book that spouts real estate leveraging. Nothing more. It is a simple concept but not for everyone. I get the feeling that if I don't make millions the way this guy did I should resign as a respectable human and eat my meals out of a dumpster.Don't waste your money. Lucky it was 30% off. At least that made me feel like I was buying into this guys mentality."
5,think agaisnt the grain,I thought this was the best book i have ever read. I feel this book is for only the very open minded that really really want to become RICH. Not credit card in debt rich but rich. I dont think this book is for everyone only the poeple the poeple that really understand life and how poeple and socity really work. People work for money. This book tells that and how poeple that are rich let money work them. If you dont understand the last two sentences then dont but this book if you do understand the sentences then you MUST buy this book.
4,Good Advice From Good 'ol Dad,"Financial and personal discipline, along with boosting the reader's financial IQ, are the major themes in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Readers may be distracted by the relationship ""issues"" running through this otherwise excellent book. I'm not sure if Kiyosaki is intentionally tapping into the emotional maze of the father-daughter/father-son relationship to get his financial lessons across. These relationships are naturally fraught with misunderstandings and frustrations; not the least of which involve financial matters. (And what if your father qualifies as both a ""rich"" Dad and a ""poor"" Dad?) That aside, I found the lessons to be informative, practical, and motivating. I look forward to reading others in the series."
3,"Good, but not great","A ""so-so"" book - good title and intro, but I learned more from the ""Wealthy Barber"" book."
3,People who think like my mom should read it,"My mom believes in going to school, and getting a good job is the only way to live life, the complete opposite of what Robert T. Kiyosaki's point was. I also agree with him, but I just think that the book wasn't all that pleasnt to read. I mean it wasn't all that bad, but many things were repetitive. He doesn't fully explain in depth the points he is trying to convey. I still don't know the difference between an asset and a liability. Most of the things he was talking about wasn't really catching my eye, only becaue the subject of finances isn't all that interesting to me. But overall, I think that people who believe that in life, one needs to work for money, might change their views after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad."
4,a pretty good book,"this is a good book. at times it can be repetitive, but it is just trying to drive the point home. overall, it can be very eduacational if taken the right why. reading this book makes it seem very simple to make lots of money. but there is no real way to know unless you try it. i liked this book, but i personally wouldn't completely follow all of his advice. i would definately recommend following some of it, but while still keeping your day job."
3,you might wanna' think twice about this one...,"It's not even that the book itself is not that good, but more or less, all it's really gonna' tell you is to acquire ""as many assets as possible, with as few liabilities as possible"" only through a series of stories, examples, and longwinding explanations of the world that at times seem so abstract your not even sure if this guy lives in the same world as you. I guess it's a Hawaiian thing, but then again, so is pinapple on Pizza. Bottom line, what I said in 11 words, he's gonna' tell you in about 10,000, and my advice was free, where as if you order off this website, it's going to cost you a lot more than it is worth, so just take it from me...assets not liabilities, and read something else...I hear the emperor's of chocalate isn't bad!"
2,Kiyosaki takes advantage of the gullible,"Books like this bother me, because individuals like Kiyosaki make their money off of convincing anyone that he/she has the ability to become rich through some relatively simple actions and decisions. All that is necessarily to topple the house of cards, however, is to be aware of the fact that most people in society will always need to work jobs that cause them to be in the poor/middle class.Another element that is very deceptive is Kiyosaki's investment advice. Anyone who actually knows about finance also knows that there's no easy way to make money in the market; if there was, 99.9% of the time it would have been traded away by investors and institutions with access to far more resources than yourself.As is the case in many aspects of life, if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Instead of listening to charlatans like Kiyosaki, learn a useful skill and read some actual textbooks about finance/investing."
2,so so book would not recommend,"I found this book very negative and not helpful. He talks about how going to school and working hard being a waste of time. What about those people who enjoy the possibility of a career and being a master in their field? Yes, many of us want to be rich, but please do not bash those who went to school and are very proud of their accomplishments. The author's dad was a teacher, a very honored career, yet he bashes his real dad constantly through the book. I had a migraine half way through the book and could not finish it."
5,Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Tech Their Kids about Money that the Poor and the Middle Class do not!,"This is excellent audio book for both individuals and families to learn from. The audio book is good for people on the go and don't much time to read. I enjoyed Robert's plain talk on what he learned from both his ""Rich"" and ""Poor"" Dads. I look forward to reading (listening) to other books by Robert.Thanks,Simon Pena"
2,Average at best.,"I found this book to be a very easy read. The narrative was interesting, but the book lacked any sort of substance. There is not enough information in this series of books to take any action. Add some specifics and this book would be OK."
3,I like it,"I first began to like this book when I realized the authors share my philosophy of overcoming 'stalled' thinking. There is an excellent chapter on stalls related to fears of losing money, behaving differently than others, and so forth that most people have about money. The stallbusting advice is sound. In fact, this is probably the best chapter in the book. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."
4,Very good book...,"This book is great. But it is about ideas. It is about changing the way that you think about money, investing, and debt. It will not make you rich. Kiyosaki does not give you a formula or specific sequence of steps to become rich, but he is helping the common person (like me) get away from being only seen as a consumer. The idea that most helped me was the notion that your home is not an asset. He is not stating that you should not purchase a home, but he wants us to get away from the idea that when we get a raise or better paying job, we should puchase a new, more expensive house to get a tax break. A house is not an asset. It does not put money in your pocket if you had no other source of income.The book is a quick read and has good ideas."
3,"My HUMBLE Opinion, that isn't so Humble","This book is a huge dissapointment. Kiyosaki and Lechter managed to waste about a week of my time. This book is 207 pages long. 204 pages of it is not worth reading. What I should have done, is just read the titles of all the chapters, I would've learned just as much. I really regret buying, reading, and ever even hearing about this book. In fact I have some far better business advice to offer everyone out there.... SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! The only thing this book will do for you is make you 15 dollars poorer."
3,Reed vs. Kiyosaki,"This book gets 5 stars for being inspirational and 0 stars for financial advice. Read it as you'd read all books, with doubt.John T Reed, another successful individual, provides a critial response to rich dad, poor dad here ...I just wished every book came with a critique."
3,Obvious knowledge,"If you don't know anything about handling money, buy it.If you have decent knowledge of how money and an economy works this book is useless.It teaches you a certain approach towards handling money with no guarantees. I hate to say it but I think he makes more money with his books than as an investor."
4,Teach your kids before it is too late,"This is a great look at how we should teach our kids about money. We grew up with depression age parents who were always worried about every penny, but did not always save and invest. I would like to recommend another book. The Intersection of Joy and MOney. The author brings you right to the core of why you have problems with money and that these issues began in childhood. Get the Intersection book and resolve your money issues before you pass them to your kids."
5,LIFECHANGING,"I have accidently come across this book few months ago... and I must say that it totally chnaged my life and I recommend it to EVERYONE. I am more of a spiritual/ knowledge type person and business/enterpreneurship have never interested me AT ALL, but I would have a lot of problems without this book. It will you a clear idea how money works and how to make them work for you. Most of all how not to work 24/7 and still be in depth. I said to myslef( I am 23) that I never ever want to work like my parents. Woring nearly day and night for someone else and never having enough and never felt that they have enough. I am a university student and started to read this book for the second time, bought the one for young people for my little sister and I would put it to the recommened reading to secondary/ high school for sure. Amazing book that totally changed my life :)"
1,"A bad joke, and bad advice","I read this book in 2004, and there's very little good advice here. Kiyosaki tells people what they want to hear ---- and he makes real estate investing sound easier than it actually is. There is a web page by John Reed that denounces this book, please read it before spending money on this garbage. If you want to ready a good book about investing, try ""The Millionaire Next Door"" instead."
3,If you want your kids to have other options - read the book.,"I took this book at face value. That is, I thought it was a primer on how to change your thinking on the subject of investing and the historically (as the author feels) incorrect way most parents push their kids through college to get a degree. After reading it, I felt that it was lacking concrete methods of obtaining real wealth. His example of real estate investment seemed to be too good to be true.All in all, I did rethink the rote speech I was spouting off to my kids and offered them other options for their future. Which as he stresses over and over is heavily shaped by parents.I think it's especially meaningful for people that have been told that they must follow a certain formula in order to be ""successful"". School + degree = success, is not the case anymore."
2,Good book to skim through - Ignore Paid Supporters,"Was looking around the Internet for reviews on this book, and I found it interesting that I found the same review below (entitled: ""I should have bought this 10 years ago..."") on three other sites.Take the 5-Star reviews accompanied with subject lines you'd normally seen in your junk email with a grain of salt."
1,Much Blather - Little Info,"I've never quite seen someone who can fill over 150 pages with near useless drivel. Mr. Kiyosaki, goes on rabbit trails and is simply a salesman. I don't believe he knows very much about what he is talking about, and chooses to speak in generalities rather than specifics. You will walk away from this book a bit poorer in both time and money. If you're needing concrete investment strategy and facts, then look elsewhere."
1,Too much talk - not enough facts,"I normally try to be positive and find the best in things. But this book is a waste of time, considering the many good investment books out there. It has a few valuable points, but they could be stated on one page. To the authors defence, I am in favor of books that cut to the bone and I really hate having to read hundreds of pages of nothing, to get his point.If you are a first time reader of this kind of topic, the book is okay. As long as you understand that it will wont give you any tools - just rough guidelines.I, unfortunately, also listen to the audiotape. Its even worse."
3,"Roch Dad, Poor Dad","Item shipped timely and received in great condition. Book was only about 2""X 2"". Expected a larger version."
3,"Review for Rich Dad, Poor Dad","I'm not pleased with my purchase. I essentially got what I paid for, but I thought I was buying a standard version of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I think the product should have been more clearly labeled as an ABRIDGED version, since that is not what I searched for. The product arrived quickly, in new condition, but I was very disappointed when I received a tiny 2 inch tall book instead of the standard one."
5,Amazing,"These people who write bad reviews must be paid. This book is simply a tool to use to change the way you think about money. The poor get poorer and the rich get richer why is that? This book explains why. Its all a state of mind. Poor people play they game not to lose. Rich people play the game to win. Which group you wanna be in? If you are an open-minded person, this mihgt be the best book purchase you ever make."
4,Still Relevant and Useful,"This book is timeless in that its principles and ideas can be applied universally. However, there is something that I find troubling about some of his teachings. On one hand he states that he does not advocate debt, but on the other hand, he seems to advocate borrowing money to take advantage of financial opportunities. All of his examples in this book that involve real estate seem to include an implied message of taking on debt. Perhaps I missed something, but that is how I read the examples. I do believe that the overall message is worth reading and it is important to increase your financial IQ. This is a quick read; thus, I recommend it."
3,"Good, but not many details","I found this but in a box while moving about 4 four years ago. Anyway I liked the but Robert makes very good points about knowing the deference between assets and liabilities, but that's about all you get."
2,Poorly written,"I had to read this book for a personal finance class. Most of the book is written as a dialog between the author and the rich dad. Reading this got old fast and I kept thinking to myself.. ""get to the point already!"" The impression I got from the author is that he is arrogant as he seems to talk himself and ""rich dad"" up a lot. There are six lessons that are presented and I didn't feel that they were valuble or really practical to the everyday person - maybe if you are a real estate tycoon they would have value. Thankfully this book was cheap so I didn't waste too much money on it."
2,"Who took my money, Robert K. did!!","This is a an interesting read but do not pay a penny for it. This falls under the category of info-tainment, but does have valuable information if taken lightly. I would hate to think of all the people that failed trying his knuckle head antics. The failure rate I am sure is high, but who's real problem is that anyway!!If indeed any of his quaint stories are factual, he is not a normal person, and probably exagerates his business success greatly prior to these books. I would probably be right making even stronger statements.It does not take a genious to make great real estate investments in a booming aloha land. Peopel line up in lotteries to bu 400K+ 1200 sq ft houses with out even knowing what lot they might get.If you are brave enough to strike out on your own this book plays to the emotional aspects."
3,Read John T. Reed's Analysis,"John T. Reed, author on real estate investing, has a web page devoted to the book. Like TV, I believe everyone should get balanced programming. Before buying and believing this book, please read opposing views."
2,"Good in some areas, weak in others","Snake oil, anyone?Thinks I agreed with:1. Stay away from credit card debt.2. Information is power.3. Become financially literate. Better to read business magazines, etc. than work on your golf swing.4. Buy investments that provide cash flow.5. Manage risk, don't avoid it.Things I disagreed with:1. Terminology. I disagreed with his definition of an asset. I agree that a house is not an investment, but it is an asset. He could have made the point without the confusing move of redefining an asset.2. Pay yourself first, even if it means that creditors and the government have to scream due to non-payment. This supposedly inspires your financial genius.3. Join a multi-level marketing organization to learn about sales.If you like Amway, you'll love this book. See also:[website]"
4,My $0.02,"This is a useful book to change the way we think. In terms of the how-to's, well, it's not a terribly easy subject to give concrete how-to's for. That ought to be a disclaimer in the book. However, it's a very valid way of thinking that might seem ""unfair"", but actually has a great deal of truth to it."
4,Broad strokes,"I liked the book, thought the stories were inspiration. I liked the general philosophy of wealth building this conveys as it is different. I do wish that this book would have gone into more specific detail on ""how to"" do things. I like some of this other books better than this one."
1,RIP OFF! THE BOOK IS ONLY 3 INCHES WIDE!!!!!!!!!,"This is NOT the real ""Rich Dad - Poor Dad"" book. Just look at the photos I posted of it and you'll see the real size. It's only 2 3/4"" by 3 1/4"" in size! It does NOT contain all the text that the original book does. It's a rip off!"
1,Worst financial advise book ever.,"Why is this the worst book ever?Because Robert promotes multi-level marketing (ie: [Sc]Amway)Robert has made no money on multi-level marketing.99% of people do not make money on multi-level marketing.Robert made his money selling fluffy, motivational books that brainwash people into having false dreams that multi-level marketing will bring fortune, fame and women.If you actually want to make money: read a book about how to write fluffy motivational books, then read a book on how to market your fluffy book to millions of Scamway drones. Finally, write a fluffy motivation book. Oh yeah, brainwash people into thinking they need to play $300 board games as they read the book too."
2,"Good for motivation, BAD for instruction","This book really opened my eyes to the fact that you can't be a wage slave all your life, so thanks for that. BUT, and this is a big but, Kiosaki is at heart a huckster. Research it online and you find ""Rich Dad"" doesn't exist. Kiosaki made him up. Once you realize this you realize that there's no lessons from a genius entrepreneur/investor but rather the whimsical musings of one man who made his fortune giving speeches and taking people's money in seminars. In interview after interview, he refuses to cite a single real-estate deal or concrete comapny he invested in - it's all nebulous and contradictory, just like his life story. So go ahead, buy a used copy for a buck or two, be inspired, but don't be sucked in. And whatever you do, don't pay for his ""Rich Dad Coaching"" scam through his website. I would, however, recommend getting the Cashflow 101 game, but NOT 202."
2,General and mean.,"The advice in the book seemed very general; save money, create assests, avoid overspending, etc. There were few specific lines of advice, but perhaps that wasn't the intent of the book. I kept waiting for the author to start explaining real ways to start investing, etc. He gave no starting points for someone actually looking to change their financial path. Either need to be rich already or be really young.The author also portrays his education-career ""poor dad"" in a very weak light. Mainly because he's a school teacher and seems family and people centered. Of course, I'd like to be a millionaire, but not at the cost of kindness, my family, and the use of intimidation. The ""rich dad"" seemed very jerkish.On the other hand, the book is quite inspirational and does a good job of getting the blood moving. It creates a good picture for someone to realize what financial traps they often set for themselves and what their potential could be."
2,Ill written but some good pointers,This book is terribly written and the author admits it. But for someone who is completely ignorant about money its a decent place to start.
4,Some fundamental rules about investments...,"To address some of the questions the reader might have:* It is written in an easy to read language.* The presented materials will take only an afternoon hours to read* It contains some fundamental rules about investing money.* It contains enough story elements to be interesting.This book can be considered fundamental reading material of every investor as the basic principles apply to other forms of investment as well. Real estate investments are a good goal to have, but for most of us it is not that easy to finance a home.The author has many good ideas but often seems to be vague in delivering strategies that give concrete advice. If you need more ideas this book is recommeded highly!"
5,Excellent book,"Ignore the negative reviews; it's a top seller for a reason! Some people just have issues, and are blocked by their own negativity. In a nutshell this book explains the different attitudes (Mental traits - The outlook of the way a person views situations!) This is ultimately the deciding factor between rich and poor people. I'm also an author of the book Woman Vs Womaniser ""This is the Book Men Do Not want Women to Read' [...] This is a self help book for women, but also shows my life journey which facilitates this. Here you see a very clear comparison of how different attitudes shape the way a persons life turns out. Rich dad poor Dad is not good it's brilliant!"
1,Moral: Rich Dad's Find a Way to Make You Buy Their Dumb Book,"This book was really annoying to read. He lectures the reader by thinking back to how he saw the world as a 7th grader and by retelling stories his ""other dad"" (his 7 yr old friend's dad) told him about money. The lessons are oversimplified and the stories are awful combination of overly exaggerated while still excruciatingly boring. I would hate to have to sit through a lecture or a meal with this guy. From reading the book, I get the impression that it would be like watching a stupid old man lecture an little kid about how his education is useless and how smart people learn financial awareness and get rich, while all the while the kid knows the old man just got rich on a stroke of luck and then rode it out the rest of his life. Awful. Awful."
4,Interesting point of view - but let's not underrate education,"Much of the information in the book is interesting, and I believe valuable for adults who are able to understand that alternatives exist to the traditional career path. A college education, however, is still a solid foundation not to be missed when planning one's career. I would want to be sure that young, impressionable minds were not detracted from this fact, when exploring all options available.-- RuthAnn"
2,rich dad....and poor idiot that bought the book! ha!,"This book makes some good points about money. But,the book seems more reared toward children age 8-17 that any adult. Yet, im sure many adults could learn from this book. overall this book was a little boring; and seems very fabricated at times. I probably could have written a better book about money over a bathroom break. The book seems to stress that education is not very important, entrepreneurs are rich, and everyone is poor and useless. I disagree! Being a budding entrepreneur myself i see the benefit of a formal education on a daily basis. The networking, social skills, and basics in all aspects of business(which every entrepreneur should know...accounting finance etc.) are gained from formal education. Sure, common sense is not. On that note i must agree with the author. But to condemn education so, i find it hard to digest."
2,Use your library card,"Frankly, this is a very poorly written book. I suppose the lessons about money were instructive -- to a degree. I think they were reasonably well illustrated, but talk about beating a dead horse.Granted the purpose of this book is not to shake up the literature scene, but to talk about peoples' attitudes about money and how irrational they can be. To the degree it does that, the book is worth reading.The thing is, the package ain't pretty. Having to read through the ""narrative"" is quite painful, if not completely uninteresting."
5,New to investing,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is appropriate for someone, like myself, who is new to investing. Also, it encourages me to teach my child to invest when he is older. It is very repetitious, but that is necessaary when teaching someone totally new to investing. Since my parents did not teach anything about investing or starting my own business, this book has been very motivational and ecouraging to me. I cannot even discuss my investments in front of my mother because she thinks that I am going to lose my hard earned money. But as the author repeats over and over again, I need to make money from my assets rather than rely on earned income exclusively. It is just the beginning to a lifetime of investing for me."
1,Warning: Do NOT Buy or Read This Book!,"It is unfortunate that I could not select 0 stars. I am an attorney, a licensed stockbroker, a licensed investment adviser, and I've worked in the investment industry for the better part of a decade. I constantly read books, articles, studies and trade journals, many related to personal finance and investing. I can say without hesitation that this is the worst advice on personal finance and investing I have ever come across. Some of it is wrong, some makes no sense, some of it is illegal. You should also know that it is mostly fiction. Kiyosaki admitted he made up the character of the Rich Dad and likely exagerrated or fabricated his own success story. Don't take my word for it; read John Reed's thorough research on Kiyosaki's claims at www.johntreed.com. Finally, is is disturbing that this book remains on the NYT best-selling ""Paperback Advice"" rather than ""Paperback Fiction"" list."
2,Wild ideas and ambitions.,This book has some radical new ideas that may lift a person's motivation but overall I didn't learn anything that is practical and most important financially sound. Taking risk is emphasized and investing in real estate is his main source of income but I think the numbers and stories are exagerated to increase its efficacy. I really didn't enjoy the book and besides there were some bad rumours about this author's honesty circulating the web.
4,"Inspiring book, but keep in mind, there are no easy answers!","Rich Dad, Poor Dad raises several important points about how (and why) individuals need to step back and take a fresh look at their perceptions on money, security, taxes and risk.HOWEVER, if you are looking for a quick fix, formula or easy answer to making money. This is not the book (nor should it be - if someone finds this magic, mythic book, please send me a copy!)Instead the book focuses on changing the traditional mindset when it comes to income (40+ hour work week for someone else no longer equates to financial security) and assets (is a pleasure boat, or a new car really an asset?)The book is plainly written so as to appeal to virtually any reading level and serves as more of an inspiration to make money rather than an explanation of how to make money."
4,GREAT INSPIRATION!!,"This book is a must read for MBA students. I am finishing a MBA program now and this book really puts things into perspective. The only reason I am not giving it four stars is due to the quality of the writing. However, the simple points are like gold nuggets!"
3,i'ts very nice in the way it brings people's attention.,"well, the book was just perfect. and a new idea that no one ever thought about it."
2,Childish Advice - Big Self Focus,"As with other and better written negative reviews, I thought the advice was childish and obvious. The only reason I did not give it 1 star was that sometimes the simple solution (ie. buy assets and not liabilities) is lost in the forest and is worth pointing out. Do I need to read how his real father was such a financial idiot and how he copied the behavior of his friends dad so that he could write books stroking himself and justifying his souless existance? Probably not. There are far better financial books out there."
2,"Some good info, but condescending!","Although there were some good things in the book (enouh to fill a page or two...) the overall attitude departed by the author was one of contempt for the middle class. What a jerk! He continually blasts the middle class for the way they live. What he fails to realize is that they live the way they do because they really aren't trying to be rich, just comfortable. It was extremely hard to get past his attitude and absorb the information he gives. But to summarize the bulk of the worthwhile info he does give:1) An asses is soemthing that yields revenue. Your home costs money and is not truly an asset.2) Earn the money to buy a desire, don't just go out and borrow money to buy it. If you don't have cash then don't buy it.3) Don't waste your money buying this book. Just get it from the library or bank."
2,Uncomfortable advice,"I will keep this short. I felt uncomfortable with the advice Robert was giving. He basically dissed his own father and loved and respected his pretend rich father. I can see gleening advice from someone who is business smart, but some of it just morally seemed wrong to me. He is basically saying your are not going to get anywhere by working for other people and we are saps for doing so. So, get your own business where other people work for you, don't pay them well, and rake in the cash. Sorry, couldn't do that if I wanted to, which I don't."
3,Who's Rich and Who's Poor ?,I have always found Robert a wonderful translator of other peoples technology. Having known him personally. I was surprised to have never heard of his rich dad before the release of his book. There is much to be gleaned from this book. The meta-message being who is truly rich or who is poor. Surely richness cannot be reduced to the number of properties you accumulate. I am a little disturbed by Robert's indication that he was born into the wrong family. The qualities that I like in this man have come undoubtedly from his poor Dad
3,How Can I Get Rich Through a Book?,"By writing them. I have read three of the Author's financial self help books and really have not been impressed by any of them. Yes, he talks a lot about the ways he has made money and even gives some decent examples of how other people might make money, but I doubt that he has found any sure fire method to become rich. I would take his work much more seriously if he published his books with copies of his tax returns and investment returns as proof of his methods. I would venture a guess that his largest source of income/wealth may be from his best-selling books."
3,Well-presented trivialities are an actual asset,"Having just been this book a bestseller, when I happened to read it I was very curious about the subject. But I have been quite disappointed by its content. Nothing more than a general autobiography, with some use of elementary economics terms (which can be a bit useful to non-english readers), the general level of the book is comparable to what you can find in many web sites. Not a hint can be found about the real problems and difficulties you meet setting up an activity of your own, and the text deals meanly with what people knows yet. However, I have assigned three stars because it is an easily readable item, and its general meaning, whatever trivial, is undoubtedly true. In a chapter, the author affirms to be a ""best-seller"", and not a ""best-writer"". I do agree with that statement."
3,What if nobody worked for their money?,"Vulture says to Lion, ""You're stupid to work so hard for your food. Instead of exhausting and injuring yourself chasing Buffalo, why don't you just cruise around picking up the pieces like me?"" Lion agrees. Soon all the predators are sitting around waiting for ""somebody"" to do the work. They all starve! Kiyosaki scorns people who work for their money but, thankfully, millions will continue producing ""meat"" that he can speculate with. However, the book is worth reading to remind us of some simple home truths such as, ""A fancy car is not an asset."""
1,Totally BS,I'd not give it a star at all if the system allows me to. Read on and you will find out: he became rich by telling people and making them believe HE can make them rich. What a cheat!(...)
4,Kiyosaki is a great motivator!,"While this book isn't the most efficient, it drags on a bit in the beginning and repeats itself at the end, it is still an effective motivator. Kiyosaki breaks things down simply, and offers a new perspective. This book has helped to get me excited and prepared me to begin my pursuit of financial freedom. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a way out of the ""rat race"" and is not afraid to think ""outside the box""."
3,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"If you read Rich kid Smart kid, you would believe me when i say that it is very similar to Rich Dad Poor Dad. Rich dad poor dad teaches individuals the requirements of becoming rich. It's a book that not only teaches indivduals how to become rich, it teaches individuals how to have money work for them.One lesson I liked from this book, was the teaching of discipline. Learning to control your emotion of fear and desire.I give this book a thumb's down on the redundancy.The author in my opinion, wrote this book up with a lot of redundant statements. But other than that, this book is a good tool for people that knows nothing of finance and investment."
4,"Good book, overly slammed","This book gets a lot of criticism that I think is undeserved. The author does not claim to be the Peter Drucker of wealth or have all the answers. Its a well done, somewhat anecdotal but useful book that can benefit most people. I run an investment company and have observed first hand the types of things that the book speaks about."
3,Good on inspiration lack on substance,"I took some time to re-read this book and understand the perpective he is offering. I always worked hard to generate alternative source of income and cut my taxes.when I bought this book, I was under the impression that this book would help me understand market economy and decide the in striking a balance between high income-high risk ventures and low risk - low income ones.Pros:If someone is buying this book, then he already is thinking about increasing his income. This book re-inforces the person's belief.Cons:This book does not talk about all the areas of making 'safe' money. Sometimes he has gone overboard in boasting his money making investments and kind of turn off for those who feel they dont have that kind of money or are not willing to risk so much.Overall its a good book."
2,Not much here,"The book does a good job of stressing that one should use their money to make money and not fall into the trap that most people do. However, it is way, way to wordy. It could be pared down substantially. It also does not give any specific strategies for creating wealth. It is very vague."
2,Very skeptical of this author,"A lot of rah-rah, not a lot of substance.I give it 2 stars only because I think it may have some motivational value. In terms of practical advice its value is minimal.You should also be aware that there is a lot of skepticism about this author and the claims he makes. Do some investigation and you'll likely be unsettled."
2,Be careful.,"The concepts in this book are very good and easy to understand. I've read two other books by Robert Kiyosaki that also provide a solid foundation for investing. Be careful about investing in his coaching services, they aim to make Robert richer at the buyer's expense."
1,its easy to make money selling books about common sense,"The book was interesting story about his life but thats all it seem to be about. There was only one thing I learned from this book. All you have to do is tell people how rich you supposedly are, and how you want to help them. Forget any original ideas, just repeat the same general ideas over and over again and people will buy it. The one thing I like about this author is how he can turn a couple well known ideas that would take a paragraph or two to explain, and turn it into 200 pages is amazing. So I probably will never get rich off of his general and vague financial advice, but I now know how to become a best selling author."
3,Pretty good read...,"It's a good read. The author clearly has a huge ego. I guess when you've figured out how to be rich, you get to have a big ego right?"
3,Good Begining,"This book brought together my thoughts about money that I have been thinking about over the past few years. I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks there is ""another way"" to supporting yourself in life. Like several of the other commenters, consider this book a good starting point. I am now motivated to read about setting up corporations and looking into real estate and stocks, one step at a time."
4,Worth the Time and $$,"If you are serious about taking control of your finances and retiring young, this book is a must have in your arsenal. It reads very easy and keeps your interest. I am not an avid reader, but I read this entire book in 2 days! I would also recommend ""Retire Young, Retire Rich"" (also by R.T. Kiyosaki)and ""Real Estate Riches"" (by one of his advisors Dolf de Roos)!"
3,"Interesting, helpful but odd in tone!","Great tips, but is he really suggesting that the causes of poverty are all in your head? In order to narrow the gap between the rich and poor, more than a pop psychological cure is needed. Most countries have laws and policies!"
1,I wish I had money,"I read the book and invested in Content Management Stock. Now I am poor, my wife left me and my car got stolen. But at least I have time to watch my superman movies along with my friend, the Invisible Man."
2,Alison G,I thought that this was a very interesting book but because it was not the normal type of book i read it was somewhat slow and not that entertaining for me. Besides that the information givin in this book was entresting as well as useful in everyones own life which i though were very intersting.
1,"The ""System"" that Made Mr. Kiyosaki Rich","If you carefully read ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" you will find the system that made the author a rich man.The system is NOT wise investments or low liabilities and high assests, nor is it business acumen or investing wisdom.No, his system was the writing of a book (this one) that is repetitious, low on substance and factual content, but which promises the reader that they too can be as successful as the author.The trouble is Mr. K presents NO proof whatsoever of his own success. He toots his own horn a lot. But there's not much behind the noise.There have been a number of exposes written about Kiyosaki. A little research and you'll find them easily. If you're interested in knowing what this author is really about, do a little homework, then, if you're still interested, buy the book.Reviewer: L. Painchaud"
4,Good start for most anyone,"In college I studied biology and psychology. I have no background in business and/or investing. I have developed an incurable interest in learning about this facet of life though. I found this book very enjoyable. Although what the author has to offer the reader is not rocket science...deep down I think we all know everything that he has to say BUT...the book is a fabulous summary. It provides easy and entertaining reading. It serves well as a ""pep rally"" to get yourself in line for a beginning in investments. Although I am sure I will never be the multimillionaire that the author is, it is refreshing to be reminded that we all have the potential and being ready for an opportunity is what makes the difference. Live within your means and invest a little bit at a time."
1,A fairy tale,"I agree with the reader from Iowa - September 23, 1999. Not only that, I watched my father, a property investor and developer, for over two decades and I have been a property attorney for over two decades. I can tell you that these sweet property deals do NOT fall into your lap (just two weeks of looking! huh) as implied by the book. You need to be looking for them all day every day like a bloodhound and you need to cultivate the bank officials and realtors, etc and BRIBE them for every such property that they might put your way. Not only that, dozens (if not hundreds) of others in property are competing with you to bribe these same officials."
2,Money Maker,I see this book as nothing more than a good money maker for the author. He appeals to peoples emotions and is very repeatitive about the same principles. This book will give you more entertainment than practical investing knowledge. A book that is based on sound fundementals would be more helpful.
4,Remember the Alamo!,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad is an excellent book, full of courage and audacity. If you take nothing more from this book than a positive, winning attitude then it is well worth the price. Too bad he doesn't give us a real system we can all use to get rich.I would recommend another book which does offer us a system for ""Getting everything we want in life."" It is a book by Thomas Pauley and Penelope Pauley entitled ""I'm Rich Beyond My Wildest Dreams. I am. I am. I am."""
3,A single chapter would suffice,"Boy... this guy sure stretched his material out pretty far. I mean, on numerous occasions I had to check to make sure that I was actually making progress because I was reading the exact same words I read on the previous page. The idea of avoiding high liability costs is an important one, but you can't help but think that 20-30 pages would have been more than enough."
3,Not worth the hype...inspirational at best,"This books is not nearly as helpful as one may hope. We come away learning that the author is rich and successful and knows how to make money. While he claims not to be tooting his own horn, her certainly does a lot of it. No, this book does not tell you how to become rich. What it does do is convey the mindset of someone who wants to become rich. Despite being horribly written, it is an interesting read. Note that Kiyosaki knows how to make money, so he knows how to market and sell books. In other words, by buying this book you are making him rich. That being said, it is marginally interesting.Education is never a bad thing."
3,rich dad versus poor dad,"This book was very informative and moved at a fast pace. I enjoyed it and found the way ""rich dad"" taught interesting. I might not agree with some of the ideas presented in this book, but it did open my eyes to the ""rat race"" that most everyone is stuck in. Overall it was a good book and i recommend it to people who want a short and fast read."
2,Something doesn't ring true,It's hard to put a finger on what I didn't like about this book. It just seemed very thin on specific examples and kind of hid behind the annonimity of the Rich Dad and the Poor Dad. It just didn't seem like a breakthrough piece of work to me.
1,Don't waste your time or your money,"I found this book not about wealth creation or getting rich, but a self-help stylized memoir of learning about money. It is woefully short on practical ideas and actions, and provides little outside of broad generalizations and rantings.In my view, ""Get a Financial Life"" combined with ""The Millionaire Next Door"" were far more educational with ideas and strategies that were readily applicable."
5,GREAT Information!,"I bought the tape series, and I am so glad that I did. I wish I could have been raised with this insight. I am applying the principals NOW to my finances. Worth the listen many times over!"
3,Some Good Info - but his Rich Dad was a jerk!,"This is a fun book to read. There is a lot of practical information and while most of it is common sense, it is presented in real life situations where it really jumps out at you. However, the way the Rich Dad carried on about wage earners (his own employees) being stupid was just abnoxious after a while. The idea that someone could actually enjoy their job is treated as unthinkable. The reality that someone who knows how to live within their means and who knows how to use the money they saved, could actually work a regular job that they enjoy and retire early and wealthy - not within this guy's paradym. Well I for one did and would not want to do it any other way. If the Poor Dad had any financial sense, he could have too while still being the teacher that he wanted to be. We don't all want to be rich jerks that look down on everyone else."
5,It can change your life too!,"Soon after reading this book in early 1999, My wife and I sold our so called dream home and moved into a smaller home with a much smaller mortgage. We now apply Robert's philosophies of assests and liabilities to our financial decisions. As a result we are much happier and have a much, much heftier net worth compared to this time last year. We are most certainly builing a financial base and education to take us to the next level. If you want financial well being or beyond, then this book gives you the critical information that is necessary to make it possible. Good Luck!"
2,"Encouraging, but condescending","Pros: It encouraged me to do something about my finances and to take risks. It gave me some starting pointers on how to make money work for me.Cons: The authors are so condescending to their audience. They also make ridiculous claims like the times they say people are poor because they have bad spending habits - you know, instead of being born into the wrong country/city/neighborhood/race. They advocate potentially illegal behavior."
1,"Reading this book cost me $400,000","i take responsibility for yhe money i lost in real estate investimg in the last few years an this book wasn't the only guide that set me down that path. Nonetheless, i think the idea that leverage and investimg with other peoples money is the path to wealth has, since 2008, taken a crippling blow personally, nationally and globally."
4,Rich Dad Poor Dad,Excellent book for anyone wanting to be financially secure. Takes a lot of time and determination but likely to work in long run
5,Nice,This is just a great read if you really want to make sure that your life is in order. I use this as a guideline ony because life is not perfect.
2,Starts ok...then gets bad,"I found the first half of this book ok, but the book gets worse and worse as you read it. Nothing in the book is concrete its all rather vague, I think there is a good reason for that. A lot of the things mentioned sound like tax evasion, ""Pay yourself first"" he says. He also pretends that corporations are these clever things that allow you to avoid taxes and fails to mention that for many people involved in business it can actually cost them more to incorporate. All the half-truths and vagueness make the book fairly worthless.If this guy is good at anything its marketing and selling books, not investment or business."
2,More philosophy than manual,"I found this book to be a nice pep talk, but it didn't have much concrete information in it. I would recommend the book to people who are looking to convert from consumer to investor, but this book will be mundane for anyone who has taken the first step towards being an investor.Because the book is an easy read (thank God, since it is verbose), I gave it 2 stars. I would have rated it higher, but the shameless advertising for the authors' other products (and encouragement to purchase such products) was a turn off."
4,My Poor Dad,"This was a really interesting book. I only started reading it for my economics class, but now i'm really glad I did it. Having a dad that isn't focused on finances and business I think this book really helped me to know that anyone can make money and be succesful. I thik its an easy book to read. It's a book that you can understand."
3,Good Info but less credible because some facts are wrong,"Robert Kiyosaki's premise that people should build tangible assets and spend less and more wisely is very good, but some of his stated facts are wrong and makes the book lose some credibility. For one, he mentions that the corporate tax rate is less than the personal tax rate, but that fact applies only to incomes less than $; most folks/corporation earn considerably more than $... Also Robert says airline pilots have over 100,000 hours of flight experience; that number for senior captains is closer to 25,000 hours. A few other facts were very iffy from my experience in financial dealings which taints all of his statistics in my view. If the book can convince some of the younger generation to start building real assets and spend wisely, then the book will be of great service."
1,Too bad Amazon does not have 0 * category...,"I have read about first 90 pages of this book and frankly speaking, it seems to be offending any educated person's intelligence. I can't understand why the book is so popular...The book's main premise seems to be that one should invest only in income generating activities (author calls these ""assets"") and avoid any expense related activities (""liabilities""). Lot of what was said in the first 90 pages was commonsense and so repetitive that I started skipping sentences, paragraphs and then even pages without missing out much. I shouldn't have bought this one...I would not add this book to my ""asset"" column. For those who have already bought this book, I recommend that they follow the author's advice about ""assets"" and ""liabilities"" - and sell this book :-) I did."
3,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad, investment savvy","Having promised myself years ago to 'DO' something about investments for getting wealthier and for retirement like many did nothing, always too busy. Well, this book is a wake-up call to all those investment savvy wannabees, like myself who keep putting it off. If you can't set an example to your children then how are they to learn? Start small and have fun is good advice. Robert does however 'go on a bit' with repetition on some of his principals, but I wonder if that's not deliberate, to get us all to LISTEN to him. Wonderful light reading, inspiring and yes this time I am going to do it. For the children's sake atleast."
4,Econ book review,"Overall, a very good and insightful book. Very easy and quick to read. Very informative about many economic principles. Highly recommended if you want to know more about how to become monetarily successful.JJS"
2,Money Saving Tip,"Read ""Rich Dad's Guide to Investing"" and forget about Kiyosaki's other books - the third book in the series captures all the ideas this man has. If you must, browse through the other books in the bookstore - you will realize that the information is repeated, and that you can save a lot of money by not buying his other books."
3,"Rich Dad, Rich Writer","If you haven't learned the truths of this book at home, you better read it here. This is a fast read of common sense truth, that will challenge you to examine your motives for work. Kiyosaki has a passion for helping people realize they are ultimately responsible for their own wealth (or lack thereof). His big secret is pretty obvious: spend less than you make. I was glad to have picked up this book, and you will be, too."
4,How to make money 101,"This should be a required course in every college. The phrase ""stop working for your money and start making money work for you"" gets thrown around a lot, but this book shows how to do it, and more importantly, how to get the right perspective about money in the first place. A downside to this book is his writing style is not always polished, and I noticed spelling errors, but the content is rich and valuable. Please read this book and start finding those ""income producing assets!!!"""
1,Give Me a Break!,"I am sorry, but I don't believe anyone could honestly write a positive review about this ""book"". There is simply nothing in it! This book is nothing but a collection of useless stories and junk advice. I was looking for some concrete suggestions and ideas on how to improve my finances. What I got instead were some stories my 3 year old would not believe. This was not worth the $3 I spent to buy it at the used book store. Kyosaki must be a marketing genius, because that is what it would take to get so many people to buy this book. What a con!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"If you need this book to teach you anything about money you are in a very sad shape. Yes, it is good to save money. Yes, it is good to invest it. Yes, it is good not to waste your money on frivolous things which depreciate quickly (ironically the author doesnt seem to take this advice...). Thats the entire book. If there were a cynic in the room, they might suggest that this book is a sort of pyramid scheme. Kiyosaki writes a book about becoming rich, the profits of which do indeed make him richer; perhaps some people succeed doing his non-existent system, perhaps some go broke, but it doesnt matter to him because he already has your money. Moreover, this book implies that insider trading, and the exploitation of friends are things to aspire to and that government workers (including police officers and firemen) are ""lazy thieves"". Another man trying to part a fool from his money...don't take the bair."
1,made me think but that's about it...,"i was excited to read this initially...after all, it WAS a best seller...it had to be saying something valuable, right?a third of the way in the book, i already had a feeling of distrust and everything just seemed very generic and sketchy...just do a google search on: john reed kiyosaki ...and learn a bit more about the author...i didn't bother to finish the rest of it...there are a lot of better ways of securing your financial future. and a lot of that is plain common sense. and educating yourself on real estate. not via some quick-schemed ""Amway""-type course..."
4,"Thought provoking, a new point of view","I liked this book, it's an easy read and offers a very different perspective from anything I've ever been told before. I didn't take the advice that he gives, because it is pretty radical and I'm not quite bold enough. But I take what he said into consideration and I like any book that gives me a new perspective."
4,Important reading,"It is a very useful reading, not only for materially-oriented people, but also for those who think money should not be the center of their lifes."
4,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","If only all high school students could read this book. It would change, entirely, our thinking on preparing young people for life."
5,Teach Kids early,"These ideas and systems should be taught to all kids starting at an early age, but we are never to old to learn something new."
5,Great investment!,I had borrowed this book from a friend because it was recommended as a great read. I started reading it and I just had to get my own copy. I recommend this read to all parents.
4,Inspiring Book!,"I really feel this book has great insight to acquiring money and keeping it. I found the book to be inspiring. It was nice to see someone say that schools should be teaching kids this stuff. I think if they did, we would have a very different world. I think the best bit of information I learned from Rich Dad Poor Dad was: ""Dont work for money, let money work for you."".A. Byron (Los Angeles, CA USA)"
4,"Only ""Rich Dad"" Book Worth Buying","Worth the money for the authors approach about assets and liabilities. His personal story is not very interesting but I like the way he focuses on different types of income. Do not expect a lot of detailed information since most of his ""examples"" are BS. His wife needed a new car so she just went out and found a property that would give her $500/month cash flow with no money down. Yeah right. All said and done though this book will motivate you and help keep your head in the right mind-frame.Do not bother buying ANY of the other Rich Dad, Poor Dad books, they are only a re-hash of the information in this one."
4,Teach your children the basics from this book....,"This book teaches the basics of business & personall accounting, a must read if your goal is personal, financial or business success..Follow through on your education with Roberts other books & best selling game, ""Cashflow""... You won't regret your investment !"
4,Small but Great Reading,"Do not expect a big book. This book will fit in your shirt pocket, but has a lot to say. It makes you think about education. I am not saying that you do not need eduction, but to succeed you have to have a inner drive. You have to have a reason to want to succeed."
2,Good only as a pep talk,"This book is good as a motivational reference, but I would hazard to guess that it wasn't written to actually make other people rich. Mr Kiyosaki provides questionable facts (a little online research shows this) to back up his statements, but no concrete way of actually duplicating his success. Some of the other books in his series are much better in this respect, but are still often filled with duplicate information and other extraneous details.Overall, skip this unless you need a pep talk."
2,Very repetitive,"I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. While it wasn't horrible, I couldn't get past how many times the author restated the same thing. He gets stuck on a topic and won't move on. I got it the third time you said it. I also thought his financial examples left out many important items. He talks about making money out of no money. How can that be? His example states that he bought a $75,000 house for $20,000. In the end, he sold the house for $60,000 so he said he made $40,000 out of nothing. In the end, he might have made out but for some period of time he was out 20 grand. Am I missing something here?I wish I had checked this book out from the library. There's some fundamental principles we can all follow but it's not worth a purchase."
5,Build a Financial Foundation Deep and Wide,"Robert Kiyosaki is not a brilliant writer, but he is a brilliant educator. His message is clearly conveyed in simple language - The majority of us never learn about how to make money work for us, but instead we learn how to work for money - which keeps us in a type of slavery we can't easily understand.There are rules about money that you must learn in order to become independently wealthy, and you don't learn them in school. ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" will help you begin to build the wide and deep foundation that you will need in order to build your wealth.Be ready to make a committment to change. It is not easy, and just knowing the answers is not enough. Get ""The Child Whisperer"" by Matt Pasquinilli to help get started taking action. Although the title sounds like it is only for parents or teachers, It seems to be written to help you understand why you act the way you do and how to change it."
1,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","Like many supposed finance and business books of this ilk,the prose takes 10 times as much space as it needs. Given its size, this means that the book could be about 10 pages andstill be as effective.The book is high on inspiration and low on skill building.Any of the ""For Dummies"" or ""Complete Idiot"" guides on financewould be superior. For those looking to found their own businessto achieve independence, ""Business Plans that Win $"" is muchmore bang for the buck"
1,"Lack substance, long-winded","If you are looking for specifics on how to make money, you will be disappointed. This book tells you what to do, rather than how to go about doing it. Few of us need to be told that in order to become rich, we have to cultivate our `Financial IQ' and invest wisely, etc, etc. This amounts to plain rhetoric, although the author is without doubt a brilliant marketeer who expertly packaged his otherwise commonsensical ideas and made use of a catchy title. I find it rather irritating to see the same few ideas being repeated so many times throughout the book, as if the readers are so dumb that they need reinforcements. I am amazed that such a hollow topic can take up close to 200 pages! Don't waste your time on this book. To me, this whole thing is just another fad."
1,Simplistic and lacking in real get rich methods,This book is very simplistic. It would be like getting a book on how to become a brain surgeon that tells you to go to college and major in pre-med then go to medical school and then specialize in surgery.It is not offensive but it is too lacking in real information to be helpful. There are no secrets methods to get rich in this book.I doubt that rich people are reading books on how to get rich.I think they are busy doing what it takes to get rich.
2,What's all the buzz about?,"I like to read good financial books and this book kept getting a lot of buzz, so I finally got around to reading it? I just don't understand why so many people rave about this book.Instead of giving you tools, this book is about changing your thinking process.In essence, I'll sum up the lessons here:1. He redefines assets and liabilities. Assets put money in your pocket, liabilities cost you money. Thus your home is probably a liability while you live in it. Of course, you have to live somewhere, right?2. Educate yourself about financial matters. No actual education given in this book.3. Try and be of a mindset to spot and take advantage of opportunities, where ever they may be.4. Instead of just assuming you can or cannot do something, ask yourself why you can or can't. Put some thought and analysis into it, instead of letting your emotions rule your decisions.Sorry, I expect a lot more from a book that gets this many rave reviews."
5,great book to get you started on investing and inspired,"i was inspired by this book to learn how to make ""my money work for me"" rather than ""working for my money."" this book will give you a feel for basic concepts of assets versus liabilities. however, it won't teach you exactly how to invest your money or what different options are really about. the point is to inspire you to read more and learn more so that when you do decide to start investing, it won't be as risky. lack of knowledge is risky, but gaining knowledge reduces your risk simply by understanding what's going on."
1,Buyer Beware!,"If you are seriously considering buying this book, take a few minutes to consider carefully why you are about to do so. If you are looking for financial advice, I suggest you look elsewhere. Not only did I find Kiyosaki's book vague and repetitive, but I also seriously questioned some of the advice he gives. At one point in the book (that is if he is telling the truth), Kiyosaki admits to insider trading. If you know anything about the stock market, you know that this is TOTALLY ILLEGAL! After seeing this, I decided to llok up some information about Kiyosaki online. The results were not good. ... Good luck in your financial future. I hope you can find a better book to guide you."
5,Good introductory book,A very good book for those trying to figure out why after many salary increases they have yet to show any assets for them. The mystery is solved in this book. The book does not provide the reader with a detailed map towards financial independence but it does point out why the majority fails to reach that pot of gold.
4,Persistent,"This book has amazingly good points but it is very repetitive. Not only that but if everyone that read this book actually did what it said to do and were successful then the whole world would eventually be shooken up. As sad as it is society thrives on having a class system (Rich, Middle & Poor). If everyone was all of a sudden getting rich then no one would want to do the dirty jobs and as well if the author brought up social security, Medicare and retirement plans then he should have gone into why people should not rely on the government. This is an amazing book to get people to start thinking but only very few will ever be able to follow it's advice and be successful."
4,Very Inspirational!!!,"I chose this book for a school project and I really enjoyed it! Robert Kiyosaki guides the reader through a series of lectures that were given to him as a child. As Kiyosaki learns about the power of money, we too learn and benefit from his advice. This book was very inspirational and I recommend it to annyone who is interested in making a little money.ps mr.J this is julia!!"
2,Don't bother,"The first couple chapters of this book have some good ideas, but after that, I'll save you some time and a little money. Here's what the rich teach their kids: Start saving early, preserve principal, don't get into debt, pay yourself first, invest aggressively. That's it. He's got some questionable advice, too. The author made a lot of his money by investing in penny stocks. What he doesn't tell you is that 85% of penny stocks fail. Tax lien certificates are another favorite of his. Other than that, there are no specifics in the book. If you want to learn what the wealthy know about money, read ""Millionaire Next Door"". If you want investing specifics, try the Motley Fool Books (""The Foolish Four"" is good). If you're burried in debt, Suze Orman has some good stuff (9 Steps To Financial Freedom). If you've read all those, go ahead and send this guy $. Or better yet, invest it in penny stocks!"
4,Great for concepts but not for content,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a new perspective on wealth and money. Kiyosaki has managed to repackage classic ideas about money (i.e. those presented in ""The Richest Man in Babylon"") in a way that will inspire modern day wealth-seekers.I would not, however, recommend this book to anyone looking for tactical information on how to build wealth. While this book is more than just ""Babylon"" with a new purple cover, don't bother to crack the spine if you want specifics or strategy on how Rich Dad made his millions."
2,Not exactly what I paid for,"I think that this book was a genuine effort and I found some value in the book. It's a good motivational book but it lacks substance. It made me reconsider my view point, which is important: I handle my personal finances better. However, the book is so theoretical (and repeticious) that it shouldn't be purchased as a guide to wealth because there is little to no concrete advise to begin the journey. It ignites a fire but very, very little more."
4,Pretty good at shifting paradigm,"First thing first. This is not a how-to book, it's a book on mindset. With that frame of reference, I think you will find this book very helpful. The repetitiveness of it does cause one to skip ahead, but I believe that the author is subscribing to the thought that if you hear something 5 or 6 times, it will sink in. It did for me."
4,"Simplistic, But Excellent Advice","When I started this book, it seemed very simplistic, although written in an engaging style. I thought what he had to say was interesting, but didn't feel it was going to tell me anything I didn't know. But the more I read, the better I thought the book was. By the time I finished it, it really did help me and motivate me to change my circumstances. He doesn't tell you what to DO in this book, although he does give plenty of examples of what he did for you to think about. What this book is trying to do is to change your METHOD OF THINKING. And it really succeeds, as far as I'm concerned. He reminds me a lot of some very successful people I know in real estate, the way he thinks and talks."
3,Check it out from your local library.,"This book is very popular but not practical guide to becoming financial stable/wealthy or an entrepreneur. Due to the popularity of this book, it is likely that the specific recommendations in the book have been attempted by one of the many people who has purchased the book and had the money to start his own business.The good idea mentioned in this book is ""Invest your expendable income wisely and don't squander it."" If you don't have expendable income to invest, this book is not going to put you on that road. You probably want some books on savings and more reasonable alternative forms of income. You could also learn a lot from The 9 Steps of Financial Freedom by Suze Orman. If you do have enough expendable income to invest, you might want to read any of the books by Peter Hupalo or The Entrepreneur's Guide to Finance & Business: Wealth Creation Techniques for Growing a Business."
1,A package of poor and dull thoughts.,"I am astounded to see that so many Americans bought this book. This book is a package of repetitive dullness. I am very busy, but could not resist myself to write this review, so that other fellow Americans are not cheated."
2,A readable first investment-book for teen's,"This book gets five stars for readability. The style is conversational so fits people who dislike lectures.Not a recipe book. rather this is meant as the first of a series of books by the same author. This means you should expect little in content and much teasing about what can be done. See the list of recommended readings.DO PICK UP the book to see its recommended reading if you are more of a scholar type.Must give credit where it's due. I found several tidbits that were useful, and many ideas that were in my head but the author articulated them and crystalised them for me.the review is intentionally low to attract you to read on."
5,Everyone should red this book!,"My personal opinion is that everyone that cares about money should read this book,from teenage to elderly.It is full of wise advices of how to manage your money and everyone will see a little about themselves in this GREAT book."
5,Great Book,"Loved the book, it snaps you out of the thinking that all you can do is work for someone else and gives you confidence to go out on your own. After reading all the books, I bought the board game, (cashflow 101)I wrote a review on the game which you can check out at ..."
1,"This book isn't reality, it's one man's opinion","The book is not based on reality. If it was based on reality it would be published by a university press and based on empirical studies. Instead this is one man's opinion intended to sell, not educate. Do yourself a favor and stop shopping / reading books from the self-help section. Check the author's credentials every time. If they are trying to sell you health advice, then they better have a PhD from an Ivy League University, be affiliated with a prestigious hospital, and have years of clinical medical experience. If they tell you, they are a best-selling author, it doesn't mean anything. Popularity has never been a test for accuracy / truth."
1,used car salesman,what a way to make money write investment books that tell u nothing and offer seminars to teach u...then high pressure bully tactics to make u sign up for big cost seminars that r all fluff...Y has the rich dad companies all changed there names so many times...how many law suits can they get out off...
3,Great first book ...,This is a great first book of a 3 part series .... I have also purchased and read the guide to Investing and in short the above book is far better and cheaper.My advice is buy this book but none of the others. To me it seems like the first book is written as a great ''taster' book to get you hooked on the concepts and theories that have worked for the author - if you want more of a 'taste' the next book is more expensive but in my view not a better book - For instance the guide to Investing is repetitive and badly written. The author could have written a book at a third of the size and made exactly the same points.
2,OUTSTANDING! EYE OPENING!,THIS BOOK IS GREAT AND I WOULD ADVICE EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BEING RICH TO READ IT.FULL OF INFORMATION TO LIVE YOUR LIFE BY.
4,Very Good Book,I would certainly recommend this book to other people. There was a decent amount of good information and it was written well.
2,"Smith Book Club- UOM- NHS-Hyattsville,Md","I like this book to a certain extent. This book was interesting because it gets many accurate points across. It is a fact that many parents do not teach their children the important facts about the priviledge having money, saving money, and maintaining it in order to become successful. Being rich does not last long if you do not know how to handle your money. However, the book started to sound ""unreal"" to me because it started to sound like a infomercial with a cover. This book made becoming rich and gaining control over my financial future to easy and too good to be true!!!"
1,THIS GUY IS A CON-MAN,"I can't read this stuff. The stories are long and seemingly pointless. I tried skipping through to find the pearls of wisdom, but I never found any. One story tells in endless dull detail how he worked for 10 cents an hour when he was a kid. Who cares? Just get to the point.I've seen this guy on TV, and he's a salesman. He tells you, over and over, how rich he is and how smart he is, but he never tells you anything you can use. I suspect he got rich by selling these books, which tell you how to get rich, supposedly. Looks like baloney to me.I think he is a con-man."
3,Good Starter Book,"I am totally new to investing and I found this book to be a good start and an excellent motivator. It is filled with many good ideas. However, I found a lot of repetition that seemed to me unnecessary. Books don't have to be thick in order to be good. The author could have stated the valuable messages in only a few chapters. Nonetheless, though it is repetetive, I found this book very useful."
3,"A few good points, but ...","I purchased this book after seeing it on the New York Times best seller list. While it offered a few good points to ponder, it was a frustrating read. It was redundant, and the author rarely went into enough depth to make this at all practical....An aside. I couldn't help but feel sorry for his real ""educated"" dad who was continually slammed in this book. The rich dad/poor dad metaphor got a little old by the end."
4,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a profound book that challenges conventional ideas. While some of the ideas are obvious, some are new to me and hard to grasp. With proper understanding this book has the power to change a persons life and the way they look at money. However, many of the techniques such as the stock market and real estate investing are over simplified and presented in a way that makes them seem a lot easier than they are.This book can be used as a tool to jump start a succussful financial future. I am glad I chose to read this book and am going to buy the sequel book, Rich Dad's Guide to Investing."
5,Smart Read,"Great book, People don't wanna be stuck in the rat race forever...this book teaches you how to think about money wisely, and instead of working for money, make money work for you. I know this book has changed my perception about money and it will help me throughout life. read this book..age does not matter, Robert T. Keyosaki makes it very simple."
4,"A good, newer idea","The idea I liked about this book is that it differentiates the traditional idea of the American dream, that you should go to school and get a good education and get a good job, from the alternative, which is that you should try to find other ways to make money, and then it gives some general guidelines on how to do just that. It doesn't give specifics, I guess because there are a million ways to make money in a free-market economy. If it had given specifics I would suspect that it is tied to a specific scheme that someone is making money selling.I've read another book in the series, ""Tax loopholes for the Rich"" which also is not an easy, take-you-by-the-hand"" plan. It demands that you follow a comprehensive, hands-on formula for developing a general, overall business plan for your activities.So I don't think this series of books is just about making money for the author(s), but also gives useful information."
4,Many people do not know ...,"Kiyosaki wanted to get rich when he was ten. His friend's father taught him and his friend the way of making money work for them. First he did not understand all of it but continued to work and learn. His book explains how the rich acquire their money and how to maintain one's wealth.Many people do not know that money can work for them and many are afraid of handling or loosing money. They do not know how to save it and do not believe that it is important to know about financial literacy. Therefore they believe that only lucky people get rich and do not try to think about their finances. I thought that it is important to see the difference of how the rich manage their money and how the poor manage theirs. It was interesting that it seems easier to teach children, than adults. Children are still learning and most adults do not consider another opinion or they rather believe warnings than go take risks."
1,the most overrated book in america,"This is the most over-rated book in America. Read it and show me ONE specific idea of how to make money.By the way, the rich dad is fictional."
3,Not a bad purchase,"I purchased this book for my 17 son. He is totally new to money matters. This book should serve him well for he has many years ahead of him to build his up his assets. Neverless, the wisdom in this book is nothing new and is pretty much common sense - reduce your expense so you can start investing in money producing investments. The author spends too time with his good dad - bad dad stories when I would rather read more concrete examples demonstrating his ""financial literacy"". Also I think he discounts education a little too much. Education is still the best vehicle for the middle class to increase their income so they can start asset investing. Try doing that on minimum wage."
1,What A Crock,"I can't believe how many people found this book to be filled with ""life-changing"" information. How many of you have quit your job and started living off of your riches? None of you, except Robert Kiyosaki. And his secret to success is selling this load of a book to millions of unsuspecting readers. Why does the secret to being rich always somehow involve shady and complicated real-estate sale? I know (or have met) 4 or 5 rich people in my life and they all had college educations. On top of that, they all worked their behinds off. The first step to choosing to be rich is not wasting 12 dollars on this nonsense."
1,Simply Bad!,"This is simply a bad book. It contains almost nothing but the author's tall tales, and very little concrete information or advice. What little advice is offered tends to be bad!There are far better financial advice books out there. Try ""Get a Financial Life"", by Beth Kobliner, for some sound (if unglamorous)advice, for example."
3,"Smart Author, Dumb Author","Have you ever had someone who told you what you wanted to hear, and you were glad that they did? That's the best way I can describe my experience with this book. Lucky for me that I read this as a motivational book that expanded my financial perspective. It is not a how-to guide, and I would probably lose my money if I tried to copy his examples.His advice on the rules of the game, how to view assets and liabilities, and the importance of financial literacy are necessary for the traditional ""work-hard and save"" crowd.However, a college education can be an advantage for anyone. Besides the book knowledge, you make invaluable contacts and set the foundation for getting a job that will provide investment capital. There are other nuggets of questionable advice.Learn what you can, but read between the lines. He is giving you a clinic on how to market, sell, and keep customers. Unfortunately, it is usually the talented ones that make it look easy."
5,Very insightful book,"I found this book enlightening and changed my perspective big time. I was taught all of my life that I should go to college, get good grades and land a salaried job then work my way up. However, I wasn't taught about the dangers of credit card debt and less emphasis on investing. This book isn't about finding best job or pay, but about what's keeping you from being rich. It's a great book and very easy to read. I understood the basic concepts and I wish I learned those facts when I was younger and prevented myself going into debt in the first place. And to invest. If I avoided both mistakes, I probably would be traveling all over the world by now because of the investments to keep me out of hot water and not have to worry about finding the BEST job out there or higher costs of living, and only do what I love to do. Enjoy life and worry less."
5,Success is a choice!,"I loved this book. Serious, yet funny, it gets straight to the point: your future success and financial standing lies in your hands. If you are serious about succeeding in the financial world - and your personal life tied to it, then this book is a must-have for you and your family.The principles in this book has had a major affect on my attitude to finances and the methods to generate money. Indirectly, it also made an investment in my own career as a motivational speaker and author.Rich Dad was one of those books that I couldn't put down, and better still, I couldn't wait to apply the principles. This book is well worth your time and money."
3,How to write a best seller,This is a very clever book that explains how to apply financial management to an individual's personal budget. You don't need to know anything about finances to fully understand this book. This is probably why it has become a best seller. Because it is able to transfer knowledge to the masses and persuade them.
5,Rich Dad Poor Dad,This book is so inspirational. I absolutly loved it. I would recommened this book to anyone with ideas of self-improvement. The format of this book is great for all types of readers. I am very anxious to read the next book.
1,awesome information/poor quality edition,"This is a really interesting, well written book which I purchased for my children after reading a friend's copy. Unfortunately the seller did not disclose that this was a poor quality copy with a font size that was miniscule. NOT the edition that I was expecting to recieve. I won't byu from them again."
5,"Great Read, better application","This book challenges the reader to get out of the box. While it presents two differing ideologies in regards to money and wealth, it makes a great argument for the unconventional approach/view towards becoming successful. The content seems more like an honest representation of the author's real life experience or interpretation of it. This should be necessary for first year students in finance as it flies in the face on convention yet makes practical sense."
5,Best financial book I have ever read!,"If you've ever read a financial book like ""The Millionare Next Door"", or, ""The Richest Man in Babylon"", and felt there was still something missing, this book will tie it all together for you. If you've got high-income friends who are still poor, recommend this to them."
5,I've been doing it wrong for too long ...,"This book shows me in diagrams, examples, and stories how I have created my financial situations. I have done what my parents have told me, go to school, get a degree, get a job and then retire. Boy, have they been off. After reading this book I only want to do what everybody else isn't! Learn for knowledge, be not afraid of money, and go out and create a successful side business. From now on my mentors are going to be only the people who have been successful in whatever I am undertaking. I choose not to listen to another cynic!This book is great! I plan to read it again and again to make sure I have not missed anything from a mentor."
1,Inmoral,"This book is inmoral, but it is not exactly wrong. You can make money by having property and leasing it to others. Instead of reading this motivational speech, however, you should take a copy of Marx's Das Kapital and read it. There you have, having other people work for you, producing surplus-value, will make you rich. Voila. It is called capitalism, you know."
4,Good educational read on economic fundamentals...,This book is a very strong and pratical read that will change your thinking towards economics and the power of a dollar. I was intrigued with Robert K.'s examples and conversational tone in the book. I would encourage this book to younger readers as well.
1,Dont waste your time,"Just like everyone else i was pleased with the amount of helpful info that the author was giving. At least that was my initial perception. Here's the real problem i have with the author: in his books he never mentions what companies or corporations he is/was involved. He keeps on preaching Real Estate, but if you do some research you find out that his true income comes from the books that he sells. The background check also states that the book is more fiction than anything else( so please dont give me the garbage of the TRUE STORY of rich dad and poor dad)."
1,"Short on detail, long on phony stories","This book could be retitled ""Buy this Book, Make Kiyosaki Rich"". This book is extremely short on details and designed to get you buy more of his products. Also it's full of catchphrases so you think you are actually learning something worthwhile. It's also interesting to me that no one has been able to find kiyosaki's ""rich dad"" anywhere. Does this guy even exist? Also what business did he sell to retire at age 47? The fact that he doesn't give any details on this makes everything he says pure anecdotal nonsense.If you buy illogical and poorly researched nutritional information books then this might be up your ally on personal finance."
1,substantive review,"This book is a good example of how a lot of money can be made by writing a gimmicky book with a catchy title.It contains more bad advice than good. Overall, its garbage.An unsophisticated investor could end up in a great deal of debt by following the advice in this book."
3,Rich Dad Poor Dad...,"I found the book to be alright, i think he is very repetitive about everything he says. I could of just read the first 60 pages and stopped. Maybe it was too basic or for some beginner but i was not that impressed with the ""best seller""."
5,Gets you thinking,Awesome book to get you thinking about your finances and it's truly inspiring. Maybe I should buy hundreds of copies and send to the President and each member in Congress to inspire them and get them thinking?
4,Learned a lot,"The author has presented the income-expenses-assets-liabilities personal finance structure, which is really accurate. There are many really good points made - about learning, work and the way people live.I find some of the examples a bit strange though. For example I don't agree that buying and selling real estate makes passive income, it requires studying the market constantly. If you buy real estate and rent it out - now that's passive income.Anyway, anyone can learn a lot from this book, no matter what they do for a living."
1,$20 in the trash,"This book is the all-time winner for the worst book - of any kind - I've ever read. Kiyosaki has provided nearly 200 pages of repetitive, contradictory, meaningless pandering pap. The best thing that can be said about this book is, congratulations to him for marketing an ages-old scam approach based on unprovable fables and dreamy wishful thinking. There are absolutely no specifics and several tactics he does provide are literally illegal.Want success? Just quit your job, get smarter people than you to work for you, make insulting and ridiculous offers for real estate, break the IRS and SEC laws and spend $3000 on a Kiyosaki seminar.If you want details before you buy or even touch this book, read the excellent expose at johntreed.com. I wish I had. I literally just threw a $20 bill into the trash - and Mr. Kiyosaki got half of it."
1,ITEM IS NOT AS DESCRIBED,This is a Great book but Amazon did not describe this book and being pocket sized! The pictures they have are from the regular version/size. The $4.95 version is small pocket book size and is vey small to read I ordered 10 of these thinking it would be regular size. Amazon please change your description
1,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money--That the Poor and the Middle Class Do Not! [ABRIDGED]","I thoroughly agree with George Helber's review. Who would have thought that Amazon's offering of a ""book"" would consist of a little ~ 2x3 inch item? Maybe the ""real"" book has value, but caveat emptor on this particular version - worthless. Well, my family derived worth from the look on my face when I opened the package; everyone had a good laugh."
4,This is a must read book!,I am really impressed with the writing in this book. Being a new comer in the world of investing and money management I feel this book is written for someone like me to understand and to put into motion. I was so capture by this book that I immediately went out and brought five other book from Robert kiyosaki. I really recommend anyone who care about a well balance financial future these series of books are a required reading.Enjoy!
5,Get ready to change your status quo,"RDPD demands of you. It grips you and challenges your status quo regarding studies, careers, all financial thinking. Most people will read it and say great book, excellent book, put it down and do nothing afterwards. If you're yearning for change and you want to become a millionaire, then this is one way to get you there. If you don't already have some insatiable desire to become a millionaire, this book will not give that desire to you - it has to be there, ready to explode from within using RDPD principles. If you are quite content with the corporate life and do not wish to become your own boss, you'll appreciate the book but from a merely `Good book' mindset. Why Buy: To become a millionaire. As a gift for an entrepreneurial minded friend. As a unisex gift you keep for the day you forgot to buy someone a gift for an occasion you should not have forgotten."
4,A brilliant basis to pave the way to your financial freedom,"Rich Dad Poor Dad explains the basics behind becoming financially free. Aquiring assets and reducing debts may seem like simple logic to many but for the majority of the worlds population living in debt it clearly is not.I personally can say that this book has paved the way to my financial freedom and motivated me to get out of the rat race and take the path less travelled (or the riskier path).I recommend this book to anyone who would like to start on their path to financial freedom and while they are definitely more comprehensive books out there, Rich Dad Poor Dad is the book I would give to my kids, wife and friends to get them thinking of what could be..."
5,very good,"Very good. Read it. Live it. Refer to it.This book will change your outlook on money and work. This is not a how to book, rather this is the what to do before you read a how to book. This explains how to expand the CONTEXT of your mind as well as the CONTENT in your mind. Very inspirational by making things that seem difficult to grasp appear to be a bit more attainable.Just read it."
5,Abbsolutely the best Chocolate Chicken BBQ franchise ever!,"Robert, I have to hand it to you, you really have made it to the BIG TIME. With the help of your ancient secret Choco Chic BBQ recipe, I have made millions. I will retire soon and spend my time writing anonymous reviews, of my own book, maybe we trade reviews, I like how you balance the nationality of the ""readers"""
2,rich dad poor dad,"Although the two fathers were different in many ways they also had something in common. They both believed in education. They both were influential, helping and loving of their son. They both gave Robert advice about education and knowledge but they both gave different advice on it. They both had different values of money one, didn't give it much care and the other thought of it as very important. While growing up Robert though about the both ways and combined the ways of the two father. I agree with the fact that you can't rely on schools to teach you everything about money and economy. But I also think, in most cases, having an education only until the eight grades will not make you very successful. Because if you don't have any ideas about life, you need some education in a higher level, more than high school, to be able to run a successful business."
3,"An easy, interesting read for the novice",Won't offer much to the established antrepreneur but for the novice this is a good book to start with. It is an easy read and is based on the author's belief that success can't happen unless you own a business.
2,kindle edition has poor illustrations,there are numerous simple line and block diagrams in this book but the publisher has not bothered to ensure they are legible on the kindle. further the diagrams can not be zoomed in this title. consequently most are frustratingly unreadable
4,Guide Book,Rich Dad Poor Dad is a great book to guide those of us who don't have the first clue about money and being rich. In this book we find the author giving advance through his own experiences in life and showing what good has come from it. Which is the way to do it.
4,The most important thing to know about RD/PD books...,"Realize that these books are Self Improvement books rather than Financial How-To's. If you think the former, you'll see how great they are for giving the average working middle-class person a whole new way of thinking. If you see these books as the latter, you'll be disappointed. This book, and others in the family, are great for instilling the courage into us average folk to make big financial moves. They're not number-crunching revelations. Take these books with the right attitude, and they'll do you much good."
2,Very sophomoric...,"I had hoped to actually get some insight from this book - yet it is so unrealistic and vague it doesn't help at all... Of course, owning your own corporation(s) is better then working for someone else... doesn't take rocket science to figure that out. Yet there is no insight on how this is accomplished.I'm dismayed that the author considered one father ""poor"" when that father obviously cared enough to teach and provide for his children... the writer wouldn't be someone I'd want to emulate or transpire to, sadly."
3,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"I thought this book was very insightful. I liked how Kiyosaki broke down the reasons why the rich are rich and why the poor are poor; what steps are needed to succeed in business. The insights of the author are very interesting as far as how you need to make money work for you, and not work for money. I thought this was a pretty good book."
2,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"As a self-proclaimed guide to escape the ""rat race"" of financial pattern, Rich Dad Poor Dad merely regurgitates the same drawn-out information for the duration of 197 pages. With oversimplified lessons, and unfulfilling anecdotes, Kiyosaki, forms no true basis for his arguments. He is quick to generalize the efforts needed for success by reducing the issue of poverty to a character flaw. He discredits entirely the value of education, by encouraging one's focus to be directed solely on becoming financially literate. It is quite interesting that this type of book was able to make its way to #1 on the bestseller list without others finding such errors in Kiyoski's reasoning."
2,Disappointing,"Within the first few chapters, I was intrigued but then the book went too much into having to own your own business/be your own boss to be successful. I understand that thinking but don't have the want or ambition to own my own company, even with the tax savings involved. This book helped to change my thinking about liabilities and assets, which was the biggest asset of the book! The essence of the book is to concentrate on accumulating assets (that which puts money in your pocket, money-earning; stocks, bonds, etc) instead of concentrating on accumulating liabilities which are non-money earning material items (car, house, electronics, etc). As quoted in the book, ""Keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently build a base of solid assets."" If you want a better financial guide suggestion, read Smart Couples Finish Rich by David Bach which gives much better guidance on investing and managing your money."
3,A Quick & Easy Read; It's Worth the Time,"We all will identify with one of the two dads...most of us with Poor Dad. For all but Generation X, we were told that a good education and a good job with a large, solid company were the keys to the good life and a secure future. Well, most of us now know that it just ain't so! Robert Kiyosaki tells us why we got where we are. The Kiyosaki/Lechter team certainly will not be remembered for their mastery of prose, but the book is worth its price for the graphic presentation of financial statements that will make it possible for us ""poor dads"" to fake it and explain personal finance and wealth-building to our children in ways they can understand. Who knows, it might also reorient our own thinking enough so we can reverse some of the effects of following bad advice ourselves."
3,This book opens your mind but it isn't the solution... I suggest reading it for perspective but continue your education,"This is a good book to start with. It opens your mind and begins the financial education process. The book is out of date and some of his ideas may have worked back in the 80s and 90s however post 2000 I would be hesitant in following his direction. The general purpose is clear and valuable however his tips on when, where, how, and why are way out of date (he admits that his examples are what he did and what he knows...not what you should do).I encourage people to read this book to learn and open their minds however I also encourage people to do further research and reading. He has a great list of suggested reading, and those authors also have lists of suggested reading. Keep learning and also go out there and try some of these techniques! You've got to fall off the bike a few times when learning how to ride it."
4,"Some very practical advice, but don't drink the Kool-Aide","I really enjoyed this book and Robert's story telling abilities enable his salesmanship to really get a grip on his readers, leaving them wanting more, and boy does he have more. Dozens of books, games, coaches, seminars. . . This guy is a money making machine, so don't get too wrapped up in his dogma or you'll be out a few grand before you know it. Great advice such as: things are only assets if they put money into your bank; and liabilities if they take money out. (like your house) A really phenomenal approach to money. The game is fun, but expensive. The computer version is really great. Be careful. It's a slippery slope!"
1,"rich dad, poor dad",It hard to see because the book is so tiny........... should mention it. not very happy about it. I could borrow the book from the library if I know was that small.........
4,Exceptional!,"I've heard friends talking about ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" and was simply curious to find out what all the talk was about. It truly opened my eyes to a ""new"" way of thinking. I believe anyone who reads this book will come away with a fresh perspective about what steps to take next! It was a great read!"
4,Only for beginners,"I can summarize this book in 5 incomplete sentences:1) Learn accounting and finance2) Setup a corporation for tax benefits3) Pay yourself first by investing in assets with your income4) Don't be afraid to take risks5) Hire people smarter than youIf you understand all-of-the-above, move on to read something else and save two hours of your life. If you do not, take that two hours of your life reading this book because this is a great starting point."
3,Standard stuff but an important attitude,"Though there's not a lot of specific wealth-building information here, it's a good start for those who never learned anything but--go to college, get a job, work hard. He has introduced many of those types to ideas like diversifying your income and not putting all your eggs in one basket, and that's always good. A better book for actually working through your personal financial situation is John Sestina's Managing to be Wealthy, which teaches those concepts and helps you apply them to your own life. Bonuses are more advanced stuff you can ask your financial planner when you actually get some money piling up!"
3,Very repetitive,"While I enjoyed this book it was a bit of a time waster. Perhaps the author wanted to make the book look bigger than it was, but he said the same things over and over again. This book could have been 1/3 the size if he would have been just a bit less verbose in his writing style. That said, it was an interesting book and certainly changed our approach to our finances. We have become fanatical about not touching assets, and learning new ways to increase our asset column while decreasing our liabilities column. I'm glad I read this book, but I wish I'd bought it used!"
3,Brief but on point,I did not expect the book to be that miniature. It really is. It will make a perfect gift for a 2 year old that can actually read. I like the fact that the book summarizes the CRITICAL POINTS and in short the take home message. If you just want to skip over the many details then buy this.
5,Great View,"Definitely a must read for those people who are seeking to get out of the ""rat race.""Awesome book. Anyone trying to ""make it big"" has got to read it"
5,Definitely NOT for Teenagers,"If some adults can't understand this great work by Kiyosaki, how can we expect our teenagers to understand it?No, instead, I would recommend Rich Dad's Rich Kid Smart Kid and then move them up to Rich Dad Poor Dad and Rich Dad's Success Stories after that.Great to see the the Rich Dad books are still best sellers and that intelligent people are NOT taking that single one star basher too seriously. Poor guy must have a very boring life!"
5,Excellent way to Wealth without Risk,"Rich Dad Poor Dad offers the philosophy and methods that helped turn Robert Kiyosaki into a multi millionaire. It also helped turn Roberts real Rich Dad into a incredible success as well.With job security at an all time low (J-O-B really stands for just over broke anyway), there never has been a better time to take control of your personal assets, take charge of your life and become a success. Rich Dad Poor Dad shows the way.Some other books that I recommend are Cash Flow Quadrant, More Wealth Without Risk and Super Self, the latter two by Charles J. Givens which are all about taking control. Super Self shows the way to becoming ""ten feet tall and bullet proof.""If you are looking for results, try reading Rich Dad Success Stories. Another winner."
2,Rich dad Poor Dad,"Some what dissatisfied with this book, the primary thesis is to become an independent business person. It did not present a balanced views of the risks."
3,rich dad poor dad,"Rich Dad Poor Dad has its good points and bad points. Robert Kiyosaki has amazing insights pertaining to the world of money and if followed, you may become a wealthy man/woman. Although he has a chapter to guide how one might put these ""philosophies"" into action, there is not adequate information on how to REALLY get started. For the most part, these guide points of Mr. Kiyosaki's are for the people that already have a substancial amount of money. It would be very hard to practice these techniques when you are already in a ""trap."" Also, it seems like Mr. Kiyosaki is trying to tell the reader that life is about money and he implies that one is not successful without money. It seems as if the underlying message of this book is to ""live for money"" and I disagree."
5,The book that has had the most impact on my life.,"This book is an excelent tool for opening a whole new world up to people who were told to ""Go to school and get good grades, so you can get a high paying job."" This book doesn't contain every grain of knowledge that is required to find your path in life, and you path to richness, but it does allow you to see that such a path exists and that it may not be the path that your parents took or the one that they encourage you to take. If this book affects you as it did me, you uncover an inner desire to be more than you are and energize you on your path to becoming more. I have bought and read books non-stop since reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad, about investing in traditional investments and investing in myself. This book has definately had and will continue to have a positive inpact on my life."
5,Rich Dad,"Kiyosaki delineates between employees, one-person business owners, business owners with employees, and investors. He gives a compelling argument for large business ownership by explaining tax disadvantages to the employee and time limitations to the one-person business practitioner. He also explains the value of investment. He doesn't advocate risky ventures, but does suggest strategies to move from employee and one-person business status to business ownership and investment status. He advocates creating positive cash flow, and is partial to income-producing real estate ownership which produces positive cash flow. This book could be retitled, Financial Freedom 101."
5,A Book That Contain Many Simple Tips We Often Condone,"It's a great read for all those who would like to increase their assets without sacrificing an arm and a leg. Kiyosaki presents his ideas with simple examples and an emphasis through charts/pictures. The charts really simplify things. Although Kiyosaki makes many of his experiences sound easy, it'll probably take some work and good timing for them to be attainable. I liked the ""two dad"" idea. It presented two opposite views and showed that many things in life can't be taught by a teacher and learned through a book. At times, the point kiyosaki tries to make can get really repetitive and agressive. Overall, it's a great book, if you want some advice on how to divide your paycheck better and get out of ""the rat race."" FIVE STARS!"
3,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"I think that this book was all around informative. Most of the examples that the author used to support his concepts about money were common sense. However, certain people may not have been fully aware till they actually read this book. I agree with the point he efficiently made across: ""you shouldn't work for money"" but you should have ""money work for you."""
4,Over Simplified but to the point,"The book brought up a lot of good theories, but they all sounded too simple. Though the book was a quick read, it was also so repetitive that at times I got bored with reading the same thought written for fifteen pages when it should have only taken up one. The simplicity and repetiveness helped me understand the overall picture, so I guess it is a good starting book when dealing with investments and money issues."
4,A risk most aren't willing to take,"Mr. Kiyosaki writes about being willing to take risks to become rich. That the common person will often have and miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime because of that fear. The fear of knowing you won't be secure. The book is very interesting especially for young adults who still have the ability to take chances and be able to recuperate from any of them quickly. The book does a good job of giving the reader an overview of what it takes to be rich. The steps seem too simple to be true. I learned the difference betwwen an asset and a liability, which according to Kiyosaki is an important step in making the write decisions to becoming rich and most importantly staying rich."
2,"Worked for him, not sure about everyone.","Although undoubtedly his techniques worked well for the author, I am more inclined to think his inate talents/abilities played a bigger part than the author might admit - I am skeptical that his teachings are going to work for the masses. Mainly I believe one has to start out with something in order to develop it into something more - otherwise it is an uphill battle that few can endure."
3,The TV special is better than the book.,"The TV special, which was responsible for my purchase of this book, was better and seemingly more informative than the actual book. How can that be? I thought the book was an easy read, but there were so many points repeated in it that it seemed like it could be condensed into a length half as long. Also, the author continues to compare and contrast between his ""two dads,"" but not everyone has had a similar experience and can relate. Obviously, there is 5-star financial advice to be had here, but I'm not so sure that you will read this book twice to get it."
1,"I'm now a few dollars poorer, and feel cheated.","This book is a waste of time, I can't comprehend why it had so much attention, if you expect to get relevant tips from it, you might be quite disappointed because most if it is common sense.I assumed, it would be straight to the point, but instead the whole intro is biography-like. He takes you all the way back to his childhood, and its like a walk down memory lane.Half way through the book I realized he had only made a few points, though still taking you through the memory walk. I was so dissapointed, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.I doubt most people will end up richer, but it might be motivational, though leaving u without a blue print. Goodluck."
1,LIKE EATING COTTON CANDY WHILE STANDING ON A CLOUD,"This ... thing was a collosal waste of money and featured page after page of sheer ..., i.e. and rambling platitudes, that I don't think I divined a single piece of worthwhile information other than the fact that the author likes Johnny Holmes and Ginger Lynne movies, which is a weird thing for him to mention, but to each his own. I'm surprised he didn't have a forward by Ron Jeremy. Basically, the author could have put all of the meaty worthwhileness of the book onto one post-it note, and that is buy low sell high. Thank you. Goodbye..."
1,Poor Book,"I have a difficult time saying anything positive about this book. Yes, if you are looking to make money, it makes sense to attempt to gather enough assets that can support your lifestyle. However, the author makes it sound as if this is very easy and also makes outlandish claims, including that his net worth fluctuates between $50 and $100 million in a given day. There is no investment out there with such large volatility, as far as I know. Also, I cannot in good faith say anything positive about a book that basically advocates insider trading. There is really no solid information in this book for how to go about building wealth."
1,Don't buy this book,"I read this book many years ago and I can agree with some of the concepts he teaches... However, buyer beware that this book is little more than the same kind of gimmick that lures people into multi-level marketing schemes all the time - it promises to teach you how to get rich without working a job the rest of your life. The truth is that it is a gateway into sucking you into buying more and more and more of the author's products and services. Just like multi-level marketing, most of the money to be made is the money made by those peddling the products promising to teach you how to get rich quick. Don't buy into it."
3,Kind of a basic message but probably still worth reading,"This is one of those books that when you're finished reading, you'll say to yourself ""this is mostly common sense"" but it is still worth reading since it helps to reinforces what we already know. Even with the other negative reviews, the book does show you some of the basics of building a foundation for gaining wealth. There are many concepts in the book but I think the main takeaway of the book is the simple saying ""don't try to keep up with the Jones'"". Too many people get caught up trying to impress friends and family rather than focusing on their own personal situation. There are other tips but it is a quick read and is still worth reading."
4,Good book,"I have not finished this book yet but I am very involved in it, and hope to learn a lot from it."
1,Disappointed.,Expected to receive full size book. Instead got a baby version. Guess I'd better read the fine print next time.
2,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad: the book that could have been under 10 pages.","I just finished listening to the ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" yesterday. I had pretty high expectations for this book, as I just recently heard it being mentioned on the radio in Ottawa.The book can be summarized into these few words: the rich buy assets that generate money, and poor buy liabilities that cost them money. Also, the rich don't pay taxes by hiding behind corporations.Well, that's pretty much it. All the rest in the book is a filler."
5,I only wish that I had read Robert's book in high-school.,"This is a must read book for everyone but more importantly it is a must-make your children read book for parents. As a parent from the boom-generation you have a finacial, parental and moral obligation to read this book with your children. If I had had this book in high-school I would have more assets, less liabilities and would have known to pay myself first. Because of this book I have begun to look seriously at my life and for the first time I can see the end of the cycle. This book should be given a sixth star and I would like to thank Robert for enlightening me about the world and for teaching me how to make money work for me. I love this book, and I love Robert for sharing it with me. Stuart Smith infinity6@hotmail.com I hope to meet you someday Robert to shake your hand and say Thank You!"
5,RichDadPoorDad,"This is a very amazing book, I think it should be on everyone's to-do list. Very good reading and I would challenge anyone to read it and not agree with what is said."
4,Worth the Hype,"I always heard of this book but thought it was probably overrated. First of all, I'd like to point out - just in case you didn't know - this has nothing to do with being a father. The explanation of the book is below that. That may seem obvious to some people, but if you don't remember this book coming out, I've found that some people are unaware of this fact.Secondly, it's a quick and interesting read. Rather you agree with everything the author has to say or not, it's worth the read (and the price) because it gives a unique perspective. His views on stocks, in particular, are not what most people would agree with. However, the general premise - and a lot of the views on how to achieve ""success"" in life are worth examining. If nothing else, this book will provoke some thought and that's what made me feel was worth the purchase."
4,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"This book is very well written. It simply describes the ways to make money. It provides simple pictures to help the reader to comprehend what the author is describing. There are also many short stories that help to keep the reader attentive and drawn into the book. The stories are also very helpful in understanding the concepts presented.Even though the book is very well written, it also seems to be very repetitive. The repetition may be used to have the messages sink into the readers' brains, but it is a little much. The same points seem to be made over and over again instead of moving on to new topics.It is an entertaining book and I recommend it to anyone interested in money. Robert Kiyosaki really makes the reader think about money and how to earn it. Money does not necessarily flow to those that went to many years of college. It just depends how much knowledge the person has of how to earn and keep earning the money."
3,Rich and Poor?,"I think this book was interesting, and was very informative as to how one shouild invest their money. However, it could make you think you do not need an education to succeed which I disagree with. Even if someone succeeds or not they should be educated anyway. At least now we know there is another way to make money without education."
4,Sound Financial Advice,"This is an very good book for the financially illiterate (that's me before reading this book)! It teaches about ways to make your money work for you. It is a useful book with lots of practical advice that make a lot of sense and is also a very enjoyable book to read. In a way this book worked for me, it gave me insights about my attitudes towards money and my patterns of spending which were not working for me! And although I did not become a millionaire (yet!), I handle my finances in a much better way. If you don't know ways to save and invest your money, or you're afraid to start, this book will be very helpful."
2,Are you kidding,"I gave this 2 stars because the only reason to read it is to read the in depth analysis found on John T. Reed's website...This is an amway/quixtar marketed book reinvented in a fictional (yes, fictional) forum. Stay clear, as the book is clealry directed at people looking to get rich quick. C'mon. If it was as easy as this guy says, wouldn't everyone do it? The book was written to sell to people looking to get rich who probably are far from it, and judging from the reviews on this website the brainwashing has apparently worked."
2,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","Overall, I thought that Rich Dad, Poor Dad was not so rich in content, and rather poor in writing. The author of this book did not do a good job of putting all of his thoughts together in this badly written book. One thought seemed to jump from the next without any connection. Furthermore, the ideas and lessons presented in this book seemed rather obvious to me, and it was hard to understand why someone would need to read such a book at all, for everything in it seemed to be nothing more than common sense. I do not reccomend this book to anyone who truley wants to learn how to manage their finances."
2,Disappointing,"I bought the CD version of the book. Overall, it was disappointing. Too many cliches. Too redundant. Parts of stories and examples did not seem to tie together. He made it seem like it was noble to go bankrupt and sleep in a car. However, it was not fully explained how he went bankrupt in the first place. If he had been following his ""Rich Dad's"" advice since he was 9 years old, what happened? I started to replay the CD to gather examples of the excessive use of cliches, but decided it was not worth my time to listen to the CD again. To be fair, I have been told that the book is better than the CD. Maybe the CD left out some parts that would have made the book worth reading."
5,False Paradigm,"Robert Kiyosaki does an excellent job of raising our financial awareness- challenging us to examine the very way we think about ""getting ahead"". Working harder at a j.o.b. is NOT the answer, and I found his reasoning to be very sound. Basic concepts like understanding the difference between an asset and a liability, and the difference between money working for me- and me working for money, have opened my eyes to the false paradigm I USED to prescribe to.This book is a must for anyone who desires real financial freedom. I'm grateful to Robert for sharing his wisdom, and grateful for the friend who recommended the book!"
4,Motivated,"My husband had originally purchased and read the book, he was so inspired and excited by the information that I was encouraged to do so too (I purchased the book on cassette). I feel this book is written in a way that inspires you to do better for yourself and your children. While I will still encourage our children to get a good education - now I will also encourage them to be diligent in educating themselves about money as well. I am hopeful that my husband and I (with further education) can teach our children about money (assets vs. liabilities) by example. I will highly recommend this book to everyone I know that is interested in doing better for themselves financially. You should know that no one thing/book could ever be the answer, but this book is a great place to start and gives you a lot of food-for-thought."
3,"Good Points, Vague Information, Light in Content","I read this book translated in Korean.If you read any financial book, you would find yourself not too much impressed by this book. If not, then you will be.The book is a collection of writings of Kiyosaki, but written by Lechter, so there is not a good order of organizing informaion. That might disappoint many readers.The main idea of this book is easy to understand, and the rich dad's teaching is valuable. You read this book for these points.After reading, you will find that you like to play Cashflow 101 & 202 game. It is available at eBay. How expensive they are! But you could be inspired to play that game after reading this book.In conclusion, I will give 3 stars if you ever know personal finance; if not, the book is worth 4 stars for you."
3,Kiyosaki's advice only applicable to some,"Kiyosaki offers some wonderful advice, and illustrates it fairly well using asset and liabilities T-charts. However, his ""get rich quick"" and ""escape the rat pack"" advice is nowhere near applicable to the general population. His guidelines are useful for the rich - who want to get richer. He outlines lucrative business ideas well - though taking an excessive amount of time to get to his points, and is quite repetitive. Kiyosaki offers some interesting business and investing tips - but just takes too long to get to them. However, these ideas are pertinent to the wealthy and upper-middle classes - individuals that are capable of investing large sums of money in new stock options and real estate - who are looking to gain some additional capital."
1,"High on hype, short on details.","There is an article in SmartMoney's February 2003 edition that has shed some light on this ""Karma Chameleon"". That is not an easy feat as very little that Kiyosaki claims to have achieved in his books can be verified. Before buying any of his books, it may be wise to read the SmartMoney article and this online analysis of Kiyosaki. The Rich Dad in his books may not even exist. This was his response in the SmartMoney article, ""Is Harry Potter real? Why don't you let Rich Dad be a myth, like Harry Potter?"". His books may get you thinking about your finances but without any concrete advice to guide you, the only person you are making wealthy is Robert Kiyosaki."
2,"Money is free.....or, is it?","This is probably the worst personal finance book I have ever read. I almost gave up after page 20. The style and flow is horribly kindergarten and the ideas so rudimentary that it's hard to believe anyone agreed to print it.RDPD contains a very basic thread which tells you to maximise your asset growth to cover your outgoings (duh!) and then goes on to tell you something about how Kiyosaki became a millionaire. Exactly what is true and how one should start geting rich is pretty hazy. Financial details are thin and his methods vague at best.It's more of a motivational perk-me-up than a useful guide to making money and achieving financial independence. If there is something positive to come out of the book, it's Kiyosaki's constant preaching that a house is just as much a liability as an asset and buying the family home early on in life can seriously impede your ability to achieve financial independence through leveraging your balance sheet."
2,"Lots of motivation, almost no practical advice","Take a look at the wide range of reviews here.. lots of fives, and lots of ones. The fives are high on the motivation from the book. The ones were looking for practical advice, and found none. This book WILL motivate you to improve your financial situation, but it will probably leave you wondering where to start. You should really only buy one of the books in his series if you are really interested. It doesn't matter which, because they all keep repeating the same things over and over. He will probably be pumping out books full of filler information until he dies.You will also notice at the beginning of all of his books ""Although based on a true story, certain events in the book have been fictionalized for educational content and impact."" So, in other words, he makes up nonsense stories to try to sell you his ideas."
1,This guy is a con man!,"John T Reed says it best - ""I am extremely skeptical as to whether he has done or seen many of the investment things he claims to have done or seen. He claims to be an experienced, millionaire, real-estate investor, yet the book is full of statements that I would expect only from a rather ignorant, not very bright, novice, investor wannabe."" ...""Kiyosaki is primarily a creature of Amway and other multi-level marketing organizations. Reportedly, his books were not selling until he allied himself with that crowd."" Read about the real Robert Kiyosaki: http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html"
1,"Seminar fluff, a whole lot of nothing","This book is nonsense. The ""tone"" of the writing is condescending and repetitive. It's like reading a motivational speech at one of those money-making scam seminars. As others have mentioned, the author's veracity is in question regarding the facts of his life. I do not believe there is a ""Rich Dad"", personally. I don't think we should line the pockets of this guy. I STRONGLY urge you to do a search on the author's name on Google or any good search engine, and maybe add in the modifier ""criticism"" or ""MLM"". If I could save just one person from wasting their money on this book, I'll be pleased. Oh, and telling people not to bother with an education? Pinhead advice."
1,Worthless,"It's all in the packaging. The author even admitted that he wasn't a very good writer, but knew how to sell a product. He gave an example of another book which sold millions because it had a provocative title. I find this out halfway through this book with a provocative title! In other words, I just helped him make more money, but I learned nothing. Do not waste your money on this book."
1,Its so tiny,This particular book is no bigger than your palm. I wish they would have given the dimensions for the actual size of the book
2,redundant fluff that is redundant and fluffy,"Here's the substance of the entire book:1. Be smart about investing and keep looking for better opportunities for your money.2. Take advantage of the power of compound interest.3. Learn elsewhere how to make clever business decisions.4. Follow these simple rules, and ""you too"" can become rich without working hard.Open the book, read the first or last 10 pages and put it back on the shelf. From there, you'll be motivated to learn about finance without wasting your time reading the same stuff twenty times over."
4,Useful,"You will not get rich in one night, but you will learn how money works, the easy way. I found it useful because I learned how to see money with a different type of glasses. I began to change the way I invested my savings, no matter the economic times. How money works is not taught in college, you should find advise from the experienced and this is a good source."
1,Infomercial disguised in a book.,"This book has some good ideas, but it seems to be more of an infomercial for the author's $300 board game. NO board game is worth $300! Give me a break!"
2,"Take his advice, and save your cash.",To sum it up. Save your money. Invest it in assets. Do not spend more than you have. Duh.The potential knowledge you could derive from this book would be less than that of a typical high school education. Author spends a good portion of the book pimping his other wares. It was a waste of my time.
1,Not what you think it is.,"This book is the most repetitive, meandering scribble I have ever read. If you have the philosophy to invest your money in something that gives you a return, then you don't need this book. This is not a how-to book."
2,Only one good thing,Overall this book left a bad taste in my mouth. The childhood story is obviously untrue. I unfortunately did research on Kiyosaki and his book after I bought it.There are much finer books about becoming financially independant out there. Your Money or Your Life is a fine example. I would give it the lowest rating of one star except that he does make a point that your house/mortgage is a liability which I highly agree with.Most of what he writes about is covered in other books which are written MUCH better.
2,Nothing new,"Every now and then I buy one of these ""...everyone is talking about it !"" books. They are all the same: ""Want to get rich ? find someone desperate selling real estate, buy it cheap (no money down if you can), and wait. Dont get into consumer debt."" etc. You do not need a book to tell you that and there is nothing new about real estate (or other financial) speculation. Some people get rich because they work hard, others because they are smart and many because they get lucky. Read it if you want but do not count on it to change your life. By the way, if you can become half the salesman that Kiyosaki is then you can count on becoming rich !"
5,Easy and funny,"that book is not just for learning about the financial aspects of life, it is about life and how we go through it. I highly recommend it."
1,Waste of money to buy this book,"This is a book that makes only a few points and takes forever to get to those points. Totally unnecessary long worded stories, lots of page-filling graphs and attempts to bash the rich. This books seems to be targeted to people wanting to be rich but hating the already rich. There are many other, better books out there that provide sound financial advice, don't waste your money with this book."
3,Worth the money..,"you won't get rich by reading the book, but it definitely reminds you of some important things for your own financial management."
1,Too much space between the covers,"This book is the perfect example of one that should have been an article. An editing fiasco. There are interesting ideas presented, but the personal anecdotes take up the majority of the space and have truly no pedagogical value. Most are barely coherent and hardly interesting. Plus, for all his statements on how important it is to develop financial intelligence, he does a poor job explaining how to do it, and provides no fundamental knowledge for the reading of valuable texts like, for example, the Wall Street Journal. Save yourself the money--borrow it from the library, or skip it altogether."
1,This is a joke,"This book is a joke. It does provide a ""revolutionary"" idea that is just what many people want to hear, i.e. ""don't work for your money."" This is highly useful for the author in that it gets people to buy the book and buy copies for their friends. (afterall *he* certainly is not working for his money)The truth is, his line of self help personal finance junk is just a small step up from the trinkets he was selling before- he is merely capitalizing on another fad.Everyone wants to believe that there are some ""secrets"" that the rich must know, and this provides a nearly irresistable urge to read the book. Resist."
5,"Powerful, life changing program","A few months ago, I was working in sales for a B>B Business Group. I followed Mr. Kiyosaki's advice and started investing my money in passive income. I bought some equities, a rental or two and started a home based business.While my colleagues spent their checks and worked for ThankGodItsFriday and cheer for Wednesdays because it was ""hump day"" and yell hooray for the weekend, and then made wise cracks about my goals. I invested, left that company over 6 weeks ago and am now full time in my own business. Meanwhile, my colleagues were recently served notice that their company (my former company) is laying off 150 people!Thank God for Robert Kiyosaki."
1,Watch the Infomercial instead,"This book was not only poorly written and edited, but there was no real content. This was a typical infomercial, with the caveat that you buy his $200.00 game board -- that's what is really disturbing. Atleast Robbins and Ziglar are upfront with their stories. I would not waste the money on this book. Read anything but this."
1,there are far better books,"A long time ago I read the great short book, How to Get Rich and Stay Rich by Fred Young. To get rich, Fred says you can:1. Inherit it2 Marry it3. Make more money than you spend and invest the difference.Since 1 and 2 are out for most people, he recommends 3.And that, in one sentence, is better advice than the whole bloated RDPD pep talk.You can spend years researching and becoming a good investor. It's not nearly as easy as this author implies. There are many good books and authors to guide you. Peter Lynch, John Swenson, and yes, John Reed, if you are willing to WORK at the real estate BUSINESS. And it's not an easy business.This guy is just the latest ""it's easy to be rich"" guy. And how does one get rich? One buys the many products and seminars that the guy has for sale at absurdly high prices.For free, you can learn all about real estate, stocks, bonds, and owning a business, all at your public library. That is what I would recommend instead."
2,Not much substance,"Vague, general, rambling. There are a few solid nuggets of advice, but they are far between. This book is little more than a pep talk for absolute beginners. If you're older than about 22, or if you have any experience at all in business or investing, this book probably is not for you."
3,Sits on the border of helpful or story sharing.,"If your looking for a story to give you the ""get rich"" perspective, this is your book. It sets the mental can-do platform and a little something extra to get you on your way. If your looking for sturdy financial wrungs for your ladder, this book suggests ways but falls short of details. For those details, you must buy . . . next book, see the lecture, and so forth.Look at the number of pages: 184. You won't find the road mapto success, here. You might find a nudge. For a good laugh andan interesting sci-fi adventure try ""Damsel in the Rough"" by Tempesta. There are nudges there too."
1,Sold Out,"Did not get this book as seller stated he was out of stock, no promise to restock, did not reorder from another source."
5,Pleased!,I bought this book for my boyfriend. I bought it used but it looks brand spankin new. Beautiful. I am very pleased with it. It came in just a few days too. No waiting around!
2,Can't communicate to save theirselves,"Easy read-18 minutes & spelling and grammer errors are throughout. Plus, pure money making ""Dribble"". Follow this & you LOOSE!"
1,Find another,There are several financial authors available on Amazon offering real guidance. The best currently are Dave Ramsey and Ric Edelman.Kiyosaki's message is complete BS. I should have Googled Kiyosaki before I bought Rich Dad. Don't waste your money too.Start here: www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html
1,fluff-filled advertisement for game,"this book is full of ""fluff"", anecdotal stories stretched out into full chapters that exploit greed and fear of the reader to ultimiately promote the ""Cashflow 101/202"" games, (monopoly-like spin-off), which are very expensive. if you get rid of the fluff, the bottom line is: invest in stock options, bonds, notes and real estate. this book was written in 1998, during the golden years of dot-com startups, (before they had to actually turn a profit). it doesn't tell you anything about what they are, just that they are a good investment, while buying a house or getting an education is a bad investment. to learn how to actually put this in practice, you have to buy a game, which comes with audio tapes or video tapes and cost 100's of dollars. the book claims it is revolutionary, but it isn't."
4,Review for Rich Dad Poor Dad,I got the book RICH DAD POOR DAD by Robert Kiyosaki as per the recommendation of my professor in the IEM course that I am attending at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. This book is a good read for all people in general and also to persons who have just started their financial planning. It documents what the author learnt from his two dads one of whom was financially rich and the other one was educated but financially poor. He tells you how having financial education is as important as having a regular education. Throughout the book he lays importance on assets and liabilities by telling you how acquiring assets help you improve your finances. He also lays emphasis on the fact that we should develop all round abilities instead of focusing in one area. The points that I have mentioned have been well covered by examples in the book.
1,Worthless Drivel,"The only way to describe this ""book"" is as a collection of useless drivel. Seriously! I found nothing in this book to be of any real value - all you get from Kyosaki is a lot of chest beating and tall talk, but you get little to no actual INFORMATION.This is one of those inspirational ""you can do it if you decide to do it"" books, which is big on promises but is very short on real advice that can be followed.I am actually pretty surprised by the number of positive comments. I can only surmise that (a) we were each reading a different book; or (b) that some of these positive reviews were not written by actual readers.Do yourself a favor: if you want to get rich, start by doing some real research. Set yourself some actual goals and then go meet them. Do not waste your time reading useless collections of fiction, which is what this book is."
3,Interesting concept but does it REALLY work!?,"My boyfriend brought this concept to my attention afterI asked him why he was living way below his income andbeing a cheap a_ _ on our dates. He said he was tryingto be ""smart"" with his money. It is a way to get peopleto think you are selfish and get them to hate you. Theconcepts that this guy presents are interesting, but..really, how many of you without good credit and no moneyactually have opportunities to buy investments. Goodinvestments? I mean really? That is fantasy if you ask me.In the real world you have to have ""some"" money are goodcredit in order to buy investments. Don't you? My boyfriendhas bought into this in hopes of quitting his job. I thinkhe's lazy and selfish. I hope he succeeds, but I'm notreal hopeful at this point in that or our relationship!"
4,Get yourself out of the ratrace,"This is a clear, bright book to inspire and give courage to those who want out of the ratrace but don't know how to accomplish it. Well written, fast read. Great stories illustrate well grounded points."
1,keep the poor kids away from this one,"if you've seen one of these ""get rich quick"" books, you've seen them all. Basically, a bunch of oversimplifications and questionable (at best) investment advice (a house is a liability?)."
1,"Complete Crap, has the workings of a cult franchise","I know that I can't do the bashing of this... as well as I'd like, so I'll leave it to the people on these two webpages-there are other webpages, but two's enough for now.SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
3,May just get you thinking.,"This book seems to me to have little new information in it. I enjoyed reading it because it got me thinking about possibilities and I am now researching those possibilities in depth. It seems that most people will come away from this book thinking that you can go buy a bunch of property and get rich. It's actually a little more tricky than that.This book speaks in generalities. If you want an in-depth, how-to book on becoming wealthy this is not it. It is a jumping off point for me. It made me think about my million-dollar idea and how to make it a million dollar reality. I am now looking at authors like John Maxwell, Zig Ziglar, Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill and others to build my skills.This book is good, in that it may inspire you to look at possibilities. If you just need a start, check out Rich Dad, Poor Dad."
2,It's an ok book. Not worth the time and price,"This book is too ""diluted"". I agree with another reviewer that reading this book is like drinking one cup of milk mixed with 10 cups of water - you have to read some long stories to get basically ONE idea out of ""Dad"". I also read ""The Millionaire Next Door"". ""Millionaire"" is a much better book than ""Dad"". It has most of the information that ""Dad"" has minus those long and repeated lines. I also agree that Robert is more trying to ""sell himself"". His ""rich dad poor dad"" approach starts to annoy me after I went through about a quarter of the book.Read ""The Millionaire Next Door"", I liked it so much that I sent it to my father in Malaysia after finished reading it. I am not going to do the same with ""Dad""."
3,Not As Good,"Rich Dad Poor Dad is a monotonous collection of useless jargon.Instead of the author wasting page after page to get his obvious point across, he should have saved precious paper and cut it down to one senence. Even in mother goose rhymes the point or moral of the story is consciously hidden by a good author until the end."
4,A VERY GOOD READ,A very interesting book from a different perspective. The author expresses not so authentic ideas in a different light. I think everyone can benefit from this book.
5,Great life lesson,Things that you need to do in order to better organize your life and have a better future. This is a must read.
4,Great book,This book makes me to stop for a while in a crazily busy world and start to mind my own business.
1,The most tedious book every written... Could be 6 pages long,"This book is an example of how to say the same thing six hundred different ways. It's the most simplistic, boring writing I've encountered in about 10 years. The first third of the book is the single most tedious reading I've endured (I promised a friend I would read this book - now I get to berate him), period."
2,Where's the BEEEFFFF?,Kinda like all the hype with the new Star Wars movie...only to be left alone at the altar...good for Robert...he just made more money from the poort!
5,"A ""MUST HAVE"" for Steely Dan fans!!",This fabulous collection of Steely Dan songs is definitely worth the price! It is the only CD I've found that has all of my favorite Steely Dan songs on it. The songs included on this CD are:1) Reelin' in the Years 2) Rikki Don't Lose That Number 3) Peg 4) FM 5) Hey Nineteen 6) Deacon Blues 7) Black Friday 8) Bodhisattva 9) Do it Again 10) Haitian Divorce 11) My Old School 12) Midnite Cruiser 13) Babylon Sisters 14) Kid Charlemagne 15) Dirty Work 16) Josie
5,GREAT CD!,"This is one of the best CD's I've ever had. I love every song on it and that's saying a lot. My only ""complaint"" is that I have trouble setting the base and treble where it's just right but that may have to do with them being older songs and then remastered. Sometimes too much treble on the background music and I can't get it adjusted right. But I try to overlook because the songs are awesome!!"
4,A Different Kind of Western,"Estleman brings a modern sensibility to the western format. His heroes are flawed, his villains love their mothers, and the girls are far from pure. He takes the western story places it has seldom been before, in this case into the opium dens of old San Francisco's Barbary Coast. Few western writers have Estleman's command of the language, inventiveness or creative plotting. All of that aside, the stories are a great pleasure to read, and this is one of his best."
5,simply delightful,"I found this book at my local independent bookseller. Liked the cover. Bought it, sat down to read it and was transported into one of those alternate realities that I prefer. I loved the characters, the quotations, a literate mind at work...Now I want a sequel!"
3,Dragon,"I loved her other books that she has written, this one was ok,,, but nothing like the others...."
4,Definitely one for Any Fanstasy Fan,"This book is wonderfully written and it involves the reader in the life of the main character, I dropped everything else I was doing and started reading it immediately, and finished it the next morning when I couldn't keep my eyes open and had to go to sleep. The themes are interesting and novel and for once a story about someone who is is not mentally stable is told in a way that makes the rest of the world seem disturbed. If you're a fantasy fan or a fan of excellent writing, I definitely recommend reading this novel"
4,Best Baseball Game Ever,"Thanks to the real Big Shot (Potomac Cannons), this game is great. I've seen the Big Shot's baseball game since 1994, and I'm gonna play this game in 2004, ten years from when I've seen the real baseball game."
1,Same old boring high heat,Terrible graphics. Weak framerate. Buggy. Boring gameplay. All adds up to do not purchase.
3,Not worth the wait,"I was truly disapointed with this game. I expected to be blown away by the game play and the graphics, only to be let down. Its not a bad game, but I just wasn't impressed. The pitching is super slow, even when sped up. The camera angles on home runs dosen't allow you to see the ball leave the field. The crowd noise is on a loop. You hear chears for a while, then a sharp stop in noise for a half second, then the crowd starts up again. Again play is not awful, but I just expected better graphics, better simulation and better audio."
3,Decent at best,Pros: 1. High Heat is on Xbox!2. The great simulation engine comes along with itCons: 1. No Improvements at all on the gameplay2. About the worst graphics i've ever seen on the Xbox3. Sound and announcers are humdrum and repetitive4. Menu system is too complex to begin with5. Market system needs tuning6. Potential to be a great game gone to waste.FINAL VERDICT: just a rental. Not worth the [$$$]fee to buy it. But baseball fanatics will find it interesting
1,Pick Another Game,"The game is full of problems..players walk through players, choppy gameplay, repetitive announcers, and boring gameplay. Another problem is when your the batter, you have no control of your batter. All you can do is swing and bunt and you have no control over where your bat is or the position of your stance. Please rent this game before buying."
2,Bad buy for me,"Poached eggs are not hard to make, but using this makes it seem so.Hot steam burning your fingers;Egg cups too small for larger size chicken eggs;An economy of size requiring precise alignment to use the lid;Watch them like a hawk, yet somehow eggs are more done then they should beInstead of this, put eggs in a pot of tap water, bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes, longer if you prefer. That's the better way to make poached and soft-boiled eggs.If you are concerned with cracking shells, three tricks science can't explain but experience says will work, are:1. Put a spoon, fork or similar utensil in the water2. Salt the water3. Add olive oil to the water so it coats the eggMy egg poacher is going in the Goodwill bag."
2,Basic information,"This is an OK book for a beginner who knows little or nothing about networking. It does describe the various types of home networking available today, with a lot of information about wireless technologies. It could have been better organized by covering ethernet and wireless in separate sections. It is neither very clear for one getting started in home networking nor very helpful for one with basic knowledge who is looking to establish a more complex home network. It is an easy read and the ""tips"" inserts are helpful--really the best informative parts of the book. However, unless you are brand new to computers and networking, that is about all that is useful. Otherwise, save your money."
1,Garage versions,"Save your money! May be the original artists, but sounds more like the practice album made before the final product. Very disappointing."
1,Save your money,"I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought this book and exam CD. I had studied with the Crosswind series of materials by Tony Johnson, including his simulation exam CD, and the Rita book. I wanted to validate with another exam simulation source that I really knew the material versus memorizing the answers. I thought this was a good value - 4 exams for $30.00. I found the questions long and extremely wordy and confusing. It blew my confidence. Thankfully another person in my study group assured me that the test questions were formatted similar to the questions on the Crosswinds exam CD. I discarded this CD and concentrated on the materials I had from Crosswind. The exam answers refer you back to the Sybex book for clarification. The Crosswind exam provides clear information on the answers and refers you to the page in the PMBOK if necessary. The Crosswind exam CD recaps by knowledge area what you need to concentrate on and you can retest by a specific area."
2,INSANELY DIFFICULT,"The questions in this book are insanely difficult. If you can even get a passing mark on these sample exams you'll do just fine on the PMP exam. In my own case, I scored about 15 points higher on the actual PMI exam versus the 4 sample exams in this book.If you have unfortunately purchased the book my recommendation is to focus on understanding why you got questions wrong, and for questions that you are unsure of but still guess correctly thoroughly understanding why the answer was correct."
3,Not the best,"I bought this along with about everything else available for the PMP. The biggest problem I had with the book was the test. They were invalid, too difficult. I finaly took the advice of my PMP frineds, focused on Rita's Books and Practice test and passes very easily. One reason I decided to go back and comment here was that before I took the PMP I let this lady's practice test blow my confidence. Again, too hard. If searching for PMP material, stay w/RMC. . ."
1,A waste of money,"This material is not accurate and poorly structured. Don't waste your time, unless you have a lot of it to spend on figuring out what the questions were aimed for--I've used better tools out there than this one."
2,Could be better,"I've found three questions in the first exam alone where the answers must be inaccurate - in one case the comment explaining the answer is clearly refering to another question, or an earlier version of the question.In general the comments explaining the answers are very short and not very rich in content, so not so useful as a study tool.The user interface to the on line tests sometimes requires scolling to read the full text of a question, very distracting. And it does not let you take tests by knowledge areas."
2,Not meant for backpackers,"When I decided on buying this book over the standard travel books, like the Lonely Planet series, I was looking for something different and perhaps more personal it its descriptions. This book is certainly informative and includes personal descriptions (often at the sacrifice of more usable information), but it really didn't do a good job of representing what I saw in Mongolia. The price estimates were extremely over-inflated (a welcome surprise), and the maps didn't help at all. I suspect this book is meant for a different type of traveler, and not the young backpacker set which I was among in Mongolia. Its still a good read, but should not be the lone source of travel info. about this magnificent country."
4,The Bradt travel guide for Mongolia,"While providing good information for things that have not changed, the book is out of date. For those seeking to visit Mongolia in the near future, you will need additional up to date sources. Having said that there is a lot on information in this well organized guide such as history, geography, places to visit, to name only a few.W. Klein"
4,Relatvistic Gravitation,"Relativistic Gravitation exceeded all my expectations for what I wanted to learn. I am only fifteen years old so i thought that an introduction would take me into this field of physics. I understood most of the book, except for the math. I thought it would help if he took the reader throug the math. This subject is incredibly interersting and the author did a great job."
4,Watchmen on the Walls; Fight for Israel's Independence,"Hannah Hurnard went to Israel in 1932 and lived through the war for and acquisition of independence for the new nation in 1948; Actual accounts of the hardships and miracles of living through the war. Her resolve was monumental. A book that leaves you thinking, ""How would I have lived through it?"""
5,Great Book!,Hannah Hurnard's account of the turbulent times in Israel's earliest days makes for excellent reading as well as excellent research material. Her account centers on the siege of Jerusalem. This book is also fair to both sides in the Middle East conflict.
2,Hurnard's belief on God rather than a history book.,"This book is a little misleading. This is supposed to tell of the eyewitness account of the siege of Jerusalem and the birth of Israel. This is what it says on the cover, but in fact, most of the book talks about Hurnard's belief in God. It even goes into Biblical prophesy on the second coming when Israel was reborn. At least half of the book is devoted to Hurnard's belief. This is what I hate about born again people, they feel they have all the answers and the rest of us are pagans. Hurnard writes very little about what happened to her during the siege. She recounts stories about the shells and bombings of her neighborhood, but other than that, not much else.The reader interested in the birth of Israel should avoid this book. This is a book about faith, and is more at home in the religion section."
4,Photo Album Organizers,"Of the 6 that I ordered I received one that had the first couple of pages torn in half. It was only one album, so it wasnt worth returning. Would like to be able to specify color(sage or perewinkle) when I order, as I alternate album color each year. I feel sure there are many other users who do the same( I have 3 friends who use the same album and do the same thing.) They are the reason I started using these albums. Michaels Craft store stopped selling them so I found them on the internet via Amazon. If Amazon cannot give me the color I need then I will probably see if I can find them elsewhere.Since I was unable to specify color, I received 5 sage and 1 blue. I really needed more blue. It would be nice to be able to specify the color, especially since they only come in two colors."
5,Great Photo Storage,"After not being able to find this product in my local stores anymore; I searched online and Amazon.com was the only place to sell them; thankfully. I use these albums for all my photo storage. They hold 4x6 pictures or smaller. I have 20+ already (besides the ones I ordered from here). I don't need to worry about the color; all of mine are different; but I do like the colors in this particular assortment. It's a great product that I will always use! I save a lot of space and store my many photos.Edited August 2010: Unfortunately, these have not been sold on Amazon for a long time. If you need these albums, a similar version is sold at [...]. They still are a wonderful photo storage idea; I must have over 40 albums! Now I just need to develop more of my digital pictures!"
3,product description?,I cannot tell from this product overview what size photos it holds. 4x6? 3x5? 5x7? 8x10? None of the product reviews seem to say either. Looks great but I cannot really tell what I'm ordering when I order this.
3,RTX DUAL Jack RTX3241S,"This wireless phone jack is used to hook up to our satelite TV's. It works fine. The only problem we experienced is the confusing instructions for setting it up. Once we got it figured out, everything worked fine and it is way better than having to hard wire a new phone jack and it can be moved between satelite receivers."
5,Wireless Jacks for Dummies,What can I say. Fully operational within 2 minutes of opening the package. Bought this to facilitate Pay per View with DirecTV and it works perfectly!
1,Dead in less than a year,"I purchased this product in March of 2008 to connect a fax machine to a phone jack in another room. For almost a year, everything was fine, when suddenly the fax machine could not get a dial tone. I tested the unit, using a regular phone connected to the extension, and can only hear a short ""screech"" - no dial tone. I am unable to find the manufacturer online to find a way to troubleshoot further or repair.When it worked, I gave this product 5 stars for easy of connection and use. As a long-term solution,can only give it one, as it does not work at all anymore."
4,Works as described,Even in rough RF environments the phone line extender works. Used as a fax line extender in a multi story building. No complaints. Setup is easy.
5,It really works!,"I needed a phone outlet to hook up a Dish TV DVR box. I tried the one traditional one that uses the outlet wires as the phone line. It took a little work but I got the two units to connect and get a green light on both. However whenever I tried to make a call over the connection either with a phone or the box, the connection got cut. This happened repeatedly. I tried different outlets without anything else on them and still had a problem.I bought the DualJack and hooked it up, it worked immediately with no need to reset or move anything. The diagnostic connection came through as OK immediately. This is a great product that cost the same as the other hook-up without any of the hassle, plus it simply works! What more can you ask for?"
4,Does what it says it will do.,"I purchased this item to provide a convenient phone jack for Dish Network.Who knew 20 years ago you'd need a phone jack right next to your cable outlet. Anyway, it fills that need. The Dish installer wanted $90 for the same item. I decided on this version instead of the others offered on Amazon because of the more favorable rating."
2,bridgeh2o,"If the jack allowed the time and date to pass I'd rate it at five stars. For someonw who just wants an extention phone where there is no phone jack it would probably be fine. Although the jack does allow the name and number to show on the TV screen it does not allow information to pass through to the log. When I try to go back to find the time and date of a call is indicates all calls received Fiday, December 23 at 5:28 pm ragardless of actual time and date received. I tried to resolve the problem but everyone involved points the finger to someone else! I finally gave up! I should have done more research before my purchase."
5,The only one that works,"The reviewer who wrote that this doesn't work with Tivo has no idea what they're talking about. I bought this specifically for my Tivo, and it works fine. In fact, of the wireless jacks I've tried, this is the only one that does work.This unit differs from others in that it uses a 2.4 GHz signal to transmit data or calls, rather than the house's power lines. This seems to work a lot better."
4,Worked as advertised - Careful that the item included is not the older version,"After doing a decent amount of research into this product and the new DECT 6.0 version that was shown on the box picture I ordered the product. However, I received the older 2.4GHz unit. After talking with the company that sold it to me, they confirmed that they only sold the older unit but that I could return it without penalty.However, I chose to open it and try it out and it has worked very nicely. I am actually sending phone service across a driveway to another house next door and the quality has been decent. We have sometimes heard clicks on the line but usually it is fine. There is about a 1/2 second delay in the process but have not heard complaints from the other parties about this in the call from their end. I am considering buying another set for use elsewhere in the house and even buying a third set and just resyncing the receiver to work with the first set I purchased."
2,home user for voice,"bought the product to be able to connect a couple of regular telpehones. changed the switch to the voice mode --- there was lots of line noise, buzzing/cracking in every outlet in the house ---- i tried 17 outlets trying to get a good clear sound --- never did; however, i did get a dial tone at all the outlets."
4,Very Good,Product is all it claims to be. Works well. Stays connectesd and running at about 45 kbps constantly as opposed to about 50 kbps for a solid phone line. Plenty good enough speed. Only reason it's not 5 stars is the 2 units are supposed to be synchronized with each other out of the box but they weren't. Not a big deal since synching takes only a couple of minutes but trobleshooting it to make sure that was the problem took about 15 minutes :-( Other than that it's perfect-so far. The next question will be-how long will it be before it wears out?
1,Failed after 60 days - seller refused to honor warranty,"I had a problem with the one I bought from BuyAccessories after about a month, so I contacted the retailer and manufacturer for warranty support -the device documentation says it comes with a one-year manufacturer warranty.The manufacturer (RTX America) told me product was discontinued and they were no longer honoring the warranty. The retailer refuses to acknowledge my inquiries. I think buyers should be aware this is a liquidation item, no longer being produced, and it comes with no manufacturer's warranty, and absymal seller support."
2,Froman at her best-Recording at it's worst,"The drawback with this ,is the recording quality. It should have been taken right from the soundtrack of the movie and then it would at least be hi-fi. There are better c d's of hers out there."
4,Great Contemporary Brazilian Music,"2 parts electronica, 1 measure of samba and a pinch of pop equals, great comtemporary Brazilian music. Sit back, relax or even dance to some of the most slickest Brazilian tunes. Each track is very different from the next, ranging from modern electronica beats, traditional samba to a remix of an old Brazilian classic. This compiliation gives you an insight as to where Brazil is up to in the contemporary side of things while still keeping that great Brazilian flavour.I wouldn't have discovered this album if I wasn't previously into Brazilian music such as the classic samba and bossa nova. But anyone who only likes the traditional music(which is absolutely fantastic) might not like this. Personally, I think this is really good new stuff from Brazil and I put it alongside all your samba and bossa nova."
1,fake byzance,"Bottle unsealed, box opened. Not Byzance but odd odor, as tho some thing added. Returned to sender for refund."
5,Terrific Book-Very Helpful,"As a teacher of Religion and History at The Episcopal Academy, I think this book is a terrific, age-appropriate guide for youngsters on the Holy Eucharist. The writing is clear, concise, and helpful and the illustrations are wonderful. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for parents, christian education coordinators, priests, and teachers. Two Thumbs up.Peter Carey"
5,My kids really enjoyed this,"My kids really enjoy using this in church, however, I think there should be a Rite I book also. It makes a great gift too for someone who is just learning the ropes of the church and why we do the things we do."
1,Not reliable,This is my third replacement. The unit does not accurately reflect the indoor temp. Air ran all night. Temp in apt was 60 but the thermostat read 84.No help at all from Honeywell. Told me to call Paul Arntzen in customer service. After ten calls all of which went to voice mail I never heard back.Bought a different brand and it works great.Avoid this product.
5,Thermostat,The best themostat that I have ever bought and installed. Has a dead-band of +/- 1 degree. Simple and easy to set.
4,Very Nice - BUT there is a better book...,"Just was able to glance through my copy of Daybreak 2000. I must admit this is a truely great book with great photos. I only gave it 4 stars because there is another book out called ""Dawn of the 21st Century"" which has an extremely diversity of photos also taken as we entered the new Millennium. It has over 500 photos from 116 countries. It may be a little more money, but it is also a ""Limited Edition"" and I had added it to my library. Daybreak 2000 is a great book to have, but I'll pick ""Dawn of the 21st Century"" above it."
2,Disappointment with Daybreak 2000,"Although the photos are excellent in Daybreak 2000,there is a static quality to the book, as there is with most landscape photography. Landscapes have been around for thousands of years and aren't likely to change at the new millennium. On the other hand, I agree with reviewer Tom Donadio,that Dawn of the 21st Century is a much better photographic essay of the new millennium. It shows people celebrating the new millennium as well as gorgeous once in a lifetime fireworks pictures. There is a broader range of pictures also, and comprises over 500 pictures from over 300 photographers, both pro and amateur. For my money, it's Dawn over Daybreak."
3,Counter-Steer? GP3 vs Tourist Trophy?,"Pleae, someone tell me are these motorcycle simulations realistic in that you have to counter-steer like real riding? I couldn't use an arcade m.c. game because you steered it like a car.Which is better - GP3 or Tourist Trophy? (for PS2)I had to enter a fun rating number to be able to post this, although I've never seen these games/simiulations."
5,READ THE MANUAL!,You can make sure you are ordering the correct set of flavorizer bars by looking in the manual or by going online to the Weber home page - they have a replacement parts lookup section.A great Weber feature is that all parts can easily be replaced as they are modular and stocked almost by everyone that sells Weber BBQ's. Some parts are meant to be replaced every so often and the flavorizer bars are one of those items that you will have to spend 30-60 bucks on every several years. Thats just fine with me - be happy that you can make your $500-$700 investment just like new by doing so.
4,Book Plus Cassette tape is appropriate for preschoolers,"I purchased this book & cassette set several months ago. I played the tape whenever my children and I were traveling around town. Within a week or two, my 4 year old had pretty good mastery of her letter sounds. My 2 year old could answer correctly about half the time. Some of the songs are contrived and could be more cleverly done, but it certainly works for preschoolers who are not very critical by nature. The book is little more than a colloring book with the jingles printed on the page.If you have to play kid tapes while your in the car, this is a good choice. Kids learn without trying."
3,A light enjoyable read,This love story was between two self-centered people who didn't truly know how to love so spent a lot of time being dishonest to each other and themselves. I enjoyed reading it but found it frustrating as well. I read it as if I were a fly on the wall watching it rather than feeling that I could identify with the characters. They seemed shallow and heartless. It was a quick read and it kept my attention but the plot just wasn't developed deeply.
1,Slow-going and Dull,"I suspect you might have to be an Oregonian to like this book, and a patient one at that. (I read it as the choice of another member of my book group.) Although I'm a voracious reader, I found ""Finches,"" like many ersatz 20th-century ""Victorian"" novels, way too long--and I was able to foresee at least one crucial development of the plot long before it was revealed. The author at times has a rather clipped style and uses words in what at best might be considered an unusual or ""fresh"" way, but I often had to reread her sentences to figure out their meaning. The two lead characters especially were unappealing and the ostentatious description of their ostentatious wealth was boring. Unless you live in Oregon and are a committed devotee of its history, don't waste your time on this one. I would have given this book no star at all if I had been given that choice."
1,agree with slow and dull,"I am an Oregonian and found this to be painful to read. My book group selected it, otherwise I would have stopped at 100 pages. I am writing this, my first review, to provide some balance to the glowing reports given this poorly written so called historical novel. I finally gave up on page 289 unwilling to waste any more time on undeveloped characters, sentences without subjects, and more questions raised than answered.Horrible. My rating - 5 stars."
5,Thank God for Barry Stone,"I bought this book to help through the process of buying a home that I had inspected already but felt as if the inspection wasn't accurate. The inspector found barely anything wrong with the 50 year old home I was buying. I was concerend, especially considering the inspector was a personal friend of my real estate agent. I chose this book over others due to Barry's national status as a columnist and after reading it, I hired my own inspector based upon Barry's insights. What I learned about the home in terms of what had not been disclosed to me was enough to consider action against both my agent and home inspector. Above all else, the old furnace was emitting hazardous fumes into the home. Thank God for Barry and this book."
1,Not worth reading,Not a good book to read. There are other books that provide useful information but this book had very little good ideas to use. The price is very but that still just justify spending the time to read it due to the lack of help I got from this book. Get something else and don't waste your money.
1,Not for everyone,"As a Spiritual Atheist, I agreed with Mr. Orr's opinion that religion is what has taught human beings that they must age and die (without the fear of death and eternal torment, what is the need for salvation?) and his observation that churches are full of people who are praying but are still getting sick and dying, but that is as much as I enjoyed about this book. Mr. Orr has taken Christianity and removed the things he doesn't like about it and compounded upon the things he does like, and this is his synopsis. Since I believe Christianity is another religious myth like the many others that have come before it, I found his insistence that one must invoke the Christian God's name daily as part of one path to immortality as silly and a bit hypocritical. If you are a Christian with an open mind, then you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, I don't recommend it to anyone."
1,Stop calling it science,"I'm familiar with the book, and even some of the author's co-horts, peers, and students writing's as well.The biggest problem I have is the mis use of the word science in this case, because nothing about this book is science. It is spirituality, philosophy, and self help, but it is not science. Science has standards, and this man's teachings do not adhere to them."
3,The last thing we need...,"Buddy Ebsen (April 2, 1908 - July 7, 2003)Art Carney passed away on November 9th, 2003 at the age of 85Milton Berle, dead at 93 - March 28, 2002Charles Bronson dies at 81 - Sep. 1, 2003Gregory Peck dies at 87 - Jun. 13, 2003Oscar Winner Anthony Quinn Dies - Jun 03, 2001Do I detect sarcasm in an other review? I don't know if this was discussed in the book (I'm just providing a level-headed opinion on the concept) but if you are going to kick the ""death urge"" get rid of the urge to procreate first. I mean this in the most humane sence possible, not as an insult. The last thing we need is people who live forever and continue to populate an world already nearing capacity.I'll check it out sometime, mostly as an exercise to expand my knowledge."
3,small but nice,"I think this is a good product for the price, but really small. my 3 year old loves them though. i guess that's what really counts."
1,Poorly made,"In less than a week after I bought these garden tools for my 7 and 3-year old grandkids, the shovel and rake broke apart. I would not recommend these tools."
5,tool set,I bought this for my grandson for his birthday. It is a very sturdy set. He pushes them around in his wheelbarrow and helps his dad in the yard.
2,??,well this are cute but i did think to read that they are metal so he cant play with this these yet. he might hurt his self or someone esle.
1,One tool missing,"They seemed like good quality tools for a great price, but mine arrived with one of the tools missing from the box. I had to return it. There was no way to simply have the missing tool shipped to me."
4,Short-Sighted Manufacturer!,"Great tools, BUT the wooden handles are untreated, which means that the raw wood will get dirty and be almost impossible to clean. So I bought the set for my niece and sprayed the handles with two coats of exterior varnish, including the little screws that hold the metal to the wood. Hopefully that will help deter future rust on those parts. These are sturdy, heavy-duty tools that will last a long time. I just can't imagine why the manufacturer would be so short-sighted about protecting the wooden handles from becoming permanently dirty! Definitely a good buy, if you're willing to take the finishing steps."
5,Awesome!,"My 4 year old daughter loves these. I just got them and have used them once but the quality is great. They are REAL tools, not cheap plastic."
5,Good quality.,"These items are very well constructed. I've found with plastic sandbox toys that the handles always break. These, on the other hand, will be outgrown rather than worn out."
4,Good size but metal is thin,These tools are the perfect size for little hands to use in a sandbox or garden bed. Packaged nicely (if purchasing for a gift). Handles are shaped well. Only complaint is that the metal is thinner than I would have liked; not sure these will hold up for years of wear and tear.
4,Gardening tools for toddler,"I bought these tools for my 2 year old daughter. Although we haven't had them long enough to know the durability, they seem quite sturdy. The size is perfect for my daughter who loves to help and play in the garden. I wish the handle for the rake is slightly longer. In terms of price, today I saw the same set being sold at Target (under the store brand and in different colors) for a cheaper price."
4,Better than plastic.,I bought this tool set for our grandson. He likes to help andI would rather he use these tools than his bare hands. I like the material that they are made of and how the are assembled.
