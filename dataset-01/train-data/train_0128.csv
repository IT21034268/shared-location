1,Awful. See Tribe,"What does Queensryche sound like with a new mediocre guitarist? I remember listening to this album repeatedly to see if I liked it, then listened again months later. I still can't stand it. The lyrics don't really strike any chords and the music is nothing _but_ chords. It's bargain bin fodder.All of their albums up until Empire were great. Empire had some good songs. I even like ""Promised Land"" and ""Hear in the Now"" after that. Q2K and Tribe test my patience."
2,"Without DeGarmo, No Direction","Without Chris DeGarmo, QR became an ordinary hard rock band. Actually, *extremely* ordinary. I really can't even get through this album. DeGarmo seemed to be the guiding force behind QR's best work and without him, there seems to be no direction - nothing holding the songs together and nothing feeling very passionate. The music is played well & Tate sounds find, but this does not stand up to their best work (_Promised Land_, _Empire_, & _Mindcrime_). Listening to this album will only make you want to shut it off, grab one of their classics, and remind yourself why you liked them so much in the first place."
1,Q2K try why you say!,"OH MY GOD WHAT IN THE H#LL WERE THEY SMOKING ?THIS ISNT EVEN FUNNY BECAUSE THESE GUYS HAVE TALENT I KNOW WE HAVNT HEARD.BUY THE WAY WHO EVER WROTE THIS IS THE BEST HAS NEVER BEEN "" ON THE ROAD TO MADNES!""ORSEEN""SUITE SISTER MARY""I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU AND ALL THE GREAT MUSIC YOU MISSED.I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER MINDCRIME OR BETTER BOY I COULDNT HAVE BEEN MORE SHOCKED"
2,Tate's voice is shot,I think it is clear that all the screaming and Touring has caused permenant damage to Tates voice--that is the reason for the change in their music. It is really a shame and is not the bands fault the tunes just dont sound the same without his high energy vocals.I would bet anything that when we hear Chris' new band--the vocalist with have restored Tate-type voice.I will say that I saw QR last year live and even though they had to tip-toe around the high notes and screams of old--they can put on an awesume show
3,Not Their Best But Solid.,"It isn't the best but it's still enjoyable. It isn't as good as their earlier recordings but I'm not trying to compare it since it's a lot different. Rage for Order, Operation: Mindcrime, Empire and The Warning are their best and Q2K isn't their best effort but it's still underrated and doesn't deserve the hate it gets. Falling Down is great and one of their best songs, beats anything from Hear In The Now Frontier 10 times over. That album wasn't bad but it was very simple and generic, too experimental. Q2K is heavier and in a more industrial direction, follows their roots more and picks up from the average HITNF."
4,"DIFFERENT, BUT STILL GOOD","I think some of the people who reviewed this cd, need to get their head out of the past. I mean really, does anyone expect Queensryche to do another Operation: Mindcrime! Of course not. Let's face it, this cd is good. Not great, but good. It is clearly better than their last cd. One Life, Burning Man, Right Side Of My Mind & Sacred Ground are all very good. The only thing this cd lacks is versatility. Promised Land just oozes versatility, which is why that is their greatest cd to date. I would rank Q2K above Hear In The Now Frontier or Warning. Like I said earlier, you can't expect them to repeat the past, and while it may not be an all-time great, how bands can still make a cd this good after 15+ years!"
2,Anybody listening?,"This is a very uninspiring album. Only a couple tunes are catchy, none are edgy. I wish they could sing a different type of background vocal, and I'm tired of the waahh-waahh guitar sound in the background, present both on this album and Hear in the Now Frontier. I used to LOVE these guys, and have been a fan since the EP and The Warning came out and I blasted them in my dorm room while studying. I think nearly all of us agree that Promised Land was the creative end of the band, they're just putting out stuff now for the sake of supporting them and their families. It's okay, we'll always have Mindcrime, which has enough genius in it than most band's entire discography."
4,Good to go!,"I really like the new Q2K probably for some of the same reasons some dislike it. It's a fresh different sound. Most of the negative reviews I have read note the differences it has to Operation Mindcrime or other albums. I have judged it based on just the album itself and it drives pretty well. It isn't an earth shattering, ground breaking, world mover nor do I think it should be. I think that Queensryche has put out a solid musical score that has staying power. Although musically different, I liken it to Rage For Order's strategy. That album, although I really like it, didn't, in my opinion, have as much 'substance' as The Warning or Queensryche but it was a definite new sound that would help fuel them in the eighties and I think Q2K has some of the same characteristics. I've been told that they are coming out with another album in 6 months and can't wait to see what develops since it is always exciting to watch this band grow."
3,QR is missing Chris Degarmo,"This is not a ""classis"" QR album. BREAKDOWN ROOM and LIQUID SKY are excellent, While WOT KINDA MAN and WHEN THE RAIN COMES are downright insipid. I can see Chris Degarmo was the brain behind the lyrics in the band- they don't have that ""thinking man's metal band"" intelligence on this album. I rate it in the middle of the pack-- they could have done better, but then again, it's better than most of the other stuff out there! There is more on this one than on HITNF, but less than EMPIRE OR PROMISED LAND."
3,Degarmo's presence sorely missed!,"Go back and listen to ""Empire"" after hearing this, and you'll change your mind about thinking it's very good. Like McDonald's, it's satisfying in the short run, but quickly forgotten. The sound is there, and Geoff Tate sounds great as always, but what's missing is the strong, unique songwriting style that Chris Degarmo brought to the group. There's a hundred bands out there that could have written these riffs. It's albums like this that make me go for stuff like the new Filter CD."
1,Queensryche's Downward Spiral,"After the refreshing ""Hear in the Now Frontier,"" Queensryche has returned with an unfortunate change of style. After years of playing prog metal, it is odd that they waited until 1999 to begin picking up elements of industrial and grunge, even if they are from Seattle. The result is a forgettable set of songs and a major misstep. There are no highlights here to mention and die hard fans only need buy this one."
1,Poetry? Nope. Marvelous playing? Nope. Great vocals? Nope.,"Everything I loved from Queensryche...their playing, Tate's vocals, and amazing songwriting...HiTNF and this simply mock. None of those great highs and lows where Geoff Tate seems to duel w/ Ian Gillian, none of the gut-wrenching poetry I've come to love. Empire was worth the money just for ""Empire"" and ""Anybody Listenning?"", Rage for Order, however dated, still shows great poetry, and their other albums are in the middle somewhere, though all worth buying. However, they've now released two that are nothing but crap. No poetry being belted out by Tate's amazing throat, and none of that great songwriting...the whole album is predictable, and the only good track is ""On the Right Side of My Mind"". Hopefully, this poor album is simply related to the new label I see..."
1,Grunge,"This is regressive rock with lyrics that sound like a forced attempt to imitate Promised Land. The expected Queensryche emotion, energy, insanity, and creativity have faded to a rather boring mess."
1,Yet another step towards obscurity,"Queensryche used to be a band that mattered and made thought provoking, intense music with awesome guitar work and even more amazing singing by Geoff. If that is what got you hooked on Queensryche, DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS CD!!!!!This is not the Queensryche of old, but hey if you are into shallow, grungy music with no integrity or meaning, by all means pick this up!"
1,DONT EVER blame Indonesia!!!,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...after i read the Editorial Reviews, i cant stop to laugh,,WHY Indonesia?? Editor looks like want to destroy Indonesia with their movie...if its about persecution between Muslim and Christian, that editor think about what happen in Palestine?? what the HELL happen in Iraq??just thing about that!NOT all Muslim people is good people, BUT NOT all Christians is good people too,,And dont blame Indonesia bcos Indonesia is the MOST muslim population,,with Peace,Dani Sinaga,,my father Christians, and my Mother Muslim,and i proud to be Muslim,,(im sorry for my bad English, warm regards from Indonesia)"
5,This CD is a must have for Traditional Country lovers!!!,"This is definetly one of Lee Ann's best Albums. NOT A BAD SONG ANYWHERE ON THIS CD!! If you like good Tradition country music you'll love this CD!! This CD also produced the top ten hits ""The Fool"" and ""You've Got To Talk To Me"". Other great songs on this album are ""Buckaroo"", ""Trouble's Here"", and ""Never Again, Again"", or at least those are my favorites!!This CD is a must have for any country music lover's collection!!"
5,lee ann womack,"this is the best womack cd i hear.i love all of the cd. i was wordless from hearing the first sang,she is the best."
3,A good place to start,"Greenhalgh's book is a good place to start if you want to learn how to consume research articles. The target audience for this book is those primarily interested in health research, but it useful for all those who must make their way through journal articles. Greenhalgh goes through the basics and touches on important issues. However, it is important to point out that this book is only a first step in understanding how to read journal articles."
4,Good guide to EBM,"Greenhalgh's book is a great read for someone familiar with medical and research terminology. As a med student, I loved it and found it very practical. It contains a great deal of material on how to evaluate the type, methodology, and statistical methods of research papers. There is no glossary, and in places the layout is hard to look at."
2,too much for so little,"For the cost of this book plus shipping, I didn't feel I got value. Also, some of his instruction for the particulars of tango is very different than instruction I've received from many teachers from Bueno Aires where Argentine Tango originated."
3,Good solid Grape blues with jazzy overtones,"Despite the title ""Live Grape"" is only partly live--about half sound like they were recorded without an audience, like at soundcheck. Good playing throughout, but it doesn't have that essential Moby Grape ""wild electron energy"" that the first 3 lp's did--until Skip Spence shows up and sings ""Must Be Goin' Now, Dear"". Then the 3 guitar energy powers up again, revealing for once and for all that Spence really wanted to be the Grape's lead guitarist, but Jerry Miller already had that spot nailed down before Spence joined. The result? Lots of competing lead guitar fills and a lot of charisma. Too bad this was to be his last recorded appearence with the band. As for the rest of the tunes, they are solid musically, and Jerry Miller is his usual great ""have guitar, can play anything"" self, but this CD is for current fans, rather than for people new to the band."
3,Perhaps a little ahead of its time.,"This is pure pop at its best. Cathy Dennis moves away from the dance beats of her previous efforts with this sublime fusion of 60's and 90's pop. It's just that it may have been released too early, 1995. It would have been more perfectly timed with the Bacharach renaissance of the late 90's and the Austin Powers era.Dennis' voice is perfectly suited here. While it sounded rather thin against the over-the-top production of her dancier days it melds perfectly with the production here.There are a few misses but the album is extremely catchy and is a perfect windows down/top down driving album. Enjoy!"
5,The best album ever!!,"I bought this album on sale in a British record store, remembering I wanted a few years earlier mainly because I liked the singles (West End Pad, Waterloo Sunset and When Dreams Turn to Dust). I knew I would like it but I had no idea it would become my favourite CD. Am I The Kinda of Girl is immensly satisfying and every song is a classic. The album consist of Guitar pop tunes that grow on you so much you find yourself listening to this at every available oppertunity, and why shouldn't you. Brilliance!!!"
4,Grreeeaaattt,This product was great once I bought it. It just didn't quite fit my needs. But I would reccomend this product to anyone. It backs up the SONY name!
4,"The drive is great, the bundled software could be improved.","This drive has performed great since it was purchased. I have not had to waste a disc on a bad burn yet. I get consistent burn rates (approximately 40X), along with read (40X-48X) and re-writes (12X). The drive is relatively quiet compared to other ATAPI CD-RWs with simlar statistics.All in all, the CRX195A is a good buy, and can generally be found for a good price."
3,"Sounded wonderful, but","I have enjoyed all of her previous books and I hoped this might be her best effort yet. However, I think she is too focused on Santa Fe and the southwest feel. There was way more of it in this book than I wanted to see. Where were the beach houses, the lake cabins, the mountain hideaways? I was disappointed overall and wish she had been less regional in her subjects."
2,Mary Emmerling's Romantic Country,Typical for Mary Emmerling's books.....short & sweet. A Little disappointing but always nice to open it now & again.
5,Mary Emmerling's Romantic Country,I loved this book. Mary Emmerling's style is like no other. If you like southwest romantic style then you will find a number of great ideas to translate into your home. I keep it by the bedside table and find something new every time I pick it up.
1,Unreasonable,"It is unreasonable that a $4.01 book have a delivery charge of $23.98 added to the order without prior warning. Even more unreasonable is the statement: 'This portion of your order is being prepared for shipment and cannot be canceled or changed.' This statement appeared immediately after the order was placed, making it impossible to cancel this order. The order was placed on Boxing Day and clearly nobody was 'preparing' the order for shipment within less than five minutes of the order being placed!"
5,"Big Rick, D.J. at ,KICA FM 98.3 ROCKS! Clovis N.M.","I first heard this album in'90.I recomend you listen to this cd a couple of times before forming an oppinion.These guys are tight.Andy prieboy picks up nicely where Stan Ridgeway left off.WVD's rendition of Johnny Cash's ""Ring of fire"" is to what Johnny's rendition of Trent Reznor's ""Hurt""is.My favorites on this disk are ""Wrong way to Hollywood"",""Blackboard sky"" & ""Living in the red"" and thats not to take anything away from any of the rest of the disk.I just feel these are the most hipnotic trax.For a live album I rate it ""e"",for exellent.A great mix of moog & tradition...Like a rootbeer float,they go great together,well in this case anyway."
1,So much for that,"I ordered this product through GizmosForLife in the Amazon marketplace several months ago. They sent me an order confirmation and then proceeded to cancel my order. I emailed them and, to this day, have received no response. Stay away from GizmosForLife!"
2,Very poor,I bought this book at the beginning of Sept 2003. Normally I read such a book within 3 week. Now it's december 2003 and I am still reading. Having 100 pages left slowly some tension develops and it becomes more interesting. The fact that this book has nothing else worthful p.ex. irony it's very boring to read. I hope I will sonn finish. My advice: Don't buy it!
3,Read the others first...,"I looked forward to this book after reading his other two, but it just didn't keep me interested. It started to get better after the 1/2 way point, but until then, the jumping around to set the situation didn't allow for the smooth flow of the story."
2,This Book has it All,"This book has it all -- international intrigue, a killer cadre, a duplicitous lover and a former fighter jet jock now CEO of his own brokerage firm. Only a taste of reality is missing."
5,Great International Intrigue,"As a nice touch on the side, the author's German name ""Reich"" means ""Rich"" in English and it is very appropriate for the title of this book ""The First Billion."" Reich's book is an excellent novel with a great cast of characters in a fictitious world of corporate intrigue and the big game of Wall Street. Not only is it an interesting read, but it's an adventure. I would also recommend another powerful suspense thriller which I greatly enjoyed and is along the same lines to some degree, which is Alec Donzi's THE CONSULTANT."
4,Third Reich novel,"But not a novel of the Third Reich! Sorry, couldn't help it. I really enjoyed this one. The author is very adept at narrating financial intrigue. He employs very smart prose in general, but is a master at this stuff in particular."
3,Rather formulaic,"I chose this book simply by spotting the spine while at the library. But once I got into it, it just seemed rather formulaic. Flashbacks occurred at predictable interviews. The major characters, at different times, all seemed to stop and look at themselves in the mirror. There just wasn't anything all that intriguing."
3,Arduously slow start.....but then all of a sudden...,"This is the first book I have read by this author and admittedly I came close to putting it down, but don't. It's attention to finance detail nearly bored me to tears and made for a tough start in the begininning of the story. It's worth pushing through, although the author is giving you a bit of a finance lesson, he's setting you up for the rest of the story, though that seems unclear at first. But he finally weaves it together and the story takes off like one of the characters jets. A bit formula, Russia bad, America good theme, and I agree with another reviewer that this could easily be a movie, it reads like one.It does have some good surprises, there are no wimpy women and the authors knowledge of Switzerland and some of their customs adds a realistic touch to a fun to this entertaining but rather convoluted story. I would rate this as a great airport or vacation read. A light and easy read."
4,A welcome upgrade to Operation Flashpoint,"The Good : Beautiful scenery and graphics, huge map, Join In Play, TrackIR support. User mod support.The Bad : The AI is still pretty dumb - but can see through bushes and fires with laser precision in some cases. Some annoying bugs are present. They reworked the helicopter flight model so it takes some getting used to.The Verdict : This is a very worthy successor to Operation Flashpoint. It does require a better video card to really see the visuals in action, but it's worth it. The problems can be fixed through mods or patches, so none are really show stopper bad."
3,Exactly like Operation Flashpoint,"If you loved Operation Flashpoint, then this is the exact same game with extremely minor graphics upgrades. I was mildly entertained. The soldiers run like rag dolls and the vehicles are not truly simulated. This game is too much arcade and too little sim."
1,Don't Buy this game,"This game is bugged out, I downloaded the patch which didn't really help.My computer is maxed out and up to date and still the graphics in this game were sub-par.Theres alot more better First person shooter games to get."
2,Armed bust,"While the graphics are more up-to-date, the overall game play, storyline, and ease of consumer editing of game specifics is far less than OFP (Operation Flashpoint.)No editing tools were provided by BIS before or during the release of ARMA. As of this review, the community awaits some form a editing tool.The only useful upgrade of ARMA is the ability to switch between characters, outside of this, OFP is far superior, even though it is a much older program.In summary, do not purchase ARMA. It is a waste of $ until a wide range of multiple issues are addressed, and the modding community is up-to-speed, creating their addons to make the program worth playing. By the time this takes place OFP2 by Codemasters should be released, which promises to be backwards compatable with OFP, making ARMA moot.Save your $$$!!"
2,very painful ...buggy and boring,"it just takes too long to play a game with big maps .....you have to be online all day to get good at it....not like battlefield 2 , learning curve is killing me....you can't train in a jet in training mode ...when you get online you have to capture areas for you to get good weapons thats what i hate about the game, if spending all day on a game is enjoyable buy it."
5,The BIG DOG levels the field again!,"Others have tried, but there's only one game series that delivers the level of realism, freedom and vast terrain needed for combined military operations. The OFP/ArmA series has only disappointed the weak and immature. It has elevated the standards all other military simulations should follow. Bohemia Interactive has once again blown my helmet off. Take it from me, save your money and stop buying games that leave you feeling cheated. This is the ONLY combat game you'll need for a LONG time.7-year OFP Pilot/Tactician"
2,It figures......................,"I should have known that anything with Atari,looks like Atari. Graphics looked like a typical arcade game,just terrible. And the story line,terrible. You get what you pay for. I guess when you play the best like Call of Duty series,you get spoiled. But,I am sorry it was just terrrible. Graphics,loop type music bad.........."
3,Misleading title....,"The title of this book is very misleading. The recipes do incorporate some whole grains in each recipe, but use predominantly unbleached white flour.There are a few recipes that are entirely whole-grain, but if that is your focus, you would do better to keep looking.I'm sure there are some fine recipes in this book (I own several of Ken Haedrich's books), just not what I was expecting."
3,Paradise,It is nice to have all the episodes but the picture quaility is lacking.This series is excellent as far as the story lines but the old films need to be digitally enhanced.
4,Adventures in Paradise DVD set,"Although 2-3 of the episodes were unwatchable, the majority were in good shape and were a joy to watch. We saw one a night for quite a while and thoroughly enjoyed reliving our youth when we had first seen the series.The Tiki is a neat boat and the areas of the South Pacific were beautiful back in the fifties. Gardner McKay was a hunk!"
1,Re Master PLEASE!,"The quality of the transfers on these discs is just appalling. Somewhere, someone has the original b/w films. Please do us all a favour and re-master them, instead of peddling these third rate quality transfers on amazon customers. I, too, would pay good money to see this fabulous series given the treatment it deserves.After all, it's the reason I jumped on a ship out of Australia and became a captain in the Merchant Marine.Amazon should not even be selling such poor quality merchandise."
3,adventures in paradise,"I was happy to recieve these cds of adventures in paradise. It takes me back a ways but unfortunatly some of the episodes are not easy to watch as they flutter and the sound is bad. But over all, it's fine. thankyou"
2,Adventures in Paradise TV series,The general production of this product is poor - particularly the vision and sound quality. Some DVDs have background noises that overpower the audio of the episodes.While some loss of vision quality is expected in old movies etc - the poor vision & sound detracts from enjoying many of the episodes.Better production is essential.
5,Adventures in Paradise,As this was the first time I have purchased anything on line I wasn't sure what to expect. Thank you for getting my order out to me so quickly and efficiently its been great especially as I'm laid up with a broken leg.cheers alana
5,Glen Johnson is probably a genius.,"This `99 release sounds like some lost `80's masterpiece of dark atmospherics and sweetly gloomy pop. Wonderful and eerie, experimental and dreamy, trance and organic psychedelia in a mix of male and female vocals. Bringing to mind: Deux Filles, Strawberry Switchblade, Durutti Column, Anna Domino and such contemporary outfits as; Hood, Jessamine, Current 93, Tindersticks, and Lambchop's darkest musings. Piano, not so much, Magic, much indeed. Twilight drawing room's shifting ambience and slowly emerging details, keep this sound/song tapestry consistently captivating."
2,Gloom grooves,"2 1/2These morose minimalist melodies can at best emit hazily haunted intrigue, though more often lets the ambient repetition wear thin."
4,"Still wondering why ""Gimme an Inch Girl"" wasn't a bigger hit","This is the best way to go if you're a singles collector. Other CD's with ""Shake It"" are much inferior in sound quality and none but the ""Stealiin' Home"" album feature ""Gimme an Inch Girl"" which was a minor follow-up hit to ""Shake It"" in 1979."
3,Martha Reeves/ Dancing in the Street,"This release from K-Tel features ten tracks by Martha Reeves, five of which are re-recordings of her hits with the Vandellas. Four others are her cover versions of hits by other Motown artists. The disc closes with her rendition of Aretha Franklin's song ""I Say A Little Prayer."" Needless to say, the re-recordings, however good they may sound, do not quite measure up to the original versions. There's a slight vibrato in her voice that comes with age, and it's noticeable in her performance. This is likely how Martha would sound today if you saw her in concert."
5,"Absolutely gorgeous, classy, melodic, and masterful!","This flawless 'album' is hauntingly beautiful, and for me, the absolute BEST work Difford has done to date by far. Chris' voice is soulful, heartfelt, and soothing, and the songwriting brilliant and tight. The musicianship and backround vocals are superb too, and the songs and lyrics infectious. My wife and I have thousands of CD's in our collection, and i've got to say, this release is one of our all time 'top 20' if we had to pick. If you could combine the best elements of alternative, jazz, blues, and classic crooner music, this would be the final result. Production-wise, the sonics and mastering is audiophile quality, with lots of 'air' and depth to the recording. Like a famous actor on SNL once said... ""LIKE BUTTAH""!!!"
3,difford mellows solo,"I've been a huge fan of Squeeze for 15+ years and I own just about everything they've recorded. Thus, I feel like I know them pretty well (musically, at least). That said, this disc threw me for a little loop. The music is sparse and almost jazzy. This is far removed from the bouncy Britpop of Squeeze's 'Frank' and'Cool For Cats'. Instead, it is more reminiscent of mellower discs like 'Sweets From A Stranger' and 'Play'. While ex-bandmate Glenn Tilbrook infused joy into his excellent solo CD 'The Incomplete Glenn Tilbrook', Difford's disc seems to lack that energy. Still, the songs here are well-crafted and his singing sounds better than on most Squeeze discs. Despite the fizzle out on VH1's 'Bands Reunited', I'm still hoping Squeeze regroups. If not, though, in the battle of the bands...Glenn wins a convincing KO over Chris."
3,Not so Cool for Cats,"I went to what was one of the last concerts performed by Squeeze before they officially broke up. By the expression on Glenn Tilbrooks face, he did not seem to care about Chris. Infact he announced to the audience, ""I know, I know, where the f*** is Chris?"" Everyone in the audience chimed in with him. Difford and tillbrook were the Lennon and McCartney of the 1980's, but somewhere along the line, their friendship turned sour. There were rumors about Chris and alcohol abuse, but no one knows what really happened. This album might not be Diffords best work, but it is a decent start. It might not have the power that Glenn Tilbrook posseses but I think that Chris Difford will do fine as a solo artist. However if you are expecting Squeeze, then buy their greatest hits."
4,Great product. Loves it.,At first I was using clay based rabbit litter. It took me about twenty-five minutes to scoop her litter every night with the clay litter and it was so messy. Then I read about Yesterday's News rabbit litter. I will never use another litter again. This stuff works great and it cuts my litter scooping time in half.
5,Awesome Litter,"I just bought Yesterday's news because it was on sale. OMGosh! I'lll never go back. It is awesome! We have 2 rabbits inside, and with this litter there is NO smell! Totally recommend :)"
4,You're Not In Kansas Anymore,"Mirolla's writing takes you into the dark and terrifying world of truth. It may come at you obliquely, but it will eventually get you right between the eyes - maybe even in that third eye winking knowingly. The power of his imagination is a thing to behold - like being the first one to arrive at an accident scene - broken glass reflecting prisms of time that expand and collapse following the fractured rules of some unknown cosmic physics flowing in language and blood."
4,A good book for those who want to study all market aspects,"The book with information about every element of market, but there is not too much information about specific of trading. It is a common instrument for learning of trading. You must read it if you look for a complex knowlege about exchanges and markets at all."
2,"3 to 4 pages to everything in trading, really everything","There are 33 chapters in this 639 page book which practically put everything you can think of about trading or investment into it. Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, Trading Psychology, Options, Commodities... simply everything. The problem is: dont know whether it's the intent of the author to give so general an idea of everything to its readers or he is too agressive to encompass so much in one single book. He just used a page or two to describe very complicated items like MACD, Stochastics, Gann Fan, Fibonnaci numbers, Bonds, Computer Trading, Crude Oil, Platinum, Gamma, Theta, Rho, Delta Neutral Trading........In case you just want to have a close to nothing idea of the highly complicated trading or investment market, it's for you. In case you read in order to earn an edge to profit in market where 90% to 95% of the participants are doomed to fail, forget about this."
2,Probably best to skip,"Alan Singer's novel focuses on what it means to have a body and what it means to have a consciousness and what it means to have a memory at a very involved philosophical level. These ideas are more dramatized than explained, which makes it a little hard to understand. Plus, he filters all these dramatized theories through his own complex theories about prose and fiction, which focus on rhetorical complexity in lieu of plot complexity and things of this nature.If you're absolutely blown away by the concept that people think, that people really, actually cogitate despite the fact that their consciousnesses are located in bodies, then you may just love this work. If not, that is, you believe in an eternal soul and/or otherwise think that the mind and body are not the same thing (or if you don't care one way or the other)you may want to take a pass because this work's philosophical underpinnings may not resonate much with you."
4,he was the best,"i have all of his music, wore out the original cassettes and finally got allthe cd's. Love his music, the lyrics are so heartfelt. Too bad he didn't get the recognition he deserved in the music world."
2,Item description is plain wrong. All Man Made Materials,"These shoes are nice looking and reasonably comfortable, but they do not have any leather. It is very disappointing. They are also true to size (I always wear a 9 in Franco Sarto and these aren't any different).I found out what was going on with the item description. The black color is leather, whereas the blue (the one I ordered) is all man made. I called Zappos to complain about their description and they updated it already, so check there to see which colors are man made vs. leather."
1,All man made?,"Terrible...this shoes are like stones,it doesn't have a piece of leather. Franco Sarto...no thanks. I wasted my money and I felt angry-sad..."
5,Rockin' Platforms,"The T. Moro is a fabulous color--very dark brown, textured. The toe is more round than almond shaped which actually makes it even more comfortable. Great silhouette!"
2,Beautiful but problematic,"I am always on the lookout for navy blue shoes and when I saw them knew I had to have them. When I opened them I was delighted, they were beautiful. Having the platform helped them seem not so high and I could actually walk in them and my 59 year old legs looked shapely and young. Sadly, after wearing them for 10 minutes discovered my heel kept popping up. I wasn't sure it was from my toes sliding forward or the fit of the shoe. They were comfortable and surprisingly easy to walk in despite the height of the heel. I may order them in a size smaller because they are such a pretty shoe!"
3,Three & a Half Stars,"No review yet? Okay, well then, just on first listen (last night) I'll say it's below the first 4-5 albums in all the things that made Stackridge music interesting and enjoyable, but still these three members know how to resurrect a sound. The first track is one of the best ever S. tunes."
5,Love Blax,Never pulls your hair and stays put. I've reused the same one a few times and they keep their shape for the most part. I've purchased similar hair bands but didn't like them as much as Blax. Hard to find but great price on Amazon.
4,Always sounds good....,"Hey I like Pete. He always sounds good. Plays the clarinet like no other. Have seen him many times at Casino Majic and Hollywood casino in Bay St. Louis. I am more a ""rock"" fan and bought this CD to have Pete in my collection. Seems to work for me, good compilation."
5,the best of pete fountain,I am a clarinet player of the past and a fan of Pete Fountain.The richness of his sound is captured on this CD and the selection of numbers is well chosen.There are so many artists here besides Pete Fountain and they are regrettably not mentioned.I listen to this CD while on the Nordic Track and never has thirty minutes gone so fast.
4,One of our favorites,This is a general overview of many nature subjects. Best for younger kids or to use as a jumping off point for further study. Excellent illustrations. Has many hidden pictures throughout which my kids loved.We usually use this in kindergarten. All the kids really enjoyed it and spent many hours looking through it.
4,great book for the kids,We got this to go with a a gift that outdoor hunting items. It is a through and informative book yet still engaging for kids. Highly recommend it!
3,Great book! But never again from this seller.,"This is by far the best first science book for children. The content, pictures, and reading level are perfect for grades K-2. However, my disgust with this order is the smell of cigarette smoke in the book itself, which is so strong I can't stand to look at this book with my child. Will definitely be ordering it again from another seller, and hopefully we will get a good copy that we can enjoy without holding our breath. This copy is not fit for use with children."
5,Very Very Large Can of Whup Ass,"While little Jimmy Osterberg and Wayne Kramer were cutting gym class to sniff glue, these five young dudes were churning out ageless kick-ass punk rock crazy style! Simple instructions: calm yourself, play ""Strychnine"" very loud, and lose your mind on the punk rock that puts 90s teenie would-be punk to shame! This will be the best punk rock album you will ever buy, and it was recorded almost 40 years ago! This is, I believe, their first record, and is by far the best. Start here and throw out your shabby altrock."
3,Not as good as the original that came with the car,"It has the shape and style of the original mirror that came with the truck, but it is not made from the same high quality materials its a cheap plastic knock off. It gets the job done but it will not last as long as the oem."
3,Fans of this book would enjoy Nelson Algren...,... who was a phenomenal writer. Algren did it before and did it better than Selby (especially in this book) which is similar to 'Never Come Morning' and several other titles of his.
5,this is just engaging prose!!!!!,this book got me into a land i haven't been before. one of the darkest books i have ever read. recommended
1,Unreadable,"The story seems decent but I found this book to be absolutely unreadable. The authors ""style"" is to never use quotation marks. This makes for huge confusing paragraphs where you're never sure if a character is talking thinking or narrating. I read the first chapter and put it down and will probably never finish it."
3,First Time Hubert Selby Jr. reader here,"I can only imagine how shocking this book looked when it was first written. It still appears to be shocking to me now, 50-some years after its creation. Yet, when you take away all the filth, gang rapes and knife fights descriptions, there's little left. That's not to say that there's no talent on display here, its just that its buried under descriptions of filth and degradation. While its not a complete throwaway/garbage, its not a claimed masterpiece either, at least in my opinion.Still, a lot can forgiven when you know that this was his debut novel. One can only hope that his subsequent works were more focused than ""Last Exit""."
2,It helped me go to sleep....,"This is the only book of the last fifty or so I have read that I just wanted to give up on. It was a distorted didactical load of the usual religious dogma. Yes, after 3 chapters I climbed out of my stupor to realize that each chapter (7 in all, of course) was unrelated other than that each was a relation of a christian sin to a world we are more familiar with. After that, I was able to entertain myself by seeing how quickly I could guess which sin was next as I started each chapter. I know what this book is ""supposed"" to represent, however, it is not worth reading unless you enjoy repetition and weak imaginations. My apologies for all the bitterness."
2,Same Sh** Different Day,"Clearly this book was written to shock and disgust the reader. It largely succeeeds.The overriding weakness of the book is that all the characters basically act, sound and view life in the same way. After reading a couple dozen pages I noiticed that you could simply insert the name of one male charater into the place of another and not really notice any difference.All the men are ignorant, physically abusive and shiftless drunks (of somewhat varying degrees). (...)I wonder if this work would have been more interesting if Selby took one of the stories in LEB (...say...""Strike""...) and provided more depth about the character's history and motivations.This work suffesrs from the same fatal flaw as Richard Wright's ""Native Son"" (although a much different work): the main character(s) is (are) simply unlikeable and repellant; the reader has no reason to care what happens to them."
2,"Enough already with the drag queens, Hubert!","Having grown up on the very streets of Brooklyn (albeit a decade and a half later) where Mr. Selby's storys take place, I am puzzled as to why drag queens populate every chapter of this book. You would think from this book that every adult male in Brooklyn wants to sleep with drag queens. Mr Selby took me in with his believabilty in each chapter only to lose me with his harping on gay lust. As I said, I grew up on the streets of Brooklyn in the late 60's and early 70's and with the exception of characters like Georgette and Alberta and Goldie all of the characters are REAL to me. He ruined a perfectly good book with his sexual obesessions. I wish he had written more about a greater cross-section of characters. This could have been a GREAT book, and alas, is only mildly interesting."
4,Its okay......,"I bought this cd only hearing one of the songs, I also was at a record store, so they had places where you could listen to this cd, and I listened to the first part of the first song and then decided that it was gonna be pretty cool, so I bought it. The only problem I have with this album is that a lot of the songs sound the same, which I don't really like. So, I'll listen to this album sometimes. I don't know if they changed their sound or anything, some people were saying stuff about this, so I don't know. This cd is good, but it could of been better."
1,FAIL.,"So irritating to hear these guys paint radio rock with a thin layer of metal, using the deteriorating skeleton of the ""Soilwork sound"" as a brush. So pitiable to hear Bjorn awkwardly [attempt to] hit notes outside his vocal range. So ironic the album cover is proportional to the music in terms of boringness.Oh, but then there's ""Blind Eye Halo,"" the obligatory pseudo-thrash snoozer. The inclusion of this song means Soilwork are as great as ever, evidently. Too bad the drug industry could sell bits of this song to cure insomnia.Basically, this album is fail. Try Chainheart Machine and A Predator's Portrait, those albums were Soilwork's peak."
5,Best Soilwork Album Ever! Better sound!,"This album sounds very modern! Everything have been improved... songwriting, overall sounds, drum playing, guitar sound & vocal line! You name it!If this album is TOO NU(read: new) for you... then you must be an OLDSCHOOL METAL fan! The answer is: UPGRADE your ears! Ignore below negative comments, you will like this album if you expect a great + high quality + modern recording sound! Soilwork rules! Killswitch Engage Rules! In Flames Rulez! Keep up the GOOD WORK! :)"
2,This is not Soilwork,"I feel bad for Soilwork fans. Soilwork has changed from melodic death metal to Nu-metal. Although I like this cd better than figure #5 which sucked beyond belief, this is a pretty good album if you are into nu-metal. Think simple riffs and classic hooks...that explains this album. If you want to listen to serious metal check out cipher system, bynight, mnenic, dark tranqulity and strid's side project with disarmonia mundi which kicks ass. I give this 2 stars because this is not Soilwork anymore...it is metal commercialized just like Killswitch and ill nino."
2,TOO MUCH HYPE - NOT THEIR VERY BEST AT ALL,"Not as good as ""NATURAL BORN CHAOS"" and ""FIGURE NUMBER FIVE"". Absent are the more melodious guitar solos and ambient keyboard atmospheres. It seems that they are trying to please the mindless brutal pit moshers. ""STABBING THE DRAMA"" will not be very memorable at all - they do not demonstrate any evolution whatsoever.Overall, I am not that fond of this band - they are way inferior to fellow countrymen OPETH and DARK TRANQUILITY. Their style of METAL sounds like some contrived hybrid of FEAR FACTORY, CHAIMERA, MESHUGGA & INFLAMES - a bit too cyber/industrial sounding with nu-metal/metalcore attributes. According to my taste and standards, this is not true METAL at all. Just alot of noise and punch. Anyone who says that this is some of the best metal they have ever heard probably does not have very diversified taste in music and not much listening experience.Spend no more than $3.00 for this."
2,Well it's not a COMPLETE trainwreck...,"I think Soilwork reached their peak with Natural Born Chaos. Figure Number Five showed us Soilwork reaching for a commercial direction, and Stabbing the Drama is the final execution of that idea.I want so bad to like this album, but I could only recoil in horror as ""Fate in Motion"" played through and I came to the realization that it sounded like a Korn song. I don't even mean ""one riff sounded Kornish"" or ""this chorus sounds Korn-like"", but the SONG AS A WHOLE.There are moments of their past glory scattered about an album which is, as a whole, mostly commercial nu-metal pop trash. As an example, while I like chocolate, I don't especially like feces with chocolate chunks mixed in.A tolerable album, but mediocre and a slap in the face to their previous work. Melodic death metal fans should buy Dark Tranquillity - Character or Insomnium - Since The Day It All Came Down instead."
2,Not a winner,"I thought this album would have really stood out from the other soilwork albums, the vocals aren't strong enough, the heaviness in this album is a low down, pretty calm and mellow, (track 3) weapon of vanity probably a good track. 2 stars; one for the mixed around drum work, and another star for the bonus track."
4,Good enough for me (edit): Best metal album of the year!,"Soilwork is not one of my favorite bands, but I do enjoy them. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound on this album. It is tight, aggressive, and melodic (in places). The album has grown on me with every listen. Overall I think it is a solid piece of work. (Edit): After listening to this CD way too many times now, I think it rocks. This is perhaps the best metal release of the year! I would change my review to 5 stars if I could."
2,These guys are from gothemburg?,"Come on guys this albumn is not amazing or briliant. I mean aside from a few decent riffs, this hinges on nu-metal. I hate to say this about a band that Dark Tranquility actually praised but its true. The songs ,as stated in other reviews, are simple and extremely formulated. The are some catchy songs but hell nu-metal and metalcore have these. I read the albumn label and it said the Swedish Metal Masters are back, come on. They should be considered lucky to be in the same breath as the three kings (In Flames, Dark Tranquility, At the Gates) of Swedish Metal. If your into Mudvayne or Slipknot buy this. If you like hellashiously kick ass music buy early In Flames or DT."
1,What the hell happened?,What is this crap? Chainheart Machine was a great album and then I hear this as their new release. There is nothing good about this CD the vocals sound like a little girl crying and the music sounds like Korn of some other crap amercian metal band. Soilwork has lost their touch. I didnt believe they did until I saw them live with Dark Tranquillity. I had to leave 30 seconds into their set and I heard they played a half hour longer <_<This CD deserves a 0. Any true metal fan should aviod this at all costs
3,no,"Soilwork used to have solo's in almost every one of their songs. Then FNF came.. it wasnt a bad cd, its just not something people want to hear from soilwork.Stabbing the drama is the same. its really good, but not Soilwork-good. there is only like 4 solo's on the whole cd, and they are all short. the guitarists dont use their full talent like they did on Steelbath(1997?)- till NBC(2002).they have softened.. alot.NBC is soilwork's best cd, i think.the best songs on stabbing the drama are:1- Stabbing the drama3- weapon of vanity10- blind eye halo12- wherever thorns may growthe others dont really stand out as much. Weapon of vanity doesnt have a solo or anything, but the chorus is genuis"
3,i like but.....,Don't let the 3 out of 5 stars fool you. I like this cd because there are a few songs that really are great. The rest of the cd is a little bit boring to me. definetly worth a few listens but after that not so much.
5,Good stuff!,"I recently heard ""Nerve"" on XM radio. Decided to look into the band a little bit, and now I can't take them out of the CD player. This is a great new sound that I have been looking for for quite some time. Really heavy when it needs to be, but can mellow out also. The mastering is perfect for playing the cd in the car. Tight and powerfull kick drums really show off the drummers ability. The guitars sound as if a Mesa Head/Cab was directly mic'd with very few effects coloring up the sound. I have told everyone about this disc. If you are into Mudvayne, Sevendust, Taproot, then definitely check these guys out. Peace."
2,So-so book.,"This really isn't as ""unauthorized"" as the title would lead you to believe. It's filled with everyday trivia. Nothing scandalous or shocking. Not interesting."
1,101 things you never knew about Disneyland,The title of this book should be 101 Things You Really Don't Need to Know About Disneyland. It was a complete waste of money and not at all interesting to read.
1,What a Dud,This book is loaded with lots of uninteresting information. The other positive reviews for this pamphlet/book must have been submitted by friends & family. I love Disneyland and there are plenty of good travel guides to get you around the park with important and interesting insider information but this isn't it. Painfully boring from start to finish. For example: #77 Did you know that the giant mushroom at the loading zone of Alice in Wonderland is a former ticket booth? A complete waste of money. Also a waste of time although it only took about 15 minutes to read cover to cover.
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book, and to find out more on the ""back story"" of Disneyland. Unfortunately, the book's promise of ""little touches"" was a little too accurate. (I did not buy the book only to find out that the number on a boat was based on someone's birthday.) This book would have made a nice magazine article, but the average person probably would have moved on to the next article before finishing. The writing style is not the problem, there is just not enough background to be interesting enough to justify $14.95 plus shipping."
1,101 things you shouldn't waste your money on. Boring book!,"I'm not sure who Kevin Yee sees as his target audience. Obviously this book would appeal to the ""hardcore"" Disney fans, however these ""things"" are about as in-depth and ""unauthorized"" as a people magazine profile. These things seem to be directed to someone who perhaps has never been to Disneyland. Waste of money, and he has two of these things! Step up and get some good stuff in these when you have a title such as this! Who never knew this stuff? Mildly amusing at best, and a complete lack of skill when it comes to the actual writing. Skip it."
2,Disappointing,"I, being an avid Disney fan love to find out the little quirks about my favorite place on earth. However, these 101 things you never knew were 101 things even my child knew. Aside from the ""101 things"" listed are already in many Disney books, the book is poorly written. It reminds me of high school where when assigned an essay that had to 101 pages, every effort was used to double space, use the widest ruled paper available and write r e a l l y w i d e so you'd fill your assignment. To a Disney fan, very disappointing. To a fourth grader, rather insightful."
1,disneyland book,I didnt think this book was worth the money. Alot of the things I knew about disneyland already and I have only had 3 trips there in my life.
4,IPE Reader aimed at students new to IPE,"Frieden and Lake are two very well-established scholars in the IPE field. In this book they have presented 31 articles of academic journal quality in a manner that is accessbile to students with little or no IPE knowledge. Having some fundamental knowledge of micro-economics, specifically comparative advantage (the underlying rationale as to why globalization is occuring and what it really is), can be helpful in understanding some of the subject matter. The book is divided into seven main sections: 1)Contending Perspectives on IPE, 2) Historical Perspectives, 3)Production, 4) Money and Finance, 5) Trade, 6) Economies in Development and Transition, and 7) Current Problems in IPE. As is evident from the sections in the book, this is a fairly thorough look at IPE, what it was, is, as well as what it could be in the future. Would be five stars but some of the articles were quite redundant (as is oft the case with books dealing with economic subject matter)."
1,Really really boring,This book provides a bunch of politically motivated exerpts that provide nothing more than endless boredom.
3,Short but poignant,"This is more of a love story than anything else. We see a story about the type of racism that existed during that time (World War II). It is ironic that Michener tells the other side of the story, letting you know that the Japanese were also scared of losing their identity and heritage (so they acted in some racist ways). The Americans; I guess they were afraid of anybody who wasn't white. But in the end we find how tragic it can be when people are not tolerant."
5,Beautiful and heartbreaking,"I have just began to read Michener's novels, but have enjoyed none more than Sayonara. It varies from his typical writing style... he writes with passionate human emotion to describe racism, love, and culture. This is an amazing and important novel for Americans. Although the story line is somewhat predictable, the language is simple and graceful. It glows with insight on contrasting Japanese ideas on land, country, and marriage. I couldn't get enough of this book. It was spectacular."
3,Moldy oldy,"If you have truly ancient hardware but still need access to something on it, it can be useful. Otherwise, almost anything else is better."
5,Almost too good for the $,"Canon 12x36 Image Stabilization II Binoculars w/Case, Neck Strap & BatteriesI ordered these for wildlife viewing while on vacation this year. The image stabilization works exceptionally well. The stabilization allowed me to see wildlife at great distances. The only drawback was that these binoculars work so well that I had a hard time trying to get them back from my traveling companions. I am going to buy another pair of these for a gift and Amazon's price is hard to beat."
5,Mountain and celestial views,"I like to view the mountains from 4 to 30 miles from my house and these are perfect for this. The IS works great, without it, I would need a tripod to see what I'm seeing. Also great for moon viewing."
5,Binoculars for all of life,"I use these binoculars for stargazing as well as bird watching. They are wonderful! The binocs have two shortcomings: no lens covers for objective lenses; and no tripod mount. I've been able to remedy both issues by purchasing items at the links below. The first link is for Schneider 58mm push on lens caps; the second is for a Nikon binoc-u-mount, which allows for tripod mounting.[...][...]"
5,Canon 12x36 Is,Bought these for hunting the plains of Wyoming where you do a lot of back country driving and glassing. With these you can be moving and still have an image that is stable enough to identify an animal at tremendous distances. Love these canon IS binoculars.
5,Canon Delivers,"Canon's 12x36 IS II Binoculars are well worth the investment. After lugging around an old 12x50 non-IS for 20 years, the Canon is lighter, brighter, better balanced and better contoured. The IS is impressive to say the least, and so easy a caveman could do it! Lots of Pros for this one. The only Con are the lens dust caps, or more accurately the eyepiece dust caps. We managed to lose one of them in the first half hour on the trail. They don't grip real well. Now when we use the binocs we carry them in their soft case at all times, leaving the caps behind in the truck so they don't get lost. Best binocs I've ever had, and I've had quite a few over the years. Can't go wrong with this one."
3,Canon 12x36 IS Binoculars,Own a vintage 2000 Canon IS 10x? bino and the stab system seemed to work better than this pair. They aren't as steady as my old one which I've sent back to Canon for repair.Maybe it's the extra 2x that makes the system seem less stabilized.
2,All About Electronic (A.A.E} Amazon vendor.,"I cannot give a review of the Canon 12x36 Stabilization II Binoculars is because the Pair ordered in late November for a Christmas present came without a Warranty Card, and at best gray market merchandise. I returned then to A.A.E. because after numerous calls they would not furnish the Canon/USA warranty. Then even with a return Return Authorization Number A.A.E played the ""We didn't get it game"". It took a Federal Express Investigator to smoke the binocular out. Today I may still be out some $600.00, as the case is still pending with Discover Card.The good news is bought a pair of Steiner Binoculars for a little more from Optics Planet, Inc with a full 30 year warranty and a factory new product.To date I no of no action take by Amazon to help me (their customer) or any action take against their unscrupulous 3rd party vendor.Today you pay for everything you get, but don't get what you pay for."
3,Canon vs Fujinon,"Image stabilising makes 12x or higher magnification usable; without it anything much over 7X is of little benefit. These binoculars are easy to use and compensate for hand shake very well, and have good optics. Very good binoculars for most uses.If you are more demanding of the optics- particularly chromatic aberration - and need stabilisation against gentle movement of a boat or vehicle consider something like Fujinon 12x 32s, though they are bit heavier and not quite so user friendly."
1,More Cheap Junk To Avoid,"The stockpot arrived badly dented even though the box showed no damage whatsoever. Even if it hadn't been dented, the steel is of such unbelievably light weight that I have to doubt it would have worked out. Once again, one gets what one pays for!"
3,Cookware,"This pot is made of thin stainless steel. I don't know how long it will last. Otherwise, it's fine."
3,Havoc Heli Review,"I paid $24.99 for a blue heli, Channel ""B"", at Walmart for it. It was located in the kids toy section. The helo easy to fly and easier to crash. I am unsure how people break the rear prop. The rear rudder snapped off and after a battle with a wall. I was able to super glue it until my 2 yr old grabbed the heli and ran away. If the rear rudder is secure it will fly w/o spinning in circles. I don't know if the glue will hold for me this time. The sticker/rudder is ripped and its integrity is comprimised.It is a decent toy for some Tom Foolery. The cat seems interested in it, however, I cannot keep it flying straight to chase him.Save some money on batteries and and opt for some rechargeables like Energizer, I guess Duracell has some out now too.I will probably inquire about another mini Heli sometime but from Tower Hobbies or somewhere else instead of Walmart.Happy Holidays!!"
2,Poor internal battery,"I purchased this Copter at the State Fair for 13.00 and I had fun with it, but the internal battery malfunctioned in two days or after 20 charges. Also, it would not move forward, other than turning in a left circle. It was fun while it lasted and I babied it, but it broke unexpectantly and you can not replace the internal battery."
4,Good price:,"This necklace is smooth and sleek, comfortable to wear. It, however is not shiny. A good value for the price"
5,This one is a must,"I can't stress how deeply this book moved me. As a child of the North I simply didn't know that such conditions existed. Yes, I was well read and also active in civil rights in the early fifties, nevertheless, I didn't nor could I know about the agonies and fear of everyday life. Ms Byers does a brilliant job of bringing to life - a small Georgia family over a number of years but most of the action happens over one hot summer in post-world war II United States. This book should be required reading for Americans and would be eye-opening for most Europeans."
4,The 40's and 50's were hard times in the deep south.,"Growing up sheltered in a small town in Georgia the author learned lessons of faith and courage by watching the examples of her parents and their friends. The author deals openly with race, poverty and disease. Many of us who are familiar with her time and location identify with the trials of the family. Others will learn more about the daily life of small southern towns before the era of civil rights ."
1,Same people who rave about this movie here....,"seem to be the same as those who do so on IMDB. And this smells fishy to me. I saw this movie in theater and thought the process of my brain must be so twisted and different from those earlier reviewers. The acting was amateurish, the production design was mediocre and the direction is aimless, the script was abysmal. And the DVD sells for $25!!! I think I'd better give this amount of money to some charity organizations; it would be more fulfilling and life-affirming."
2,Proproganda for Radical Change,"This is nothing but proprogand for radical change in China during the 1930 or so. I read this for a Asian History class and I understand why we read it. It shows how the young strongly wanted change if not anarchy (look up history and term. it means has a differant meaning what you might think). But as a story it was a very superficial, melodramtic romance. But it does have its place in history. If anything, this might make your interest grow in Chinese-political history."
5,Interesting...,"I had to get this book for my modern lit class. I must say, however, that the teacher was right when she said we'd find it interesting as a stand-alone book! I'm only through the first 100 pages, but it's a very good read, especially for a book written in the 1930's. It could have easily been written by someone from this decade! I can't wait to read the rest."
5,Music to cuddle to,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this album. I discovered Dr. John from this. Every song on this album is wonderful. It does have a lot of big band sound (tho also lots of quiet jazz accompaniment). But really, it is soulwarming--you just LIKE the guy from listening to him. I am just now coming onto Amazon to buy some more Dr. John - so I have no idea how this compares to other choices. Just that it's great for itself."
3,Smooth Baby,"""AfterGlow"" is a fabulous collection of big-band classics, with a couple of originals thrown in for good measure. From the rolling piano intro of ""I Know What I Got,"" which soon bursts forth into a glorious blaze of horns, you know this is going to be a special album. And indeed it is. The Doctor's gravelly voice is a perfect compliment to Tommy LiPuma's smooth arrangements, which sound both authentic to the period and nicely up-to-date. Highlights include the opening number, ""Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You,"" ""I'm Just a Lucky So & So"" and ""There Must Be A Better World Somewhere,"" a Dr John tune originally recorded by BB King. Oddly enough, his take on ""Blue Skies"" falls flat, and the album seems to trail off rather than make a definitive final statement. That said, however, ""Afterglow"" is an album I always pull out when I need that distingue ambience."
2,Not Her Finest Work,"Everyone else has recapped the story, so I won't do that. However, I read this book many years ago and then re-read after this purchase. I find the same things wrong with it today as then. I thought the heroine was too whiny and a wee bit self-involved. I got a bit irritated by the massive pity-party. I am a huge Dorothy Garlock fan and this is the only book she has ever written that I have not been emotionally engaged. Which is ironic since the subject matter would normally have me in tears, just the thought of recovery and going on. The hero was not much better, I didn't know who I wanted to slap first. Although, I am married to a man as decent and kind, so they really do exist!"
1,Mike Schiano is the best,"The book is just like his radio show: informative and easy to understand. I learned a lot from this book and using this information, my wife and I were able to save for our dream house. I follwed Mike's advice through In Charge Institute and feel like he is a trusted family member."
1,Mother of 2,I bought this car seat because my daughter car seat (triumph 5) didn't fit her properly. She was slouched all the time and the 5 pt harness was above her ears. SO we decided to buy this one cause i did like the turn dial to tighten the kids on the evenflo. But this car seat IS NOT SAFE!!!!! the sides wobble so much and if my son had this car seat the arm rest would be broken. The other thing is that is seats so LOW my daughter can't see out the window. So needless to say this car seat is going back tomorrow and I am buying my sons car seat which is the Cosco Summit. We have has ZERO PROBLEMS with this seat.
2,Injurs children in accidents,"I thought when I bought this seat it was perfect. It had armrests that appeared they would hold up well to the average 2 year old tugging on them...I was wrong. They snapped off completely within about 3 weeks of having it. That was not the worse part though. I have an Audi A4, which got the highest crash test rating for side impact collisions, and was hit on the passenger side of the car by a lady who ran the red light. The car seat held up well...but the head supports on the side of the chair that are supposed to be a luxury of the chair actually injured my childs face. The support was crushed into her temple. I do not reccommend this chair to anybody!! I am actually in the process of writing Evenflo and requesting a redesign of the chair since it obviously has some flaws."
2,Daughter is stuck in the seat....,"I bought this because it was recommended to me in the store and I read the reviews which seemed reasonable for the most part. I gave it the 2 stars I did because my daughter is comfortable in it. However, when I pull the silver release down to get her out, it refuses to work. One side doesn't work at all and the other one on the other side (which of course is not the one by the door) works only after several tries. Lucky for me my daughter is patient. One time it took us 5 minutes to get her out. That is a long time for a 3 year old. It also sits very low and the cup holder is a joke since it clearly states not to use it with any hard cups, only styrofoam or paper. In the car we use sippie cups to help eliminate spills. I think a cup holder for a kid car seat should hold cups made for kids. I am returning it to the store and about to try the Eddie Bauer one. I hope I have better luck. I miss my Britax seats."
4,Big Fan,"I just love this seat. We had the triumph carseat and handed it down to my infant, and bought this seat for our 3 year old daughter. She loves the arm rests and we haven't had any problems with them. She also likes the fact she can see out the windows of the SUV. It fits securly in our Tahoe using the LATCH and tether straps and we feel it is very safe for our daughter. The buckle is short but I have found if she is sitting properly not to have a problem with pinching. She rode in it for an 8 hour roadtrip and no complaints. Its lightweight so its easy to switch in and out of vehicles. I love the knobs on the sides to adjust the straps. I think its a carseat for toddlers vs. some of the older infants who are big enough to use this seat. I would highly recommend to anyone and will buy another one when my 2nd daughter is ready for one. LOVE IT!!!!!!"
2,Lousy Product!!,"I bought 3 of these and the arm rests fell off of all 3! They are also very flimsy in general, the crotch buckle is difficult to use and the seat padding just gets in the way. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!"
2,"Looks great, but isn't","I bought this seat last night and was confident that I would love it as much as my Evenflo Triumph V. Boy, was I wrong. I love that it is latch compatible. But as many other parents have said, the straps cut across your child's thighs instead of resting on the hips where they belong. The buckle between the legs is placed impossibly close to the body even after adjustment, so that it crushes the child (especially not good for the little boys). My son immediately complained that the buckle hurt his crotch and that he didn't like it.If anyone has had luck with a good, LATCH compatible carseat, please let me know. I'm feeling like there's little hope of finding a safe, comfortable seat."
2,APPEARANCES ARE DECEIVING,"MY DAUGHTER LOVED HER NEW EVENFLO SEAT WHEN I INSTALLED IT INTO OUR SUV. SHE LOVED THE COLOR AND THE ""COOL"" ARMREST BUT LOOKS ARE ONE THING AND SAFETY IS ANOTHER. THIS BOOSTER SEAT LOOKS VERY STURDY BUT I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SIDES OF THIS SEAT WHICH ARE VERY FLIMSY, ESPECIALLY THE ARMRESTS. ALSO, THIS IS NOT A GOOD SEAT OF YOUR CHILD HAS CHUBBY LEGS. THE LOCKING MECHANISM SNAPS RIGHT ONTO HER THIGHS, EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING THE STRAPS. I RETURNED THIS AND INSTEAD PURCHASED THE EDDIE BAUER BOOSTER AND AM QUITE PLEASED WITH IT."
2,Armrest broke off after 2 weeks of minor use,"I love the look of this car seat and it has great features. I didn't love the fact that my son was very uncomfortable in it. I bought it because of the safety features but also for the fact that it had armrests. To my dismay after two weeks of minor use, the right armrest broke off. I returned and opted for a different Evenflo product ""Traditions Booster CarSeat."" I am very happy with this product. Same great features plus armrests, but a lot more sturdy."
2,Falling arm rest,Just to let everyone know if you already have this car seat and the arm rest have fallen off Evenflo is aware there is a problem and are replacing the whole car seat free of charge. I have two that have broken arm rest. The positive on this is Evenflo was great when I called and quick to replace the seat.
1,Arms Broke,"We bought two of these one for my mother and one for my own car and it is horrible, the arms broke off with in 2 months and the drink holder is so flimsy you can not put a sippy cup or any cup that weighs anything! The buckle slips down underneath the seat it is a logistic nightmare trying to get a squirming 3 year old in, do not buy you will be disapointed!"
2,flimsy,"I am used to a Britax marathon. My infant son needed the Britax, so I needed another carseat. We looked high & low for booster/convertible seats to find the right one. We bought this evenflo seat and when I got it out of the box, I realized how flimsy the design is. You can take the armrest and wiggle the whole carseat with one move. It is just not a great design. We are returning it."
2,I too must agree this seat has problems!!,the armrest has fallen off of my sons to and actually pinched his arm so badly over the summer while returning from vacation..the drink holder cannot be used because it is so cheap it simply dumps the drink so it was a waste to put it on the seat..I am looking for a new seat now...
1,Don't buy it...,"I am a big Who fan, and have been since 1981... this album is truly bad. I bought the double LP of this concert in 1983 when it came out. The mix is muddy beyond belief, Daltrey's vocals are buried and sounds like he is gargling. The guitar is... difficult to describe, there's no 'snarl' like you find in other recordings...it sounds bleary and tired. There are virtually no solos...just monotonous windmilling chords in the place of vibrancy. The drumming is wooden and passionless, it is everything you don't expect from the who. I can't think of any reason at all to buy this except to see how 'by the numbers' they had become. All other live recordings of the who are good to brillant... this should never have been released... let alone rereleased."
2,Childs view,"I little on the childish side of how life was on the ranch, that is more of a childs view and not how people lives went on while living there."
3,Great family movie; poor reproduction,"This movie is a treasured memory from my childhood; along with The Grinch and It's a Wonderful Life, The Snow Queen was a Christmas TV staple until it just vanished. Finding it 30 years later was tough, but worth it. This Russian film is wonderful family viewing (although the sappy Art Linkletter intro is skippable), and you almost have to forgive the extremely poor quality of the print (which includes obivous missing chunks) and awful sound. Still, the story of the indomitable Gerda searching for her kidnapped brother rings as true as ever, and is also a welcome ""girl empowerment"" tale. Of course, it's harder to square the fact that the evil character is yet another dangerously cold woman ala almost every Disney baddie, but at least this one is drawn more along the lines of C.S. Lewis' queen. If you're willing to overlook the technical difficulties with this DVD, you'll find a wonderful story that has not faded with time."
2,"Dim transfer, lousy DVD","Lovely Soviet animated film from 1957, marred by a badly faded, scratched, and spliced print. The English language track, featuring Tommy Kirk and Sandra Dee, dates from the film's 1959 US release -- as does the live-action prologue with Art Linkletter. No Russian-language soundtrack here, folks. The video transfer is so dim and grainy that night scenes are all but unwatchable. For such a steep retail price, this DVD is an insult. An average dollar-bin disc looks better."
5,Nice book for collectors ànd stitchers.,"When you are - as I am - passioned about (traditional) samplers, stitching and embroidery, you need to buy books from Brenda Keyes.This books gives you nice and clearly traditional patterns. You are also shown how to use them in modern arrangements. Very good technical support.I don't need to tell you how nice it is to have this book in your little sampler librabry. You can look at it as much as you like.Nice book in very good condition. Excellent seller : good packed and quickly send.Negative : expensive international postal costage."
3,Disappointing..............,"I thought this book paled in comparison to Brenda Keye's other book, The Sampler Motif Book.....I ended up giving it away...."
5,Powerfull Story!,"Do you know who your neighbors are? This book is one of the reasons I don't like having neighbors. I was 14 years old when I first read this book; I am now 23. I have read this book over 100 times and I can pick it up and reread it. I love this book! Sissy was my Aunt at one time and the story of what had happened was true. This book goes inside the mind of George and show the true side of him, a cold blooded killer. I recommend this book for everyone to read as it shows you that you don't really know what your neighbors are capable of until it is too late."
1,One-sided,"George Trepal has been a friend of mine since the mid 1980s, long before he was accused of this crime. What bothers me about this book is also what bothered me about the investigation: that other people with motive, means and opportunities were not thoroughly investigated, and that the victims continued to be poisoned while in the hospital and not within George's so called reach. I do not know if George did the crime, but I do think this book is a reflection of the real crime here, and that is of professionals doing a poor job of examining all of the facts before rushing to judgment. I think an impartial review of the facts does not lead to guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. George may have indeed committed this crime, but I think he was falsely convicted of said. This book could have looked at that aspect better. Djordan@cfl.rr.com"
5,MURDER was the case,"This album is one of the all time greats. Including Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre. I think anyone who has heard this album would agree with me, wheather you are a Snoop or Dre fan this album is tight. I suggest you pick it up and give it a listen, you will soon to be a fan of this classic. This CD is really the old school Snoop, with tight beats and fu<k!n awsome lyrics, in such songs as ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""U better recognize"". I guaruntee you will love this album, and I am very picky when it comes to music."
5,Thought You Knew...,"Back in the day when I was a teenager (not a kid anymore), I thought ""Murder Was The Case"" was the darkest thing I had ever heard. After revisiting this album years later, I realized just how dark it actually is. The beats are still hard as hell the lyrics still relevant and the production top dogg notch."
5,Murder Was The Case Review,"This is one of my favorite soundtracks to listen to next to Above The Rim, which is another classic soundtrack. This is a must for any true music fan!"
3,MURDER WAS THE CASE,Not the best album from death row netha the less its still got sum tite tracks and sum good artists doesnt compare to above the rim sountrack though. IF ur a fan of death row records its probably worth a buy.
2,Woman To Woman,Jewell Woman 2 Woman is the only reason I have this Soundtrack. When I first heard that song I knew I had to buy Murder Was Case. I love that song so much and Im glad that I have it. The rest of the songs are okay I guess. I nevered really listened to the other tracks besides the ones released as singles. Its funny how a great R&B song like Woman 2 Woman made it on hardcore rap album. I gave this soundtrack 2 stars one for Jewell and another one for the singles.
3,"Longer mixes than volume 1, more vocals...","Overall, I think this is a better volume with more energy. It's great to get a bunch of Rauhofer's diva anthem mixes. And while some tracks are quite short, a couple of goodies run over 7 minutes. Track times:1. found a cure (7:49)2. Rollerblade (6:01)3. Comin Back (7;14)4. The Way (6:29)5. Perfect Love (9:07)6. Future's Overrated (5:13)7. I Need Love (7:43)8. Walk (3:30)9. Until The Day (5:43)10. Magic Orgasm (4:44)11. Brand New Day (4:49)12. love of life (4:59)"
5,The better of the two volumes--some excellent house cuts,"Pretty much ditto for what I said in my review of vol. 1, though I find the overall feel and track selection of this CD to be superior to that one. I consider this a must-buy because it includes what are (in my opinion) the three best Club 69 mixes I've heard so far: ""Until the Day"" and ""The Way"" (both by Funky Green Dogs) and ""Perfect Love"" (by House of Prince--contrary to the amazon.com track listing, THIS is track #5)."
1,Petered-out.,"If you've heard one Peter Rauhofer mix, you've heard them all. Why he chose to include the tedious Future mix of ""Magic Orgasm"" is beyond me. The original funk mix of that tune is the only cut Peter has ever produced that has any staying power. If you like predictable, cookie-cutter tribal hump tracks, get this. If not, then wait ""Until The Day"" something good comes along."
5,Great for just declawed kitten,I bought this for my recently spayed and declawed kitten. worked great! Since her surgery and now that she has healed i have kept using it because there is no DUST!! how awesome is that??!!
4,third best album by family,"i'd say that the first is the best, the second second best. this album contains some of their best work but isnt quite at the level of its predecessors. drowned in wine is one of their greatest tunes and has to be heard i just can;'t describe it to you although i guess you could say that it partly sounds like circus music at ear splitting level! the title track is another classic , as is song for sinking lovers , a ballad with fine violin and interesting vocalizing. wheels is another great cut dating from when ric grech was in the band. some of the other cuts arent very intriguing but overall its a good though not great album worth really a 3.5 rating."
5,Magnificent!,"that is, if a piece of Reiki music can be described as such. It is entirely beyond that dimension where superlatives matter. I also enjoyed the precursor to this CD, Cho Ku Rei, which I recommend highly as well. I thought that one was the best music for Reiki around--that is, until I heard this one. As with the difference in energy levels between the first and second degrees in Reiki, these two CDs move the practitioner and patient to higher levels and stimulate the different centers where healing begins. Even if you're not a Reiki practitioner, this music will uplift you, relax you, and help make you whole."
5,"Review of ""Sei He Ki"" by Weave","I actually already have this disc and ordered two more for friends. I hope it goes back into distribution. It is extremely well done and one does not have to be familiar with Reiki to enjoy it. It is great for relaxation. It is not ""pretty piano music"" type stuff. It is more intense. Waves of sound."
2,Stange noise,"I purchased this item because I heard this cd at a friends house and loved it. When it finally arrived there was a strage sound in the recording. Every three minutes there is a sound that is very disrupting. I wanted to use the cd for healing work, but just as you start to get deeply relaxed there is a sound almost like bamboo dropping. So I won't use it. Also the jacket of the cd is all written in spanish. I didn't realize i ordered it from argentina and the cd cover is written in spanish and i don't read spanish. so i would say all around not such a good product. won't order from that company again."
1,Hummm...,"I was surprised to see the CD arrive from Argentina but was none-the -less glad as I had had this CD before and it is a wonderful meditation CD. However, I thought this was a bootlegged copy because there are really weird grinding engine noises mixed in! I am very unhappy with this recording."
5,"A nice set for a beginning guitar, decent sound, decent quality.","I had been looking at guitars for a while for a hobby, but passed them up because i didn't want to pay the price for something I might not use much. But, this year I finally got one, picking up this model at closeout at a nationwide retailer. I have had it a week, and Comparing it to other entry models available (first act, some yamaha's), there seems to be more quality to the construction. it also came with a poster, signed number card and guitar, as well as the strap and picks. Listing at 199.99 new, this is a great bargin here on amazon, and it has decent sound. I just have to learn to play mine better, and computer programs are available here on amazon as well. Great instrument for beginners."
4,A fascinating Dickensian tale,"I liked this book. It was a tough read, but at the same time it was a page turner. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. Its subject and its characters are utterly original. The atmosphere evoked by the language and the setting reminds me of Dickens."
2,Not so Great Stink,"Although I admire Clare Clark's effort and the amount of time she must have researched before writing this novel, a story of murder in the sewers of London in the 1850's, wasn't enough to hold my interest. I think she has great writing ability. Her descriptions in the sewer are palpable but could not hold the paper thin plot together. Nice try but I pass."
2,Unpleasant reading,"This book was very well written, but i gave it only 2 stars because reading page after page about the contents of the London sewers was extremely unpleasant to me. I had a general idea of what I was getting into when I started reading, but was still unprepared for what was to come. Stories don't have to be ""pretty"" for me to enjoy them, and I read a lot murder mysteries with no problem. I had to take a log shower after reading this book."
1,not for me,"The book concerns a man who works in the actual sewers below the streets of London. I expected that from the description but what I didn't expect was the lengthy and vivid descriptions of floating feces, mold, and rats...including descriptions of characters actually falling into the above. It was so vivid I actually felt sick after the first few chapters and stopped reading."
3,I Had Such Hopes . . .,"I didn't care for THE GREAT STINK, but not for the reasons many other readers here have given. I couldn't even finish it. I found the description fascinating. The author was masterful with description, a fine talent. And the characters were interesting. But oh, pleeeease, SO MUCH narrative and not nearly enough dialogue. The author only told us what was going on and rarely showed it. We were walked through what could have been truly engaging and interesting chapters, like being rushed through a guided tour. Delineated scenes were scant. Unless the book got better after page 90--when I gave up--I'm not sure what the hoopla is all about."
5,Where's the tidy bowl man when you need him,"The characters and descriptions of 19th century London seemed very real. People who romanticize and galmorize the past should read this novel. Life was brutish and short. The corruption in bidding the brick consignment is timeless. It makes you think of all the government contract fraud cases that end up on ""60 minutes"". I salute all the medical people, scientists and engineers thru whose efforts at cleaning up our water and sewers have enabled us to live healthy lives.Don't read this while your eating. However,if you like to read in the john, this book will have added meaning."
2,The cruel irony of a too revealing title.,"The descriptive passages are far more artful than the vast majority of common fiction on the market. But what fun are beautiful words about ugly subjects such as sewer stench, rotting corpses, dog fights, and the twisted dreams of the delirious? It is more gross than engrossing. And by the end of the book the only character I cared about was the dog. Clearly, the author has great talent, but this book wastes a lot of eloquent prose for want of a compelling plot and characters worth knowing."
1,title says it all,"There must be 5,000 ways to describe the effluvia of London, and unfortunately for the reader, Clark attempts them all.She breaks up the crap with tepid, repetitive descriptions of self-mutilation and rollicking accounts of rat-fighting terriers.The only person in the book who might possibly, one day, crack a smile is the main character's wife, who is, of course, a cardboard-character imbecile.Yuck. Repulsive. And I deal with gore and feces everyday at work. I love the grim picture of the author on the book jacket. No doubt she's a barrel of laughs at a dinner party."
4,Great stink does NOT,Very interesting setting and storyline. The writing is sophisticated and well done. I would recommend this book to others who are not just searching for a quick mindless read.
4,Worth the slog,"The Bookschlepper recommends The Great Stink by Clark but be forewarned: you can't snack and read this book at the same time! Two men deal with the sewers of mid-19th C. London. One is an engineer with PTSD from the Crimean War. One is Long Arm Tom who raids the sewers of rats for pub entertainment. After a serious drought, the powers-that-be decide a new sewer system is needed and the monumental effort beneath the city is undertaken. In the old sewers, flushed by the tides into the Thames, murder occurs, corruption simmers. Life among the newly-formed middleclass and the huddled masses is shown in stark light and the ever-present smog. Slog through the descriptions; Clark sets up the story vividly. The resolution in quick and a bit serendipitous but this is fiction. Most memorable character: Lady, a pink-eyed ratter, duplicated by the pink-eyed lawyer."
3,A Bit Skeptical,"The book is a good read. But - I agree with both reviewers below: The editing is atrocious; and the fact-checking was careless. There are some outright doubtful statements. The Lana Turner story involves the shooting of her lover by her daughter. This took place in 1958. The book describes the event as ""the new Hollywood scandal which had already been dubbed 'Lanagate'."" Lanagate? As in Watergate? The Watergate affair took place in 1972. Those Hollywood types must be psychic, eh?"
4,Works well even with PDA's,"This model has worked well, while finding a suitable mouting spot in my 89 Tempo was difficult, I ended up deciding this was a great model as it held my PDA and MP3 player without slipping (PDA = Handspring Visor, which barely fit, but made it with a little force) Just not as durable as I would wish."
1,Complete waste of money,I got this product and was a sheer waste of money. It did not come with an attachment to connect in the car. So I dont know what/how I can use it.
3,Encorages Bilingualism and Culture,"Last May (1999) I finished my fifth year of Spanish. For two and a half years my class used Destinos. After the AP exam, of the 7 Students who took this years exam, 4 non-native ""4's"" and one non-native ""5"". I myself and a much stonger speaker now that I am in college. Destinos promoted speaking from day one and it gave real results. I am exceling in my cuture classes and also with different Spanishes (mex, castilano, argentinian) Destinos gives a well rounded look on the Hispanic Culture. I enjoyed following the charaters through their journeys (video series). I highly recommend this text/video series too all."
1,NOT INTERESTING,"The plot itself was not interesting at all, the characters seem to have been doing the same thing for a long time! I really didn't like Raquel's character and the ending was a great dissapointment!"
2,Too Wide?,"The frame of this bed seemed a few inches too wide for the box spring. I had to shift my full sized bed several times and center it close to the edge of either side to keep it from falling between the side slats of the frame. The middle slat is the reason the bed has not collapsed entirely to the floor. The shipping cost was, in my opinion, way too expensive. The frame does serve the purpose it was intended for, but you will save a lot of money by going out and buying one instead of having it shipped."
2,Beware of grease!,"The frame works well. I needed a frame that supported a headboard and footboard and this fit-the-bill.However, there is excessive grease at the hinges. I stained my new sofa when I accidentally touched the hinge of the frame against the sofa cushion."
1,"bad,because after few days they said that the idem is undeliberable","they never send me the idem,because they didn,t want to pay for delivery, so i still looking for the same idem"
3,Very disappointed in this series!!!,I came in thinking this show was gonna be everything but it ain't! It's an average show and I thought this dvd of the rest was the worst point in the show. I was very disappointed in the character development the witch powers always being where they can move things with their minds. ALWAYS! I swear I have counted around 5 witches in this show that has the same power!!! The creators could of thinked up something much better. but anyway the only episode that I thought was a good episode was the first on this dvd called Missing.If I was you skip this dvd and maybe even the series. I have gotten all the 5 dvd's that have come out too and i'm very dissapointed in this series!
3,"Ok hikes, good history","I only visted Yosemite. I would only recommend this book if you plan on visiting both parks. The history section on Yosemity was very good, but the hiking trail inforamtion is better presented in other books."
2,An adventure that you aren't sure how it will end...,"This book is based on a 1995 ferry accident that happened in Malaysia. By interjecting the main character, Emily, an American living in Malaysia on board, we get to see what it was like for the lucky ones- those who could swim. Emily, angry at her parents for bringing her around the world while they try to heal the sick children of third world countries, decides to go visit her uncle, who is visiting a nearby island. She never suspects the ferry ride won't make it to the other shore. The book will disgust you at times, thinking of all the time wasted to get to people like Elizabeth, or how people act in the face of living or dying. You can't be so sure with this one how the story will end."
5,no title,"A terribly bittersweet, hauntingly powerful novel about Roy Calvert, first seen in ""Time of Hope"". A manic-depressive, I think. Perhaps it was not so recognized in the 30's and early 40's when this takes place. A very memorable and sensitive portrait of the love and friendship that can exist between two heterosexual men, as it delicately portrays the compassion and caring they come to share, Roy, and Lewis Eliot, the narrator. Melancholic and sad, yet a wonderful book. Just as striking as two others, ""Time of Hope"" and ""The Conscience of the Rich"", but even more poignant. The last line could not be more perfect. Snow is a master of the human psyche and condition."
2,Overrated,"There are a few great stories in here, but the rest are quite mediocre, and I was surprised to find this after all the rave reviews here! Only worth it to read one or two stories - the first one and the last one in particular - and then skip the rest."
5,HOT!,"This is the best book of bisexual erotica I've found yet! Creative stories that acually HAVE a storyline, great sex scenes (with a minuimum of anal sex, one of my main complaints about the Best Bisexual books) and a lot of fun!"
2,Not very sexy...,"I purchased this book for my girlfriend for Christmas (we are a bisexual couple) and I was very excited since there is so little bisexual erotica or literature available. Well let's just say, we were quickly disappointed when we started reading it. We keep reading in the hope that one of the stories would be worth our while. I found most of them rather disturbing. There were several really just plain gross stories. I wouldn't even call many of them 'bisexual.' It was more like a collection of stories about gay people who either 'strayed' or cheated with someone of the opposite sex. There are several stories that mention rape, having sex in back rooms or porn theaters, or with hookers. If you want a gritty read, this could be the choice for you but if you're looking to read about steamy sex maybe you should look elsewhere."
2,Ho Hum,"Boring. Better bi-sexual erotica on the internet. Nothing for the bi-curious woman. It was an easy, fast read and if you like the short story format then this might appeal to you. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,Hot Stuff,If you buy any erotic book make this the one. Includes the most well-written stories out of any erotic anthology I've ever read. You need this book in your collection.
2,Coffin to Heaven,"I bought this book for a class I had to take for my degree ""Drugs in Society."" The assignment was to find a book and do a book report. This book was what I chose, I'm not sure why though. It is a pretty dry read. Based on the subtitle though that would be a given for any normal person. It served its purpose and I got a 92 on the paper but I would never recommend it for anything above that of doing assignments with."
1,A terrible CD,This Cd wasn't any good. It shows that Bruce needs to stick with acting. Especially his bad version of crazy mixed up world. It's a waste of your money to buy this.
3,Fair Quaility for the money,"Pros;Nice big pot, Great for soups or Corned beef and cabbage.Cons;Not heavy enough to cook chili or stewsOverall;Good pot for the price as long as you're not making Thick stews or chili."
2,Please consider !!,"I gave only green veggie and this product to my baby sulcatas(5 of them) and the result is they all have pyramid shell. I believe that the effect is delay. You wont see the different just 2 weeks after you feed them with this product, however i dont believe that green veggie would caused pyramiding effect. So, i blame this product instead of green veggie, do research before buying. : )"
2,too high a heel,"Comfortable fit, but the shoe does start to hurt the ankle after a bit, the heel is quite high. If you are used to that high of a heel, should be no problem, if not, then you should go with a smaller heel. You definately can feel the thinness of the heel when walking. I am 5'8 and rarely wear this pair of heels."
5,I bought this same pair in black at Nordstrom recently,"I bought this same pair in black at Nordstrom recently for over $90 and they are still carrying them, I haven't received my brown croc pair yet but I have no doubt they will be perfect since I already have them and they are such great quality, comfortable from the beginning and such a classic style, can wear w/ dress pants, jeans, or skirts and dresses...Nothing cheap about them and to get them at this price is a total steal!!! I am contemplating buying another pair even before I get this pair because I have no doubt in my mind they are amazing and could sell out in a minute then I will kick myself!!"
5,I love these shoes,"These shoes are so classic, but very sexy. I never fail to get compliments when wearing them. They run slightly small, but break in easily."
5,cute AND comfortable heels!,"Love these shoes! I bought them for a wedding and they treated me so well! Not only are they completely adorable and I got tons of compliments on them, but they were SO COMFORTABLE! I couldn't believe it. My feet lasted through standing, walking, and dancing at the wedding, and even kept up with the after-party! Now I just hope they stay in style for awhile so I can keep wearing them..."
4,a pair to match every outfit,"So far I have 3 pairs of these stunning Enzo peep-toe shoes. They are gorgeous and excellent quality leather, with a 3-1/2"" heel. Please note that they do run a 1/2 size bigger than normal (I wear an 8-1/2 shoe, so I order these in an 8). They've given me blisters on my heels the first couple times wearing them, but once they're broken in, they are quite comfortable compared to other pumps I own. Like another reviewer said, these pumps just don't disappoint."
5,Love my shoes,"I've ordered several pair of this shoe from Amazon, the style is classic and never ages. Amazon shipped them to me within two days of ordering. Love my shoes. Thanks, Amazon!"
2,"Good concept, flawed execution","In this confusing, and verbose story, the basic idea (that this world is a shadow of another greater world) is good, the basic story line (a warrior who has to hide knowledge from himself to save the world) is good. The execution is mediocre at best. The story is deliberately confusing, and often meanders into laughably bad explanations of what's going on in the greater world. This type of story has been done better."
1,stay away from this book,"i do not recommend this book. i purchased this book in hopes of getting some information about my dreams, but i was extremley disappointed. her rambling on about her dreams did not help me with mine. my suggestion to others, look for another dream interpretation book."
1,I am glad you are out of stock!,"This book is not only very misinformed, but also incredibly dangerous. Morrison has failed to mention any form of Humanism in her dream symbols- I doubt if she has received any dreamwork or psychological training whatsoever. Take the example of a dream about gallows. As a dream healer, I would be interested in finding out the client's associations of gallows, and would link that more to do with cutting off or severing unwanted ties, or of having them cut off by someone else. It may have something to do with anger. I would not advise the client that they are ""sick"" and in ""serious need of psychological help"" [sic]. Every time I have a client or someone asking for advice on getting a good dream book, I always make a point of telling them not to get this one- it is the worst example of dream explanations I have ever had the displeasure of reading, and I am gald you are out of stock- TAKE IT OUT OF PRINT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE!"
1,Total mis-information; complete subject ignorance!,"After reading this book I was completely insulted and horrified that it could even make it to print! As a real-life witch, I am totally offended by the book's comments and feel that the author has absolutely NO real knowledge of Witches, Witchcraft or any Goddess religion. This book is completely mis-leading AND dangerous! Also, as someone who has done extensive study on Dreamtime Interpretations, I find this book very mis-leading and dangerous as well. This book is full of mis-truths and lies. Please do not take any of this book seriously! Warn those you care about not to read it!"
5,Excellent approach to figure painting and drawing,"Andrew's seeks to simplify the drawn and painted image, while emphasizing gestures,light,color and value. The effect is unique and captivating."
4,Step outside the box,"My watercolor teacher recommended this to the class. This is an excellent book for someone wanting to understand how to bring out the human figure through shading and playing with lights and darks. It takes you out of your comfort zone. It stretches you by using atypical colors for skin tones like blues, purples, and green. Sounds odd but it is amazing.I think this book was beyond my abilities but would be wonderful for a more advanced student."
1,Useless,Not only was there no sound reduction but I could not get these to form a seal and they kept falling out of my ears. I have small ear canals and maybe that is the problem but other wise I found this product useless and don't understand how they can sell it.
4,Nice book,The explanation is very clear for a teacher to understand how a course is developed. Good for people who are going to teach a language.
5,This Song Rocks!,"The first time I heard this song, I was instantly drawn to it! Kelis' ""Caught Out There"" tells the all-too familiar tale of love gone bad because of cheating. Kelis gets out all of the frustrated feelings that both women and men have felt when their boyfriend or girlfriend has cheated when she screams ""I hate you so much right now!""""Caught Out There"" is a really catchy song that you find yourself singing along to by the second chorus. It was also produced by a then-unknown producing duo named The Neptunes. Their beats and Kelis' voice really bring the song together.With all of the anger and attitude that's in the song aside, ""Caught Out There"" is a really great song! You won't be disappointed with this one!"
5,"Very Original , And Catchy Song!","I Love The Song (Caught Out There) It's Addictive , And You Can Relate To It , If You Like All Saints , TLC , Pink Or Foxy Brown Then This is a must have."
3,Golf my Way,"This is an outstanding book for beginners! It is explained in basic language and with great illustrationsHave bought extra copies to give friends, even though it is technically slightly out of date"
3,Golf My Way: Jack Nicklaus,"The first part of the book is definately outdated. It is a good read and you do get some insight into the greaest golfer of all time, but there are a lot better instructional books available."
3,Interesting book but you should just go play golf,Got this book cause its Nicklaus. If you are serious about being a golfer you will get something from this book. For the most part its just gonna mess with your head. The best thing you can do is just go play golf.
4,Good read but a little bit dated...,"I do rate this book. Its simple and practical and gives good insight into Jacks thought process and approach to golf shots. Given that it was first written in the 70s, it is a little bit dated but the more recently added section does give more insight into the mental aspects of golf. As ever Jack is direct, honest & assertive on his golf beliefs. Its simpler than Hogan's book which can be daunting for a beginner."
4,"very interesting, lots of good info","I enjoyed this book and found a lot of helpful information and interesting history. Nicklaus was just a little before my golfing ""time"" so I know who is but not a lot about him. The book talks a lot about his career history - that was great. The instruction information is also very good an easy to understand. He gets bogged down and repeats himself sometimes. Still worth the read for any golfer."
3,Some really rare gems,"I am planning to buy this just because it has ""You + Me = Love"" by the Undisputed Truth. The reviewer who dismissed this collection because it doesn't have a lot of the things we've heard on the radio ad nauseum is missing out on some solid funk. This is definitely worth a spin."
3,?No Ohio Players? No Kool& The Gang? Brick? Brothers Johnson?.... . .,everybody who loves funk already has the Funkadelic
3,Get an iPod nano for free instead!,"Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site: ilikethis.info/ipod-nano"
5,Cowboys Reebok Men's Team Classic Fleece Hood,"Great price, quick transaction, fast delivery. Very pleased, I would do business with them again."
5,Not your usual travel guide,"Having Sherif Yenen's book at hand is like having access to a first rate tourist guide whenever desired. The book is not your run of the mill guidebook but is, rather, an extensive treatment of Turkish culture and history which is worth reading even by those not contemplating a trip. These sections are followed by discussions of the ""sights"" in the various parts of the country. The book is embellished by splendid photographs many of which were taken by the author. All in all a Turkish Delight."
5,Must Read for Anyone interested in Turkey,"My husband and I found this book invaluable preparing for and during our recent trip to Turkey. The historical and cultural perspective provided by this book increased our enjoyment of this extraordinary country. The author's detailed overview of Turkey, past and present, gives the reader first hand knowledge that would be difficult to obtain elsewhere. The book includes many special discoveries (eg.small towns off the beaten track but near often over crowded tourist destinations to capture the essence of the warm and welcoming people). In addition, Serif Yenen is a highly regarded guide of his country (for 18 years), leads an organiztion of 1100 licensed guides, and writes a weekly column for a Turkish newspaper. I also recommend the CD - it's very useful and easy to use."
3,Not a regular Guide Book,"as i'm turkish i learned new thing about my country and my culture. i mean its not regular guide book to get information about bars and clubs or classical tradions of Turkey .. You can discover ANOTOLIAN culture, ISTANBUL, golden horn, blue mosque. He shouldn't forget the Sounth east foraxample Mardin, Hasankeyf, Mezopotamia.. The author should more mention about the history. He cut it sharply after ottomants. I disappointed in the period of Modern Turkish Times ( Mustafa Kemal, ATATURK) because he cut and concluded it fastly.."
2,"some like it, more love Marty Bergen","It's far from ""Complete Book on Hand Evaluation"". Mike Lawrence knows how to bridge, but his writing style sucks. This book introduces some modern concepts like ""shell points"", but also you'll find the Splinter. I think the Splinter bidding convention was appended to thicken the book. Don't put your money on Complete Book..., buy Marty Bergen's Points Schmoints."
5,Great Book Excellent Topic,Maria Etter is a very intersting lady. Her life was very interesting and I learned a lot by studying her life.
1,Pass the Prozac,"This has to be one of the most depressing, dismal ""novels"" I have ever read, and I have a graduate degree in English. I thought it would be interesting since I play the accordion, but it wasn't. I, like other reviewers, struggled to finish this book. I have never read a book so filled with characters who are the scum of the earth. I get enough of that watching the local news here in Atlanta. If you're thinking about buying ""Accordion Crimes,"" don't waste your money or your time.P.S. The correct spelling is accordion, not accordian!"
2,A too well written disturbing book,"This book is too depressing to read. Thank God not one of the people who are in need, that I have worked with over the years, have acted like the horrible people in this book. It makes me feel depressed and hopeless after reading it. The author is an amazing story teller who I must avoid in the future. She is much too vivid for me."
2,Start To Finish Took One Year!,"I COULD put this book down. And did, often. While I savored sentences and paragraphs, the chapters seemed endless, aimless, often gruesome enough to make me turn away. Too many lives, journeys, details breaking into separate pieces in one book. I have great faith that her next book will be a return to excellence."
4,"Good writing, but racially prejudiced","I read the Shipping News. I thought it was great, and that it should be made into a movie. I was disappointed to hear that Kevin Spacey was tipped to be Quoyle. The image I had of him was more like Drew Carey - a sorry oafish kind of guy (not really comical, though). Anyway, I was happy when I found Accordion Crimes, and bought it straight away. It is well written and complex, in plot and detail. However, I have only read about half, so the following opinion may change. I have just this to say at the moment - WHAT IS THIS WOMAN'S PROBLEM WITH THE IRISH? If the subjects of this acrimony were African-American or Jewish the book would never have made it to print! Aside from this, she seems to have missed the fact that Celtic music is strongly accordion based. What trauma have the Irish caused Ms Proulx?"
2,No title,"Lord, what an unsatisfying book! All the way through to the ending. About immigrants, all kinds, ages, and this green accordion made by the first immigrant in the book, an Italian. Later an Hispanic puts $14,000 in it, and not til at least 50 years later does that issue get resolved. I kept waiting and waiting, like I was on some kind of tenterhook. And so much trivia, list upon list, filling paragraphs; ridiculous similes, people I had no interest in either. Just lives lived and lost. So rather factual and droning in tone. Major disappointment. And yet it had rave reviews on the back cover. Far too much info on accordions, their types, history, etc. I don't care. Maybe if you have a big interest in them, you might."
3,A different way to look at the triumph of human spirit !,"Salty, ethnic, real, are words I read in reviews of this book. They are all true. Superbly researched, as is usual with all of Annie Proulx's work. This is a book of short stories, with interesting ethnic characters at different periods in the end of the nineteenth and twentieth century.This is largely a sad tale of the futility of life, or if you wish you may call it a book on the persistence of the human spirit despite of the futility of life and therefor its triumph. You will have to look hard and reflect quiet a bit till you get to the triumph bit thoughAnnie Proulx is wonderful storyteller, she sets the scene beautifully through her excellent research of the background material. Her characters are very skillfully developed, and there is always an element of suspense, even when she does tell us up front what eventually happens. Best of all is Annie Proulx's use of language and words to weave vivid images of people, places and situations."
2,A tedious read- I finally gave up.,"Like ""berniebo2"" (last critic), I have enjoyed Proulx's past writing immensely. The Shipping News and Postcards were wonderful novels. The premise of this book has promise- tracing an accordian's journeys through time and owners, giving the reader a sense of the many cultures within American life. But the bottom line was that the book was too wordy, too long, and not very compelling. I couldn't identify well with the characters even in the abstract. If you want to be exposed to a story with this same fascinating theme- only much cleaner- see ""The Red Violin"" in VHS or DVD. It, too, traces the path of a musical instrument (a violin)though many owners and countries. However, the pace is much swifter and the characters are more engaging."
1,Laborious,"This book was so disjointed that I quit halfway through. The concept of the accordion through time was interesting, but I cared nothing about any of the characters except the original owner of the accordion. I had to make myself read the book, so I quit. The Shipping News was much better."
1,Boring and frustrating,"The premise sounded interesting: following the accordian through a series of owners from all walks of life. But the characters were extremely uninteresting. I didn't mind the book's darkness, as other reviewers did, because I really didn't care at all what happened to any of the characters, tragic or otherwise. But it's not enough that it's boring... Proulx' writing style is so frustrating. One paragraph might be a single sentence, going on and on, through myriad descriptive phrases, punctuated with endless commas, so that, by the end of the sentence, you have completely lost the point. Then the next paragaph is a collection of short thoughts. Single phrases. Broken into sentences. I was so distracted by the run-on sentences and the dramatic stylistic shifts, that what little empathy I might have mustered for any of the characters was totally lost."
2,nancy's review,"I have enjoyed a lot of Annie Proulx books, but this one is my least favorite. The people who own and love accordians all come across as losers. This made me depressed."
1,Dreary and misanthropic,"I have to admit that after reading this book I asked myself what might have happened to E. Annie Proulx between the time she wrote the wonderful, life-affirming ""Shipping News"" and the relentlessly dark ""Accordian Crimes."" Did some disaster befall her to change her view of the world and humanity?In ""Shipping News"" we met all kinds of people, both good and bad--some good but full of human foibles, some not so likable. They hurt each other; they make true human connections. Not so for most of the characters in ""Accordian Crimes.""Though of course to some extent the American Dream is a myth, I believe the true story of American immigration is much more complex and varied than the ugly tale that Proulx tells in ""Accordian Crimes.""I just read the positive review of Proulx's new book of short stories in The Washington Post. I think I'll wait and get the book out of the library rather than spend my money until I find out which Annie Proulx wrote this one."
1,How Much Tragedy Can I Cram In,"Every kind of tragedy is crammed into this novel. Written for movie rights maybe? The concept of following an accordian could have been interesting. The one star I gave it was for the descriptions of accordians - a subject with which I was unfamiliar. If you want to know about accordians, go to an encyclopedia; don't bother with this book."
2,"Disappointing, pointless, no redeeming qualities","With great expectations, our reading group, all fans of Annie Proulx, took up Accordion Crimes. Alas, we were unanimous in our profound disappointmen. Nowhere in the book did there appear a shred of hopefulness, a bit of redemption, any glimmer of relief from the relentless pessimism and heavyhanded grimness. The characters themselves were unlikable, for the most part, and the view of humanity in this book is worthy of the most confirmed misanthrope. None of us in the reading group could understand what the point of this whole exercise was. A waste of time."
1,scary... not in the good way either,"Some gray, murky metaphors, adjectives, etc. happen in this book, but I found the WHOLE thing completely inaffective.Let's just say it's the only book in my entire life that I returned to the bookstore AFTER I had read it, just because I didn't want it the book as a physical object in my house."
2,A monumental disappointment,"After The Shipping News, I couldn't wait to read Annie Proulx's latest. She had been able to grasp a unique Canadian culture of Newfoundland so well, I expected more of the same or better in Accordian Crimes. This is not a book, just a weak collection of depressing and unsatisfying short stories that do nothing to create empathy with the characters. Not a character here you would want to meet. The theme: the American dream unmasked is a good one. No plot, no unifying idea other than the little green accordian which moves along as each owner dies or loses it. I had to force myself to finish it. If this had been Annie Proulx's first book, no one would buy the next."
2,A long and rambling tale that loses the reader,"While the beginning of E. Annie Proulx's novel, Accordion Crimes starts off well, the reader is quickly lost as the accordion moves from one miserable owner to another. I truly was bored by this book, but did finish it."
2,Interminable,"I have been reading this book for months, am almost done with it, and I still don't know if I'll ever finish it, it is that uninteresting. This author writes marvelous prose and I loved ""The Shipping News"", however, I have been totally unable to develop an interest in the characters, the accordion, the crimes; the total absence of humanity in any of these characters is remarkable. Should one become slightly interested in the fate of one of these families, it is too late, as they will be devastated by a weird calamity and that will be the end of them. This book was eminently putdownable."
3,heavy,"This one's heavy. We see the 20th century through the eyes of a series of underpriviledged, bigoted people who each come in contact with a green accordian (this is nothing like The Red Violin). Nobody lives well or dies happy. The structure of the book gives us at most a couple chapters on a character, so we don't end up caring very much about anybody. Yet Proulx's style is engaging, and early in the book she tosses a plot element into the mix that keeps you going to the satisfying end (which was good enough to turn a 2-star rating into a 3-star)."
1,I dare you to finish this book,"This is the most bloody Annie Proulx novel yet, with very little redeeming social value. After the fourth ""crime"" which only took me through about one-third of the book, I just gave up, not being attracted by any continuity which were present in Annie Proulx's other novels, ""Shipping News,"" and ""Postcards."" In the case of ""Accordion Crimes"" the attempt at continuity is provided by the accordion of the title, which witnesses the various crimes of murder, lynching, adultery, drug trafficing, etc. In ""Postcards,"" despite the gimmick of the hand printed or typewritten postcards which precede many chapters, it is the vitality of Loyal Blood, the main character, which compels us onward and maintains our interest. Similarly, Quoyle, in ""Shipping News"" compels us with his dogged and tender nature. The accordion of the present novel just does not have such a compelling personality. However, if you like a challenge, I dare you to finish this book."
2,Crimes Against Fiction,"I have read everything that Annie Proulx has written. At her best, as in ""The Shipping News"" and ""Close Range: Wyoming Stories,"" Proulx is unlike any author I've encoutered; her characters and landscapes burn with rage, passion, hardship and survival. However, in ""Accordion Crimes,"" Proulx violates her readers' trust with implausible stories of gratuitous gore. The pretext for her lurid vignettes is a green accordion that passes to various immigrant families, whose members are dismembered in gruesome detail. While these stories may entertain a few execrable sociopaths, Proulx risks the alienation of her enthusiasts. One can only hope that this work is the aberrant creation of an otherwise unique and remarkable talent."
4,amazing singer,Even better than I thought it would be. I heard her sing on a movie sound track and then bought a CD. An excellent voice..vastly underrated.
4,Copper Washers,This is a nice assortment of washers for the price. It's too bad that shipping costs doubles the price.
4,Fascinating Book,This is an excellent book! I have been introduces to these ideas for healing in the past but never had seen it in print before. Dr. Fish is working with light and truth and we should pay attention to those things that can make our lives better. The book is a very easy read and goes by quickly. I enjoyed all of it. Christ is the one true healer and we all have access to that healing.A friend told me about this book and I'm so glad that she did!
4,bad servce,The dealer has sent the item to a wrong shipping address.Was very hard to comunicate. Did not pay attention to what I asked even on the replacement shipping.
2,The quality of this book is appalling,"As far as regards content, this is a fine book. It's a textbook, and it does that job.I am commenting on the horrible cheap production: the publisher has effectively made a photocopy of the hardcover, and is selling it for $100. The cover is flimsy paper, scuffs and bends easily; the text on the pages is askew; and the contrast in the charts and shading is awful."
4,Good operations research book,Very good operations research book. The practical examples that ilustrate each concept are very useful and make this book quite useful and more esier to apply to real-life cases.
2,Not as helpful as I hoped.,"This book delivers many promises (and helps to re-kindle hope in a ""cure""), but is overly simplistic. I found it difficult to escape my insomnia even with following the guidelines in this book. It is better than some books on this subject, but not the one that I would recommend. The book called ""Say Goodnight to Insomnia"" helped me the most."
4,"FUNNY TITLE, SERIOUS INFORMATION",Good information. Book gives a lot of tips on getting a handle on insomnia. I dip into the text when I can't sleep.
4,BOOK REVIEW,I read Desperately Seeking Snoozin over the Christmas holidays after just experiencing three long grueling months of not being able to sleep. I have read a lot of books on sleeping in the past and this is the first book I have read that actually helped. I have tried everything that is suggested in the book and it has really made a world of difference. I go to bed later than I was going to bed before and I get up at the same time each and every morning. I have a hot bath before bed and I try the relaxation exercises in bed. The book really changed my life. My sleeping difficulties were hindering my performance at work and it was affecting my marriage. I have also started exercising on a regular basis which has a made a tremendous difference in my life. I am in the process of recommending this book to all my friends and colleagues who are also experiencing sleep problems.
2,Poorly written but helpful.,Unbelievably poorly written but does have some good ideas.In the appendix there is a comment from someone who claims they're a literary agent and that the writing is superb. I would surmise the person is not a successful literary agent.
4,Very Practical and Simple,"A very good, practical book. Although at first blush, the advise almost seems overly simple, it works. I guess, like lots of good ideas and advise, sometimes simple is the best. I've suffered from insomnia on and off for about 25 years and I've tried most everything, including sleeping pills. I've been doing this program now for about 3 weeks and it has definitely improved my sleep. In those 3 weeks, I've had maybe 3 bad nights, and even those nights weren't as bad as what I used to consider bad. In addition to sleeping better, I have an extra hour or two at the end of the day because of how this program works. Over the years, I've read quite a bit about insomnia and sleep, like all of us insomniacs probably have, but I would say this book contains the most practical advise. While this program may not cure everyone's insomnia, at a minimum, it will certainly help everyone who has insomnia that is not related to some type of underlying physical condition."
1,Unfortunate that we keep reading a guy who was wrong,"It will be very unpopular to suggest the following, but please consider that Mr. Lindsey has been wrong too many times to still be credible. This book suggests the code for understanding prophecy -- what if it's not codes, but more sounder hermaneutics? If readers like the Revelation and prohecy interpretation, this may be interesting in your collection: ""Postmillennialism: An Eschatology of Hope"" by Keith Mathison"
1,Stupid,only god knows our fate and that's the way it should be!i only rated it 1 star because i can't put none
5,Better than Left Behind,"Here's the Left Behind message in one book without the fictional characters and drawn out story line. Same insight, same general interpretation of the Book of Revelation. This book answers any last minute questions the believer has. It's hard to believe it was written in 1997; Hal has the year 2001 events right on que!"
3,"Not Hal's best work, but worth reading.","Could have also been named ""Apocalypse Now.""I like Hals work, and he uses scripture to backall of his opinions, but this book swung apretty heavy hammer on the terrible condition ofthe world.Still, with a topic like the book of Revelation, itis difficult not to be morbid. As he points out;the ending is good if you are a believer."
4,"Good for those, like myself, recently saved","Althogh it is probably not for everyone, I did get alot out of it. For those seeking some potential clarification of Revelations it would be money well spent. I've heard Revelations is probably the most misunderstood book in the Bible. I think Lindsey offers plausible insight into the symbolism Revelations contains. If you desire this too go for this book. I don't have to accept all of an author's viewpoints in order to get alot out of any book (excluding the Bible, of course.) It was especially helpful for me in that I'm an American living in France without a church or other Christians to turn to for guidance. If someone knows of a better book on this suject I would read it and compare them. Merci, James Johnson"
2,Compelling yet difficult to read through because of poor edi,A compelling view of bible prophecy that was difficult to read through because of extremely poor editing that increasingly distracted from the book's content. Don't publishers proofread anymore?
5,Magnificent,"I heard these folks at the Topsfield Fair in Massachusetts. I bought 2 of their CDs based on what I heard. My only regret is that I didn't buy them all. They are extremely hard to find. If you love simple, passionate, folk music do not pass on any of this groups offerings."
2,Marketing Gimmick?,"The flow of the music is very good, but it's not extordinarily different from other music in this genre. What I deeply dislike is the use of sacred Reiki symbols as a marketing gimmick. I expect that future CD's will use other Reiki symbols in the same way. It's for this reason that I will not use it during my sessions. Sorry."
5,What A Beautiful CD!,"I just love using this CD when meditating or giving a Reiki treatment. I highly recommend it!All the comments about the use of the Reiki symbol is saddening. Sacred does not mean secret!The power of Cho Ku Rei flows throughout the music and what is displayed on the cover neither adds nor distracts from the beauty of this composition unless your intention is judgment. The symbol itself is of no consequence, it is how it is held in the mind and each of us is responsible for how we perceive it."
3,"This spray had a mild scent, but unfortunately ...","This spray had a mild scent, but unfortunately I didn't like the scent at all. I usually like lavender, but I didn't care for this one, so I probably wouldn't buy it again. I might, however, buy it in another scent. The bottle was very attractive."
5,"Before I tried the spray, I was very ...","Before I tried the spray, I was very dubious about the benefits, expecting that it would be like any perfumed air spray. I was wrong! It has a wonderful, fresh scent that makes your pillow really pleasant to put your head down on. I can't say that it really made a big difference in my sleeping, but it certainly enhanced the rather ordinary experience of retiring for the night, and I'd really recommend it to friends and family."
3,The product has a nice fragrance -- it's ...,"The product has a nice fragrance -- it's a lighter scent than I'd expected. I couldn't really tell if it helped me to sleep better or not, but it was nice to smell as I lie there before drifting off."
4,This room spray is wonderful! When I first ...,"This room spray is wonderful! When I first smelled it, I wasn't convinced, but when I use it at night, I can't help but relax! The scent is milder than others I've tried, so it isn't overpowering. The spray itself seems lighter and doesn't trigger allergy attacks, the way some have for me."
2,But what about the recording?,"No question that this is a five-star collection of songs from a great band. I was truly disappointed in the quality of the mastering, though, which sounded like the old tapes I used to make by holding a cassette microphone up to our Sears hi-fi (the one with the penny taped to the tone arm). Maybe it matches the quality of the original LP, but I find it almost unlistenable. Surely the later ""best of"" cleaned up the original masters, making it a better purchase."
5,New to The Who?,"If you're interested in The Who, but don't know a lot of their early material, this is a great collection to start with. Classic early singles (""My Generation"") and some oddball subject matter (""Pictures Of Lily"") combine to make for a terrific over-all view of what The 'orrible 'ho are all about. After this: Get ""Live At Leeds"" to find out about the power of The Who on stage."
5,A WONDERFUL RELEASE!!,"This Japanese mini-lp replica version of Who, Meaty Beaty Big And Bouncy, the most classic compilation album released by The Who, is simply a work of art! Very beautifully designed with all the lyrics included and with a sound quality remastered 24-BIT to perfection. Wonderful Japanese OBI strip, really a work of art!This is by far the best version of this album that is out there; great sound quality, great packaging! A must have in any CD collector's library."
4,an enviromentally friendly cat,this book is fairly good. t talks about cats and how your cat can be an evrirocat. t explains bathing and even covers a lillte bit of training like sit etc. It enourages your cat to stay inside to respect the environment and to get it to wear a belt. It does cover almost anything you will need to know about your cat and safe responsible ownership.
4,Instrumentation for the Operating Room,Its adequate to check out which instruments are in each o.r. tray. There aren't any close up pictures but I don't need them.
4,Good group game,"I got this for my four year old on sale after christmas. I was a little disappointed when we first played it because I thought she'd be learning facts about animals. But after playing it a few times we all like it (even my 1 year old watches the kids and walks from pad to pad) and its a good game to practice following directions, and that is very important for preschoolers."
2,A bit Pointless,"The floppy little mats slide on carpet. They don't stay put. The kids had a good time with the game, but it's a bit pointless. It says to step on shapes and animals, but it's not educational other than that. I was unhappy with this purchase even though I got it on sale."
4,"I like the original better, too.","I bought the original when my kids were 5 and 3, and it was a good game for them to play together for a change. The DVD game has the same concept, but is more visual; when the announcer announces the pad, the possibilities show up on the screen. All the pads are animals (no food, musical instruments, as in the original), but there is minimal animal education. Kids might learn which animals are farm animals, which are ocean animals, etc. I think there is less variation in this game than the original; after a few days play and repeat games, I can figure out (but not my kids)which pad will be the winning one. One of the best features of the original, is that it made my kids listen to the instructions. Listening skills can be replaced by visual cues in the DVD version."
5,Fun for all ages,We don't have the original so I can't speak to that. This is one of few games that both my 8-year-old and my 4-year-old like. I also like that it's a little active and gets us up off the couch
5,Terrific Book!,"An engaging mystery of the British cozy variety, wherein a vicar's wife loses her faith and becomes the object of vicious parish political maneuvering that ends in homicide. I bought this book with the intention of reading it over the coming week. In reality, I stayed up reading it most of the night that I purchased it. Highly recommended!"
1,Is he serious???,"This book is entertaining, but not very believable. Mr. Christian does not tell a very convincing story. I found the book so ridiculous that I couldn't even finish it. I am sure Mr. Christian was a very good soldier, but he is not a good storyteller. If you have ever read any books by men who told the truth about the war, you will not be able to believe a word Mr. Christian has written. He comes across as being so conceited. Save yourself the time, and go read a truthful account of the Vietnam War. This book seems nothing but a fantasy."
1,Bland and not cohesive,"Bland does not adequately connect the medieval and the modern, leaving a gap between the two periods. Further, he is clearly more adept at analyzing the medieval period as his discussion of the modern lacks the same level of critical penetration. In sum, I found Bland's book to be bland."
3,"Works, but.....","Product works as advertised and keeps your toilet bowl clean. However, it has a very noticeable, at least to me, smell of bleach. If you don't mind that I would recommend this product. But for me, the smell bothered me and I no longer use Kaboom...."
1,Doesn't fit standard system,No idea what system this is for. It doesn't fit the system. It's a big white plastic container with slots. In no way is it used with the kaboom cleaner..
5,Spamtastic,"This is a bold and imaginative cookery book. Eggers shows flair with a daring East/West fusion in her Thai influenced Spam with Mint and Brocoli: tender chunks of luncheon loaf stir-fried with fish sauce, chili, brown sugar and brocoli then topped with fresh mint. Look out too for her Spam en Croute - slab of reconstituted pork coated in a rich mushroom pate and wrapped in filo pastry. It's a triumph. That distinctive taste of the abbatoir floor you get with Spam comes through best, perhaps, in a simple yet delicious Spam Tartare - raw Spam, ground with anchovies, egg yolk, mustard, oil and Worcestershire Sauce. Mmmmmm. Heaven."
5,Great little book !,"A nice little pick-me-up; great way to start your day. Wonderful with breakfast, or to share with someone special. Positive attitude is the only way to leave the house - we could only hope for a lot less road rage !"
2,Not what I thought,Nice little thoughts book but not a real book. I thought it was an actual story or something. It is little nice thoughts on each page. Not what I had expected or really wanted but fine for what it is.
5,Believing in myself,Best daily meditation book I have found. It focuses on what makes us tick inside. It is challenging and causes me to think through behaviors and brings more understanding to human ralationships.
3,Good Message - But lot of print and big words,"This book has many great messages, but it is not written simply. There are lots of big words and confusing messages. In looking for a better life and self-esteem, I want things simply put, right to the point. Sometimes I am confused after the readings."
1,Beliveing in Myself Meditations,"I have been reading this book for about a month. Out of those 30 days, maybe 2 readings have had any significance for me."
3,Believing in Myself,"Your basic daily devotional book geared toward helping you become a more positive thinking person. I don't think it's outstanding, but anything that helps anyone become more positive is good.I did receive the item quickly and my buying experience was positive."
5,Believing in Myself,Excellent book. I purchased my first copy many years ago and purchased a second copy for a friend. She loves it.
4,Believing in Myself: Self Esteem Daily Meditations..,"Easy reading and a good book for daily reading for self esteem...Really liked it, definately a feel good book for everyone..."
2,So So for the price I paid,"I like the quality of the case and battery. Apart from these two items other items are just junk, packed to look the package big. Doesn't worth the price. I didn't returned because the return policy with the seller was not that good."
2,didn't work on my bird feeder,I liked the product but the pole that my bird feeler hangs on has a 2 prong stand that goes in the ground.This quirrel baffle only goes on a straight pole.You really need to say what kind of stand it will work on.The squirrel baffle was fine except it would not work on my stand.
1,Rip-off,"This is not a true soundtrack album, but just some music taken directly from the movie put on CD. The producers tried to hide the fact by often fading the tracks out whenever a voice or sound effect is heard. The bonus tracks seem to be played on a completely different organ and I wonder why the producers could locate unused material but not the actual recordings made for the movie. Maybe this material isn't any ""unused material"" at all, but completely different music. It's a shame Moore's interesting score is so poorly presented here."
3,"Atmospheric, Eerie Soundtrack","Many of the tracks are brief (only a few seconds in duration), and some of the score would not be missed if left off the disc, but overall, a truly worthy soundtrack to an eerie, surreal film. There are some sonic glitches (the disc sounds like it was recorded straight from the film, and not from a separate sound source), and the sound quality isn't going to win any awards, but all this somehow adds to the final result. The brief spoken-word interludes are a nice addition, too."
3,It's All About Noel - Really,"I had high hopes for this book. For the first 150 or so pages it met my expectations and occasionally exceeded them. It was pretty much downhill from there as Noel recedes into an extended explanation of the multitude of ways pretty much everyone in the world including management (which clearly they did but only because he let them), all of the lawyers including his own, Jimmy and then the Hendrix estate ripped him off. I'm sorry but I have little sympathy for Noel.An interesting book in the litany of Hendrix books but certainly not a primary read."
3,"excellent, but...","I love Dork Tower, it's my favorite comic strip HANDS DOWN. That said, and I don't want to make this review sound like a downer, but it did not continue the story of Gilly and Matt, it had too many strips that were recycled from the first three books, and ultimately felt like a bit of a let down. That said, John Kovalick still has some great strips in here but for the amount of repeated material I wish that I had gone ahead and bought books VI and VII."
4,great unless you have Vista,"I liked this game a lot, but couldnt play it on my newer computer because it causes Vista to crash and need to be reinstalled."
2,El Sucko,I was psyched to pick it up in the store while traveling. Got home... took 10 minutes to install it (damned starforce protection) and WOW!!! IT SUCKS!I could not believe what has happened to Red Storm Entertainment since they were bought. (...). UBI Soft throws its fans NOTHING. OOOOOoooo!!! They actually allowed it to be modded by the fans! Thanks guys! They did it because they KNEW it would suck out of the box.Is it patchable? Who knows... when Ubi Soft produces such crap I would not waste my time modding it.
1,"StarForce may make this game ""incompatible"" with your PC","I can not review the game play itself. Why you ask? Because the USB optical drive I HAVE to use with my laptop is not ""compatible"" with starforce copy protection. Neither are newer SATA drives and some other brands. StarForce is also technically a ""rootkit"" which not unlike the product Sony has already gotten in trouble for and by it's very nature opens your PC up to various worms and viruses.I am extremely unhappy and will probably never buy UbiSoft again. Even if they remove ""StarForce"" from their games this episode has shown what they really think of their customers."
2,Bad Install,"I bought it and was excited to begin playing. Then I realized that StarForce security wasn't going to let me do that.I uninstalled it 5 times, only to discover that it was clogging up my laptop's memory. I only survived by using system restore. If you want this game, then get it for Xbox or PS2, that way it might actually runn."
2,not very good,"i was very dissapointed, the online play, very bad. it has many flaws in it you dont have much wepons and you have to buy your weapons. with points! who ever heard of a special op ever buying his own gun its all tax payers money. the graphics thank god are ok. but graphics arent good if you enjoy playing the game. a total rent before buy."
3,It's OK,"This is continuation of a series of Tom Clancy International SWAT team style games. Your a secret international anti terrorist squad that machine guns down people on sight. Now, Lockdown is a few years old. It will work fine on almost any current computer, or even an older one fine. Graphics are good, better than the previous Rainbow game. The guns ""feel"" realistic, they kick and take a little time to aim and reload.Cons: Old. Basic gameplay. You equip with a few available guns & accy's, then walk down a path, kill, command your team, and load to the next scene. Limited areas you can go on maps. Outdated graphics, and nowhere even close to as well made of a game compared to the Half life series. If you buy this game you really won't spend much time playing it compaired to the other games available.My advice, Spend the $10 or $20 on this instead of Taco Bell drive thru."
2,One of the Lamest Rainbow Six games!,"As a huge fan of Clancy games, I mistakenly bought this one. The graphics are fairly nice, but the 'on rails' feel and constant 'trigger point' AI is frustrating. The AI is some of the worst I've ever seen in a game. Your team is SO stupid you'll want to just keep sending them back to the start point to keep them alive and out of your way. The enemy AI also becomes boring in how they always do and say the same thing over and over. I turned the game difficulty all the way up, and it's still just a 'yawn festival'. Online verses play is fun, but good luck finding anyone out there! Don't waste your $$ or time on this one!"
1,Really bad,"I agree with most of the other people that posted. This game is a straight run and gun game with no planing or strategy. Hell most of the time your team seems to be there to serve as another target for your enemy. The AI sucks badly most ""breach bang and clear"" strategies seem to fail most of the time. Also you only get one squad instead of 3, no mission planning and the weapon selections blows. They probably took out the mission planning since they want the game to be a run gun style game. I would probably given this game a higher score if they named it something other than R6 for the reason when I think of a Tom Clancy game I think of strategy, Teamwork and patience ,you don't need any of that here. Don't get me wrong its a mediocre game at best but doesn't deserve the R6 title."
1,R6 Lockdown Damaged my DVD/RW,Unfortunately - I did not have enough sense to check the ratings here at Amazon before buying this crap game (I got it from CompUSA). I tried to install it and immediately my (Dell 6000D) DVD/RW started thrashing and making odd noises. The first (of five!!) CDs installed but the second would not read - nor eject from the Dell. Long story made short - I am out $90+ to replace the drive. After many years (since 1998) of buying Red Storm/Ubisoft games - this is my last crap game from them. I STRONGLY recommend that everyone boycott Ubisoft over this terrible joke on consumers.
2,Lame,They could have put more time into development for this game. Glad I got it cheap. Even free I don't think I can recommend it
4,Good Reference,"Good resource for all. Has detailed definitions and helpful, although simplistic, examples."
4,A Great & Convenient reference book of Real Estate,"For those who want to get quick reference of Real Estate, this is an introduction book. You could fine definitions quickly, and it also contains some figures & charts to help you undersatnd special meanings of Real Estate"
2,disappointed,"I ordered this for my son expecting an army vehicle. No where in the product description did it say that this is a model vehicle, and a poorly constructed one at that. Once we got over our disappointment that the product wasn't what we thought it to be, we set about putting it together. The pieces are by far too small, it is very hard for adult hands to handle and.assemble. all the pieces are the same color, so the finished product lacks.dimension or realism. No stickers for decoration either. After about 4 hours and only having a few pieces of the hood assembled, we made the decision to throw away and go buy another, more kid friendly model. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this product unless it is your exact desire."
3,Pretty but will destroy your hair,"This is a pretty little chain, and it's surprisingly sturdy for the price.Unfortunately the gaps between the links are just wide enough to trap hair at the nape of your neck, and if you're not careful, you'll end up with giant wads of torn-out hair stuck in the chain."
3,final appearance of Bill Malloy,"In an attempt to settle the controversy surrounding the manslaughter case, Bill Malloy sets up a meeting for himself, Roger Collins, Burke Devlin, and Sam Evans.Burke investigates Malloy's subsequent mysterious disappearance. Elizabeth Collins Stoddard tells Victoria Winters some of Collinwood's legends about Widows' Hill. The tape concludes as Carolyn and Vickie make a shocking discovery there..."
1,I would rate it with zero stars if I could.,"This watch is an expensive piece of crap. I purchased it in June. The band came apart a couple of months after it arrived. It began to stop or loose time in November. I replaced the battery in mid-December and it still would not keep the correct time. I tried to cover all of the possible issues before contacting Amazon/Chelsea Watch, but when I finally decided that the watch WAS defective and that it should be replaced my request was refused. The watch was not even 6 months old when I began having problems with it. To top it all off the digital portion is so small it is difficult to read--it isn't as pictured."
1,Junk,The watch worked for two weeks and then quit. I thought maybe it was the battery so I had it replaced. It still didn't work. The seller refused to exchange it or give me a refund.
4,Great watch,"This is a good looking watch that works very well. It doesn't all the features that I never use, so it is easy to operate and adjust. I travel some and the dual time feature makes it easy to keep track of time changes. I would rather have a matching metal band than the plactic one that came with the watch, but I have had it for a year and not gotten around to changing it."
1,LLLLLL,NOT HAPPY AT ALL.. NOTHING WRONG WITH THE WATCH I GOT IT JUST NOT THE ONE IN THE PIC THE ONE THEY SENT ME WAS YELLOW LOOKING ONE
3,Good beginning,"This is the first album of this band and I think is good for be the begining. Is a mix of rock & pop and is addicted. The ballad 'Ya nada queda' is great and powerful and reminds me a relationship with a girlfriend.Is just the beginning for a great band, maybe..."
3,Kudai... Chilean Music,"This CD is not really good. But you can enjoy it easily after a while. The best track is ""Ya Nada Queda"". But most of the other tracks are dump-material."
1,Don`t be fooled .....chilean music is no that bad....,"during the past year, the chilean music scene has been flooded whit teen groups like this, absolutely manufactured teen pop just like the 1999 worlwide teen pop revolution..kudai is another prove of how a good producer can take a bunch of cute little boys and girls whit NO TALENT AT ALL...and turn them into a media and comercial success..but, don`t be fooled this won`t last .... so don`t expect to see kudai in 2 years more.."
5,"If you love Shawn Colvin, you'll love love love this record.","Not only was this one of the great records of '95, it's one of the great unheralded records of the decade. I'm not kidding. Fans of Colvin will totally appreciate this singer/songwriter. Ignore those reviews. It's a brilliant record."
5,Fantastic!,"An acquaintance of mine bought this CD for me after we spent hours talking about our favorite songs and artists. Not a day goes by that I don't listen to at least one song. Her lyrics are honest and bottom line. Her voice is great (though I'm not sure I would want to hear her sing something that requires a big octave range), the band is great. Buy it. You'll enjoy it."
4,Only half of The Story,"After listening to the entire CD, I have to agree with Amazon.com's review of Plumb. Jonatha Brooke, a great songwriter, doesn't have the vocal range required of a soloist. This is most evident in songs such as Full-Fledged Strangers, Paris & Is This All? (appropriately named), where Brooke's voice is somewhat mediocre, even though the performances itself were good. Overall, this is a good CD comprised of well-written songs, performed by a very talented band. The only thing missing, as Paul Harvey would say, is ""the rest of The Story"" (former The Story's co-lead vocalist Jennifer Kimball)."
3,Not As Good As CD's With THE STORY,"I bought this CD because I loved the two albums she did with The Story. ""Plumb"" was pleasant but didn't have the vitality of ""Angel In The House"" or ""Grace In Gravity."" It lacks the chemistry she has with Jennifer Kimball."
4,Plumb Special!,"We'd never heard of Jonatha Brooke when we saw her open for Natalie Merchant in England several years ago. My only complaint about this great CD is that it doesn't come close to capturing the amazing energy and vitality JB displays in live shows. If you get a chance, catch one of her gigs."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"The phone is sleek and beautiful to look at and has all the options I needed. However, the battery life is pathetic. 12 mins after taking the handset off the cradle it beeps for low battery. One battery like this I could excuse, but it happened with all 3 of my hand sets. VTech needs to improve battery life as none of my batteries held a charge. Pathetic."
3,I liked it while the battery was good.,I like this phone a lot. It's very sleek and flat but as far back as I can remember (I've had it for a couple of years) the battery has been terrible. I can't talk on it for more than 30 minutes without it going dead. I had been trying to refrain from buying a new battery since it's $24.95 so I finally just bought a new phone instead of paying for a battery.
3,Amazing phone with some minor issues.,"There are very few things that I can say badly about this phone.The phone looks amazing, the sound quality is excellent, it's very user-friendly, and intuitive.This phone was purchased last Christmas as a gift. Since then, the phone has performed wonderfully up until very recently. The speaker is losing connection inside the phone to the board, and it crackles. When using the speakerphone, it crackles constantly. Often, when dialing out, the speaker freaks out and you can barely hear the party on the other end. I'm not sure if this is overall workmanship, internally, on the phone. It may just be a fluke with my phone.Either way, this phone has been my baby and it's honestly the best phone I've probably ever had. If it worked consistently it probably still would be at the top of my list."
5,Great phone,"The phone is very clear and allows me to roam farther from the base than my old Uniden. To those that are complaining about there not being a speaker phone, all I can say is don't rate the phone as being bad. Try reading the specifications next time, because they never claimed it was one."
1,"Worst battery life, no features","We replaced a phone with this one almost two years ago. We chose it because it was cordless, had speakerphone and DECT 6.0 (the only one that did at our local Staples at the time).It was falling apart within months.The battery life is pitiful. The battery cover doesn't stay on. The phone often slips out of its cradle or the whole thing will topple over. There aren't very many features and they are hard to access. I regret this purchase."
1,Poor Battery lilfe - poor customer support - stay away,The phone looks awesome - and that is where is stops.Had this phone fro about 2 yrs - and after 2-3 months of having it - it started malfunctioning1. The phone would drain the battery - replaced battery 4 times and on my 5th one2. The phone disconnects itself3. Initially the sound quality was good - now it sucks - and people at times can't hear meWORSE OF ALL - and this is how I judge a company - EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT ! The company knew that this phone had issues since the very beginning but they don't acknowledge and don't want to do anything about it. 30 to 40 minutes to get to speak with a representative. Stay away.I will NEVER purchase a vtech phone.
2,worked well at first,The phone worked well at first. I was very pleased and bought 2 more phones for family. But after about 1 year use it fell apart. The battery is useless and only lasts a year. After that you need to buy another battery which is very hard to find. I had to order it online. Recently the phone has been dropping calls and I must replace the phone. As for the other 2 phones I purchased I am waiting to see. They aren't a year old yet. Good phone for one year.
1,Battery is wonky,"This phone has a bug. Sometimes when you answer it the battery drops to zero and you can't talk to whoever has just called you! And you can't call them right back because you have to wait for the handset to charge again. Also, you can't take the phone off it's cradle for any amount of time, like if you're expecting a call, without the battery draining within about 5 or 10 minutes. Customer support is non-existent.Sound is just fine though."
1,Wish I would have checked here first,"I wish I would have read these reviews before buying this phone. After charging the phone overnight, and talking on it for only five minutes the battery starts beeping for low battery. Wish I would have kept my receipt so I could take it back. I think I'll just have to buy a new phone."
2,VTech 6032 DECT 6.0 Cordless,The phone is great as far as sound quality. However the battery life is terrible. Also there is no battery life indicator to let you know when its low. You can see a battery icon only while the phone is on the charger. Even then it doesn't indicate full or low. Only that its charging. It dies after being off the charger for only 12 hrs. Talk time is like 2.5 hrs. I just returned it. Uniden is much better for battery life.
3,updated review on this,"Well, it's just like the typical love story. At first everything was perfect, but now, a year and a half in, the phone is becoming difficult.This phone cannot hold a charge to save it's life. I'll leave it on the base for two or three DAYS and then after a 45 minute phone call, the thing is dead. That's if I'm lucky enough to finish the phone call without the phone just turning off. That's right, off. No warning, no annoying beeps, nothing. Then when I put it back on the base, it either can't reconnect or the screen just stays blank until I shake it a couple of times.When it works, it's the best, but it doesn't work consistently.It's so cute too. Ah, the story of my life."
2,Just plain sucks,I just bought this cordless like a month ago and all of a sudden it stops ringing on incoming calls.... for no reason. I called the customer service line and they told me that there might be some sort of electrical device thats interfering with the phone. The only thing I have close to it is an ordinary fan 3 feet away. I know the motor in the fan outputs low level static and EMP but I mean come on. A FAN?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I still refuse to believe that thats the problem. Please i hope not....
4,Digital Answering machine from VTech,"I purchased this phone/answering service essentially for the voicemail since my old answering machine was no longer reliable. So far, I am very pleased with the quality of the voicemail function. The sound of the recordings is clear, it is reliable, and easy to use. The audio on the phone itself is not quite as stellar but is good enough for my purposes ( I generally use my other phone for longer conversations)."
4,Very nice phone,I really like this phone. The phone it self is very slim and looks very updated. It does have a low battery signal on it unlike previous reviews. I never had any trouble with the battery but I also don't talk on my house phone for more than 30min. All in all it's a nice sleek phone.
2,horrible battery life,"The phone looks cool, but the battery life is awful. It won't even last a day without the battery dying. You can't leave the phone off the hook during the day and expect it to work when you get home."
2,"It's ok, but I am not thrilled about it...","Overall the phone works ok, but I was expecting more from the product. Negative / dissapointing issues include the fact that there is no speakerphone in the base, only in the handset. When left on the base the handset overheats. The microphone quality is not what I was expecting, sometimes with the volume too low even though is in max.The handset has time and date, but the screen is an old liquid crystal one, so it's barely visible unless you actually press a button and a light turns on.And most dissapointing, you can't record while using the phone, like most wireless phones with answering machines, feature I used a lot when I needed to take notes and had no pens around."
1,Battery does not hold charge. VTECH customer support poor,"The phone looks cool, but it stops there.The battery does not hold charge and VTECH customer support has repeatedly ignored requests for a replacement. I would shop other phones. This has been a disaster of an experience.The sound quality is also poor."
1,Only looks good...,"I'm so disappointed. This phone looks really cool it has all of the features I was looking for, but the sound is poor. There is constantly static. I'm returning it and I don't recommend it to others. Don't be fooled by the sleek design."
5,Terrific Phone,"I bought this phone for the DECT technology. Previous phones had interference when walking around the house especially in downstairs office. This phone solved all that, looks great and works without a problem. I was so impressed I bought a second one for my woman friend."
1,Battery won't hold charge at all.,"When i first got the phone, the directions stated to charge each phone for 12 hours before use. So I did just that. For the first few months we noticed that the phones would die if you left it off the base for more than an hour. After about 6 months, we lost one of the phones in the couch for awhile, found it, and put it back on the charger but it won't come back on at all now. After a year we only have one handset that will charge but you can only talk for about 20-30 min before it dies. This is by far the worst product I have ever purchased. I will never purchase another vtech product as long as I live. I don't care if it is a vtech door stopper; I just do not trust their products anymore."
5,excellent,"This book as are all of Van Gulik's was excellent. The Judge Dee mystery series are alway filled with great mystery. I will not give away any of the story, even that given on Amazon web page. One will have to get a copy of this Judge Dee and all of the Judge Dee series. We have read all of the Judge Dee series and throughly enjoy them. Never a dull moment, and fast action. However, they are not for young kids, the age group for these books should start at 16. remember, Judge Dee is Chinese a long time ago."
3,Not so great little book...,"Moderately interesting narrative! What goes against it is it's exorbitant price! That too for such a little book, barely even makes it to 200 pages. Not much value for money."
5,Excellent,"All the ""Judge Dee"" books I have read are good. Some better than others, sure, but I like them all. Intelligent, well written, humane, and even sometimes with a touch of humor. A good mystery is worth a lot and these books by Gulik are certainly that."
4,Art and Artist well served,"Painting Dreams: Minnie Evans, Visionary Artist is an excellent book for children - not to be sterotyped because of its place in the African-American artisan series. I would love to have the book contain more of Evans art but would not give up the text. Mary Lyons has conveyed the social difficulties of being African-American in the early twentieth century not by ""preaching"" but by letting the story speak for itself. The result is a book that is appealing both for its art and for its social conscience."
4,Excellent book for beginners,"Yes, this book is an excellent basic book, for people who are just knitting their first knots, which in this book are clearly explained, drawings included. So beginners, this is an ideal book. The book also offers instructions for some projects (not instructions for all of them), which could be inspiring. However, I think these projects belong to traditional art (folk art, I mean); they are not fashionable. Perhaps the challenge is to create up-to-date clothes from the basic knots."
5,The best modern macrame book yet!,As soon as I opened the cover I knew this book was perfect. On the front and back inside covers there are the pictures and how-tos for every knot for quick reference. It's full of great works of art for inspiration and easy in depth instructions for each knot later in the book. It is definitely what I was looking for and then some. I highly recommend it. :)
5,Easy to follow,This is a really complete book that is detailed and easy to follow with great illustrations and a comprehensive list of designs. So glad to have it now!
3,"If you are looking for plant hanger patterns, this book is not for you.","This books is great if you are looking to make wall hangings or jewelry, but not if you are looking for plant hangers. The pages of how to do a knot are spread throughout the book instead of in one section, making it hard for the beginner to find a specific knot. If you are experienced in macrame, this book is for you."
5,YOU WILL BUY IT ONLY IF YOU ARE DESTINED TO BE HAPPY,"This book will open up new avenues in life for you that you never thought would be possible.If you have any fears in life like getting laid off , bankrupcy ,motor vehicle accident or any kind of personal harm by reading this book you will be able to avoid all things that could cause you harm.PLEASE TRUST MY ABOVE STATEMENT.Please follow the simple message of this book you will receive far more benefit than going to any church ,synagogue , mosque or temple . And it is really simple to implement its message into daily life.God bless you all.I also suggest you to read the works of Neville like Resurrection ,The power of awareness etc . These are priceless gems that can revolutionize your life."
2,Skip It,"I was very excited about this album coming out, but I am sadly disapointed. It has totally steered away from Austin's 60's image to make a weird mix of random stuff The Hard Knock life with Dr. Evil is pretty bad, definetly nothing compared to the Just the Two if Us in the previous movie. ""Work it Out"" with Beyonce has a good beat, but gets boring fast!"
1,"Simply fun, NOT","Previous A.P. soundtracks had been a brillant mix of original music/songs, classic pop/rock, and remixes that were almost as fun as the movies themselves. In contrast, the Goldmember soundtrack won't get many people tapping their feet or smiling at the song choice or getting a kick out of the originally of the pseudo sixties song. Saying that it pales in comparison to AP 1 and AP 2 soundtracks is not strong enough, it is simply not fun or particularly good."
1,A Lame duck,typical of now Re-Making Music&Karoke style Music Making.Beyonce is a'ight in Her Song but the rest of this Soundtrack is not happening.Boring.
1,AUSTIN POWERS:COASTER MATERIAL,"Awful soundtrack.Flat,cornball,and lacks the originality that the other two had(remember Lenny Kravitz's ""American Woman"" and Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger""?).The songs are flat out bad.Beyonce's goofy '70s soul send-up ""Work It Out"" which proves howannoying her voice is;a lame,stiff Dr. Dre remix of the RollingStones' ""Miss You"";Paul Oakenfold's laughable ""1975"" and an awful ""Hard Knock Life"" parody...The only half-decent song is Britney Spears and Pharell's ""Boys""...you know it's bad when a Britney Spears song is the only good song on an album! And do we really have to go to predictible heights by putting ""Shining Star"" on here?Skip this soundtrack.It'll be forgotten in a few weeks anyway."
5,"""""Yummy"""" was my first reaction to this great ...","""""Yummy"""" was my first reaction to this great product. The scent's terrific. I found this lotion to be very effective against dry skin, as well as very soothing. This product kept my skin soft, as advertised. I'd highly recommend Healing Garden's Tangerinetherapy lotion as an aid against dry skin."
3,"The Tangerinetherapy Body Lotion smells great!! That said, ...","The Tangerinetherapy Body Lotion smells great!! That said, I found that the lotion was not thick enough and it didn't last all that long before you felt like you had to reapply. I don't think I'd buy it."
4,The Healing Garden Body Lotion has a wonderful ...,"The Healing Garden Body Lotion has a wonderful silky texture that absorbs well and leaves your hands feeling soft, without a greasy residue. I enjoyed the fragrance, but it was a little overwhelming and it persisted for several hours."
2,Get extended version instead,"This is Pentagngle's first album, and it sounds like it. It is short, stark and the musical range is limited. The CD is 33 minutes long. There are 7 songs and 1 instrumental. Most of the songs are just over 2 minutes long.The is minimalist music. Sometimes it will be just a single acoustic instrument, just playing a simple rhythm, with no emotion. Jaqui MacShay's voice is flat. As the group matured on later albums, the music would become much richer and there would be more depth to the songs. My favorite album is Basket of Light.There is a newer version of this album with 6 bonus tracks that add 20 minutes to the disk. The bonus material is better than the original, with the group showing more emotion and much more fire to the vocals."
3,"3 and 1/2 Stars - Great story, but...","...why buy this when you can get it in other Asimov books along with many other excellent stories? This short story, which can be equally enjoyed by adults and children and is a good way to introduce the latter to science fiction, while certainly a genre classic, is widely available in several different anthologies. For example, you can read it in Asimov's monumental collection The Complete Stories, Volume 1. That said, if you want to own this particular story by itself - a good idea if you're planning on handing it to children, as it is small and lavishly illustrated -, or if you are an Asimov completist, then you will want this nifty and hard-to-find item."
5,A classic,"One of the great lost classics of the early 1970s, Reflection is the Pentangle's best album, IMO. By 1971 the musical scope of the band couldn't be constrained by the label 'folk'; elements of blues, jazz, rock and, yes, psychedelia whirled around in the sound. Yes, the band covers traditional folk on this record, but they still threw a curveball: they're traditional Appalachian folk songs from the US (Wedding Dress, Will The Circle Be Unbroken, and a genius take on Cold Rain And Snow, also covered by the Grateful Dead). Reflection itself is a 10 minute long piece which moves through several moods and themes, anchored by bass player Danny Thompson; this may be his best recording ever. And then there's John Renbourn's So Clear, a wistful, compassionate song about love and friendship that still moves me after many hundreds of playings."
2,Poor Quality Wire Stripper,"The wire stripper included with this item is the worst one I have ever seen. Cheap construction. The hinge was so tight you can barely open it. Impossible to open and close with one hand. The assortment of connectors is not bad. The connectors are mediocre quality and probably OK for the ""not-so-serious-hobbyist"". Bottom line - you get what you paid for."
2,Oh....,Good job I had a crimp tool already - the one supplied is nothing short of pure garbage. In fact that where it ended up after about 5 minutes.The crimps are ok though.
4,Get it just for the terminals,"I ordered this kit primarily for the solderless terminals. A cursory inventory showed that there were as many connectors as in the product description. They range from 10AWG to 22AWG connectors; open-faced, closed face, butting connectors and female connectors.The crimper/stripper that came with the lot is horrible. First, the rivet holding the two sides together is done way too tight, making it needlessly difficult to open and close the tool. Second, when squeezed together, the portions that are supposed to be the stripper does not even butt up. There is no way that this tool can cleanly and reliably cut the insulation off of a wire. Finally, there are burrs left on the tool at every place it was cut or machined. Significant burrs. Ones that could cut you if you let the metal portion slide through your hand even with it shut.Luckily, I already have a decent pair so that these can be tossed."
5,its good,good product for the price. Came in a timely matter and used it for exactly what i wanted to. get it
2,Concerned Quality,"This seems like a good deal , but once I received them I had two of the connectors break off while crimping them which leaves me with some concern as to whether they will keep a good connection after being there for a while? I have to be honest and say that nothing about these really leaves a good taste in my mouth! The shipping was very fast!However shipping is a small part of it if you cannot feel confident with their connectivity!!! I am giving them 2 stars; but that is for shipping , not quality!!!Thanks!"
1,Eh ... revised to a 1,"Needed the terminals and a spare crimper.The terminals are ... terminals --- with inflexible, clumsy insulation. After using a bunch of them in a project I wound up clipping them out and using other ones. Horrible.The crimper is ... a paperweight.I don't have a tension scale, but my guess is 5 pounds to open them.I'm sure I'll find a use for the case."
3,Don't buy it for the crimper,"If I could I'd give it 4 stars for the connectors and storage box and 1 star for the crimper. Do yourself a favor and buy something else if you want a crimper because this one is worthless. The connectors themselves seem decent enough but frankly I wish I'd saved my money on this and just bought the connectors I absolutely had to have.With that said, I did manage to use the crimping tool so it did crimp and did strip some wires but it will probably never get used again because of the frustration it caused in working the tool."
3,"For $10, it gets the job done!","I wouldn't say that this is the set I would like to use every day but for my occasional use, the price was worth it. The pliers don't move very well so you almost need two hands to use them, maybe they will loosen up with use."
1,Wire stripping tool completely worthless,"You get what you pay for, I guess. I picked this item because it was the cheapest one I could find that was compatible with cheap shipping. The wire stripping tool is so poorly made that there is a visible gap about 2-4mm between the where the two sides of the wire stripping area is supposed to meet; making it completely useless. The portion of the tool for wire cutting is meets poorly with the opposite edge as well, but is still usable. The crimping part of the tool seems adequate at first glance. I haven't tried it. I probably won't, since I'm going to go out and buy a proper tool and take this as a lesson learned."
4,"Great value, but be careful","This is a great value for the price, but be aware that the wire stripper does not use conventional markings for wire gauge (like 12, 14, 16, 18 etc.) but some other scale I have never seen. The wire stripper works OK if you happen to hit the right slot. Nice selection of connectors for your shelf for future needs."
3,You get what you pay for.,The stripper/crimp tool is next to worthless - cheap garbage. The connectors were fine though. You get what you pay for.
2,Not the best wire stipper,My order was from the battery geek. The wire stripper is hard to open and close. I probably wouldn't go for this one if your goal is to have a good wire stripper.
3,175 pieces,"Très impressionné de son prix et quantité de terminal et ceci dans un botier très pratique. Par contre, les pinces sont cheap!"
3,"Does the job, crimp tool was usable but not great","Was able to wire up half a dozen solid battery connections with this set. Nothing special about it though. I understand others' complaints about the crimp tool, it's not great but with some care it can be made to work. If I had this to do over I'd probably just get a decent crimp tool at the hardware store and the specific connectors I needed."
2,"The connectors were good, the tool was useless.","Great set of crimp connectors. The stripper/crimper tool was a joke. The stripper wouldn't close enough to strip from the smaller gauge wire and the tool was hard to open and close, let alone use. Luckily I had another crimper/stripper handy.Tip: Leave the connectors in their small bags unless you want them going everywhere in the box. The box does not keep the connectors sorted."
4,Decent for an Offroad Kit,"I purchased this to install my CB and also to have various connectors while trail riding in my Jeep. The kit has a decent selection of connectors. The wire stripper/crimper is nice as well, but has only metric readings on it. If you know the metric equivalent of gauge wire, you'll have no issues with the stripper. Of course, if you don't, you can trial and error you're way to the right one. But, I didn't purchase the kit for the crimper tool."
5,"""Darknessess""...a great follow up to book 1, ""Legacies""","An enjoyable book.As with the first book in the Corean Chronicles, this novel is about our reluctant, humble hero, Alucius: a good guy, whose easy to like, making the book pleasant to read. There is, however, enough action to keep the story interesting and moving along.(with the exception of one, somewhat repetitious part, about 4/5 the way through).If you liked the first book, ""Legacies"", then you will like this one as well. It's not deep, but it is entertaining and will keep you coming back to it until it's finished."
4,Darknesses is a hit!,"Darknesses, the second Corean Chronicles takes up a year later in th military career of our hero. It is jam packed with action, sometimes almost too much with not enough pause between action scenes. Again our hero has to combat evil while trying to keep himself and his troopers alive, not to mention his secret talent. We learn more about the Soarers and the early history of Corus. Our hero's talent and his wife's talent grow in this novel. I had to keep reading to find out what happens to our hero next. I feel some of the battle scenes and wars end a little too quick. The fighting and battles are almost over before you can really get into them. I feel the author could have drawn things out a little more. I look forward to more books in this series as I really enjoyed reading this."
3,Corean Chronicles,"Lets get the good stuff out of the way first. This is the Saga of a world where there are three types of Sentients. All of whom to some degree rely on the Lifeforce to sustain them. Once the force is used up all life ceases on the planet. Mr. Modessitt as usual delves deeply into the characters and brings them to life, and slowly intertwines their lives in a powerful series.Now the bad news, sort of. Paperback publishers have an irritating habit of printing maps and charts from copies of the original hard cover maps, and in the process they lose clarity, and you end up with something unreadable. Now we know that there are ten days to a week, but you have to look hard through all six volumes to find the nursery rhyme that explains it. But you should read them in sequence, starting with Legacy. It is worth it."
2,"Darkness (Corean Chronicles) - mini-me ""Library Binding""","It would be NICE if Amazon would make it clear that the ""Library Binding"" and ""Hardcover Binding"" are NOT EQUIVALENT IN SIZE! The ""Library Binding"" is nothing more than the mass market paperback binding with a hard cover.I was very disappointed."
3,Already almost arrived,"3 1/2A simply and sincerely felt sophomore entry for the eastern post-rock kings, only needing a few steps themselves before formulating their beautiful onslaughts as personally pure possible."
2,NOT the band that did Formica Blues!,"I was thrilled Mono was coming out with another CD. However when I started to play it, I was highly disappointed. No vocals, no beats, just eerie moody dark sounds. So, now I find out it's not the same band that put out Formica Blues. I wish I knew that before I purchased this! The music is tiresome and I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Almost a complete waste of time,"Personally, I found the first 2/3rds of this movie to be mind numbingly boring. It doesn't start to pick up until the last bit. Matt Damon's character is annoying as heck. You're forced to listen to his pointless thoughts which do nothing but bore you to tears. You'll be trying to follow the dialog and then he'll ramble off some useless facts that nobody cares about. I would never watch this movie again unless I was paid a nice amount of money."
2,Can this be a Steven Soderbergh film?,"THE INFORMANT! has an exclamation point after the title for a good reason - it suggests that even the writers and actors as well as the usually superb Steven Soderbergh had a tough time figuring out how to make this story into an entertaining while quite implausible movie. Though based on a true story the movie is basically a running monologue by the hyperkinetic Matt Damon in a role that suits him not at all. At moments it seems like an outrageous comedy, then at others it appears as yet another appalling exposé of how big business and big politics intertwine to the detriment of our environment and moral deterioration. No one seems to know how to treat this piece, and maybe that is just as well. Keep the exclamation point after the title - that sort of tells it all. Side step this film if you are a fan of Soderbergh or Matt Damon. Grady Harp, February 10"
2,Painful to Watch!,"This movie was just painful to watch. What's entertaining about a compulsive liar with (what is likely) a personality disorder? It MIGHT have been funny, but this movie can't decide if it's going to be a documentary, a comedy, a drama, or a farce. It clearly leans towards the latter, but IMO fails to do more than some sad combination of all of these.There is no hero, little tension, and no ""silver lining"" to this dark cloud. It's just a bunch of semi-competent people doing their own ego dance, and playing off each other in a listless circus.AVOID!"
1,A waste of time,"Normally, I love Matt Damon movies. He is a very talented actor and picks amazing movies to star in. But this movie was a complete waste of time. It's about a guy who thinks that he's being a hero and saving the world but he actually shoots himself in the foot by pissing off what few friends he has. Don't bother watching this movie. I can't believe he passed on playing Kirk in Star Trek for this."
2,Matt Damon's worst!,"I had never seen a crappy Matt Damon movie until now. This is definitely his worst! I couldn't make it through the whole movie it was that bad. Can you say BORING? It could have been much better but like another review said, I'm not sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or what. I checked the guide on my cable, and this movie was rated 3 stars. How in the **** can that be? lol Better luck next time Matt!"
4,Better the second time.,"The first time I watched The Informant I was mildly entertained and amused, which was more than I expected. The second time I watched The Informant, 24 hours later, I found it to be hilarious. If it were not based on a true story, and if I were not from mid-western Illinois, and if I had not personally done business with ADM in the past, then I don't know if it would have the same effect on me. I can only say that the back-ground music is appropriate and fits the story. As a side note, I was surprised and amused to see Dickie Smothers playing the federal judge who sentenced Mr. Whitacre. If you haven't seen The Informant yet, I recommend this movie, but watch it twice for extra fun."
3,Narcissism to the extreme,"Matt Damon does a superb job of playing Mr. Whitacre. This man Mr. Whitacre could not keep his mouth shut to the detriment of all involved with him, from his family to his coworkers to the FBI agents.I liked this movie but did not love it. I found it very slow at times. The story could have been consolidated for a qicker paced movie."
4,good story; why no extras?,"This was a good based-on-a-true-story kind of film, with good performances from Damon, Bakula, Lynskey, Brown, and company. Soderbergh did another fine job of directing it, with a tight screenplay by Scott Burns. I won't spoil it by telling you what's really going on with the main character; you need to sit and watch it so you can get full satisfaction in that regard.I just can't fathom why there are no extras on this DVD, as there are on so many others--unless they're really horrible. And this one certainly isn't horrible. It's puzzling."
1,Arguably The Most Boring Movie I've Ever Seen,"How anyone could give this utterly boring, convoluted movie more than 1 star is amazing to me. I fell asleep watching it on 4 different occasions; taking extra care on the last viewing not to start it too late, or drink too much before pressing play. The last time I tried watching it I made it to about the 60 minute mark, before collapsing. It is a shame because Matt Damon is a really great actor. His performance in the Talented Mr. Ripley was dazzling. I also loved his performance in ""Team America"" :-) Seriously though, this movie could have been so much better. But it was as dull as dull can be. Great cure for insomnia though!"
1,Deceptive - NOT A COMEDY!,"Contrary to the sneak peeks of this movie; it is absolutely NOT a comedy.It is not a bad movie, as I would probably give it 2 stars if it weren't so deceptive in classifying itself. The biggest letdown is that they advertise it to be a hilarious comedy, when it is just a story about a guy that has mental problems."
4,The Informant!,"Mark Whitacre has worked for lysine developing company ADM for many years and has even found his way into upper management. But nothing has prepared him for the job he is about to undertake, being a spy for the FBI. Unwillingly pressured into working as an informant against the illegal price-fixing activities of his company, Whitacre gradually adopts the idea that he's a true secret agent. But as his incessant lies keep piling up, his world begins crashing down around him. Mark Whitacre is portrayed by Matt Damon another role that he seemed born to play. ""The Informant"" performances are mostly good, and the story has some surprising twists and turns. ""The Informant"" succeeds at what it set out to do, get inside the head of Mark Whitacre, an intriguing and satisfying movie."
4,Dark comedy.,"Based upon the true story of a bipolar PhD working undercover for the FBI, Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) blew the whistle on ADM and the largest price fixing scheme in agri-business. It is a dark comedy in which Whitacre's good intentions, pressure from FBI, lying to cover his tracks, bizarre personal behavior and poor personal judgment lead to his being indicted for price fixing, wire fraud, tax fraud. He violated his immunity agreement with the FBI and really believed he would lead ADM when the dust settled. Some see him as a criminal, some a hero. View the movie judge for yourself."
3,Lame,"If you are at all interested in the story behind the movie listen to the production of it by ""This American Life"" much more engrossing. I listened to that on the radio first and was excited to see that they had made it into a movie... not worth the price of admission."
2,Ready to be informed?,"I love Matt Damon and Scott Backula, but I do not love this movie. The actors' performances, including the tertiary players, were fantastic. The costumes and sets look great, but the writing and pacing is just boring. I tried but after an hour, I had to stop watching it... I don't think I laughed once. I thought I didn't understand it, but after speaking with friends, they said it wasn't me. The fact that this got a 77% on [...] truly amazes me and I'll have to reconsider them as a recommendation source for future films.Scott Z. Burns wrote this, but produced An Inconvenient Truth. We saw how that turned out. Anything with this Aussie's name on it will be on my ""To Avoid"" list in the future.This movie, in my opinion, is a complete waste of time. It gets two stars for the great acting and settings."
3,Film interesting-SOUND on streaming/Mac was very low!,"Just a tech problem with the film, but a problematic one since I rented this to watch with friend & didn't have decent external speakers available: the sound was MUCH lower than in most Amazon rentals on my MacBook Pro. Annoying glitch that I will be careful about in the future.The film itself is a Soderbergh 3 star. If you like his work the unreliable narrator trope will delight you-and Matt Damon is just fun & convincing. Many of the supporting cast turn in amusing performances as well."
3,Possibilities,"This movie could've been awesome. It was funny, it was well written, and it was one of those movies where you truly did not know what was going to happen. It was paced out well, and it delivered it's necessary information in a methodical manner. I couldn't love it though. Matt Damon. I kept thinking if William H. Macy had been cast for this movie, it would've been perfect. It would've sat on my shelf with all of the other few movies that I buy. If Macy reprised his role in Fargo for this movie, save the Minnesota accent, this would've so much better. Bakula was good, but he's good in everything he does. The actor I loved most in this movie was Tony Hale. We need more Tony Hale in movies. He didn't have a huge role, and he wasn't funny in this role, but he makes every movie more enjoyable in my humble opinion."
2,disapointed.,I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. I know Matt Damon is a great actor and I have seen him do a lot better. This was not what I expected and I found it very dull and anyone could have played the parts.Sorry I bought it and it left a lot out. Boring sums it up
2,Candidate for worst movie of the year,"This is one of the most boring, pointless and sleep inducing films I have seen in a long time. I watched it with a friend and we kept waiting for the plot to develop or for something to happen. Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors but i wanted to ask him to go away and take his movie with him. If there was a plot and point to this movie, We missed it. Hope he has some other films in the works for the future or its back to Hot Dogs and Baked Beans for awhile."
1,The Informant,"Personally found this to be one of the worst movies ever. Very boring, and I kept watching only because I was CERTAIN it HAD to improve.....what a bummer, spent money on a movie I gave away."
1,RE-DI-CU-LOUS!!!,"I watched this movie elsewhere but I thought you needed to know how horrible it was. If I could've given it 0 stars I would've. First off, if you like corn and corn related products, then I say go right ahead and watch it if you can bear it. But, if you are not crazy about the yellow cobs and corn refineries then take my advice and look at something else. The previews looked funny but after watching less than half of this movie, I wanted to rip my hair out(that would have been more entertaining!) My family and I couldn't watch anymore of the movie so we put in 2012 instead.Overall, I give this two thumbs down. Very disappointing!!!"
2,DVD release just as disappointing,"I was an extra in the movie portion shot in Springfield, IL; and I was extremely disappointed to see my scene cut from the film, as well as much of the footage shot in Springfield. I held out hope for the Deleted Scenes on the Blu-Ray version that just came out today. Springfield residents, don't get suckered into buying this (like I did), because there are only a few deleted scenes, and they are pathetic at best; and NONE of them are any added footage shot in Springfield. I personally am through with Matt Damon films at this point."
1,IT SURE ISN'T SCHIZOPOLIS,"Director Soderbergh's brilliant SchizopolisSchizopolis - Criterion Collectionhad my expectations raised too high for this, I thought, spiritless parody of American business. This sad, flat piece of fluff droned for its entire length, was overly convoluted, filled with irrelevant digressions and meaningless information. Hum-drummery at its most vapid worstHumor was dry drone, not droll, cynical and confusing. Confusing as to why SS didn't use anything but a drumming, metronome delivery, with everyone mumbling their way along in occasionally a quasi-documentary style. In other scenes, not much style at all. A grave disappointment. I guess OCEAN'S 11,12,13 just sucked the talent from Soderbergh. Hope he makes a come back, there was talent there, before."
3,Not very funny,"This is one of those movies that looks hilarious in the trailer, but really isn't all that funny when you actually sit down and watch it. I'd give ""The Informant"" only 2.5 stars if Amazon would allow it. The acting is good but the script itself is kind of lacking. This could have been a much funnier story, but it's really not humorous at all."
2,Wanted to like it . . . but just couldn't,"I wanted to like this movie. I usually like Matt Damon movies and I know one of the agents this movie is about. I was really looking forward to seeing this. The problem is the movie just can't decide whether it is a serious piece covering the very interesting true story of an informant with huge problems of his own or whether it is a comedy or a spoof. It does a poor job of being funny and a poor job of being serious. Another reviewer called the movie ""quirky."" That is a good description, but not in the sense that some movies are good because they are quirky. This is quirky in the sense that the director just doesn't seem to have a clear vision of what this movie is intended to be."
2,Just WAY too confusing,"This is not the movie that I thought I was going to see.It's one of those confused, vague wastes of time"
3,The Informant Is Alright,"Lets just get to the review. The movie was funny, not laugh out loud funny, but funny. The main thing I have against the movie is that it just drug on in parts for no real reason. I think it was filmed this way to show how crazy the main character was, but that does not translate into a real sound reason for reflecting such a fact in the movie. The end result was that this thing drug on for too long in a number of spots. So, it was just alright in its filming, and acting. What a disappointment."
4,"An amusing foray with great voiceover work for Matt Damon in ""The Informant""","Length:: 4:34 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""The Informant!"", starring Matt Damon. Just goes to show how much better Matt Damon is at acting than Ben Affleck. Sorry![...]"
1,Technical Garbage,"The music is beautiful, but the technical level is this CD is very bad. At least half of the tracks contain clipping, that means they were recorded too loud on the CD. Track 3 is the worst. If you own it, don't play it too loud, it may damage your speakers. Don't buy this one."
5,el chevere de la salsa y el caballero del son,es la fusion de 2 grandes exponentes de la musica cubana
3,A Little disappointed,"I was disappointed that the planets were'nt identified and the print is too small for my old eyes. All in all, it wasn't a good purchase for me."
2,Check what you Get,Product is good. In general I love these things. It's a useful tool for beginner to intermediate sky watchers.MY PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT I bought it as a gift for my son and when I received it I immediately wrapped it up. After he opened it (and I believe after the return policy expired) we realized we were shipped the 40 degree SOUTH latitude version. Seeing as we don't live in AUSTRALIA this is of little use to us. So just double check what you get.
3,Wheel edges breaking up,"Most of the wheel is coated in plastic and rugged but the part you have to turn breaks apart, separating, over time and makes it harder to turn. Works but really need to put a better coating on the wheel itself or select a differing material."
3,kind of tricky,"This is more my fault. it takes some time to get used to, a red light and a really dark sky."
2,Latitude is off! Not good for latitude 41 degrees N,"Nice quality product with its sturdy lamination. Charts are very clear. However, it says for 40 - 50 degree N Latitude. I'm at latitude 41 degrees and I can see very easily 95% of Scorpius and Sagittarius in my sky. This planisphere doesn't even include them on it AT ALL! On their chart, Orion never gets more than a few degrees above the horizon -- not the case at all were I am (it rises very much higher). Would be better suited for someone farther north than me."
4,No flaws,"This product is wonderful to have out during a night of observation. It is recommended for anyone who is trying to learn the night sky and anyone who is using a telescope/binoculars for astronomy. Very easy to use, it's simple, and it works. Really no faults with this product."
3,Sci fi and fantasy stories about strong women,"This anthology is the second of two (the first being Amazons!) collections of science fiction and fantasy stories about tough women. Put together in the early 1980's, when strong female characters were less common than they are today, it was an important collection at the time.ContentsFor a Daughter, by F.M.

R. Martin"
4,Across the Years,"Great story - I always enjoy Tracie Petterson's books. This is #2 in the Desert Roses series, but could also be read as a stand-alone book."
5,Soft Magnetc Letters,"These letters are great for several reasons. They are built to last - strong enough to be used daily throughout the years. Quiet - no clicking sound like the plastic letters emit. Tactile-friendly, kids want to use them (as do I). The vowels are all yellow for easy retrieval.I am a para-educator and work in multiple classrooms. These are lightweight and easily transportable."
5,Great letters,These letters are the perfect size for little 3 yr old hands. I also prefer this type of magnetic material
2,Why,I guess I am still wondering why even bother to make a film like this. Except for the characters running around Europe and seeing the main character jumping into bed with a new man at every stop I haven't figured out why I would have bought this movie and why anyone would get anything out of it by watching. I guess it might be me but I have seen many more movies that are so much better then this one. I think it was a waste of my time and money.
1,Warning: Not Available,"I recently tried to order this item, and after several months of approving delays, was informed that Amazon could not locate a copy. This item should be removed."
5,SD Gundam,"SD Gundam force is the best Gundam show out there. Not only is it computer generated it doesn't look like a child drew it with a pack of dull colored pencils like the older Gumdams'. It has the rich storyline that makes you get into the the characters and maes you sad to see it end. it's a great show for kids and adults,I can't wait till I buy it!"
5,Wouldn't be without it!!,"Wrinkle Free is great for travel, and I always keep some on hand when I'm at home for those times when I don't want to pull out the iron. It's quick and hasn't ever spotted any fabric. A truly useful and wonderful product."
1,I don't know what product these other people have reviewed...,"...but this product doesn't work at all for me--my clothes are cotton, and I remove them from the dryer ASAP, but still end up ironing (not a horrific thing, just not what I expected from this product's claims). Every item of clothing has looked exactly the same after following the directions."
5,Great!,No issues. Online books are easy to purchase and easy to use! I now purchase virtually all my books this way.
5,Better option than those cheap plastic ones,"Our kitchen was flooded once when a the icemaker supply line burst, it was those cheap plastic ones. Replaced to this, much easier to connect(endings are factory installed), it fit perfectly to our GE fridge."
2,Awkward,"Of course reviewing a book by its cover is ridiculous, but this catalog's cover keeps slipping off, which is annoying enough to merit a mention. And then there are those stupid fold out pages, so I spend half the time like a tourist trying to manage an unruly map, and inevitably they rip. As for the content, well, the text descriptions of some of the artists use interesting terms like ""conceptual trigger,"" but the photos of the art itself are small and dull on thin, uncoated paper. And as the descriptions of the artists read more like frommers than lonely planet (I.e. positive only), it's hard to value the text too much. Buy the ""PS1 Greater New York 2005"" instead. You can get more out of the Whitney book by googling the artists' names.I should say that the introduction by Chrissie Iles and Philippe Vergne is superb, but you can read that online:[...]"
3,Chakra Chants,"I have other CDs for meditating with your chakras and I have to say that they are better. I was expecting the same from this one. I recommend instead ""Chanting the Chrakas"" and ""Healing Chraka Chants."" They both have great music and vocals. One of my Reiki teachers had told me to get this and I have to say that I am disappointed in ""Chakra Chants."""
5,great CD,"Really great music. 1 of the few must haves. probably one of the Artists best pieces of work. Instruction booklet was why I purchased, I already bought the music by it's self on ITunes."
3,It's Still Jade,"This recording is all about Yellow Eyes for me. In this early seventies Vertigo period for the band, their records reflect a search for a sound. In the process, they often capture some ""gems tunes"" Most of this album is a rushed second release from the band and almost sounds like a film score in the style like the movie soundtrack, Shaft! I respect their virsitility, but just feel that the album falls short on overall appeal and consistency. Then we come upon Yellow Eyes and we are graced with the caliber of sound that the first Jade Warrior album achieves. JUST my opinion. Great spin!"
2,Disappointment,"Quality is poor. Stickers used for images used on porcelin. For these reasons, I do not recommend. Although it is truly a Disney product."
3,"Yes, they are stickers on the porcelain","The set itself is beautiful. Like previous reviews, i wish the princesses were actually engraved into the pieces. Currently the set is just on display."
3,Cute but tiny,It is a cute set and decently priced for being porcelain however it is a mini tea set. I'd say it is about 1/2 the size of a normal tea set. The 4 year old it was purchased for loved it though so that makes it worth it.
3,Just Eh,"I was hoping for something a little more durable and bigger. The princesses are just stickers that can be easily peeled off, rather than printed on the ceramic.It's also a very small set, great for little hands but not for a tea party which was my intent.Overall it's a cute set but it doesn't meet the needs I was going for. I will likely be getting a new set in a year when my daughter (2 years old) outgrows this tiny set."
5,"Jorn : ""The Duke""","If you love original Metal / Rock N' Roll, and haven't heard Jorn, you need to do yourself a favor, and pick up ""The Duke"" immediately. I think Jorn is one of the best / most inspiring musicians of our time, and ""The Duke"" is certainly my favorite solo project of his to date....You can't really go wrong here, every song cranks. Jorn is truly a master when it comes to producing great music, and once you've heard this I'm sure you'll agree. This is just one of his many great offerings, and I would also recommend his side projects in Masterplan / Ark...."
5,"Peaceful,relaxing...the music takes you to a quieter time","Mr. Ender has created a CD that is delightful to listen to, one that carries you away to the serenity of the hills of the Ancient Isles. The cover is awesome!"
4,Buck Owens at his best,"Just got into Buck, after learning how much he influenced others. He's really great! Don Rich was amazing, too."
4,Yep! It's a mini. Solid for backpacking,MINI! but great. I failed to look at the exact dimensions. This spatula is about as big as a plastic spoon. But it gets the job done and is perfect for backpacking when space and weight is so limited. I wasn't thrilled about price (around $7) but I'm happy about the product all the same.
5,"The Who's Best definately, but could be a little bit better","This ia great album and I would definatly reccomend not only to beginners but also to collecters. This site is one of the only places in the world that has this album new. The two things that could make this album the best album from 1988 would be changing the shortened versions of 'Who Are You' and 'Won't Get Fooled Again' into there full length version. Otherwise, this is definately The Who's Best. GET IT!!!"
5,You Won't Be Able To Put It Down,"In the true Bronte tradition, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is passionately romantic. None of that polite Austenian affection here. Each character whole-heartedly throws him/herself into everything; even if it's only drinking tea.Anne Bronte has woven a story within a story by creating love-smitten Gilbert Markham as the narrator. He has totally fallen for the mysterious new girl in town. But what is the secret she is hiding from the neighborhood? Ah, that is your story that's within the story.This book resounds with dark tones, though a candle of hope always flickers for the reader. Anne brings us to the precipice of human darkness , but does not allow us to fall. The strength of love is the great balancer. It ultimately secures hope and happiness for the characters who deserve it.You won't be able to put this book down. It's truly gripping."
2,Reader,"A good read for the ""English"" book lover, but not as good a story as her sister's books are. Too wordy although the antiquated verbiage was comforting to read again in a Bronte book."
4,Marrying for love despite Auntie's advice,"Helen chooses to marry for ""true love"" but does she REALLY know her husband. For those readers who think they can overcome their mates short comings and reform them. Does she find happiness? Read it and see as it is a good read."
4,Catching up on classics,Interesting story. I never think of people in that era being so messed up. Why do they have so much free time on their hands?
3,Old-fashioned soap opera,"This book is really like modern day soap operas. There are a bunch of characters that participate in a lot of gossip about a subject that they really know little about. It gets bogged down in that at points, but it's still a great story. For a modern reader, it's easy to dismiss the subject matter as much ado about nothing. I'm sure that he had a lot of impact at the time that it was written."
3,Another sad Anne Bronte book,The sadness of the Bronte sisters continues in this book but I did enjoy it more than the other Anne Bronte book I've read.
3,Started out grand.....,"I really loved how this story started out....I was engrossed and it was a page turner. It got stuck somewhere in the middle towards the end. Stuck, boring and quite annoying. Too much...""All for the Just Cause"" etc etc. It just didn't enjoy the last half or so...it died."
1,sibling rivalry,"Anne cannot write up to her famous sisters. What a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Too long, too wordy, too predictable and the heroine is insipid."
5,The Cure For the Common Radio Fodder,"I first picked up a copy of Robben Ford and the Blue Line in 1993, and it quickly became one of my favorite albums. The trio breathes life into the blues yet makes it sound fresh at the same time. Ford's guitar style fits tracks like ""Cut Me To the Bone"" and ""Tell Me I'm Your Man"" perfectly. It's very hard to imagine anyone but Robben Ford playing these songs. The rhythm section is also the perfect complement to Ford's tasteful playing. While tasteful, Ford's guitar playing is definitely not over the top like a lot of today's guitarists. So, if you want a taste of what the modern blues should sound like, do yourself a favor. Put Robben Ford and the Blue Line in your shopping cart."
4,Solid Effort,"I'm not a big fan of this particular genre of music. However, I am very impressed with this CD. The tunes are well crafted and executed, and the recording is clean. The final trak, No. 9 ""Life Song"" is AWESOME!"
3,"Excellent guitarist, awful singer.","I am sorry, but he insists on singing which brings the performances down. It is disconcerting to hear a man play gut wrenching blues/rock guitar, then try to sing with a souless, pencil thin voice. To really hear Robben play, pick up one of his CD's with Jimmy Weatherspoon."
1,Doesn't last long,"The Victorian Collection is installed in our newly remodelled home. It looks great, but so far 2 of these handles have broken when trying to flush the toilet.This product seems to be OK for a few weeks, and then it breaks."
1,design/manufacturing flaw,"The Delta Providence Venetian Bronze flush lever PRO60-VBRseemingly shares this problem: at least on some,the brass lever arm, which is secured by a set screw,jams against outer, threaded part of the handle assembly,forcing the entire assembly to rotate,where only the inner shaft should rotate with the lever.Whether this is a parts tolerance problem or incorrect factory assembly,it evidently does not occur with all.Finding no obvious way to disassemble the handle assembly and fix this,we returned instead of installing it."
1,Defective - company in process of recalling,This lever doesn't install correctly. I called the company and they confirmed that it is deffective and suggested I return it.I can't judge how long the company knew about this and whether they are making a reasonable effort to recall - but certainly don't buy this particular product.
1,"Looks great, made like junk.",Perfect match for the other accessories. Handle made of cheap cast material and snapped off while flushing the toilet.
1,Poor Quality,"Did a minor bathroom upgrade & purchased this to match the rest of the bathroom hardware & fixtures and found this Delta 75060-RB toilet tank lever to be very poorly made. The handle screws into the back plate...big design flaw there. It was stripped within 3 days of installation. There were only about 3 threads total on the shank so not much leverage. Purchased another exactly like this at Home Depot and got the exact same result. Finally ended up buying a close look-alike that cost less than half what the Delta brand did at Home Depot and it's been in and working perfectly for months now. It too screws into the back plate but the threaded shank is longer, heavier and therefore stronger than the lightweight pot metal Delta used for their handle. Save your money unless you have welding skills and like to fix what you've just bought. This is one time ""made in Taiwan"" was better than Delta's ""made in China"". Tsk, tsk Delta! Your name used to be synonymous with quality."
1,Waste of Money,"I loved this handle for a couple of weeks. It was beautiful and matched the other Delta victorian items. Then one night, my husband flushed the toilet, and the handle snapped in two. I wish I had saved my money."
1,Broken Within a Day,"Loved the look of this toilet tank lever, but after installing it and using it for a day, the handle broke off. Another frustrating issue about this lever is the loose fit. It doesn't fit snugly against the tank and wiggles with use. Very disappointing..."
3,3 stars,"Though it wasn't one of Whodini's greatest efforts, it was still a pretty good album back then."
4,Great for mixing up a few drinks.,This kit is really nice. It has just about everything you will need for a night mixing drinks with your friends. I used it the first night it arrived and it also looks great sitting out on my counter top.
4,"One of the better ""private pressing"" reissues out there..","Brave Radioactive Records brings us here another obscure ""private pressing only"" LP from Lord knows where. What you see is what you get for the artwork, just a copy of the record label in its tattered sleeve. No production credits, no list of performers, no dates, no etc. I slipped this into my car player with a few other selections and, by the time I got down the road, I had forgotten what I was listening to. When this CD's turn came up, I thought ""What's that, it's pretty good."" And the feeling held up over several plays. Stylisticly, think Kinky Friedman. Good job, Radioactive, thanks for bringing us this."
4,Excellent Boogie,"Overall, I prefer ""Dr John Plays Mac Rebennack"" slightly to this set, but both are winners. On ""Average Kind of Guy"", Dr. John sings:""Overworked and underpaidUnderloved and overlaidI'm just an average kind of guy""Killer stuff. Average, he is not. He's one of those musicians that really must be seen to be fully appreciated and for that, I recommend the New Orleans Jazz Festival. But to get back to this record, if you love piano blues and jazz, you'll love this album and be sure to check out ""Plays Mac Rebennack"" too."
2,Headline,No wonder it was being sold for that amount. I was looking more for pressure cooking basics such as cooking times and types of foods to prepare.
3,Bad Print Job,"I'm not sure what condition was advertised with this book when I purchased it, but it is in pretty poor condition. The print on many of the pages has bled through making it difficult to read the recipes."
2,"Not a charger, a charging STAND","I was disappointed to find that this was not a charger but a charging stand, requiring your plug-in charger to operate it. It also won't charge a phone in a case, so unless you want to dress and undress your phone every couple of days, you might want to give this one a bye."
2,Great in home charger,"This in home charger is great. I like to keep a back-up battery charged and this charger is very handy. You can charge-up the your spare battery by it's self, or the phone by it's self, or you can put the phone and spare battery on the charger together and charger will charge them both (phone first then battery)."
3,Completed Circle,"Visions of My Ancestors, came to my awareness in 1990 during a visit with a friend in New Mexico. She played her cassette of Kenny Passarelli's as we drove through the beautiful country in and around Santa Fa. I have longed to hear that music since and searched the itunes, but could not find it. Finally, I found his music on Amazon in CD format. I ordered it and received it within just days for a very fair price. I love the ease of transacting business online."
5,Wish I Had this 10 years Ago!,"My husband, who does little to nothing on the computer, only dictated this line to me: ""I wish i had this book 10 years ago!"" He says it is a must have for every dad and requested i find and buy him everything Steve Farrar has ever wrtiten. I did! Specifically, the author breaks down the various personality types and talks about the necessity for each in life and how a dad can appreciate, mentor, direct and affirm his son(s) for the Glory of God and honorable masculinity in general.King Me: What Every Son Wants and Needs from His FatherKing Me: What Every Son Wants and Needs from His Father"
5,So young and so talented,"DJ Armin Van buuren, #5 ranked in 2002. 24 years old. This Kid will soon be #1, he'll be the new PVD. this CD is great, definitely worth it. I garantee it!! See you guys at the winter music festival in miami.Peace"
2,Not a Quality Case,"The Solo 17-inch Business case looks good in the pictures, but is poor quality construction. The side panel material was lose right out of the box and continued to loosen over a short period of time. The side material dents easily and the lid is out of adjustment with very little use. I like the look of the case, but not the quality. My 17.3 inch screen laptop fits perfectly in the case and has more protection than a soft-side bag. I do not recommend this item."
4,Holds all the money,"Great case, like the Velcro insert that you can move around to adjust to your laptop size. Only thin I have problem with is you have to pull the top of the case a bit to get it to seat properly, but even my guitar does the same thing. Its held up with all the hauling around and kept my stuff safe."
2,Live in Moscow plus Wildest Dreams,"The same live recording (different song order) as released in the original ""Live in Moscow""...only this release adds ""Wildest Dreams"" and deletes the unreleased ""Kari-Anne"". That was a huge mistake in my opinion...""Kari-Anne"" was one of the band's best songs, and I think ""Wildest Dreams"" was taken from another concert (""Live in Nottingham"", I think). The album does include the two earlier Wetton band songs (""Starless"" and ""Book of Saturday"") with their different arrangements. Also included in both versions of this live album, is the more powerful version of ""The Smile Has Left Your Eyes"", which is more hard hitting than in it's original release."
3,Not a bad live album,"I've never been a big fan of live albums, but this one is okay. You've got all of Asia's hits on here plus some King Crimson songs. There's also a new Asia song at the end called ""Kari-Anne."" My favorite thing about this album is Geoff Downes keyboard solo. Worth a listen."
3,Robben Ford's voice.,"This dude's a first rate guitarist, but his voice is extremely annoying with its nasal, whiny tone. He should hire a good blues singer or stick to instrumentals."
4,Robben Ford Mystic Mile,"I've had this tape for quite a while now and wanted to update to a cd. What can you say about robbens playing, he does not disappoint. Clean playing, great tone, good songs, great version of political man."
3,Decent but distracting,"Often cited flower power release features dueting male/female performers often creating contrasting vocal patterns over softly strummed, fairly composed acoustic guitar. Besides somewhat dated production, Sallyangie suffers from overdone singing, particularly with the too-high female pitch which sometimes comes across unintentionally humorous. Despite it's flaws this is still an intriguing piece of late 60's folk that deviates enough from it's standard patterns to stick out."
3,NOT FAIRPORT OR PENTANGLE..,"IF YOUR HERE BECAUSE YOUR A MIKE OLDFELD FAN, OR LIKE MUSIC LIKE 'TUBULAR BELLS', KEEP LOOKING..I BOUGHT THIS ON A RECOMMENDATION FROM A PENTANGLE PURCHASE...NOT EVEN CLOSE. SOME OF THE SONGS ARE WELL CONCEIVED, BUT I FIND SALLY'S VOICE SHRILL AND CONTRIVED..SHE SOUNDS, AND LOOKS, TRAUMATIZED//...MIKE IS PLAYING GUITAR AND IS OBVIOUSLY QUITE YOUNG. HE GETS AN E FOR EFFORT, BUT THIS MATERIAL IS BELOW HIS WATERMARK..FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY ONLY... BRITMAN.."
3,Some of it was interesting and some of it was'nt.,"This book was in no way as good as ""The Big Book Of Conspiracies"" or ""The Big Book Of The Unexplained."" The book was not a complete waste of time, but your better off going with the two books mentioned above for a better read."
2,"OK, although a bit cliche'd","Once again, there's a wide spectrum of quality in this book due to the number of writers and artists involved. It goes all the way from gems like the item on Velikovsky to real disappointing repeats of the media version of McCarthy's saga. McCarthy has long since been vindicated by released communist documents since the fall of the Wall, but either out of intellectual laziness or a fear of going against ""the known facts"" this book continues to make him out to be wrong.There is a lot of good material here that somewhat offsets the bad."
2,Lost the scent,"The seller sent it quickly and well packed. Unfortunately, as it is a discontinued product, I think it must be old, as it had lost the scent. Oh well, lesson learned."
4,Good Starting Point,"Good starting point for the curious. Most of her biggest hits are here, though some of them don't really represent her ""best"" recordings: ""Back in the USA"" ""Heatwave"" and ""Just One Look"" are no match for the originals, and there are a few glaring omissions: 'Desperado' 'Get Closer' and the Grammy winning 'I Can't Help it If I'm Still in Love With You', but there are plenty enough gems ""You're No Good"" ""Long Long Time"" ""Don't Know Much"" and ""Heart Like a Wheel"" among others to demonstrate while Linda was one of the five most successful female vocalists in popular music for 15 years."
2,She Hasn't Worn That Well,"It's difficult to fault Peter Asher's management of her career, but, with hindsight, he did her no favors as a producer -- at least during her R&B;/rock period. When you listen to her back catalog now, the thing you most notice -- as many others have pointed out over the years -- is far too many covers, performed by a voice that is a beautiful instrument but with arrangements and a delivery that are blah in the extreme. At best, they leave you wondering why she and Asher bothered, if they weren't going to do something fresh with the songs; at worst, they leave you yearning for the originals.Her most realized albums from that period are those that introduced new material and/or reintroduced little-known gems -- ""Hasten Down the Wind"" and half of ""Heart Like a Wheel."" ""The Very Best of..."" only highlights the fact that the very best of Linda Ronstadt is not nearly as good as it should have been."
1,Missing Too Many Hits,"There's no reason to omit the Top 10 hit ""How Do I Make You?"" from 1980. It would have easily fit on the disc. As it is, this collection is incomplete."
3,Not the best choice maybe...,"No doubt there is a lot of good music here, but based on price and selection, I wish I had bought Greatest Hits 1&2 instead; it is a little more than half the price and includes Desperado and Tumbling Dice, which seems like a significant omission from something titled 'The Very Best of...'"
5,THIS ONE'S FANTASTIC!,"Boy can this girl sing! Her music is so versatile that one never gets tired of playing her music. My wife and I bought a lot of her 45s while we were dating, now it's good to hear her songs once more on CD."
5,Doesn't get any better than this!,"Absolutely every single great Linda Ronstadt song is on this CD. While listening to it, one realizes the incredible vocal range and talent of this legendary singer. This is the second one I bought - the first has been ""borrowed"" by my 25 year old son."
5,They Very Best of Linda Ronstadt,Linda Ronstadt has one of the purest voices and I have been a loyal fan of hers for over thirty years. This CD features all of her best songs and will transform you to whatever year you want to go back to. EXCELLENT!
5,THE VERY BEST OF THE ELEKTRA YEARS,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLETE COMPILATIONF OF LINDA IN THE ELEKTRA YEARS, ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY COMPLETE AND ALL THE TRACKS ARE HITS I RECOMEND TO BUY HER TWO CLASSIC ALBUMS GREATEST HITS VOLS. I & II WITH THIS NEW & REMASTERD ALBUM, TOGETHER MADE THE COMPLETE LINDA COLLECTION FROM ELEKTRA.""OOH BABY BABY"", ""SOMEONE TO LAY DOWN BESIDE ME"", ""SILVER THERADS & GOLDEN NEEDLES"" & OTHERS ARE NOT HERE."
3,A compromise,"This CD is a compromise between the more comprehensive box set and the original and superior two-volume ""Greatest Hits"" recordings I'd recommend over this one.Those two recordings were perfectly chosen songs in chronological order (they should really be combined onto one CD). This CD gives you more songs per dollar, but I'd rather pay more and have the best songs in the order in which they were released.I not only agree with the reviewer below who felt this wasn't really the ""very best"", but it would drive me crazy hearing ""Different Drum"" after solo work done a decade later, or ""Heart Like A Wheel"" after songs from much later and lesser albums. I prefer hearing the way an artist grew over time on a best-of collection. Still, not a bad collection and recommended if you prefer shuffle-play."
4,the better hits,"I'm actually relieved that ""how do i make you"" was left off this album. that was a song that i always fast forwarded through...probably the worst song she ever recorded. (simply obnoxious to my ears and a waste of her voice).i had this album many years, and listen to it every once in a while...i just came here to get a replacement because mine got scratched.i always wondered why she recorded it...recently i read an interview with linda and she said she never really felt comfortable in the rock genre, and loves exploring other styles."
3,Rubber Chicken for Lab,"While the chicken is ""cute"", our Lab has shown very little interest in it, and she loves toys but I guess just not chickens."
4,For that pet with an outgoing sense of humor,"Our Jack Russell took to the chicken immediately and is working it into his stand-up routine. Our obese Chihuahua, however, is a christian and doesn't go much for this gregarious type of toy.This rubber chicken is a tough customer - will stand up well to heavy play and chewing (the original mc-chicken, if you will). Consumer tip: Before presenting, brush on a low sodium chicken broth and allow to dry."
1,I'm so sad!,We were so excited to get the rubber chicken. After reading the reviews I thought that it would stand up to the jaws of steal.not so much...Less than 3 minutes and our boxer had mr.chicken's wing and leg torn right off.I guess I either have a defective chicken or a defective dog.I'm quite sad...I'm still looking for a toy that he won't destroy.Perhaps I need to look in automotive.
3,My dog loves it!,"Toy quit squeaking after a day because the chicken doesn't re-inflate itself after being squeezed, even after gentle use. My dog babies her toys! Luckily my dog still loves it! I did learn that I can re-blow up the chicken and in turn make it squeak by blowing into the hole on the bottom, although my dog seems not to care either way. Coloring on chicken has not peeled or worn off which I was concerned about when purchasing. Safe for use for pets!"
2,Great while it lasted.. about 10 minutes with my lab,"My dog loved this chicken, but was tearing pieces off of it within 10 minutes. They really shouldn't advertize this as a dog toy unless your dog has no teeth."
1,Disappointing as a Dog Toy,"I got this product because it had good ratings for durability as a pet toy. My dog LOVES squeaky toys and chews on them until she rips out the squeaker. She was super excited when I got it out of the box and loved it immediately. Unfortunately within five minutes she had the rooster's comb mostly chewed off entirely. I had to take it away from her, because the rubber was coming off in pieces large enough for her to choke on.Maybe this product is durable for smaller dogs or something, but my dog is 40 pounds and she was already destroying it after just a few minutes."
4,Funny,This was a hit at our office employee Christmas party. This chicken was passed around a few times at the gift exchange.
5,Favorite!,"The uber-poodle has his favorite toys, and this is at the top of the list. He has another one, and that's why I got this one. He spends a lot of time in the car, so I wanted him to have a cache of toys there so I wasn't dragging them back and forth. This one is different from his old one, and he just LOVES it! It's loud, just so you know. Somehow, we've gotten so used to the sounds these make, we just laugh at them, we'd probably think it was too quiet if they every stopped all the noise!"
1,chopped chicken after 20 min,My JRT had this chewed up in 20 min. After the squeaker was removed he lost interest. Too expensive and it smells like cheap rubber too.
5,great!!!,"i paid $13 for mine brand new!!!this item is long out of print and very very rare so,you probably wont find this in the store or i-tunes!!i personally think this is has 2 be his best work,it features above the law on the last track.Track number 7 is funky as funkDONT MISS OUTT!!! I HAVE BEEN MISSING OUT 4 A LONG TIME!!!THIS ALBUM WAS PRODUCED BY ABOVE THE LAW AND EAZY E!!!!"
4,"Don't let the name ""economy"" fool you...this is great quality.","Jingles are bright, melodious, and loud. Fiberskyn sounds great, like a professional drum head, and looks appealing, speckled much like real goatskin. The fiberskyn seems so much better quality than the iridescent or white Remo tambourines I have borrowed from friends, which have a plastic feel and sound to them.Wondering if you should get single or double row jingles? Consider that double stretches your hand out more with the wider band, and double jingle tambourines are heavier and demand more on your wrists, and the volume is definitely louder."
3,Patchy but largely enjoyable,"This 20 track compo misses some of the big hits but includes some absolute gems; 'Alesha' (based on the anthemic 'Greetings' rhythm)& 'Tidal Wave' are just two of the standout tracks but the quality remains generally fair to high on the rest of the tracks including the all-time favourite 'Worries in the dance'.There are some weaker/less well known tunes on here but despite this it's still a pretty nice compilation, if not the ideal introduction to Frankie's undeniable talent and unique voice."
3,Mist - Sheepdog Tales from Amazon,"I was a little bit disappointment in this DVD. It advertised that Derek Jacobi was in it, but he was only the narrater. It should have specified that. It's cute though, and I love dogs, so I enjoyed it."
1,No dont buy this,"dont buy this cd, listen to namie amuro instead if you really wanna get real j-pop. this cd is so fake~"
3,"excellent writing, not that interesting","Hawthorne's writing style is excellent, perhaps one of the very best in english. and his idea is good too, i'll give him that. but the story is not made very interesting. developed too slowly. too much about the family affairs, and too little about the mystery. not enough susepence for me."
3,"This book has its faults, but it is very readable.","This book had a pretty good plot. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that it seemed so incredibly negative and depressing. I tend to not like depressing books. Although, my view might be slightly warped since I was about 12 when I first read it. Hawthorne certainly had some interesting ideas.I can understand, though, the view that he came from. I mean, if my great-great grandfather condemed innocent women to death in the tragic Salem Witch Trials, I would be slightly negative, too. No wonder he changed his name.This book was very readable. I liked the description. I enjoyed the book a great deal."
3,Not as Good as Scarlet,"I found this to be much slower and generally more boring than the Scarlet Letter and many of the stories in Twice Told Tales. However, it's still Hawthorne and worth reading."
2,Very Mixed Feelings,"I am currently reading this book. It is the legend of the House of the Seven Gables that makes the novel interesting - the curse the House bears and those troubled characters living within neglected walls and shrouding darkness make for an intruiging read. I have to admit, though, that this book is a very heavy read for me. It seems unnecessarily poetic and lacking in action. At times my mind wanders from the words my eyes are habitually tracing across the pages, but there are other times when I am absolutely absorbed. But I'm only absorbed periodically for only about a third of the read, and overall it's just not working for me. I'm driven to the end if only to see what becomes of these odd, cursed beings who are seemingly manipulated through this book by a rather dark destiny."
4,house of 7 gables,"Sometimes the old classics are a tough read due to phrasing, etc. this was a lot easier than some. makes you want to go to Salem and see the house."
1,????,couldn't get into reading. I found this book was very difficult to get interested in. Wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"From looking at the cover, I knew it was going to be a ""classic"", but I did expect a better read. This book is terrible and I never finished it. Save your money here."
2,Go See the Movie,"I decided to read this book after seeing the movie with Vincent Price and George Sanders on TCM. It wasn't bad. Usually the book is more informative and entertaining than the movie. For example, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was a great movie, but the book was even better. Hawthorne seems to go on and on before getting to the point. So I give this book a sub-mediocre rating."
3,Book content,"The book condition was fine. I am disappointed in the story. I thought he could do better, kjghlopiugpoiug piuhpuhphg uhpiuhgpgh"
2,Slow,The Prose is very good. I could feel myself in that time and place. I did not find anything scary or romantic. Nathaniel Hawthorne said he considers this a great romance. I could find no romance so I think he was using a type of romance we in the 21st century do not understand. I was not able to connect to any of the people as real. The narrator did a wonderful job with giving each character their own voice as well Nathaniel Hawthorne his own point of view. If you can get into this story pleas write to me and let us see if I can understand why this is a classic.
1,Almost a total massacure of this classic gem...,"House of Seven Gables has been one of my favorite classics since the middle school days, decades ago. This review is of the CDs and the performance of the narrator himself, not about the novel. The reason I decided to buy it in the first place was becasue it was on sale for $15, and the fact that it's unabridged. Anthony Heald has terrible reading speed, he would pause at wrong places while not stopping at periods. Anyone that has read classic novels would know that most of them have long sentences with many semicolons, and conjunctions. He sounded like he's catching his breath quite often, and his pronounciation is kind of slurred as well. At least it didn't cost me that much. If you search for unabridged audio editions of this book, you'll find a few others by different companies, which all cost at least $30 or more. If you are poor then get this one, it's the cheapest. I'm certainly shopping for another set."
3,Enjoyable but not spectacular,"Though there were definitely times when this book was slow or difficult to understand, Hawthorne's writing, through the use of metaphors, allusions and other rhetorical devices is a wonderful accomplishment. It was hard for me to get into the book at the beginning and especially through the long discussion of the Pyncheon family but it payed off to know this information when the climax arose. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book, but was not totally impressed by the story, reguardless of the universal themes that apply to us today."
3,Very Slow,"I have come to the conclusion that this is a novel you will either love or you just can't get into it. I am one who couldn't get into it. Hawthorne gets off of the topic often and takes forever to accomplish the discription of something I felt most writers could have done more quickly and more succesfully. All of the discription seemed excessive and only confused me. I had to force myself to read the first half of this book, and by the time I had reached that point I came to the conclusion that if it hadn't already captured my attention then it wasn't going to.I have always enjoyed early American literature, Greek literature, and have read my fare share of William Shakespeare, but I just couldn't enjoy this one. It was just too dry, and the story really seemed to go no where. I really couldn't recommend this one to anyone as a good read."
4,"Great condition, too many shipping companies","The book arrived in good condition, well-wrapped but I would hesitate to buy from here or anywhere again which uses DHL and then transfers the order to another company for delivery. The order was going from Texas to Calif, and could have reached here in just a few days if it had been just given to the USPS. Instead it traveled one and a half times around the country with DHL (according to the tracking record it went from Texas to Kentucky then finally to California, where it was given to USPS to deliver.) Yes, it arrived within the 19 days window, but that was a very silly route to take. At the same time another order of mine came from the east coast to here in only 3 days directly with the USPS. I've since heard from others that DHL is only convenient for global orders not domestic. Never again."
2,This is Not for teenagers.,This may be a good book for adults. I read it in 8th grade and could not stand it. It is very slow moving and descriptive. This is not what teenagers want.
1,At least I can say I read it,I wish I could say I enjoyed it. The writing was excessively descriptive; the plot was plodding.
2,Okay....,"This is definitely not my favorite book. I just don't get it! I had to read it in school and was totally bored. The last two chapters were better, however. The whole Hepzibah and Judge Pyncheon thing are just so boring. Hawthorne goes off in HUGE explanations for EVERYTHING. There are much better works of literature in this world (a.k.a. Christy, Little Women, Stargirl)"
4,Beautiful writing,"This beautifully written book reads slowly, because the complex sentences & original thoughts require time to digest & enjoy. So, I choose my reading time carefully, when I'll stay alert & concentrate enough to get it the first time."
4,Great--for fans of Hawthorne classics!,"This is another good Hawthorne book. It builds the charactersdescriptively so your mind's eye is there. It gives a peakof how things were in that era. Written in his usual,exquisite, expressive use of the English language."
3,It was a little difficult to understand.,"I'm 15 years old and I read this book as an independent study for English. It was a little difficult to get into this book because Nathanial Hawthorne is a very descriptive writer. But once I got to about the middle of the book and the plot picked up, I had to say it was hard to put it down. All in all, it was a decent book."
3,"This book was difficult at times, but in the end is worth it","After reading The House of the Seven Gables, I think that it is a decent book to read. I would not recommend it for younger teenagers because of the fact that the language is so descriptive and at times difficult to understand. Throughout the book, I found myself picking up a dictionary to find out what certain terms meant. At times I found it annoying because I did not understand all of the meanings, but then you have to remember that Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote this book in 1851. During the beginning of the book, I would find myself reading, and as I got down to the bottom of a page, I would realize I had no idea what I had just read. The book was dull and boring at times, but the plot was rather interesting to me. Although The House of Seven Gables was difficult at times, in the end it was worth reading."
1,Big on Words.. Small on Plot,"If you're into action, suspense, comedy, humor, violence, excitement, or anything else normal people like, then DO NOT read this book. It has a very slow moving plot, that does not do anything for anyone. This book could have been condensed to 3 pages, instead of its novel size, because the plot has so few events. Perhaps it was a fine novel back when it was written, but it was a bit too ""lugubrious"" for me. The bottom line is this: if you are suffering from insomnia, I would recommend this book, because it will put you right to sleep. One more thing.. I gave it one star, but if I really had a choice it would receive zero stars.. and even zero would be more than generous."
1,do not read this book,"this book is horrible, it is too long, confusing and just flat out ""sux"" i dont recomend this book to any one, and for those who like it, I cannot agree. this book is a wast of time, words, presious life and trees. do not support this books production!"
4,"Not a cheerful book, but beautifully written","At first I felt the characters were too gloomy for my taste and it took some effort to keep reading. Hawthorne's writing style kept me going because it is so clearly descriptive that I felt I was experiencing the story (creepy as it was at times). When the young relative was introduced into the story, it gained momentum and I was hooked. I can see where the story would hold little interest for teenagers and is better suited for more mature readers, but I certainly can see why this book has been around for 150 years."
2,Less than enchanting.,"I remember enjoying this old classic as a teenager. But compared to current novels, I found it less than enchanting. Very little action. Very little dialogue. Lots and lots of philosophizing by the author."
4,A Classic of American Fiction,Hawthorne's work is a creepy classic -- one of the most interesting books to emerge from an entirely different era of American letters.
4,"Thoughtful, intriguing SF; flat characters.","This is A.E. Van Vogt at his best, with the story of a major exploratory expedition and a young practitioner of a newly-developed science called Nexialism on board. Nexialism undertakes to combine the knowledges of the various branches of science and make something than is more than the sum of the parts, and Van Vogt provides an extremely cleverly-drawn summary of how this works under fire. As with several of his other books, its insight into social science is penetrating and original. The only minor drawback is the relatively two-dimensional characters, a feature quite common in older SF. But Van Vogt keeps the action coming and the narrative direct and absorbing. Even his not-so-great novels hold the reader's interest, and here he is in top form."
1,"These stories are not a novel, not new and not his best","If you've read Van Vogt's stories, you've read the best of these 5 stories before. They've taken some Beagle stories, added the worst of Van Vogt as padding, and republished it in a gorgeous package. But that doesn't change the fact that it's not a novel, not new and not nearly his best. Just know what you're getting before you buy."
4,Good quick read,"Short book that has a good moral. The writing style is very dated, and may be a turn off to some (it almost was for me).You can read the whole book in under an hour, and will definitely find a way to apply it immediately."
1,Deceptive Description,"I have no fault with the story ""The Go-Getter."" However, I fault the publisher and Amazon for their misleading description of this particular edition. In addition to ""The Go-Getter"" it also includes a dense, unrelated scientific article about magnetism by a gentleman named Edward Leedskalnin. This other text occupies the first half of the book. This makes it useless for giving as a motivational gift.I would recommend looking for a copy of the original text elsewhere."
2,Really Not That Good,After reading all of the positive reviews I downloaded this book onto my Kindle and read it. It is written in a language that was spoken many decades ago which makes it hard to read and sometimes understand. It is not really all that motiviting. I think you are going to be dissapointed with the story and the book.
1,I get the premise but....,"I have to say that most people I know after being sent on the blue vase hunt would’ve done one of two things: 1) Decided that the company is full of a bunch of South ends of North bound donkeys or 2) Went back and pummeled the pinheads. I’ve been involved in challenges in my life that were far more serious than what this book describes, and I have to say all this book highlights is how to be a weasel to get what you want. We have too much of that in the country already. In summary, even though I like most of what Dave Ramsey recommends for reading, on this one I was far from impressed."
5,Motivational Power for Team Building,I purchased 10 copies of this story for my leadership team as a source of inspiration as we go through our peak holiday season. It has helped to drive home that focus on customer experience that my company holds so very dear. The Go-Getter is truly a timeless story and delivering the blue vase is what customer obsession is all about.
4,Tenacious pursuit,This book really highlights a get the job done spirit and passion. It demonstrates what leaders are looking for in other potential leaders. It is a great book to read and well worth your time.
5,"it's not what you've got, it's what you *do* with it!","It took me a few times to read the first chapter--I kept saying ""huh?"" (a weird opening) then finally got into it. Some of the best books start this way!DON'T QUIT IN DISGRACE ACE, FACE THE VASE!Greg ""failing forward on my way to success"" Rebuck"
5,Very Stimulating,Mr. Peck's attitude is the greatest point he never quits. Young people today need to learn from the attitude of Mr.Peck. This world today is competative and Mr. Peck shows a CAN DO attitude. He demonstrated that one must win the person first to gain there confidence. Easy reading and quick. Excellent book recommend it to everyone!!!
5,Truly Inspiring,"I usually don't take time to review products, but I decided to make an exception.The book is short, I read it in about an hour. As a 25 y-o with a huge goal in sight, this book reoriented my thought pattern in terms of purpose and persistence. You see, I came to realize I came into this world with far more advantage than I ever imagined. This book brought me to think that it is my responsibility to develop and leverage my faculties in to attain my goal....."
4,"Be the ""go-getter""","Good simple book which endorses the never say die attitude of ""just do it"" - after all, it is in your hands"
4,Great sales training.,This book shows the reality of what sales is all about -determination! Great example of how to make things happen.
4,Loved the short fast paced and helpful read,"There is a lot in the beginning of the book that is not needed, but overall it is a wonderful story and a fun read. I would recommend it to any business person."
5,real life,i personaly heard of a story of the same plot.seems employers are still doing this to test employees.
2,By the pink-toed prophet...,"...I really didn't like this book. I read alot of the success/motivational type books (see my reviews of various Brian Tracy books, for example) but I really had a hard time with this book. The constant character catchphrases (see the title of this review), the ""harrumphs"", and I really thought the whole blue vase thing was kind of dumb. Why not give the poor guy a test that might actually enhance the company's bottomline, rather than tempt him to break a window in order to steal A STUPID BLUE VASE THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE? Why not send him after an impossible to get customer or something?At least it was better than ""Who Moved My Cheese?"""
1,Sorry but I don't get it,"I just don't get it. Its a quick read, read the whole thing in an hour or so. People are saying its one of the best books ever - agree to disagree. Sorry, but I got nothing out of it. Spoiler alert: its a story about an ex soldier who persistently applies for a job. Gets the job and is giving some fake ridiculous challenge to test how good he is. He meets the challenge, not thru anything extremely clever but thru some persistence. As another reviewer mentioned, several times thru the story he threatens violence - so the character loses the personable appeal you'd hope for a protagonist. The end. I dont get it. I didn't feel inspired or motivated or challenged to become such a go-getter. A waste of time to read."
1,Waste of time and money. Garbage,"I own hundreds of self help and business books. This is probably the worst I have ever read.Absolute drivel. Someones repackaging of an out of copyright book, cheaply printed and foisted on the public.Get a free copy on the web or read any other book but do not waste time on this one."
1,Convoluted!!! Don't Waste Your Time...,This book was honestly the worst book I have ever tried to read. HORRIBLE!
5,A Short Story Of Inspiration and Perspiration,"The book, ""The Go Getter"", is a relatively short story about being persistent and getting the job done. It is nice that the setting is in San Francisco since it is one of my favorite cities. Although many of the expressions and language used seems antiquated, the principles are relevant and meaningful.What does it take to be a Go Getter? Read the book a few times and pick up on the lessons and principles.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, ""Nanay: Lessons from a Mother"""
4,The Go-Getter,"This little book by Peter Kyne was written in 1921. It is interesting to read something written nearly 90 years ago and find some much that makes sense today. It is the story of an employee who is tested by his employer who gives him an impossible task just to see the mettle he is made of.My favorite quote is, ""...esprit de corps doesn't bubble up from the bottom. It filters down from the top. An organization is what its commanding officer is--neither better nor worse."" Some things never change. I have seen this principle play out again and again in schools.I think a few more Go-Getters in the world will make it a better place to be. Approaching difficult tasks with the attitude ""it shall be done"" is a whole lot more refreshing than all of the excuse making we commonly see today.Be a Go-Getter."
5,Never Give Up!,Great book for encouragement to keep going and never give up especially when it seems that all the chips are down and it's time to throw in the towel. Seek alternate creative ways to accomplish the mission. This was totally amazing.
4,The Go-Getter,"I've read this book many times over the years, and have bought copies for friends. It's a great gift - and a great book to read again from time to time. What will you do to reach your goals? What will you allow to stand in your way? Will you quit when the going gets tough?"
4,Helaing sound,I found this a lovely healing sound. I liked the precussion that is both lively and soothing.
2,OK,"I love the Byrds and Gene Clark and this is supposed to be his Sargent Peppers, but it is just disjointed and almost boring. I really can't stand the chorus in the background on some of the songs. The overproduction is just not necessary and it distracts from the songs. Gene deserved better."
3,Tale of two CD's,"The newly remastered and expanded CD is a tale of two different styles. The original is overproduced with silly backup singers; over instumentation etc; But wait! the bonus tracks included (7) save this CD! This is what sounds like the post-Byrds country movement, the melodies stand out much better and the acoustic work is better appreciated. This should have been the first release. Overall not too bad, but far from anything Chris HIllman has done."
5,This Byrd Never Flew Higher,"Maybe it was the copious amounts of drugs consumed during recording, maybe it was the endless budget, maybe the influence of the producer Thomas Jefferson ""Madman"" Kaye, or maybe just the enormity of the talent packed between the grooves, but No Other is truly Gene Clark's masterpiece. In it, he is mystical, beautiful, spiritual, moving, funny, dramatic, tuneful, spare, overwrought (I could go on, but that's just the first song!) Spare further reading and considering whether you should purchase or not, this is a must-have for any true music fan, anyone open to the flights of boundless and visionary risk-taking in music that seems to have gone the way of bell-bottoms, mood rings and, er, Gene Clark."
5,polarizing,Gene Clark fans are split on this one: it's either bloated or a masterpiece. I fall firmly into the camp that judges this a maseterpiece. I had never heard it before purchasing 6 months or so ago. Everytime I hear it I pick up something more of Clarke's genious. if I had to be stranded on a desert island this is definitely one of the ten discs I would take with me.BTW I have not heard the 8 song version so can't compare the mastering of this expanded disc against it. But to me the disc sounds fine.Only wish I could give this more than 5 stars.
5,"Still Moved by ""No Other"" Many Years Later","Lucky for me, my older brother was a Byrds fan. While listening to his Byrds collection I began to take note of the gentlemen singing lead on a number of early Byrd songs who had a beautifully sad mournful voice. It was Gene Clark. From that moment on I began following his career right up to his untimely passing in 1991. ""No Other"" is simply stunning. It has a folk foundation that is surrounded by surreal orchestration which is brought home by Gene's sensitive vocals. ""Lifes Greatest Fool"" and ""The True One"" are beautiful while ""Lady of the North"" is breathtaking. ""Some Misunderstanding"" still delightfully challengers the listener. There is not a weak track on this CD. I wore out my LP long ago. If it were possible to wear out a CD, I would have done so already. I simply love these songs. This is a great set from a true music pioneer. Gene was indeed the ""True One""."
4,The Brutal World of Dinosaurs,"My students were studying the Mesozoic era and they really enjoyed ""New Blood"". The film is intelligent, informative and the animation is intriguing enough to keep the interest of a 7th grader. The cannibal scene might be a bit much, but I will show this film again."
5,Roar!!!,"My kids (and husband..) have watched more times than i wish to track. This is a great series though for my 4 year old, it's a bit to aggressive in a few scenes. Overall, 5 star!!!"
5,Educational and Entertaining,I bought this for my seven year old grandson who is a dinosaur addict. He was captivated and I ended up watching as well. I was amazed at the quality and have since ordered a couple of other DVD's from this BBC series. Very enjoyable and something we will watch over and over.
3,Walking with Dinosaurs,Was excpecting a little more. My son likes it but as for myself i wasnt impressed. I would have liked to have seen more.
2,Relies entirely on the yuck factor,"A very typical example (I was browsing through that book today): The book says that the Romans made a sauce called 'garum', which they used on pretty much everything, by putting a mixture of anchovies and salt in a vat. This was then let sit for several months.Sounds disgusting, doesn't it?We know all this because there are recipes in a cookbook that is ascribed to a chap called Apicius and another guy by the name of Pliny wrote a huge encyclopedia where he says brand such-and-such is best. Unfortunately the author fails to mention that.(By the way, Maggi seasoning is made by putting soybean protein and salt in a large vat and forgetting about it for several days. No fish.)Things are never put into proper perspective, presumably because the author is afraid of spoiling the fun. Science isn't fun, it isn't meant to be fun. Science demands careful thought. Science makes sense!"
4,Effortless Grace.,"Most singers have to scream from mountaintops to be heard. Others have to strategically position themselves to be taken seriously. But Maysa Leak, vocalist of the underexposed Incognito, has a grace that oozes so effortlessly, that her peers must be scrambling to wonder how she's able to do it. Her solo debut isn't going to make anyone forget about Incognito, but it's a solid album that shows that she's able to stand on her own. The disc is a mix of jazz-laced soul that never makes leaps and bounds to make a statement (heads up, Alicia Keyes) and doesn't stray too far from her past work with Incognito. Like a kite on a windy October afternoon, it soars with ease. Favorte tracks of mine are ""Black Heaven,"" ""Can We Change the World?,"" and ""Peace of Mind."" Maybe, one day, the mainstream will catch up with Maysa and find out what it has been missing for all these years."
4,garyaustin@ibm.net,"Having been a fan of most of incognito songs which maysa is highlighted, ""deep waters"", ""shade of blue"" and ""beneath the surface"" I decided to take the chance... I was not disappointed. As demonstrated on my favorite track, ""rain drops"", Maysa seemed to give a thumbs down to the large horn section in favor of smaller more musical instrumental solos. This CD also is well recorded. If I had a complaint It would be this CD tilt towards R&B, as opposed to the other incognito solo project inner shade's ""4 corners"" which has more of a jazz flavor."
4,Fascinating book,"Good, deep read. This book is fascinating! I haven't finished it yet, so I will comment more on it if I so desire once I have finished reading."
2,Not really what I was expecting,I ordered this for my husband who loves this hymn writer. I was expecting more along the line of the fanny crosby story. This dvd was pretty boring and didn't have much about the history of the actual hymns (this is what I wanted). The dvd was in the condition it was said to be in and did arrive promptly but I wouldn't really recommend it for the money.
5,New to Theosophy? Start here!,"If Madame Blavatsky writings are difficult to digest in your new exploration of Theosophy, then start with Besant. She lays it out so that you can more easily absorb the secret teaching of the mystics. Also just a great book for those who are theosophists already - just to see how Besant delineates the precepts of this fascinating line of thought."
2,biased,By reading this book one would think that most of the first class thinkers in Islamic world were either Iranian or Shia. I wonder if the author was paid by someone in that region to write this book.
2,Read It While I was Waiting . . .,"I actually read this book while I myself was waiting - in a hotel in Guatemala to meet the son I was to adopt! Like most of the other reviewers, this book was a disappointment to me. Interestingly enough, it is the first book I've ever read which was written in English, but the style makes you think it was translated from Chinese. The best part of the book is that it offers a rare view of day-to-day life in China during a terrible period. In addition, the descriptions are quite beautiful; rendered in a rich, yet delicate manner. And I was thrilled that the author made the wife out to be a decent human being, and not some shrew. However, the plot just doesn't deliver. Even though the idea of it is quite staggering -here is this man waiting for almost 20 years to marry this woman - there is really very little dramatic content. Events just happen quietly, unfolding as if you were watching clouds move in the sky. Why it won the National Book Award is beyond me."
2,overrated,"I'm afraid that Mr. Ha Jin doesn't quite know how to write good English prose. The plot, although potentially delicious in a minimalist way (the book is quite literally about waiting) is underserved by his style. There are few authors who could write sparely and get away with it, e.g. Hemingway. Not Ha Jin, mainly because he just isn't that great, but also because he hasn't even nailed basic English language usage. On page 179 Ha misuses ""bisexual"" to mean ""hermaphrodite""; on page 296 he forgets to translate the Chinese for ""idiot"" and leaves it in literal translation as ""stupid egg"". I don't really care about the exotic terrain: it isn't exotic enough to me (I'm from China and am quite familiar with life and culture under Chinese communism) to redeem the other, glaring flaws within this book. Perhaps after a few more English immersion courses Ha Jin will manage to write something that deserves the National Book Award. In the meantime don't bother reading this book."
3,Confused Characters,"Well, I was ""waiting"" for the characters to mature and find their meanings in life. I was disappointed by Lin's weak person and flakiness. He was selfish and immature his entire life. Manna acted like a silly woman with no self-respect. The only person I liked was Shuyu. At least she had some purpose in her being. The story overall was good, but the characters were unrealistic."
3,Not worthy of The National Book Award,"This was a very nice read, very peaceful, very simple. It's clear the writer's first and most natural language is not english. He writes simply but, in a way, also very rigidly. He's got a kind of formula. A little dialogue and then he sprinkles in some scene description, usually of trees.Also, positive reviewers love the phrase ""against the backdrop of communist china"" and ""you learn so much about communist china"". The truth is, you don't. His discriptions of the hospital are sketchy at best. You'll learn more in five minutes on wikipedia.This was a beach read, a little sad, a little corny, easy to swallow in a few bites. To pretend it's anything more than that is ridiculous."
3,Talk about learning a stereotype or two,"This book is definitely one of those novels where you learn quite a bit about how Chinese men view women. Although it's a love story, I think many American women would never call what this man feels LOVE. He is so much more concerned with physical beauty and what others think that he doesn't always convince you that it's true love. But regardless of his shortcomings, I think that this book gives real insight into the Chinese culture during this time and I love learning about that in particular. Another favorite of mine is Memoirs of a Geisha."
2,What A Perfect Title!!,"This title is so fitting as I ""waited"" all through this book. I ""waited"" to see where the story was going, then ""waited"" for something to happen, and ""waited"" to find a character I even liked. (I think that character must have been Shuyu as Lin was nothing but a wimp and Manna needed to ""get a life""). Then I couldn't ""wait"" to get to the end of the book!!I loved ""being in China"" and learning of how it must have been during the cultural revolution, but as for the rest of the story........DISAPPOINTED......"
2,Waiting...for What?,"The novel was a huge disappointment. Dramatically overrated by the critics and tough to slog through, despite the relatively easy writing style. I didn't warm to any of the characters and ultimately found myself just reading for plot, to see when their waiting, and mind, would be over."
2,Waiting,"I am an avid reader who usually reads very rapidly, but I had to slog my way through this book. I am astounded that it won the National Book Award. I did not find it ""well-written"". In fact, I frequently found the sentence construction awkward. I agree with one reviewer who found it ""bland""--I found it both bland and ponderous. There is only one likeable character in the whole book and that is Shuyu. It does provide an interesting insight on life in China in the latter part of the 20th century, but for me this book does not compare with a book such as Tsukiyama's ""The Samurai's Garden"". Different books for different folks..."
3,"""waiting"" sums it up","Waiting is an interesting view into archaic although recent Chinese society. It's pretty slow going and the reader is left waiting for something to happen for the main characters the first third of the book. Things do get interesting towards the end, however by then I wasn't rooting for them anymore."
3,Overrated but interesting,"I liked the book for the first 200 pages, then began wondering what the fuss was all about. It was an interesting study on Chinese culture and mores. I liked the characters, but felt the last 1/3 of the book was disappointing, especially the ending. The characters themselves were intriguing, but the plot could use some development."
2,Not for me,I tried but there was not enought plot for me. The author drew the characters very well. I also liked the atmosphere of the story but in the end I was bored.
4,The title of the book says it all,"In this book, I did spend a lot of time waiting. Waiting for something to happen... I turned each page anticipating the next big event, but much to my surprise there was no big exciting event. Then I realized, this is what life was like in communist China. People lived their lives following all the rules and waited for their chance at happiness. Problem is, they never found that happiness. This is not to say they were unhappy, they just always wanted more. At first I really did not like this book, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized the author did an amazing job of getting me to feel the emotions of the characters."
5,Magical,"I hope readers will ignore--and manage to forgive--the profound stupidity displayed by the last two readers. What is exquisite and understated about Ha Jin's beautiful novel will be lost on those expecting the equivalent of Jurassic Park and Terminator 3. This novel operates on a very different level, with a different sense of time and plot development. If you're genuinely interested in reading about another culture, and prepared to give this book the time and attention it deserves, Ha Jin's novel really is a magical piece of writing."
1,trite and disappointing,"I am not sure why this is called a love story, since Lin, by his own admission, has never been in love. He finds the true details of love intrusive and is actually looking for maid and laundry service. The language of the book is extremely uneven. The narration is sometimes lovely, sometimes archaic (they copulated a long time.) while the conversation is full of jarring Americanish colloquialisms (Girl, you're crazy!) which do not fit the characters or events. The omnipresent voice couldn't be a more overused device. Lin's stilted conversations with 'the voice' was like being hit over the head with the obvious. Ultimately, this is a dreary book about a self-centered man who only wants what he doesn't have and the two women who, for reasons never understood, love him."
2,Ordinary,"I seem to be the only reader on earth at the moment who found this novel bland and bloodless. It does offer a rich look at China in a historical time and place, but so would a good history book. Jin's been compared to Henry James, which means that no one has read Henry James lately. Ordinary, dull sentences, wooden dialogue, and irritating characters. Certainly there were more compelling reads available to the National Book Award jury?"
5,Delicate and fascinating,"I believe I can understand the negative comments this book has received, but I do not agree with them. Having several Asian friends, I was fascinated by the glimpse into Chinese culture--not only the political landscape, but family relations. I think people may be expecting something more grandiose from this book since it is an award winner. Rather, this book is like its main character, subtle. The narrative is straight forward, and the story is literally about ""waiting,"" waiting for a period in your life to begin. I think what this book gives us, besides a wonderful peek into Chinese society, is a lesson to find what we love in life and revel in it. This is not a book to ""polish off quickly."" Rather it is one to read and think about each word, and the way those words are presented. I loved it. I finished the book several weeks ago, and I still think of Lin, and wonder if he will ever really know happiness."
1,Boring and stilted writing,"I don't understand why this book won any awards. I found the main character to be an irritatingly passive male about whom I cared little. The only reason I kept reading was to see if anything turned up that made it worthwhile. I would have to say, no. Furthermore, the writing seems stilted and elementary -- like a very poor translation."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"This is a terribly slow tale filled with dispassionate characters. Everything about the story and characters is bland. It is story of 18 years where nothing changes. If you are looking for a simple, yet elegant, story, pass Waiting by. It missed the mark. Go read Shipping News."
4,Oh the humanity...,"I find it interesting that so many of the previous reviews of this book focus on the constraints a Communist society places on relationships. To me, the message was more about the tendancy for people to be disatisfied with what they have, never being fully happy in the moment. By always waiting for things to improve we can take the focus off how we are feeling in the moment and instead focus on how things will always be better in the future. Without gving anything away, let me say that I belive the end to this book demonstrates this perfectly.In conclusion, I enjoyed this book becuase it operated on a number of levels. It not only delivered a message about oppresive politcal systems, but also one about the basic defects of human nature."
5,stunning,"I stayed up until 3 am reading this novel. When I was done, I got up and started cursing and shaking my head: I couldn't believe it. It was so beautiful I wanted to cry. The sustained and meditative style of _Waiting_ is quite different than his other works, which can be quite bleak. But this novel is utterly, utterly beautiful. Haven't read a book this good since Kazuo Ishiguro's _Remains of the Day_."
4,Trying to please everyone never works !,"Rarely will you find a novel like ""Waiting"". It is simple, yet has a powerful message in it that does not reveal itself until the very end. Lin Kong, the key character in it, endeavors to do everything to honor the Chinese political system of 1960-80's, his medical career and his first marriage. He also allows true love to wait ! ""Wait"" being the operative word. The result of such ""waiting"" is what the reader must read on for. It is not what we normally find it to be.It may make you ponder some of your own life decisions.I recommend this book for those with an interest in socio-political issues in an Asian culture."
4,An Old Wine in the New Bottle,"Realistic,detailed description of the people and events occurred in the Mao`s age makes me reminiscent of the days spent in China.The content of the story is nothing original to the Chinese who are over 30 years old.However,the story is still attractive to alien readers who are not so familiar with the background of Culture Revolution.The totalitarianism,the puritan discipline,the serfdom to obey. what I admire most in Ha Jin is his courage to write in an entirely new language with such fluency,confidence and clearness.Is`nt it a miracle!"
3,Spare and elegant...NOT!,"Because I love writing which is (truly) ""spare and elegant,"" it irritates me to see this phrase so blithely thrown around--such as by many of the reviewers of this decent, but not great, novel. Many of Jin's descriptions of the natural surroundings (in the city and in his home village) are, indeed, spare and elegant. Where Jin gets into trouble is in describing his characters' thoughts and actions. In these sections, his writing is often klunky and melodramatic. If you want truly spare and elegant (and great) writing, try Ron Hansen, Cormac McCarthy, or Michael Ondaatje. And, as for reading about Chinese culture, I'll take Amy Tan any day."
3,good but not great,"A love story set in China, involving two people who have waited 18 years to be together, is bound to be intriguing. And the first half of the book was. Ha Jin did a good job of setting a backdrop but the psychological aspects of the main characters, Lin Kong and Manna Wu, left something to be desired. I wanted to feel more sympathy towards these two, and the fact that I didn't means that Jin wasn't completely successful. I also thought the book was somewhat choppy, which made me frustrated. And the ending was anti-climactic and I kept wondering if I was missing something. I don't understand why this won the National Book Award. There were lots of problems with the narrative and the flow and I'm sure there were other books out there more deserving."
3,Author's answer,"Years ago, I went to a presentation of this wonderful book by its author at Powells' Books Store in Portland, Oregon. I was shocked at his response to a question from the audience about the validity/possibility of the plot in China. He replied that his book was written strictly for Westerners and their romantic ideals. That this story could never happen in China. That remark hurt my impresion of this book."
3,A Reader's Wait,"Waiting is an extraordinarily annoying, yet suspensful read. The author makes the reader wait to find out if the new relationship will outshine the hollow relationship that Lin Kong had with his wife Shuyu. The ending makes the drawn out sequence of events -- in which Lin Kong travels back to his home town each year to divorce his wife and fails -- worth the wait.The book is not just about love and arranged marriage, like the cyclical events appear to imply. The book is about a man's struggle to realize who he is, what he desires, and how long he has waited to find it. Though Lin Kong's girlfriend, Manna Wu, waits for decades before she can marry Lin Kong, her wait is inconsequential. Shuyu waits for her husband to return to her and Lin kong is waiting for realization, contentment, and home.The book's ending is one surprise you won't mind waiting for."
3,Like watching trees grow,"I'm confused, like those who gave the book both good and bad reviews, as to why this story merited the National Book Award. I think that raised my expectations too much, because while I liked the idea behind the story, I found the writing to be slightly ponderous. The passage of 18 years is supposed to happen to the characters, not to the reader."
1,National Book Award???,"Perhaps the reason I didn't like this book is that I'm Chinese, or that I bought it after reading Golden's ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" which I thought was lyrical. The prose style here is wooden, as if the author were trying to sound ""translated"". The narrative style seemed to me bureaucratic; again, this may have been the writer's intention, but it seemed ultimately clumsy. The characters were almost caricatures; given other reviews, perhaps they were exotic, but they didn't engage me at all. Even the metaphorical political and environmental ambiance seemed mechanical. National Book and PEN award winner???"
2,Not worth the WAIT,"Although this took place in China, there was none of the flavor of the country. A very shallow, rather spineless man cannot obtain a divorce from his wife for many years. When he finally does, he lives the addage, ""Be careful what you wish for"". It was adult subject matter, but written on a 6th grade level. I was truly disappointed in this book."
2,No challenges here.,"I found this book highly disappointing, both as a result of its colorless prose and endless hammering of ""truths"" that, in a society obsessed with self-help, are already part of our collective consciousness. OF COURSE obstacles make romance more attractive. OF COURSE relationships begin reflexively. OF COURSE people are often unable to see themselves with enough clarity to undo self-damage. OF COURSE communism is a hypocritical construct.Waiting offers little enlightenment, no subtlety, and a complete absence of reward for the insightful reader. This text is as bland and pointless as its characters."
2,Don't waste your time on this,"I bought this book because of all the awards it received but never will I make the same mistake again! Not only is the story dull, boring, the characters silly, but even the writing style is poor.The only reason why I gave the book 2 stars is because it gave me some idea abt the Cultural Revolution in China and its impact on ppl's lives."
4,A unique look at the virtue of patience.,"I was not impressed by the initial chapters of the book but, like its theme, my patience was rewarded in spades. Ha Jin's writing is simple and schoolboyish at times, not what I would expect from a prize-winning effort. However, it is quite apt for this tale of simple unambitious characters from the heartlands of China caught in the thick of the country's evolution into capitalism. It is to Ha Jin's credit that the waiting is as frustrating for the reader as it is for Manna. The beauty of the novel lies in the underlying themes of the rapid changes in China and how it eventually drives home to even a most loyal follower like Lin Kong. The final chapters where Lin Kong finally realises how he lost 17-years of his life trying to marry the woman he thought he loved and missed the growing years of his daughter, completely blind to the devotion of his duty-bound wife, is simply heartbreaking. This book is a little gem that's worth the wait."
3,Very Interesting Read,"I ""read"" this book on audio, and at times I thought how interesting the book was, and at times I was bored. The last third of the book was definitely the best. It was hard to be sympathetic to any of the characters except Shuyu, the dutiful wife. I felt very sorry for her. Lin Kong, the absent husband was a very weak man, with no passion in his life for anyone or anything. At times I was angry with the characters, at times (a few), I felt sorry for them, and at times I was disgusted with them. However, they were real people, with all the faults that go along with being human. Perhaps what I liked best about the book was its description of communist China. It is hard not to have a morbid fascination with the country. The culture is so completely, totally different from American culture; it is hard to fathom living in a country in which the individual simply has no value as an individual. It is definitely one of the books that will stick with me a while."
4,Heartbreaking...,"I also read this book immediately after Arthur Golden's ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" and agree that the writing styles are in stark contrast to one another. But the point is not to be ""lyrical,"" as the other reviewer suggests.I found myself transported, each chapter moving slowly but purposefully to the next.Although the narrative seemed to drag a bit in places, Ha Jin's light touch lends the story a subtle urging throughout. Despite the pity you feel for Lin's faithful but unloved wife, the longing between Lin and Manna is heartbreaking, lingering on for years while circumstances keep them at arm's length from one another. Some might call the ending anti-climactic, but I thought it only made the story stronger and all the more compelling."
3,Slow beginning but worth the wait.,"I was excited to read this National Book Award winner, but wow, did it start slowly. The first two parts of the book are tedious and depressing, but once the third part begins, the author shows us why he is so acclaimed. This is definitely a book that sticks in your head after you finish it.I often wanted to kick some sense and emotion in to the head of the main character, Lin, and finally realized this is exactly what the author wants the reader to feel. The book was a great insight in to people living their life as tools in a restrictive society."
1,"Instead of reading ""Waiting,"" I should have repeated:","""The grass is always greener on the other side"" or ""Be careful what you wish for because you might just get it."" While ""Waiting"" may be a triumph of well-written English prose by a person who is not a native speaker, its pace is coma-inducing slow for many of us. Years and years go by and nothing happens. This is not a book for those seeking a lively and interesting plot. It's better suited for the reader who likes to savor a line or a paragraph, dissecting it while relishing the word play."
4,???,"Am I the only one here who reads Lin as a gay man who can't come to terms with his sexuality and therefore deep down wants to WAIT, to keep everyone WAITING so he won't have go one step closer to facing up to the fact that he's gay?Or does everyone insist on reading Ha Jin's book as an allegory of communist failings, you know, your typical USA is number one political readings that so many arrogant and selfrighteous liberal Americans are so good at. Or better yet, a collection of vignettes of exotic China."
1,what's all the hype about on this one?,"I found this book -- written at the sixth grade level, according to my analysis -- to be highly overrated by the critics. I can't believe that this simplistic, boring novel received the prizes that it has. Reminds me of ""Snow falling on cedars"" and ""Shipping news,"" neither of which impressed me at all."
2,Not worth the wait!,"Despite the somewhat interesting view into Chinese culture in regards to marriage and relationships, I thought this book was very slow-moving and very disappointing. The ""plot"" never thickened - and the characters plodded through years of waiting while remaining uninteresting and predictable. I myself waited and waited to get caught up in the story - but only landed up waiting for it to be over!"
2,"Waiting, Indeed!","This book lives up to its title. I was waiting the entire time for something to happen! While the ending is interesting, the book drags unbelievably on its way there. The character of the wife is a particularly interesting one---whom we do not really get to know until the last tenth of the book! The National Book Award is a real puzzle.Try it at your own risk. For me, it wasn't worth the time put into it."
1,Tired of Waiting,This was a very slow book for me. I wouldn't recommend it. The plot seemed to lack the complexity necessary to hold my interest. The plot seemed redundant covering the same ground each year as he went back to try to convince his wife to divorse him. The only reason I finished the book was because it annoys me to buy a book and not finish it. And The Ladies of the Club is the only one on my shelf not read.
3,Maybe I waited too long,"This book has been on my list of ""mean to read that one"" since it was first published. I finally got around to it this week, and maybe I'd set myself up for disappointment by having my hopes so high. I WANTED to love this book, but I just didn't. I kept feeling like I was on the verge of really falling in love with the novel and that, with each page turned, I would be closer to having my breath taken away. Instead, with each page turned, I grew more frustrated to discover that I wasn't getting any closer to the character's hearts. I have a feeling that if the book had been written entirely from the points of views of the two women, I would have enjoyed it more."
1,CC from NJ,"The book began well, but after awhile I became annoyed with the main characters. There is just so much ""waiting"" a reader can put up with before you decide to move on (which is what the characters should have done before the middle of the book)."
2,Surprisingly awkward,"I bought this novel expecting and wanting to love it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by both the style and substance. Although the prose sometimes achieved elegance, it was frequently clumsy and obvious, especially when the author attempted to flesh out the personality and thoughts of the characters. Perhaps this was because the author was attempting to show how simple and callow the characters were, but I don't think so. Also, I found myself bored with the shallow and obvious treatment of some of the major themes - city vs. country, modern vs. traditional, capitalist vs. communist. The structure is good, the author's heart is in the right place, but the execution is clumsy and disappointing."
3,A fundamental flaw,"When you write a novel about waiting, about the long sense of one's being suspended in anticipation of something that may happen and change everything, you inevitably try to incorporate the sense of dead time.Unfortunately, if you do this successfully, what you get is a very boring reading experience.Ha Jin is a skillful creator of character and setting. The reader breathes with the characters, sees what they see and feels what they feel. But his deadly accurate replication of the waiting experience will yield for many readers a deadening read.--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The andbang BANG: A Novel ISBN 9781601640005"
1,Kept Waiting,"I read 3-4 books per month and I kept waiting for Waiting to speak to me. I thought the novel dull, depressing, not realistic and worst of all did not teach me about revolutionary China other than through the wimpy characters suppression."
1,Waiting,I struggled through the entire book. Lack-luster. Boring. I wouldn't have given this any stars if I could have gotten away with it. I don't recommend this book at all.
1,"I really disliked this book, but read it anyway.","I rarely read a book that I dislike--all the way through to the end. But this one I did--partially, because of frustration at having bought it,partially because I couldn't believe there wasn't some gem hidden in it somewhere. It was true to it's title--I WAITED, all the way through, for it to become something I would value having read. It was essentially a passionless story about a very dull life, and though it was instructive about the difficult nature of existing in post-Cultural Revolution China, it lacked any real sense of the uniqueness of the land. It was a literary white-wash, which may be of scholarly significance, but it was of no interest as a satisfying read."
2,pretty awful,"The only thing of value in this book is the background--China and the way things worked or didn't work in that country before and after Mao. But even that becomes tedious. The characters are about as interesting as stacked wood because wooden is what they are. You learn nothing about them from the way they act or speak. Everything is developed through questions they ask themselves and similar techniques that would earn a ""C"" in a college writing course. I think the author's background is what won him the award--not the book. After all it is chic of us to heap such honor on a recent arrival to our country. Nothing against that at all but lets be honest about it."
2,SO depressing,"Waiting is not something that I personally do well. ""Waiting"" the novel made me want to scream! It was so terribly dark and depressing, I am surprised that I finished it at all. It just felt incredibly static that year after year the divorce doesn't happen."
5,Trimmer,As a hairstylist Im always lookink for good equipt! This trimmer is fantastic...best one I've owned! Plus u can't beat the price!
5,chrissy,"i received it two days ago ,the item was beautiful it goes very nice with my pendent.thanks amazon"
5,Fabulous Chair!,This is the best chair I have ever sat in. I can actually lean back and rest for a 10 or 15 minute nap in a posture perfect position
5,Aeron Chair by Herman Miller,It was a gift long awaited by my husband and was a total surprise for him. He loves the chair and can't believe he waited to receive it as a gift as it is so comfortable. He says he didn't realize how bad his posture while sitting at his desk was until this chair. I opted for the adjustable chair with lumbar pad and both options are worth the extra cost.
1,Worst chair I ever had to use,"I had to use one of these chairs when working at a large game company, it has two major problems. First, the mesh blocks air circulation while pressing firmly against your skin causing excessive sweating and soreness, something a foam padded chair does not do. Second, the plastic seat surround that the mesh affixes to presses in against the thighs unless you're anorexic with bony legs, this causes extreme discomfort within 20 minutes. I would constanly have to readjust how I was sitting in the chair, switching from sitting primarily on one thigh then the next to keep the blood flowing in my legs.I'm lucky I didn't die of a blood clot due to having to use one of these chairs."
3,Overpriced,"Nice chair, wasn't worth the price-tag. Bought it in an attempt to help alleviate back-pain from sitting at a desk all day. Returned it the next day and bought a $16 exercise ball to sit on, which worked wonderfully and saved me $800."
1,Price does not always get you the best,"I paid the close this absurd price for this chair b/c of the reviews and b/c I have to spend lots of time in it. Within months the pneumatic device started failing. Today it failed completely. The closest location to make the repairs needed - replacing the device - is about 30 miles from my home and will cost about $100 plus labor. There are many excellent office/desk chairs on the market now and with the economy what it is, it is absolutely not necessary to spend this kind of money and doubly so, when you will have to pay 15% of the original price of the chair to get it fixed. I will spend little more than that and get a new chair. Note to Herman Miller: There are few businesses around that will spend this kind of money for your chair. You may want to re-think your after purchase customer service."
3,Nice chair but two problems.,"I have been using my new Herman Miller Aeron Chair Medium Lumbar support chair, for one week. I have only two criticisms. The first is the price, but of course I knew about this before I purchased it. I got it because I needed a comfortable chair for my bad back. In this respect it was probably worth the price. My major problem is that the center post only gives about 1/8 inch clearance from the floor with the standard casters. These casters are suppose to be good for commercial carpeting. However, I found that they do rub against my home carpet. This carpet is not a deep pile carpet. Take a look at the photos shown on the web and you will see what I mean. I'm told I would have to order 3 inch casters to raise the chair so the center post gives a 1/2 clearance. In the meantime I am now using a chair mat to protect my rug but even this gives a very small clearance from the mat. You would think they would have designed a higher level center post."
3,Weird descriptor,I bought these for my 9 year old who was a cat in the school production of CATS. They worked just fine. There's nothing inherently sexy about the gloves. They're pink and fluffy.
2,Eh.....,"I'm forced to agree with disclaimer777 on this one. But I'd go for a double cheeseburger, myself... or if I were in Cali. then maybe some Carls JR! Either way, it seems that TR is getting lazy. Although this one isn't quite as bad as Head like a Hole [US Version], it's pretty close. ""The Hand that Feeds"" is just an ""eh..."" song, and it comes with an ""eh.."" remix. Overall, I suppose that would make this an ""eh..."" single. For the casual NIN fan, I would suggest you just skip the single and buy[WITH_TEETH] when it comes out or one of the earlier albums instead. But if you're like me, and have to have it all, then I guess you'll just have to get it, won't you?"
1,Don't Kid yourself into this purchase,"I made fun of my best friend so badly when he bought it. Honestly, I gave it a chance. We opened it and listened to it for the first time together. But halfway through the worst remix ever crafted by man, it was clear, that I would be making fun of him for his poor purchasing decision, for months to come. This is the worst remix every created. It is long and drawn out and has no merit or quality to it. Don't fool yourself into buying something you will never listen to and will hide from your friends."
5,NIN is back,Great mixWith Teeth is insaine..trent reznor is back and almost better then ever (TDS is the best)
1,a total disappointment,"wow. this is the first time ive ever been disapointed with nine inch nails. this is the weakest song ive ever heard. i love every other album and single before the hand that feeds and the new album with teeth. the single is a very boring lame song. its like that boring 80s wanna be new new wave music, just a little more extra keyboards. the disc itself is disappointing because it was supposed to come enhanced with the video for the song. the video for the song is the only interesting thing about the song. also the fact that the cd is only available as an import and the vinyls for the singles are also imports. there is also a collectors box to hold the vinyls that is only available in the uk and is limited to 2000 boxes individually numbered. hopefully the next album wich is supposed to come out much quicker than previous releases will be the nine inch nails album that we deserve."
3,Good choice for new single...,"However its not typical NIN. Trent obviously wanted something catchy so the kids would be like ""OH BOY ITS NIN TIME AGAIN"".Sorry Trent, you lose points in the creative department.However you gain points for making this so catchy that it never seems to get old.But you lose points again for 2 crappy remixes.All in all, decent song, bad remixes = okay single."
3,So-so new single from Trent and co.,"Like a previous reviewer stated, ""The Hand That Feeds"" is one of the weaker choices for a single, and the disc itself is sadly rather lacking. The song itself is typical Nine Inch Nails, albeit a bit poppier sounding. However, there were better choices for a single on the upcoming ""With Teeth"" which would have served better, but the real disappointment here are the remixes. The ""Straight Mix"" sounds almost identical to the regular version that you are hearing all over the radio right now, while the ""Dub Mix"" is just plain boring and outstays it's welcome after the first three to five minutes. ""The Hand That Feeds"" is sadly, a disappointing addition to the NIN singles catalogue, but hopefully ""With Teeth"" will prove to be worth the long wait since 1999's ""The Fragile"". Halo collectors will no doubt snatch this up, but don't get your hopes up too high."
4,I enjoy the remixes better than the actual song...,"This song should have been more house oriented in the first place. Although the original isnt bad, Photek funked it up."
1,terrible,"i've been a NIN fin since spring 1990. PHM, broken and TDS are absolutely pure genius. but unfortunately NIN is dead. this song is terrible and remix worse."
4,"Halo 18, A nice Appetizer for the new album.","Halo 18 is very good overall. This song is the most audience friendly tune Trent has produced in a while. That is to say, most people will like it the first or second time listening.By the way, there are only 3 tracks on the album. #4 the video or whatever isn't included. So dont get your hopes up.The two remixes are very similiar to the original song. Not the best remixes but not bad either.But if youre like me, desperate for any new Nine Inch Nails songs, this will do nicely until the full album is released.Also, in case youre interested, the Japanese release of With Teeth will have 3 bonus tracks on it.Im out..."
2,Well Written But...,"...ultimately alienating. I understand that the author leans to the left, but I as a conservative read many, many works from liberal authors...and none leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. It's his right to write as he pleases, but in the future I will steer clear of his stuff."
3,Phone is Inactive While In Charger,Be aware that the phone is NOT operational when using the desktop charger! (You won't receive incoming calls.) The portable charger (AC or 12VDC) does allow the phone to be used (send and receive) while charging.
3,Beware - not much here,"Never assume. What you get is pretty much just what you see in the picture. There is no cord to plug this unit in. You must still use the charging cord that came with the phone to connect it to an AC outlet. As such, this cannot be used as a second charger. The only advantage is the ability to charge an extra battery along with the phone. Once you know this, it is apparent from the description, but I guess I didn't read closely enough and assumed too much. All other comments accurate."
2,Not Worth it...,"Not much to say here. My experience with the device shows it's tricky to use, easy to break, and does not do a great job of charging. Being able to charge two batteries at once -- a spare and the one on the phone -- nice. Maybe it would be more useful if it came with decent instructions."
3,'70s hits only -- beware listing,"I bought this on the grounds that it seemed to include both the early and the later stuff, as indicated by the play list; however, it turns out that track 16 (the last separately listed track on the actual record) is a single live performance that includes just a few bars from each of the songs listed on Amazon as 16-24. What's on the disc is good stuff, of course."
3,Make sure to secure the sliding sides!,"It's a wonderful product, except for the fact that the moveable sides are also moveable by my cat. He pushed one open and jumped through my two-story window. Do whatever it takes to prevent this from happening with your own cat."
4,cat veranda,"I really like this product, very sturdy and fits in the windows well. To the above poster there are two screws that are supposed to go into the sliding sides, through the perch section. If all of the directions are followed then there is no way a cat could open the side openings, unless of course they can use a screw driver.The one thing I don't like and the reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is the cat door/flap is not very tight fitting and I would like this to be a 4 season product. I will have some major drafts to deal with this winter or will have to take it down. BTW all 5 of my cats really like this product. I think I will be buying a second one."
4,A Pretty Good Album,"This wouldn't be my first choice but it has some pretty rare songs on it like ""The Relay"". It could be better if they added some real golden hits like ""My Generation"" or ""Won't Get Fooled Again"". There are some hits they you wouldn't really find on greatest hits albums. If I could, I'd disclude ""Song is Over"", ""Drowned"", and ""Had Enough"". Don't get me wrong, all those songs are great but they aren't needed on this one to make it good"
1,effing really,"the amount of time to receive the product was awesome. but received half the product, one of two disc set. no trace of our cd of set, to return the second cd and get refund, i spend more than orginally, that sucks, dissappointed."
4,***1/2 Stars,"If your a cheezy 80's child like myself and you enjoy the agonizing suspense of the weird & eerie 70's horror films such as Lets scare Jessica to death, Black Christmas, Last House on the Left ect. Then I recommend you check out this very creepy and fun throwback."
2,Horrific or Horrendous,I just finished watching this movie a few minutes ago and have to say I wouldn't care to sit through it again. It did capture the feel of an 70's or early 80's movie quite nicely but nothing happens in the first hour except for one girl getting her brains blown out by some drifter looking loser guy. The main problem with this movie is that the main character is as fidgety as a field mouse through the whole movie so it's almost a relief when she shoots herself in the head at the end of the movie. I'm sorry if I spoiled it for anybody who hasn't seen it yet but this movie is not as great as a lot of these other reviewers say. Rent is if you still want to see it. Don't waste your money on it thought because like me I bet you won't want to see it again.
1,Hated it.,"I'm a big Horror nut. I've seen all sorts of horror movies from all decades. So it's really hard for me not to like a cheesy horror movie. This movie found a way. Granted I like how it tried to pay tribute to older horror moves, but holy hell it was so SLOW! Nothing really happened for 97 % of the movie. It just dragged on and on. I was waiting for something good to happen and it didnt. Finally the last 7 minutes you see what's going on, but by then I was gone...not caring what happens by then. It's not even a good build up. Its just this girl walking around the frigging house. It's like the director had a good idea that lasts only 6 minutes so he made a movie about nothing just to get to that one scene. I will never see this again and cant believe people like this. To each their own I guess."
5,Excellent...,"Great film...this is what a horror film should be! A word to the wise though, this is most definitely a slow builder, if you are into the style of crappy fast cuts and more action than plot this is not for you, you need to have somewhat of an attention span to enjoy this, otherwise stick to the garbage they shovel to you at you local cinema."
3,"Dripping wet with atmosphere, but dry on action","High praises to Director Ti West with this excellent attempt. House of the Devil avoids current pratfalls and absurd, over-the-top rubbish that placates most new horror flicks. Thumbs up for that. This is more of a subtle, intelligent suspense story that will challenge your wits.However, it's far from perfect. This movie doesn't deliver anything very original with the premise. Another college student/babysitting type of setup. But the idea of a satanic cult touches on a sensitive nerve that is all too disturbing.But the Devil never really gets his due. This movie has solid acting, good character development, and creepy sound effects. Unfortunately, not much of a payoff for your patience. The story tiptoes along, and finally reaches a frightening bloody climax. Too bad it ends so abruptly.Overall, House of the Devil is a well told story that includes a little gore. Just not much else happening. 3.5 stars."
5,Great product,"First off, this movie is fantastic. It is simple, subtle, nostalgic, and tense. It is a everything Hatchet claimed to be, ""a return to oldschool American horror."" But unlike the worthless, talentless crap Hatchet turned out to be, House of the Devil delivers. It is not dumbed down and it never dissolves into an absurd comedy. Also, this edition is really well made. I was very impressed with both the quality and the design of the VHS. They put effort into making the VHS look old and worn, like it was purchased used right off the shelf of an old mom & pop video store. If you are going to buy this movie, I recommend picking up a copy of the VHS too, as a collector's item if nothing else."
2,A third act disaster...,"Once again a potentially great movie falls apart in the last half hour... The first hour was brilliant, but then the film degrades into one unrealistic thing after another. How did this girl so easily get out of her bindings and get away from four people standing around her. Then instead of just running out of the house, she goes to the phone!!! And the ending didn't make sense at all."
2,Skip it,"Once again I was suckered into buying movie based on positive great reviews, and once again I have to ask why anyone would rate this film more then 2 stars ? Sure it hearkens back to the 80's atmosphere and style of horror movie but that alone does not make it good. I can't believe I waste $10 bucks on this forgettable junk-don't waste yours."
1,Are you kidding me?,Hey if you want to sit down and wait for an hour for the action to start in a horror movie this is your film. After the killing and guts do take place you WONT even know why they took place. Also the killers were total sissys. Two went down in a matter of minutes being killed by a teenage girl.
2,dull,"I found that the story to this movie dragged on quite a bit.Though more realistically done than many 80's horror films, it simply lead you on until the very end.The ending was a bit sensible, I suppose, but it really just made the film more vague and less intriguing.As a horror/thriller/gore lover, I would never watch this movie again.I give it two stars to be fair, her best friend was rather enjoyable, and the only person with any brains.... at least for a while.....p.s. Though it is certainly gory! Don't say you weren't warned."
2,Tension gives way to Tedium,"This movie starts off great. The first half hour is very entertaining. There is great attention to detail in making a 70's style camp movie. Greta Gerwig's character is utterly entertaining and tension builds nicely. Then somewhere around the 30-minute mark, everything falls apart. The tension is replaced by boring, ultra-long drawn out wanderings through the hallways and rooms of the house, Greta Gerwig disappears and nothing, I mean NOTHING happens!! If they edited out about 45 minutes of the middle of this film and cut right to the chase this would be an excellent 50-minute TV scare show episode. But as it stands, it is a tedious film that tries too hard to be artsy for its own good."
2,Two stars for the 80's vibe...,"House of the Devil started out great for me. I was totally digging the 80's throwback vibe that the film had. The opening credits were fun. It was decently acted and had some interesting moments, but overall, the ending and the ""satanists worshipping in the basement"" plot felt sooooooooooo Rosemary's Baby to me for some reason. It just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.Also, I have to agree...Using Dee Wallace for about 30 seconds in a film is SUCH a waste! She is an incredible actress and a horror icon and her little cameo as ""the land-lady"" was far too thin for me."
3,BACK TO THE 80S,"Ti West takes horror viewers back to the 80s in this creepy film. The movie is slow moving by today's standards, spending lots of time focusing on Joselin Donohue's descent into the inevitable conclusion. Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov are the creepy couple who hire Donohue to ""babysit"" on the night of a total lunar eclipse--but we know there's more to it than that.Although well done, I found myself getting a little impatient waiting for the conclusion. I also found the ending a little anti-climactic. However in today's spate of torture flicks, this movie is a welcome change of pace."
1,No good at all.,This movie is terribly slow with no pay off. I disliked it so much that I am giving it poor reviews at as many websites as possible. That's how bad it is. I would not call this a homage to the 70's splatter movies. I would say it is over hyped and deserves to be in a $1 bin at Wal-mart at best.
3,This movie.,"I remember when this film came out back when i was a child in 1980. Ahh, the good old days when my belly was as flat as my wife's tits! This movie literally scared the granny panties off of everyone and their (grand)mother! I specifically remember garment-less ladies of all ages running, screaming from the theater. It's great that they've finally decided to release it out on DVD AND VHS mainly because I haven't really caught up with the times and still only have a VCR lol! I don't even have a computer! What is a computer? How am I typing this review?"
2,All atmosphere with no payoff,"This movie did an excellent job of building tension and creating an atmosphere of doom. Nothing much happens for the first hour and twenty minutes EXCEPT for the building of tension, so my opinion is based predomininantly on the last twenty minutes. Did the finale justify the wait? No - not in the least. The twist, or reveal, or what-ever you want to call it, might have been mind blowing 40 years ago, but anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of horror films could have predicted the ending just by looking at the DVD case and the film's title.I'll give the director credit for doing an excellent job of establishing mood and creating the look/feel of a '70s film, but a good horror movie also requires a plot that goes somewhere. I look forward to seeing what the director does next, but can't recommend this one."
4,ocult worship,slow burner building to a dramatic and bloody ending based on cult belief'swhich is still going on today in the U.S. and i suspect many countries
4,An Excellent Horror Film,"This film does not follow the Hollywood patterns of horror, and it's all the better for it. It has it's own unique style in today's climate of horror (while at the same time paying homage to 80s films).The House of the Devil is a film I went into with minimal expectations and I'm now debating whether it's deserving of a top 10 list for the year - it's that good. The best horror of 2009, it's a breath of fresh air in what has become a cliched and weak genre."
4,"Best ""Devil"" Movie Since The Exorcist","Wow. This movie has gotten a bad rap, and for the wrong reasons. There have been a LOT of American horror movies dealing with the ""devil"" subgenre lately, and each one has been pretty terrible. This movie is a clear exception to that trend. Yes, it starts out slow, but the suspense is almost palpable. Don't listen to those comparing it to ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Exorcist,"" both of which are in a completely different realm. The set design and, yes, even the music are very reminiscent of the 1980s. This isn't a masterpiece like ""The Exorcist,"" but it is very much worth watching. For fans of the classic, suspensful, and....wait for it..wait...ATMOSPHERIC... 1980s horror, this is a must-see!!!I know there are the usual people who would turn down a movie upon seeing the word ""atmospheric"" in a review. But, fortunately there are plenty of blood-soaked Wes Craven and John Carpenter films to satiate them."
4,Reminds me of old school horror,"I love the horror of the movies of today, but its the classics I always find myself watching. I would never have known this was made in 2009, I love the old fashion phone, cars, hair styles and most of all acting. To me if your a horror fan of all time you will certainly get this movie and like it."
2,"I appreciate the Intent, but ...","Rosemary's Baby meets the Sentinal and Burnt Offerings .... all movies I really liked. The slow burn works great in a good thriller, but in order for it to work, you need just a lil' bit more happening than happens here for a very long time. I loved the intent to make a throwback horror film, but I think this is just way too padded with ... nothing. No point at all in the opening where she finds a new apartment (but fun to see Dee Wallace(Stone))and lots of plodding scenes of sitting around. Always a hoot to see Woronov, though. This needed more of a kick-start to keep the tedium from setting in before the finale."
1,Amazon Selling Promotional Copies???,"I really like this movie but both my VHS and DVD copies arrived with deep slash marks cut in to the barcode part of the packaging!After sending it back twice for replacement orders and receiving more copies with the slash marks CUT in to them, I figured all copies from Amazon must be like this and decided to keep it anyway.This means that I was basically PAYING FULL PRICE FOR PROMOTIONAL COPIES. In the past, the only time I've ever seen a slash through a barcode is when an item isn't supposed to be sold, but given away.The other issue is that the VHS copy is strictly a collector's item (to me, anyway) and it showed up from Amazon each time with the packaging already damaged. They ended up giving me $10 off my next order with them, but I don't see how this is even legal....Did anyone else order this from Amazon and receive the items slashed???"
2,THE MOVIES ARE GETTING WORSE,WHY DO PEOPLE WATCH THESE THINGS? EVENTUALLY SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE HEART FAILUREAND I THOUGHT JASON OR FREDDY WAS BAD THE MOVIES SINCE THE 80'S ARE GOING WAY BEYOND SCARE WHY DO THE WRITERS HAVE TO SCARE THE LIFE!!! OUT OF PEOPLE
1,WOW!! BOTH BORING AND STUPID!!!,"Ok, I rented this this after reading the reviews about how good it was. That it was a great horror movie. I'm a big fan of a good scare and a good story, this had neither. Basically, you're watching a girl housesit for the 1st hour of the movie, then in the last 15 minutes or so, they try and pour on the ""excitement"" Besides one or two little jumps from loud noises when there was silence, there was nothing about this that made me like it. Nothing explained about the story, nothing mentioned about aftermath, nothing, nothing, nothing. Don't waste your money."
5,the devil is in the detail,"""The House of the Devil"" is one of the most suspenseful movies I have seen in ages. It's somewhat slow moving but it really picks up momentum. And even though there isn't much gore or classic horror violence (besides a couple of scenes) that doesn't matter because the main character, Samantha, was very likeable and interesting to follow. For old-school horror with a new twist pick up this movie."
4,Great Homage. Creepy as All Get Out.,"It took three viewings to get through this film, due to its masterful building of suspense. HOTD looks and sounds as though it was filmed thirty years ago, a stroke of genius, in my opinion. Incredibly creepy and unnerving. One of my top ten all time faves."
3,Eerie Tribute to the 80's.,"Don't Expect To be scared right away,the movie takes it time.I thought it was not as scary As it was going to be, but is decent and a different type of Horror Movie than your Typical nowadays."
1,Be afraid.. be very afraid..Of watching this movie,All of the negative reviews are correct. Nothing eerie or suspenseful. Even the climax of the film is like a 20 second scene.
3,The House of the Medevil,"As an avid collector of horror VHS/DVD boxes, The House of the Devil looks pretty darn good. It comes with a decent picture of a House, a Devil and a what looks to be an eyeball on fire."
1,Snoozeville,"This is absolutely the worst ""horror"" movie of all time. Slow moving as some say? How about DEAD? Complete waste of my time watching this crap. If I could rate less than one star, I would. Do not waste you time or money. Burn the buck in the backyard- it'll be over quicker."
4,Teardrops - Lovestation,"UK Maxi Single Track Listing for -""TEARDROPS"" - LOVESTATION1) Joey Negro Edit2) Jamie White Remix3) Eric Kupper Remix2000"
5,"Excellent read...Better than ""the Last samurai"" story","This story is an excellent one with a great ending. The author in my view is very detailed in interpreting the facts and building a detailed story around those facts. The dialog he added made it much better than simply a historical account of the events. So in this book you get a great historical fiction text of a great true story with the fictional details built in around the actual facts that transpired in feudal Japan. The story itself is great about a group of Samurai who lose everything (their Lord Asano, their jobs, their lands) and seek vengeance against the man who cost them everything through that mans corruption. The 47 Ronin lived honorably, fought honorbaly, and in the end died honorably. Well done Mr. Allyn!!!!"
3,47 Ronin,"The lessons of the story are presented as one might expect of a classic, and the story is fleshed out to a medium length novel. However, the writing quality is not the best, though there is a little characterization. It really doesn't ""come alive"", but it covers the ground. If you just want to know the tale, and can't rent the video/dvd, read the book for this purpose."
3,interesting read,"i am a fan of historical fictions so it was a matter of time before i read this book. The book did not strike a chord with me in the sense that it stressed duty and honor since honestly, while I enjoy samurai lore, I feel these guys are pretty darn stubborn and could avoid a lot of the dilemmas they face were they to be humble and suffer some humiliation.However, thats exactly what samurai do not do, for they are a proud class, and this book really captures their devotion and commitment to their ideals. Good read but I wasn't engrossed in the story."
3,I felt it could have been better,"This is a novelized version of a famous historical even, the revenge of the 47 ronin. It was enjoyable reading but I felt it could have moved at a faster pace. I also felt that it should have been geared more toward a younger audience since this type of story would probably be popular with middle school age boys. It would have been more engaging in the way of foreshadowing if the chapters had been given names instead of just numbers. Since it's a novel based on an actual historical event the author should have made some delineations and given actual facts for each major development in the story. Maps and drawings would have also been helpful."
4,Great book,"This is an awesome book. It arrived in great condition, although the book arrived only a day before the maximum time allowed for transactions. I would reccommend both seller and book."
3,Jessamine - 'Don't Stay Too Long' (Kranky) 3 1/2 stars,"This CD is noted as the band's shortest running disc - clocking in 39 minutes. Tunes here I got something good from were the beautiful ""Pilot-Free Ignition"", ""Corrupted Endeavor"" and ""Hand Hold"". Out of all of the Jessamine titles, this is my least favorite, however it's still good - just not as mind-blowing as, say 'Long Arm Of Coincidence' or 'Living Sound'. Personnel: Rex Ritter - guitar, effects, Andy Brown - keyboards, Dawn Smithson - bass & vocals and Michael Faeth - percussion."
3,Sub-Stereolab,"Decent mystique-laden grooves from female-fronted, indie-rock-funk group can provide ample background slink-age but shies away from bolder musical statements under scrutiny."
4,Knifes,Worked really well for a year. The blades are thin and 12 knifes have pices missing along the edge. Hit a bone too hard and wiggle the knife and it breaks a small piece off. Stays sharp for a long time and after 3 years I am still using each one. The handles are cracking but these are for cutting.
5,Great TV Show,Came in a reasonable time limit. I love to watch M*A*S*H. One of my favorite TV shows! I would recommend this!
4,A New Era,"I think the show really peaked during seasons 3, 4 and 5, with season #4 being the best overall. Just incredible material!!Don't get me wrong, all of MASH is fantastic. Season 6 has some great episodes and I can't wait for 6/8/04, as well as season 7 later on this year!!"
4,Season Six,"This DVD set includes 24 episodes from the 1977-1978 season.On the first episode of this set (""Fade Out, Fade In""), we are introduced to a new castmember: Major Charles Emerson Winchester III -- who replaces ""Ferret Face"" Frank Burns. Winchester is an arrogant type from Boston.This was an okay season, Major Winchester is a good fool to laugh at. And you better get used to him, because he stays until the end of the series"
4,"Come on Fox, get with it!!","I find 'viewer from Reality's' arrogance breathtaking. ""Frank Burns will always be more popular with most fans"" he states ""as a fact."" Oh, really? Based on what criteria?Every online poll I've ever seen shows that seasons 6-11 are by far the most popular shows, and that Charles is way more popular than Frank. And with good reason - David Ogden Stiers' performance as Charles Emerson Winchester is sheer brilliance.But why oh why don't Fox (a) put some extras on these sets? couldn't they find anyone to do a commentary or two, and where are all the documentaries that were made over the years? Or the bloopers? and (b) RELEASE THEM MORE QUICKLY!!!! Two releases a year is ludicrous - as is the UK being so far behind that we have to get our 'fix' shipped over from the States."
4,Season 6 -- A New Era,"I think the show really peaked during seasons 3, 4, and 5, with the best season in my opinion being #4. Just incredible material. Season six is on the back end of the shows' peak; however, it is nonetheless fantastic!! Some great moments for sure. Don't get me wrong, every season is great, and I can't wait for season 7 later this year"
4,for the love of california country rock,"I've been a great admirer of country rock performers of the 70's. Herb Pedersen stands as a major contributor to the genre. He played and sung on many major recordings of that time. On his first album, he delivers a strong set of songs that fit perfectly between the Eagles, Poco and the Nitty Gritty band. Some songs have become bluegrass standards like ""wait a minute"", but if you may ear some banjo and mandoline playing, don't get it wrong, it is really a country rock germ!"
5,Great Bible study!!!!!,Easy for children to understand!!! Will use this in Sunday School class. Also good tool for new christian adults. Great!!!!
2,okay...,"it was okay.... i bought armor of God from this guy and it was great, this one was just okay. some of the comments and things he expected me to tell children was not going to happen."
1,Sinatra Singer Of Songs,"Singing is what Sinatra did best. The highlights of these movies are the songs. There are NO CHAPTER STOPS. You can`t get to the damn songs. Are you people insane ??????????? It`s bad enough that there are NO EXTRAS. Not even a trailer or a cut song, but you have to wade through a whole silly movie just to find the music. I might as well just play the records."
1,"Bronx cheer for ""Brooklyn""","This is a movie whose time has past. Unlike its contemporary ""This Time for Keeps"" (also starring Jimmy Durante) this one is stale. It's a relic from the post-WW II years with a script as pedestrian as they get. If you want to see the best this movie has to offer, see ""That's Entertainment."" The clip there of Durante and Sinatra is all this tired black and white musical has to offer."
4,Light entertainment with many charming moments,"This film is worth watching for Sinatra and Jimmy Durante. Their star power comes through despite a weak plot, and they shine both on their own and together. Their duet on ""The Song's Gotta Come from the Heart"" is the comic high point and endlessly enjoyable.What raises the whole shebang to the next level, though, is the outstanding score by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, the songwriting team whose talent Sinatra had brought to the fore. ""The Brooklyn Bridge"" has a lilting melody and memorable lyrics. The two standards, ""Time After Time"" and ""It's the Same Old Dream,"" receive a smooth and completely sincere delivery in the style Young Blue Eyes had already perfected. His audiences in both, though radically different, prove extremely appreciative, and so will you."
2,"Jack McGowan, not JPMcGowan","Common error, and it is true that J.P. McGowan (1880-1952) was Jack to his friends. As J.P., he had over 500 film credits in a forty-year career, only one as ""Jack"". Primarily, he was not a writer, and this film was not in his vigorous, actionful genre at all. Nor did he ever work for M-G-M. From 1940 he is known only as the forceful secretary of the Screen Directors Guild.On the other hand, the writer usually credited as Jack McGowan did write light material, did work for M-G-M -- and was credited for this froth."
4,A GREAT BARGAIN!,"Reviewer Coleen ""Frankie-machine"" did a good job of rating the films in this collection, except for ""Higher and Higher"" (based on the broadway hit), which in my opinion is this sets' best film.Another reviewer says there are no chapter stops. That is not true. There ARE chapter stops about 10-12 minutes apart. However there are no scene selections, and that sucks! Discs however, are closed captioned.[...]"
1,Great cast but not really worth watching.,"This was a poor movie. It was primarily MGM's attempt to ""package"" a movie. The majority of the songs were dull except for the one that Jimmy Durante and Frank do in the music store (It's gotta come from the heart--or something like that). After awhile it turned out to be a bore. And then they had Peter Lawford sing...gimme a break!"
2,"Disappointing, meandering tale","This is the first Marshall Browne novel I have read, and unfortunately, it was disappointing.The book has an interesting premise and starts promisingly. However, it quickly deteriorates as the protaganist is frozen into inaction, spending most of his time wondering what to do.There is little tension here as the novel slowly makes its way to a predictable conclusion.I hear that Marshall Browne's Inspector Anders novels are much more entertaining so it might be worth trying one of Mr. Browne's other novels first; this one wasn't much chop."
2,Deus ex machina,"I'm sorry that I bought the book. The author pulls way too many rabbits out of the hat for me to enjoy this story. The few good descriptive passages and insights into Japan are quickly skewered by another tacky plot device. I'd expect better stuff from a high school AP English class. Yes, it has a compelling flavor that may make a page turner for some; but I'd suggest time and money could be better spent elsewhere."
2,some 35 year old texts are not worth reprinting,..I thought this title would be worth investigating. Frankly it is not - the treatment is disappointing to say the least - this is over-priced (!!) slim 'coffee table' tome. There is little evidence of new research & data. The 'enhanced illustrations' are mostly Tullis profiles lifted directly from the Jagdwaffe series..large photos reproduced over an entire A-4 side are blurred & indistinct...if you know nothing at all about the subject it might be worth looking at..otherwise avoid.
1,You're kidding right?,"These other reviews have to be jokes or written by the author.This book is PAINFUL to read. I can not believe I managed to finish it at all - I'm just grateful I only paid $.25 for the book at a used book store...and I still feel ripped off. Nothing about this book was interesting or entertaining, nothing. It was a cliche for all right-wing loonies to feel good about resisting the evils of the liberals.I have given this book as a gift - a ""Worst book in the world"" gift.Tl;dr - Worst book of the thousands and thousands I have read from the Golden age to 2011."
2,Nice Try,"Here Robinson attempts to address the notorious problems of establishing coherence of the parousia in the New Testament by simplifying Jesus' coming into a single event. Worth a try, but he needs to read out ALL apocalyptic language as being from sources other than Jesus. The argument ultimately founders on the early date of Thessalonians, which may be as early as 40 AD!"
4,A-track fanatics,"""So wrong they are right"" is a film about A-tracks from the fanatic's point of view, including folk singer Michael Hurley. You get to meet some radical characters that tell you everything and more about their passion throughout the nation. You might end up asking if they have any A-tracks left at your thrift store."
2,So Wrong There's . . . Nothing Here,"""So Wrong They're Right"" should not be compared to ""Cinemania."" The latter film not only follows some interesting characters and explores their subculture, it provides insights into why people--all people--love film. ""SWTR"" introduces us to some characters, but they're not too interesting. It does show us their subculture, but it certainly doesn't explore it. And while the idea that people may reject modernity by championing outdated technology is interesting, it is not explored at all. We are left with a film that is ugly to look at, contains no insights, and is rather boring. If you're a rabid 8-track fan, you may enjoy this ride; otherwise, avoid."
5,extraordinairy piano music,"This album is bright, crisp, clean & original. There is nothing muddy or confusing about it. It stands on its own. It has been around for years and holds its own against all others. Joe Sample will lead on to other musicians as you search for people he has played with that express the same artistic and musical qualities. I highly recommend this album."
3,"Carmel track great, other tracks rather bland","Bought the CD based on hearing the song Carmel while it played during a TV morning show. Carmel is a beautiful piece, masterfully done by Joe Sample and his group. But other tracks on the CD were uninspiring and not up to Carmel standards."
2,A Little Disappointing,"I found this book to be a bit disappointing...so many things to experience in Italy and AAA manages to publish only this skinny little book. The pictures are nice, though.--Vicki Landes, author of ""Europe for the Senses - A Photographic Journal"""
3,Good Book,"This was a very good book. Although it was very violent, it was still good. I would of still like the book if he didn't describe the teenagers hacking themselves to death so much with all the gore."
1,It's in the trash bin,I can only contribute to a lower rating. (It doesn't even deserve the one star that I'm forced to give.) Others have already properly stated my complaints and suggestions for improvement. Useless waste of time.
1,BEWARE,"BEware of this software. It is very unreliable, unstable and easy tasks become frustrating. For example some walls you cant erase, others you can.Installing is very complicated as I tried in 3 different computers (by the way, I am a compueter engineer). After many hours of dealing with creating new directories and trying reseting the machines several times I got the softare to run. Once you are playing with designing plans, the system resets and you loose your work. (This has happened several times). All in all, muy suggestion is DO NOT buy this software. The packaging is the only nice thing about it. By the way, the graphics do not come close to the graphics shown in the box.One last thing, once the system crashes (Which is often), you need to shut down the computer since the end task function does not work.Regards\Ed"
1,Junk!,My wife bought me this software because I like to draw the dream house I would build if I won the lottery. While the software is very easy to use it doesn't save what you've done with any consistency. I just lost the house I've been working on for months because it won't open. Stuff moves everywhere in the house; walls and openings you've put in disappear. I will be buying another product from another company.
2,"""A"" for effort, ""D"" for results","You know, I *really* wanted to like this book, as I'm a long-time gargoyle lover and collector. Unfortunately, the book was a major disappointment. The story is disjointed and confusing in parts (there are more than a few ""Huh?"" moments that are never explained or fleshed out), the dialogue and phrasing is amateurish, and there are DOZENS of misspellings and grammatical errors that should have been caught and corrected by a professional editor and/or publisher. I'm sorry, but I have to say it was quite a struggle to get through this, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I'm just glad I only paid $3.00 for my copy and not the $12.95 retail price."
3,YAMAHA MOTORCYCLE MANUAL,A good resource well illustrated but at times confusing due to the number of models it includes. A slimmer volume exclusively on each model / motor size would be easier to comprehend. That said it does the job.
2,Stone of Destiny - Steven McDonald,"If you don't know this performer you should. His group has a wonderful way of presenting music. ""Stone of Destiny"" is really beautiful. I think it matches his songs on ""Sons of Somerled"" if not better. Give yourself a treat and give a listen to this preformer's music."
2,Substandard effort after his spectacular first outing,"After the truly outstanding ""Sons of Sommerled"", Steve McDonald's first album, I was expecting more electrifying percussion work, clever and innovative rhythms and instrument use, and soul-wrenching, heartfelt lyrics. I was greatly disappointed. Aside from a few moments of genius, this album wanders aimlessly down a road of sentimentalism and unimaginative musical rambling. Here's hoping Steve recaptures the magic of ""Sons of Sommerled"" on his third album, which I still highly anticipate and look forward to."
5,Another beautiful CD!,"This guy is GOOD. After listening to Sons of Somerled, I didn't think that there could be any other CD to compare to it... and here comes another one that is just as good if not even better! I admit that I cried the first time I listened to ""Fallen Flowers,"" the second track on the CD. I also felt sudden inspiration when I listened to ""Boadicea,"" the story of the warrior queen of so long ago told in beautiful music. If you don't have this CD... whether you like Scottish music or not... buy it. It is worth the price and more."
2,It broke,"After my first wear, the top ball split. I don't believe I over tightened it, especially since I was aware of the tenancy for the acrylic balls to split over a metal thread. I still gave it two stars because I have purchased other rings from this company with the same materials and had no problems."
3,too morbid for my taste...,"first things first, it is a very good book with great research but just too morbid for my taste. I prefer sight seeing of star homes, movie studios, the Chinese theater, the wax museum, etc.... where celebrities met their mortality has never interested me..."
5,You have to do it to believe it,"I have family that lives in the L.A. area and when I visit them, they know we will do a ""Death Tour"". They teased me at first and then when we started seeing the sites, they stopped!! Now they look forward to the next tour that we will take. This book is an interesting compilation of not only where events have taken place, but also the history behind them. Although, the title can seem a bit ominous, there are a lot of other sites to see in the book besides ""DEATH"" (stars homes, arrest locations, homes used for TV shows, etc.). So, as for the previous review about this being too morbid, I completely disagree. Besides, death is after all a part of life. Enjoy...I certainly have!"
5,Very helpful for scandal lovers!,I love visiting celebrity graves and infamous locations so this book was perfect for me. I even learned about a few scandals I had never heard about before. Mr. Fleming provides good directions and helpful tips so you won't miss a thing. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Hollywood scandals.
4,A Very Interesting Book,"I was pleasantly surprised about how much I liked this book. Even if you never plan on going on any of these tours, it's fun to read the stories about the stars and their lives and there are pictures of some of the houses. It would have been even better if it had pictures of all the houses mentioned in the book but I suppose that's unrealistic. I found only a few typos and inaccuracies but overall it is well-written and if you like to read about the stars from the Golden Age, you will probably like this book."
1,Thought it would get better,"This was a book that came from my mom's library. I have started reading a lot of her old books. I kept thinking this book would get interesting, but it never really did. For the timeframe that it was written, it would probably have been considered risque. Based on reading this book I would not read another of this author's stories."
4,Wagon Christ '- Receiver,"Even though Wagon Christ's RECEIVER single reprises two tracks from his MUSIPAL album, the video game jazz-and-acid of ""Doin' the Do,"" makes it worthwhile, as does the chopped jazz funk of ""Treats in the Streets."" A good accompaniment."
2,Disappointing Product,"The biggest and most serious drawback I ever faced (because of which I have not been able to use the player even once) was the format incompatibility with mp3.This player does not play mp3 files !!! It only recognizes a proprietary format called ATTRAC3 and these songs can only be downloaded using Sonic Stage, provided along with the product. Note that there is NO WAY you can play a song w/o installing sonic and runnning Sonic Stage first on your PC.Due to numerous issues and its incompatibilty with OS versions etc. most people are not even able to run the software therby renderingt he product useless."
3,It's Not All That Great,"I like the amount of songs that it holds and it's size but that's about it.It's a pain in the butt to transfer music, there's only a little hook for a lanyard, it's hard to figure out and the fact that you have to use Sonic to xfer the music evens sucks worse."
1,Bad support and Software,"What's wrong with this device? Well, Sony has done a great job of isolating people from the openess of music. This MP3 Player is small, and holds a lot. Unfortunatly, it requires you to use Sony's software, SonicStage. Because of this, Sony has made sure that you can't get any online songs from anyone else.""At this time, online music services such as the Roxio Napster, Listen.com Rhapsody, or Apple iTunes Music Store are not directly compatible with the Net MD Walkman recorder or Network Walkman player.""This means your using Sony's CONNECT music store to get music online. Not only is this music store hard to navigate, it doesn't seem to have a lot in it.If that doesn't seem bad enough, you'd better keep your installation disc in a safe place. Sony will charge you $20.00 to get another copy from them.Although the MP3 player might work fine, the software and services required to use with it are terrible."
4,Previous review is mistaken about file transfers...,"It's true that you need to use SonicStage in order to be able to PLAY songs on this player. However, when you attach the NW-E107 to the USB cable, it is recognized as a USB drive. You can, in fact, drag and drop files onto it, as well as off of it."
5,I wouldn't workout without it!!,"This mp3 player is great! It's small, has a long battery life, and it can hold a ton of songs. Also, it has two modes so you can skip easily from playlist to playlist or just look through the songs from one playlist. I recommend getting the armband that goes with it. It makes working out very enjoyable and it doesn't get in the way. Overall, a great product."
1,It is not a MP3 Player,"This device is not a MP3 player because it just plays Sony's audio format (ATRAC), so you always have to convert your MP3 files into ATRAC format using a software provided by the manufacturer (that is not so easy to use)."
1,Not a Javier Solis Movie,"Javier Solis solo aparace en esta pelicula 4 veces y como por 2 segundos cada vez, de las canciones que interpreta solo 2 y con muy mala luz. Si eres un fan de Javier Solis mejor guarda tu dinero, este DVD es una gran decepcion.English--I read the review that is posted in Spanish about this movie and is misleading,I bought this DVD because I'm a big fan of Javier Solis but I was very dissapointed he appears in this movie only 4 times & for about 1 second he only sings 2 songs one of them is not even the complete version & the ligthing of this film when he sings is very bad. The movie and the acting are weak. (Playboy (Guillermo Murray) wants to trick rich woman out of her money.) The very young Guillermo Murray's appearance kind of makes it bearable to watch. You are better off saving your money."
4,Rough And Smooth,"This album is for the experienced listener. What does that mean? One who will focus solely on the music; giving the album several listens; concentrating on the eclectic blend of music styles. This is for music aficionados, like myself, who appreciate break beats, keyboard experimentation, offbrand lyrical music. This has it all and still grinds out a funky bassline groove. Wait till you hear they're next recording ""Almost In"". Whew! What can I say. Keep swingin!"
4,tunak me to sleep!!!,"would've given it an extra star,but the rest of the album just isn't as good as tunak tunak tun the song!awesome dance music!"
3,Only for the serious collector,"Well if it is your aim to have every song by The Who, then you have to buy this one despite it's price tag. Too bad it did not have ""Relay"" on it."
4,EARLY NO LIMIT,"THIS IS A VERY RARE TAPEIT COST ME A LOT OF $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ TO GETIF YOU LIKE MASTER P GETDA LAST DON - GOOD SIDE BAD SIDE - GAMEFACE - GHETTO D - GET AWAY CLEAN - GHETTO POSTAGE,FREE MAC - LOCKED UP SINCE MARCH 28 2000"
3,Interesting exploration but...,"I'm never sure how to respond to experimental found text books. They are interesting as an exercise - especially to observe one's response to texts out of their context. However, rarely do they work as literature in their own right - at least in the sense of being of interest in 500 years. When they work, I still consider them emphemeral.99: The New Meaning is not an exception. The provision of the number of words in each extract appears to add no value other than insuring the reader correctly identify when the extracted text begins. In this particular case, I found myself uncomfortable with the European-centric text; in some manner, it caused me to read the text as an ""inside literati"" text.In short, the text is worth reading as experimental text but not particularly a original experiment."
4,"Very fresh, upbeat, great voice. Fun summer tunes!","This disc has been fun to listen to. Sounds a bit like 'Till Tuesday, but fresh and a slight - slight- twang that adds Australian character. Her voice is honest, soothing, heartfelt. This disc will be fun to listen to."
5,I haven't been this inspired by an artist since Indigo Girl,"I fell in love with Eva Trouts voice the first time I heard the song ""Beautiful South"" on t.v. I haven't been this excited about an artist since I discovered the Indigo Girls over five years ago!! Her music is a perfect combination of emotion, music and voice."
3,Harmless.,"This is a pleasant listen that won't offend. There is indeed some very nice music on here--in my opinion a rarity that lyrics don't detract from music that could stand alone. They play a mean accordion (in a quite agreeable way), too. Get this band some gee darn publicity!"
2,Where's The Soul?,"Apparently, some of the reviewers of this single have amnesia. Because I know they are old enough to remember that you could not have walked into a club in 1988 without being blown away by the fab remixes of ""So Emotional"" and ""Love Will Save The Day"". Whitney was hip to the importance of a jamming club remix long before girls with names like Mariah, Amber, Toni, Deborah, Celine, Taylor, Ultra and Kristine had record deals.That said, it is a shame to see that Hex Hector has run out of ideas. Whitney has rendered a powerful, dramatic vocal, but Hex has turned it into some tired circuit party crap. Jr. Vasquez hasn't done a decent remix in years.Whitney needs a pumping, original, festive club mix to complement this fantastic vocal, where are Masters At Work when you need them?"
2,mix of colors,"I ordered 7 boxes to do kitchen floor. It was to be a temp job since I plan to re-do the entire kitchen next spring , but wanted something to cover the floor until then. After laying about 4 rows , I started see a color difference in 2 of the rows. I took it to be just a shadow from an adjacent window and finished laying the remaining tiles. Once the whole job was complete, I had 3 different people come in and look at the floor, and they could see a color difference in several rows . Some of the tiles are a whiter background then others. It might not sound so bad , but visually it is noticeable, Needless to say I am glad this is just a temporary project.The price I paid for these tiles were reasonable to me since I knew I would be pulling them up in about a year or less so it works from that prospect, I can only guess that the tiles were made on different lots or different dyes from the factory , whatever the case ,,they are a mix of colors."
2,"Save your $$, don't buy.","I had high hopes for this CD, I was / am a S&C fan. The quality of the recording and the arrangements of the songs suggest that this must be what it's like to hear S&C in a club that has poor acoustics. The first five songs are classics, the balance are new songs that are forgetful. I'll make you a deal, give me $10.00 and my copy is yours. Save your hard earned money and buy their greatest hits CD. You will be able to remember this first class duet as they should be remembered."
5,Traces of the Traceless Friends,These recordings in 2005 are equal to or greater than the original versions and represent some of the most beautiful and rich songwriting and vocal and musical performances I have ever heard. This music has a pure and loving quality which emerges from the beauty and creativity of Seals and Crofts as both musicians and through the spiritual enrichment of their Baha'i faith. Many of these songs are already enduring classics in popular and rock music. Listening to this album is a celebration of the beauty of life and love.
4,None better for the price,"This is my second Belkin. I even had a small AC plugged in.The only thing I experienced is that the cable or phone gets fuzzy if you pass it through this surge protector. But for electricity, it works great. Great price also.I haven't used the wall mount because I don't want to drill holes. Sometimes you have to yank a plug out, and I just don't want to cause any damage."
1,Not a wall-mount surge protector,"I bought this because the title of the product on Amazon indicated it has a ""wall-mount"" option. But it does not. This does not mount on the wall and has no hardware to do this. It is an ordinary surge protector."
5,I like it,"It's just a surge protector, but this is nicer looking than other ones I've had over the years, and the cord is long enough to actually move it to where it needs to go. I recommend buying it."
4,Cezanne's landscapes,"Excellent presentation and exploration of the interpretation of Cezanne's landscapes, sites. The author did a fantastic job locating the spots from where Cezanne observed and conveyed his images. The author's own thoughts and insights were instructive as well.The book was used in good condition, only the cover was poor."
1,I would like to receive the book first.,I don't know where the book is. I haven't heard or seen anything that suggest I will receive it anytime soon. ARE YOUR SERIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Al-Anon,I was not impressed. It didnt help me in my instance. But that is not say it would not help someone else. I think this subject is very personal and each person will have to find their own way when it comes to help books.
5,how alanon works,prompt delivery and excellent condition. this book is a great start to help people understand the effects of problem drinking and how it affects the family.
2,Hoping for better condition,I received this book with a non-removeable sticker on the front (very large covering most of the cover) and there were notes from the previous owner all throughout the book. Since it's a self-help book the writing in all the margins and the underlining on most pages made my feel like I was reading someone else diary! Disappointing...
2,Noth What They Claimed,"I ordered the book, knowing it was used, for a family friend. But I chose it because the description said it was ""like new."" When my son-in-law received it, he said it had been obviously well-used, with comments written on the sides of pages and sections highlighted in yellow marker. That's not even close to what I would call ""like new."" He was gracious about it, and was glad to have a copy, but, besides being embarassed, I was not happy. I wasn't trying to pass on this book as a brand new one; my son-in-law just expressed interest in having a copy of it. But when a seller claims his product is ""like new,"" I would expect a book in much better condition than the one I got!"
4,A good Debut!,"A Black Moon is a good start off point for Bal-Sagoth. While the album sounds very different from their later efforts, it is easy to recognize many of the elements the band would use later on. ...But what I like most about this album is the early 90s Death Metal feel the album has. There are passages where Byron sings with a low grunt, but there are other passages where he does his, although not as common, trademark narrations. The production values, while having more in common with a death metal sound, are stellar. I would recomend this album to anyone who wants to listen to some early symphonic death or any Bal-Sagoth fan.-Jason"
5,I love this book,"As another reviewer pointed out; this is Boortz at his best. Satire, wit and coherent observations with a ""take no prisoners"" style hallmarks this book. I've read it 3 times.I miss Neal though. I can't stand listening to his radio show anymore. It nothing but a long litany or pro-Bush propaganda.I am wondering what happened to the old Neal ""you know a politican isl ying when you see his lips move"" Boortz.Today it is like the Bush administration slipped something into the AC vent at his Atlanta studio.Neal - W is just another lying politician like all of them. whats the deal? Do we need to get you de-programmed like a Moonie?Neal - read your own book - this one. Maybe you'll pop out of your trance.Neal - we want you back. We have enough Hannity's and Limbaughs. We need a BOORTZ!"
4,Great Book,"I enjoy Neal Boortz. His books tell the truth. Sometimes, we don't like the truth....but he tells it anyway. And he is usually right. Well written and entertaining. I recommend this book to everyone"
1,Get it right!! Liberals are not social controllers!,"I am fed up with this misappropriation of a perfectly good word, 'liberalism'.From the Cambridge Dictionary:liberal (POLITICS) adjective (of a political party or a country) believing in or allowing more personal freedom and a development towards a fairer sharing of wealth and power within society.liberal (SOCIETY) adjective respecting and allowing many different types of beliefs or behaviour a liberal society/church/ideological position/person.Okay, how does that equate to the type of thing Boortz rants endlessly on about? Answer: it doesn't.Liberals believe in freedom and choice tempered by social responsibility. What Boortz thinks he's talking about is communism, of a type which barely exists in the world any more. And the idea that - in the US context - the Democratic party aspires to control every aspect of individual lives is ludicrous.But then, what's more ludicrous still is that, instead of laughing at this book, people take it seriously!"
5,The Terrible Truth About Liberals,"My son starts college this summer at a state university, so I wanted to read the book and see if this would arm him to overcome some of the rhetoric he was going to be bombarded with over the next four years. Yep, this is the book for that. Loved it. I found the last chapter to be right-on, and was much suprised to see Neal talk about it. Buy it!"
4,I liked it but Boortz is a bit of a pig,"If you can stand the Howard Stern of conservative talk radio then you'll like this book. If you like Rush BigMouth then you'll love Neal Boortz, because Boortz actually knows something and has an IQ higher then 95."
2,"OK, But Superficial","I sometimes enjoy listening to Boortz's show, and he makes some good points in this book, but overall, the book is pretty superficial. Listen to one of his radio monologues instead."
1,more mean spirited whining from the GOP's leading bigot,"Boortz continues to vicously attack those who disagree with him, while ignoring the same flaws in those he likes.His character is defined by remarks such as laughing about ""homeless-sickles"" the day after a homeless person was found frozen to death in Atlanta. A truly mean spirited soul."
3,Typical White Hatred,"Neal's philosophy: If you are Rich and White you have worked for and deserved everything that you own, If you are poor and black you are morally weak and your poverty is divine justice. Elitist garbage from the talk-astard himself. This philosophy created the great divide in this county, and people like Boortz want to keep it that way."
1,Another book by and for functional illiterates,"This book is a tiresome compendium of Boortz's radio rantings. Most of Boortz's argumentation is so vague and so undocumented it is beyond all belief. Here's a check for all such rhetoric: Replace the word ""Liberal"" with, ..........; and see how the book reads. Boortz has convinced himself there is no freedom in America anymore. Hopefully he will take the nosefull of nickels he made with this book and swim away to establish his own dictatorship."
2,neal boortz has gained the fat rush has lost,"boortz book is the same fascist bologna he has spouted for years, too many years. To even suggest a 165 page snail-effort is a book is insulting to even his loyal listeners. If Mr. Boortz intends to write another ""book"" in the future I wish he could try to keep the same thought process for a book worth writing, not a single minded essay."
2,"Incredible con's from America's top rated ""con""serv","For someone who claims to be sooo intelligent, Neal does nothing in this book but throw out the same mindless garbage about liberals that has been the source for so much of his own personal wealth and gain. (Without it he would still be working his original job as a delivery man - a worthless job I suppose to his greatness) I believe that he would have contributed more to his fellow Americans doing precisely this, and that his views on the wealthy would be vastly different if he was back in his ""old"" shoes. Amazing how the love of money can completely distort ones entire perspective on life. It is amusing to read however for the less gullible reader."
1,Why pay for it?,"Why pay for something you've already heard for free. This non-rational aspect of markets is but one of many realities that this libelous, .. ignores."
3,A European's View,"I have NOT read this book yet, and I don't think I will. However, I incidentally listened to the live-stream of Boortz' radio show on WSB. For me, as a European, it is incredible that such plain and simple people find opportunities this vast to make themselves heard AND even read among middle-class citizens.I base my critique primarily on one statement Boortz uttered in that show... He stated that American Culture were ""inherently superior"" to any other on the globe. Excuse me, but just the fact that the American ""culture"" is very convenient and globally successful just implies that it is the world's fittest, but not necessarily its finest! What Boortz does is like stating that rats were absolutely sublime and superior beings just because they can hardly be extincted!Don't get me wrong, I revere and study the American Culture profesionally and would never assimilate it to a rats' plague! OK?D. Marin, Germany"
1,Amazon.com Scoops Boortz!,"Finally, a place where people can talk about Neal without being cut off and swept under the carpet. Boortz never has the gonads to let people talk on his program that have an iota of knowledge b/c that would make him look dumb. He's even got his token black guy and white woman to back him up in the radio studio.This book is just like Neal's show: it is entertainment - that is all. He machine guns anything in his path and pulls mundane shock-jock tactics in order to appeal to the vapid masses out there who are too desperate to have someone's approval that appears to be in a position of authority.Neal Boortz is a carny balker - he is the man behind the curtain. Period."
4,Boortz knows what he's talking about.,"I first read this book about a month ago, and I plan on purchasing myself a copy sometime within the next week.It is a great book for any one of you to buy as a gift for any of your liberal friends. He lays out ""the terrible truth about liberals"" in terms even a liberal could understand. Choose a topic, Boortz covers it. Boortz does in this book just what he does on his radio show: he tells everyone what others are afraid to tell--the truth about liberals."
5,Take some responsibility,"This is a short book. That is because it is simple stuff. Neal reduces it all down to a delicious sauce that could really enhance the flavor of this country, if people would only wake up.Take the first step. Buy this book, then take responsibility for yourself, AND your rights! These are the ideas that made this country great right from the begining, and enabled us to correct our mistakes.A little common sense in a little book.Thanks, Neal!"
4,Tells it like it is,"Great analysis of how liberals think. It's good to understand the differences in how people of this kind think. Liberalism was once a good thing for everyone, but the word has been changed and used by those who no longer want what's best for everyone in the US to prosper.Liberalism now means cruelty."
3,Sounds like a combination of Poco and Loggins and Messina,"This is a rather short CD, but isn't bad overall. The music sounds like a combination of Poco and Loggins and Messina. The first 2 songs sound especially like L & M. Of course, they would naturally sound somewhat like Poco because this is where Richie Furay came from. If you like pop/rock/country from the 70's you will enjoy this one!"
2,Mid-seventies identity-kit LA rock,"'Trouble in Paradise' was David Geffen's second and final attempt at creating a CSNY super-group by merging three disparate (or maybe desperate) talents. 1974's 'Souther Hillman Furay' album was a good-sounding debut, whch hinted at better things to come from the trio once they had gotten a chance to merge into a productive unit. Unfortunately, the follow-up was even more fragmented. It sounds like 3 mini-albums: Richie Furay's Poco outakes, Chris Hillman's Manassass outakes and J.D Souther's Eagles/Jackson Browne tribute act. Allegedly, Furay was heard to remark forlornly during recording sessions 'and to think I left Poco for this?'. I rest my case."
4,Parliamentary Procedure at a Glance,"The copy of the book ""Parliamentary Procedure at a Glance"" I received via Amazon is of very good quality, considering it was printed 20 - 30 years ago.It has long been ""out of print""'I am happy with this item.Sincerely yours, Duane J. Matthiesen, Lexington, Massachusetts"
5,Excellent.,"Beautiful vocals,and wonderful lyrics. A song that is soft but has an infectious chorus. This is one single that is destined to parallel it's UK position here at number one. I have watched all their released singles reach number one in the UK and own their debut album which contains 17 songs, including Swear it Again. Do not deprive yourself of this album, pop fans, because this one's a diamond! It has found its way into my heart and the hearts of all Westlife's fans world-wide, grab a copy before you miss out! one hot single- you WON'T be disappointed!"
4,(4-1/2 stars) Refreshing,"Has anyone heard from these guys? This single went gold back in 2000, but their album didn't even crack the top 100. This was one boy band that stood out from the rest: good vocals, good lyrics, and good harmonies. They didn't even end up on TRL."
1,Why Compare?,"I now own six Acker albums and I see the critics compare him to Fountain and Shaw, etc. Don't bother. Listen with your heart and soul and you will just love what Acker has produced. The clarinet just talks to you with all the feelings that he gives you. Even when he lends vocals to the various tracks I find it unique and enjoyable. That's the key....Just ENJOY!"
1,tired of conspiracy books,read Dr Michael Baden's book. It explains that JFK was shot from BEHIND twice. Also read Bugliosi's Rcclaiming History. Between Baden and Bugliosi JFK's assassination is explained in logical detail. There was no conspiracy. Oswald acted alone. Get over it people.
1,Another theory I have dismissed,The frontal wound was one of an EXIT not entry. No support for Dr Crenshaw from me.
5,JFK Cover UP,"The MD in charge of the trauma center that worked on JFK and Oswald writes of his experiences. A recommendation is the fact that the JAMA had a press conference to publicize an article condemning the book and its' author. He prevailed in a lawsuit against them. Recommended reading for all who have an interest in conspiracies. Should be on the shelf with ""Bloody Treason""."
3,Another case for conspiracy,"Dr. Crenshaw demonstrates the fatal head shot came from the front. If you don't mind a lot of technical writing, this makes for a good read."
1,Conspiracists do not remotely understand physics,"This book is the usual collection of fiction about the Kennedy assassination. Gary Waltrip doesn't have to rewrite the laws of physics to explain why Kennedy's head snapped backwards when shot from behind -- two different researchers proved that is exactly what happens because of the jet effect of materials blown out the front. One researcher shot watermelons off of fence posts, and everyone of them fell off TOWARDS the rifle, not away from them. Another researcher did the same thing with 5 gallon cans filled with water. Furthermore, the computer enhancement of the Zapruder filsm shows Kennedy's head moving forward very rapidly BEFORE it snaps backwards with the jet effect. This is a great example of how the conspiracy buffs don't even know the most basic facts about the assassination."
5,DJ Irene Pushing the envelope,"If you are a person who just casually listens to techno, or dance music in general, this cd may not be for you because of the 'non mainstreamist' reasons, though if you are an old skooler to the rave/house/progressive scene and/or an inspiring dj, or anyone who would like to hear what it really sounds like to push the envelope of djing to the edge, this cd is definitely for you. DJ Irene does it again, this time spinning the seemingly impossible, mixing rock/metal with techno. At first I didnt know what to expect but I made myself buy it because I am a big Dj Irene fan, and this is the best $17.00 investment I have ever made, if you like house/turntablism, even if you don't feel like ordering it off of the internet, you better step your [...] to the nearest music store and plant the cash because it's definitely worth your time!"
4,another stylistic leap forward,"This album further progresses Irenes status as the most daring and forward looking dj in dance music today. Blending rock, house, trance, d n' b (or jungle whatever) together with ease and precision may sound impossible but she does it deftly. Not only does the cd span so many styles but she now has the clout to include producers tiesto and deep dishes tracks the latter of which completely rocks my world. If you catch a chance to see her live don't miss it because this woman knows how to work a crowd like few djs do. She is a true rock star."
4,This is what house is supposed to sound like,"Spank me sideways!! I am letting this cd live in my stereo. It has got everything a little trance, some dirty house and the drum and bass anthem (anthem 2004) rocked. this is what house is supposed to be, and even if you are an uncoordinated white guy like me you will find yourself moving, I swear it."
1,Steady Decline,"Over the years DJ Irene has been known as one of the largest DJ's in the world. I guess with increasing popularity only comes the inevitable decline that is mainstream. With a title like ""Rock Star"" it's no wonder why Irene seems to have an ascent into the bad DJ hall of fame. I have seen Irene live several times and it shows in her performances as well. With each new release I see this once acclaimed producer falling into a deeper and deeper hole. You want good Irene CD's refer back to the Club series mixes and the Hard House Diva ones as well. Don't agree with me, spend two months in the scene and you will see why Irene is simply the record labels new project."
4,Ephedra Conspiracy,"I have been taking Ephedra for three years now and have followed the label requirements with no ill effects. I really believe this is just a way for government and pharmacuetical companies to try to restrict the rights on those who take supplements. In the book the author points out what really happens behind the scene in Washington with using the media and press to drive the fear into people who want to take Ephedra. ANYONE who takes supplements, not just Ephedra should give this book a look since it shows that it could happen with any supplement."
3,Good food but doesn't float,"My five turtles love this food, but unfortunately it sinks very quickly and makes the tank really dirty. I don't use this food anymore because it wasn't worth the hassle of having to clean the tank more often. Again, good food, but it sinks too quickly and makes a huge mess."
4,Second Book of a Three-Book Series,"Fear Park continues on. I love amusement parks and I love R.L. Stine. But this book isn't cozy - it is more gory. Even though it was a fun and enjoyable book, I left one star for the goriness."
1,Awful,"This is a very terrible book.It isn't just that everyone dies horribly and their eyeballs roll around the ground,there is no peaceful conclusion.In order to (hopefully) get that, you are told to buy the next book.What if you got it at the library?All I got from this was a load of violence and gore with,like I said,nothing pleasant to take from it.So I'll sum up the book for you.People die.Their eyeballs fall out.Their limbs fall off.They get eaten.EVERYBODY dies.The End."
5,A History of Graphic Design by Philip Meggs,"I am a student of Graphic Design, and was assigned this book as a supplementary text for my class of the History of Graphic Design. I am impressed with his well-written and considerable text as well as accompanying pictures. This is is a well-researched and thorough compilation of information which starts at 6000BC. I would consider this to be the bible to any graphic design student."
5,A textbook worth keeping,"My History of Graphic Design class used this book extensively and it's a book I enjoyed learning from. I usally have to sell my books back at the end of the quarter, but this one was gorgeous enough to be spared from the chopping block. Every now and then I pull it off the shelf to browse through and learn something."
3,Terrible Resolution,"I purchased this for the kindle app on the iPad and was extremely disappointed in the sample images that are included throughout the ebook. They're low resolution, the image where timeline is showed, the text is barely readable."
4,Excellent cradle which concisely contextualizes one's work.,The third edition is even better than the second. An instructor's handbook with suggested multiple choice on-line quizes might expedite the function of the information flow to students and enhance its pedagogical purposes.
3,Who chose the typeface for this book?,"As much as I admire Phillip Meggs for the historical content and the wealth of images in this book, I have one criticism-the text is not readable. Speaking as a designer and as a college instructor, this book would be more readable had the publisher used a serif typeface. What good is clean design and excellent content if the text puts the reader to sleep?"
5,Must-have TV reading,"Sparkling with slick prose, and some downright funny quotes from a variety of TV shows, TV Therapy picks out perceptive aspects from your favorite TV shows that will have you watching them again with fresh eyes. With the food and drink recipies, you'll have culinary company that adds more dimension to the experience, whether it's burritos for dinner, or cocktails and party platters with friends."
1,not the best form of B-12,"I bought these when I ran out of my other brand of B-12. This B-12 is in the form on cyno cobalamin, which is not easily utilized by the body. The better form is methyl cobalamin. They are sub lingual, which is good and the taste is ok. If they work for you great, but I'll stick with the other form."
5,b12,A friend recommended this item to stop canker sores and boy did they do the trick. Not to mention the added extra energy the offer. WOW!
1,twin labs b-12 5000 mcg vitamins,This item was sent me as a re-oder and I did not order them. Would not have re-ordered them. I had not choice but to keep them. Did not know how to send them back. Other b-12 vitimans are better
5,Fast and reliable.,I was amazed how fast the product arrived. I saved a bundle buying from this dealer.
3,OK stand but not the best.,"Pro- Supper fast delivery, nothing broken or damaged.- Good packaging with full details for assembling parts.- Sleek overall design.- Does not look cheap.Con- This stand is best for 36-42 inches or 46"" with small outerframe (Samsung 46"" should be ok). Sony xbr 46 on this stand is out of proportion (It is like an elephant sits on top of a mouse's feet). The width of TV is longer than width of the stand. Definitely 50 inches tv is not good on this stand.- It looks sturdy but not physically strong. If I push against the main pole slightly it shakes.I give it 4 stars for overall but reduce 1 star due to the description says up to 50"" which is not true. It can hold up to 50"" tv but it looks out of proportion."
3,Great TV stand if you don't have a lot of peripherals,This is a good looking stand with solid construction. The main problem is the narrow central canal to rout all the wires. If you have to connect more than two peripherals then this would be a very difficult stand.
3,"Nice product, questionable service","Here it is a MONTH later, and still no response from the Distributor of the product. Overall a pretty good TV stand, but one shelf mounting bracket came in drilled wrong. Sent a request for a replacement, but not a word from them yet."
5,Couldn't be happier,"I bought this item almost a year ago now, so I don't remember the purchase price off hand, I believe it was in the area of $330. I absolutely love this tv stand, I have a 42"" samsung on there and it is very sturdy. I must say I was very concerned with the glass shelfs and the weight it can hold, the connection is consisted of 2 screws on the shelf and 2 additional ones on the body of the stand itself. I would highly recommend not overloading the weight on either one of the shelfs, but I can tell you I have a satellite receiver and a dvd player on 1 shelf and a laptop (~8lb) on the other shelf, and they hold just fine. I prefer a more modern look, so I opted to purchase a tv stand instead of a entertainment center, also I avoided drilling holes in the walls and have the option to move the tv if I choose to. Overall, highly recommended."
3,"Good, but could be better","3 stars because of these issues:- bad paint job on base shelf, had to use black marker to disguise unpainted white spots- the ""Cable Management"" could be much easier if back of the pole had removable part(s).Also, I should comment on tilting. I think this feature is useless unless you mount TV high on the wall. It would have much more sense if mount had swivel ability.Overall I'm satisfied with this stand and would recommend it."
3,Needs to be updated for modern systems,"I was skeptical that the glass might break in transport but it arrived in excellent packaging. The quality was excellent, it was extremely easy to assemble. Also, the price is less than half of similar products.It would have been good if it was available with slightly bigger shelves. The shelves need to be atleast 34 inches wide to be able to carry 2 stacks of equipment. If you have a Cable Box, Tivo, DVD Player, VCR, Amplifier and PS2, there is no way you can arrange them side by side on the 2 shelves without putting some on the floor. Each shelf can accommodate only 1 of these boxes at a time as each box is about 17 inches wide. It would have been much better if the middle shelf was 34 inches wide instead of 30."
2,Review of Sport of the Gods,"In this book, I believe Paul Laurence Dunbar used fictional characters to protray his thoughts about how the black race was thought of in the mid-1990s. He was accalimed for his way of bringing concern to the topic of racial discrimination through writing. The novel kept me interested, but wasn't something to make a movie out of."
4,A grown-up Nelson in his Prime!,"Former teen idol Rick Nelson was making some of the best music of his career in the early 70's, hard-driving country-rock that stands comfortably next to Michael Nesmith's in sound & quality. Only nobody was buying! Too bad... Excellent covers of Dylan's ""Just Like A Woman"" and the Stones' ""Honky Tonk Woman"" round out a great collection of Nelson originals. ""This Train"" is one of my favorite ""new"" rock tunes, and perhaps the only song I've ever felt was just TOO SHORT! The album's finale is the incredible, powerful and eerily prophetic ""Gypsy Pilot"", on which Rick sings about life on the road. It ends with the sound of a plane crash. Isn't that just spooky?This album is now also available as a ""twofer"" with the earlier ""RICK SINGS NELSON"", which is almost as good, and for real fans may be a better deal."
4,Nice but bulky & tight ports,"Belkin Components F9M923-08 9-Outlet Maximum SurgeMasterI bought this last year and it does a good job.9 outlets are a plus but the outlets are bit tight to use, I dont know why big players like Belkin do a poor job in standard sizes. ( so 4 *)Poor manual does not show which are direct lines ( gets power even if u turn off the switch)N/w port is a missing part but telephone lines are + ( i don't used telephone lines )"
5,Works for me,"Not much to say for this other than I plugged in my TV, Laptop, shreader, cable modem, router, etc. and it works like a champ. Having a 2 year old that likes to mess around with stuff, it is nice to have the child covers on some of the outlets too. Finally, more than enough room for all the bigger adapters."
4,Good,"this is a good surge protector at a good price,but the problem I have with the selle is, I emailed them & they said it was coming by reg mail,USPS, but it come by DHL, they could have sent me a tracking no, like I asked but they did not, so this seller custermer service is not very good at all!"
4,"Everything is okay, except the color.","I ordered this item online where it shows the color is black. However, the one I received is white. I'm a little unhappy since it does not match my other stuff. Other than that, everything is okay."
1,Wrong color,"Beware, the item is not as pictured. I'm sure it works great but I specifically ordered a dark strip so as not to be as stark as an ordinary white one. Surprise, it's white."
3,a little disappointed,"After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase 2 of these. When they arrived, 1 was defective - the ground light did not work and I had to return it. Generally I do not think they are as well made as some other reviews state. A couple of the 'inputs' feel like there is not a good contact when the plug is inserted. However, I am replacing the defective one and keeping the other because I like the protection warranties and I hope once in place in my home, they will do the job."
4,Good enough,"It's a large, multi-outlet surge protector. I would have preferred a black color, but it only seems to come in white. Be aware that the protector is rather tall when placed on the floor - it may not fit under some furniture when you plug things into it."
4,No problems but request a manufacturing tweak.,"I haven't had any problems with the surge protector. But, if Belkin were to do some product tweaks, I would ask for better hanging holes (on the back) and a new on/off switch. Several times I have accidentally flipped the on/off switch. Unfortunately, my DVR needs constant power for the guide to stay active - it was messed up for almost 12 hours."
1,Warranty is unreliable and poor customer service,My Belkin went bad and the plastic began burning. I smelt the burning plastic before it burned down my house. I filed a claim and sent the Belkin surge protector back and never heard anything from them --not even a little postcard that my claim had been denied.
2,Don't leave a tip,"Cover art--------that is about it, beyond that I really did not care for this and hoped from the quirky cover and pre-info, we'd have another SOTD film. Sadly not the case ---- they always say if you cannot say anything good then don't talk up -- okay then just this, save your money and for the Queen's sake - rent first."
1,terrible mistake,"There is a terrible mistake with this 2012 ""original"" edition. The second track appears in the cover and in the disc as ""Dear Lord"" but is ""welcome"", the same track that appears in Kulu se Mama, keeping the same tracks (but Virgil) than in the previous 1993 edition. I can imagine how somebody can make that mistake.Moreover this edition is not in digipack like all the previous discs from this ""original edition"" (from Africa Brass to Mama). The art is absolutly poor, with no notes, with no pictures. Probably the worst reedition in the whole Coltrane catalogue."
4,"A good recording from the quartet, but not the best","All of the material recorded by Coltranes legendary quartet is quite good. In this recording, our protagonist is moving towards abandoning tonality (hence the name ""Transition""). The sound on this recording is somewhat avant-garde, but it is still quite listenable. However, those who don't already own several of Tranes recordings may want to pass this up and get one of the other ones.The music is worth having, but I recommend getting it as part of the 8 CD Impulse! box set, not on this CD."
5,The name says it all,"This record is a joy, you hear the end of one sound and the conception of another, the pages of the book of life turning. A great record in and of itself, very spiritual, even the titles point the way to what was coming next."
5,Awesome Book,"This is an excellent book to get to know the basics of PTSD as well as treatments and steps for therapy. It is user friendly, with a simple language that makes it easier to read for any one. Bought about 5 PTSD books for my college project and this one is the best of them. I Recommend it."
5,must-read and very practical,This is a must-read book about Post Traumatic Stress.Highly recommended and very comprehensive. It is a book tocontinually refer back to. Very helpful!!!
4,PTSD,This is a must have for those who work with clients with PTSD. It is easy to understand and is helpful for clients to read and process with the counselor.
1,TOO BASIC !,"If you've spent any time in therapy or know about this condition,you will find this book to contain little information that you didnot know.I am returning my useless copy ."
5,Help yourself find who you are after trauma,Reading through this book with a therapist slowly over time will help a traumatized person realize that the pain and trauma they have been through IS treatable. It will assist that person in finding out who they are and help them move forward into a successful happy life.
4,Great,I found this book to be easy to read and written in plain english. It will be a great source of information for my clients. It is not always easy to find a text that is user friendly for most levels. The author does a wonderful job incorporating all of the information in a way that is not intimidating to the average person.
5,it's black pvc pipe in my lungs...,"it makes you think of things that most people hide from...but the funny thing is, is that you'll come back for more. Great."
5,Amazing Family Film,"Desi Brooker is a 12 year old girl who believes in angels, heaven and the power of dreams. But when her father's business falls prey to scheming Dirk Jenkins, Desi calls for some heavenly help. Together, Desi and her guardian angel attempt to bungle Dirk's devilish plans and save the day. In the meantime, she and her father both learn that if they have faith in themselves, they can over-come anything."
5,"More sweet jazz from Lateef, the Master","I continue to be amazed at how unknown and underrated Lateef is. I've only recently discovered him, and I have loved just about every second of music I've heard on his albums.Nobody, and I mean nobody, plays with more soul and delicacy than Lateef. He may not be as far out as Coltrane or Dolphy or Coleman, but he plays with all the passion that they do. And with a beauty of phrasing and a note selection that is like honey to my ears.If you want jazz music that is soulful, sweet, melodic and gorgeous, you can do no better than an album like this one from Yusef Lateef."
2,No thanks,"I was quite disappointed in this book as I really enjoyed the last Alexandra Potter book I read.Whilst I am sure Deliliah (the main character) was intended to come across as young and naive, her sheer stupidity really irked me. I was really glad to finish this book!"
3,Not great,This book teaches a technique of beading but there isn't much of a connection to earrings which is what it is supposed to be about. The diagrams are clear and in black and white. There are a few color pictures of beading. The authors didn't put much effort into making the pages pleasing to the eye.
3,Caution! Looking for Phil Keaggy's CD?,"If you were brought here while looking for Phil Keaggy's album 'Zion,' be very sure that you buy a copy that specifically says either 'Phil Keaggy' or 'Canis Major' in the 'Seller Information' description. Otherwise, you will quite possibly be ordering a completely different recording from a German group named Söhne Mannheims.Please note that my rating is based on the riskiness of ordering the correct product here, and not on the (very high) quality of Phil Keaggy's music."
5,not a disappoinment,"Although this album lacks the powerful captivating essence Shadow Weaver presented, I would firmly state this album to be a one of a kind musical treasue. (what else could one expect from the dots? only greatness my friend, only greatness)"
5,Pink Barett,It's a unique great psychedellic band. It is like Syd Barett would sound with Pink Floyd at the end of the XX. century.
5,Amazon have put the wrong tracklist for this particular CD!,"This MFSL release does NOT have any bonus tracks, nor does it feature expanded liner notes. It does have great sound, from the original master, and is on 24K gold disc, which is a better medium than alumin(i)um. It reproduces the original liner well."
5,"Stop bashing Audio Fidelity, the problem is your own ignorance about audiophile discs, players, receivers/pre-amps.","IF YOU PLAY HDCD DISCS ON A NORMAL CD PLAYER YOU WILL NOT HEAR THE MUSIC IN HIGH DEFINITION 24BIT/48kHz AUDIO. YOUR CD PLAYER WILL PLAY THE HDCD DISC AT 16BIT/44.1kHz RATE. AND IF YOUR RECEIVER IS NOT HIGH DEFINITION COMPATIBLE IT CONVERTS ALL INPUT AUTOMATICALLY TO 16BIT/44kHz AS DEFAULT BECAUSE IT HAS TO FOR ALL MEDIA, UNLESS YOUR RECEIVER/PRE-AMP IS PRE-DIGITAL. THEN YOU'RE OKAY.SO BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN AND ACCUSE AUDIO FIDELITY OF PRODUCING BAD AUDIO, GET A CLUE AND RESEARCH WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT PLAY ON YOUR SYSTEM.GET YOURSELF EDUCATED AND STOP BLAMING AUDIO FIDELITY AND THE ENGINEERS. IT'S YOUR FAULT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE SOUND YOU WANT BECAUSE OF YOUR OWN IGNORANCE ABOUT AUDIO DISC PLAYERS, AUDIO RECEIVERS/PRE-AMPS, AND HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO.I HAVE MOST OF THE DISCS AND THEY ALL SOUND ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE."
5,Beyond Sweet Home Alabama,"Southern rock legend Lynyrd Skynyrd's second album in 1974 including their most well-known song ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is a nice dumpy swampy and occasionally pop and catchy 70's masterpiece. It could be the second album to get after listening to their greatest hits.I do love Sweet Home Alabama but this song does not well present me how they rock as I have heard from lots of hard rock fans who appreciate this band. I am really glad that I finally have this. Yep, I NEED YOU exactly fit the image of their rock. Deep south blues flavored rock. DON'T ASK ME NO QUESTION is excellently made pop song and THE BALLAD OF CURTIS LOEW really touches me. THE NEEDLE AND THE SPOON is a light mannered anti-drug song. CALL ME THE BREEZE nicely wraps us this album. Boy it could be one of the finest we could get before Synth music dominates the music scene. Their sincere rock style is fresh for us.Paradise for southern rock appreciators and it still catches huge music fans for sure."
2,Doesn't seem accurate and no Nitrate test.,"According to this kit, my pH is somewhere between 7 and 6.5 (a pretty big range) and my KH is 1. I'm trying to figure out the CO2 in my water and if I count my pH as 7 then my CO2 is 3 ppm, but if I count it as 6.5 then my CO2 is 9 ppm (3 times higher!!). The pH test needs finer gradings.My water tastes hard, leaves spots all over my dishes, and my water company says its hard, but this kit says its extremely soft (GH and KH are 1). I'm pretty sure this test is inaccurate here.It also does not have a test for Nitrate which will be important in figuring out what my water changing schedule needs to be.Essentially this kit was a waste of money and I'm going to have to buy another one because I don't believe the results of the hardness tests, the pH test is not accurate enough and there is no test for nitrate."
4,Test is good - for what it does.,"This is a very good test kit with easy to use instructions although it is probably not the best test for a beginning aquarist. I should have read the description a little more closely. This kit does not test for Nitrate, which is something you really need to watch for in an aquarium, especially one that you are cycling. Just be aware of the tests included, some of which are not necessarily the ones needed for initially setting up an aquarium."
5,Best water testing kit!!!,"This product is way better than API product. Although, I do like that the API brand comes with glass test tube and Tetra comes with PLASTIC test tube. The testing solution in Tetra is way more effective and easier to use than the API brand."
4,Whats in this collection?,"I had to e-mail Amazon to find out, here's the list: The Lodger (1926), Easy Virtue (1927, The Ring (1927), The Farmer's Wife (1928), The Manxman (1929), Blackmail (1929), Murder (1930), The Skin Game (1931), Rich and Strange (1932), number 17 (1932), The man who Knew Too Much (1934), the Thirty Nine Steps (1935), The Secret Agent (1936), Sabatoge (1936), Young and Innocent (1937), The Lady Vanishes (1938), Jamaica Inn (1939) and The Sorcerers Apprentice. I personnaly feel his older works are bit slow, bu the ones from the 30's get better. With 15+ movies in one collection - It's worth it."
2,"Very displeasing, but I'll review it","This strange movie where an innocent woman is accused of murder is so bad I even doubt that the Master of Suspense made it. The story has no actual plot, and it has little excitement in the chase for the real murderer.So, since this movie is so bad, that's all I have to say."
4,Hitchcock classics,"These DVS's are great classics to watch, especially on a dark and late night. But I wouldsn't think these DVD's are great. I would go more recent to the 50's and 60's movies. My favorite Hitchcock movie is Rear Window. That will keep you watching."
4,Worth the money,"These shoes are inexpensive, light weight, and very comfortable.They were hard to get on at first. There is a loop on the tongue that holds the laces... I relaced the shoes without using the loop and they went on much easier.I'm happy with them."
3,Pretty Good but Not His Best,I think The World of John Coltrane.He is One Of Musics Greatest Teachers.but Toward the End of His Career His Music was Hit&Miss at best.His Late 50's Stuff with Miles thru Villeage Vanguard&Concert Stuff is a must.but Records Like this while some great playing in Spots such as on Om Go All over the Place Elsewhere.He is one Of The Greatest Genius's that The Music World has ever Heard but You Can't Really Feel The Vibe all the way on this Set.
1,The Emporer's New Clothes?,"I continually hear nothing but how great and gifted a musician John was but when I finally hear his music, I wonder what all the talk is about. Nothing but cacophony here. If you like the sound of several musicians each listening only to his own instrument, then you will like this. Otherwise, you will probably consider this to be pure tripe. I'll stick to more conventional music."
5,Essential,"I have been a Jazz fan for many years, my first hearing of Om took me by surprise. I first heard the many voices and then keyed into the different conversations which at times shared the same idle. Like life I found some conversation in my arena others interesting but still drawn to more interesting ones. The human ear can take in many sounds but will always turn to the ones that feed their need. Om is a track which I have enjoyed over the years, these reviews have reopened my mind by allowing me to see what Coltrane had in mind.I hope others will learn the freedom Coltrane is sharing with us, To all of you, give this another try and open your mind to the real conversations you hear."
2,Runs under vista but won't save for me,I installed the gameupdated to service pack 1installed the patchdeleted the videos (It wouldn't load till I did this)installed the directx drivers(don't know if this was neccessary)and set compatability mode for windows 2000windows NT 4.0 also seems to run.Problem is I can't get it to save.I think it's a really fun game but that the original would have been better if it hadn't been even more buggy. In the original I could never capture ships which made me angry.. And now I can't save.
1,Won't load,"I got this game for $4, but I loaded it up on my Vista laptop and it don't work. I tried the compatiably to XP, but it didn't work. I put it in my XP desktop, loads perfectly, but when I pick a battle the battle won't load or would freeze up mid-battle."
1,Won't load,"Tried loading it, froze up. Downloaded patches- won't run. Think it needs a better computer than I have."
3,It works on Vista,I could not get the game to function on Vista all night. After some research I messed with the several things. Here is what I did to get the game to work on Win Vista:Install SP1 for VistaUpdateded Nvidia DriversSet game exe. file to compatability mode for Win 2000After all that the game worked great. Don't forget to update your game to latest patch.
4,great sailing game,AGE OF SAIL II PRIVATEER'S BOUNTY is a great fun upgrade from AGE OF SAIL. I had AGE OF SAIL II and was disappointed with the game operating flaws. PRIVATEER'S BOUNTY seems to have cleared most of the operating flaws up. I have had only one experience of the scenario messing up and I am not sure it just wasn't my computer. The controls are easy to learn. The game is set in real time or can be speeded up which makes it good for easy going adults and gameboy speed kids. My 11yr old loves the game. I like to be able to teach him tactics. We have 2 copies and the plan is soon to play against each other.
5,Great music,"There is not on song on this cd that is bad. Elegant Machinery are a wonderful synth-pop band. An instant classic and I don't say that just because they sound a bit eighties, but because they have made the classic sounds their own and deserve to be recognized as a true one of a kind act. Buy it."
3,weird voice but cool music.,This guys voice drives me crazy but it grows on you. The songs are catchy. Like erasure with weird vocals but still an overall cool cd.
2,buy the book and forget the CD,"I bought this set to use on my Macintosh (based on the description). It will not work. When I contacted tech support (the publishers email support) I was told it would not work on my Mac and there were no plans to make it work on Macs. Like all Deitel books however, the information is first rate and you will learn the Java language the correct way (both the style and substance)."
1,The Multimedia sound in this tutorial....HURTS!!!,"I'm really sorry Prentice Hall had to be so concerned about taking this product to all possible JAVA platforms. As a result, they chose to use the "".au"" sound format for the ""8+ hours"" of audio on the CD. It is so bad on a PC, the content is virtually unuseable. The book on the otherhand is well done, but is not worth the price if you can't take advantage of the multimedia tutorial."
5,MOVIE,BOUGHT THIS AS A XMAS GIFT FOR MY SON. HE ;LOVED IT AND IT A GREAT GIFT TO SHARE WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY. WE REALLY ENJOYED IT
4,It was a gift,The girl I got this for loves it! She especially loves the behind the out takes and deleted scenes the most
5,motor cycle lover,"awww the 2nd season, they are starting to mesh and the chemistry in the cast is starting to get good. they work so good together and the laughs just keep coming. season 2 has more story line to it and it just keeps expanding well and gets funnier by the episode."
5,Amazing! A Friend of Friends,"This is an amazing TV show. It is funny, and at times can be serious and touching. As you watch ""FRIENDS"", you will make friends that will last you your whole life"
2,Poor picture quality,The quality of the picure is very grainy and not clear even when it is played in a blue ray player with HDMI.
4,Great series! You can't go wrong with Friends...,"This is a series that will lift up your mood anytime. It is not the most elaborate or the smartest of all, but in terms of entertainment, it does the job! I love it, and still laugh after many times of watching it!"
5,"""She's not Rachem!""","Friends - The Complete Second Season really hit the jackpot! This show was mega-popular thanks to The Rachel haircut and of course the talented and irreplaceable cast. I love the season 2, it's hilarious and witty! Lisa Kudrow finally got to shine this season, she was so neglected in season 1, her comic timing is impeccable. The Ross and Rachel storyline was the highlight of the season and Monica's releationship with a much older man, Richard portrayed by Tom Selleck. You've got to pick up season 2, worth every penny. Enjoy!"
1,Boy oh boy!! Just what this country needs,...Another installment of the whinny boring misadventures of the biggest bunch of losers since Thirtysomething. Another group of clueless TV morons that you wouldn't want to be caught dead on the same planet with.Can I give this MINUS 5 STARS?
5,Finally Friends!,Finally!! We can get all the episodes of Friends possible! This is my all time favorite show and I'm so glad that WB has decided to release all the shows on DVD. I really hope they continue to release all the seasons so I can see any episode I want and more. Every episode is full of laughis and the writers and creaters have really made this the best sit-com ever! This Collection is worth the price and will be a great addition to your collection.
5,Friends Review,Friends is the best television show ever. The chemistry of the group is absolutely phenomenal. You'll love every single second of the show. It's so popular because subconciously everyone wants to have that kind of life. Buy this awesome DVD
4,We watch our Freinds continue their journey,"Many celebrities make guest appearances on the second season after they had such high aclaim the first season it seemed impossible to top it. But the second season was just as good if not better than the first season of friends.We watch as Monica deals with the love of an older man, Joey gets a job on Days of Our Lives, Chandler makes is corny jokes, Pheobe is clueless but not and Ross and Rachel try together but they can becuase of many problems. It's the journey through these six characters that makes it so interesting to watch because we can all relate to one or more of them.Bottomline: Freinds season 2 is the next thing to get after season 1."
5,The one where it all happens,"Friends is one of the best comedy around, if not the best.I loved the second season of friends because that every thing started to happen. Ross and Rachel got together, Joey got a job on TV as a Doctor. Joey moved out of the flat (which made Chandler quiet upset.) and back in again. Monica gets together with an older man,and Phoebe was Phoebe doing her own thing. In this season there was many guest stars and manylaughs. So take my word for it buy it and you want stop laughing. Plus there is one or two Emmy to show for it."
3,"This is ""New""? I think not...","I purchased this item listed as ""New"" condition. When I received it, however, the outer cardboard case and inner plastic case were both cracked and torn. It looked like these had been used several times, or at the very least, stored in such a way that they weren't able to be kept in ""New"" condition. Poor condition reporting on the part of the seller."
5,speedy,the package arrived in a good amount of time. i ordered it for christmas and i was very pleased that even with the holiday mail busy season i got it in plenty of time to wrap it.
5,I am the number 1 fan of friends and you can't say you are!,"OMG! I am the number 1 fan of friends. I've seen all the episodes over 20 times, I know practically all the words to all the episodes. I also know all the small details that most people don't like that Rachel's parents payed 40,000$ for the wedding with Barry. Also that Ross is alergic to kiwi. And that Chandler got bit by a peacock at the zoo. Oh and also that Joey has a bed time penguin pal called Hugzie. How many of you know that hu? You seriouslly HAVE to buy this DVD! Friends is the best show that ever walked the planet and I am TOTALLY obsessed."
5,Friends,"I always enjoy sitting at home watching a batch of ""Friends"" and now I can do it in my spare time. I think the second season is a great season to watch and encourage anyone who is considering this product should get their hands on it"
4,A truly heart-felt novel...with a few twists.,"Not only was I intrigued by her much praised poetic style of writing (a rare find in this day & age), but Oliver portrays very well the less-than-perfect famial relationships with which we can all identify. Even back in the early 1900's when things seemed pure and innocent, we can see that the same types of scandals took place and that really, nothing is new under the sun. The author sheds light on the current events and circumstances of the age and provides interesting details about a rural family's upbringing and routine. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a book you can't put down until it starts exploring the mystery of things in depth and then you are lured in by the twisted tales of family secrets which are gradually revealed. During the last half of the book things really pick up and by the end you are left feeling like you yourself are part of the Holloway family."
5,good basic surge protector,"I bought this to plug in a laptop, psp and a lamp. It works fine, feels solid. The cord is thick too. I recommend it."
3,This thing totally protects my surges!,"If there is a power surge, without even asking it to, this little guy protects all my hard earned electronics."
1,Busted,It came busted. Very disappointing. The first time that Amazon did this to me. I didn't bother returning it.
2,Cheap,There is no provisions for mounting the outlet on the back. I suppose you have to just leave it lay on the floor. Never seen one without it!
2,OK,works fine....but probably could find a comparable product for a better price at your local store.
1,caught on fire,almost burned my house down. Don't buy. There was a recall on these. I have picks of it...the whole inside melted. I didn't have anything on it and only two lamps plugged into it.It even burned the floor beneath.
1,FIRE,"It worked well for a number of years. No complaints. It did what it was supposed to do. . .until it didn't. I put my infant to sleep last night and smelled something odd in his room. I quietly looked around (as to not wake him) to discover smoke pouring out of the plug. Belkin's response? ""Sorry, its not under warranty."" Needless to say, use at your own risk!"
1,Worked fine until my computer fried.,"In fairness I'm not sure how much protection this product is supposed to supply but here's what happened.My Imac, my Time Capsule and my Motorola modem were all plugged into it when we had a momentary power outage. The modem and the Time Capsule are fine but the power supply on the Imac had to be replaced.Guess it's time to shell out a few more bucks for a replacement surge protector."
5,Good Solid Surge Protector,"For the price, you can not beat these surge protectors. Belkin is a solid company with a good reputation. If you do not need all the fancy colors or designs, then this one will work great for you. It only has a 4 foot cord, but if you do not need a long one, then this one will suit you fine."
3,Works good,"I have not had any complaints until now. The product works very fine.But when i look into other products in the shops and in markets, i feel this product is over priced."
2,Not what I expected,"When I purchased this product I thought I was getting a black fabric mesh that adhered to the blacktop when covering the cracks. Instead, it's a black mesh plastic-like fabric with big holes that goes over the cracks and then you still have to apply blacktop coating over it. I thought there were no holes and that the fabric covers the cracks. I wasn't planning on purchasing additional materials and having more work to do. If I'm going to fill in the cracks I might as well just fill them in with blacktop filler. I notice that many companies and/or Amazon don't provide enough description of the product to know exactly what you're getting - such was the case with this item. I didn't return the product because I would not get my shipping costs refunded, so it wouldn't be worth it."
5,"""PRACTICE SAFE CELLULAR""","This is one of the easiest products I have seen yet! It's as easy as plug and talk. All you have to do is plug it into the jack and begin speaking. It is also very comfortable and light weight. Don't miss out on this great gift idea for all your friends with cell phones. ""STICK IT IN YOUR EAR!"""
1,Great accessory that doesn't work with my 8260,"I had a Jabra EarSet for my old Nokia 5160 and it worked BEAUTIFULLY! I upgraded my phone to the 8260 and purchased the ""compatible"" Jabra. The phone recognized that a headset was connected, but I could only hear extremely faint sound coming from the earpiece (yes, the volume was turned up all the way). Went back to the store to try more of the same Jabra units with no luck. I'm stuck with the Nokia factory headset which sounds fine, but nobody can hear me talk..."
3,man,this would be AWESOME if it wasnt for the singer. the guitars sound PERFECT. the singer sounds like godsmack or something.
1,Warning to potential buyers of this product!,"The product in the picture looks wonderful, and that's why I purchased it. But, what the company actually ships is extremely different from the picture and very disappointing for the price I paid. It was just a sheer purple material with gold coins attached by some crocheting. Had I wanted something so flimsy I would have paid much less and gone somewhere else. If you are looking for a quality belt, this is not the belt you are looking for.The company should be ashamed for it's false advertisement. Showing a customer one product and then sending another just show that they don't value their customers and have no problem taking their money and lying to them."
3,It does keep away the mosquitoes but...,"Leaves a disgusting sticky film on your dog that won't let you pet him freely or get indoors without leaving remnants of the product. Plus it lasts just for a day, so you'll have sticky looking smelly dogs without mosquitoes."
2,Didn't last long for a terrier,"Disclaimer: I have a very aggressive tearer. My border terrier that loves to take any stuffed toy and tear it open. He holds the toy down with his paws and begins pulling on it with his teeth.When I received this product, I was hopeful - it feels very sturdy and well made. So I left it with my 10 month old pup and within a few hours, he had it completely torn open, stuffing and squeaker out and flung all over the floor.If you are looking for a stuffed toy that holds up to a dog that likes to bite and tear stuffed toys, I would keep looking (and let me know if you find one!)"
4,Survived tug-of-war...for a while anyway!,"This toy is well-made with quality materials and I was confident about giving it to my dogs who are very rough on toys. Tug-of war is their favorite game, so very few toys last more than a few weeks. But the monkey survived eight or nine months. Well done!"
3,"O.K. , But Nothing Special","A private eye novel in the ""Spenser"" mold, Lullaby Town is a typical genre novel that doesn't do anything to distinguish itself from the dozens of other detective series out there. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book, but if you read a lot of detective fiction, there's nothing new here."
3,Intersting main character outweighs slighly ordinary plot,"Robert Crais' detective, Elivs, is a sharply drawn character whose persona and background are very funny. This is a fun book to read, but the details of the plot didn't contain many amazing twists and turns. Still, the book was enjoyable. Elvis is the kind of person you would love to grab a beer with, and I can't say that about many characters in novels that I have read."
4,Great book,"I have recently become a Crais fan and I could not put this one down. The hero, Cole, is called upon by a rich yet annoying film director to locate his estranged wife and son. However, the more he finds out about the ex-wife, the more dangerous his mission becomes and he then has to enlist his old friend, Pike, to keep him out of harm's way. Definitely a good book with strong dialogue."
1,Elvis goes to New York--Don't follow him.,By far the weakest entry in Crais' excellent Elvis Cole series. Leaving his familiar LA terratory Cole encounters stereotyped mafiosa and a New York and Connecticut as three dimentional as a Hagstrom map. Only read this while you're waiting for the next Elvis Cole to come out in paperback.
2,A real waste of time,When you read a book with 320 or so pages and the thrilling part is written in less than 150 is a waste of time no-matter how good is the thrilling part.
5,Outstsnding,One of his best and I've read most of his. Like it when he includes Jo pike. Fraudis the best!
4,"Still good, still the best private eye in town...","This is not Crais' best, but another worthy entry into the Cole-Pike series. This one, interestingly, takes place in the mafia world and NY/CT/NJ tri-state area. It is a good jolt to have the story--a darkish one--take place out there. The characters remain fresh and we even have some visits from some old characters (I love this--always great to reward long time fans with visits from characters from other books). Cole is still a mystery at this point (unlike Bosch, we don't know much about him yet and I'm reading the books in order). My only criticism of this volume is that Peter Alan Nelsen is a little too cartoonish for my tastes, but otherwise, a great book."
4,Good! Good!,"Elvis Cole, private investigator, was tasked by a famous director, Peter, to find his ex-wife and son. A seemingly simple assignment soon turned out to be mission impossible. After locating Karen and Toby, Elvis soon uncovered that the former was owned by the mafia, who would not be at all happy with the interference of Elvis and his partner, Joe Pike. Being his usual righteous self, Elvis could not sit back and see Karen's life destroyed by the mob. However, could he and Joe take on the mafia, save Karen from its clutches, and escape unscathed?Like all other Robert Crais' books, it had the compelling power which made it impossible for me to put the book down. I have always believed that for a book to be likeable, we must like the characters in the book and really feel for them. This is precisely the reason which I enjoy this book so much. I was rooting for Elvis and Joe all the way as I followed the story which simply took my breath away."
4,Lullaby Town,I thourghly enjoyed this book along with all of the Crais series featuring Elvis Cole and Joe pike. Very entertaining I recommend to anyone looking for a fun read.
4,Elvis Does New York,"Foregoing his familiar LA turf, Robert Crais ventures to New York City and the sleepy Connecticut suburb of Chelam in this offbeat and entertaining mystery. Private investigator Elvis Cole is in his best wisecracking form, while Joe Pike's stoic form is always there exactly when needed. The change in venue was a refreshing change of pace, and the east coast-west coast banter was humorous and effective, as Crais succeeds in poking fun at both the shallowness of Hollywood and the brutishness of the east coast crime families. Despite a typically dark and threatening plot, Crais keeps the pace light and the one-liners flowing, building up steam towards an exciting - if not particularly surprising - climax. All in all, a more than satisfying read, and well worth the time invested."
2,"When it Doesn't Work, Don't Expect the Lifetime Warranty to Mean Anything","I used my SurgeMaster for 6 years and it either did it's job, or I didn't need it. Living in an area with a lot of power failures, I always have some concern about surges. When we had a power failure last December, it took out the power supply on my Macintosh (as well as my brand new Trivection ovens). Luckily, replacing the Mac power supply wasn't an expensive repair. I sent a claim into Belkin for the repair, and it was denied because they found nothing wrong with the SurgeMaster. I guess it was just a coincidence that my power supply died at the time of a power outage. ;-) Needless to say, I won't be buying any other Belkin products any time soon."
4,AN LP AND A HALF,This is a good reissue. The complete original STATEMENTS session with Hank Jones leading the rhythm section plus several selections from a later session with Tommy Flanagan in for Jones and the Tenor Sax of Jimmy Heath added to the group. Vocal tunes from the later session have been mercifully omitted. JAZZ&SAMBA was the name of that session. The Jazz portion is herewith preserved.
5,Rob Zombie rules,What can I say? Excellent price and even better quality. As you can see the price is right. You won't find a better offer.
3,My first LPD exposure,"I'm brand new to LPD and this album was my first exposure to them. Though I respect their poetic and musical skill, this particular album is a little too dated for my personal taste. Of course, it was released in 1987 so I have to expect a little bit of that. I enjoy this album but if you are brand new to LPD as I was, you may want to try something slightly more recent, such as Maria Dimension"
5,Great Union 13 Album.,"this album i got it at my sophmore year in high school and the song a lifes story made me cry because the lyrics are very powerfull and very life changing because these men were gagnsters ans they had no point to be people killing each other for territory and made the band hes life, you wont regret it if youll buy this album."
3,Ethics of Nature Photography,"Five of the 20 postcards in this book are scenes from the state of South Carolina. The Appalachian Trail goes through 14 states, but SC doesn't happen to be one of them. If a publisher can get away with moving an entire state, how can we trust that their nature photographers don't move leaves and twigs for better compositional effect?"
1,stopped working in a week,"what can I say. This one held so much promise.I liked the capacity, the controls, the price, the output and the looks.I was especially thrilled about the heating element. It was not the typical ring type that makes it so hard to reach and clean. This one is a flat plate.But alas, less than 1 week into it, it simply stopped powering on. My search for a humidifier continues ..."
2,Poor design,"The design is my main critique for this. I had this for 2 days, and on the second day, the water container broke as I was filling it up. there is no handle on the bottom side, and it doesn't stand up by itself. So, I was holding onto it from the side, and right as I was lifting it up from my tub, it slipped, and the container cracked.2 days.*sigh*"
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this unit on a recommendation from my doctor who said the warm moisture humidifiers are better. I bought it, it ran beautifully for an hour and then just quit, stopped working, doesn't power it up, no nothing."
2,Honey -Oh Well Quick Steam,I purchased two over a year ago. Both are working fine but I guess to due to the quality of my water it scales up and is a ENORMOUS pain to clean. It is noisy and a pain to fill because when you flip the container it is not designed to stand alone. In the end I am selling them both and the year supply of filter pads on craigs list and having a whole humidifier installed instead.
1,Not Satisfied,"I purchases this humidifer less than a month ago and it already does not work. I will contact Amazon and see what they are willing to do about my sitation.Product worked for the first 3 weeks, now nothing.Honeywell QuickSteam Warm Humidifier HWM-335"
3,This is OK. It works as it is suppose to.,"This humidifier works as you would expect. The mineral build-up on theheating plate can be easily removed using vinegar, as stated in the manual.Design of the water container makes it difficult to fill water. It doesn't stand on it own, and there isn't a handle to hold when you are filling water.The sound of boiling water is a little louder than I have expected (at night)."
1,"Heating Element burnt, started leaking in less than 2 months.","Initially functioned well and sure enough, after less than two months the heating element burned out, the unit started leaking. The manufacturer refuses to respond to emial or offer support on this crappy product. Amazon, will surely loose customers if they resell such productsI DEFINITELY don't recommend this product."
4,Good buy,"This unit runs very quietly. Only occasionally do you hear a ""gulp"" noise as water leaves the reservoir. But this seems to be very quiet compared to the loud noise that some Vornados make when water leaves the reservoir. The heating plate collects a lot of mineral deposit, but this of course varies depending on your water source. It seems like it requires cleaning once a week for my water. This humidifier provides a lot of moisture (3 gallons in 12 hours if on the highest setting) and has helped reduce dry skin problems."
2,Doesn't Last,"The product works great but doesn't last. After 6 months, the heating element burns out. Manufacturer replaced the damaged item, but the new one burnt out in 6 months. It cost about $20 to ship it back. Not worth the hassle a second time around."
2,Noisy and only good for a year,"This unit is not for the bedroom as it spits, bubbles and gurgles. Mine also only lasted a year and the warrantee is not worth the paper it's printed on. The controls are counter intuitive and the humidistat doesn't work well. The mineral pads are also very expensive and hard to find. I replaced it with a cheap $10 Holmes unit (on sale) which is just as good"
2,Honeywell HWM-335 QuickSteam 3-Gallon Warm Moisture Humidifier,"Keep looking. This is VERY awkward to fill. Those with grip strength issues will never be able to handle. If you have hard water, find the filters in bulk. Will do an adequate job in small spaces. I got mine at an extremely good price, they have gone up since then, I wouldn't do it over again, even at the lower cost."
4,good humidifier product,"Works great at humidifying a large area of the home. A little awkward to fill(you have to hold it), but does fit under kitchen faucet.Mineral build-up minimized with the pads; however the heating plate can be cleaned up with Lime-away or similar product by soaking it a shprt time. I would recommed this product."
3,"Works well, poorly designed",The water reservoir can't sit flat while filling and so must be supported the entire time. The humidifier has an interlock formed by a plastic peg in the power section. This was not long enough to reliably push the switch in the base. After gluing a thin layer of cardboard to the plastic peg the unit works well and reasonably quietly. Not worth the current price of $60.
1,"Good Design, but VERY Poor Quality","I liked the design of the unit, and initially it functioned well. It quietly puts out a lot of moisture. Construction quality seemed flimsy, and sure enough, after less than three months the heating element burned out. The manufacturer will replace the unit, if it finds a defect in material or workmanship. However, you must pay shipping and $15.00 for their time; not really worth the hassle.I don't recommend this product."
1,not much good,Product only worked for about a week.I sent it back and amazon refunded all my money including shipping. Honeywell used to make good humidifiers but no longer.I wish they would come back with the model # 2030. I used this model for years and was well satisfied with it.
1,Don't waste your $ on this product!,"Mine ran great for about 5 days when I set it up in mid-January 2007, then quit running (wouldn't power up). I cleaned it, followed all the troubleshooting instructions, nothing, nada.Do not waste your money on this!Honeywell used to make great products, but this unit is made overseas with a different technology.I'm swearing off Honeywell products until they get their act together again!"
1,Junk - don't buy it,Bought this product (not from Amazon) it broke after about a week - I've tried about every humidifier out on the market - the BEST by far is anything made by Air-o-swiss.. Period. I'm on the same one for the second season and we're buying another for our daughter. They are WORTH every cent.
3,Basic Intro Level Book,"This is a good book if you are new to the industry, either as a student or as practitioner. The book covers nearly all relevant subjects. Herein lies the problem. Everything is covered, but there is no real focus or depth.If you need more than the basics, you will have to look elsewhere.To summarize, if you need a toolkit or a how to do guide, this book is not it. If you need a basic intro level book, then the book will do.

4,One of the best lexicons of a Native American language ever.,"Cyrus Byington was a missionary who lived among the Choctaw of Oklahoma in the mid 19th century. He set out to construct a lexicon of the Choctaw language in order to translate many Christian prayers, hymns, and bible passages into Choctaw. What resulted was one of the most complete lexicons for a Native American language that exists today. Dictionary is not complete however, and many of the words do indeed date the work. However the work itself has two parts; an English-Choctaw, and a Choctaw-English component. A must have for anyone interested in languages."
4,Choctaw Dictionary,"Considering it was written in 1909, this is a very good dictionary. It shares some of the flaws common to all older dictionaries, such as odd omissions and a lack of sophistication in the entries. It does have a pronunciation guide and a few grammatical notes, unlike many older dictionaries. Very interesting from a historical perspective. If you're interested in learning to speak Choctaw yourself, I recommend the language learning CD-ROM at ISBN# 0806133791, but you wouldn't go wrong having both."
5,great referance book,I like the fact that this dictionary is from English to Choctaw and Choctaw to English
3,It's ok,"I have bought this product for years. But, I think that because this product is discontinued, the one I purchased online is not as ""fresh"" as others I have bought in the past."
5,wella,love what this does for my super thick/straight hair--Seller is great to do business with he's A+++
1,Format of DVD a problem,This may be a wonderful recording but I will never know. Neither a DVD video player nor a DVD audio player could decode the disc.
5,Promise Unfulfilled,theaudience was a fine band and it's a shame they never caught on in the U.S. This sampler didn't help: too many experimental b-sides and not enough of their splendid British singles. Perhaps Sophie Ellis-Bextor's solo career will do better; her first album is due out fall 2001.
1,Unacceptable Amount of Errors in Manual,"I wanted to add my findings of this book. I am an instructor at a technical college and this book was selected due to it's graphic and layouts. On the surface, it looks like a well done publication. Once you start using it for a guide, it becomes nothing short of a nightmare. This book has more than an acceptabe amount of errors in it. The files that are enclosed with the book more times than not do not coordinate with the book. There are too many incorrect statements and just plain wrong examples to count.Besides the errors, this book picks very complex examples in which to explain new concepts.I would strongly encourange anybody that is serious about learning Microsoft Access to purchase another publication.Overall Rating: Thumbs down!"
2,""" this is not it... """,""" this is not it... "" G. BARTO reviewer accurately said. The best Breton / English , English Breton dictionary that I know of, is the"" brezhoneg saozneg / english breton Geriadur divyezhek / Bilingual dictionary"" by Raymond Delaporte / Remon Ar Porzh.

5,Chris Broach goes his own way,Braid broke up. I was sad. The Firebird Band came from the ashes of braid. I was happy. Christopher Broach has gone a decidedly different path than the post emo indie rock road he took with Braid. And he's gone a different path than Robert Nanna did with Hey Mercedes. Dare I say he's treading into new(er) territory. There's drum machines..multi layered drum tracks...and many more surprises. The lyrics are amazing. It seems that they weave together a story and the track selection adds a great sense of continuity to the album. I've discovered many great bands lately and this is one of the best. The guitar work is phenomenal and inventive and the vocals are great. If you wanna hear Chris Broach sing (and not scream) buy this..and while your at it buy the Hey Mercedes EP and every Braid album you can get your hands on.
3,worth a listen,"this is a really cool cd. the music is energetic, but contains alot of restraint and allows a pure pop sensibility to shine within the angular frame of the songs. the tunes are drenched in melody and yet have enough creative flourishes to keep the interest of even the most jaded listener. if i had to make a comparison, i would say The Setting Sun And It's Satellites would fit into place alongside the sound of Rob Crow's band, Pinback."
1,awful,"Bought one of these, it worked just fine for about a month, and then the connection became skippy, I tested it against another cord, which worked just fine so it was definitely this cable. It's super cheap, but still not worth the money."
1,the cable i received was NOT CL2 rated,"i'm sure this cable works fine, but the one i received was NOT CL2-rated. the description on the packing slip claimed it was, but the cable had no ""CL2"" markings on it. generally when a you buy a cable that is CL2 rated, it will be printed on the cable, the one i received did NOT have CL2 printed on it. so, if you're looking for a CL2 rated cable for in-wall usage, i wouldn't go w/ this one.i contacted the seller. in the first email, they said it should work fine and to go ahead and use it. then when said it was NOT CL2 rated, they asked me to return it for refund, but i would not get my shipping back."
3,Hardluck Outfit,"Originally published at George C. Marshall's request as part of the War Department's American Forces in Action series, this short monograph provides the basic unit history of the famous (or infamous) 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) -better known as ""Merrill's Marauders."" During its brief existence, the 5307th - a longe-range penetration unit of American light infantrymen - carried the war to the Japanese in northern Burma, tugging behind its Chinese allies. This slim volume is replete with excellent maps, TO&E info and many candid photos of the ragged, rugged Marauders. All in all, one sad, heroic tale of some undervalued dogfaces in one of Worl War II's worst theaters. I highly recommend those interested also take a look at Hopkin's SPEARHEAD and Ogburn's THE MARAUDERS. You might also catch the old ""Merrill's Marauders"" with Jeff Chandler on late night TV."
2,disappointed,"I have to say that after hearing the albums Spiritual Unity, Vibrations, and The Hilversum Session...I was hooked on Ayler's music. I decided that my next purchase would be ""Love Cry""--I did about cry after hearing it. I have tried so many times to let this music ""grow on me"", but three years later, and I still don't care for it. I just don't like the""marching band"" style of music that is prevalent on this cd."
3,"Ok, but nothing special","The novel features a magician's apprentice and a strapping warrior who ride off to rescue an enchanted sleeping damsel. Although this pretense for the story is unoriginal, the actual plot of the novel is distinct enough to keep it interesting. I found the first half of the novel (rescuing the damsel) very dull, but found the second half enjoyable.The characters are not fleshed-out enough to endear themselves to the reader, but they are well-constructed enough to avoid the 2-dimensional quality that can often haunt this type of stock fiction.As a whole, the book is nothing special. It's not entertaining enough to be recommendable, but if you're fishing through a pile of pulp fiction to find something to read before bed, it's better than most of the other books you will probably find."
4,well worth a read,"This book's a charming story. True, it uses nearly all the cliches of the genre (talking cat and horse, imprisoned princess, inexpert wizard's apprentice, etc.), yet Dexter crafts her characters with evident love and nuance that make the book extremely readable and a lot of fun. The relationships ring true as well. I heartily recommend it and the rest of the trilogy as a wonderful entrance or return to enchanting, lighthearted, elegant yet earnest adventure."
4,Unclassically Original,"Intelligent, humorous and beautiful. Allaire, the beautiful ruler-to-be, is sought by all. But once freed from her enchanted sleep the WinterWastes, the story by far doesn't end there!Tristan, the wizard's appentice that freed her after the death of his mentor, master, and foster-parent Blaise, is both main character and co-comedy relief. He, like the big burly Polassar who accompanies him on his... no, on THE Quest, vies for the stunningly beautiful Allaire,but she will have no part of him, save servant. She's not rude, just unnoticing.Elisena is the true surprise of the story. Her joined involvement with the group shows plainly how shallow the fair Allaire truely is. Elisena's healing knowledge and power makes her invaluble, yet her bloodline worries our Polassar.Is she(Elisena) indeed a changeling? Not to be trusted, though she has more than proven herself? Or merely another mortal, like themselves... another useful road servant for the trav! el-weary Allaire?"
3,Its a sign,"Well it was smaller than I thought, took forever to ship, a little overpriced. Otherwise it looks nice on my garage door."
4,"Go to troy-bilt, its cheaper","Good product, but expensive.. its $13.72 with free shipping on Troy-bilt's site.. so why pay more?"
4,you don't have this allready?,"If you are a front 242 fan, i mean a real fan, go ahead and spend the 13 bucks on this cd. i got my original print version at a used cd store for 4 bucks so 13 is steep. but to brag about your cd collection you should consider this one. its from 1988, pre headhunter days, back when electonic music was in the infant stage of greatness, but it still rules."
4,P.J. Olsson - Great New Artist,"A very excellent new cd, blends techo with great vocals. This cd shouldn't be passed up. P.J. has a great voice and doensn't let it be covered up by the beats. Great guitar playing also can be heard through out the cd."
4,Pretty Good CD,"Visine is the best song on the soundtrack becuase the PJ Olson creates musical harmony. Pray I don't die and She's Got Eyes are also good songs. I gave this four stars becuase it is a good cd, and I didn't give it five becuase that would mean all the songs would have to be great. Overall it is a good cd to buy. --Critic--"
3,SHORT SONGS,"I enjoyed the music on this CD for the most part but feel that the songs are just not long enough. There are 45 tunes on this single CD. Many of the songs are less than 1 minute long. I realize that the short songs were written for fast moving movie scenes and were perfect for that purpose, but for listening while driving or relaxing at home the songs are just too brief."
2,Not my cup of tea,"The seller did a great job of getting this CD to me. This is the ""new"" Lamb group is rock the old Lamb group was more folk. My preference is folk and I'm not too crazy about rock; therefore, I did not care for the album but my friend I gave it to loves it!"
5,Great,"I have always liked Cheka's voice, but have never been a big fan. He has always been able to keep his own style and this album definitely shows it. ""Faltas"" is a great way to start the album. The song just hypes you up. ""Entrar a tu corazon"" is another cool song. One of the best ballads on the album is definitely ""Por ti."" It's very full of emotion and you can see the extremities of love in the lyrics. ""Come back"" is a great R&B track and definitely sets him up for a cross-over. ""Naci"" shows more of his versatility. After listening to the album I definitely have to say Cheka made a great album. He definitely distinguished himself from many other Reggaeton artists. Whether it's love songs or just something to dance to, this is the album."
2,Uneven,"""A camel is a horse designed by a comittee."" That is an apt description of this, Lee Presson and the Nails's second CD. It seems to be pulled in two different directions. On the one hand, you've got Lee Presson's great original songs like ""Hat Back Boogie"" and ""That only Happens in the Movies,"" which is reminiscent of Indigo Swing. But the original songs that Lee didn't write just don't seem to fit. Leslie Presley sounds beautiful as always, and she does her best with Larry Sweeny's ""He's still a Mystery to Me"" and ""Shadowman"" but they still sound like they were written for another band. Ironic, since the songs that WERE written for other bands, like Elvis Costello's ""Wave a White Flag"" and the Stones' ""Jumping Jack Flash"" (!!) are the high points here. I guess they were pressured to have more original songs but face it boys, it's better to have a good cover song than a bad original song. This CD has both.I think their latest CD, ""El Bando En Fuego!"" is their best."
3,This cd wasn't the best of lee press on nails,"Being a fan of lee press on nails,I must admit this wasn't one of their better album. The first album was excellent i did enjoy how it was about the swing music, and kept the music a live and moving. I felt this album was dull and made me want to turn it off after i got to the second song. Because i felt the musical element of the band wasn't there, this more an expermintal art piece than a real album. I yet to buy their new album because i am afraid of what it would sound like. Hopefully better than this album."
2,Swing is dead,"HO-HUM....guess it's O.K. if your a goth, cover and lyrics are truly twisted, If someone gives it to you it's worth a listen, don't spend good money on it."
3,Waysted Live,This album was recorded in a bar (Cardiff) There is some echo because its a bar but the songs still rock. There are a few UFO songs on this CD which Finn stumbles through. Not bad
4,Great undiscovered band,"I purchased this on lp twice, once when it first came out and again in the early eighties when it was rereleased. This band had great potential yet never attained it. This lp is the better of the 2 lps the band made. Some tight musicianship throughout and some excelent guitar playing. If I remember correctly this band came from Cincinnati. They and the Bears are Cincinnati's contribution to progressive rock. The album sounds more like early Wishbone Ash with a touch of Rush. I can't recomend paying the exhorobiat price people are asking. So if I can get my web based radio station up and running again tune in I'll give the lp a full spin one night."
2,"Comfy on the back, but inner lining tore from seam after 5 uses.","There is definitely comfort here and I've worn it on the small of my back or lower for several long runs (12-14 miles each), but after my last run I noticed the inner lining has torn from the seams. The rest of the pack is intact but given I've barely used it, it's a bit quick for anything to tear."
5,Nice,"I thought this would be really big, but it was perfect for my needs. I walk my dog and didn't want a huge fanny pack. This carries my things in a very form fitting way, almost completely flat."
4,I like it.,"It is big enough for a cell phone and key, or cell phone and a pack of gum, and yet small enough that it lies pretty flat. Seems to be well made."
5,Big enough to carry my Sprint EVO with extended Battery,"Excellent product & large enough to carry my Sprint Evo with the Seidio extended battery while I run. I have two, one for my locker & one for home. (the Evo with the large battery is not suitable for putting on your arm)"
3,Smaller than I thought,"My fat wallet couldn't fit in this fanny pack. This is more to hold a small set of keys (my fat key chain fits, but takes a lot of space) and cash/ID/credit card taken out of your wallet. There's a separate slot with velcro for the purpose of holding cash/ID/credit card without the wallet. You can also squeeze in your cell phone and some other small items (i.e. inhaler) but it's a tight fit. Definitely small and doesn't take much space on your back."
2,Wilton-Armetale,"I have a number of pieces of this pattern of Wilton-Armetale that I've been collecting since I got a piece for a house-warming gift years ago. I have to say that it's not exactly the same as the ""original"" pieces as it's no where near as heavy or well made. I just purchased another piece from a vendor and will see if it's similarly made when it arrives. If that piece isn't as I've come to know the product and they have, in fact, ""outsourced"" their manufacturing to a company with less product/manufacturing/quality, I won't be getting any more pieces. The egg tray is just as represented, same pattern, same finish, just much more light-weight and no where near as impressive as I've come to expect."
4,Just right,"I am happy to say, I find the deviled egg tray, weight, balance, and finish just right. The weight of a piece, for its intended purpose is all important for deviled eggs, to say nothing of the finish. Having several wonderful pieces of the Wilton Armetale Flutes & Pearls, I was glad to find this tray to match. I love the durability, flexibility and function of these Wilton pieces. The performance speaks for itself. Like others, sterling is not my thing. It's great to have something attractive, and not have to be so worried about it! It is, just right."
4,EXPRESSION: still exploring,"the album starts off with a beautiful piece called ""Ogunde"" which is just dripping with otherwordly serenity. it's a splendid opening song with a dark overtone swirling around a slight african melody. it gets a little rough on the next track ""To Be"" which basically just sounds like Coltrane is trying to figure out how to properly play a flute. it could be almost described as ""psychadelic jazz"" with a ghostly off key vibe that really doesn't make an impact. it's an interesting historical audio piece, but not essential. the remaining three tracks are quite stellar and offer a fascinating glimpse into the sounds that Coltrane was exploring in the later years of his life. there is a unmistakeable peace to these recordings that showcase John's gentle side in his quest for spiritual sound. a great collection of wonderful songs, but Expression is probably only recommended for the experienced Coltrane listener."
5,His Last Outing Is Great,"This is John Coltrane's last recorded outing beefore his unfortunate death at the age of 40. The music on this album is awesome. The jazz is rather improvisational, with John Coltrane busting out on some awesome solos. Fans of John Coltrane shouldn't pass this one up."
3,Where Trane was headed!,"I hate it when people say this album doesn't give a clue where trane would go. IT DOES!!! Trane would have gone wherever his muse led him. If that means pick up a flute on the overlong ""To Be"" thats what he would do.What disappoints me about this collection of tracks from at different sessions is the fact that Coltrane had a hand in choosing the tracks right before his death. With Stellar Regions containing (in my opinion) much better material, why were these particular tracks chosen. Ogunde and Offering are spectacular while To Be is a very long experiment.Fans of Avant Garde music tend to give everything ""out"" 5 stars. I think we have to base each set on its own merits."
3,"IMPULSE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?","OK, the music may be wonderful, a spiritual experience and all that, but what my fellow rewiers have forgotten to warn potential buyers about is the fact that this album needs to be remastered as soon as possible - one need only listen to the version of 'offering' released on 'stellar regions' to understand what i'm talking about. In other words: if you are into Rashid Ali's drumming, definetely do not buy this one, for he's the one to suffer most with the poor quality of the sound - his cymbals are hardly audible and, in a general sense, it's as if he were doing some 'percussion' sounds, instead of really thrashing his kit off.End result: COLTRANE AND BAND 5 STARS - IMPULSE 2 STARS = 3 STARS"
5,Its Banging,This CD is better than Mac10'S no wonder mac 10 uses him.He looks so cute Im feeling the song Stuck in the game.I also like Hoodsta for life.Keep it real Trey You'll get those Millions soon
4,Battery for days,"No memory, and hassle free battery. Charging time a bit lengthy (3h) but than it last forever. Why don't they sell it with it and have satisfied customers"
4,Exactly what you would expect (in a good way),An exact copy of the extra cap battery I bought with my timeport two years ago. Hold a good charge and does what you want.My last battery is still pretty good (about 65% of what the new battery does) and I use it very often. I expect the same of this one.
4,Missing a few things,"This is a fantastic album, though it is incomplete. According to Amiri Baraka, who was instrumental in getting Impulse to produce this album, Sun Ra's performance was left off the LP without explanation. In addition, Baraka wrote the original liner notes which don't seem to be included in the CD version (I haven't laid hands on the CD yet). Ah well, great music but an incomplete package...what else would a musigeek complain about?"
1,Flys On,"Biting fly's don't seem to be repelled by this product. On the other hand, mosquitos seem to be less assertive."
1,DID NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT,"First, bottle I received had leaked into the packaging, the label was unreadable and more thqn half was gone. I called customer service and they sent another bottle. When I received the new bottle, I did not like this product, the warnings on the label made me decide not to use it. I was afraid it could potentially harm my dogs. It wasn't worth the risk of using it. I WILL NOT BUY THIS AGAIN."
5,"""like a rose""","Much of the appeal of listening to Lucinda Williams is that she is without attention to mechanics in her singing and without pretense. The songs on this album honestly express life, and LW sings with attention to expression rather than to technicality.Some of the experiences I hear in her songs are joy, fun, anger, courage, longing, pain, self-respect, humor...the list goes on...and in ""Side of the Road,"" which on this album has both studio and live versions, she explores a question everyone can ask at some point. You should get this and make some discoveries you'll enjoy. If you like to hear someone sing with soul, you'll like this. Real talent speaks for itself."
3,lucinda williams,"the true test of ms. williams genius is the fact that so many artists have found her songs strong enough to cover. But the most compelling aspect of her songs is the fact that when she sings them herself, the resulting product is absolutely sublime. I love mary chapin-carpenter, but 'passionate kisses', sung in ms.williams voice, is truly a work of art. 'side of the road', with its beautiful violin chorus, is almost too much to describe in words. Let me try. You been in love recently, real love? this tells it all. Worthy of literary criticism, worthy of a slot on the soundtrack of your life. if your lucky enough to get the live version, a little longer and slower, you can consider yourself a lucky person. reminds me of dylan, really. take your divas and your wanna be's, this womans voice speaks in the language of the soul."
5,Lucinda Wm's,"She's Blues,Rock,Folk,Country An All Around Artist Start HereTo Begin Your Lucinda Experience"
5,"The Perfect ""Country"" Masterpiece","Buy this CD! Look.. I like Wilco. I like Uncle Tupelo. This, however, is the REAL ""alt.country"" you've been looking for. The songs are catchy. The lyrics are amazing. You'll find yourself closing your eyes to imagine a beautiful blue Sunday sky. You'll feel the warmth of the sun wrapping you in its embrace. You'll want to hop in that convertible and head off into the country to laugh and play.This is the real thing.."
5,"love the album Lucinda Williams, and it was in perfect condition.","The album Lucinda Williams came with in the time that they said. It was a used item and it was in perfect condition. I love ordering from Amazon, customer service is great and you can call them if you have a problem. I feel as a buyer I was respected and taken care of."
4,she's the real thing,"Wow. A great, influential recording. A four and a half plus scoring, but such is not tallied here. This is all-American in content and character, as her other efforts, including the great new ""Car wheels on a gravel road"". My 2 year old loves all of Lucinda's music and so do I. ""Side of the road"" is worth the price of admission alone. Leaves me speechless. Nice that the new disc repeats it twice - never tire of it. All those snobby critics aren't wrong in this case, she is truly great. I wish her much success in the future."
4,Nobody covers Luci better than Luci!,"If you think Mary Chapin Carpenter(Passionate Kisses) and Tom Petty(Changed the Locks) were good, you should hear the originals. ""Lucinda Williams"" is the album that builds up to deliver the greats - ""Car Wheels,"" ""Essence,"" and ""World Without Tears."" Any serious Lucinda Williams fan will own this cd."
2,Pretty Stones but not functional,"I teach elementary school and the students love to play mancala. I needed to replace some stones so I ordered these. UNLIKE the photo, the stones are of various sizes. Many of them are too large for any of my mancala games. They are also too large for little hands. I can use them for other counting games. However, given a choice, I would not order them again."
3,Slightly bigger than advertised,"I bought these for D&D; purposes, and they're advertised as 1/2 of an inch across. They're mostly around 3/4 of an inch, so if you're planning to use them for the same purpose, consider that while they fit into a 1x1 inch grid they occupy a lot of it.Otherwise, probably one of the best ways to get different color stones fast."
3,Didn't answer MY question,"I hadn't read anything of Walsh's before this book, but this one was recommended to me. I found it more fulfilling than say ""The Shack"", but not as ""meaty"" as books by Emmett Fox. It's worth reading. He addresses many issues that confront us every day and there's merit in the information he's presenting. That said, it's not a book that I'm going to look to for spiritual inspiration; which beyond my friends recommendation, is the only reason I read this book."
1,Embarrassing,This book is a mishmash of banal trivialities alternating with the author's relentless self-aggrandizement. Don't waste your money.
1,Flake,"This book is supposedly a great theological mandate, a revolution of spirituality. Yeah, ok. You will get more spirituality out of a Speed Racer re-run.Packaging up pantheism and a firm belief in relative truths and shipping it out like it is some new concept is silly. I don't have any problem with people expressing their theological beliefs and I don't think Walsch presents a horrible concept here...but it is veiled under the lie that this is some ""God-given"" writing. This is nothing but new age, do what you like, we are all God, CrackerJack-prize spirituality.But you know, whatever gets you through the day I guess."
4,Conversations with God addendum,"After reading the original Conversations with God series I thought I had read all there was to know about this topic and truly believed this of all the many books on spirituality was from God,until I read Friendship With God. That presented even more extremely valuable, usable information, which prompted me to read What God Wants. I am amazed how much new information is shared in this book. It starts out as a reminder of previous ideas, but ends with techniques I have since used with unbelievable success. Our thoughts really do determine our lives, not the reverse."
5,What God Really Wants - and it's not what you think!!,"As usual, Neale Donald Walsch has come through again!! For anyone new to his books, this might be a bit overwhelming, but to those of us who have been reading his books for years, this is just wonderful!! I am so thankful for the insights he has brought to the world, if only more people could read & understand! But I know - this is how it goes!"
5,What God Wants...A simple request.,"I highly recommend this book, but only for the open minded among us who still seek eternal truth, for they shall receive enlightenment from within. For those among us who are closed minded that believe that they already have all of the answers, they shall probably find this book not very interesting and quite challenging to keep up with."
5,Logical,"Read this book! Although some of the concepts presented here may seem radical at first, if you read this book with an open mind and give the ideas in this book a fair chance you may very well see the elegant simplicity, balance, and logic of the concepts presented here. Be sure to check out ""Conversations With God - Book One"" as well. Excellent!!"
