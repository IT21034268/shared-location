3,Old Humour,"If you really want to buy this book then dont. Buy her latest book, The Comedy Bible. Its basically an updated version of this one. I ended up buying 2 books because they both have different titles. I wasnt impressed. Why not just update this one. No she has to update it and give it a new title. Not very funny at all."
5,A Great Beginner's Book!,"I am just realizing that stand-up is something I might want to pursue, and this book really helped me out in making that decision. If you're interested in comedy, definitely get this book!"
1,save your money,You should wait until richard pryor writes a how to be funnybook; wait... he's dead. Save your money and stay in school.
1,"bad book ,bad classes","The book reads ok, but really doesn't portray current comedy styles. May have been good in the 80's, but not now. Her classes are not current either."
3,Interesting but superficial,"For those looking up for a technique, newsflash, there isn't.I felt reading a series of bullets points intercalated with some reviews and cases of old times comediants."
2,Needs variable woofer control,"I purchased this white unit after owning a black one. The black one, exact same same model number, has a woofer output control on the right speaker. This one lacks the control. You really need to be able to control woofer output, as some music hasn't enough, some has way too much, and the woofer rattles and clatters, and some, Goldilocks, is just right. But most is not just right, therefore, beware if you are expecting woofer control, there isn't any."
1,this is absolutely the worst book i have ever read!,"it sounded *so* interesting... it sounded like the type of book that i would buy, read, and enjoy... i'm 24 years old and i majored in english as an undergrad, so no matter what i read, the writing has to be *good* if nothing else... i'm not picky about the type of reading matter (literature, nonfiction, romance novels, shampoo bottles in the shower), but i cannot stand bad writing... i also cannot stand a character that is supposed to be sympathetic that is entirely *not*! the main character in this book downs more drugs and alcohol than is fit for human consumption. she whines her way through the entire book, has an obsessively unhealthy relationship with her father and then has a child who she breast feeds until he is over the age of *three* yuk! i'm supposed to identify with this woman?? i should hope that no one out there does... save your money for something else!"
1,Bore Me,Use Me represents the worst of an annoying trend in literature -- the glorification of self-obsessed characters. It is unadulaterated prententious drivel.
2,"boring, inauthentic and pretentious","I don't know what's worse, the author's photo of her pseudo goth, retro 1920s bob paired with that silly little nose ring and sullen expression or her pretentious opening about how her parents MADE her go to every museum in France when she was a child. I just couldn't read any more, it was torture."
5,I'm writing a review for the first time and I feel like...,"..a big dork, but its worth it to say that Use Me is lovely. Schappell is more concerned with telling the stories of Mary Beth and Evie than impressing literary critics... and I'm glad. Characters are fleshed out and the title story did such a good job of getting into the main characters head, it made me gasp. I'm desperate to read more by Schappell and have already lent my copy of Use Me out... but not before carefully writing my name and number on the inside cover."
2,Oh Please ... Too Over the Top!,"I was excited to hear that Elissa Schappell had a book out because I am a fan of her work in ""Vanity Fair."" Also, I like books that have short stories or vignettes that link together (i.e. Susan Vreeland's ""Girl In Hyacinth Blue"" or Melissa Banks' ""Girls Guide To Hunting & Fishing""). However, ""Use Me"" did not appeal to me. Much of the material felt contrived and gratuitous: the rebellion, the ""supposed to shock you"" sex, the multiple abortions, even the father's cancer -- I felt like a voyeur. Ick.It would be unfair not to mention that this is a well written book (the reason for the two star rating) -- but frankly the good writing is lost in this novel (perhaps because it is trying too hard to be hip and clever!?!). Ultimately, this was a draining read and I was tired of Evie's self-obsessive, self-serving, and overall petulant behavior. Save your pennies -- I am sure this one will be remaindered."
3,Use Me chapter saved this book,"I had this book on my Wish list for months and finally found it at the public library. I read it last week and was glad that it was a library read and not a purchase or gift. The book was mediocre at times and the stories varied in terms of the quality of the narration and writing.The ""Use Me"" short story was by far the most compelling piece in the collection. I was left breathless at the end of that story and I wished that the rest of the stories were as powerful."
2,good writer -- horrible characters,"elissa schappell can write -- she's got a deft turn of phrase, an ear for the poignant wisecrack. but this book -- agh! both of the female leads are nauseating people. especially evie, who is a whiny spoiled brat. (her sarcasm does not redeem her; she's awful.) you'd never want to know them, meet them, anything. they're the kind of women you avoid when you see them on the street. i really thought that this was going to be better than all of those Banks/Fielding-like books (AKA witty female narrators going through the typical NEW YORK magazine rites of passage, wittily), but i was WRONG. please, ms. schappell, write about different people! (and i hope that neither of them were based upon you.)"
2,BORING!,"The author is a very skilled writer. Her ability to visually describe a scene is excellent. Unfortunately she writes from the point of view of an obsessively self-centered, selfish, spoiled dislikeable brat. I finished the book, hoping I guess to see some epiphany or life change. The last chapter describing her nursing off her own breast, her horrid treatment of a very decent husband and her treatment of her best friend who listened to her for twenty years cry about her father made my stomach turn. Was this women supposed to evoke sympathy. A waste of time unless you want to read it so you'll feel good about yourself (which you will if you have ever done one productive or nice thing for someone else in your entire life)."
5,This documentary changed my perspective on life,"Alan Moore is one of the (if not THE) most celebrated and awarded writers in the comic book (or graphic novel) medium. This documentary film is an indepth look into the life, influences, thoughts and musings of Alan Moore. While I had a hard time understanding Mr. Moore's very thick accent (I watched it with subtitles on), it was by no means a distraction from the contents of the film, namely a journey into Moore's mind and his creative process. This film also has had a very strong impact in how I view life, creativity and the medium of literature and art. This film is a must see for anyone who cares about the creative process and our culture in general. Brilliant, poignant and very thought-provoking."
2,Only for fans of Moore,"I realize that to some people Alan Moore is a God. He is interesting for a bit, but no amount of intrusive music and staged Floyd-like film inserts could really cover up for the sheer pretentious gibberish that barrages the viewer of this documentary. The worst aspect of the endless torrent of laconic speaking ... is how quickly the more interesting and publicly consumable works like Watchmen, From Hell, and V for Vendetta are brushed past.Seriously, this is only for the true blue fan."
5,Great work on history and design of typefaces,"Although called ""Anatomy of a Typeface,"" this book actually takes about 20 classic typefaces and analyzes each, discussing its designer, history, and aesthetics in depth. This is an outstandingly thoughtful and well-researched book by a master in the field, potentially of use both to someone with a basic understanding of the topic and to an expert"
3,"Misleading title, but still an important book","I bought this because I was told it was one of the three best books for studying typography (the others being ""The Elements of Typographic Style"" and ""Letters of Credit""). Based on the title, I was hoping this would give me a better sense of the visual/technical vocabulary and structure of typefaces in general. Instead it is basically a history of the important type faces and designers, tracing the reasons why different styles moved in and out of fashion/use as printing technology and publishing in general progressed. I found it very dry, and less useful than the other two books, but I can see where any designer should have at least a passing understanding of the content of this book. I just think it should have a different title. ""Letters of Credit"" talks more about the ""anatomy"" of typefaces, so I might recommend starting there."
3,Not much to the book,"The book description says 207 pages, but only the first 72 pages are the actual book. The rest of the pages are just lyrics. As one reviewer said ""you can read this in one sitting"". True, but for $12.97 I guess you can't really complain."
4,Wonderful music,"As another reviewer has mentioned, the tempo is not always optimal for dancing. In addition, some of the tracks seem too short to get a set buzzing. That said, they're a super length for listening...the band is great, and the tune choices are excellent! For those Jane Austen adaptation fans who simply must have their own copy of 'Mr. Beveridge's Maggot,' look no further than this cd!"
3,"Good for listening, so-so for dancing.","I lead a local English Country dance group, and we use this CD quite a bit, but just for 3 or 4 of the songs. Some of the cuts are not at a good dancing tempo. For example, ""Gathering Peasecods"" is way too slow. OK for teaching I guess, but its hard to be light on your feet in slow motion."
3,CD doesn't play on older player,"The music and artist are very good, however I find it strange that the CD will play on the CD drive of both of our computers, and on the small CD player in our living room, but is not recognized as a CD by our old stereo on which all our other CDs play with no problem. Very odd."
3,Limited scope - for book authors mainly,"This book is thorough and detailed, but most of the suggestions are oriented toward book publishers and authors trying to get publicity. If you are a psychologist, attorney, software manufacturer, inventor, consultant, hardware store owner, pet sitter or car wash franchisee, you will not find this book as useful as others on the subject."
3,Not as broad based as hoped,"I got this book because I hear a lot of buzz from prospective clients about using PR to promote their business virtually free. I figured this book had something to do with it.What I found was a pretty good guide for using media exposure and publicity to promote yourself as and author or pundit--plus a great sales tool for the authors who are PR consultants--surprise!.Not as practical when you are thinking of trying to promote a business like metal stamping, accounting services or the like. Some nuggets are applicable.The dream this book whips up is that you can promote anything for only a few pennies and lots of good old American hard work and polite deference to journalists.PR is important but make sure you have a marketing plan working alongside your PR efforts... good luck!"
5,the definitive guide,"Anyone who claims to be a sales and/or marketing guru must have this book and read it. I consider it the definitive guide on the subject and for the price-to-number-of-pages margin (which I hold for guidebooks, not novels), comes up a winner.Really packs the punch."
5,"Guerrilla Publicity by Levinson, Frishman, and Lublin","This book is dynamite. I happened to have my copy of Guerrilla Publicity with me while waiting 3 hours in a medical clinic. I started reading and by the time I left, I had the publicity campaign for my business fully organized. This book is an easy read and right to the point. I hate to think how much time and money I would have spent if I had not discovered Guerrilla Marketing. I was so impressed that I bought a second copy just in case I wore my first one out. It is definitely a ""must have"" for anyone interested in planning a publicity campaign."
3,research material,"This book was helpful in my research for a school assignment on P.R., but most of my classmates found Michael Levine's ""Guerrilla PR"" more informative overall. It was definitely worth taking a look at, though."
2,guerilla marketing is for monkeys,"While the book does have some kitchy / catchy ideas, overall, as someone in business/in new york, I found that it was chock a block full of campaigns that any busy person would just not have the time to do.In a pedestrian manner methodologies for establishing oneself as an expert were outlined and followed with plenty of ways of getting oneself on must(not)seeteevee.<BR"
2,VERY Noisy during use ...,"This transformer can cause big noises during use. I ordered this product to power a 1000 Watt appliance which requires 220 Volts. During each use, for at least 2 to 3 times, the transformer needs to generate big noise to power up the 220V appliance. Very disappointing!"
1,Awfull,Doesn't work correctly.This power adaptor is useless. It's not able to transfer 1000W.I think buying this item is like a bed. You may find the good one with a very low probability.
1,Terrible Machine,Burnt off after exactly 4 times and I am thinking to trash it. I had to change the house electric fuse the first time I used the machine. Not sure if I can recommend this to you.
2,great but the smell,Works great if you can get past the smell after about 15 to 20 minutes of use. Not sure if anyone else has this issue. Cant use it the smell gets worse as it stays on longer. I noticed the same smell when I opened the box. I have it pwering a portable AC unit I purchased in Germany. Even when I have the unit on with nothing plugged in you can still smell it.
2,good and bad.,"the item is good, but the packaging was not good at all, the item been dropped during the shipping and there was a huge dent at the bottom of the item, and it was not even leveled on the table, i plug it in and it still work, and my dad fix the dent with hammer, and i didn't bother to send it back for a new one. so please , pack it well next time when someone orders."
5,Heavy Duty,Got to me within only days and I am overseas in Europe. Works Great. I recommend buying this product if you are in need of a transformer.
2,Loud Noise Generated When Using This Transformer,"I bought this unit to run a 110V laser printer in a 22O country. Every time the printer runs, the transformer makes a loud grumbling noise. The system also gets very hot. It's a 3000 watt system for a 1000 watt appliance, so there's no chance that I'm straining the capacity. Oh well..."
2,"Not to say it doesn't work, but didn't work for me",I have a 125 gallon saltwater reef tank and used this product actually took 2 bottles to complete treatment and ICH never went away. I had heard a lot of great reviews on this product so I still believe in it but I can't rate 5 stars as it was not affective in ridding the ICH in my tank. I will say that on a positive side it did not affect my corals at all.
1,Worthless Hippie Herb Remedy,"I've been taking care of fish for about two decades with a 240 gallon tinfoil barb tank and 94 gallon goldfish tank. This is Kordon's worst product! I bought it after getting infected fish. It doesn't work and is just a bunch of hippie herbs. In fact one of my 10 year old goldfish died from ich from the failure of this product! I had a 5 micron filter, UV light filter, and many water changes with healthy bacteria and my fish still died! It only irritates the fish and doesn't get rid of ich. If you want to get rid of ich get Kordon's Rid Ich +. It has malachite green with some other natural products that kills those evil parasites in a couple days."
2,Stupidity in shipping,"This ladle was inexpensive. The shipping cost was more than its cost. However, no care was used in packing it. It was placed in a box with no protection as in just a simple plastic bag or bit of tissue paper. It bounced around during shipping and ended up scratched and scuffed. So much for its looking all right as a gift.It is hard to find what I would describe as good help now but just a minor amount of management guidence would have prevented this. A small purchase but an example of how this vendor for Amazon could have worked smarter."
4,What Can I Say,"The book arrived in the condition promised in a timely fashion. I didn't find the book as useful as I had hoped, but that's not the shipper's fault. I have no reservations about ordering from them again, and definitely recommend them."
3,WATCH OUT PARENTS!,"I bought this for my 5yr old daughter last year for Christmas. It was a big hit with grown-ups and kids alike and she still plays with occasionally, the problem I have with him is that he is light activated and whenever a shadow moves over him he talks, it is enough to drive a grown-up crazy. If you buy this for your child, beware-he will drive you crazy."
5,Fun with Scooby,"My son (6) received this for his birthday...and he loved it. The batteries died pretty quickly, but it is an adorable Scooby. I recommend it for a Scoobie affecionado in your family!"
5,Optimus Prime is BEASTLY!,"This toy is extremely fun to transform and looks great in both modes. He also fits better in scale with figures such as Rattrap and Cheetor. He is a recolor of the 10th anniversary Optimus Primal and I think the colors fit better with his 'monkey' mode. Having a great mold and colors, his only draw back is the loose legs and extremely tight arm joints - and in robot mode he can't ride on his surf board!Other than that, this is a great toy and definitely a much less expensive(and better) alternative than the original Optimus Primal."
1,Waste of $25,"The instructions are incredibly unhelpful, it's supposed to be able to clip onto a board that it can't clip on to, and it's transformation is more crappy and badly conceived than President Bush's policies. Do not buy it. The only good thing about this toy is its durability."
4,Before there was a Carnac,"This book was around our house when we were growing up. It was Steve Allen's devise--to provide clever Questions to well-known phrases or expressions as the Answers--a precursor to Johnny Carson's ""Carnac"". Very funny, sometimes silly, and delightfully outdated in some cases, as inAnswer: ""They come in a crush-proof box.""Question: Why are my cigarettes crushed, but not the box?Entertaining! Share it with friends who have a love of the history of American comedy."
2,Yawn,"Boring...You'll get more information just cruising around on the internet. It's required reading for some Berkley course. You would be better off finding someone in the business and work as their driver or something. I did that with the Doors attorney, and that was educational. He said, ""Working with dead artists is the way to go--less issues.""There...now become rich in the music industry."
5,Great Reading!!!,Just graduated college and trying to break into the music industry and fell across this book which has provided me with a wealth of information on how to successfully cohabitate in this often times frustrating but rewarding profession.
3,"six of one, a half dozen of the other","I ordered this one while on one of my demonology trips gathering all types of information to prepare myself for war against Satan. Curses and demons around every corner. Fortunately, the book contains a good amount of scripture. A bit too sensational now that I sit down to review it. Begins with the premise that curses are real and follows by describing different types that exist (generational, personal sin, accursed objects, witchcraft, etc.) He then goes on to describe eight laws that govern each category of curse. He concludes with a four page chapter dedicated to steps in breaking curses. Writing style identical to ""Pigs in the Parlour."""
2,"Silly, but entertaining.","Have you ever been cursed? You know, the usual: You're walking down the street minding your own business when, suddenly, you smell brimstone. The cement below your feet starts to heat up, and then the vague outline of a lesser demon appears. I hate it when that happens. So you whip out your trusty St. Vitus' charm, a ragged copy of the Good News, and a long, pointed stick and prepare to do battle with the forces of evil.Above all else, this book will make you feel a lot better about yourself, knowing that there are so many much sillier people out there who might actually believe this hokum. But it is also scary, in that they might be your neighbors."
5,great,"It was just what we wanted and they worked plus cheap price.I would order them again for the price, can not bet!"
2,Disapointing,"This book is a follow up to ""Jenny"" and for me was a disapointment. The character build-up in the story is too shallow and there are too many similarities to the ""Jenny"" story. Needed a more interesting and unique story-line to hold interest."
1,I was expecting oi!,"When I purchased this album, I had been a Buisness fan for a while. I was also expecting oi, but instead what I got was 80's pop and synthesizers. Don't make the mistake I did, do not purchase this! If you want some good Buisness buy ""The truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth"". This in my opinion is one of their best albums."
5,Great Deal,Great product and price. I have used them for six months and I am very satisfied! I have a saltwater set up and rinse mine once a week and replace once a month. These work great.
5,Very good filter,"A quality filter and priced very fair, these can be rinsed out a few times extending there use, the shipping is fast, and there made in the US, lets buy American, i use these filters in all my tanks and have been very pleased with the way they help keep my tanks very clean, i give these a 5***** thumbs up, a very good filter"
5,"Great filters, and lowest price around!","I have 4 Penguin Bio-wheels running on 3 tanks, so I figured that I'd save a bit of extra cash by using walmart brand aqua-clear filters on the Penguins; since they look identical. Boy, was that a mistake. They may look the same, but in the Penguin filters they use ""black diamond"" activated carbon, which is worlds different from aqua-clear. You can really tell by the water quality.I will purchase these all the time now, as it's the best price around!"
2,Short life span,"When you first put them in the tank, they work fine. But very quickly they clog up internally, no matter how many times you rinse them off in the sink. They are overly expensive for the short usage you can get out of them. Why isn't someone makikng a less expensive version of these?"
5,excellent,I needed to change my filter cartridges but they were a little pricey and I could only find them in a bag of three. This box has many more and at an excellent price.
5,6-Pack of Marineland Penguin Size C Cartridges,"Perfect! The name-brand cartridges for my aquarium filter, and at just about 50% discount! I will re-order again and again!!"
5,"quiet, powerful with goos price","I have two of those and they have been working very good. Motor is quiet and powerful, filter cartridge is easy to clean and not too expensive to replace. bettter than Aqueon filter which i bought before!"
4,Rite-Size at the RIGHT PRICE,The filters do what they are supposed to do BUT they do clog up pretty quick. Our local fish store said to change them every couple of weeks. I use the sink sprayer to clean the stuff off the filter and just reinsert them. I do this only a few times. The charcoal loses it's effectiveness after awhile.
4,Clean Water!,"Marineland makes awesome products, period. The only reason I give it four and not five stars, is that they manufacture the same filters for Wal*Mart, under a different name, and they cost less."
4,"Terrific Deal! Excellent FIlters, But...","The deal for 6 filters is great, but I wish they lasted longer than 3 weeks. Now, this could be because our resident fishies continue to procreate and have fry after fry....so many that, if they continue to have offspring, we will have to take them to a pet store to be adopted. That being said, the filters DO WORK, but they seem to need replacing very soon after installing a fresh one, but as I mentioned, it could be because we have a lot of fish, and they are overloading the tank. FYI: we have small fish (platies, tetras, and sailfin mollies) in a 27 gallon, square tank. There are about 12 fish in the tank."
3,Carbon exposed to the air..,These may or may not be a good deal.My understanding is that carbon cannot be exposed to air sinceit will absorb impurities.The packs of filters I've bought in the past were all encased in plastic wrap.These all came unwrapped and loose in an unwrapped non-airtight thin cardboard box.So I am wondering if the carbon has been compromised by the packaging.I don't think I'll buy them again this way.
3,"Works well, but does not rinse well. Somewhat wasteful.","These work well, but they do not rinse well and I feel wasteful having to throw them out every 2 weeks. I have switched to a generic brand that is more biodegradable."
4,Cerilli pumps the red biscuit,How bout the cerilli. He sounds like a brand of pasta but he plays the blues like fess' and the doc. what a hero to the community. Ive nae heard a better playa of that type stuff. That one goes out to all the boyz yeah yeah one tyme. Yi Yi Yi.
2,This book does not capture the reader at all!,"I love to read books about real-life EMT's. This book was more like a history lesson on the Emergency Medical System. Boring! I don't want the hisoriography of the entire profession, any textbook can give me that! I want a close-up look at the lives of the men and women who work in the field. This book was fairly tedious and predictable. Nothing like some of the more exciting EMS books on the market. Be sure and read ""Emergency!"" which is much more interesting than ""Into the Breach."""
2,"A good representation of University EMS, some off views too","I bought ""Into the Breach"" on the recommendation of a co-worker who used to work at ""The U"". I enjoyed it as a ""homer"", but think that Karam could have done a lot more with the story to make it more appealing to those not familiar with the environment. There seemed to be a lot of loose ends, a lot of adjectives/adverbs used over an over again. Also, Karam paints a very negative picture of Emergency Nurses. I don't know if this is the result of a year of brainwashing by the blueshirts, that ""skirts"" are lazy, or don't understand, or what. But the author seems to go out of her way in several circumstances to make nurses seem uncaring, rude, and ignorant. If this is how ED Nurses in the Newark area act, then they should be ashamed of themselves, especially with the reputation that the EDs/Trauma Center in Newark have."
4,"A reader from Owingsville, KY","Generally, this is an ideal field book for the identification of plants. The descriptions are very informative and complete. The book does have one drawback. The index contains many errors."
2,Disenchantment,"I fell in love with And One in 1992 and they were so funny then! All their albums beginning with with Flop are interesting and well done musically, even Virgin Superstar is a nice example of ironic techno pop, but this ""warming up"" single is a piece of you-know-what. It doesn't touch me at all. Unfortunately, something wrong happened to And One."
5,The Rosetan Italians,"I am from Roseto PA, and also have ancestors who have come over from Roseto Itay. For me it was really enjoyable especially since my family was mentioned in the book and are well known in the community. I found the book extremely intersting and very true as to how the Rosetans in PA once lived, although as Carla mentioned, Roseto PA is now very Americanized. The stories and folklore are very similar to what I heard from my relatives growing up. I highly reccomend the book to anyone interested in learning more about the Italian way of life."
1,"It is NOT .270, it's .270WSM not even close","I bought this a couple weeks ago and was extremely dissapointed, it's advertised as .270 Winchester but it came as 270 Winchester Short Mag, clear as a bell marked on the package when it arrived. The two cartridges are not even remotely close in chambering. When I tried to return it I had 24 hrs by postmark for it to be accepted from time of complaint. I recieved it on Saturday afternoon and obviously the Post Office is closed on Sunday which voided my return. I believe this was outsourced thru another company and not an Amazon in stock item from their warehouse. It came from Source Media Group and they are either BLIND or STUPID, probably both! I reccomend not buying anything thru this company. My only recourse is to sell it on the Bay now, pitiful experience to say the least!!!"
1,horrible,"i bought this item expecting a .270 win and received a ""universal"" marked 30-06, 25-06, 270 win. obviously three different chambers. it did not even go into the .270 chamber and the bolt will not close on the 30-06. have not had luck contacting shipping co. yet. i only gave one star because i could not leave zero stars."
4,"Midsomer Murders, Set 10","Upon receiving this product which did arrive quickly and was quit cheap in comparision to prices in Australia I was quite annoyed to find out that this actual DVD was not Season 10 as I had believed but Season 8, Part 2.I'm not sure if they are released differently in the USA but in Australia this DVD set is DEFINATELY not Season 10.Thankfully I didn't have Season 8, Part 2 so it didn't make too much of a difference."
3,not the best of them,l love these but of l have seen this is really not the best way to any names to keep up with. have really watch them over again for it to make sense. but its still great to be there seeing all those lovely places and trying to figure who done it.
4,One flawed selection,"I'm a great fan of this series and own almost all of the DVDs. But set 10 contains one of the worst clunkers I've ever suffered through: Second Sight. We are asked to believe that an Anglican minister committed three murders in order to baptize a single child, thereby sending a message to the local bishop that the clergyman was effective as an evangelist!! Look for the ""menacing"" shots of a font and a prayer book; such evil.I'm used to seeing Anglican and Catholic clergy being attacked by the British (see, for example, ""A Near Death Experience"" in A Touch of Frost, year 12); England is a secular and materialistic culture. But this is going way way over the edge into gaga land. It's a serious flaw in an otherwise entertaining and consistently well made series."
5,Great Detective Series,"My wife, mother, and I followed these when they aired on a couple cable networks. We were all sorely disappointed when they did not continue to air them. I had already bought several sets on DVD for my mother when they ceased televising them. I am just very happy they are putting all the sets on DVD. I just ordered sets 9 and 10 for my mom's birthday. I do wish they put them in seasons rather than sets, because you end up buying sets that you aren't sure what season they were. All the sets are available in the UK, but haven't been released as Region 1 in the US. If you enjoy detective series, this is one of the best out there. I am a fan of police shows, and the change to the British countryside and culture has a nice feel to it. The stories, acting, directing, sets, and scenery are great. Each set contains four mysteries. I highly recommend this series. The DVD quality is first class and they have excellent replayability. The set is the slim case type. - C. Luster"
5,"Midsomer Murders, Set 10",We were so disappointed when BBCA stopped showing the Midsomer Murders that we decided to collect them all - slowly. These are so well done and without commercial breaks are even better to watch.
5,Midsomer Murders,"I absolutely love English mystery stories and Midsomer Murders just happens to be one of my favorites. I like the characters, the stories and getting to see the English countryside in these DVD's."
5,THE ONLY VIDEODISK WE BUY,One of the very few TV series that still is consistently good. This long-running series is the only video disks that we are buying these days. Netflix for the rest.
4,A great read on the process and stages of recovery,"This was very easy to read, and I really liked the question and answer format. As an Adult Child just starting on the road to recovery, I got the most benefit from the first four chapters. I also liked seeing the stages ahead, especially the common pitfalls, and will definitely refer back to this book as I progress. But I felt this book was more ABOUT recovery, not a guide on HOW to recover. For me, this book helped me understand so many things, but I feel I have to go elsewhere for concrete actions to take. (I'm trying an inner child workbook next.) Definitely a good starting point."
4,A very good start,The ideal book if you are beginning your journey of recovery due to alcoholics. It give many answers to initial questions. It does not give any lasting answers to the great mysteries of life but that is not its purpose anyway. So...a good start
5,This book was a game-changer for me.,I read this book when I was in my early 20's. I bought this one for my son-in-law. I hope God uses it to help him as much as it helped me.
2,NOT good!!!,"They have an old naked lady who's supposed to be a sex therapist with the couples and the only way I can describe it is... creepy. She has this robotic voice and the whole thing is just odd, NOT sexy."
3,bit-shooter screwdriver,"Excellent idea-in-design...but poor in quality-of-construction (yellow plastic handle cap that retains extra ""bit"" cartridges shattered to pieces the first time screwdriver was dropped..brittle as an egg shell and no replacement part available). Otherwise, just pull the bit-cartridge/chamber upwards...rotate chamber to select the proper screwdriver bit...then pull chamber back to handle and the proper bit is in place for use (what could be easier?!) Just !BE GENTLE! with the product!!!"
5,Catchy Sketchy #2,"One of my favourite anime types that I seek out is comedy based off of Japanese 4 panel comic artwork (yonkoma); Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, K-On!, GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class, et cetera. I like the jumpy randomness, the nonchronological stories... especially for repeat watching. You're not following over-ly complex story arcs. Although all of these shows tend to take you through the three years of high school, this series is extra special that the story is completely out of sequence based on months. I enjoy piecing the story together or my brain doing it for me.The characters are quite appealing, especially the spazz Miyako; I hope Sentai eventually releases the 3rd season."
5,Awesome,"I LOVE Hidamari Sketch with all my heart especially since its one of my favorite genre of anime which is ""Slice of Life"" slice of life is more like an anime you have to pay attention to because it has a really interesting plot/story If you think thats what your into then this anime seires is for you"
5,peace of mind,I bought this to use with back up sump. It works perfectly and appears to be very heavy duty. I called cust. support for wiring question which was answered right away.
5,Great!,"This is a great movie! Very entertaining and by the end of the movie, you feel like you know Bill. We loved it."
4,ESPERANZA Y FE,"SI HAZ PERDIDO A UN SER QUERIDO, ESTE LIBRO TE DARA ESPERANZA Y FE, SABRAS COMO ES EL LUGAR DONDE TU SER QUERIDO HA IDO, SU ALMA VIVE, Y VIVIRAS UNA VIDA COMPLETA SABIENDO QUE HABRA UN REENCUENTRO, QUE VOLVERAS A VER A LOS SERES QUE ALLAS PERDIDO, QUE SU ESPIRITU Y ALMA VIVEN, QUE EN REALIDAD NO HAN MUERTO. Y TE HARAN PREPARARTE PARA TU PROPIO FUTURO. YO LE REGALE ESTE LIBRO A UN FAMILIAR MIO, PARA QUE SEPA COMO ES EL LUGAR DONDE ESTA SU HIJA QUE MURIO EN UN TERRIBLE ACCIDENTE DE CARRO."
5,Just what I wanted,"I am eager to read this book in more depth. So far, I have just skimmed it. I am very interested in the Desert Fathers."
2,Global Treasures: Chavin de Huantar,The whole Global Treasures series is a fraud - 10 minutes of the most superficial coverage. This video of Chavin de Huantar barely shows you the archaeological site and a few pieces of the stone carvings. What an insult to this magnificent place!!!!!
3,O velho irreverente Chacrinha Barbosa,"Chacrinha era o pai da TV, pode se dizer assim dele.Encontrava-se dentro do palco como se estivesse em sua própria casa.Original, acabou criando coisas que ainda perduram na TV, e por ali muito tempo ainda vo ficar, mesmo até os tempos em que ninguém da geraco dele esteja mais aí e ninguém saberá dizer como existe estas coisas. Sem dúvida uma grande perda para a TV brasileira,e nunca mais será substituído."
1,Jennifer Dietrich's review of The Edge of Heaven,"The Edge of Heaven by Marita Golden was boring, slow, uninteresting, unexciting, and is for people who like to read about family problems. This book had no plot, and no attention grabber. It was very hard to get into. Other readers may enjoy the book. ""Come on Teresa. Are you sick?"" ""No, I'm fine."" BORING! ""Do you want me to fix you a plate, Teresa?"" Not very exciting! ""I'll be glad to meet him. Or would that be too much to ask?"" Prime example of family problems. This author, surley was not directing this kind of book to teenagers. It would be more for adults ages ranging from 25 and older. Being a teenager, it was not a very interesting book to read. Good Luck to anyone else who reads this book. But just as it was said before,this book was boring, slow, uninteresting, unexciting, and is for people who like reading about family problems.It had no plot or attention grabber. Marita, try writing something for a younger crowd!"
5,every home should have one,"hey everyone,i' am a young music listener from gent, Belgium& me and my brother like your music very much, Mahabubwe would very much like to hear more"
4,A Bargain of Short Fiction at Any Price,"First off, you should know that I am a writer myself (""The Legacy"" (ISBN 0972005021), a historical mystery; ""Ordinary Lives"" (ISBN 09720050050, a collection of short fiction; ""River Stories"" (ISBN 0972005013), a collection of essays; and ""Pigs, A Trial Lawyer's Story"" (ISBN 097200503X). I feel it's important for other readers to know where a review is coming from. Having made that disclosure, I will also disclose that I had no idea who Cary Fagan was until I walked into the Coles Bookstore in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and picked up a copy of ""The Doctor's House"" from the discount bin. .... The stories, nearly all novellas in length, are quality fiction, with well crafted plots and subtle shifts in character that are the mark of a great writer. Only one story, ""The Village Angel"" was less than stellar. I found the ending flat. But given the quality of the other pieces, I'm willing to overlook a mild disappointment or two. All in all, a wonderful collection."
3,Interesting but disjointed,"This book originated as a series of lectures that were given at various times over a period of years, which probably explains why I came away feeling that I had been provided with lots of interesting anecdotes, but very little analysis, very few connections, and no attempt whatsoever to be thorough. There is a good bit of interesting information here about Burmese alchemy and magic, the ritual of the nine gods, initiation rites, and the stories of the nats (powerful Burmese ancestor spirit). U Htin Aung is a native, obviously well informed and has some interesting thoughts about the origins of the practices he describes. But at the end I felt like I had a few random observations, and very little else."
1,Very very disappointing,Don't be fooled by positive reviews or publisher summaries. This book is a waste of money. For my money there wasn't a single useful thing in this book. Just vague generalized descriptions that any serious practitioner magick will likely already know. There are no helpful tools for practical defense and the information provided is so short and sweet it won't give you any insights toward figuring out a defense for yourself. Save your money and buy a better book.
2,Disappointing,"The book is written like a childs book; small paragraphs with little information, most (and more) of which can be found on the internet for free. I was expecting practical guidance, how to, not general (very general) information about different beliefs and magical practices, or parasitic infestation. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it listed info on angels, fairies and other levels of entities as a reference and it had some recipes, if you look hard. Other than that, you can find all on the internet, including that about the angels, fairies etc. If you are looking for a ""how to protect against"" then look elsewhere. This book approachs the subject in such an innocent fashion that it is actually laughable."
1,Don't buy this book,"If you want a book regarding how to pick your breed with hardly anything specific to the American Eskimo breed, buy this book. Otherwise, pass it by. After a brief history of the American Eskimo, the rest of the book referred to generic your breed. I found it a total waste of time.I purchased: American Eskimo Dogs : Everything About Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Breeding, Behavior, and Training (A Complete Pet Owner's Manual) by D. Caroline Coile which was much more informative."
2,Great research by Wardlow marred by Calt's poor presentation,"This book is fairly essential to those interested in themusic of Patton and his contemporaries, as it is based onthe comprehensive research on the subject by Gayle DeanWardlow, research which is largely unavailable elsewhere.Unfortunately, Calt's presentation of this information ispoor at best, and downright malicious at times. His writing istypically peppered with ad homien attacks at his subjects,and this book is no exception. The book is also in desperateneed of thorough editing... one sometimes wonders how it got publishedat all."
5,The ultimate portrait of the quintessential delta bluesman.,"This book is the final word in the elusive character known as Charley Patton. Gayle Dean Wardlow's exhaustive research and Steven Calt's vivid presentation create a text which I have read and re-read dozens of times. Unlike biased hacks such as David Evans , the two authors give a balanced , even handed portrait of ""Papa Charley"" , the greatest blues artist the Mississippi delta has ever produced....and that's saying something."
3,Handles are too short,I bought this to replace two large plastic scoops used to dole out dog food that we have had for years. The scoops seem well made and probably work very well for smaller ice containers etc. Using them for dry goods you immediately notice how short the handles are against the overall size of the scoop. I wear a men's large work glove and the handle only extends to about 2/3 of my palm when holding the scoops. This unfortunately diminishes the leverage you have when mixing or scooping heavier dry goods. If the handles were two or three inches longer the scoops would be great.
2,Handle TOO Short,"This would be a great product, but for one thing -- The handle is TOO SHORT. I don't have big hands, but this handle is about 1/2"" to 3/4"" too short. I can't get a good grip on it unless I ""choke up"" on it and stick my thumb in the scoop. To me, this is just a bad design flaw. Maybe they have smaller hands in the Orient. Otherwise, the scoop is well made. The sticker is very difficult to remove, but ""doable."""
3,Nice CD - but some drawbacks,"I like this CD - but it has both strong and weak points. The strong point is the excellent U.S. Army Chorus - their all male voicing is perfect for this kind of repertoire. The weak point of this disc is the limited repertoire and the inconsistency of the quality throughout the disc. My understanding is that these Allegro recordings are essentially legal pirates of music which the military itself is not permitted to sell to the public. Through a quirk in the law - Allegro gathers whatever free recordings it can find of the military ensembles and repackages them for sale to the public. The result is a rather paltry selection of music of varying quality (since the recordings contained on this disc were not intended for commercial release on a CD). After listening to this disc I am convinced that the best choral recording of the entire patriotic repertoire is the newly released ""Spirit of Freedom"" by the Washington Men's Camerata (on the Gothic label)."
3,"Great Band, Mediocre Music","The music found on this CD represents a problem found with many of the US service bands today. These premiere bands of world class quality too often restrict themslves playing patriotic dribble! Instead of sticking to marches, and other standard band fare they too often perform pretencious music with embarrassing patriotic overtones. One can be patriotic without having it hammered over your head like a lot of this music does. Also, the selections are odd because the music on this CD was not intended for commercial use in this way. The US Army Band in common with all US service bands produces free recordings for public use. What has been packaged here for sale is not a good example of that. Hence the different sound qaulity on some of the tracks, as well as the overall short duration of the CD. Less than 50 minutes total."
5,"Good info, eye opening",This documentary is basicly a combination of the two previous films Demographic Winter and Demographic Bomb. Still well worth the time and money in my opinion. The information contained in this film will help you better understand the forces behind our economy. If you have young children this is must have information for their economic futures.
4,"A page turner, but not necessarily great literature","I think the words ""soap opera"" best describe this book. It's full of romance, back-stabbing, infidelity, drama, etc, which make for a page turner, but I would say that this book is more of a girly vegging-out indulgence than great literature. It all depends on what you're looking to read - if you want to simply relax without thinking too hard, you'll love this book. If you're looking for insightful prose, you may want to try elsewhere."
2,A Waste of Time,"This is an over written book in which many phrases are repeated over and over again as a substitute for bringing a character to life in the reader's mind. Description is minimal and plot development is more soap opera than literature. Clarissa is the most arresting character and the one that should have been central to the novel. Her movement from society girl to head of a corporation would be far more interesting, and more in the realm of romance of a woman discovering her multiple gifts.The copywright date for this book is 1995, and now in 2010 it is published here in the states. It appears that the author's ""better"" books made to this shore first and now the second rate ones are following."
1,Forbidden Places,I bought two copies of Forbidden Places -one for me and the other for a friend - with minutes of opening the book I realized that I had already read the book and that it is being offered as a new book when actually it isn't-my friend had the same experience-I really will think before I order books from Amazon again-perhaps it is better to go to the local bookstore and read a little of the book and not make this mistake agin.
4,A Guilty Pleasure,"I don't know why Penny Vincenzi isn't a better known writer here in the US. Her books are filled with interesting characters and situations.This book, set in WWII England, is about 3 women and their marriages and relationships. Naive Grace marries above herself, Florence marries a bully, and Clarissa is married to a fighter pilot who is seriously hurt in combat. Their conflicts and choices are detailed and interesting and it makes for a great read!"
5,Romatic Suspence,"Just like all of Penny Vencenzi""s books this didn't disappoint. I loved it.She has the history of England,love, sex, suspence,betrayal, and keeps you reading for hours (when you should be doing something else).It was wonderful and I did not want it to end. Now thats a great book!!"
4,Greate VALUE,"While this is not the highest quality product in comparison with other brands, it certainly is best best value for the dollar."
1,"questionable quality, but works well","Questionable quality. I've had the gun just over a month and found it easy to use, lightweight, nice balance. I was fairly impressed. Then it just quit working, I'm guessing a seal ruptured somewhere inside b/c it just leaks instead of firing.If I could get hold of someone at customer service I would find out what is wrong for sure, but they don't answer the phone, even during their limited office hours, and seemingly don't respond to their email. I'm sure it's still under warranty, but probably won't be by the time I finally get hold of someone.UPDATE:The leak was apparently the result of a seal getting dry on the shelf and coming unseated. It was a quick DIY fix. Since then, I've been using it regularly without any problems or complaints. I'd change the rating to a 4* if I could."
5,Great for the money,I bought this at the local hardware megastore. I have been very pleased with this product. It works when i need it. Now if i could only find 3/8 staples:(
5,Real World Spirituality At Last!,"Thank God, a ""spiritual"" book that deals with the real, that doesn't claim to have all the answers or even any of them...one that shows you that you are already on the perfect path, and it's called ""life."" For all you Advaitins and meditators, this is nonduality at its best...embracing all that is with edgy humor and an emphasis on finding your own truth. The Chicks are in step with today's ""mystics"" who tell it like it is (Byron Katie, Steven Harrison, Jed McKenna, Ram Dass, etc.). Don't miss this."
5,Buy This Book Now!,Do yourself a favor and read this wonderful book now. The Spiritual Chicks will knock your spiritual socks off. You will find yourself questioning your own answers and answering your own questions. The book is a real treat.
3,Batteries are terrible,"Works great to sight in, I have a buddy go down range and put his finger on the dot and sight the scope in from there. The issue is with the batteries, you have maybe 15 minutes then they are junk. I replaced them several times already. After they sit for a few you get another few minutes then the laser dies again. My suggestion is to understand your time is very limited, so move quick once you turn it on!!"
3,meh - not great,"It's ok, but not worth the money. Eats batteries like M&Ms.; Basically - I zeroed the rifle the old way and my cats have a new toy to play with.Also the cartridge constantly got stuck in the chamber. I had to use my cleaning rod to pop it back out. I might cut it apart so I can hook up a real battery and grind it down so it doesnt stick."
1,Bore site misses mark,This producted retailed for just under $40.00 but was of a quality you'd expect for something that would retail for $1.00. The contact spring was not anchored allowing it to shift around inside the casing when the battery was installed. This prevented the unit from working properly if at all. I'd recommend spending a little more money on a higher quality product.
4,As good as the movie but Vinge isn't L. Frank Baum,"If you liked the movie by Walt Disney pictures than chances are you'll like this book. The story is riveting, and the characters are interesting--but this is not necessarily a story for kids. L. Frank Baum peopled his books with wizards, witches, scarecrows, tin-men and lions as well as a myriad of other strange and wonderous creatures. This novel gives us the Wheelers as well as some other odd characters which younger readers may find frightening. Certainly darker than L. Frank Baum's classic stories, this is nontheless a good book--well written and interesting."
2,Misleading,"By looking at the advertisement I was under the impression that I was getting a. 1 pound jar of each media. When it came its all the red stuff, now I have to purchase.corn media and brass polish to clean off the red left behind from this stuff ."
2,Buyer Beware...,"Good product, but appears to be a combo pack of all three types totaling the three pounds. Can be bought cheaper if you just want a single three pound bottle of one type."
4,Got what I paid for,"Extremely quick delivery. I got the regular Super Saver shipping and received my package the very next day. It did not come in a plastic container as the picture shows, instead inside a box it was a plastic baggie with the media. Walnut media works well for me and my brass."
5,High Qualty,"May not be the cheapest, but it is very high quality product, and will last for years. I have repeatedly washed and dried and re-used the walnut media."
1,cheap stuff,this media dyed my metal red so it was wasted money. I do not understand why there is no quality control
2,Not as pictured. :-(,"Read carefully. The picture shows three pounds, three types of media. It even shows convenient nifty recloseable screw top plastic containers.You get one pound of walnut media in a nondescript cardboard box. Granted, I may not have read carefully, and can't blame anyone but myself, but that won't stop me from not ordering anything from these people who can't even be bothered to be honest enough place an accurate picture on their ad ever again. Plbrfffffft! to you!!"
3,Tufnut is ok but corncob is better...,"My only complaint is it leaves alot of residue in the casing , it doesn't seem to hurt anything but just looks messy. Lyman has the corncob media which I prefer and does a great job."
1,Rip off,You can buy media cheaper and get more from your local store. Also the pic isn't true you only get one type of media in a small box
5,This is the best of the lads from Macc!,"I have been a major Macc Lads fan for years now. I have every CD they ever put out, even the ones no longer in print. This one is above all my favorite. This is the best of the lads from Macc! I've played it so much it broke. And I'm most definately getting it again! Eh up!"
1,"poor performance, I tossed it.","This kitchenaid chopper left big chunks unchopped. This was such poor performance, I tossed it. I had purchased something similar last year (I think through one of those late night TV come-ons) that worked fine and wore out. This one ended up in the trash."
2,"Jams easily, plastic flakes off, hard to assemble.","Really disappointed in this. Short and sweet:Pros:Chops well, when it works.Cons:-Easily jams. Push handle gets stuck down and the part that rotates gets jammed easily.-The plastic blade cover is too thin, the blades easily cut pieces of it off.-Reassembly after washing is annoyingly difficult. The part that covers the blades must be seated perfectly lest you cut the plastic.-Also it damages cutting boards but that's probably mostly from trying to unjam it :)"
2,Not as good as I thought,The chopper is hard to put together and have cut myself twice already. Trying to find a better product. I will think twice before buying a kitchenaid chopper.
2,Hard to clean,This looks cool on TV but you can do a better job of chopping with a knife. Mincing is out of the question.The blade is very sharp and extreme care must be taken when you disassemble this thing to clean it and it is hard to reassemble after cleaning.Buy a good chef's knife instead it will do a better job and is way more versatile.
2,"Doesn't chop evenly, impossible to clean, hard to reassemble","I've been looking for ages for a replacement for my crank-style nut grinder, without any luck. Decided to give in and try this style. Mistake! The nuts don't grind evenly. They all stay in the chamber during chopping, whereas the crank style drops them through a grate once they're ground small enough. With this one I end up with some big pieces that never got chopped, a bunch of pieces of various sizes, plus a lot of useless ""nut powder"". That doesn't make for a good baklava (or anything else, really).To make matters worse, the ""wave""-shaped blade is impossible to clean, even in the dishwasher, and trying to reassemble it afterward is like doing a puzzle. Just threw it in the trash. Hope you have better luck!"
2,Difficult to use,This product works but for the time you are going to spend just buy you a good set of knives. Its chops hard thing much better than soft things.
1,i hate it,"i hate it ,,, i don't like it. it is not as described.my experience about this item is not good. don't buy it"
1,I meen dis cud be good butt...,"it take a long time to learn how to uz. i dont know maybe im dum or soething, but i liked uzing my nifes better. thanks."
1,Broke after only a few uses...,My wife could not figure out how to use this on her own. Once if figured it out and we got the blades to rotate it worked once or twice and then broke. since then we have managed to use it but it still doesn't do the job we want. Finally on the 5th or 6th time the top push handle completely broke. I wish I could find the one my dad has as it has lasted them years and works great. This was a complete waste of money.
2,Waste of space in my cupboard,"Got this item hoping to make slicing easier for recipes in my slow cooker. It was unable to handle carrots, small pieces of potatoes, onions, or indeed, anything except garlic... It's quite good with garlic if you quarter the clove first. Recommended only if you have small, crisp items that need to be minced (for the record, rosemary is hopeless). For the record, take my review with a grain of salt - I'm not exactly a seasoned chef :)"
1,"""Pro"" failure","Chopped onions etc pre-cut thin for small meals. Peppers, etc. After less than a dozen used, it failed to rotate the blade. Comfortable grip, used to throw it into the trash."
2,"not New, as stated in the description","This is an 'ok' product. But, it showed signs of obvious wear, this was not NEW! I didn't bother going to the trouble of returning it because it works ok. It is not as well made as the pamper chef chopper I had a few years ago."
4,KitchenAid Pro Food Chopper from Amazon,"I never thought I needed this kind of cooking tool. I've always chopped garlic, and minced onions and some other vegies I wanted in small pieces ""by hand"" I bought it on a lark when I was purchasing another kithen tool I needed from Amazon, and happened to notice this KitchenAid Pro Food Chopper. As it was reasonable in price, and had some favorable reviews I thought why not! I'm glad because it does a good job, is easy to use and clean. It also does a fine job on walnuts."
2,Poor Product,"Took this product on its first test run. Let's just say I need to go to the store to get some super glue. The top knob broke off before we were finished. Poor workmanship on the manufactures side. I bought Kitchaid for a reason, bad choice."
1,Plastic cup cracked in 2 months!,"We bought this to chop nuts (almonds and hazelnuts) and dried fruit to make homemade muesli, and it worked pretty well though we originally found that it was tricky to reassemble after washing so that it functioned correctly (push-rotate-push-rotate) but were fairly happy once we figured that out. However after only 2 months of use (a cup of nuts/fruit) every 3 days, and handwashing only, the plastic cup has developed a crack. It can still be used for now, but we expect the crack to grow."
1,Cheap,It is impossible to clean the blades Unless I am doing something wrong it will make someone sick from the food the gets stuck inside this thing.
2,KitchenAid Food chopper,I have to admit...I expected more from KitchenAid....this chopper does not chop nearly as well as I thought it would ....food has to be peeled or trimmed just so in order for chopper to do it's job properly and that causes the whole process to be very time consuming....defeats the purpose of using it....and cleaning the blade adequately is difficult and aggravating.....I mustn't be doing something right regarding the cleaning of this item as I am surprised at the high ratings others have given it.....for the price it is cheap.....
1,You'll brake your hand,You have to slap this thing around like you hate it. If you have a lot of anger to release then this is for you.The blades are dull and it's super noisy.I thought this would save time BUT I can grab my knife and ninja things into regular sized pieces quicker then I can beat the veg / meat into submission (& with more consistent results too).I'm SO CHEAP but I used this THING 1 time & threw it away. What a waste of $$$ & that makes me sad especially in this economy.
2,Kitchen Aid Pro Food Chopper,"I previously had a Zylis food chopper which worked well but the plastic frame fell apart after years of use. I purchased this Kitchen Aid one, thinking it would be comparable. It is not a very good chopper. It often sticks when vigorously chopping and it does not chop that well."
2,KitchenAid Food Chopper,I couldn't get this to chop 1/4 of a pre-chopped onion. The onions kept getting lodged between the blades.
1,Is not a time saver,This is not what I expected; does not chop evenly so I wind up taking the cutting board out anyway and re-chopping.
1,do not buy,"Just does not work right at all! Did not chop well was hard to us, very disappointed in this product"
1,"Good contents, but what a bad publication","I won't go in to the contents of this book, but look at the quality of this publication. It is printed -I suspect even photocopied- onto really cheap, thin paper. The copy I had was badly glued together and not straight. Some footnotes are incomplete as if they were of the printable area. The margins of the pages vary throughout the book and text shines trough. It is not worth its price.If you want this book, do order it from a different publisher. Dover has published it for instance.... You'll save money and get a good quality paperback."
1,Herbal Tea,"Well I wrote a review for the Herb seeds that I purchased, and basically the same thing happened with the herbal tea seeds as well, I planted in my normal seed germination peat moss mixture, and covered with plastic wrap as I do with all new seedlings, and none have sprouted, I recently planted some seeds at approximately the same time as I planted these seeds, but the other seeds I purchased last year from Burpee and they have sprouted and are doing very well, highly disappointed, would really like a refund on both the items that I purchased, what a waste of time, space, and seed starter!"
1,Do Not Buy,"Sorry to post my very first bad review, but please do not buy this item. I have had a garden for years so I know how to grow one. Only one herb grew after planting them all. Please think about it before buying this brand."
1,old seeds,I was sent seed packets that where packaged for spring 2010. I doubt those are going to grow but guess I'll see. There werent very many seeds in them either. And good thing I had other planting instructions because the packets didn't desplay deepth to plant the seeds or if the plant liked shade or sun. Some packages only made 2 1/2 six packs once planted. One packet of seeds should make at least 5 or 6 sixpacks.Thought I was getting a deal but got less seeds and old seeds when I could have went to Homedepot and got better stuff for $2 more. Wont be buying seeds from this Generic Company anymore.
5,Camino Norte al Infierno,"The drugtraficker's History is Colombian real history of crimen and corruption. It's very informative and you can read it easy, fast and enjoibly."
5,Incredible,"I found this stained, rumpled and crumpled book under the drivers seat of my husbands pickup (what's up with that?); so I didn't really buy it, but I have to say, now having read it, that I would have bought it in the first place--it's udderly fantastic! Some of the stories are short and quick and some are a bit longer(we all know why they are that short or long teehee), but all of them get right to the point of the book--sex. And cowboy lesbian sex at that! Ride 'em cowgirl, Yeehaw! Some of them are so steamy they are sure to get you...you know...and the others, well, they are just so artiscly written it's a pleasure to read. How come all the best writers write erotica?! I may not be a lesbian, but after reading this: things that make you go...hmmmm. I'd better not let my husband see that I have this book, he'll wonder why I keep going down the road to see those women at the stables!"
4,Aqua Lover,This is another step for the dance crazed people! I have this and i like the beat of #3 the best (it's the metro scuba club mix) The guys really can make a dance mix out of a ballad. If your a Aqua lover like me don't pass this album up.
4,great color,"This product gives a great natural color, but the bronzer is not at all water resistant. It streaks and looks nasty if you sweat or get any part of you damp. It does not fade nicely but more lizzard like. For the price you cannot get a better color unless you use a tanning bed."
3,"Not bad, but written in 1962!","While overall I think this is a very handy little phrasebook, and the pronunciations are nicely done, it's important to know that it is a Dover reprint of a book last updated in 1962.For that reason, if you follow the book's suggestions unquestioningly, you may sound like a throwback to another era -- or a jerk. No one summons a waiter by saying ""Garcon!"" anymore. (The term these days is Monsieur.) You're liable to get terrible service if you try it.It's best to use this book for words that don't change much over time, like names of foods, please and thank you, etc. Don't rely on it for any kind of new technology (it just isn't in there), for fashion (you probably aren't going to ask for that sweet little hat in the window or a pair of dungarees) or for anything that might be influenced by the enormous social changes of the last 40+ years!"
1,What a disappointment!,"This is one of the worst written books I've ever read! The editor must have been asleep when reviewing this manuscript. It is so bad that I began editing it myself a third of the way through just to keep my interest up. London uses the same phrases over and over to describe characters and their emotions. By the end of the book I was ready to scream from Culley's repeated mental self-abuse over not being ""good enough"" to touch Sable. The build up of Piers as the villian was not followed up by any suspense and the resulting death scene lent itself to some of the funniest dialogue in the book! Please don't insult the intelligence of romance readers by passing off half-written drival as quality work. Clearly London was not giving her all to what was a promising concept. A pity for her fans."
3,An Okay book,"The book jacket sounded pretty good but this author's writing seemed so stiff and wordy - like a bad soap opera dialogue. I, like some of the other readers found parts of the book that didn't match up to the previous page - I had to make sure some of the pages weren't missing.I don't think I will read this author anytime soon - too little time - too many better authors!!"
5,Ignorant bliss,"I agree. I have trained under Dana and Chueng and I was appalled when I read that person's degrading comments.There is always a rotten apple, it is unfortunate..."
5,Perfect for Teens,I used this video in conjunction with my 7th grade lesson on birds. It was excellent! It supported what we had been learning and the kids enjoyed watching it. They had many new questions about birds after we watched the video. I highly recommend this whole series.
3,Good Daily Reading Guide,"If you need a daily schedule for reading, this book fits the bill. This is really two books in one -- the 40-week complete track and the 32-week fast track. Pick one. Each day lists 3 to 6 Bible chapters for reading and about 3 to 6 questions for personal study.Our Bible study group just finished the 40-week track together. I found the questions to be repetitive in style, spotty in their coverage, unimaginative, and not that good for discussion purposes."
2,"Invalid Proofs, Disorganized Postulates","This book seems to be pretty good until it gets to the proofs section. At that point, it requires you to complete their invalid proofs which take information that are not given to make correct uses of the postulates that they defined. I am still in search of a good Geometry book, and this is not the one."
4,Good Introduction,"Especially in light of the relatively recent dissoultion of the Soviet Union it is becoming necessary to understand the former-Soviet Union in its modern context as the Commwealth of Independent States. This book provides a good overview of Russian history from the founding of the Russian nation until today. Also, a portion of the book is devoted to an effective overview of the minorities and republics outside of Russia from Estonia to Tajikistan. Much like the other books in this series, an excellent introduction meant to whet your appetite for further exploration into the subject matter."
3,Decent screen cleaner,"This cleaner does a decent job, but I don't think it was worth the cost of the cleaner. Overall, it did work to clean the screens, but I don't feel I would buy it again."
5,Perfect,The best price around for this cleaning kit. Works great and is a must to keep screens looking their best!I use this on a glossy screen and it makes it look brand new.
1,Isoproply Alcohol nothing more.,Isoproply Alcohol and with a fancy cleaning wipe. Don't bother with this. Just go to the store and buy Isoproply Alcohol with microfiber cloths and you get the same or better results.
3,Works Ok....,"This cleans your LCD monitor, but not as well as I expected. The instructions tell you to spray directly on the the application stick. I recommend you spray directly on your monitor. Otherwise, it doesn't seem to clean at all."
3,LCD Cleaner,"The cleaner is good, I suppose, but the spayer that held it had a mal-function. There was a unfinished cover over the hole where the licquid was supossed to come out----so a spray was prevented. I had to throw it out."
5,Works well,Excellent product for flat screen TV as well as monitors. Removed grandson's fingerprints from our flat screen easily and without leaving any indication he'd ever touched the screen to begin with. Highly recommend.
2,Beautifully incomplete!,"I ordered these sent to myself because I am fed up with FTD and want to find a company I can trust for my far away flower orders. They were scheduled to be delivered on Monday but I received them on the Friday before. Early is better than late but it's not ideal. The bouquet was styled beautifully and the flowers look healthy and smell wonderful.Here's the kicker- I didn't receive a single rose! I understand that substitutions sometimes happen in accent pieces, but this item has ROSE bouquet in the name. There are extra lilies and the presentation is full but don't count on the description given. If I just want someone to have something pretty and I don't care what it is, I might order from this company again, but my close family won't be getting flowers this spring.Five stars for the stylist and one to the logistics team."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I got this Barbie/Kelly set for my daughter, who turned 6 and HAD to have it. We were both disappointed that the ""giggling"" and other things that Kelly says, comes from BARBIE. There is a button on Barbie's back that you push, and Kelly's dialog comes from her. It just seemed weird! It would have made much more sense to put the sounds on the swingset itself.The swingset is nice. It comes apart easily, which might be troublesome, unless you opt to glue it with something like Krazy Glue gel (which glues anything)."
3,"Dolls are cute, swing falls apart","My three year old received this set as a gift and was thrilled... her 1st Barbie. However, the swing set fell apart quickly after she started to play with it. We thought about glueing it together but we cannot find all the pieces. Don't buy it for the swing. The dolls have lasted and they are worth it."
4,Lotsa Pieces!,"My three-year-old loved the toy and still plays with both dolls, but the swing and slide are easy to disassemble and the pieces end up scattered all about the house. It does seem a bit odd that you press a button on Barbie to make Kelly giggle and say ""whee"" - a feature that doesn't make sense when the dolls are used separately. I'd recommend it, but be ready to chase little pieces everywhere!"
5,My Daughter Loves This Toy !,I got this toy for my 7 yr. old daughter for xmas. she loves it ! and plays with it alot ! she likes when Kelly giggles !
5,My 4 year old loves this,My 4 year old has had this set for about 6 months and just loves it. The pieces are easy enough for her to put together.
5,Cool,I have this barbie. I like it because the barbie can talk and the swingset is cool. You should buy it because it's fun to play with. I am six years old and my friends and I love it and play with it all the time.
3,Disappointment,"While the dolls on this toy are a lot of fun for my daughter to play with, the poles on the swing refused to stay together. My son finally took them and uses them for Bat poles with his Batman action figures. It would be a great toy if the swing could somehow stay together, but since it can't I wouldn't recommend buying it unless the dolls themselves appeal to your child."
4,Great Game,My husband received this game for his birthday! I do agree you can't be sensative! I imagine this game being the best on a hot summer night with about 4-5 couples! Having a theme party where everyone dresses in island wear and you have tiki lights and appetizers! We played this game today with only 4 people so it was fun but could have been more fun with 2 more couples! I recommend it highly! I feel bad for anyone that gets voted off the first time unanimously......that could be the end of a perfect evening! :0 But I find that hard to believe!
5,Review by: Angela ...,"This game was fun and helped me understand what to do to survive in the wild!I am an only child (but, I have an adopted brother, Nicholas) and have no cousins, therefore, I sometimes have to play with Nick, even him being at a young age of four. This game is easy enough for him, so I believe anyone can play this exciting game."
2,Survivor Stinks,"The Survivor Game is incredibly pointless. Some of the questions were interesting but there is absolutely no strategy to the game. The instructions were vague and left several key points out. We found the game tedious and boring. And to top it off, voting other players out of the game killed the friendly spirit we had started with."
5,Survivor The Game,"When I first bought this game I wasn't sure if it would be fun. Well when I opened it up and figured out all the directions I got my friends and we had a blast. I give this game ""5"" stars. This game was really, really fun, and easy. I was the 6th one to get votes out of the game but a well. There were 8 of us and we had a ball. I love this game. The only thing that really is boring about the game is having nothing to do when you get voted out. Oh Well. I still give this game ""5"" stars. Count em' ""5"" STARS!!!!"
1,Survivor is a WASTE OF MONEY,"Bought it for a party and boy, were we disappointed. What a horrible way to determine the winner! The questions are incredibly difficult (unless you're an anthropologist) - and there are too few of them - making the game totally unreplayable. This is a LAME ripoff that someone took about a half hour to come up with. Go buy ""Loaded Questions"" or ""Cranium"" if you want to have fun. You have been warned."
3,How To Rip Your Marriage Apart In 2 Short Hours,"Four couples got together to play this game, and no sooner was the first person voted out of the tribe than the fur began to fly! For Survivor enthusiasts, this game is a lot of fun. But for those who don't care about the game and easily get their feelings hurt, it is extremely agitating. Plus, after you are voted out, there is nothing to do but wait until the final 2 make their pleas before the jury. That was over 2 hours for us. Think long and hard before playing this at a couples party. Or be prepared to have lawyers on the phone!!"
4,WE LOVE IT!,Our family just loves this game. We take it with us on vacation and or simply play at home against each other. Very educational and very fun!
5,More thorough than many -- & fun,"My kids were quite willing to practice with this. I'd thought that because it was a little more ""technical"" rather than game-like that they'd be resistant. But they felt like they were always making progress.Not sure about compatability problems: we ran it from a lap-top that we plugged into MIDI keyboard & it worked great."
3,Decent for a specific need,"This was definitely a project to put together and the directions should have notes for some details in assembly. There were two specific areas where a piece fits two ways, but should really go one way to be correct. Unfortunately, the directions are more crude pictures than word labels and I found the problems after I was almost done. So I had to take it apart and build it again.This is definitely a two person job of assembly. If I had more yard space I would have gone with a bigger building made of stronger material. This building works really well up next to my house because I don't have a large yard it really maximizes the space I do have."
2,Very Frustrated with this product,"My dad bought this shed and asked me to help him assemble it. It says it takes 2 people 2 to 3 hours to put together. NOT TRUE. The instructions are almost completely pictures which are kind of helpful but they leave out some important notes. For instance, in several places there is more than one way that a piece can be put in but it needs to be put in one specific way to fit with something else later and there are no notes to give you that information. Most of the holes do not line up so it is a pain to put together once you have figured out what piece is actually needed. There are tons of different pieces and most of the labels came off before we opened the box so it was a guessing game to figure out which piece was needed. The roof doesn't lay very flat and shows quite a bit of sunlight through, so if you do not want bugs or water getting in you will need to silicone around almost the entire thing."
1,"""review"" greatly appreciated","Because of the ""alert"" review, I was able to cancel my order of this item. Over $10 shipping is outrageous for an item that fits in a wallet, and could as easily fit in a .37 cent envelope. Thank you for providing reviews. M.J. Muxlow"
3,3 out of 5 (60 %),"2 of them are very hard to get light, you have twist then to get a light (which mean you have to used both hand).3 of them are perfect.That why I say I am 3 / 5 (60%) satisfied"
4,Great freezer bags,I really like these bags for storing my breast milk in the freezer since they take up such little space and I would have given them 5 stars but if you drop the bag while it has frozen milk in it the sides split and you won't know that until you thaw out the milk and it's all over your fridge.
1,Leaks when frozen,I switched to these because they held 6oz but every one I've frozen so far has leaked - even if I thaw them in the fridge.
2,"These are the best bags out there, but they still aren't good enough","I chose these bags partly because of the reviews that I read on this website and because they made economic sense. I gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed. I have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply. However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom. I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place. My solution was to use bottles. They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice."
2,poor performer,"The first time I was a breastfeeding mother I used Gerber breastmilk bags, and I had no problems. This time all the stores seemed to only carry Lansinoh brand bags, so I purchased them. The 2nd box I had I poured breastmilk into and it leaked all over my counter, this happened multiple times. I called the company and complained they sent me another box of bags, I used these and subsequent bags without a problem. But now after the milk has been frozen and taken out to defrost in warm water the bags ALWAYS bust and we have water and breastmilk together. Gerber brand never had a problem, I do not recommend this product!"
5,No complaints from an occasional pumper,"I am lucky to be a stay-at-home mom, and only pump occasionally, but when I do these bags are great! After reading reviews on this and several other bags, each one seemed to have good and bad reviews, but I have nothing bad to say about these Lansinoh bags. My son is 5 months old now, and I pump 1-2 times a week at the most for a small outing/emergency supply. These bags are pretty easy to fill (just be careful pouring) and seal. I cinch the bag between two of my fingers right at the milk line, then ""zipper"" the bag all the way to the lock line with my fingers to get rid of any air bubbles. The double-zipper lock is also a definite plus. I lay them flat to freeze in my standard door freezer, then store them long-term in my deep freeze after they are solid. Fortunately I have never had any problems with leaking. I have recently increased the amount that I pump, so I'm planning on buying another box! If you try them, I hope they work well for you too."
1,"Leaks, leaks, leaks","We bought these because we liked the safety of the double-zipper. But it doesn't do much good when the bags leak. 10%-20% of the time the bags leak when you defrost. Why take that risk with your ""liquid gold""."
5,Breast Milk Storage Bags,"These are the ONLY breast milk storage bags I will use. I have tried many other brands, none of them compare to the Lansinoh bags. They are very sturdy and if you freeze them flat you can fit a huge amount in your freezer. You can fill them easily and they pour easily."
1,Weak seams & zip lock does not seal,"I originally liked these bags because they held LOTS of milk! However, they don't stand up right which causes them to fall on their sides. This wouldn't be a problem if they didn't leak out of the top. It is a zip lock top, but it somehow still leaks. This has happened to me many times. I started to lean them up against other items in my fridge to keep them from falling over and making a huge sticky mess which worked most of the time. When I put them in my freezer (standing of course) the milk expanded and broke the seams on the sides of the bag, again creating a huge sticky mess."
1,Leaks Leaks Leaks!,"I usually use the Gerber Nuk bags, but purchased these when the store was out of the Nuk. Four out of five bags have leaked in the last day. I am not a happy mama."
1,leak easily,"It's happened a couple of times that these bags leaked while thawing. I am extremely careful with them as the milk is too precious to spill so it's not carelessness. Bags have even leaked just sitting in the fridge, in a plastic container. I now put every milk bag into a ziploc bag for 'safety'. I don't trust these bags anymore and will only use the first years bags, they have proven to be much sturdier so far and are more acurate in the ounces."
4,Good storage option,"I've used them since I've gone back to work to store breast milk. They're great. I like the double zip, tissue-like dispense pack design and most importantly the tab for writing the date of expression and volume is separate (easy to read and will not bleed through). They allow me to freeze flat. The only slight disappointment is that it does not fit exactly in the freezer storage box I have (the sides are a little crunched) but I can still use them in it. I know other reviewers have lamented the accuracy of the volume; but it you stand it up on it's bottom so it can stand on its own (carefully of course, it is liquid gold!) it's pretty accurate. I would highly recommend these!"
1,They leak!,"Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your milk! These bags leaked worse than Gerber, The 1st Years and Medela bags. This always happened when thawing. I really can't recommend any plastic bag for milk storage. I just started using 8oz glass bottles since I tend to express more than 4oz in the mornings. Using bottles is more cost effective in the long run, and you won't have to throw any milk out due to spoilage or leaks."
1,Leaked about 80% time,"I used 3 different kinds of storage bags (first time mom, decided to do my own little test). Dr. Brown's bags are the best, never leaked, accurate measurements, then Gerber bags, accurate measurements when you stretch out bag. The lansinoh bags are horrible!! I weaned after 8 months. I thawed my precious milk for my baby and nearly every lansinoh bag leaked causing me to have to throw out my breastmilk I worked so hard pumping to save for him after I weaned. DO NOT BUY THESE. Save your money and buy the Dr. Brown's bags."
1,LEAKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have frozen close to 100 bags, no more than 6 ozs each. I have now thawed out 30-40 bags and every single bag has leaked! I lost 2 or 3 bags before I realized it was not operator error. I now have to thaw them in a mug in the fridge to catch the milk. I used the Gerber bags with my older son and never had any problems."
1,"LEAK! We lost 30-40oz of pumped milk, many hours of my wife's labor and our babies food.","DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCTS FROM Lanishoh.I am absolutely disgusted with this company and their products. We've lost 30-40oz of pumped milk. We always filled the bags to the correct maximum, and evened out bags that were over-full. We kept the bags in a safe freezer that was solely used for the storage of milk. There was no damage, the was no miss handling. Yet, several bags have leaked, the first few caused a huge mess which was just insult to injury. This is food that my daughter will not be able to eat, this is effort and loss of sleep and pain that my wife went through to extract that lost milk. I am absolutely outraged with this company and their defective products.Considering the number of complaints of leaking I wonder if there's sufficient grounds for a class action lawsuit against Lanishoh."
4,Spilled Milk...,I have been very pleased with the durability and quality of these bags. The only problem I have is pouring the milk out of the bags! I just can't find an easy way to pour the milk out without spilling it everywhere!FYI to the Babysitter :)The best (less spilled milk) way is to cut the corner to empty the bag.
2,Beware of Leaks,"I purchased these bags because they were cheaper than the others and I liked the idea of the double zipper at the top; however, I have quickly discovered that it's not the leaks from the top that I need to worry about, it's the leaks from other parts of the bag. Three out of the past five times I have defrosted milk in these bags they have leaked due to holes in the bag (twice from holes on the side and once from a hole in the bottom).I would not recommend purchasing these bags, or, if you do, thaw them in a cup or bowl so that you do not lose your valuable milk."
4,My next best choice,"I've used the Pigeon brand (I believe it's from Japan) milk storage bags- those are the best-quality bags I've ever used. Unfortunately, they're also very difficult to find. These Lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1/3 of Pigeon's price. Not bad at all! My baby and I travel a lot so I bring along my stock of bmilk in these Lansinoh bags. No mishaps thus far. Highly recommended."
2,Beware of leaking bags...,"I used the Lansinoh bags to store my milk- placing them in a deep freeze. The upsides were that they were cheaper and easy to use. However, when thawing most of the bags they would leak all over. I would lose at least 1 to 2 precious ounces each time I would thaw a bag. For all the work that nursing moms have to go through in order to put milk in storage this is horrific. I had much better luck thawing other brands, stay away from these if you want to actually use your milk!"
5,More like a Shiver down my spine!,Edison Glass is one of those bands that you dream about discovering. This is there first album and its good. They don't sound like anyone else that I'm aware of and they have a bit of reggae and punk/rock mix. This is an album that I will buy for friends.
5,Awesome!,"This album is amazing. If you like Mae, Dennison Marrs, Mute Math and House of Heroes, this is an album you should consider picking up. Edison Glass's music is refreshing, exciting and while their sound isn't exactly new to the scene, they definitely can execute it well. If you're looking for a great sound with clever, meaningful lyrics, this is the CD to buy."
5,You can do it too!,"I received my ""Let's Get Stepping"" DVD and used it within a day. I was so excited to get back into stepping. I was an avid stepper about fifteen years ago and simply LOVED it! I had to quit stepping due to a skiing injury, and never got back to the classes. In the meantime I gained a significant amount of weight and was terrified I would never make it through a step workout again. When I found this DVD that was made specifically for real women with real curves, I was anxious to try it in the privacy of my own living room. Her workout is motivating and she teaches you all the moves you will need in a tutorial prior to the full work-out. I appreciated that the women working out with her on the DVD were also voluptuous vixens. Her personal story of going from a 300# size 26 to a now much slimmer and healthier size 12 was enough to make me get off the couch and start moving.If she can do it, so can I, and so can you!"
4,PLEASED TO SEE PLUS SIZED GIRLS,"i was pleasantly surprised to actually see plus sized women doing the exercises in this video. am very pleased with workout. but feel it's just i little much (long) for a true ""beginner"". i have already recommended it to friends"
2,Definitely a beginner,"If your are brand new to step aerobic, I guess this would be okay. But the workout is BEGINNER and low energy. The only thing good was the music which was a nice change from the usual."
2,boring exercise program,Yipes. This was extremely boring. The instructor is well intended but seemed to be struggling doing the step herself which wasn't exactly inspirational. I used it once and filed it away.
3,Not as good as I hoped,"Based on the positive reviews here, I bought this dvd and found it to be a bit lacking for me. The movements were way too repetitive and easy so it got tedious and boring very quickly - and I'm a beginner stepper. The workout was not intense and it barely got my heart rate going. Also, Debra is a bit annoying and preachy. I like the fact that the women in the class were not thin and fit women because it does show that anyone can do this routine, but it just wasn't to my taste. If you're a basic beginning stepper who is looking for an easy routine than by all means get this dvd. I probably will only use it for days when I'm looking for an easy workout."
5,Excellent workout.,Shapely Girl is an excellent workout. It has been sometime since I have done step and it is a great way to get back into it. The moves and transitions are easy to follow. Love it!
2,"thanks for the ""Our Father""",I have burned Our Father to my library. Thanks guys for the beautiful irony! Too bad you don't put your talents to such good use otherwise.
2,I was really dissapointed.,"I was hoping that by choosing an artist with the Metal Blade label, I would be guaranteed a heavy hitting album. That was not the case. I was under the impression that these guys were a new band that no one had heard much of and they really had something to show off. They couldnt keep with one kind of music ranging anywhere from vienna choirboys to somewhere around the early 90's version of Testament. I wouldnt waste my money on this album. If you are looking for the hardcore metal, I recommend giving Six Feet Under's new album ""Maximum Violence"" A listen, and you can never go wrong with bands like Slayer, Mercyful Fate and At The Gates."
5,Enlightening,"I used this book to re-aquiant me with p3; unbelievable. The approach is EXACTLY what you need - wrote by a user, not a techy. It expains in plain Elgish good practices to schedule appraoch and development; multidisciplinary concepts universal to Oil / Gas / Construction / Civils.An absolute must have - ideal for the uni student to beyond..."
4,This book is very informative for those who don't know.,"This book is very straight and to the point. All the questions you could possibly have, have been answered. Very informative for those who don't know about female orgasms or those who think they know. Great for male readers-it gives them a very clear idea on where the most sensitive area is on a woman and how to touch her correctly and rythmatically to bring her to the most rewarding outcome. Great for women who have never had an orgasm who want to learn in private to make their mates eye open with surprise! Could not put it down-a must read for beginners....."
2,Not Helpful,"This book was for women who have never had an orgasm during sex, not who have never had one. Although the first step is about learning to have an orgasm by yourself, she acts like this will be easy and doesn't address solutions for women who can't even complete the first step. She doesn't think it's an issue at all if you feel like you have to hide this from your partner or if your partner isn't supportive. She also advocates faking orgasms; she even has a story about a woman whose therapist told her to stop faking orgasms and her partner left her for being ""frigid."" The answer to that was to get a new therapist, not that the partner was a jerk. The goal of this book is laudable, but she completely ignores women who just want to orgasm on their own or that the most important step to orgasming with a partner is communication!"
3,its ok,It takes too long to get to the important topic. Too many stories that are not important. Not intimate but selfish. I think its helpful for people who never had an orgasm. But for people who do know how and have a partner it is not as good.
5,Great model Airport Hanger,"Gave this to my grandson, who has an airport set up. He loved it. It completed his hanger area on the airport site."
3,Great Chess Board,I have always wanted a real wooden board to play chess on and this board has given me that.It is rich and attractive and something I plan on having with me for a very long time.My wooden pieces that I bought in Germany almost 50 years ago feel at home on this board
3,thinner than I expected and the board was damaged slightly on one corner due to improper packing,"I received this board today and feel a little bid sad.1. the board is thinner than expected.2. one corner was damaged during shipping, improper packing, the box is too big and only one side gets protected and damage happened to one corner and one side. This made me sad. want to return it. :-("
1,Warped board and Walnut colored board but not wood,"I read the reviews and was expecting a nice board for my son's birthday gift. The board arrived quickly and was boxed well. Unfortunately when opened, the board was so warped that it was returned immediately. The board is not wood it is a laminate and cheaply made. This is not a walnut board rather it is a walnut colored board."
5,Beautiful,Love this. I bought it as a gift and it was so pretty. It is good quaily wood and has a great finish. The color contrast is great yet no so jarring as a traditional black and white board. It makes a great board to play on and a great board to display your favortie chess set on.
2,Doesn't deliver what the cover promises,"""Selling a screenplay"" doesn't deliver on its title and is quite dated. While the content is a fairly interesting read, Syd is mostly name dropping and telling his own personal stories of how he got to work on various projects. He's fond of telling us what restaurant he met various big shots in, but really does not deliver any ""how to"" information.The dollar figures he cites must be way out of date. He often makes references to ""upcoming movies"" that are now distant memories. The book is good for a quick skim and does give you a sense of how the industry works, but it certainly doesn't do deliver what it's cover promises: ""how to pitch, sell, and market your screenplay."""
2,Selling a Screenplay,"I think for this book the title: The Screenwriter's Guide to Hollywood is OK.But, ""Selling a Screenplay"" ought to be omitted.The book is great as far as getting a clear idea of how long it takes before a screenplay finally makes it on the screen. It does not address the expectation of the novice screenwriter of what to do after the screenplay is finished and ready to hit the road, knocking on doors.The novice wants to know where to send it if he has no connections or an agent, what should be included in the package, and how to do it in a professional manner that is proper and acceptable."
3,A good place to start,"This is a good, solid introduction to selling your screenplay and finding an agent. There's nothing much here that isn't found in a lot of other books, but someone starting will find this really useful."
1,Screenwriters Avoid this Book,"I am a first time screenwriter and I read this book to get an Idea of whom and how to submit my script to. This book never addresses this at all. The majority of the book is discussing how impossible it is to get something read and or produced. When you finished reading this book you feel like the odds are so against you that it might be easier to finance and produce the movie yourself. Also, who the heck is Syd Field anyway? I went on IMDB and couldn't find a lick about him that is relative to the industry today. AVOID THIS BOOK. Negative vibes."
1,Save your money.,This music scared my dog and annoyed me. I challenge anyone to listen to this CD more than a few times without losing their mind. There are much better products in this category to choose from. Save your money and don't buy this one.
1,Songs to make dogs happy or kids happy?,"Got this cd from a friend. I was delighted as I have a couple Perry Wood cds that are wonderful for both me and my pup. I thought this would be along the same lines. However, as I played it, it seemed to have come from something a kid with good intentions would put together for a dog, something a kid would think would make dogs happy. It's made up of a bunch of silly songs that are somewhat annoying. I prefer instrumental music that has scientifically been designed to connect with canines."
4,Songs To Make Dogs Happy,This CD was recommended to help keep your dog calm. I enjoyed listen to the songs and hope that my dog did too. Songs To Make Dogs Happy is doggy recommended.
1,Zero stars for this one!,I can't believe I paid good money for this! It is just a bunch of kindergarten songs. My dog barked at it as though an intruder had entered the house. I wish I could get a refund.
5,Problem with CD,"Due to the CD sticking in the car cd player and having to take the car to the auto/stereo place to ""boot"" the player; I exchanged the CD for a new one, same songs. However, this CD also sticks. No other CD's (7) stick. Anyone else have a problem or solution?I love the music, want more"
5,Funny music,"First thing you have to do, is roll up your car windows before you play this c.d.! This is kind of like your friends finding out you read the Enquirer or the Reader's Digest. It would be embarrasing.It is kind of addictive with corny, easy to learn lyrics and sound effects meant for your dog will enjoy. Some of the sounds are meant to sound like a dog 'laughing' the 'huff,huff,huff' sound they sometime make-it's cute."
5,Listen WITH your dog!,"I don't think some of the reviewers actually followed the instructions in this cd. You are supposed to listen WITH your dog for the first few weeks and then they can also enjoy it without you. For the first five times, we listened with our dogs while petting them and playing with them. Now, as soon as they hear it, they wag and are obviously happy. After a few songs, they lie down and are totally relaxed. It's a great tool if you are looking for a way to break through and communicate kindness to a rescued dog. Eli & Marleigh LOVE it when I put the cd in and it is something, albeit a little ""corny"" that we can experience together. Then when I leave, they feel soothed by it. Nay-sayers are all wrong. This is a great cd and I defy any listener to not smile at least a little bit -- and tap a toe or four!"
2,Oh I can't stand it!,"I appreciate the time that this person put into chatting with Critters. I would have to disagree with the statement that ""dogs love"" it.. my dogs hate it!I was by (not at.. but by) a freestyle demonstration, paying no attention to what was going on there. I was looking at something else, my dogs in tow.. when I suddenly hear from my dogs (I'm also an animal communicator) ""Oh I can't stand it! Please make it stop!"".. it was Squeaky Deaky. I understand their pain!I do have to admit that many dogs did seem to enjoy to music. I can't get it out of my head. It's cutesy and fun but my dogs didn't really care for it. Maybe becuase I have Bullmastiffs and they are not known to be ""cutesy"".I would suggest that if you want to find music that your dogs like, find something that appeals to you... we pick the dogs we have for a reason.. we usually have similar energy...chances are if you like it, they will like it."
4,"Lots of pictures, short on info.","I loved this book, but I wish it had more details about the Arena itself. For example the book twice mentions the basement in the Arena, but nowhere does it describe this basement. I would have liked to see more details. Overall the best (and only) book dedicated to the great St. Louis Arena that is near to many hearts."
3,good product. delivery way too slow,"the product condition was actually way better than expected but the delivery took way too long, needed the book to study for an exam but got it a week after the exam... a little too late"
2,"Unreadable, but unignorable","Like other products of obsession - Henry Darger's work, for example - this novel has a peculiar, rather unwholesome authority. There's no mistaking that every line is ""poetry written with a splash of blood"", to use Yukio Mishima's phrase. I have to agree with Salman Rushdie when he gallantly claimed that this book was ""worth ten safe well-written little novels.""Nonetheless, ""The Runaway Soul"" has to be shelved alongside other years-in-the-writing would-be masterpieces like ""The Rosy Crucifixion"" and ""Ancient Evenings"" as a noble failure. It's possible that Brodkey just chewed his cud a few years too long. (The ""sketch versions"" of this material collected in ""Stories in an Almost Classical Mode"" are substantially more rewarding, in my opinion.) Whatever the reason, he fails to transmute his suffering into literature on anything like a consistent basis. Brodkey would have done well to heed the editorial advice of an old Danish queen: ""More matter and less art."""
5,This game is Awesome just like the Game Boy Colar,"This game is so tight. It is better than The Legacy of Goku for the GBA. This game was put on the best Game Boy console in the world,Game Boy Colar. Yes Game Boy Colar is better than the GBA (Game Boy Advance). I think so because it is more better and has better graphics and all the best games were m ade for it. So like I said DragonballZ Legendary Super Warriors is the second best game for the Game Boy Colar. The first best games are the three best of all time Pokemon Red,Blue,and Yellow.This is my review for DragonBallz Legendary Super Warriors."
3,I am being neutral,"After the phenominal success of Legacy of Goku (like their was any doubt) it seemed obviouse that the they should do a follow up right? But why in the blue hell are they makeing it for Game Boy Color? The way this looks right off the bat it looks lie it might be an RPG, howver some later screen shots later revealed the possibilty of it being a fighting game. As it stands right now I will remain neutral in this until I read some profesional reviews (sorry you customer reviews just don't cut it). I think the intelligent thing to do (if a fighting game or RPG) would be to place it on the Game Boy Advance where the graphics are far superior, as well as controls and sound. End result, Game Boy color is Dead, time to wake up and smell the next generation."
4,DBZ,"I love dragon ball z, this game is fun to play. The game play and action is awesome. Recommend this to any dragon ball z fans."
4,Dont hate on a great game,"Well Well Well,they continued to release dragonball games in america.Its about time.I love dragonball,but I got the shaft on the playstation games being so rare and all.Today I bought this game DBZ legendary Super warriors.I went and dug out my gameboy color from the deepest reaches of my closet,but Ill tell you,I was not let down.I dont think every game needs great graphics.However they are good for a game boy color game.The game had great gameplay which will keep you playin and a difficulty level that will ... you off so much that youll never quit till ya win.I give this an 8-10.Its worth $29.99,If your a true dragonball fan and all.Oh and one thing,if you dont know dragonball,the fun level lacks a ton.Dont bother."
4,dbz rules,this game rules. you have a chance to pick over 20 characters. there is multi battle and story mode. story mode is from sagas saiyan to buu saga. you can transform. it rocks
4,Good Game,"Legendary super warriors is really addicting.Dbz fans would only like it though. It runs through the whole storyline, but it misses alot of things. Garlic jr. and King Cold are never seen. This makes the game very quick for experienced gamers. When you beat the game,you get to keep playing and unlocking characters. Its more fun after the game is beaten."
4,good for the price,"I do see a small amount of interference/degradation, but it is almost I perceptible. This cable won't replace an ultra-premium setup, but it will meet your basic needs, and for 30 bucks, it's very hard to justify the price of ultra-premium!"
1,Does not work. Do not purchase.,DVI-D cables have trouble past 5 meters. I hooked this cable up from my macbook to my monitor and I got no signal.This cable is bull*. Do not purchase it.
1,WHAT?? Customer Service sucks,This was listed as: only 2 left for $10.00. I ordered both of them... and the I get an email that my order was cancelled. I checked back at Amazon and there are now 4 in stock at $35.00.THAT SUCKS!!!!
5,great movie,This is a fantastic movie. Simple and sweet. A must see for anybody who believes in delicate and intellectual humor. Check IMDB for confirming details.
3,"An Amusing Little Book, although a bit dated now","I found Lapham's Rules of Influence as I was clearing out some of my books today to make room for others. I glanced through it again before letting it go. I remember getting a couple of interesting ideas from it the first time I read it. The same clever quotes got my attention again. I didn't actually read the entire book carefully either time. I just couldn't get into it enough to settle down and enjoy it properly.I just skimmed, and that was enough for me. Parts of it are still amusing even though somewhat dated. I recognized a few people I know. Maybe they read the book and took it too seriously. It's clever. It's amusing. He is an excellent writer and the small chapters are short enough to read quickly. I've just never been that fond of sarcasm, so it isn't my favorite book. Then again, maybe my life just isn't at a slow enough pace to enjoy the humor of it right now."
3,Teeny Tiny,"I wish I had checked the dimensions before buying, because these are way too small for my average sized cat. The sides are also pretty low, so I didnt even bother trying to get her to use this."
2,children's book,any prospective purchaser should be aware that this is a remedial children's book at best. It's not more than ten pages long and contains information that is easily available on the internet. it's only worth the few good pictures of assemblage pieces by Cornell. the book is not what i thought it would be; maybe my expectations were too high?
4,one of the best european bands this year,"I strongly suggest you to buy this cd. everybody agrees to say they are tremendous. moreover, if you are european, and if you also enjoy Muse, they are touring together. definitely the cd to buy now"
1,Absolutely Mediocre.!!!!!,"It's rare that I leave a 1-star review, but this album deserves it. Comparing this weak 'Jars of Clay' sound to Radiohead is also an insult. The reason that I don't like it is that it is nothing like their 'Too Many DJ's' compilation. There are no dancebeat mixes - no intelligent flow. It's just an absolutely mediocre album, and that's why it was just 97 cents used."
3,Craftsman's Encyclopedia,"For someone outside the house building trade who is looking for help I feel this is an excellent guide. It is very well written, has a very consistent and methodical format. It has lots of great illustrations and very detailed pictures. It's ""Tools needed"" list use tools that are available from any good home center and it uses current up to date aids and techniques."
5,The Bible for taking on the unknown job,"If you're a builder or handyman, chances are that one day you're going to be called on to do something you've never done -- and have no idea how to accomplish.This book has helped me through those times. Not only did it provide me what I needed to know on how to fix or install things -- it gave me estimated manhours for getting the job done. My time seem to take a little longer than the time shown in the book, but maybe that was because I had never done most of the jobs before."
1,Mis-Aligned Laser = useless,"Well, the previous poster had it half-right. The feature he claims is needed (a tool to align the laser) is actually provided. There are two small allen wrench screws near the laser that are intended to be used for that purpose. The only problem is, regardless of how much you try to adjust them, you can never do better than a 10"" diameter circle at 35ft.Far as I'm concerned it's a useless gadget if the laser can't be dialed in to pinpoint accuracy inside of 50ft. Mine goes back to the store tomorrow!"
5,Oh So Good!,"These are hard to find in grocery stores where I live; so it's worth paying for shipping. Although you can find hazelnut flavored creamers anywhere, even sweetened with Splenda now, this is for those of us who like our coffee black. Yum for the Tum."
2,Not as good as originally thought,"After seeing all the great reviews I bought this shaver and liked it at first. However after a year or so I was beginning to wonder if paying $5 a month just to maintain this thing in cleaner was worth it. Then I pulled it out of the cleaner once to see the head was burned. The solution was new and full but I remembered hearing it run an awful lot when it cleaned the previous day. I bought a new head and guess what, the exact same thing happened again about two months later. After years of using Braun's shavers this shaver found its rightful place in the trash and I bought a Norelco 8140XL. It cleans under free running water, shaves better, quieter although more powerful in cutting tough areas, and costs way less to buy and no ""cleaner tax"" to pay every month. I think the new Braun's are grossly overrated."
3,"Good shave, but fragile head","I like the shave, but am getting increasingly annoyed after two shaving heads have broken down in less than a year. The mesh seems to bend and tear and starts cutting one's face. My replacement head broke after three months. The razor and heads are both expensive and this is not what I bargained for ..."
4,Braun Activator,My old Braun 7000 series shaved just as close. The new design foil did not do any better. However it does run quieter and is satisfactory. I purchased it because my old one was about to give out and I did not want to take it to a service center.
4,Nice shaving system,Shaving is close. We have a clean razor every time we pick it up for shaving. The only down side is the noise. Makes noise both while shaving as well as cleaning.Good value for money if you buy it with coupons/rebates for less than [...] bucks.
4,Good for an everyday cleanup,"I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift and he really likes it. He's usually too lazy to shave with a regular razor and shaving cream because it seems like a hassle, but the Braun 8595 makes it a lot easier get rid of the 5 o'clock shadow each day.The cartridges seem expensive, but they seem to last a while. We're still waiting for the Amazon gift certificate that was promised with the purchase though.Overall it was a good buy and he's happy with it."
4,Good Shaver System,"My 4th Braun; my 2nd Activator - wanted a separate one for traveling. The 8000 series has a far superior cleaning system than the 7000 series. Close shave, but not razor close, and that's fine with me. Need to replace the blade head, as recommended, after a year. Performance starts to deteriorate at about 18 months when holder of the blade head starts of loosen up; can be fixed under the 2-yr. warranty. It was reported Proctor & Gamble bought Braun in mid 2006, and soon after, the Activator was renamed 360 Complete with new Gillette blade head. Also reported, basic razor is essentially the same."
2,Lame,"This razor is horrible. I have no idea what they are talking about in those other reviews. This thing doesn't even come close to a good shave. Watch out, becasue if you get and don't like it then you can't even return on amazon...it's becaus of the alchol that it come with (it's a non-returnable item). Wast of 200.00 earned dollars."
5,Braun 8595,This is my 3rd Braun and this one surpasses all of the previous models - wish I had gotten it sooner. Before I got it I thought that the cleaning system was superfluous; after using the cleaning cycle on a daily basis for several weeks now I would not want to be without it! The new design of the cutterhead is a significant improvement over older models. I highly recommend this shaver.
4,Good - Neck area still an issue,I had a 5610 Flex XP cordless electric razor for last two years and bought this one few weeks back. What I wanted was to get a better shave on my neck area which they have advertised as great. I should say I am not 100% impressed by the shave in the neck region. Still I have to move around in different directions to get all the hair out. I am talking about a growth of 2/3 days. My older 5610 Flex XP does a similar job and I would say the improvement in 8595 is 15% more. Over all the system is very good and the cleaning is excellent.
2,Not a Great Shave!,"I've used a Norelco for years but being a gadget guy I bought the little Braun 370 Pocket Twist Plus, battery operated shaver ($10) for my car. I love that little shaver so much I bought a second for my other car. Whether I'm running late or just touching up before a meeting it gives one of the best shaves I've ever had.I was so impressed with the Braun 370 that I thought I'd try out the pricy Braun 8595. What a disappointment! Forget it if you have a fast growing beard. Anything longer than a 5 o'clock shadow is too long for the foil's design. I also takes about twice as long as my Norelco to give me half as good a shave. Add in the cost of the cleaner and the bright light it's really awful. Now it's just taking up space in a drawer until my next garage sale."
2,7000 series vs 8000,the new screen cuts more hairs because it has a large window opening. It is also therefore more irratating for sensitive skin. I have both and did a 1/2 1/2 face study on the 2.
3,Did you say good shaving ?,"I bought this for Xmas as a gift for my husband. So far he only used manual razors but he wanted to give it a try. So I thought that I would spend more money to get a good one. Well, maybe it is as good as an electric razor gets, but the shaving is not near as close as if you use a manual! Can't return it but, won't be used..."
3,Not worth the money,Not worth the cost. My 8 year old Remington actually gave me a closer shave but it was tired and worn out. Save your money and buy a more economic shaver.
4,Far better than others I've tried,"I've tried lots of the other norelco models from costco, but this is the only one that works for me. With the other brands, I never felt like it was actually close enough and the big head on the other brands made me miss spots.So what I don't like is:Cartriges are expensive (you can get them cheaper at taget)It's hard to get certain spots in the grooves of my neckTakes longer than blade shavingCleaning system is loud, have to make sure I'm leavingWhat I do like:SELF CLEANINGDoes a pretty decent job when you don't feel like being carefulCan buy it at Costco and return if you don't likeRefills are easy to findThe clean smell is very niceAsthetically pleasing shapeCarrying case is pretty goodTells you when you need to replace the blade"
5,Electric Razors,i have been using electric razors for many years starting with a Sunbeam. This razor provides the quickest and closest shave of any that I have used. I was somewhat concerned about the self cleaning system but I know find that is always pleasant to pick up the razor with a slightly lemon smell and always clean.
3,Worked for an year before the trimmer died and paint started peeling,"I used this shaver for about a year and few months, and it's great, when it worked! I get a much closer shave than I expected. I used to use blade, before using this one. Much comfortable than shaving with blade (on a daily basis).But after few months, silver paint just below the shaving heads started peeling off. I didn't care as it is just cosmetic. Then the trimmer stopped trimming and instead it pulls hair from the side burns and mustache.The cleaner works as advertised, but the blades don't keep the original performance after few months. So this message is for Braun (if they care to read) to keep up with the good shaver, but to make it work for few years at least.I would have given 4 1/2 stars, if it survived its anniversary without much trouble."
5,0 transfusions in 6 weeks !,"My blade launched a relentless and savage attack on me, the blood loss was almost fatal !!!!! I turned 50 last week. I do believe my skin has changed and I could no longer continue to use a blade. The 8595 took some getting use to and I have. The booklet stated that a two week period was needed for my skin to become acustome to the 8595, this was the case for me. I am now very satisfied with this purchase."
3,"Decent, but definitely not great","The reviews here might have given me false expectations, becuase everyone said it was so good. It's decent. The shave itself does seem a little closer than when I used my Gillette Fusion, but it also takes a whole lot longer to do the shave. I think my face may be a bit worse than others because I have hair grain that goes in many directions, and also because I have a bit of fat face (double chin). The neck definitely seems a whole lot harder to shave than my face. I found that using Lectric Shave helps a lot, more than the oil recommended in another post, and more than not doing anything.My biggest problem is that I keep cutting myself, especially my ears when shaving my sideburns area. I never cut myself with the Fusion, and definitely never my ears! I have no idea why that happens, I'm very careful, but it still happens and HURTS!"
3,Adequate but disappointing,"Purchased as a replacement for Norelco's supposedly high-end Smarttouch XL 9190XL, which did not shave closely enough for my tastes. The Braun is much heavier and as loud as an electric lawnmower. While the self-cleaning unit gets the job done it is large and bulky, too big to store on a bathroom countertop of limited size. The unit is not well-suited for travel. With the lower weight limits for checked baggage on all the airlines these days, ounces count when packing for a long trip and this model just weighs too much. Packing the cleaning unit for travel would be out of the question. The shaving closeness is only marginally better than the Norelco. I'm still searching for the holy Grail of electric razors."
2,Broke after a month,I recieved the Activator shaving system for Christmas. Now I know that all electric razors take a while to cut good but after a month it was still cutting horribly. I would spend 3 times as longs as I did with a regular razor just trying to shave my neck. For the hefty price tag it should cut like a dream but buyer beware. My Activator also broke after having it one month. I took great care of it always putting it back in the charger after I was done with it and cleaning it regularly. But now the LCD display will not work. At first it started flickering and now it won't display anything. It may be the right razor for some people but for more than $150 you'd better make sure you're one of those people or else you're going to end up with a broken razor that doesn't even cut.Braun was however very helpful when I called them and I was able to return it no sweat.
4,Almost there...,This shave is trully innovative. After using Panasonic shavers for several years I have to admit the difference is clear. Yes! The self cleaning mechanism is very convenient though noisy but accomodating.Obviously it doesn't chave as close as a blade but you can't expect that with an electric shaver. However it is preety smooth and best of all it leaves little or no irritation to my skin. For many years I'd been living with the humiliation of strangers walking upto me and asking why my neck was so red.Well! No more. The Braun Activator 8505 has ended my irritation problems.This is one of those products that you really just have to take it on a test run to appreciate how weel it works. I didn't give it a five star rating because it couldn't clear some hair on my neck and chin. Apart from that it works great.
2,Braun Activator Shaving System with LCD,"This is my second Braun shaver, but it doesn't really give close shave and the battery and the charging system doesn't work good. I went back to my old one."
4,Great but expensive,"WellPros:-It is a nice shaver. My first electric shaver was a braun - I bought in 1992 and I still have it. In comparison to my old shaver- this one does magic.-very close shave (as someone had said in a review- you shouldn't expect it to be as close as a razor- but close enough)-Excellent first pass effect and fast-Excellent charge-Like new after cleaningCons:-Expensive-After having this for over a year now, I'm beginning to feel the need for a new blade- I only shave once every 4-5 days.-The trimmer is difficult to clean- isn't cleaned by the solution.-Solution needed but in one year of use, I have only replaced it once with every 4-5 days of use.Recommend this Braun shaver- it is true it is expensive but I love it and I would always buy top of the line Braun shavers if I need in the future. I just do not like razors- they give me an itch after the shave and I don't know how they do that, but they make my hair grow thicker and faster.Good luck with your purchase"
5,Braun activator,"This was a gift to my husband,I shopped around and found the best deal here on Amazon. Wonderful shaver, he uses it everyday and will not use his old shavers or razor blades any longer. Great product. Thanks."
2,Good razor but with an annoying trimmer,"After reading 4-star reviews on Amazon.com website, I bought a Braun 8595 shaving system. As a razor, I like it over the Norelco rotary system I used earlier but I think this one has a design flaw. The trimmer is placed in a way that it touches the face from time to time when shaving it faced towards you. This is annoying. They should have placed it completely hidden without letting it touch the face when shaving. In addition to that problem, when extended, it is not long enough to trim too.Now I am thinking of getting a Noreclo or a Panasonic wet/dry shaving system. I wrote to Braun about this but they never responded to me."
1,Braun 8595 - Worst Shaver Ever,"I've struggled with this shaver for a year, am now giving up and going to Norelco.The shaver screens would break every other month. A little piece would come out that was almost invisible, producing a razor sharp edge in the screen. Not knowing this, I would then shave and cause cuts on my face. I've been through 6 of these screens despite trying to barely skim my face, resulting in a poor shave.At $45/screen + cutting block, I've spent way more than the shaver itself is worth.Braun = Fail"
2,Not worth the Money: AMAZON WILL NOT TAKE BACK,"I bought this to replace a low cost Remington, thinking that since it was so much more expensive that it would work better.The shave was okay, but not any better than the Remington.Certainly not worth the money.I'm also upset that Amazon will not take it back. It has to be returned to Braun, and I have to wait 6-8 weeks for a refund (per Braun)."
3,Very average shave,"I have over the years used several Braun shavers, panasonic, norelco, and remington. I think the accolades for this shaver must depend on what you expect. This produces an average shave, nothing more. If you look at the reviews for the model without the LCD, there are additional complaints in this area.I had to replace the cutter and foil after only 8 months. Do not expect to get 18 months as indicated by the manufacturer, it will not happen.The previous Synchro shaver I bought had the cleaner base break in a month.This model is definately far superior in that regard. I have had no problems.However, the shave itself is average. The new design is no improvement at all, and neck hairs are near impossible to shave.I think the Panasonic high speed shaver is superior to this, at about half the price.This product is way too expensive for its ability, and you keep paying and paying to use it."
4,The best so far,I have tried about 5 different electric razors all but this one have given me razor burn it must have something to do with the self cleaning and sharpening aspect of this razor which keeps it like new but its not perfect I would say it misses about 15 - 20 hairs overall I would give it a 8.5
4,Braun 8595 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System with LCD Display,It was good while it lasted. Started going through foils to quickly. Upgraded to the 7 series.
4,Works good,"My husbands had this a couple of years. It is now starting to fall apart, still shaves good though."
1,"Lasted 3 months, Service SUCKS!",Well I had mine for about 3 months when it started to get very loud. It started to vibrate & make a lot of noise. I called Braun & they told me I would have to bring it or ship it to one of their service centers. The closest one for me is an hour away. It is there now. The guy said it needs a part & its a common problem. Not too good for a shaver that was 160.00. I expected Braun to ship me another one but that did not happen...
5,Auto clean?,I've used other shavers but this is by far a much better shave than I have gotten with other brands. When you finish shaving put the shaver in it's cradel and at the push of a button this shaver selects how long to clean itself.At the same time it makes a decision to charge the battery or drain and recharge to extend the life of the battery.This is almost a completely self maintaining shaver.Wish I had a car like it.
2,Not a particularly close shave,"When this one wears out, I'll be going back to a Norelco. It's like a vacuum cleaner that requires you to go over the same piece of lint 15 times before picking it up."
4,"Great shaver, not so great cost","I switched back to electric after growing tired of showing up to work with a bloody, irritated face. While not as close as a blade, the 8595 provides a clean, comfortable and quick shave. The shaver is easy to hold and the cleaning system easy to understand.There are only two disadvantages of this shaver. First, the total cost of ownership is high, from the pricey shaver to the recurring cost of the non-refillable cleaning cartridges thought up by some MBA from hell. Second, the cleaning cycle seems needlessly loud and long. They need to take a clue from their cousins at Bosch on making quick and quiet equipment."
1,Time for a divorce,"Against my better judgement, I purchased this CD. I had heard some of these songs by other artists (Seamus Egan, Solas, Scatter the Mud), and wanted to hear additional interpretations. I figured that any band that has been around for 10 years must be doing someting right -- WRONG! Some anniversarys need not be celebrated. After 10 years, I think it's time to call the divorce lawyers. Stick to my original mentions -- Seamus Egan, Solas, Scatter. Get some Paperboys, Wolfstone, etc., if you enjoy this type of music. When the divorce is finalized, I hope the prenuptual agreement allows me to get my money back."
1,Horrid,"Boy, anyone can release a CD these days. 10TH ANNIVERSARY! How has anyone allowed this to go beyond 10 minutes?"
1,Covers of covers,"How sad that this band would release a ""new"" album performing covers of songs they previously have recorded, that, for the most part, are covers of older traditional tunes. The well of ideas apparently had evaporated. I hate the post ""Turn of the Wheel/Gravel Walk"" line-up. Where did they find the new guys? Are they students? A true downgrade for this band and a truly disappointing album."
2,"You only get 1 container, its plastic, & poor value","When purchasing this product, you need to be aware that you are only getting 1 refiller containers & not 2 as pictured. I bought this based on the picture, thinking I was getting both a salt & pepper refiller. Wrong! You only get 1.Also, this is simply an empty plastic milk/juice container with the spring loaded spout to screw on it. It is NOT worth the price this retailer wants!!A better choice is to either go thru one of the other Amazon vendors / external links listed on the product page, or find the spring loaded spout somewhere else & use an empy 1/2 gallon milk container."
5,Fools Errand- Exceptional!,"Fools Errand is an extraordinary account of failed attempts at ""nation building"" during the Clinton Administration. Gary Dempsey's expertise is evident as guides the reader through a maze of disturbingly flawed policy, astonishing bureaucracy, arrogance and stupidity that doomed nation building attempts to failure. Dempsey's analysis is brilliant, and he relates complex events with remarkable clarity."
2,Not a Low-Salt Cookbook,"This is a low-fat cookbook with the words ""low-fat"" crossed out and ""low-salt"" written in in crayon. I need a low-sodium diet because of inner ear problems and I was very disappointed with this book. Consider, for example, these two recipes: ""Chicken Enchiladas,"" p.112 and ""Spinach Lasagna,"" p 142. The former has 684 mg sodium per 2-enchilada serving and the latter has 594 mg per serving. Sorry, folks, but this ain't ""low-salt."" The book does have many low-salt recipes, but the real focus is low-fat. The authors use considerably more space discussing low-fat issues than low-sodium issues and precious little of the latter. Since you're not going to eat enchiladas and lasagna every night (I hope not!), the average amount of sodium intake over, say, a week would be lower using these recipes. This is fine if your focus is to take good care of your heart, but if you're like me and you're sensitive to bursts of sodium into your system, this book doesn't cut it."
1,These recipes are NOT low-sodium!,"I can't believe the American Heart Association produces this book. As a recently diagnosed heart patient, sodium is a primary concern of mine. This book's title is terribly misleading--just because you don't add salt, doesn't mean there's not sodium in other ingredients. The recipes in this book are not any better than most of the recipes in our Better Homes and Gardens cookbook. Just because the title says no salt, doesn't mean that these recipes will reduce your sodium intake. Browse and compare the recipes to those of other cookbooks with nutritional information. The AHA should be ashamed of itself. I recommend Gazzaniga's No-Salt, Lowest Sodium cookbook."
3,Camera lens hood,"I was a little disappointed with this one. It was a used one, and did not fit my lens. It was EF and I did not know that there were 2 types and I needed the EM hood. It would have cost me as much to return it as what I paid for it so I kept it and hopefully will find someone to buy it off me. I emailed the guy and he never returned my email, so I had no clue how to send it back. I will not buy from a private seller again. Cameta camera is the best to buy camera accessories from. Next time I will do a little more research before buying the first pop up on Amazon and think it will be the one to work."
4,carrie underwood's an 'angel',"Carrie underwood (winner of American Idol 2005) sang this song in the finals, which i think she won with,song first sung by guy sebastian winner of AI austraila, he sings it better, but she did it justice! shame its not on her album."
2,Take away the Hype and what do we have?,"Firstly, I think this song is terrible lyrically. Of course it would go to number 1 here in Australia, with all the hype and publicity surrounding Australian Idol, Guy Sebastian could of farted to a dance beat and that would of gone to number 1.Vocally Guy does have a pleasant enough voice to listen to, but don't waste your money on this single, there are definately better tracks on his Cd - Just as I am."
1,"CD of an old, scratchy recording","This is a CD of an old, scratchy recording. If you have antiquarian zeal and an interest in the history of Brahms performances you might like it. If you want sound quality, buy a more modern version."
5,Old School + New School = Win,"My old computer died. Well, the Hard Drive (HD) died. Too lazy to dig up old DELL/Windows discs. So, bought new (old school) IDE drive, got one of these cables, + Ubuntu OS (free alternative to Windows OS/95/98/Vista/7) and now I have a new computer for the price of a $20 HD and X dollar IDE cable. I can put the new/old computer in my kids room so they can learn from STARFALL.COM. that site is amazing. Made by teachers ""supposedly"", with apps available for purchase (which is why I said ""supposedly""), but nevertheless, the site is free and my kids are learning. They work good enough to buy. Don't toss old puters without at least trying to get a little more life out of them with products like this one. Cute $200 pink netbooks just aren't worth it. Get yourself a Kindle Fire if anything else."
3,QuickStart Guide_PDF with Acrobat,"This is a fine, basic starter book for introduction to Adobe Acrobat 5 PDFs. But if you are searching for anything more than the basics, be prepared to buy an additional, more-in-depth guide, in the way of follow up. At several locations within this book, the author states, ""... [a particular subject] is beyond the scope of this book."" But this is true of most of the QuickStart guides. They are *perfect* for introduction to the concepts and basic use of platforms or software - and accomplish the task admirably well. But if you need guidance with the use of JavaScript, etc., in Acrobat, look elsewhere."
2,Under Developed Romance,"Frankly, I did not care for any of the characters. Maybe I cared for the stable boy because of his resemblance to Wesley from the movie Princess Bride. Other than that, the heroine has no saving grace except for her healing power. The hero, Darton, sinks so far into the background, you forget that this book is a romance novel. The plot line is the filled with rape and violence against women, which is an important issue, but is not handled well at all. Skip this one."
3,Keyboard gets stuck,"I love this tiny little machine. Overall, it is nice. But the keys on the keyboard gets stuck. A big no no..."
3,"great, but....","Wonderful little machine, in general I love it. Unfortunately, inexplicably, there is no video out port. One of my intended uses was to use it as a portable dvd player. No DICE. You can hook it to a monitor but not a TV. My laptop from 1998 has video out, but not this one.I may have to return it, and get the little fujitsu, because of the lack of a feature that probably would cost 25 cents to add. =( I would prefer to have the sony."
3,Devastingly good at times but marred byan irritating middle,"Beyond Forever is a book that held much promise. The beginning and the end of the book are its best sections because the characters are fun, charming and heartwarming. But, sadly, the book wasted far too much of it's middle with the characters caught in a seemingly endless cycle of annoying ""I hate you but, darn it, my traitorous body still wants you oh-so-bad"" behavior. As a result, what could have been an exceptional read turned out to be yet another average one. Still, if you love time travel, surly, sexy Scottish heroes, believe in soul-mates and don't have a problem with the type of relationship that I've described above you may love this one."
5,"If you like time travel novels, you have to have this one!","I loved this book! I agree with another reviewer in saying that Ms. Dier just goes right into the plot, with Julia meeting Gavin's ghost in the opening chapter. From there, the author takes you on an incredible ride. I couldn't put it down. From start to finish (and everything in between), the reader is captivated. I would recommend this to anyone!"
4,Wonderful Read,The heroine was asked by his ghost to go back in time and save his son's life. She had obligations and didn't want to which made for a slow start but then it was a couldn't-put-down read for me. Wonderful characters.
5,I really liked this book,Really enjoyed this timeswept storyline. It was not the most captivating book I have read but I still think it is a five star book.
1,"repetitive, with no useful information","After reading this book, I know nothing new about pornography that I didn't know before. My boyfriend and I are very open about sex, porn and adult entertainment. This book talks about Porn and how to excercise your first amendment rights-WOW! (brain overload)!!! It does nothing to tell about the experiences, accomplishments or long-term benefits of pornography. It does nothing to dispel the myths, of all porn stars degrading themselves or contracting diseases. It does nothing to educate someone from the outside who is looking in. The book is totally boring and lacks alot of information that people might be curious about."
1,Just worthless!!!,Not worth a single penny. This is a tiny map (don't let the picture fool you). It has no added value. A free map from a car rental (any) is incomparably better (useful vs. useless). This is not of any help even if one wants to look at major highways.There was no zero star so had to put one.
5,Water Dance is a beautiful way to learn,"Thomas Locker's beautiful oil paintings make ""Water Dance"" a work of art and a wonderful way for kids to learn about the water cycle.I decided to see what's out there for kids about water and began with ""Water Dance,"" ""Where the River Begins,"" and ""Cloud Dance,"" all by Locker. I fell in love with his art and . . . also bought ""Sky Tree"" and several others.I just published a review of approximately 20 kids water books titled ""Teaching Children about the Hydrologic Cycle."" To read, go to www.ndwc.wvu.edu and click on the current issue of ""On Tap,"" a magazine about drinking water in small communities."
4,Poetry and science at once,"It can be hard to write an educational picture book. You don't have any plot (or you DO and it feels tacked on and weird), and it may be a subject - like the water cycle - that seems to go best with dry, flat, boring diagrams with arrows on them.The author has completely eschewed the normal approach to go with beautiful, evocative paintings and poetry.It's not as informative, maybe, as an early science reader approach, but for an introduction to the subject or a younger child - or just for having around the house! - I think this is the better option. So get one standard, run of the mill book on the water cycle, but be SURE to get this one as well. You won't regret it."
3,Awesome Artist,"This is a fantastic CD. Chuck and Alex land a great combo with inovation, technique, skill and anointing. Just waiting for the next one!"
1,Doesn't work with modern operating systems,"From Encore's web site:Unfortunately, our program is not compatable with Microsoft Service Pack 1 for Windows XP and Service Pack 4 for Windows 2000. Currently there is no fix for this sound issue other than uninstalling the associated service pack. We DO NOT recommend this as it may remove some functionality from other programs you have installed on your system. This is however a known workaround. We apologize for any inconvience this has caused."
5,Must for Sherlock Holmes Fans,All of the first part of the novels and short stories. Great compact size and all of the great stories. The second volume has the remaining stories.
4,great,I like the Sherlock Holmes types of mysteries. He is the master of discovery. I liked it a lot. Great..
5,Elementary!,I am very happy to have this on my shelf. It's a tremendous find and picking it up to read a case or two has been very delightful. Doyle's characters have a life all their own that you're sure are going on without you when you're not reading. ;-)
5,Very fun book to read,This is book a great compile of stories put into wonderful order. I have learned to love both of the main character in this series and look forward to moving onto Part 2.
4,Not bad!,"This solder and flux kit was a life saver, and Amazon's overnight shipping even more so. I was in the position where due to the crazy weather I couldn't make it to the store, however right on time the UPS truck came to my front door bearing overnight gifts from Amazon.The flux is liquid. Not a paste or gel like some, but as viscous as water. Just be forewarned. I didn't read the description well enough and dumped a ton out by accident upon first usage. That's my fault however, not the manufacturer. The solder seems of good quality. Also, if you get this stuff on your hands, WASH THEM IMMEDIATELY. I had the misfortune of biting my nails after having spilled some of this stuff, and due to the hydrochloric acid content was left with a terrible taste in my mouth and a mild stomach ache. (I'm sounding way clumsier than I really am here..)Either way, it works and the flux goes a long way! Good value, recommended!"
4,Silver Solder,The product was as described and received in a timely fashion. The solder was an improved option over normal solder for a stronger bond and ease of use. I would recommend it to others.
2,not impressed yet,"I bought this heater today to supplement my main central electric heat because it got too cold in the house having a small baby. i plugged it in, cranked it on high for about an hour and it is still giving off the most awful smell ever. i thought it might go away after about 30 minutes, but it is still going. i had to take it out of the baby's room because i didnt want her to smell the nasty fumes. Needless to say, I am going to give it a little time because it seems to get pretty warm."
4,Quiet Heat,"I have the non-digital control version of this heater that I purchased from a big-box home improvement store two years ago to take the chill off in my detached one-car garage, and it works quite well. The fan-less radiant design is nice because it is so quiet and doesn't blow dust and papers around. It takes a few minutes to get up to temperature, but works fine for my purposes. I wouldn't try to heat a large or uninsulated area with it, but for small areas or supplemental heat without a fan, it's great."
4,The best I've found so far. Litte bit of buzzing electric noise....,"Quiet, but not that quiet! I try to use it in the bedroom with medium setting but the heater has a steady buzzing noise. It is not that loud at all but I can hear it. I am still looking for the ""perfect"" one."
5,Good Ole Gospel Music,"Pefect blend of old school down home gospel with a bit of modernization to keep it fresh and current. Yes, Yes Lord!"
5,10 + STARS,"""Family"" is one of many must reads by J. California Cooper Everything she writes is fabulous...I own all of her books. I hope she writes more."
5,This book was an excellent read! I highly reccommend it.,"Ths was an excellent story, that kept me turning the pages. I finished this book in one sitting!!"
2,Book Condition,"The seller had mentioned that the book was slightly used, but this book had way too much writing in it."
4,Unique narration and empowering ending.....,"This was a page-turner. Some books we must almost force ourselves to finish but this story is very compelling. When I first began reading, I had to do so very slowly so that I could understand what was happening. The reason was because the narrator of this book is herself a slave from the mid-1800's and therefore speaks with the slang and southern accent of that time. Once I got used to that I liked it because it made the story feel more authentic. I felt that it again reminds us of how inhumane slavery was and still is; that we as people must never allow for it to reoccur in todays world or future though, sadly, it still exists out there in other countries and forms. The ending was so glorious and made me feel wonderful for the characters. It is in my opinion, a great book that everyone could benefit from reading but you may have to be in the mood for it since some of it's content is more than disheartening"
4,Family book,"It was little bit late delivery, but i did not needed this book for college right away. But the book was awesome it was clean no damages no writing it was like brand new."
5,Ms. Cooper is the BEST African American Female Writer,"Ms. Cooper's books are so heartfelt. Not only are they entertaining, but they are educational. To sum the feelings I have for this OUTSTANDING, CREATIVE, WONDERFUL author would be.EXCELLANT"
1,Piece of junk! Avoid!!,"This thing has the worst drivers ever. I could not get it to work, the included software is horrible garbage. I am taking it to the garage and putting it out of its misery with a sledgehammer, as it will never touch any of my PCs ever again."
1,This book is a waste of time!,"This book is not written well, the author's jibberish english makes the book unreadable.Mostly the author talks about his sisters experiance and that how she got pregnant in a Taliban prison camp."
1,Desperate move by a desperate unknown,"This piece, whose author is most likely not a Hazara, seems like it is a desperate means toward some type of personal financial gain. Unfortunately, some people have spent their well earned money on this waste and I'm sorry for their loss. The Hazara people are the proven existence of Afghanistan; they could never be wiped out just by a cheap, worthless, and baseless accusation. This accusation suits only those with a few coins in their pockets, those who try to tell a story from their imagination, or those who try to serve their masters better. I have spent over seventeen years studying the Hazaras; unfortunately this was the cruelest attempt by anyone, who I'm most certainly sure is not Hazara, to blacken the character of a proud Hazara to date. I am appalled of what I have read and disturbed by the fact that something like this is valued for printing purposes or even considered as a sort of reference."
1,Lack of proper resources. Very unfactual book,This book is basically written by an ethnic minority of afghanistan who obviously has a severe grudge over Afghan history. It is like having the African AMerican defaming the leaders of the constitution or Washington or Lincoln because they were white and a representative of white and not based on their deeds. This book is written in anger and it should not be used as resource material for any academic scholarship because of its subjectiveness and inaccuracies.
3,Bad at first- Good at last!,"This game does suck in the beginning, but doesn't when you get all the characters and stages. This game is nothing like Super Smash Brothers Meele, because you hardly have any room to run and when a character punches you, you lose the weapon! How disapointing! The game is super easy and is more designed for children. I unlocked every character and stage within about 3 hours! This game is a total iffy, so I am just warning adults not to buy this item if you are an expert player ( Never mind the Teen rating, there is hardly any rough violence in it!) but for kids, this is an excellent game."
3,Nice ... If it worked.,I played the game with my kids. It's simple enough to let them play and have fun.The problem lies in the fact that it CRASHES after EACH LEVEL!Not worth buying an un-finished game.
4,Astrology of Fate--Greene's magnum opus?,"I have read this book through once and then referred back to it many, many times over the years. This book may be Liz's magnum opus. It really does bring together in one book many of Greene's main ideas as far as astrology is concerned. It is very philopsophical however and would not be a book for the beginning student, nor the student wishing to get specific info on certain astrological principles. It is very much a Ninth House book! I found it fascinating reading, though challenging. And I marveled at Liz's depth of knowledge and insight into the human condition. Her analysis of the 12 Zodiacal Signs as they relate to Greco-Roman mythology was really neat. The section on Pluto as an integral indicator of Fate was especially well done. All in all a very fine work!"
2,Biorb was a bust,"Baby Biorb was so cool looking and low-maintenance, I thought I would love it. The problem: The pump is noisy -- it makes more noise than than both the motor on my refrigerator or my dishwasher when it is running (despite the label on the pump that says it is ""silent."") Biorb's ""customer service"" was completely unhelpful -- both my calls and email went unreturned. After several tries, I returned the Biorb."
2,Returned.,"We bought the biorb from petsmart because it looked simple and modern (not to mention the good reviews). We started setting it up and found out that the air pump has to be placed above the waterline. This takes away from the streamline feeling we were looking for. Are we supposed to nail the air pump to wall? I tried to find pictures of other biorbs and it didn't look like anyone followed this rule. I was annoyed and returned it the next day, dissatisfied."
5,Happy with our Baby Biorb,We really like our Baby Biorb tank. It's great looking and easy to care for. Just follow the instructions and all is easy and fine.
2,Not for very small fish!!!,"We originally bought this aquarium for a betta. He seemed to do okay in it, although we lost him after about 9 months and we're still not sure why. But we decided to replace him with six neon tetras and in about a week we lost two of them when they got sucked into the filtration system. It was awful and a torturous death for those fish.We just switched to a Marineland integrated aquarium system Eclipse Hex 5 (5 gallon tank) and so far it seems like it will be much better for the tetras. Its also quieter and easier to keep to clean. The biorb was my first tank, so I had no idea that it was more difficult than other tanks to maintain."
3,Misleading,"I bought this tank at a great deal and was very pleased with how it functioned not to mention its beautiful appearance. After some research however, I found that, even though it is advertised as a ""the new goldfish bowl"" it is entirely too small for even one fancy goldfish. Not only do I have to change the water everyother day, but my poor goldfish will need an upgrade soon.So yeah, do your research before you buy (unlike me) Any SINGLE goldfish needs a 16 gallon tank minimum, 20 being the ideal. This is due to their waste production and scale (ALL goldfish grow up to 6-8 inches) The saying that they grow to the size of the bowl is a myth. Your fish will merely suffer from stunted growth and die very prematurely.This bowl is only sutable for guppies or minnows- don't be fooled by the pictures!!!!!!"
5,Great small aquarium!,"The 4 gallon baby biorb aquarium is a great desktop aquarium. I bought it for my daughter's room and she loves it. The water remains clear longer; less cleaning time. Plus, it looks really nice next to her bed. She has the silver rim one but can buy a different color rim if she so chooses later on. Overall a great purchase for her 6 guppies."
4,Useful home for pet fish,"Bought this as a gift for a friend. She found the Biorb handy for a first-time pet-keeper. The Biorb can be kept easily on a computer desk. The installation was very easy. The pump, gravel and other accessories that came along were good. A useful thing would be to buy the Biorb cleaner pump and an extra pack of gravel along with this.I would have preferred to get her a 16 gallon one instead of a 8-gallon. The 8-gallon Biorb now houses 4 neon tetras and 2 guppy fish. If you are planning to house a few gold fishes I would suggest going for the bigger version.I would not suggest the Biorb if you are planning to have salt-water fishes."
1,"Bad for the fish, especially betas","I actually heard somewhere (can't remember) that the circular shape stops enough oxygen from being incorporated into the water, basically suffocating the fish. I had a beta for a year until I bought her a circular tank, she lived for a while longer but one day I just found her floating. So I researched why she would have and that's the answer I got, circular tanks are bad for the fish."
1,Leaking 6 weeks in,"We were initially disappointed at the view of the top of this tank which really detracts from the look of the tank, which was a big selling point for us. The cords coming out of it are unsightly. But NOW we are really mad because this tank is leaking after running it for only 6 weeks! The company hasn't returned my phone call or email either so I am afraid we are stuck!! I recommend looking for something more stable!"
1,I just looks nice,"I purchased this product and I wished I hadn't.The air pump is unbearably noisy, so I purchased a new one from Reef One, but they sent me another jet engine.The filter system is so poor, that my Platys died, and my male Beta, who was the next inhabitant after the Platys, contracted fin rot. All these conditions are attributable to having to completely replace the filter which disturbs the bacteria in the tank.In addition, the ceramic media is very sharp and jagged and will tear fins of fish and scratch acrylic.This tank just looks nice, but it isn't conducive for life, the replacement filters are way too expensive, and the air pump is deafening."
3,Not Suitable for Goldfish,"After a great deal of research, it became clear that this aquarium, despite the photos, is not sufficiently large to sustain goldfish in a healthy environment. This was a major disappointment and I returned the aquarium as a result. For other smaller fish which put less demands on their environment, it would be a stylish living environment."
2,owner for over a year,these tanks are difficult to clean.you need a heater and there's no way to put one in without changing the appearance of the tank.there should have been a heater built into the base.it also scratches easy.
5,More Than Just A Cookbook,"The author is so clearly an expert in her field for the way she explains and clarifies her information. She helps you understand the ingredients in the recipes and the need for wholewheat pastry flour, natural sweeteners instead of refined sugar, dairy and its alternatives. I try to live dairy free and have used her information when explaining to friends my lifestyle. The recipes are fabulous. The Apple Crisp was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner. No one knew there wasn't sugar, eggs, and bleached flour in the dessert they raved about! Should be on the bookshelves of bakers who care about there family's health but want to create great desserts."
2,sweet & natural - disappointing,"i bought this book with high hopes as we are making the switch to whole foods cooking/baking but do enjoy our desserts. unfortunately, i will have to keep looking - this is not it. the author seems more interested in presentation than taste. i spent $7 for tofu for the lemon cake and we didn't care for it at all - we threw it away. i followed the recipe to the letter and thought there were too many steps not to mention the taste was bland and the cake didn't keep well. i just made the cranberry bread again following the recipe to the letter and was very disappointed in the results. it didn't raise over 1 1/2 inches with 2 tsp. of the aluminum free baking powder plus baking soda!! i realize whole foods cooking/baking is different and the results may be somewhat different but i was not prepared for that much difference."
3,Choc. Chip Cookies Could Be Better,"We made the Chocolate Chip Cookies from p. 221, which are vegan. They had a funny taste from the brown rice syrup (sort of sour after) and the use of water. They didn't have enough fat, or flavor for me. There are no eggs or milk or butter in this recipe, just oil, and the chocolate chips are malt sweetened. I applaud her efforts, and will try some others in this book. Desserts that are fairly healthy are a worthy pursuit. And many sound delicious."
1,pretty bad,"This book have recieved numerous positive reviews, but I just don't see it - and I'm not usually overly critical of books. It started ok, if somewhat lacking in depth and description, but by the time the book came to Kicsi's incarceration in the concentration camps the writing had become so juvenile, Spartan, and threadbare that I couldn't read it. The characters began to talk in cliches and no one acted realistically given the situation. The holocaust, a horrific part of history, was treated in such a dismissive manner that it was almost offensive. I admit that at this point I gave up, so as for the rest of the plot I cannot say. The premise is quite interesting, and in the hands of a more talented author I think it would be a very interesting book, but don't waste your time on this one in its present state."
4,safety concern,My son started playing with this toy when he was six months old and absolutely loved it and still likes it. It helped motivate him to crawl but this toy should be a playpen toy (I had hardwood floors) or you should not allow your child to play with it unless you are right there because (as another review said) my son will also reach his arms out and the toy flips up and hits him in the face. This toy may be much better on carpet but probably won't slide as well. Great toy...with close supervision.
4,Entertaining for little ones.,"I received this as a shower gift and broke it out of the packaging when my daughter was 6 months old and sitting on her own. I put it in front of her and she loves to play with the ""shifter"" and honk the horn - she knows that it will make noise and light up. I think that she will continue to enjoy it as she begins crawling. Only downfall - the noise can become annoying after a little while but as long as the baby is entertained I am happy!"
4,WATCH YOUR CRAWLERS,"I KNOW THIS TOY IS MADE TO HELP YOUR LITTLE ONE LEARN TO CRAWL BUT, PLEASE WATCH THEM VERY CAREFULLY. MY LITTLE GUY IS 6 MONTHS & CRAWLING GREAT BUT SOMETIMES AS HE PUSHES THIS TOY OUT TO ARMS LENGTH HOLDING THE TOP BAR IT FLIPS UP FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND HITS HIM HARD RIGHT IN THE FACE!!! IT WAS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TOYS WHEN I BOUGHT IT BEFORE HE WAS MOBILE BECAUSE THE NOISES & SOUNDS IT MADE. BUT NOW I DON'T LET HIM PLAY WITH IT ANYMORE SINCE IT HAS HAPPEND MORE THAN 1 TIME."
2,waste of money,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 11 months old. My because he liked his other toys better, but he doesn't give this one any attention at all. The crank is hard for him to turn and the musical tune doesn't keep his attention. I love this brand but this isn't one of their best toys."
1,what a lame toy,"i bought this toy about a month ago for my 8 month old son. it seemed like a great toy, since he was starting to crawl. plus he seemed to enjoy the sounds and the music it plays at the store. but ever since i took it out of the package he has played with it once, it's just like every other playzone toy fisher price makes.besides that, the honking noises and the music it plays are really annoying. don't waste your money. trust me"
4,"Good, but very specialized reference","While this is an excellent study of Alabama's lost towns of old, I recommend it only for the most die-hard Alabama student/historian. The listings are well-presented and there is much esoteric historical information contained within the covers, but the average seeker of Alabama history tidbits should look for a more general reference.A decent general and relatively recent Alabama history book is ""Alabama The History of a Deep South State"" (currently available from Amazon & other sources). Although I don't completely agree with a few of the subjective opinions/views expressed in this publication, I certainly consider it the best history of Alabama to have been published in the last 50 years and do indeed recommend it!"
3,Dead Towns of Alabama - a practical review,"An easy to read reference guide to the Ghost Towns of Alabama. Many of the towns are old Indian towns that only exist in writings of the early explorers, which makes them more interesting, yet harder to find. The details are excellent, and much research has been done to cre3ate this wonderfully helpful guide to exploring Alabama's Ghost Town. So much so we use it as primary reference for the Alabama Ghost-Town Project:[...]"
2,"Too confining, has a metal flange","Too confining, has a metal flange around the mesh grill cover that attatches to a raised metal inner flange that's raised 3/4 "" from the speaker, like a tunnel. Hard to tell by the picture."
2,Disappointed that the company would not allow a return,I was disappointed that the company would not allow me to return the memory I bought. I was unable to use it with my computer.
5,Ten Little aterpillars,"Being a teacher I had not seen this book by Bill Martin. It is great, young children love his patterns and the illustrations are colorful but then it is Lois Ehlert . It is a wonderful precursor for young children to begin reading. Bought it for my granddaughter and after two readings she was reading it to her little brother. He loves looking at the pictures and being 13 months old, he babbles as he looks at it. This is how reading begins, my friends."
2,Complete seasons found!,"For all of those who would like to see complete seasons of Avonlea, I have found them! Released through Sullivan Entertainment, you can go to www.sullivanboutique.com and purchase the first three complete seasons of Road to Avonlea on dvd. Not only are all of the episodes included, there are also bonus features, such as bios and behind the scenes. I have also found these dvds on ebay, where you might be able to purchase them for less. Hope this has been helpful!"
4,Full Season Sets (Season 1 and 2) are Available,"After opening up the box, I was so disappointed to find that only eight episodes were listed on the back. I don't what I had been thinking, but had been under the flase impression that I had ordered a complete season set.However, if you go to amazon.ca (Canada) you will find much more to choose from on this wonderful series!"
2,Poor Video Quality,"I absolutely love the Avonlea series that was on the Disney Channel. I was very excited to learn that Disney was releasing the series in a complete season format. Although the package does not indicate that it is closed captioned it is. That was a must for me as I am deaf. Unfortunately, the video quality is very poor and a LOT of editing was done in most of the episodes. I would consider purchasing from Sullivan Entertainment, but their discs do not have closed captioning or even subtitles. If you don't mind the editing, poor video quality or the sometimes out of sync audio, then you would like it very much."
3,Kind of boring period kids show,"A late 19th century Canada comes to life in this TV series as a moviein two episodes. Although it has the Disney ""heart warming"" formula down pat,it is mostly pretty boring, family and chick flick like.I didn't like it at all."
4,nice but I needed to shim it up,"Great wheat grass juicer after I did an improvement on it. When I first tryed it out, it was horrible. The wheat grass came out way too wet.Then I noticed the auger had too much play in it to work properly. So I shimmedit up with a nylon washer and then it worked perfectly. Simple fix but then again I needed to work on it. Typical Taiwan quality issue. Happens everytime I get something made in Taiwan or china I have to do something to make it work. Thats why I will only give it 4 stars. Another small problem is the crank bar is way too loose. They should have made tighter tolerances to the mount, its very loose. Taiwan should take notes from the West Germans when it comes to quality. Nothing you can do about that however. I did a side by side comparison of the Health juicer and they both produce about the same amount of juice. Out of the box the Healthy juicer won However, Now after the modication The Hurricane wins the contest."
2,Wheatgrass juicer,"Hurricane Stainless Steel Manual Wheatgrass Juicer- Hand Crank Juice Extractor for Wheat Grass & Barley Grass JuicingWe were really excited when we first got this product. However, after about a week it just didn't seem to work right, if it ever did. Out of an entire tray of wheatgrass i get about a half a shot, it should be about, from what i've read, two shots a tray. Its not. The machine is incredibly inefficient, and i wish i hadn't purchased it."
5,easy to clean and set up,I recommend this since it works very well for a manual juicer in its price range. It is very easy to use and was packaged very well from its plant. I often throw pieces of apple or grapefruit into it to add volume and flavor to the wheatgrass shot and it gets a lot of juice from these fruits. It is easy to clean and the parts seem to be very sturdy.
5,Awesome quality for the price,"Having not been in the market for a manual juicer before, I was initially concerned about the price. After getting this juicer, I am glad I spent the money and it was worth every penny! The juicer is top notch quality throughout. All heavy duty and high quality stainless steel parts. Cleanup was a breeze and juicing wheatgrass was near effortless. After having this item in my hands and using it, I would have gladly paid more."
4,Juicer is slow but efficient,"I purchased this item for juicing certain herbs that don't work well in electronic juice extractors, especially cleavers (Galium) which has been locally abundant. It is hard work and takes a while before the juice starts to flow, but once flowing it works quite well. It should also be good for nettles. I haven't tied it on wheatgrass"
3,Meh...,"The dvds came early and unscathed (from the outside), however once I viewed them, dvds 3-5 skipped in a couple scenes on each dvd. Not wanting to hafta take them to the post office, pay shipping to return them and get them back, I used a ""Disk Doctor"" device on them to see if it would solve the problem, still waiting to watch them agin."
2,defective,I purchased the box set and reconstruction. the 3rd season and 5th season disk and reconstruction would not play in my dvd player or eather of my two computers. what would happen is the movie on the 3 disks would stop playing about half way threw and start pixelateing and finaly stop playing all together. so i sent it back to Amazon and they sent me a new box set and reconstruction. the same thing happened again where the 3rd 5th and reconstruction disks wouldn't play. im wondering if its a common defect. while i love red vs blue and really want the box set i think there might be a common problem with the way they pressed the disks and while i want to send this box set back and replace it im not sure that the ones i buy will be any better.
1,A thinner box set,"I just received this, and it does not look anything like the photos above, the item they sent me was 2 discs, first disc has season 1-3, 2nd disc has season 4-5 plus bonuses and it does not say the complete series, it says the first five seasons, so for the price, I'm feeling kinda ripped off, thinking of sending it back, they should send what they pictured there and not something else, the box set I have sells for under $50, the one pictured above sells for about$100, plus it didn't come with a reciept or any thing."
5,Excellent!,"This show is perfect. And the boxset was not scratched at all. And Burnie Burns did a good job as Church. The last episode has a lot of endings. From episode one, to episode one-hundred. Excellent series."
5,Best Webshow Ever,Red Vs. Blue is one of the kost original and funny shows to come out in a long time. The five seasons it ran left me craving for more webisodes.
4,Cambridge Companion to Lacan,This book provides a good series of articles on Lacan and his work. The one by Shepherdson is especially good.
4,best gba game,this is my favorite army men game for gba.And it is my favorite game for gba!I like it when you use the flamethrower on people and they melt.And all the weapons in the game are awesome!the game gets a little hard on level 2 but when you get really good at it its not that hard. ive beat the game already.the multiplayer is really fun.i I play it with my next door neighbor.i think its really fun when you get to use jeeps and tanks. the reason i only gave it four stars is because the graphics arent as good as something like mario kart and the people are kinda hard to see because their so small.anyway i reccomend this game to anyone who likes games with guns in it or someone who liked army men operation green.
5,"Excellent Deal, good movies","This isn't a review of the three movies in this set, but it is a review of the set itself: excellent (not totally pristine, but regular dvd quality) prints of all 3 movies; no ""frills"" (no subtitles/captioning) but if you're looking for 3 decent movies (none are great, but all are entertaining) for CHEEEEEP look no further. Not some schlocky package where some huckster transferred old VHS onto dvd (we've all see that!), but very nice treatments. All widescreen, and, yes, this is the version of ""Lifeforce"" that is apparently extended, as it is quite close to 2 hours long (I think 1hr 56 min.?). Don't hesitate because of the price...nothing at all wrong with these versions of these films. ONE note: I haven't seen any other dvd version of ""Burnt Offerings"", but this showed some fuzzy light saturation moments, which very well could have been intentional in the original film, as they seemed to fit ""artistically""."
2,Very nice & boring - for inexperienced only,"I accidentently ordered this instead of the Vol 2 Tantra disc. I learned nothing. Basically be more considerate, more foreplay. There are small little skits between couples kissing/touching where a male announceer talked nicely over it giving tips so you couldn't hear much of the actors. There was no real sex (obviously) & though showed nudity of the women, it only showed one frontal nudity once of a guy & he was not even turned on.In betweeen each skit was Dr. Ruth talking to three couples in a living room setting about sex & problems & issues such as lack of foreplay, condoms, etc. ""Doesn't the drive to her house count as foreplay?""Men might like the strip tease from a blond in the first skit or the role-playing one also."
2,Not good enough,"These really have no bass and very light midrange, can't handle much volume. They sound bad at all volumes, but sound really terrible as the volume gets loud.They sound pretty much like average built-in laptop speakers SHOULD sound. If you have EXCEPTIONALLY crappy built-in laptop speakers, like I do, these will improve things to where it sounds like just normally crappy laptop speakers.Waste of money, really. Wish I hadn't bought them. Can't recommend them."
2,USBeware,"When I tried the Kensington speakers on my new Toshiba laptop,I found the sound quality poor with the sound cutting out. I hooked them into an older Compaq laptop and they worked fine. Iended up buying portable speakers from Sharper Image that are powered by USB, but the sound comes through the earphone jack--and they work great with deep, rich sound. USB sound is undependable, unless you already know that your computer puts out good sound this way."
2,you get what you pay for,"Tinny sound and not much of it, pretty crappy overall, but for the price I'm not sure what more I should have expected."
1,NOT WORTH IT,I just bought these speakers with the hope that it would boost the sound/volume of my laptop but it produces the same if not a lower volume than that of the built-in speakers and the volume control level is very limited.It does not deliver and is not worth the price and I am only writing this so that someone else does not make the same mistake I did.
2,Not very pleased!!,"The sound out of these wasn't a whole lot better than what my laptop was already putting out. I ended up buying Logitech's USB speakers, and they are VERY good. I would suggest another product over the Kensington speakers."
1,Piece of Junk,This product is similar in quality to the free AM/FM radios that you often get as promotional gadgets. It is not even worth $1.00. My laptop PC is far superior in tone. Actually there is no comparison. The product was returned thanks to a very customer oriented distributor.
2,Convenient but underpowered,"I recently purchased the Kensington 33130 laptop speaker as a gift for one of my daughters. They work well enough and are convenient to use and store, but no one should confuse this tiny speaker set with the real thing. The sound level is not very impressive and they sound tinny. If you want more than the simplest solution, go for something with a little more oomph."
1,Smells BAD!,"I bought this as a present for a friend who loves the scent of Heliotrope, but this smells nothing like that! My friend described it best when she said it smells like bug spray without the added bug repelling benefit."
3,CHIPPING!!!???,"I loved the product when I first got it, it was very attractive and sleek but as soon as the second use it started to chip and by the third usage almost all the black coating came off!?!?! I really had high expectations but this was a let down. Even though it looks great you'll regret buying this once it chips."
3,Really poor quality and don't deserve your money,"i go this flat iorn 8 months ago,it heats up quickly and have diffrent heat settings but the worest part ,its started peeling off the tourmaline coat or what ever the name of its sperficial coat of the part that heats up. so now i can see the silver aluminum or what ever the material below the black coat. i am not sure if this is harmful or not to my hair but it is increasing in peeling . i feel the quality is not good enough."
2,Coating flakes off,"Let me set this straight: this iron does straighten hair, but doesn't last long. The coating of the iron (black) flakes off after a couple weeks and then doesn't work as well. It will work, but does a far worse job than when it was new. Invest in a better one, that's why I'm on here now."
3,Not sure,"When I first got this straightener I loved it. I had it a couple of months, but something is wrong... After it heats up the handle to hold the straightener gets so hot I can barely touch it. It was a GREAT item minus this one problem. The temp stayed the correct temp throughtout the entire process and I have alot of hair. I might buy another one but if I have to keep buying it over and over then I might as well invest in a chi."
1,"Worked Great, a few times...","I don't use a flat iron often, so didn't want to spend much on one. This iron worked great about 5 times, now it doesn't heat at all. The indicator light comes on, but no heat. The black coating also began flaking off after about 2 uses."
3,Depends on your hair texture...,"I bought this product because the specifications stated that the temperature goes to 425 degrees. When I opened the box, the cardboard insert stated that the temperature goes to 375 degrees...50 degrees less than what I was expecting. Despite the difference in degrees, I opened the product and attempted to straighten my hair anyways. Although it did straighten my hair, I didn't get the results I get with my Revlon flat iron. I straightened my god-daughter's hair (whose hair is 30 times less coarse than mines) and got somewhat good results. I think I might give the Andis another try before retiring it to my god-daughter. So far, I am not too impressed with the results. I would say I am neutral with the way this product performs!"
2,Not true!,This does NOT heat up in 30 seconds as advertised. The instructions say the the lights indicate when the iron is heating and is fully heated and the light just keeps blinking no matter how long it's on!!! There's no real way to know it's heated to the correct temp unless you wait a long time!
1,You get what you pay for,"This purchase was a huge disappointment. I just got this straightener less than a week ago, and already, the black paint or whatever it is on the plates have already begun to chip off. I've considered returning it, but would be at a loss for the shipping since this thing is only 20 bucks. Regardless, I would not recommend this product to anyone since it could not even hold up for a week. I am so disappointed. What a waste of money."
2,Not good quality,"I bought this flat iron knowing that I wouldn't be getting the ""best"" quality since I was only paying $19.99, but I've only had it for about 2 1/2 weeks (using it once a day) and the coating on the plates has already begun to chip off. Not good! It's done a good job of straightening my hair, but given its quality issues, I can't recommend it."
2,Died on the third day!,"I had got this in the mail, and i used it for the first three days, and it was great! Then on the fourth day it took an hour to heat up and even then it wasn't full heat. I had to use my sisters. Take my advice, don't buy this. If you really want to get a good straightener, go and buy a conair or revlon."
1,Is the worst flat iron I ever seen,I have purchased 3 flat iron in amazon and never knew that something could happen soThe first time I used the ceramic clamp flat iron hair the plates is broke. Was Painting !!!!!Soon publishes photos of the alleged ceramicsIn this moment I wanted in the USA for a lawyer to sue this company by deceitful and bad. I have no money to pay back the plate to use it prefer sue andis
5,Read Traplines Now,"Traplines is an excellent book. Eden Robinson should write more, because her ability to find a correct treatment for a character or subject is amazing. If you are smart, you will like this book."
4,Question about size,"Hi can someone tell me the exact internal diameter of this speaker cover? I need to cover a speaker with an external diameter of 6 3/8"". thanks"
5,Solid construction,"These are built out of some sturdy steel. The top snaps onto the bottom very tightly, so I cut a notch in the bottom like many others. One thing I did notice is that the spot welds between the mesh and the ring are not as beefy as they could be, but they hold. These are some great looking grilles and are easy to install."
1,not a 2 items.. its a set of item.!,dont buy this... !!! it says 2-pc..the 1st piece is the speaker grill the 2nd piece is the base....!! don't get fooled..!! youre been warned..!!
3,Great for card making,Found this book very informative for making some different but nice looking hand-made cards to give for special occassions.
2,Not a book for a beginning card maker,"I was disappointed in this book, and subsequently returned it, because it required many expensive scrapbooking items in order to make the cards pictured. A beginner would literally spend well over a hundred dollars for materials just to get started, not to mention the hours needed to complete each card. Perhaps an advanced card maker with supplies on hand would not be as disappointed. Also, I found the cards to be too ""artsy"" for my taste. There was only one card design of interest to me."
1,Middle And Long Distances,"I ordered a book, Middle And Long Distances, and twice was sent a video. I returned the video twice. I was told I would be credited for my costs, but am not sure whether or not I have received that credit.I would have liked to have received the book and was extremely dissatisfied with receiving the video twice."
5,Dead on advice!!,"Coming from a male who has been extremely fortunate to have been very successful with women (happily married now!) -- I say that the advice the author gives on how to ""close the deal"" is 100% accurate. This is really a one-sided book however: it is written for women. The insightful direction given is for women on how to deal with men in all stages of a loving relationship. While I feel I can go on and on, let me simply suggest that every woman who is even slightly confused by male behavior with respects to love and committment to buy and read this book very carefully."
4,STRINGS TO LULL YOU TO SLEEP,"A beautiful recording by Angèle Dubeau and her all-female string group, La Pietà. The sound is lush and very soothing, the playing always well tempered, with a soft, almost romantic touch. LULLABY by Brahms is the opening number. Lovely rendition of the FORBIDDEN GAMES theme (no guitar). Strange mix of UN CANADIEN ERRANT and DANNY BOY... Trouble is with this CD, it may well lull you to sleep. It does start with a lullaby."
1,WHY MARRIAGE MATTERS,"READER SHOULD BE AWARE THIS IS A ""FOCUS ON THE FAMILY"" BOOK AND THE MORALISTIC DRUM BEAT IS CONSTANT."
4,80's dance and soul explosion,"D-TRAIN CAME ON THE SCENE IN THE EARLY ""80'S"" WITH A GREAT NEW SOUND. THE MUSIC WAS NOT ONLY GOOD TO DANCE TO, BUT HAD A MESSAGE FOR EVERYONE. IN THE SINGLE ""KEEP ON"", D-TRAIN MADE IT CLEAR THAT NOTHING SHOULD EVER HOLD AN INDIVIDUAL BACK FROM DOING WHAT HE OR SHE BELIEVED IN AND SO REPEATED THAT MESSAGE THROUGH-OUT THE ENTIRE SONG. THE WORDS WERE SUNG WITH CONVICTION AND URGED EVERYONE ONE WITH ""THE SKY'S IS THE LIMIT AND YOU KNOW THAT HAVE WHAT YOU WANT AND BE WHO YOU WANT."" THE RHYTHM WAS KEPT WITH A VERY FUNKY SOUL BEAT"
4,still bumping,"the title track alone still keeps my feet flying.""you're the one for me"" is a Head Bopping Funk Throw down. the rest of the Album has some decent cuts.the Keyboard work on here is still slamming.still a cool Record."
1,Defective After Third Use,"This was my first grill pan and I absolutely loved it... at first. We don't have a lot of money to spend on nice pans but I thought with a 10 year warranty this pan is probably pretty durable and would last a long time. However, even after reading and following the directions on how to properly care for this pan the coating began to chip off within three uses. I bought another non-stick skillet pan from Calphalon at the same time we bought this grill pan and that one has been fine. I am disappointed with this grill pan and will be sending it back to the company."
3,Ridges not deep!,"I bought this for my Son, and I was very Disapointed to find, the Ridges were not as deep as I expected at all...I expected the Ridge's to be as deep and sharp as my Panini Grill.Not low and oval, were the meat looks like its resting on the bottom of the Grill PanAll my Cookware is Caphalon, so am sure this Grill pan is great, but as far as taking the fat away from the meat,Don't think that is going to happen!I don't think this grill pan can even leave Grill Marks!!I'm going to look for a Different Grill Pan for my self.I think I have given all My Calphalon a 5 star, but just can't with this pan!"
1,Not nonstick,"I had the regular version of the Calphalon grill pan but had grown tired of the laborious process of cleaning it after each use so switched to the nonstick version. I have to say I can't see any difference between the two. Both do a fine job in terms of even heating and nice creation of grill marks, but they also are both equally difficult to clean afterwards. And this applies across using them each with a variety of foods at a variety of temperatures. I see no need to spend the extra money on the non-stick version."
4,good pan,good pan. works well and cleans up easily. not as wonderful and my Anolon Nouvelle pans which are pretty amazing
5,Calphalon Grill Pan Review,We use our Calphalon Nonstick grill pan several times a week to cook everything from panninis to ahi tuna. The ribs leave a carmalized grill look on the food and allow us to use just a little olive oil when cooking. I highly recommend this product as a basic staple for every kitchen.
5,Calphalon Grill Pan,"This has been (almost) the most-used kitchen device we've ever had, much better than our gas grill."
1,Non-stick doesn't last long.,"Bought this pan about a year ago. After about four uses, food began sticking. Despite my most careful cooking and cleaning, the sticking problem just got worse. Finally tossed the pan in the trash today. Never again"
4,Great grill pan,We are so impressed with this grill pan. We wanted a grill that we can use during the cold winter months and still enjoy some grilling. The pan cooks evenly and no hot spots. Creates great grill marks on the meats too. Clean up is a breeze. Great pan!
4,GREAT GRILL PAN,"This is a great grill pan - although the same one I got about three years ago is a bit heavier and I think grills a bit better. But overall I love it. I've grilled boneless chicken breasts, steak, vegetables - just heat the pan for 5-10 minutes & then grill like you would on an outside grill. For me this is a staple in my kitchen for healthy and delicious cooking!"
4,Nice,"I really enjoy this pan. The grill lines that result make it look like it was on the grill rack, but with having to go outside to use the grill.It's a very nice pan. Calphalon is a good brand.My only problem was the price. Forty dollars for a pan seems pretty outrageous, but it's a good sized pan. If you want the grill feel, but in a pan inside, then this would suit you nicely."
1,Bad material and I threw it away,I bought this pan and thought I would love it. It didn't take me long to realize that this pan was awful. The coating kept coming off and getting on whatever I was cooking. It was hard to clean and I had to throw it out. I am only leaving this review because I might save someone else some money. I wish I had read this review before I bought this pan. I am also leaving this because I nearly bought a large roaster that was a little cheaper and after I read a review from someone I knew I had to get the better one. The reviewer said his coating fell off after a couple of uses. I appreciated that and my good roaster is still in perfect working order. The above pan went in the garbage about a year ago.
1,Not a grill pan!,"Do not buy this pan! It arrived yesterday (overnight shipping), opened it and washed it so I could do thick pork chops for dinner! First, I noticed the bottom inside (grill area) was ALMOST FLAT! I proceeded with the chops and the entire surfaced of the meat cooked. NO GRILL MARKS!Be happy and look at something different. Trust me, this is not a grill pan!I will give this to my neighbor to use on his outdoor camping trips. I guess all is not lost..At least for him!"
2,Eh....,"This didn't do it for me. Husband bought it as a gift. Great from grilled cheese and burgers, but not much else, imo.I have had the most terrible luck trying to clean the inside edges of the ""grill marks."" I've tried it all, but it stays there and looks gross, since it's old food/grease that won't come off. Not for me:("
4,Very impressed with this pan!,"We bought a round gas-top grill from Costco before and we had a love/hate relationship with it. It was hard to clean, couldn't get in the grooves to scrub out the stuck bits, and it was very heavy with no handles. This pan is a lifesaver! Food cooks evenly (grilled cheeses, steaks, asparagus tips), makes great grill lines, we can still have great grilled food smack dab in the middle of winter, and the clean up is a breeze! No more heavy scrubbing! Very durable, great pan!"
4,Playmobil Skull Hideout,Gift for a four year old. He is very interested in pirates and is receiving many playmobil items. This looks like fun.
1,Assumed,the kit says its a 1 1/2 inch kit. I didnt read the product description where is says its only 1 inch. Furthermore it does not come with the U-bolts which are around $15 a piece.
5,Black Bear is cool,"My daughter has 10 webkinz, but Blackie (her Black Bear) was the first! It's fun as a plushie and fun online. It's very cute online. If you get it, likely you'll love it! It's just so soft and furry!"
5,GREAT RADIO,"My portable radio,cd cassette player was received in a timely manner The color is really pretty. I use it at work with headphones.Sound quality is great and is easy to use,just plug in and listen. I didnt mark battery life because I haven't needed to use it yet, but I'm sure it will be fine based on the qualitys it already has.Thanks"
4,What kind of business you have?,"When We placed order for this product, we didn't see it's listed as a used, or second hand. We intended to re-sell. The box was torn, not clean. Disappointed."
3,Good for the money,"This is a good stereo for the price. Easy to use, does not get the best reception for the radio. I think I get like 3 stations total and I live in a very metro area."
1,BUYER BEWARE,Be careful buying Emerson Electronic products thru Discounts Jungle. Emerson states that they are not an authorized distributor and would not warranty a radio/cd player that was purchased in December. Very disappointing that no one will back this product and the CD player never worked.
1,"Sound not great, CD player stopped working.","I was disappointed with this CD player. It stopped working after 7 to 8 months. Also, I thought I was getting a black and silver one and it was blue when it arrived. The sound is kind of tinny and has no xtra bass button. I would not recommend this player."
2,CD BROKE AFTER 9 MOS.,Bought this CD player and CD was dead after 9 mos. Radio and cassette are fine but CD a bust!
1,Would not recommend,Purchased this cd player for my son. He is 2 and we play cd's for him at night when he sleeps. The cd player stopped working after 3 nights. Sent it back and purchased a sony
2,worked for a while.,"I received this cd and tape player as a gift about a year and a half ago. I use it to listen to radio, cds, or tapes at work while I work. The tape player doesn't automatically stop at the end of a tape. You have to push the stop button to get the play button to pop up. That is the reason I think that my tape player wore out. The knobs inside to turn the tape will no longer turn but the play will still push the film through and thus it chews and ruins every tape I now put in it. So it worked for a year and a half and I really liked it but now I think when I buy a replacement I will find a better quality one."
4,Great Gift for Kids,It holds up well to the kids' abuse. They use it all of the time. For the price it is difficult to beat.
2,Not what we expected.,"I was highly disappointed in this CD player. Hoping to get something for my five year old. It wouldn't play his CD's he received in Kids Meals, wouldn't play a CD someone burned for him or CD's we bought at the store. All of these played in numerous other CD players we have. The tape deck and radio worked fine. I was forced to buy another player for him and I will be contacting the manufacturer to see what we can do with this one. I would not suggest buying this one if you are looking for a decent CD player."
2,CD works/doesn't work,"Bought this for grandchild's first player for Bible Stories. On the first try the CD threw an error code, then tried again and it worked. Tried different CDs and same result. It looks like there is some special sequence to make the thing work but at this point, I would not recommend the purchase. My son did like the cassette player as he listened to his old tapes from the 1980s."
4,Works great,"Everything is all about iPods, iPhones nowadays which we have several, along with different docks for them, but it is nice to have one of these around too. Product works just fine. My kids can use this outside and we can take it on trips. I think it was a good value."
2,Not a bad machine,I bought this for a party and it did pretty good. Now I will use it in our screen room..sound is good but not great.
1,Worst piece of crap ever. Don't ever buy Emerson.,"I bought this little boombox for my office and used it a little now and then - probably used the CD player about 6 times and turned on the radio about 12 times over the course of 9 months. At first it worked fine. Then, months later, and at about the same time, the CD player stopped working and volume control no longer worked so that the volume stayed at a blaring level all the time. The is the worst piece of crap I have ever purchased in my life. It looked brand new still when I had to throw it out.Also, I wrote a letter to Emerson about the poor quality and NO ONE ever bothered to respond. Not a letter, not a phone call, nor an email, even though I included multiple ways to contact me.If you want to feel completely ripped off by a company, purchase this radio."
3,giving as a christmas gift so I cannot rate this product at this time,"I purchased this item as a christmas gift for someone, so I am unable to rate this product at this time"
1,Almost Instantly Replaceable,"I use this in the bathroom while I'm showering and I had only replaced my last boombox with this one a few weeks earlier. Then, I gradually had problems getting the CD's to play. Finally, the CD player simply stopped playing. The disc turned but no sound."
2,Works great for about 3 months,Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife to replace one that she has had for a number of years. Worked great right out of the box. played Cd's and she was so happy to be able to play her tapes again that she hasn't been able to play for the last couple of years. After about three months the Cd's would play sometimes and not at other times. 3 months later the Cd's no longer played and the the player started eating tapes. It is a cheap player. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,CD Player stopped working after 6 weeks,"All I wanted was a CD player. At first, this product was just fine. Sure, the sound was a bit tinny, but that's what I expected. I used it happily for weeks.After about six weeks, it began having intermittent trouble playing CDs -- sometimes it wouldn't play a CD at first, then after a few attempts, it would play it fine.But the failures quickly became more frequent than the successes until I couldn't get it to play CDs at all.Emerson customer service (at the phone number on the instructions pamphlet) suggested I try cleaning the lens with a Q-tip and alcohol and said that if that didn't work, I should ""return it to the store for service"". I tried cleaning the lens, but it didn't help. Sigh. Grrr.I liked this product when it worked, but I certainly can't recommend it now!"
5,I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE,"I shopped around for months needing a good radio and cassette player, but had a hard time finding that combination and then I couldn't find one under $45. When I saw this one at Amazon.com, it was a find for 2 reasons: the price was a bargain and it had the cassette along with the CD player vs. no cassette at all. Well, I am delighted: It is lightweight, has a Sterio FM radio and the sound is solid and clear on FM and AM as well. It came in my favorite color and on top of all that I could not believe it was actually set to my local christian radio station when I turned it on!!! Amazon.com is good at delivery, too. It came sooner than I expected."
4,A Many-Layered Biography,"I picked this up, wanting to read her childhood experiences in Germany during WWII. Those were vivid and candid, telling of her conflicts with her mother and the hardships of the time. They led me further into her life as she moved to America, reveled in travel experiences as a stewardess, floundered through a failed marriage, developed an academic career, fell in love with Bill Bradley, juggled motherhood and career, and finally coped with breast cancer.It's a full life, but well examined. She reveals her turmoil and growth in dealing with a variety of issues through her life. Once or twice I almost set it aside, but was drawn back to it. An interesting woman. The book appeals to a variety of readers: admirers of her political husband, anyone interested in WWII experiences, women trying to find balance in their lives, and those who just like a good biography."
5,A great product,"I recently purchased 5 pieces of Calphalon Contemporary non-stick cookware (individual pieces, not a set) and it's all great. This 4 1/2 qt. steamer/saucepan is great as well. I bought it from Amazon.com because they had the best price and free shipping. It's a bit on the heavy side, but is perfect for cooking pasta as it is deep and wide, creating good circulation of the water. It's also really good for soups. I like all the cookware I have purchased in this line. It heats very evenly and cleans up easily."
5,very versatile,"We love this new pot. Whether boiling then draining pasta, or steaming veggies, it is quickly becoming the go-to pot in the kitchen for many meals."
5,Great Saucepot/Steamer!,I love Calphalon products - have used them for years. This item is particularly useful as if can be used as a steamer as well as a stock pot for making stews or soups. Can be used on top of the stove or in the oven. Very versatile. You can't beat it!
5,Great fishing pole,"I am lucky to live in hawaii where the fishing is awesome. I decided to start kayak fishing about a year and a half ago to get to the bigger fish. Well the fish are a lot bigger than I thought they would be so I upgraded from my trusty 8"" Ugly Stik to this Ugly Stik Tiger. I am very glad I did. This weekend I put it to the test when I hooked into a 20.5 lb Ulua (giant trevally)! The action of the pole was perfect. I matched it to a Penn 850 ssm with 30lbs test and it is the perfect combo for inshore trolling. I highly recommend this for any angler who needs the sensitivity and strength to land the big ones. I will never fish with anything else."
1,Very POOR manufacturing and description,"Poor manufacturing. The screw lock for reel seat cracked immediately even before it got engaged. Does this rod have graphite twist-lock reel seats as advertised? The answer is NO, and the description was not enough to confirm this. The screw was made of piece of cheap plastic. Can you imagine a fishing rod that cannot hold the reel? This rod ruined my recent fishing trip, and I had to spend extra dollars to buy replacement. What a waste of time and money."
4,great rod bad reel seat,"As long as you dont mind using duct tape to hold your reel to the ugly stick,it is a great rod. the tape just makes it more ugly."
5,"Sturdy rod, great action","I was a little concerned about the plastic reel holder, but so far it has held fine and does not appear to be coming loose or breaking apart. The rod part is well built and has great action. I have already successfully caught several fish on this rod for its first season of use."
5,Tough salt water ready- excellent value- great price,"What can I say- have never been one to desire expensive saltwater rods- have owned and used hard many Shakespeare Ugly Sticks over the past 25 years- we use them fishing striped bass and blues off Cape Cod...six of these rods- most this light weight model, sit in the Whaler on the mooring from late May to mid Septemer....most rods would corrode or fall apart, but the Ugly sticks take a lickin and keep on Tickin.....I have had these rods bent over from top to bottom on a 20 lb Striper on a light rod with no problems.....many rods just break....the only issues I ever have are a few knocked out or broken line guide insert-(aluminum oxide??)...I just replace them and move on.....I still keep some of these old rods, 20+ years old, and use them for the grandkids and folks new to fishing who seem to hit the center console when casting etc....Can't say enough good on these rods...they are my best example of value in a world where the name is disappearing"
4,"Shakespeare Two-Piece Medium Action Ugly Stik Spinning Rod, 7-Feet",My husband and his brother like the rods but one thing the handle is too short. They go fishing almost every Friday. Tullis
4,Well done but ...,"Meticulously illustrated in great detail. The binding needs to be changed however. I've purchased 2 and both have lost pages. A spiral bound, flat lying guide would be a big improvement."
4,wrong color,"sent the wrong color despite the ordered color being clearly stated on the invoice; not worth sending it back for a return/exchange. This is the problem with net shopping, and providers depend on it."
2,Dead battery,"All was as promised except the lithium ion battery pack arrived kaput. Will not charge -- completely useless. Ordered another from Dell just now for $250.Oh, well . . ."
4,Mildly Interesting,"THE AYN RAND COLUMN is a collection of columns that Rand wrote for the LA Times in 1962. It also contains a number of other essays by Rand which, for the most part, haven't been published. Even longtime fans of Rand will find something new here.No doubt Rand's uncritical admirers will insist that ""the material is just as timely now as it was in 1962"" but quite a bit of it is dated. Nonetheless, the book has its merits. Rand was a good writer and these columns highlight her ability to write short, punchy pieces that get to the point and occasionally make insightful and important points. There are also no diatribes against religion, ""mysticism,"" religious people who worship death, etc. that tends to mar her more serious philosophical essays. Rand claimed never to compromise, but she certainly knew her audience.So chalk up a minor success for the Ayn Rand Institute."
3,Wow,"Cubix, robot's for everyone is clearly build for VERY young gamers.Battling is extremely basic, and bad, and annoying, attacks. While battling is not easy, it's still enjoyable.The mini games are built for 5-13 year gamers.Really, this game isn't worth your money."
2,Extremely disappointed,This was for my granddaughter and I wasn't going to give it to her once I saw it. My daughter said that was Webkinz style - I went ahead and gave it as a gift - but I'll never purchase one again.
4,Lacking a thing or two.....,"the game is fun to play, but what really makes this game bad is that you can not save the races that you are playing. meaning, if you are racing on a particular course, and you have to leave and you can not finish that particular race, then you can not save it and come back to it and you have start all over. this sucks. especially when the last race before the final mission is a 50-lap endurance race. if you could save your races and come back to them, then this game would be a five for me. graphics and content are good nonetheless and it is worth the money."
1,Lame game,"This game is lame! I have been racing for over 20 years and the first review is totally inaccurate! The license he speaks of doesn't even exist. Take it from me, A REAL PROFESSIONAL RACECAR DRIVER, this game will cause you to have a wreck because you will be asleep before the first lap is over! Besides, if the guy in the first review was really a racecar driver he would not be on here writing reviews about video games! Like I said, I have been a real racecar driver for over 15 years!"
2,Clock not as advertised,"Amazon says clock is 3x4x1"" That is the size of the package the clock comes in, not the clock. The clock is less than 2"" in diameter."
2,This book is not written by an expert on the subject.,I've read this guide while living here in Costa Rica and find it paints an unrealistic picture about how easy it is to start a business. Furthermore I recently found out the author has not lived in Costa Rica for years and is somewhat out of touch with what is going on.
2,This guide is O.K. but not the best on the subject.,I have been thinking about living in Costa Rica for the last couple of years and have read three other books on the subject. This guide has a couple of good sections but as a whole doesn't measure up to the quality of the other books I have read about residing in Costa Rica
5,This is a must read!!!!!!!!,"This is the most complete book I have ever read. By this I mean that it's characters are interesting, it has a labyrinthine plot, and the writing style is extremely interesting. One of the comments on the back of the book by reviews compares his prose style to Joyce and Nabokov. I don't happen to agree with this assessment. If anyone he reminds me, at least narratively, of one of my favorite authors Robertson Davies. If you're an enthusiast of Robertson Davies you will enjoy this book. Conversely, if you like this one you will love Robertson Davies. Read this book!"
3,"Mediocre, disappointing.","From the author of the powerful, wonderful Winter's Tale and A Soldier of the Great War, this is a cleverly-written, but slow-moving curiousity. It is hard for this reader to care about the antihero"
4,Rich and rewarding with a marvelous main character.,"I enjoyed this book immensely, but it's not a thrillerthat kept me up late, eager to finish. The intricatepsychological plot had me rethinking previous passagesas they changed meaning with the progression of the plot.Helprin's descriptions are a thick stew of metaphorsthat need to be chewed carefully.Highly recommended."
1,Don't bother,"I read this book when I was out of the country, and if I had had another book available, I would have stopped reading Ant Proof Case. It's a fantasy that tries to be realistic, and that is a doomed effort. There are better books to read if you want World War 2 pilot stories, or bank robbery stories, or stories of making love to Brazilian women. I just couldn't accept a story where this guy can do whatever he wants. He walks up to a beautiful bank teller he has never met, 30 years his junior, says he loves her, and she agrees to marry him right away. Also, the thing about hating coffee is just so dumb. I kept thinking, 'ok this is dumb, but it won't play a big part in the story.' But it does. It just keeps coming up and coming up and never makes any sense. The only good thing I can say about this book is that the robbery caper part of the story kept me somewhat interested. Otherwise, what a waste of 500 pages."
4,An Enjoyable Read,If you have never read anything by Mark Helprin this would be a good place to start. He's a very skillful writer with a beautifully descriptive style sprinkled with quirky humor. If you like books that are tightly structured with a definite build up (such as a suspense novel or thriller) Helprin is probably not your cup of tea. But if you love terrific writing give this author a try.
5,Really Enjoyed It,"This is a very entertaining novel about an old man reflecting back on his very active, many times eccentric, sometimes moving, while at other times funny life. Much of the humor in this book is written in a subtle (and in my opinion, clever) manner, and in a number of cases made me laugh out loud. Other parts of the book seemed to be very sincere insights to the typical roller coaster of life we all experience in one way or another (perhaps not to the extent of the main character). I haven't read the author's other books (someone recommended this one to me), but some of the reviews below seem to punish Memoir From An Antproof Case because the others are better. If that is so, good for the other titles! But I enjoyed this one a lot all the same."
3,Good but a slow start.,"The novel was a fun romp through many different adventures and situations. The central character was interesting and had a unique outlook on life but the novel started slowly, and I was not truly ""into"" the story until about halfway through. On the whole, enjoyable though."
5,Mark Helprin is greatest living novelist.,"Mark Helprin's ""Winter's Tale"" was best novel I have read in the past 25 years. ""A Soldier of the Great War"" was also one of the best written novels I have read. ""Memoir From Antproof Case"" is right behind ""Winter's Tale"" in sheer writing virtueosity. Helprin can use words, images, thoughts, stories in a beautiful web. William Faulkner is greatest novelist in last 100 years, and Mark Helprin is greatest living novelist."
2,Read Helprin's other works first!,"This is not a bad book but somewhat ""curious"" and a bitlong. Read ""A Soldier of the Great War"", ""Ellis Island"",and ""Winter's Tale"" before even considering this book,especially if you've never read Helprin. ""Memoir"" fallswell short of these."
3,"Very fine writing, frivolous plot","Mark Helprin is one of the most gifted writers in the English language. If you don't believe it, read A Soldier of the Great War, one of the most wonderful novels in many years. Ant-Proof Case displays Helprin's incredible use of language, but it's in the service of story that is merely diverting, rather than profound, as in Soldier. The protagonist's account of his life veers between acute sensitivity and buffoonery. There are images that will stay with you, perhaps for a long time, such as his exaggerated contempt for coffee and his descriptions of dogfights in the Second World War, but the truly insightful observations on life that are sprinkled throughout the work tend to get overshadowed by the clownishness. It's almost as if Helprin was embarrassed by his emotional refinement and wanted to laugh his way out of it. In Soldier of the Great War, it is his unabashed embrace of that sensitivity that makes the book a masterpiece."
5,A fine writer,There are few pieces of writing which I'd recommend wholeheartedly to virtually everyone I know. This is one of them.
4,Another excellent Helprin story.....,"If the lyrics to Jimmy Buffet's, He Went to Paris, ever set you to daydreaming you've found a book that matches the song in spirit. An old man in South America through his memoir, kept in an Antproof case, tells the twists and turns of an eccentric, joyous, tragic, worldly, and comical life. Helprin's in top form again and I can't imagine any lover of books not enthralled with this tale. Short enough to consume in one sitting and delightful enough to pick up again down the road, Memoir from Antproof Case is a first-class, highly recommended read."
4,"First Mark Helprin novel, and not bad!","I had no idea what to expect from this book, but decided that I liked it tons. It sort of reminded me of Holden Caufield at 90, writing his (bizarre) memoirs. It certainly wouldn't be for everyone, as it is quite bizarre, but I really liked it, and will recommend it to two of my bizarre friends -- over coffee..."
1,Not worth the effort.,"I read this as it was a selection for our book club. Long, boring and generally ghastly. I will admit there were flashes of brilliant humor but in all I would recommend reading something else. Even Moby Dick with its discussions of whale anatomy is overall more gripping."
2,Disappointing,"Mostly pointless and pretentious. Helprin just seems to be showing off. It doesn't work. The coffee fueled plot generates no tension, and the hero generates no sympathy. The novel said to me ""I'm so good, I can write about anything and make it meaningful."" No you can't.There was also an annoying (to me) lack of attention to details. A pilot suffers under multiple G forces when he pulls out of a dive, not when he pushes the plane into it. The chemical nomenclature a professor uses to describe caffeine did not come into use until decades later. I realize that these are piddling complaints, but they become distractions when much of the book is devoted to the author showing off how much he knows.A number of reviewers claim that this is his worst book. I hope so, but even so based on my feelings about this one I don't see myself reading his others any time soon."
1,Don't waste your time,"What did I miss? To me this story is the egocentric meanderings of a old whacko. Dull as dirt much of the time, interspersed with pompous rantings and preposterous ""adventures"". The story requires, but does not inspire, suspension of disbelief. Helprin reminds me of the many male writers who portray male characters with superhuman strength, endurance, etc. Is this wishful thinking, male fantasy or what? I forced my way through it only because my book club selected it."
4,Elvis is in the building!,"At a party my brother-in-law told me he had an album by a Scottish Elvis impersonator; I said ""Get Out!"" He assured me it was really good and put it in the player. I was totally blown away by the way this guy took popular hits and made them his own. This band is tight and the vocals, well you'd swear Elvis was in the building. This album is in a genre all its own."
4,Kid's like learning English with this,"This is a well, organized, colorful text, that my students enjoy using. I inherited this choice from my predessor, but have been pleased with the way Let's Go uses songs, chants and logical situations to teach vocabulary and grammar."
5,Amazing!,"My mother had been looking for this book for some time. At almost 80 she delighted in seeing a book she once owned as a child. We had a good time as she sang through the book, songs she loved and once knew well."
1,What Is This!,This song is almost horrible. The part where they sing I do...cherish you is the only good part. I like The Hardest Thing but other then that I don't really like 98 Degrees.
4,Very Deep,This is a good book. It is a very good Cebuano reference. The only complaint I have about the book is that many of the words in the dictionary are very deep and would not be easily understood by the younger cebuano natives.
3,its ok...,we expected the english cebuano and visayan to be separate...they are all together under the english word...what if you do not know the english word...it ok i guess other product we have had do separate the dialects
2,Displeased with DeWalt,"I purchased this drill and right out of the box the cluch would not work in the first speed. Had to take it to service center and was told this was normal for the new XRP series; It needed to brake in. Also was warned about changing speeds: He had already repaced a few gear boxes. I have not accually used the drill that much yet. It has plenty of power, but this is overshadowed by the problems."
2,Barking dog,"I bought this player for it's MP3 capability, HOWEVER, when in MP3 mode, the player emits a random ugly ""barking"" sound in the right channel. There is even a mention of this in an addendum to the user manual. Philips calls it ""monkey chatter"", supposedly caused by ""random electrostatic discharge"", whatever that means. All I know is, it is extremely annoying and it totally ruins the sound of most MP3's played through it.The unit works fine when playing music CDs, but if you want to play MP3's, stay away from this barking dog."
5,Just right,"The turtle float arrived on time and fit easily and perfectly into the tank. The slanting ""ramp"" makes it easy for the turtle to climb on. Last time I bought one similar to these (same manufacturer, I think), the turtle eventually chewed away at it until it dawned on me that the shape had changed and how small it had become. Hope this one has a better fate!"
3,Problems climbing,"My RES turtle has problems climbing into this dock and basking on it. She keeps trying to get on it and splashes back in the water, and gets on it on her 3rd or 4th attempt. I plan to return and replace this dock with the Turtle Topper when I get around to it."
2,Grows alot of algae and it broke within the first 5 months,"This is a great idea and the turtle loved to get out of the water but it grows horrible algae really fast, the suction cups didn't last long and the little plastic legs broke within the first 5 months so it didn't last long. Our Petco sells this in their store for 25.00 so I guess it's a good deal if you can get yours to last.As a side note, it's also not that stable. It tilts to the side and sometimes our turtle was half in the water and half out. I bought a different turtle dock for the corner of the tank that seems to be easier for him to stabalize on."
3,middle of the road,1st I must say. Some if not most of zoomeds items like this basking dock is made with a paint-like substance that peels off into my clean turtle tank...I'm unsure how safe it it or if its lead ..if so then lawsuits can follow if someone's pet dies due to swallowing this...I don't know but I'm tired of scooping up the partials that comes from this item. Maybe its foam dunked in paint but ZooMed need to create something more safer than this coating. And it was gritty coming out of the box so I rinsed it off and it still has particles that float into my clean water.If this didn't happen it would b great...My turtle likes to climb on it but he has to get used to it after using another bank made differently.
3,Okay for medium-size turtles,"I bought this for my two red ear sliders (actually, this is the second one I bought).It's a nice basking area if your turtles are less than 6"" in diameter. Otherwise they are just too big and -more importantly- too heavy, and the dock won't support their weight. The turtles will also be strong enough to rip the suction cups off the wall."
3,Broke,"When I got it it was broken :(. It came earlier than expected which was great I needed it here! But I got excited that it was here early, opened it and there was a big crack! I didn't have time to send it back and get a new one so my mom helped and we did a quick fix. My mom was really mad, we would have sent it back but we had planned on getting the turtles that weekend. Since the quick fix it is working fine. My turtles love getting on it and basking. I have a 55gallon and it fits really well. This might have been a simple mistake but since the item ismostly made of foam they should have been more careful."
4,Worth it,"Just got into turtle keeping. While waiting for this I bought one of those corner basking stairs from wmart...big mistake. You'll eventually figure out or need to keep the water deeper. This works out perfectly for that as the platform can float up and down. I think it is foam but is pretty sturdy. Probably work for my two turtles until they are bigger than 3.5""With that said, you could probably build something similar with some nice wood you find outside, suction cups, and a few zip ties.But for the rest of us kids this is recommended!"
4,*my soul sister*,"this is a wonderful collection of classic songs brought to live by dillon's soulful vocal honesty. These songs range from lovelorn ballads like ""Don't Stay Away"" to sassy songs such as ""Don't Touch Me Tomato"". Another favorite is her cover of ""Midnight Confession"" which brings a new softness and depth to an otherwise upbeat and dancy song. I was also really glad to see her CD on here since her music is rather difficult to find. I had to order her other CD ""Love Was All I Had"" from Holland!"
3,Female Masturbation : Orgasm One Stroke at a Time. Volume I,"It was very interesting to watch another women masturbate like this on TV. I don't think I will watch it again, it is more of an educational DVD. Just to inform the other ladies who are thinking of getting this, the young lady who gracefully enjoys herself must be European,(her legs were shaved).Although it was very tastefully done, I aplaude her."
1,"Not very good, and way over priced","Its very important for anyone thinking of buying this to realize that you are going to watch a VERY hairy woman masturbate for the full length of the video. I mean this woman has hair from mid-thigh to over her belly button, you cannot underestimate the importance of that one fact right there when it comes to making your decision on this purchaseIf that's your thing, great. If not, you could be totally repulsed by this, as I was."
2,Shaggy!,"I have never in my life seen a person, or an animal for that matter, with so much pubic hair. And I'm including here dogs, cats, foxes,minks, rabbits... This is not just the ""au naturel"" look of the 1960s, we are talking a deep, dark, bushy, shaggy forest. It not only is distracting, but there is little you can actually see ""through the trees and bushes"" so to speak."
1,dvds on sex,Not what it claims to be. The woman in the dvd need to shave herself a little down below.
1,Yuck!,"The hair of the woman in the video goes up her stomach, up her thighs and down her crack! Unconvincing orgasm, I guess the gush of fluid was proof though."
1,top,This video is only barely passable. The woman never even removes her top (what a cheat)! Also a man and a woman make audio comments in a voice over that is annoying and pointless. One viewing of this video was enough to know that I need never watch it again.
1,Just terrible,"Terrible spiritual book! The author can not have put much work into this one. All it says is be here, over and over. Sure it's a good message, but I don't need a book for telling me that. There are also some theories about that anything can happen because you create the world, and it says you may be kidnapped by aliens if you want that to happen. Weird thing to write, weird thing to read, a terrible spiritual book."
4,Bloody fun - somewhat,"The shark isn't too hard to control if you go into the controls menu and adjust some settings. Some advanced moves are rather hard using a keyboard.Your shark can free roam through most levels causing mayhem and death everywhere. However,when you have giant ships shooting at you from everywhere, it becomes a bit tedious. There is enough variation to keep the game interesting for awhile. There are a few minor flaws but they are minor and do not detract much from game play. This is well worth the 20 bucks if you can deal with all the blood and guts, torture and mayhem you cause. Bloody fun - somewhat."
5,for the price you cant go wrong,this game ranks among the best ive played when considering the price...im surprised it wasnt more popular
4,Jaws Video Game,"Fun Game, but because it is older technology, it is fun but not as good as other more up to date games."
3,A Law Unto Himself by Frances Roding (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:Francesca di Valeria had grown up believing that she was destined to marry Paolo di Calveri. When he jilted her, she found herself free at last: free to make her own choices, to escape from her grandfather's dominating shadow. But the holiday in England which was meant to help her get over the shock of Paolo's desertion plunged her into conflict with another dominating man. Oliver Newton, the acid-tongued writer who lived nearby, seemed to take a delight in mocking Francesca, and it was clearly against his will that he was forced to ask her help ..."
2,Cheated on the Quintet,The Quintet for Strings should be between 56 and 60 minutes in duration. This recording is a scant 47 minutes.
5,Good product,Well balanced and attractive knife holder. Much safer to put knives in a sturdy knife holder than loose in a drawer. Especially like that it is bamboo. Sustainability of bamboo is always good.
1,Can't believe I even considered it,This is expensive and doesn't have slots for steak knives. I got a more useful one that does - and at half the price - at a local department store.
1,Not just garbage. Smelly garbage,"I read ""At Your Own Risk."" Why don't Amazon reviewers get the choice of giving zero stars? I would have. The author was paid by the AMA to right this Third Reich dribble. Enough said."
5,Excellent,This book is excellent! This book shows how chiropractic is the biggest scam of the century. I strongly recommend this book.
5,What a cracker!,"Received a copy of this book as a present. Initial reaction was ""OK ... thank you ... (I hope I can read this all the way through)"".Put it aside but took it along with me on a fortnights holiday. Spent several days in stitches when I finally opened the book to read. Am not sure whether the humour in the book will appeal to those with AngloSaxon roots or some other vein of humour. But it is one of the funniest books I have ever read. The story of the trial conducted in West Hartlepool had me in tears."

1,Do NOT buy this item!!!,"This is very deceptive of the seller because this case is clearly too too too small for the LG Chocolate phone. Its made for the Razor. Its too narrow, too small, and too tight for this phone."
2,"some useful information, oversimplified discussion of art","This book was useful to get the overview of what museums are the most well-known, and the information as to location and opening hours was useful. Beyond that, I can't recommend this book for anyone with a college education and an interest in art. I went to europe with no background in art history, and found the taped headsets in the Louvre and other museums (Musee D'Orsay, the Uffizi, Vatican museum) to be so much more informative, without any technical language or tedious narrative. I would recommend that you save your money to buy a book on the artist(s) or period that most takes you fancy after visiting the museums!"
5,Fantastic Guide Book,Rick Steves takes the vast museums of Euope and tells you how to navigate them to see the good things and not waste time on the mediocre. The book is a joy to read. My wife and I tear out the sections coveringthe museums we are visiting so we do not have to carry the entirevolume. This is a very entertaining book. -- FJD
4,Excellent for European visitors unfamiliar with art,"If, like me, you love travel but do not know very much about art or history and want to make the most of your time in Europe, this book is a must. I found it very useful - I used it in conjunction with Rick Steves and Gene Openshaw's other book ""Europe 101"" and found the combination to be great. I would certainly recommend ""Mona Winks"" to anyone going to Europe - my copy is certainly very dog-earred!!!"
3,My review,I think this book was great.It talked about the life of a teenager messing up in school and how he runs away from his problems.
5,"An entertaining book, good for fifteen years of age or older","I actually understood Holden's situation. He would become so frustrated that he would not know what to do or where to go. I agree when another entry said this book is good for teenagers, because in my experience (not that I have very much, seeing as how I am very young), teenagers experience so many frustrations. They don't feel like doing this, they hate all those stupid 'wanna-be's'. This book made me feel not as stupid and annoying as I thought I was. I really did feel sorry for Holden, but in the end, it was all going to work out."
4,"i'm picky, but this is a good read","I don't read much cause it takes a something good to keep my attention. This book was suggested to me in english class, and i have to say it was a good read."
1,Get a life!,"I read the book and thought it was terrible; there were too many simbles and too much description,there was not enough chericterization, and a poor use of language! You don't have to use ""bad words"" make your point. BUY THE CLIFFS NOTES, DON'T REED THE BOOK!"
1,"""BAD WORDS""","I thought that the book was quite bouring, and was not interested in the point it was making. I really don't care if you like the book or not the language used in the book made it weak. I'm not some activists that thinks it should be baned from school, but the point of the noval was lost in the continues swaring."
5,Had no faith the money would pay off...but then....,"My allergies are just a constantly slight annoyance since moving to Texas. I'm always on the stuffy side...random sneeze attacks, drippy nose. I'm always breathing out of my mouth. My husband insisted we buy this filter, and I had no faith it would help at all, because I couldn't imagine a FAN basically could clear the air of whatever bothers me. However, this works. When I'm stuffy, I turn on the hepa filter, and within 20 minutes of it being on high, I can turn it to low because I will be able to breathe again through my nose. It just really cleans the air. This was worth the money. I bought it to make my husband happy, but now it has actually helped me. I hope other people try it to find relief."
4,Fast Delivery!!,"This is a nice book for the collectible enthusiast. There are many colorful illustrations of items of interest for the home. I would have appreciated a more detailed list of what collectibles are included in the book though. If prompt delivery is one of your criteria for ordering this is the book to get, and I would recommend it. Thank you!"
5,This will be my favorite book! Great pictures!,This book is full of full color photos. Presented very well! Looking forward to their next book!
5,cat tales with a twist,I love cat stories and especially short stories. All of the stories were well written and well selected. I reread Pharoh's Cat and several of the others.I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys cats and their fantasy all in one book.
2,dissapointed,I purchased this item based on ownership of previous saw. This new model does not begin to be as good as the original.
4,Music from County Clare,"Moher are (or were):• Noel O'Donoghue (flute & whistles)• Michael Queally (fiddle)• Pat Marsh (bouzouki)• Paul O'Driscoll (double bass)• John Moloney (bodhrán)• Liam Murphy (guitar & vocals)This is a very pleasant album of traditional Irish folk, mostly instrumental but with two songs. The arrangements are intelligent and musical, well above average. I particularly like Liam Murphy's voice, the bass adds an unusual but effective touch, and Pat Marsh's bouzouki playing also deserves mention: it's not flashy, but it's right.The booklet contains notes on all the tunes.I play this a lot. The total time is 49'42""."
2,Not a good buy.,"I have this tripod for just 3 months. I have used about 3 times. The head has come apart from the center post. It appears the head screwed into the center post and the grooves have stripped. It is going to cost me shipping plus an additional $3.50 to send it back for repair or replacement.Additionally, the tripod is steady if you use the hook at the bottom to hang your camera or gadget bag but make sure you tighten down the screw that holds the center post or it will wobble on you.I realize it's an inexpensive (cheap) tripod but just because it doesn't cost much doesn't mean it has to be made poorly. Buy it at your own risk."
5,The Best Value Tripod,"I recently purchased the Vivitar V-2400GX Video/Photo Tripod. When i opened the box it was a small but light tripod that was easy to carry. As soon as I get something i like to try it out so guess what! I un-did the clips and let the legs extend to a hight of 60"". It even has a bubble aligner so your sure you have the perfect video. There are lots of screws to hold the components in place so to turn the head you have to loosen the screw and then turn it. If your an ameteur or professional photographer and were looking for an inexpensive tripod here you go."
4,Not for the c.o.f dimmu fan,"This is what BM is, Full of hatred,anger,raw and cold.No happy ""lets frolic in a field of dandy-lions""keyboards that make you feel like your at grandmas house.Nor are there any emo,goth,mall core breakdowns or any sort of that nonsense.Check this out if your into the real deal,you wont be disappointed."
2,"Okay, but...","This was my 2nd LCD TV I have bought. The TV comes with many cables so you don't need to buy any. The picture quality is fair. In my opinion it is too, too bright. I noticed on basketball games and hockey games that the playing surface made the whole picture lighter. I tried to adjust it with a video calibration disc but I could not get it to improve. I also didn't like the MS response time of 30mm is way to slow. I f you are watching and active program, sporting event, or news with moving banner at the bottom of the screen you will notice how distorted it will look."
2,Review of Hebrew for Dummies,"I have purchased a number of Dummy books and have found them quite useful. Then I bought this book without making a close examination of it. Big mistake. I have 2 major problems with it.1 - In chapter one it briefly covers the Hebrew alphabet and the pronunciation of consonants and vowels. That's it! No more Hebrew in the rest of the book. Everything is transliterated. I can understand the use of transliterations for Japanese or Chinese since they have thousands of different kanji's. But, Hebrew has only 22 letters in its alphabet! This one factor made the book worthless to me.2 - No where in the book does it say what is being said on the CD. I have no idea! Is he saying, ""How are you?"" Maybe, ""Is it raining?""On the plus side, the book has a lot of useful information about Israel, customs, etc. But as a language book I would never recommend it."
4,I like this book and I found the CD very useful,This is a great starting point for a person who is just starting to learn Hebrew. This is the first book you should get if you don't know any Hebrew. The CD and examples are very good because it does help a lot with the pronunciation.I'm glad I bought this book as my first book but I wish it taught more about reading Hebrew and learning the letters.
2,transliteration central!,"This book doesn't focus upon the Jewish alphabet or the words as written in that alphabet. It's good for vocabulary and whatnot, but not if you want to learn Hebrew to use in a synagogue without transliteration, or to read texts in Israel, or to read the original translations of the Hebrew Bible...or, or, or. I've put it down and enrolled in an actual Hebrew class. If transliteration is what you're looking for, it's probably a great way to go."
1,Learning language is an investment,Learning language is an investment. If you seriously want to learn a new language and it happens to be very different from English the best thing you can do is save up your money and buy Rosetta Stone and some books to help you learn better.
1,A heavy book with travel style topics,"I really like the ""for Dummies"" series, however, this volume does not fulfill my expectations. The chapters focus on practical sentences in Hebrew, however they are not so practical that you can use as a traveller guide and not so good that you can learn some hebrew.Also, but for the first chapter, it does not deal with hebrew characters. Just with english transliteration.I think it was a loss of money."
2,Confusing and error-prone,"I picked this book up at the Library after having studied Hebrew via Pimsleur, Rosetta Stone and several other printed books. I immediately began to notice inconsistencies in transcription and spelling that confused me, and before I had completed the first chapter I put it down.I have no doubt the author means well - and the cultural information is interesting - but Hebrew is a highly complex language and consistency is critical for a beginning learner, at whom this book is aimed."
2,hebrew for dummies,Do not buy this book if you want to learn to read Hebrew. Nowhere in the book is the Hebrew alphabet used. The cover of the book is very misleading.I was very disappointed.
2,Worst Hebrew Tutorial Ever,"If you do not have any knowledge of the language, this might give you a leg up in VERY basic volcabulary. If you have ever taken any Hebrew course, or lived there, visited there, or even just heard the language being spoken around you, DO NOT buy this book. It is absolutely horrible; there is no spelling in Hebrew, only minimal explanation of the Hebrew alphabet, horrific breaches in the normal English spelling of many Hebrew words, and no real explanation of anything. Go for Pimsleur, Barron's Mastering Hebrew, or a course at your local community collage; this book is the worst $20 you'll ever spend. Avoid at all costs.**EDIT** for some reason, it show 2 stars: while I would prefer negative stars, that is not an option. I do not, I stress, DO NOT willingly give this book any stars. Worst Book Ever Written."
2,not what expected,"i bought this book in a bookstore, where it was wrapped up so i couldn't look inside. i wanted to learn to speak and understand hebrew, since when i was little i learned how to fluently read the hebrew, but had very little vocabulary taught besides what we studied in the torah.i have been to israel, and i know the basic phrases, so wandering around, i know what the ""sher-oo-teem"" is when i see a sign in hebrew, so i dont' understand how this book is made for tourists. you wouldn't be able to recognize the male or female restrooms. they don't write out the english pronounciations of hebrew words. so going to israel equipped with just the vocabulary but not the alphabet would be the same as just knowing english.and really, even if you don't learn to read hebrew fluently, there's still words that you would be able to recognize just by looking for them."
3,Good beginners' book,This is a good book for the beginner. The only problem I have with it is that it shows the transliteration of Hebrew whereas I would have also liked the book to show the actual Hebrew text.
2,Conversational Only,"Don't expect to learn anything about the written language. There are also inconsistencies in the romanized spelling of certain terms. These are easy to identify, but annoying nonetheless."
4,Hebrew for Dummies,Guess I must be a bigger dummy than most as it lacks some of the most important things to help you learn more. Needs some more background on how to use the sentences and some of the ways to do things that would make it easier to use. Most of it is easy to understand for the most part but there are some things that I could not quite get the hang of no matter what I did. Just not quite complete enough to be able to learn the way you need to in order to be able to understand and speak it and/or read it as well. Good starter but needs more so you can understand better. I would recommend it for a first book on it but then you need someone that can help you with what is missing.
3,Threads are clear and smooth,"It's a stepdown ring. The threads are smooth and clear, no grabbing or binding on either side. I do find it odd that Adorama is letting someone else sell a product with their name attached, though."
3,62mm to 58mm filter adapter,Does what it is intended for but causes vignetting at wide end of lens. I expected this so am not disappointed.
3,Not really purple! More like Fuschia!,"I received these really quickly from the seller. However, previous reports are correct when they said these aren't really purple....more like a fuschia. even the color coating looks more like fuschia than purple. They may want to change the description. Going to try painting them to get the purple color. I think the low wattage will allow for glass paint without scorching."
3,nothing like i thought they were going to be,"well, i thought this was going to be wonderful for a cheap price. i was expecting purple light bulbs. turns out they are basicly pink with a pinch of purple. the other bad thing for me is that they are very dim. i got 5 total to fit in my 5 socket lamp. the light barely reaches the other side of my adverage size room and thats with all 5. so they are good for mood lights and if you desire dim, pink with a touch of purple lights they should be right up your ally. for me they're just ok, but the good thing is they are cheap and it only cost me $7.09 all together."
1,Does not work,This thing doesn't work at all!!!!!!THE AD WAS MISLEADING!!!! It sells you the same product twice ie.----Frequently Bought TogetherCustomers who bought Ab Sonic Belt also buy ABSONIC Belt by SonicAbs --Price For Both: $47.94ITS THE SAME CRAPPY PRODUCT UNDER TWO NAMES!!!
1,Ab Sonic EMS Fitness Belt,I really think I wasted money for buying this stuff.....it's just worthless and not working at all.
2,a waste,worked for a week and worked good for that week but it stopped workin changed battery still didnt work so i went back to crunches and pushups at 530am
1,DO Not Buy,"Don't not waste your money, take the reviews seriously. The item never even came on. And don't buy from FAMILY VIDEO ever!They take money for a product they know doesn't work and never provide any form of customer service. You will be robbed! If not by the sellers of this defective product but by the defective product itself."
1,A Waste,"A waste of money and a waste of time. That said, the delivery was prompt and it arrived in the expected condition. Just a case of ""curiosity killed the cat."""
4,Absonic works well. wears out,"ABSONIC BeltThe belt works pretty well for the low price. It definitely exercises the muscles and runs which ever program and intensity you want.The buttons stick sometimes. I wore out my first one, so I bought 2 more. I was rough with it and a button fell out.The amount of area covered by the belt is decent, but it would be nice if it was larger. You need to move it to another area and run it again.Bruce"
1,Useless,"product had a different box to the other item i bought but same inside, more expensive and done absolutely nothing but left me with a huge postage and handling bill wich was 4 times the price of the item shipped to australia. never shopping on here again."
1,DO NOT BUY,Don't buy this piece of junk. I just recieved it today thinking wow this is going to be great! Little did I know that it would leave me with skin burns... It says be generous with the amount of gel... I put enough to cover the entire surface the first time. No reaction. Then I emptied the rest of the bottle onto the pad and onto my stomach. I began to feel comfortable contractions for about a minute but then it started to hurt. It was a tingling sensation at first but then I just wanted to rip the belt off. This is the worst product ive ever tried... I think the most valuable thing in the box was the freaking batteries!
1,HORRIBLE!,"This product does not work. While it was ""working out"" my stomach, it actually burned it. Never used it again. I do not recommend it!"
3,So far it has been working,"I am not totally confident that it will work forever as other reviews suggest. Definitely, it is not going to give you amazing abs as one can think. I have been using with a fair intensity for a month but I do not see results. You feel it but you do not see it. Probably it needs more time."
1,"Horrible Company, broken product","Sent me a broken piece of equipment did not work right out of the box, tried contacting them both ways given. They have a phone number that automatically puts you on hold when you call, no automated voice that lets you select what you are calling for at all, just the hold music. No one picked up, sat on the phone literally waiting for 45 minutes with no one picking up. I watched an entire tv show waiting for this. Tried emailing them twice with no response, Amazon even responded reminding me that I had sent an email to them but the company did no such thing. All I wanted was an exchange, not even a refund, just so I could get a working belt. This company is completely shady with no customer support at all, never ever buy from them because you will never be able to contact anyone in case something goes wrong."
1,The item broke after 1 use.,"While this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application/session use of 20 min, the second time I tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min. Even after getting new batteries (which turned out NOT to be the problem) I tried to get the belt to work like before but realized I was ""scammed"". It is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones."
1,Peice Of Junk!,I reveived this item promply and was really excited about it! I guess you get what you pay for because this item was a peice of Junk. It never worked from day one and it was flimsey and not well constructed. I decided insted of complaining and spending $$ to return it that I would just take the loss and trash it where it should have been from the beginning!
1,Bad idea,Okay so trying to get fit the cheat way is bad. i felt tingling pain for weeks after only seconds of use. That was with the low setting with the whole tube of lube. How sad.
1,Stoped functioning after 4 uses,"Works well whwn it wirks! It stopped working after 4 uses. Not the batteries, the control still works. Looks like the pad do not transmit energy anymore. I do not know what to do. I do not have papers or box anymore. Is it covered by garanty?Andrew"
2,do you know what gel to use?,"I bought this belt a while ago but could not use it, because I have no idea what gel I should get for it. It says a water based gel or water. Water definitelly does not work. Could anyone tell me specifically what gel I need and where I could buy it?Ignore my rating since I did not actually used the belt.Thank you."
1,where's the product?,"I received a phone msg. from the vendor two days after I ordered this item from Amazon. A day after I received an email advising that they could not ship my order to a california address, and if I had another address outside California to ship it to. I thought it was strange since I only have one address. I was looking forward to geting this item too..."
5,Recipient loved the gift basket!,The recipient moved into a new home and the company sent this gift basket! The recipient loved it!Settling In: Housewarming Gift Basket
4,Sandwich plates,The Signature's Sorrento Metal Plate Caddy and plates are very useful for those before dinner treats.
3,Stacked second side,"3 1/2While outshined by many of their jam band peers where it matters, UM demonstrate, if on less occasion than what would be required for full engagement, the ability to hungrily implement seasoned studio interplay on top of fruitful songwriting."
4,better once youve heard it live,"but there are so many tracks that are so much better live. dont get me wrong, i love this cd, but it dosent compare to live versions of most of the songs. all of the songs are great, but when played live, even when they arent jammed on are just better than whats on the cd. for instance, uncle wally on this cds okay but not as good as it is live and when its played electric.all in all a great album. nothing too fancy and white mans moccosins are still some of my favorite um songs even with all their new stuff out"
5,local band does super,"This is the best band that you may have never heard of. I love this CD, all of the songs are great. I especially enjoy Nothing Too Fancy, it's like tripping balls at the Kentucky Derby! While this CD is great, the true beauty of Umphrey's McGee is the live shows."
3,"not great, but works","wasnt what i expected. it works, but the quality isnt that great. i guess its meant to used casually only."
3,Disapointed.,"In order for me to use this mic I need to hold it less then 12 inches away from my mouth. I was disapointed but luckily I only spent 14 dollars on it so it wasnt too big of a loss. BTW, I did change all my mic setting to max its volume and even tried Mic boost but nothing.I've had no luck with desktop mics and I'm thinking my best bet would be a mic headset."
4,Works fine,Seems to work like a microphone should. I bought this one because it was inexpensive and plugs into the actual mic jack - NOT USB. People can hear me and I can record fine.
5,good,microphone works great and I am glad I got the one with mic jack and not USB since my USB ports are really full. Works nice and clear.
2,noise,I had to get so close to mine to hear myself that when I didI couldn't get rid of wind sound form my breath.
1,Doesn't work,I have no idea why but I tried to use this on both my desktop computer and laptop and it does not work. I can't hear it play back to me. I tried sound recording and it doesn't respond. My friend on another end heard nothing.I don't know why it won't work for me but will for others. So buy at your own risk. Don't buy it brand new or you may waste alot of money.
1,Worked for a week,"Bought this on amazon, it worked for a week then the flimsy microphone disconnected from the base. I looked around and found a Labtec Verse-514 desk microphone for alot cheaper, again on amazon. Bought that and have been using it for years."
1,"Don't buy it, use something else","I really recommend you to go and find something else. This is not something good to use. I bought it myself and just wasted money. You can, of course, try it yourself and tell us your story but to me it didn't work well."
2,It is not the products which is shown in the picture,"While making the purchase, it shows the Desktop Microphine with Earphones but I got only the Mic which can take the input. There was no earphone where in i can get the sound Output.I dont know if I was sent a wrong item or what."
1,I don't know what should I say here...... :(,"Its a mistake of Amazon or Tech Depo. The image shown in add is different from the product. Actualy the product is correct as par the Heading. But the image is misleading, due to that I thought its a headphone with mic and ordered for 2. When I opened the package its something different. So I am unable to give review on this, Guys be sure while buying this product, its the same thing that you wanted to buy.Now I am facing problem how to return this, if I am returning it then loosing $8 which I gave for shipping and handling. Hope this will give clear idea while buying this product.Actualy I shouln't have given any start here, but form is not allowing me to submit so I am putting 1 start."
1,Microphone,I purchased this mircrophone online..when I received it I threw away the packaging assuming it would work...IT DID NOT...Ive tried contacting amazon and have gotten no response on how to send this product back..I am EXREMELY dissappointed with amazon and with this product...I rated this ONE star only because I had to rate it something..0 wasnt an option!!
1,UNa basura,This mic is a piece of trash ...I bougth it and you have to shout to be listened..es una completa basura y una perdida de recursos.
1,I should have been good,"I purchased this microphone monthes ago but it never reached me.the profoct was supposed to be shipped from ANTonline stores via Fedex, but the product never made it to me.So ANTonline never refunded altough they said they did, and Fedex said that the shippment was reciceved by the buyer successfully (who was supposed to be me). but i never got the microphone.So i do not know which part of the chain sucked...ANTonline or Fedex, but i know one thing, when i want to purchase a product and i see either of these two names i will instantly refrain from buying it.."
2,It's worth to spend the extra cash.,"The only decent thing about this mic is that it looks alright and is easy to use. However, I usually had to keep the mic directly next to my mouth in order to be heard and the quality wasn't that great. The base of it is also very light so it moves around easily and often tips over. I'd highly suggest the Logitech USB Desktop Mic, which I've also used, and is much better for less than $10 more."
2,Disgusting,"This book is digusting. One of the reviewers says ""this is what makes gay men gay"". Ay mi Dios! It's more like ""this is why society hates us"". Two men with no restraint or reserve, who will do anybody anywhere. The weirder or kinkier the better. Out in public, no concern for their HIV+ status.It is scary to think that some gay men operate this way. I could barely finish the book did but and will now throw in the trash as I don't want anyone else to read this."
1,Huh?!?,"A friend passed me this book and said with resignation,""Here. I give up. Since you work in the comic industry,you may have better luck with this."" I read the blurbs onthe cover: 'FUNNIEST COLLECTION OF STORIES!','FILLED WITH WIT!', 'PROVOKE WHOOPS OFLAUGHTER!''I was blown away', 'Knee-slapping good time','Wonderfully crafted'... the readers gushed.So I settled down to read it.And man, I don't know how the accolades came about butnone of the stories made sense or even produced a tinysnigger from me. There was one tale about some kidskilling their mum. One about a wife seeing a ghost.Another on a fat, clumsy woman. But they all werethe same: ultra-badendings.I want my time back.PS: The one star is for the beautiful cover!"
3,"An excellent writer, a mixed bag.","Collection of short storiesAfter finishing 1Q84, I needed a bit of a palate cleanser and this did the trick. The writing was tight, the subject matter was confronting, the stories were polished.As with all anthologies, some appealed more than others but they were all worthwhile to various degrees. They tended to be acerbic, bittersweet, tragi-comedies that showcased empty lives with a cynical bite.There is a skill to presenting sharp characterisation in a small slice-of-life and this author pulls it off with a well crafted collection. (But, for me, it is not in the same category as my favourite by her, The Writing Class)"
4,"An engaging foray into life, death, and humor","Funny as in ""huh"" rather than a knee-slapping good time, Jenny and the Jaws of Life is simply a fantastic collection of short stories. Dark and cynical at times (most times, in fact), it's thought-provoking while still being somewhat glib and breezy. Willett is a great talent and I'm so happy this collection is still being offered (or is being offered again, as the case may be)."
5,Amazing Collection,"I was never a big fan of short story collections until I picked up Jenny and the Jaws of Life. It's quickly become one of my favorite books of all time (right up there with A Widow for One Year and Mother Night). The stories in it are dark, bizarre and funny. I liked it so much I bought two copies.After I lent out the first and it was never returned I was more careful. But now the second one's lost as well. I wanted to read the stories again, so I recently bought three copies; two for lending, one for keeping (just to be on the safe side)."
4,funny,"I loved this book. People who dont get it, dont get it because they dont get most things. It is a truly funny book, we all know these characters."
2,Pale by comparison,I am a General Contracter in MD. I've owned several Dewalt drills. One old 12v was left on the driveway and run over by a Chevy Suburban and still runs beautifully. However the 18v is the opposite. We have gone through two batterys and was told at the dewalt center they wear out faster. At 14 months the clutch failed and I was told when replacing the clutch the chuck had to be replaced as well. The tool has cost me 250.00 excluding the purchase price. Using several drills on the jobsite the Big Panasonic eats the competition for lunch. The battery lasts 3 to 4 times as long. Better balance. Better tool.
1,New Bosch cordless system is much better.,I have burned up four DeWalt cordless drills on the job. I like the DeWalt color but not performance.I just saw the new Bosch cordless system at the Hardware Show. What an improvement. The Bosch cordless line seemed much more durable.Panasonic cordless also outlasts DeWalt on the job.
4,"Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Harvard University","This is another in the ""Cities Through Time"" series, which provides an excellent resource in middle school. The text is informative and interesting, and covers briefly, but adequately, the history, culture and people of Iraq. The layout is very appealing. --Teaching Resource Center of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University."
4,Cute sneaker,"Very comfortable soles, great for standing as they stay comfortable for extended lengths of time. I have narrow heels and find that the rub a little when walking if my socks are thin but this is a pretty specific problem that I have with most shoes (probably not their fault). Very comfortable and I get lots of compliments on them."
2,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","Collection of essays by Belgrade-based writers claiming to be representative of the anti-war opposition throughout the former Yugoslavia. The contributors' partisan airing of Serb-nationalist grievances makes them more representative, however, of (most of) the non-regime intelligentsia in Serbia alone"
2,Ugh.,I been brought this a while ago. But when i got it there was an item missing. The medal rods were missing to keep the dock in place. They sent me a dock with suction cups -_- I was too lazy to send it back so I just kept it. which I regret
2,Turtles will eat this dock!!,"It worked well for a couple of months, but then my turtle started to chomp on it. I bought another one hoping my turtle would not eat this one as well, but I was wrong. It is also annoying to clean up all the small pieces after the turtle has eaten and secreted them."
2,"Ok, but not sure how safe it is","I recently brought home a baby turtle and this was the first dock I bought. At first the dock seemed fine, he liked to bask on it. After a few weeks though he started to eat the dock. He's just a tiny baby and ate a huge chunk of it off. I initially thought maybe he could smell the food that was placed onto it and if I bought a new one he would stop. Well, he didn't. Even a brand new one with no food placed onto it he ate. It's been a few weeks now and he seems to be healthy still but I definatly don't recommend this dock for that reason. Also, I ended up breaking it after the suction cup would not come off when I tried to clean the tank. It broke one of the legs in half so the dock was not stable. I guess it did its job of allowing him to bask, but between the eating and breaking this would not be my first choice."
1,This dock killed my turtle,"Avoid this dock if you have a smallish turtle. My red eared slider got caught behind the bars and died in the middle of the night. I took this back to the pet store. The concept is nice and I'm sure it works in most situations, but I guess we were unlucky. But logically you can see how those bars could be deadly to a smaller turtle."
2,Not Cheap But Made Cheaply,"I've had one of these mid-size docks for my smaller turtle for a couple of years. The suction cups are totally useless, so I rigged up a way to secure it without them. After a couple of years the underside of the thing started crumbling.I've wondered if the foam stuff that breaks off is toxic to my turtle, so I keep it out of the tank, but everytime I clean it, more falls off. Call it the ""disappearing turtle dock"". Makes me re-think Zoo Med products altogether, because these are not cheap, but they are made cheaply."
5,BIG JEFF ROCKS FOR KIDS,"My family has known Big Jeff for about 6 years though birthday parties and local New Jersey shows. We have 5 of his CD's and I'm always looking for more. Big Jeff is like Raffi and The Wiggles rolled into one. His CD Big Jeff II is our favorite but we love every one of them. Buy all of his CD's, trust me, you will be singing it all day long."
5,MOM CEO - I am a CEO and Your are a CEO!,"This book is awesome! I just got my copy and could not put it down. It is so down to earth and an easy read. As a busy mom I want books that get to the point. I was thrilled to find it is filled with recipes and tips you will want to use again and again.It covers child birth, breastfeeding, potty training, reading skills, age appropriate tips, gifted children, and working at home. As a WORK-AT-HOME mom I loved this book.My daughter is expecting a new baby and I will pass it onto to her as well. It will make a great gift for any new mom."
2,not that great,OK plot OK writing but nothing new to be seen here. Regular old fast-written stuff with none of the skill and longevity of the greats - I'm thinking Le carre etc. Get working on the next one Mr Berenson if you're seriously aiming to get up there with the best of them.
2,"Get the bad guy, save the country, get the girl. Simple really...","I kid you not! The title of this review is actually an excerpt from page 427. Here's the entire paragraph...Get the bad guy, save the country, get the girl. Simple really. ""Yeah, I'm right on track,"" he said aloud to an empty room.Is this the protagonist reassuring himself, or the author reassuring himself? I've read ""literature"" that had worse problems than this book, but c'mon Mr. Berenson...there's no need to poke fun at us for reading your book."
4,Fun and forgettable,"Fun and forgettable - although certainly nothing special as far as writing goes, the book mostly carries a good pace and is great for the beach, a plane ride, or just lounging around. I'll be buying the next in the series, although more as a filler than with any great anticipation. My main reason for writing this review is - AMAZON, THE KINDLE VERSION is simply ATROCIOUS as far as PUNCTUATION goes, and seems to get worse as you head towards the end of the book. Ort o be,more specific itget sdistractinga nd annoying. FIX IT PLEASE. After getting the Kindle this xmas (2010) I've found this to be a recurring problem - cmon, how hard is it to use a spell checker? Inexcusable."
5,So Good!!!!!!!!,"I picked this novel up in an airport bookshop recently and boy, am I ever glad that I did. This book was addictive, engrossing, suspenseful in the extreme, very well written with marvellous plot and character development. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who loves topical thrillers. Absolutely fantastic, and I look forward to reading more of Mr Berenson's novels. He is a great find!"
3,Excitement: medium. Conclusion: Absurd.,"I've noticed a number of Muslim readers sending in negative reviews because, let's face it, the Bad Guys in this book are Muslim.I have no problem with a novel about the West versus Al-Qaeda, but I did have some other problems with this book. The biggest problem was that the protagonist (Jalal) was simply not believable, and neither was his self-enforced isolation from his employer, the CIA. I also found it Risky Business to show Jalal as a convert to Islam, who still maintained his hostility to Al-Qaeda.But the book became downright silly at the end, when suddenly Jalal's girlfriend jumped into action, and the two of them managed to bring down two massive terror plots within twelve hours, despite being shot and being infected by bio-war bacteria.I mean, really!? You want to stop a dirty bomb, so you just start walking down the street waiting for the man driving it to happen along??"
4,It reminds me of...,"More than 40 years ago I was enthralled reading a first novel by an, at the time, unknown writer John Le Carre. It was called The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. I had a similar response to The Faithful Spy. Strangely, although I didnt know it at the time, I intuited that this was a first novel by Mr. Berenson.The similarities between these two brilliant novels are more in the line of style and character development rather than plot. In both books the protagonist leads a lonely existence and is unsure of both his own agency and the enemy he is sent to infiltrate. In contrast to high testosterone content of many spy novels this one has an emotional content that is subdued, almost tragicaly sad but just as imapctful. There is plenty of action but it is subordinate to the competing ideologies and conflicting relationships that grip the reader. Ultimately it's a story about trust which reflects a modern dilemma that is unfortunately part of our lives."
2,Ambitious but without direction,"Written by a more than competent reporter, this book takes on the inevitable question of what a US sleeper among al-Qaeda would look like, but barring that premise, develops nowhere. Berenson is at home with his observations of the conflict between America and Islam, but when he inserts philosophical analysis over his observations, we get a comfortably liberal re-interpretation of the same ideas that our president tells us via his speeches. In the end, every character is a stereotype, and each is defective and learns nothing, plus the ""mystery"" and ""suspense"" aspects are lacking thanks to a linear plot."
2,A novel with creepy protagonists,"""The Faithful Spy"" should be read for its detailed research, which is excellent. The novel itself, however, is deeply flawed and ultimtely silly. The main flaw is that the chief protagonist, John Wells, is a creep who, in cold blood, murders men who trust him. The whole book is filled with creeps, including John Wells' love interest, Jen, who deliberately lost her virginity in a foolish, ugly way. You will have a very hard time suspending disbelief in this overly complex and sadisticly violent plot."
2,Unhappy,"As your record will show, I have purchased many books for my Kindle, which I purchased thru amazon. The kindle unit is over two years old, and needs a new battery. I have contacted amazon/kindle/help regarding this problem. I spent long periods of time with each attempt, going thru the automatic phone menus and sitting on hold. Each time I spoke to someone in India, who I had difficulty understanding. Each time they tried to help me by talking me thru a maze of instructions to search out the answer to the problem. I have a hearing impairment, and I do not work for you. All I asked for was where to send the kindle unit to be fixed, and how much will it cost. In the mean time I have essentially given up and gone back to a book in the hand without any batteries........."
1,"Great Premise, Good Start, Okay Middle, Terrible End","The first 75 pages were quite entertaining. Unfortunately, the book then devolved into the usual dreck that has been churned out since Tom Clancy hit it big twenty-some years ago.Where have you gone Mr Le Carre? The reading public turns their lonely eyes to you."
1,The Dullest Spy Book Ever Written!,"""The Faithful Spy"" is the dullest spy book ever written. It was hard to get through the thing, which read like that long, long textbook you hated in college. There are a few interesting and timely plot elements, but the author lacks the craft and creativity necessary to bring them to life. The ""hero"" is a cardboard cutout that we never really get to know. You'd be better off with a few episodes of ""24"" than this over-rated waste of time. And how many of you are sick of the book companies' new rip-off of charging $9.99 instead of $7.99 for a paperback that is a little taller, but full of white space on every page?"
3,Great Story Unlikeable Characters,"I am a consumer of spy thrillers. I read 'em like I eat popcorn and cast them all as movies in my head. I have no special background knowledge or experience in the subject matter; I just like these ""modern westerns"" from writers such as Flynn, Thor, and now Berenson. I have read the first three John Wells novels. This was the best by far. After the second one, I realized that none of the characters is a likeable person. Even John Wells can't get himself together to reach out to his only child and Jennifer is worse in the family honor department. Duto is just creepy and lacks complexity. I supposed Berenson doesn't want any of them to be admirable or likeable. I like Vince Flynn's people; they're far more complex. Only Ellis Schaeffer is really intriguing, so far."
4,Commentary on Berenson's Faithful Spy,"Length:: 2:49 MinsBerenson has one book that is pretty good and one book that is not so good. Want to know why? In this short video review I'll explain why one is so much less than the other. No re-hash of the plot, no re-telling of the story, just some plain analysis. -- Frank Derfler author of A Glint in Time [...]"
3,a little disappointing,"After hearing that this book won the Edgar award, I had my hopes up. However, it didn't really live up to them. Basically, the novel is a workable, standard spy thriller. We have heroic misunderstood leading man, cowardly bureaucrats, love interest, and bad guys wanting to destroy America. The book is fast-paced, and what saves it from being just typical is the protagonist- I loved it that Berenson made his hero very complex--although a loyal American, he has converted to Islam while being a mole inside Al Qaeda, and has conflicting feelings about the country he's fighting for. I enjoyed the read but didn't think it was quite worth the hype."
2,The Boring Spy,"Some of the previous reviewers are either shills for the publisher, or somehow reviewed the wrong book. The book was not badly written; I would say the author has some promise.However, if you are looking for an action thriller in the pattern of Vince Flynn or Brad Thor, you will be sadly dissapointed. This book is unbeleivably slow, and the main characters spend more time agonizing over their own faults, the faults of their agency, their co-workers, and their country than doing anything about terrorists. After reading it, one might come to the conclusion that Radical Islam would be doing us all a favor if they just got it over with and blasted everyone int he USA off the face of the earth.90% of the action in this book happens in the last 5% prose. If I like a book even marginally, i'm one who is likely to read the rest of the books in the series or the authors other offerings..but in this case, I will pass."
4,Deeper than deep and on your own!,"Excellent debut novel for Mr. Berenson. Written in the vain of Vince Flynn and Lee Chile, John Wells, the books protagonist, needs to get a little meaner if he wants to run with big dogs Mitch Rapp or Jack Reacher! Very good thesis. The deep cover angle as an American who penetrates al Qaeda is excellent and could have been developed more from the ""how to"" perspective. Weaving in the actual al Qaeda leadership was done well. One of the best parts of the novel was the discussion of what is and what is not torture, and how that definition is applied to today's hardcore terrorists. Good thought provoking analysis.All in all I thought Alex Berenson did a great job of both character and plot development. If John Wells is to continue in the shadow of a Mitch Rapp he has got to toughen up a bit. But hey, years as a deep undercover al Qaeda operative in Afghanistan is tough enough. Good Job and I am looking forward to the next Berenson book."
2,Hard to be faithful to this spy,"I found the writing turgid, the plot predictable. The characters lacked dimension. Skipped chunks because it was not that fun to read, but I did want to find out what happened in the end, just a little."
5,Interesting Thriller,"John Wells is a CIA operative, posing as an Al-Queda terrorist, plotting against American armed forces in Afghanistan. His wife and son have left him due to his dedication to the eradication of terrorist activity against the USA. After many years in Afghanistan, Wells returns to US soil in search of Khadri, a Pakistani Islamic extremist who intends on ridding the world of as many infidels as possible.I have been busy lately, so I have not been able to read this page turner at a pace more pleasing to me. Believe me when I say it is fast paced and intense. It will keep you guessing up to the last page."
2,Watch out for those olive-skinned people!,"This was not the page-turner that was advertised. It's very predictable and stodgy in places. I had to force myself to finish the book.Berenson displays and propagates his prejudices:Almost every Arab or Muslim character is a terroristAlmost every Muslim meets a violent end.Government surveillance, detainment and torture are not only justified, but absolutely necessary.If you are not already suspicious of every Arab and Muslim that you see, you will be by the end of the book.There's nothing new here, just more stereotyping and inciting hatred of an already much-maligned minority group. I'm sure there will be a movie very soon."
3,not as expected,"this is working ok, its just that i thought is was chrome but its really just plastic feeling, the price is ok and at that price i shouldn't expect more. i have no problem with the way it works though, actually would buy again at the price."
3,It's car wash. It smells good,"I like to buy quality stuff, even if it costs more. I am not sure if this is better than other car washes or not. I will probably buy it again because I like Pinnacle stuff. When it comes down to it....It's car wash. It smells good."
3,No Improvements,"This unit does skip quite alot. The navigation is unacceptable, with it being strictly numeric, albums show as a number and track show as a number.Not good with close to 200 songs on a cd. ALso, how about a 10+ skip forward funtion? Would that have been to difficult?Also, Philips' site says it comes with a belt clip: It doesn't.Also, no remote.I will say, the overall sound is as good as I've heard on a portable player. Just not good enough to overecome the deficiencies."
1,Yeeech,"The EXP201 should be avoided unless you plan to use it as a desktop model and you get it for next to nothing. Want to jog? Prepare for audio torture: The skipping is atrocious, even with the apparently useless ESP feature on. I returned one for speeding up (think chipmunks) about halfway through some discs. The replacement does this as well. Also, I now note poor scratchy sound at the very beginning of most discs. The sound is OK when these problems aren't in effect. The MP3 labeling system is a joke, just numbers and no way to skip ahead by more than one."
2,"Don't bother with this - get the EXP103, but do read on.","The 201 is an attractive compact model, but...I have owned 2 model EXP103 for about 1 year and they have terrific sound, no skipping, and great 8-10 hour battery life. Unfortunately, the EXP201 I bought skipped and the same NiMH batts lasted about 4 hours. Also more spin/rotation noise than the earlier EXP103 model. I do think Philips has the best drive system, based on my experience and reviews. I have bought and returned a couple other brands recently. I should just give up and buy a RIO and maybe try the EXP301. [...]."
1,Terrible Product!!!,"I have owned Philips products in the past, including a stereo which is amazing quality! This MP3-CD Player is so terrible! The quality is so poor it is a total waste of my money, so I returned the product! It skips constatly, as in every seconds when I am walking with it in my pocket or bagpack. Some tracks it will not even play on mp3 data cd's I create on my computer. It won't display the title, only the number of the song which is a very poor feature. Also when I am walking with the unit it will sometime go crazy and start playing another track while I am listening to the current one. This unit is poor and I would not recommend it to anyone!"
4,"Very good, few problems","I found this to be a solid mp3 player with all features working as promised. I don't use the resume feature, so i don't know about any problems with it, but i had no problems with sound quality or skipping. I did have a problem getting ""easy"" cd creator to preserve the correct file ordering, but then i started burning my cd's with nero, and my problem disappeared, so i don't think this is a problem with the cd player. The only quirks i found is that sometimes it doesnt find all of the mp3s on the cd, and the base boost is a little flat compared to other players. Also, it's (...) expensive."
3,i m irritated lately with this product.,i was happy to have this discman. but lately it is giving me some problems. whenever i try to change the title or new song it goes back to the 1st song and i cant play the song i want to but i have to start listening to song from the 1st one.any one to solve my problem.
1,Never again,"My kids recieved 2 expanium mp3 players for Christmas, they are now both in the trash because they wouldn't play, they would only read 'oops' on the digital display.With only about 10 to 30 hours play time my daughters' gave out, my sons' held out for about twice as long. One bright note on the car adapter kit supplied, they work excelent with my 6 year old, been everywhere, beat up, abused Sony CD player."
2,Bad! Bad! Bad!,"What are BAD player, even EXP103 is better than it. Stupid anti-shock, alway skipping while walking, No problem on SP50, Casio PZ5000 and TDK Mojo. ok, skipping, annoying, It skips wonderfully will do mix songs (When I llisten to dance music while walking, it will mix up another track music into my ear. pre-LOAD the wrong track for anti-skip.) Oh my god, Willie Nelson sings a song with Mcdonna (Sometimes Chinese singer sing with Lee Ann), this player done a good job, I have never think they have a song together.No good with no navigation screen.what's good, batteries life, sound quality (When you non activitely). Riovolt SP50 SP90, with no good sounding. didn't try SP250 and SP480.wasted my $."
5,Cost Saver,"I combine this step-down ring with a 49-58mm step-up ring and a 58mm filter, to enable the use of the 58mm Circular Polarizer and dedicated lens hoods on my lenses that take 49mm filters. This enables me to save the expense of a circular polarizing filter for my 49mm filter-thread lenses.It won't work on my lenses wider than 35mm because the hoods clamp onto 49mm filters, but for everything else, it's a great solution. I can still use my lens hoods and save some money on filters.(lens) --> (49-to-58mm ring) --> (58mm filter) --> (58-to-49mm ring) --> (49mm lens hood)"
5,"Mack Maloney's ""Wingman"" series in the 1930s","Admittedly it requires familiarity with the board game series it's based on to make total sense--especially with all the airplanes mentioned in it--but it's a thoroughly enjoyable tale of dogfighting, greed, and vengeance over the skies of an alternate 1937 Seattle. The setting is evocative of Mack Maloney's ""Wingman"" series, but more from the point of view of the people who prefer and enjoy the balkanization of the USA rather than the people who want to restore it."
5,One of my favorite books of all time!,"Dandelion Wine is a wonderful, nostalgic trip down memory lane. Bradbury brings back those warm childhood summers when all you had to worry about was being home before dark. It is also a coming of age story. A beautiful narrative that describes those first moments when a young boy realizes that he is not immortal, that someday he will die. Bradbury has created one of the most beautiful works I have ever had the fortune to read. I heartily reccomend it to anyone!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I can understand and always understood why serious racing entusiasts looking for real power gains won't look twice at this but even small me, an amature feels like I wasted my money. I have experienced not one ounce of observable power gain by installing this."
1,Targus Cho70 PDA/Handheld Leather Universal Case,"This case is not universal! The case description should be explicitly defined for the various PDA's. I do not have a clue who is responsible for the description, but the IQue 3600, by Garmin is a very common PDA and GPS system that has a flip up antenna on the back side. The Targus case requires two velcro patches be attached to the PDA. The first patch blocks the use of the antenna and the second patch will not permit the PDA to be put into its mobile or charging cradles. In short, the Targus patch system simply does not work for Garmin PDA's. The description of the case on this page should include the former."
4,Something for everyone,"This book is a great of blend of practical, hands-on advice and a larger, more spiritual perspective. Personally, I like the tangible stuff (to-do lists, worksheets, etc.), but I can see how this book can appeal to a whole range of people who are looking for ways to deal with their ""stuff."""
2,Getting organized,I found this book to be too superficial for my needs. I do not regret its purchase because to learn it was not going to give me info I needed was also important. I will pass it on to someone else.
3,Excellent tool kit with poor batteries.,I have been using the DeWalt cordless kit for well over a year in my home repair/remodeling business and I am now looking to replace the tools. Nothing wrong with the tools but the batteries are disappointing. I am considering other manufacturer's because of the batteries poor performance. The batteries do not hold a charge very long and will lose its charge in a few days even when not used. I purchased four additional batteries and the DeWalt radio so I can have at least two batteries fully charged and ready to go.
4,A decent set,"Overall, pretty impressed with this set. Drill has plenty of power, though I will say had to return first one because of faulty gearbox. Also, hammerdrilling tends to eat batteries fast (a little disappointing, but then again, hammerdrilling is tough on corded models too). Reciprocating saw is very nice, as is circ. saw (but I agree the safety is a bit awkward). Light is also very handy. If these units hold up for about 5 years I would rate them very highly - we'll see... (though I'm sure I'll need new batteries before that)."
4,Great Dewalt Cordless Set,"This is the best cordless set I have owned. The drill has plenty of power, even in concrete. It is heavy-duty and has stood up to several drops from a ladder. As with most 18 volt tools, it would be nice if it didn't weigh quite so much. The circular saw works great! The flashlight is powerful but I found the bulb to break easy. The reciprocating saw is the weakest link in my opinion. It works well but is difficult to run at low speeds. Because of this, I still prefer to use my corded Sawzall for some jobs. Overall, I would rate this kit as very good and highly recommend it."
1,Made in Mexico,"A word of warning before you spend your hard earned money on DeWalt tools. Black and Decker (they actually make DeWalt) recently moved the manufacturing of DeWalt tools from Easton, Maryland to Mexico. Most of the DeWalt tools being sold now were either manufactured in Easton after layoffs were announced or were made in the new Mexico facility. The facility has been riddled with problems from day one and may never produce the same quality tools as the Easton plant. Yes, every tool maker now manufactures outside the US, but DeWalt admittedly priced their tools higher because they could stamp ""Made in America"" on them. Now all they have is higher prices, a bright yellow case stamped ""Made in Mexico"". I am not telling anyone not to buy DeWalt, just sharing the truth."
5,Free from extension cords and then some...,"Cordless has come a long way! There is nothing like loading up the wheelbarrow with your tools and heading for the project in the back yard- without the extension cord. Hold onto the drill with both hands because is is loaded with torque. Speeds are easily controlled with three settings and variable speed. The hammerdrill portion works well and it is a 1/2"" drill! The circular saw is lightweight and reasonably powerful. It is so capable that I gave my electric circular saw away. The reciprocating saw is incredible. I have cut wood and metal with it and it leaves me shaking my head in disbelief- it works that well.As for longevity, we'll see. So far I am very impressed. Its tough to part with ...money to replace the electric tools you already own. It gets a lot easier, though, once the new tools have overwhelmingly impressed you. In case you can't tell, I am completely satisfied with these tools. Nice job DeWalt!"
3,Not Up to Porter-Cable Quality at the Same Price,"While the DeWalt Kit is satisfactory, it does not hold up well in comparison to the 19.2 volt Porter-Cable kit I replaced it with. First, the DeWalt is underpowered at 18 volts. Second, the Porter-Cable has a degree of durability not found in DeWalt - unfortunately, DeWalt continues to follow the trend of becoming more and more like their alternative line - Black & Decker - but at a premium price. Finally, the Porter-Cable tools are desiged to have a smaller footprint, allowing you to use them more effectively in small spaces. Overall, the DeWalt kit is good, but is not up to the quality of the Porter-Cable even though both have the same price."
3,"Decent, but watch out for dead pixels","Lured [...], I said to myself ""what the heck, I can always use another flat panel monitor."" While the Corian Pixo 17"" has lots of brightness and contrast and the image quality is generally good, my particular unit has seven dead pixels, more than the usual number I've seen. Six of them are dark red or blue so they don't bother me much, but the remaining one is bright -- make it sparkling! -- green near the center bottom which is quite annoying.Of course, right after I bought this I saw a top-of-the-class Sharp 17"" LCD monitor selling for just $50 more, so I was pretty angry at myself. My recommendation: if you budget is really tight, this is an affordable 17"" monitor [...]. Otherwise, stick with a namebrand like Sharp or Eizo."
4,Decent Monitor - Great Price,I just received my monitor today. Going to replace the CRT on my kid's machine that is about 8 years old (and was refurbished when I bought it).I tested the pixels and found two dead pixels which I doubt will be noticable for my unsophisticated purposes. No doubt this monitor was made in a facility along side much more expensive models. Great value. Hopefully it has some longevity.
2,No warrenty. No Support. Nice Monitor,"This is a manufacturer lcd from chi Mei's at ttp://www.cmv.com.tw/en/default.asp. It is sold under the name Corian Pixo but there are no attempts to brand it. The packaging is very generic with no indication that it's from any company in fact except the obscure website of chi mei's in the manual.Do not expect warrenty on this item as there is no contact information of any kind to take advantage of the 3 year warrenty. Just today I received a ""RETURN TO SEND, NOT DELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED""I'm disappointed by the fact Amazon is selling this item.Overall however, the monitor is acceptable but may be overpriced. There are many more similiar priced lcds on the market for the same price especially after the end of this year."
1,Stuck with failed monitor,"Yes, a good clear monitor for the money, if it works. My one failed after four months of use and since there is no warrantee on this item my money is lost. I now have an expensice door stop."
4,Lighter than I'd hoped,"I was looking for a deeper metallic brown shade of Bronze: this is closer to a bronze tinged silver. Product quality is good, though."
5,Rustoleum is top notch!,I always count on rustoleum whenever it comes to my spray painting needs. They're on top of their game! I used this paint on my skateboard trucks as well as some other household items made out of plastic and metal. It stick really well all the time without any primer or clear coat. Definitely go with Rustoleum!
3,The paint looks good.,"As the name suggests, this paint is silver. It is definitely not as shiny as in the pictures. There is way to much over spray. The can leaks when you use it, so you should wear latex gloves. The only good thing is that it sticks to everything and it is cheap."
1,Not at all what is advertised,"I bought this product based upon the reviews I read and the product description. Obviously, the previous reviewers didn't care about getting a true metal plated look, they just wanted a metallic appearance. I bought this product to paint some brass light fixture parts that I needed to have a polished chrome or nickel finish. The finish I got does not resemble the cap on the can at all. I prepared everything properly and was meticulous about following the instructions. The finish it gives is more like a brushed finish, rather than a brilliant reflective finish. However, FYI, if you desire the appearance of brushed nickel, the color isn't right. I will be returning this product for a refund ... which unfortunately, won't give me back the time and effort it will take to remove the paint from my fixture :-( This is fine if you want a dull metallic finish, but if you want a polished metallic finish, don't waste your time and money."
2,"Copper, gold, and chrome paints","I purchased all 3 colors for various projects. Here is my impressions.The good:The copper and gold paints are fantastic (5 stars). They spreads even, dry fast and the finish is brilliant. One can goes along way so the value is excellent.Now for the bad.The chrome paint is more of aluminum finish. Not a true chrome at all. Also the paint dries soft - meaning it never seems to cure hard. It stays somewhat sticky. This paint is a major disappointment. Only 1 star here.5 stars for copper and gold.1 star for chrome.*EDIT*After several months the initial brilliance of the copper paint seems to oxidize and turns dark. This may be due the real copper flecks in it. So to anyone buying this product, know it will change color from shiny to dull in a few months.Rating of paint reduced from 3 stars to 2 stars, unfortunately."
4,Rust Oleum Copper metallic spray paint,"I was hoping for, and got, a bright copper paint. My only concern is that, like real copper, this paint will tarnish. Who knew?? So if you're going to use it on something that gets touched or handled, expect tarnished fingerprints. I'd recommend the hammered copper rust oleum paint if the smudges are going to bother you."
3,JVC Radio,I purchased this JVC unit in November 2008. Istallation required a wiring harness that was not supplied for my vehicle so had to spend another $15.00 which was not really a big deal. As far as performance goes it sounds good. It does look like an aftermarket radio not like an oem replacement.Wish it was a little more flush with the dash. The volume know is in a goofy position...passenger side. I bought it because is one of the few units that play both cd's and cassettes which is nice for a books on tape listener.
3,Deva Curl Mist-Er Right,"I like the smell of this product, but I think my hair must be too thin for its use. It sort of gums up in my hair."
4,Not bad...,"So I don't love love the product but I certainly don't hate it. It does seem to help with de-frizzing and doing a bit of pick-me-up on curls, but for me not much more than what I kind do with water and/or reapply a bit more product. The smell is nice and refreshing."
2,Deva Curl..sticky curl,"Being a ""curly girl"" I decided to buy this lavender spray and see how it works. The smell was okay, but I didn't like the sticky part of it. After spraying this on my curls and ""scrunching"" upwards, I noticed that it got ""sticky"". After it dries, it leaves my curls somewhat hard and a bit less bouncy, my guess it's because of what's in it. I would say that if you want a lavender spray, buy some natural lavender oil and combine that with some water in a spray bottle, as for this, it's not for me."
1,This did nothing for me...,"I guess with this item I was expecting something to create some hold and make my curls look more ""fresh"" when they were becoming frizzy. To me this has done nothing more than water does, I feel as though with the exception of making my hands sticky when I try to scrunch this in after I spray I could have gotten the same effect and smell by putting some lavender oil drops in some water. Don't waste your money if you're expecting any styling results from this!"
1,Expensive and horrible,"I hate to diss DevaCurl as the Curly Girl method that the owner created has changed many people's curls for the better and helped people to accept and love having curly hair, but this product was awful. I heard it didn't used to have all this glycerin in it, and I think that's what my hair reacted to. I followed the directions and everywhere I sprayed it, I got horrible frizz. This spray created my worst 2nd day hair ever. Of this line, if I want something that refreshes my hair I will stick with Set It Free. I love One Condition and like ArcAngel."
2,wont buy it again,I have curly/wavy hair that is also fine. I purchased this product to use on non-shampoo days to give me a lift. It left my hair feeling sticky and didnt really do much deoderizing. It does have a strong lavender scent though. I would not use this product again. I think this product would be good for someone who has very thick curly hair.
4,Discovering Curly Hair,My hair changed from straight to curly a few years ago--in my mid 50's. My daughter introduced me to the Curly Girl hair stylists and that made a huge difference to my satisfaction with my newly discovered curly hair.I would rate all the Deva products I use 4 stars--they work well for me as I'm discovering the Curly Girl way of taking care of my hair. I didn't choose 5 because there are better products if you're concerned about additives in your hair products. I also use a mix of apple cider vinegar and water once a month to remove anything that has stayed in my hair. That and the Curly Girl products work well for me.
5,Smells fabulous! NOT just for curly heads!!,"We are hooked on this product! Freshens hair anytime -- great for morning bedhead! Keeps flyaways in line for styling, too. I use this on my daughter's hair all the time."
2,Suprised but I don't like this,I was for sure I would fall in love with this-No way. It stinks-even my daughter walked in while I was trying it and all she could say was gross what is that smell? Plus when you use it with the Deva products it makes hair sticky?? Not sure if I got a bad batch or what.
2,Disappointing,"I love the Deva Care range and use their shampoo, conditioner and AnGel styling product. I thought this mist would be good between shampoos or after exercise. However, rather than activating the gel already in my hair or reinvigorating curls as they claim, it just makes my hair frizzy and sticky with no noticeable difference to the curl. Ruins rather than refreshes the hair."
4,Now I know,"So much to read (700 pages) so little time, so I opted for the audio cassette version. Even so this biograghy was almost as much about Kennedy's dad, Joe, as JFK himself. However, their relationship really explains a lot about Kennedy's later life, the story we all know about. Hamilton did a wonderful job & the research was exhaustive. I hope Mr. Hamilton is able to complete the job."
4,Where can i find the TV movie,"Excellent book showing both JFK's weaknesses as any human has, and his strengths which few of us have. I enjoyed the book and i would love to know where to see the TV movie version. I wasn't alive when JFK was , my parents barely remember and as i am English we haven't done much in school ,but i found this book was a balanced account and interesting with out senstionalising because there is no need to sensationalise Jack Kennedy's life at all!"
4,Nigel Hamilton: Reckless Author,I enjoyed reading this book. I grew up in Massachusetts and was in first grade when Sr Theresa James came into our class weeping and sent us home early on Nov 22 1963. Mr Hamilton has written an exhaustive 800 page book on the first 29 years of JFK's life. Mr Hamilton likes his subject and tells the life of JFK as seen through the eyes of his friends. I thought I knew a lot about JFK but learned many new interesting facts about the young life of our 35th president. I would have given this book 5 stars but for Mr Hamilton's brutal treatment of Rose and Joe Kennedy. They are far more complicated personalities than Mr Hamilton lets on in his portrayal and his obvious hatred of these two undermines the credibility of his book. In spite of all the flaws I would still recommend this important book to the JFK enthusiast.
3,JFK: Reckless Youth,"This would have been an excellent book if Hamilton Nigel hadn't felt the need to play junior psychologists and interject his laughable and out dated concept. In fact, one has to question Mr. Nigle's ability to reason at all, when he not only constantly blames JFK's mother for his behavior and attitude, but ignores the reality of the affect of a cowardly, absent and philandering father. At what age does Mr. Nigel believe a person becomes responsible for their choices, if not at 20, 30, or 40, then when?"
2,A little thin substantively but nonetheless informative.,"Nigel Hamiton describes Jack Kennedy's early life from his pyshosematic use of illness to get attention from his absentee father to his ascension into political life as a Class of 1946 Congressional freshman. Hamilton offers insights on young Jack's defining his manhood independent of Joe Sr, his intellectual challenge of his Ambassador father's dangerous flirtation with Nazism, and the unrequited love suffered at the beginning of the Cold War.A little thin substantively but nonetheless informative."
1,Yet another JFK biography - why bother?,"It's such a shame that a biographer as good as Hamilton (see his fine biography of General Montgomery) has now chosen to write about American presidents Clinton and Kennedy. JFK was an immoral, womanising, corrupt little warmonger. He tried to overthrow the Cuban revolution by force, by supporting a few Cuban traitors, but he was so stupid, arrogant and ignorant that he did not even realise that the revolution was popular, so he did not give the traitors the USAF support they demanded. He started the US war against Vietnam by sending 18,000 US soldiers there, breaking the US government's word by violating its treaty commitments. And of course, like so many little undemocrats, he covered his bad deeds by being a Catholic and getting ritual absolution for his infidelities, his injustices and his warmongering. Why write about him?"
4,Good Intro Book,This book prepared me well for all of my other classes that build upon the basic physics concepts. Excellent practice problems.
1,MY order has not arriveed yet. It has long been over due.,MY order has not arriveed yet. It has long been over due. I thinkthe saller not mail me the book. It is already one month past since I ordered the book.
1,WHAT A CROCK,"This is a terrible dvd - a real nauseating experience. Barbara Mandrell only sang one song & Kenny Rogers sang two. Most of the 70 minutes was hogged by Tommy Ambrose a smarmy looking buffoon with a mediocre voice who simply relished hearing his own voice. He managed to destroy beautiful songs like Put Your Hand, Let It Be, You've got a friend & others.There's certainly no joy, no celebration in watching this dvd. Save your money & give this dvd a miss. It's not even deserving of one star but that is the lowest rating available.Yuck! Yuck! & double Yuck."
5,Changing directons was Marvin Gaye's strength in his music...,"A little over a year after the success of the classic ""What's Going On"" album and the successful follow up album, ""Trouble Man"", Marvin Gaye decided to take a different spin: instead of the message songs that are in ""What's Going On"" and to a lesser extent in ""Trouble Man"", Gaye decided to just make a sexually explicit (for 1973) album, and he acutally pulled it off in great style! The ablum shows off Gaye's doo-wop beginnings when he began as a doo-wop singer with the Moonglows, especially with the song, ""Come Get to This"".The Expanded Edition also shows the different cuts to the songs for the completed album, plus some bonus songs like ""The World is Rated X"" and ""Where Are We Going"". Worthwhile purchase."
5,Lover's Concerto,"After the success of What's Going On, Marvin Gaye moved away from social issues to issues of the flesh. Let's Get It On finds him singing about sex, not just about the physical pleasure one gets, but on a spiritual level. The title track is almost sermon like in its delivery where Mr. Gaye dispenses with all pleasantries and asks his lover to get it on. He not only feels good, but he feels sanctified. The song has a silky sound that matches Mr. Gaye's smooth vocals. The rest of the album finds Mr. Gaye searching for a love that will help him find that balance between the real and spiritual ecstasy he so desperately craves. The remastered package includes multiple takes and demos of the tracks, some of which are excellent and others are filler, but coupled with the original album it makes for a superior listening experience."
3,Good prodcuct but...,"I like this cutter and lockstud and if you are planning on doing small batches (50-150 shells) it is pretty good. The fact is however turning the lockstud is brutal on the hands after about 150 shells. It is really unpleasant, the knurled steel grip is like a flesh grinder and the amount of repetative force required is just bad for the hands. I had to give up using this forever because of how badly it would aggrivate my joints and I have no other issues or joint problems I just re-load allot for a .223. I gave this three stars though because it really works well if you are carfull how long you use it and how many shells you do. There are other brands but in all honesty for the money this is a great deal if you want to use a mechanical shell cutter. I have found a manual cutter such as offered by Hornady to be easier on the hands even though it is slower (not by much though because of shell change times)."
4,Lee Case Trimmer,The product is well built and finished. I've found that it is easy to use and appears to be of solid construction.
4,Make A Connection,"This collection of short stories is one of the most poignant pieces of modern literature I have ever read. It explores the idea of connecting with your fellow man in an age that is hell-bent on separation. It begins with the story ""Titanic Victim Speaks Through Water Bed;"" a story about a man who realizes the importance of having a physical being, only after he loses it, and ends with the tale of a ""Titanic Survivor Found In Bermuda Triangle."" This is the story of a woman who has devoted her life to one cause, and when that cause is gone, she sees that her ceaseless devotion has left her empty and unfulfilled. This collection speaks to all the hopes and fears that live deep within ourselves. After all, who wants to reflect on their life and see that it has all come to nothing? After reading this book, if you do not have a deeper appreciation for your friends and family, you have missed the point entirely. Make that connection and live your life with no regrets."
4,Original and daring,"Let's give Butler credit for going beyond conventional fiction and breaking into new territory. To be sure, some stories in here are just not very entertaining, but Butler writes very well and it is just his prose that is sometimes well worth reading."
1,Contrived,"Butler says he writes from where he dreams, but this book comes from the head. It's plotted and stale. Read ""A Good Scent"" and forget this one."
1,dead when you really need it,"My house has a crawl space about 2 feet high under the house. This area floods during heavy rains. Last sump pump rusted and I had to crawl through the cold, dark water to find it and reinstall with this Flotec. I tested it several times. What happens? It fails its first real test, only several months later, during a dire flood. The float lifted, but the pump didn't activate. What good is a $*&%* warranty when your house is flooding?"
5,Wonderful!,This book is an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn and connect with ascended masters and the angelic realm!
5,The Best Reference Guide,"For those who wish to learn about their guides and guardians, this is a great book. Doreen Virtue has a wonderful first-hand experience with each of these Archangels and Masters.I highly recommend this book to everyone who is seeking to know the heavenly realms better."
5,Inspiring,"This is one of those books to keep close by. It is a great reference tool as it is very informative. Aside from the factual side of it, there is a great energy with it. It is uplifting, and guiding. Great for the good times and helpful in the bad times."
3,Good Book!,"Great reference book, Doreen Virtue provides good information on each listed Archangel and Ascended Master and the list is quiet extensive!"
2,Not for me. . .,"The book covered any possible deity from any possible religion. I didn't think it was what I had hoped. There were about 7 entries on angels and even fewer on saints. Most of the entries were about ancient Egyptian gods, Celtic, Indian, and ""New Age"". Not the kind of book I was looking for."
3,Disappointed,"Many pages were earmarked, this was disappointing. Moreover there was a whole bunch of writing all over this book, also disappointing."
5,Another Wonderful Work by Doreen!,"This is wonderful! It is so amazing to learn about so many gods, and goddesses and the like. Doreen contacted each one and so each summary is a true account of what the spirit is truely about. Fantastic!"
4,Like ONE Piece of Fabulous Chocolate....,"I loved it, but want MORE! This book is a fantastic overview of the Archangels and Ascended Masters, but it left me wanting MORE about each one. That teeny bit said, the book is still fantastic for what it is...an overview of the AA and AMs. Maybe WE expect each book to be the end all and be all, but if that were so, why ever write another??? Buy this book, enjoy it and refer to it over and over and you will enjoy it as I have. Not my VERY favorite, but well worth having!"
5,Archangels & Masters,"I found this book to be exceedingly helpful, not only to learn about the different teachers and guides but also when trying to figure out which archangels/ascended masters would be helpful for my different problems. Doreen put a reference in the back of the book to guide you to the teacher best suited for each dilemma.Doreen also explains how even though she has specific invocations for each guide, your words and your prayers are what will work best for you.An extremely helpful book for me.Thank you."
4,A Who's Who in the Divinic World,"I found this book to be very interesting, not only from the descriptions of the 77 listed divinities, but particularly from the channeled information. This book is a starting reference, which makes it an easy read. It introduces you to them, and doesn't overwhelm you with their backgrounds. It's written in a way that she also wants us to communicate and create our own special friendships and relationships. Stretching across the gulf of time, it was reassuring to find a continuous love and commitment to humanity. Hope, help, and assistance. And, that all of us are never alone. We just have to learn how and want to commit to taking that first step."
5,Archangels & Ascended Master,I really enjoy this book and have flagged several pages that I use all the time whenever I am praying. This book is really a wonderful guide to work with and it's really nice to know that I was not too far off in my praying practices. I am so glad that Doreen took the time to write this wonderful book for us and reconfirming everything. Enjoy reading!
4,Good list of tips,The book is a guide on archangels and ascenced master it also give tips on how to call them in. It is exhautisve and easy to use. Very good for beginners. It does not however have pictures.
5,Wonderful.,"A keeper, something to read and re-read. Had the opportunity to confirm some previous knowledge and learned much more. Enjoyed it a lot."
5,This CD Is Well Worth The Extra Cost!,"This CD Brings A Whole New Side Of Britney I Think Most People Were Waiting For. This CD Is Generally More Mature And Has Alot Of Great New Sounds, From The R & B Influenced Track, ""Don't Go Knocking On My Door"", To The Smooth Seductive Tracks Like ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" And ""When Your Eyes Say It"". The Best Song On The Import CD Is ""Girl In The Mirror"". It's A 50000/10 Stars. It's Absolutely Beautiful."
4,Is this Import worth it.?,"I think this CD is a cool cd even though it's a bit different from her first one...the only good songs are, Oops...I Did It Again, Don't Go Knocking On My Door, What You See Is What You Get, and Lucky. The good songs from this import is Heart, You Got It All and Girl In The Mirrior even though it sounds like it should be on her first CD. Another song of Britney's that i think should be on her album is I'm So Curious which is on one of her singles. If anything i think you should by this CD!"
3,What a piece of...unimpressive work!,Take a look at the inside cover and look at the publishing companies. Its nice to see that Britney has no more of a creative bone in her body than to wear what the company tells her to and sing what they tell her to. She did not write one song! Like BSB and Nsync there is no creativity anymore.What makes things worse was the fact that she lipsyncs in concert. What is the entertainment world coming to? I would second guess this purchase. Definately not worth 2X the price for 3 extra songs. They're not that great. Even if someone else did write them.
4,OK but major quibbles,"The targus is OK but two problems present themselves immediately - One: putting credit cards or other plastic in the card holders may scratch that expensive screen.Two: The leather is handsome but the whole thing definitely becomes too bulky for your pocket. If you are a girl with a purse, that's not a problem. For the rest of us, it is!I do like that little matching card holder though - it beats a normal wallet if you don't carry too much. I gave the Targus to my fiancee and kept the small card holder. Maybe I'll get one of those metal holders for my palm instead."
1,Disappointed,When I received my order the velcro strip for the Visor was missing. I have tried to get it through Amazon and through Targus and I have still not gotten even a response. The case is of no use to me without it. I will have to find my own solution. I dont think I will buy another Targus product.
4,Wow!,"Although the 4th is less satisfying, I haven't listened to a symphonic work as hair-raisingly energetic as Karl Atterberg's Symphony No. 1 since the first times I heard Carl Nielsen's 5th and Douglas Lilburne's 2nd Symphonies! The tension is unflagging from the beginning, each movement flows logically into the next--down to a most satisfying final cadence--, and Atterberg works modal melodies and fanfare-like polyphonies into a work that's both modern and timeless. MORE ATTERBERG, YES, PLEASE!"
3,Sounded convenient but a little bulky,"This case was good for the first few days for it protects the palm v much better than the case that came with it. The idea of putting everything in one carry case sounded convenient, but it finally got a little bulky for me. It isn't really necessary (for me) to get all my credit cards and my checkbook out to check my to-do list. Overall, I'd give it a 3 for the protection it provides."
4,Well worth the read for advertising pros.,"A very intelligent book on advertising. The underlying concept -- DISRUPTION! -- isn't exactly new. But the book takes a fresh look at just how some businesses -- and advertisers -- have broken away from the pack of mediocre, wasteful advertising.And the result has often been dramatic increases in sales. The book is provocative, and most importantly, it makes you THINK. You can walk away from this bookwith plenty of ideas for how to improve your own advertising. For those who haveanything to do with advertising, it's well worth the read."
2,"Good theory, worth an article than a book",The author has come up with a great thought but this thought isn't profound enough to write a book. This is why the book is full of examples and lacks thought provoking insights.
2,"Good, but old news.","The idea of standing out from the clutter is re-presented in a jerky, repetitive format. Perhaps stemming from the author's non-native-to-English tongue. There are a few pearls here, though. Most of which, the concept of disruption levels. Otherwise, the books slips into brochureland once too often. I'm not sure if I'm reading a book on advertising or a collateral piece from Dru's agency."
5,Best Little Generator I Have Seen (In a class of its own),"As always, DeWalt exceeded my expectations. This gem arrived in perfect condition. Once I had completed assembly and added oil and fuel, I gave a very light tug on the rope to get a feel for how much resistance it would offer. It started! Have only had it a few weeks, but it works just as advertised. The automatic idle is a very nice feature which really keeps noise down when there is no load. Note - be sure to follow instructions, since the generator is shipped without oil. If you like to jump ahead, do not put in fuel or oil before assembling wheels and lifting hook."
5,Excellent generator Value!,Performs flawlessly. I do recommend that one uses a fuel stabilizer in the gas. I do and have never had any problems.
3,Late-medieval traveller's sketchbook.,"This book is a selection of illustrations from the 'Trachtenbuch.' This is a good source of ideas for late medieval/early renaissance costumers. The illustrations are ""sketchbook"" quality. The author seems to have travelled extensively and sketched the people of the cities that he visited. Costumers may find it difficult to translate the sketches into actual articles of clothing."
4,Bird's Eye View of Early 16th Century Clothing,"This is a basic book for those interested in history of costume in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. These are drawings of the clothing of the time made by an artist of the time. A range of people from a wide variety of walks of life and professions, as well as from many regions and countries, are presented. Gives an idea of what ordinary people wore, those who couldn't afford to have their portraits painted."
2,Black and White Plates,"I was very annoyed to find the sketches/plates in this book to be in Black and White, not color. I specifically bought this book to get a better idea of the colors available in the time period. I am sorely disappointed in the publishers for creating a book of art entirely without color."
5,An inspiring look at one of the wellsprings of Taoism.,"'The Way of Chuang Tzu' was written from previoustranslations of Chuang Tzu's writings, and as such mightseem to have little to recommend it. In fact, ThomasMerton's deep spirituality and obvious love of Asian culturebring these writings alive. Direct translations from theChinese are often spiritless and confusing, or at bestunintentionally humorous. Merton's inspirational writingsmake it clear why this work has lasted for 2000 years."
3,cleaning is a hassle,"The price : No complaint, especially the price I paid for last Christmas (2004), 30% less than normal selling price.The Grill : BBQ is easy and the cooking is faster, so much faster than a charcoal grill.The Rotisserie : crispy and tasty. My husband loves to make rotisserie or roast pork, and believe it or not, it is excellent.The cleaning : We both hate it. The cleaning is really a hassle, it is so difficult and it takes so much time, especially the rotisserie. We only used the rotisserie three times since we bought it because none of us wants to do the clean up."
3,Happy/Unhappy,"I give this 3 stars since I have to rate both items together.First - the grill is wonderful - perfect for 2 people and guest. We use it for our RV. The grill gets 5 Stars.The rotisserie is not as good. I give it 1 Star. First, it's hard to clean after greese and sauces spaters on it. Second, it doesn't hold a whole chicken of average size - maybe a cornish hen. I bought it for my RV so I could have rotisserie chicken like I do at home."
5,Well Worth the Money!,"For an up-and-coming band, this is a hell of a DVD package. Great picture quality, incredible sound quality (including a number of surround sound choices), and a tons of fun extras.Lots of eastern eggs hidden throughout, so there is much more to this DVD than simply a concert performance.It's well worth the money if you are into jam-prog rock."
4,Great Sound and Video Quality,"Any Umph fan would love to add this to their collection, Since this performance was from 2002 Mike Mirro was the drummer, not that he isn't exceptional, I just prefer the new drummer Chris Meyers. Totally worth the price, Andy's Last Beer, Utopian Fur, amazing.... The boys from the midwest really tear it up at home... And make sure to score your 2005 Skyline Tickets ASAP they go quick, the DVD is great but you cannot fully experience these guys till you see a live show!"
4,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With-- noise,"This album provides a good selection of music from the Lupin 3rd Anime.But poor quality sound reproduction gives it a ""mushy"" sound, unpleasant to an audiophile.Good material marred by sound quality is my conclusion."
2,No Facts,"I found this book to be interesting an easy read, but I learned very little. Like everyone else has stated its nothing more than her personal stories. If you want to learn about brokering notes then your out of luck. It's about being a note buyer and forking out money to attorneys, appraisers, title companies. There's not even much insight on this either."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This book has an appealing title, but that is where all ends. For any person willing to learn and venture into buying notes, this is a waste of money and time. Cute little stories and end results will teach you nothing about buying notes and profiting from this business. This book misleads you into thinking you will learn something from reading personals experiences. Slow pace, and wandering story telling... Move on to better authors...."
4,Fast cash,I liked the book. It helps me understand the ups and downs of investing in notes. I'll be careful when I do it!John Brinckerhoff
1,Poor tool,"The 3, gear ranges are hard to lock into, the batterys only last a few months and cost over $78.00 each to replace. Tool is very heavy. Has no belt clip. Hammer drill is slow drilling."
5,"Great drill, great price.","I absolutely love this drill. I'd always wanted a DeWalt and my father bought me this drill for my birthday. I could never say enough about how wonderful this drill is. I've read the other reviews--the ones that state the gears are plastic and the chuck wobbles. I've also read the reviews that say get a Milwaukee instead. Milwaukee's are good drills too. However, the company I work for bought us two Milwaukees and they lasted two years before they both had problems. The main problem? Wobbly chucks. It can happen to any drill. If you're careful and don't beat up your equipment, it's designed to last. My DeWalt is rock solid and I've used to to redo the interior of my parent's house. This drill is top quality and you owe it to yourself to give it a serious look."
4,couple of notes,"I just wanted to correct the reviewer below - this drill too is made in Mexico. A lot of people have noted that the gear selector switch can be hard to move sometimes. I have found that just spin the drill again and it usually moves easier. A buddy has the Milwaukee 14.4 and it is significantly lighter.... his drill is a few years old so I'm not sure it's the same as Milwaukee's current 14.4, but if you're shopping weight should be a consideration."
2,Clutch is USELESS,"I will give Dewalt credit for the sheer power of this new drill but because of that, I am in the process of purchasing another drill to do much of my work. Even when the clutch is set at the lowest setting, it is too powerfull and either drives the screw through the work or strips the hole. I would only recomend this drill for people doing heavy work through tough media."
2,Defective Clutch ***,"After one return for a new drill and then trying several Drills at the Depot, and two calls to Dewalt, I finally got the answer to why the clutch DOES NOT WORK in low gear - the drill is DEFECTIVE. The Dewalt tech put it this way: ""We designed it to work in all speeds, but that's just the way it came out."" In other words, the production model is defective. I have an old 2-speed 18V drill, and the clutch works as it should in the 0-450 rpm range. The XRP clutch does not work in the 0-450 range. Since low speed has the highest torque, this is where you most need a clutch!! Wait for Dewalt to fix this! They know it is defective, but are trying to tell everyone it is normal. Bad show."
2,Chuck or Motor Arbor Wobble ?,"This new XRP model seems to have a few bugs in it.#1-Many people have complained about the clutch not working at low speed.#2-The transmission has also become suspect.I know the clutch definitly has problems, but the real problem is the fact that either the chuck (new Jacobs single sleeve) or the motor arbor it is threaded onto wobbles like crazy.I am returning mine before the 30 day guarantee and will wait untill someone at Dewalt will actually go out and look at what they are shipping. I would take it apart myself to see if its the chuck or drill but I want to make sure I get my money back."
3,Clutch Won't Work in Low Gear,"I'm returning this drill. The clutch won't slip at all, no matter what the setting, when using the lowest of the three gears. I contacted DeWalt, and they said they received a lot of questions about this. DeWalt says this is normal for this drill and suggests using the middle gear (which is equivalent to the highest speed setting on two-speed drills) for driving screws. The manual doesn't say that the clutch won't work in low gear, so I'm not sure why DeWalt tech support feels this is normal. Other than this, the drill is well-balanced and I like the ratcheting chuck for one-handed tightening of bits."
4,"Homeowner or Pro, this is the one to buy","The 14.4 volt Heavy duty Dewalt drill is a great tool. Check the specs and compare to other brands - Dewalt comes out on top. It's worth the few extra dollars. The only complaints i've heard are that the 1/2"" chuck doesn't hold the small drill bits but this one minor ""glitch"" can be overcome by using hex-shank bits. This drill has the power to burn in 3"" screws into 2X lumber without hesitation. In my opinion it is an ideal drill for the homeowner, craftsman, and the professional. It's lightweight, well balanced, (just slightly top heavy but not at all cumbersome) and, you have to admit, it's sleek in design. I give it four grunts."
1,DeWalt Doesn't Give Any Service,"Great looking Drill/Driver!! I bought this unit to install some hardibacker boards for a tile job, and I thought I needed the high ft/lbs of torque. After putting down about twelve sheets of hardibacker and screwing them to the floor, the adjustable clutch went out. FAILED to work. Sent it right back to DeWalt where they looked at it and sent it back unrepaired. I sent it back 2 more times and each time they returned the unit without repairing it. Numerous phone calls to DeWalt to no avail. Finally it got beyond the warranty and they said they would charge me to look at it one more time. I bought a Porter Cable Drill Driver and finished the floor without incident.It's too bad that DeWalt spends all their money marketing their products and very little on giving good customer service. They could have made this a positive experience,instead they screwed a good customer. I WILL NEVER BUY DEWALT PRODUCTS AGAIN!!"
4,"TORQUE,TORQUE,AND MORE TORQUE!!!!!!!!","After burning out two Sears drills trying to drive screws into cement Hardibacker board, I bought this DeWalt unit. Believe me, this puppy has the torque to do the job!! At first it was disconcerting because it had so much torque that it almost tore out of my hand. Once I realized that in order to do the job that I was asking this drill to do, I had to supply the muscle to control it. 400 ft/lbs of torque is not for the wimpy. I would have given this drill a 5 star rating except for its inability to lighten up on the torque enough to drive screws into some pine boards in another project. They just stripped out even at the lowest settings. I really don't care because I have other wimpy drill to do the light work. If your have a very tough job with hard drillin' this is the drill for you."
1,Piece of Junk,"The three speed selector switch gets jammed. The batteries run down very quickly. The clutch only works on the first five settings, after that it's useless. There is almost no trigger control. You can't make it go slow enough. Overall, this drill is worthless and was returned immediately."
5,Heavy duty drill,"I have been very pleased with this heavy duty tool. I've used it for inserting long lag screws, as well as inserting small screws and drilling. It's heavy, but rugged."
2,Nice Case - Horrible Clip,"I bought this for a PDA case. The day I got it, I wore it on my 2 1/4th inch duty belt, where my radio usually goes. The belt's thickness is the same as a regular belt (The belt was Accumold).Within 5 minutes, I sat down in the car, and the clip completely popped off, rivet and all. The clip rivet is held in by the leather only, no stabalizer.This, combined with the fact the clip would pop the case off my regular dress belt, made it worthless."
3,"Thanks, reviews were helpful.","I was thinking about switching to the Targus until I read all your reviews. I have the Franklin Covey e-Pocket Leather belt clip case and after 2 years of hard use, the spring is not very tight and I was looking for a replacement. From the reviews, my belt clip seems to hold up better than the Targus, so I'll get another Franklin Covey. Also, it comes in black and has an additional belt loop behind the metal clip for those who want it."
2,Clip broke off,"I really thought the case was great until the clip part broke off. What good is a carrying case designed for your belt if breaks off?! The metal part that holds the rotating rivet (a great feature!) appeared to spread apart, allowing the clip to pull out. I wish it were made more sturdily...then I think that it would be great. I took less than a month for the item to break. I wouldn't get it if I were you."
2,"Nice style, but WARNING falls easily off belt-BIG problem","This case is beautifully made. It's swivel handle seems like a neat idea.BUT all of that is far overshadowed for me because I can not rely on it staying on my belt when I wear it. Worse, especially when wearing a sport coat, etc., it sometimes falls off my belt *unnoticeably*, so that my Palm 3xe (and my data!) can very easily be lost. This has happened three times -- all within my house, thankfully. I cannot afford the risk of losing data by wearing the case outside my home. (I will not keep replacing the Palm, especially when Palm keeps making its upgrades incompatible with prior versions. Of course, this last is a Palm problem, not a Targus one.)I will buy a new case.A PDA case needs to have a secure belt *loop*, not merely a clip -- especially a clip like this one which does not have a security 'lip' at the bottom of the clip to make detachment from the belt far less likely."
2,Yeah okay,I enjoyed a few of these. Giuliani's prose poems and her exploration of racism and the black experience give this collection substance. Other poems in this collection are underwhelming.
3,Not what I expected,"When I saw this book, entitled ""Love Poems"", I bought it for a little Valentine's Day inspiration. It started off on a good note, and there were also poems towards the end that were pretty interesting, too. But when I got to the middle of the book, I was lost. These poems were more like essays, and the author began to talk about the KKK, and how they burn churches and crosses. The KKK is the last thing on my mind when I pick up a book about love poetry, as I certainly do not get the ""warm fuzzies"" reading about them and their hateful acts.(But was that the point of the poem and I missed it? I don't know) . If the author chooses to write essays about the KKK, that's fine...but I would not include it in a book that has love poems in it...and if they are included, then maybe the author should give the book a title that is not so misleading...like ""Love Poems about people who are D##kheads""."
5,A powerful book that teaches love in every way.,This book is completely incredible! A beautiful work of art that explores the power and magnificence of every type of love.
2,Silly & Somewhat Trivial Doses of Giovanni,"I can't tell you how many times my eyes rolled while reading through this. It reminded me of the worst aspects of contemporary verse--self-indulgent, cliche, and ultimately unsatisfying--a bit like eating a cheese burger at McDonald's, when there's so many better things to eat elsewhere. The older pieces are the best, but the bulk of the rest is just silly."
5,Works great with the PSP,My daughter lost her PSP charger so I went online and found a cheap replacement. I purchased it a while ago and it's still works fine.
3,Charger is different from the picture.,"Got the item very quick. However, the charger is not the same as pictured. It's made in China with cheap plastic. Disappointed with the seller for misleading the item. However, it seems work ok. For the price I paid, it's kind of too expensive."
4,Does the job,"I bought this to charge a Sony Reader device as opposed to a PSP. It does the job and charges just fine. It doesn't feel incredibly durable so I don't want to drop it on the floor too many times, but it is a great value for the price!"
4,"generic, but works fine so far","Your typical, generic adapter. I have successfully used it to charge a PSP and a Sony Reader Ebook. I will repost if any problems with it in the future."
4,Good Deal,"This charger does exactly what it's supposed to do. It works fine with no issues, and the price is truly unbeatable. The only thing that I don't like about this product is the cord length. It is only about four feet long. If you want to use this to charge your PSP while playing, make sure you are very close to an outlet. Other than that, great product for a great price."
2,Good for a cheap fix but it wont last.,"I ordered this product to replace a PSP charger that I had lost. The product isn't actually designed specifically for the psp, it is a generic cellphone charger that works with the psp. The charger quickly overheats and feels very flimsy. While pulling the charger out of the socket about a week after purchasing the case simply fell apart. Overall I would only recomend this as an emergency charger until you can find or afford a real one."
4,Purchased as a gift for an 11 year old - He says product is fine.,Purchased as a gift for an 11 year old - He says product is fine. I told him it is a charger from a cell phone and might not work as well as the original. He say it works for him with no problems.
1,Screwed by Post Office,"The product was delivered, unfortunately, the Post Office is responsible for the missing CD's. Upon delivery, the Post Office failed to secure the mail box, and the empty packaging was found outside the mail box, which was locked in the ""open"" position. The PO states that it's the seller at fault because it was'nt insured. The PO has failed to act on my claim. Though the theft is not the sellers fault, I found it impossible to reach the seller."
1,Piece of crap,"This is horrible. It is cheap plastic and mine does not work. If you are lucky enough that it does light up it is so dim you can only see it from a foot away. If you return it you loose your shipping cahrges 11.99 and are charged a restocking fee.Save your money. The old saying fits here ""you get what you pay for"""
2,Packaging misleading,"The pictures on the packaging make it look like the sign will be standing about mailbox height. Instead, the unit is only 5"" off of the ground - and it would have been lower if I had pushed the stakes into the ground all of the way.Since it sits so low on the ground, it will be useless in winter, when it will be buried under snow.I am going to try to improvise a way to have it mounted at mailbox height, as I had thought that it would be out of the box. Otherwise, I will be returning it since mounting it on my house (the other alternative supported out of the box) won't allow it to get enough sun to keep the unit charged.The actual unit seem to work OK with the full charge that the unit shipped with. I will have to see over the next few days if it is able to maintain a charge with the solar cells."
2,the solar light that flickers,"This purchase arrived very promptly and in good condition.No negative concerns for the concept of it operating properly,although have never realized how often this device flickers the house number.Truely had much higher expectations for this house number to operate on or off, but flicking on and off can only achieve bystanders attention.Not really confident it was to flicker.For this reason, stars review."
3,"Cute, but...","This book was highly recommended to me. Maybe that was a problem because while I found the book very 'cute', and it did have great cake recipes, I found it... funny but (do I hate to be critical or what!), simple. A cute tale of the sandwich generation of taking care of teenagers and one's parents. Its an easy read and I found amusing parts, but mostly, just 'ok'. (sorry)."
3,I want cake!,"Simple read, no complex character development here. You learn a lot about the different kinds of cake out there, plus I like her analysis about how people treat dessert (""oh, just a small piece for me."") My question for the author is why she even included the son, Lucas, in college. It is like he isn't a part of the family at all. I wonder how he would have felt if this whole family was reinventing themselves without him."
5,Deliciously Enjoyable,I can't quite find the right words to describe this book. It was a superb pleasure to read. Jeanne Ray's writing is beautiful and encourages the reader to keep reading. Eat Cake is one of those books you can't put down - hours pass quickly and pages even moreso - while reading the story of Ruth and her family. The characters Jeanne Ray created in this novel are people that are intriguing and it is easy to relate to them and their life stories.I would highly recommend reading this book. You'll likely turn into a Jeanne Ray fan. This was the first of her books that I read (based on a suggestion from Amazon because I liked Claire Cook's novels). I now started Step Ball Change and cannot put this novel down either.
5,A Slice of Real Life,"I loved this book! I got it because I really enjoyed Ray's Julie & Romeo books, but I think I liked this one even better. The multi-generational aspects, and our protagonist having to juggle the conflicting needs of her battling parents, her hubby finding himself, and her daughter considering growing up were highly entertaining. I identified with all 3 generations, and found myself laughing out loud more than once."
3,Comfort Food,"""Eat Cake"" is as its name suggests. It's the literary equivalent of comfort food: warm, sweet and designed to make the reader feel good. It's nice to indulge in such books occasionally, though, even if they should never become the staple of an intellectual diet."
3,Quite Tasty,"Jeanne Ray has baked up a deliciously good, cute fairy tale story with her third novel, Eat Cake.Life has thrown Ruth Hopson, the main character, a curve ball. She is living with her moody teen daughter, her husband who has just lost his job and her tenacious mother. And if that wasn't enough, Ruth's disabled, nomadic father comes to live with her. How does Ruth deal with all this? She imagines herself inside a big warm cake! Baking is Ruth's happy place and she has a feeling its healing qualities just might turn the family around, both emotionally and financially.Pull up the covers and sit down with a big slice of cake for this enjoyable, warm-hearted, stress-relieving story."
5,Chaos reawakens love,"It was interesting to be nearly finished with this book when I watched the movie ""Big Fish"" last night. They both contain a lot of the same feelings about the fathers in the story and the wonder of families and work they require if life within them is to be fully lived. Jeanne Ray is wonderful at making her characters both lovable and fascinating. I loved the occasional wise counsel of the physical therapist (nurse?) as she expanded character's horizons of what they could accomplish.My daughter made the carrot cake from the recipes in the back of the book, and it was delicious."
4,satifying story,"I am a big fan of Jeanne Ray. My favorite is Step-Ball-Change but this is second. Don't read it if you're hungry or dieting. :-) Actually it is, as usual, a good story of marriage and family dynamics. I really enjoyed the grandparents and the teenager. Read ALL of Jeanne Ray's books. You won't be disappointed."
3,6cd unabrid EXTREMELY SLOW START THEN PICKS UP,"There is nothing wrong with sharing a cake with family and friends. But the author wanted to go into SO MUCH detail on the mixing, measuring, making, folding, smelling, seeing, tasting that it slowed the story. I nearly gave up.Then the family dynamics came into play and that was interesting. But every now and then we had to put up some more baking and really strange combinations of cakes. I found myself saying get on with the story. I just wanted to know the next problem and how she fixed it.If you could shorten the story by 10%, really cut back on the descriptions of baking I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Chick Lit for Thinkers,"Before Chick Lit there were women's contemporary writers like Elizabeth Berg and Barbara Kingsolver -- writers who touched at the issues and concerns of women, but did so with intelligence and wit. Jeanne Ray writes in the same way -- perhaps with a bit less intensity, but definitely with the same pen. Eat Cake tells the story of a middle-aged woman who must recreate herself when her life is turned upside-down by her husband's layoff and warring parents. She delves into her deepest desires and finds -- herself."
3,Made Me Want To Bake a Cake,"I have mixed feelings about this book. The descriptions of the cakes and the connection of the main character had me dreaming of cake. However, the plotline was predictable at best. So if you're looking to lose yourself in an amazing chocolate bunt cake with whipped lemon icing, read on."
2,not a good book,i got 1/3 way through and gave up. just not interesting enough for me. too light. i guess good for a very light summer read.
2,A Big Disappointment,"Save your money, and buy her first two books in paperback. If you're already read them, read them again. And skip this lightweight, ineffective, self-indulgent book. Alas, if you have already purchased it, skip to the back section -- to the cake recipes. With this book, it is better to bake its contents than read them."
3,Miami Dolphins,"I was waiting for this DVD 5 years, the complete history but unfortunatelly was not complete. I wish to have another extra content like Marinos biography, the rivalities against buffallo, NY Jets, a real game like the classic when the dolphins beat the 85 Bears in monday night football, and the statistics one of the most winning franchaise and the bios of the great dolphins Larry Cszonka, Bob Griese, Paul Walfield, Dan Marino, the Marks broothers, and Don Shula, like other DVDs. I recomend to anyone that is not familiar with the dolphins, but for a great fan, will be a little helpfull. Also the 72 Americas Game was solt separatelly, so why include it here?"
5,nice dvd,I thought this was going to be a box set but it was only a 2 disk set. It was not a complete history lesson but thats not the sellers fault.... godd dvd tho!!!!!!
3,"Rather ""fishy""",I gave this as a gift and it was good to see for a first time. It should be good to pass on to someone else and so on and so on.
2,Remix...,I bought this CD because I loved the music that dancers were using. This is all remixes of Solace's previous work. Several of the songs are good. The rest are just way too trendy. It was my first Solace CD but I turned around and bought the originals. I am so glad I did. Love the other stuff.
5,addictive,This writer is addictive. My husband told me to order all of Jack Reacher novels. We both love this guy. Everyone we know would love a guy like this in our lives. Great read!!!!!! Great writing and from start to finish non-stop action. Loved it!!ThanksJAS
2,Reacher Reaching for What?,"In The Hard Way, Jack Reacher has lost the edge that defined his role in the previous novels in this series. Now, he thinks and sits a lot, rarely acts and seems to be reaching his end as an action hero.I have read all the books in the series and have watched Jack Reacher evolve from a hard-edged, no-nonsense seemingly amoral avenging and revenging angel into a character who is now developing into a ""thinking"" machine with feelings.He is described in The Hard Way as being without the conscience gene; yet he is doing what he does for Kate and Jade...a show of conscience and a contradiction.The trademark action is gone, except for a predictable ending that occurs in relatively few pages.Jack Reacher may have overreached his need to be. Now, his publisher is reaching for a new, less action-oriented incarnation of a once powerful hero. Has the twenty-first century hit Reacher? Is he now becoming a ""sensitive"" action hero? I hope not."
4,I love Jack Reacher!,"As usual, Lee Child's Jack Reacher hits the pages with grace under fire! Reacher is one of the few mystery characters that becomes more complex and three-dimensional with each book in the series. Although he exhibits the same characteristics as the first novel in the series, you learn little things about him in each book that help make him real.My only disappointment with this book is that I figured out the mystery/plot line almost from the beginning and could almost predict how things were going to go! There was a clue (which I won't reveal here) when Reacher first looked around Edward Lane's residence, that for some reason clicked in my brain and had me saying ""I know what is going to happen and why..."" And although part of me was a bit disappointed that I knew the outcome, the twists to get there were fulfilling.Like I said in my title: I love Jack Reacher!"
2,Expected Fireworks,"Seeing Lee Child's name in every single bookstore gave me the impression this guy is incredible.A friend let me borrow this book. My first Lee Child. Perhaps my view is somewhat distorted due to the fact that I started at No. 10 and not No. 1, nor have I read additional Lee Child books.The beginning had me into the story straight away I'll give Mr Child that. But I kept expecting fireworks, amazing ""wow how's he gonna get outta this one?!"" plots and, in hearing some of my girlfriends talk about how spunky Jack Reacher is, a MORE likeable guy than what was actually on the page. But no. I found the plot average, not that engrossing, and it was only the last 50 pages where I held on to my seat cause the ride was awesome. To have to wait until the end to get the awesome parts was a waste of my time. I'll forget this one immediately and won't bother reading another Child.Average.Average.Average.Kids books are more engrossing."
5,The Hard Way: A Jack Reacher Novel,"Loved it! It was a typical Jack Reacher novel. He did it the hard way but gets the bad guy anyway. It is good seeing justice being done, even if it may be a little drastic. The Jack Reacher novels are one of the few series that my husband and I both love to read."
3,The Hard Way.......more like hard going.,"Firstly let me say that I am a massive Lee Child fan and I have read every book and I eagerly anticipate seeing who will play Jack Reacher when the books get made into films !!!However I think this latest offering was written to a deadline or perhaps Lee Child just got bored along the way!!I have waited for the new title since I read about it on the Lee Child web site and ordered it from the US just because I could not wait the extra 3mths before Uk release, To my horror I found what was to be a brilliant plot line very thin indeed and the ending a major let down, where has the Reacher of Killing Floor, Persuader and The Enemy gone too ???I would hate Jack Reacher to turn into a ""Pulp"" charactor and should retain some depth and mystery !! If Lee Child has to rest him a bit then fine I can wait, just do not deliver him in mediocre plots !!"
3,Probably the weakest Jack Reacher book.,"I love Jack Reacher and have gotten many of my friends hooked on him. Though I enjoyed this book, it is the weakest of the series. There is almost no action until the end of the book and then it is not much by ""Reacher"" standards.If you are considering this book as your first Jack Reacher/Lee Child book, stop now. Order any of the earlier books and come back to this one. Otherwise you may find this book boring and will miss out on a great series of books. But do come back to it.I am certainly not ready to give up on Jack Reacher/Lee Child as I have done with other writers who have lost their way like Patrica Cornwell with Kay Scarpetta."
2,"Boo, Hiss",Not the Jack Reacher's I have read. Lee is not up to speed on this one. Looking forward to the next.
3,Reacher,Reachers transition to civilian life is better than I anticipated. The novel has many unusual twists.Very good and fast read
1,The Hard Way,"I have always enjoyed reading all of the Lee Child, Reacher Series books, but I am upset that even Lee Child has had to weigh in politically in The Hard Way. You may wonder what I am talking about. It seems to me that this is a thinly veiled comment on the wars our country are fighting in the middle east. Actually, it is a thinly veiled comment on any war we have fought since WW2. I read books to escape the everyday media humdrum that is constantly trying to pound us into their political beliefs. Now, even John Reacher is a liberal. To me this did not need to be a part of this series. One less series and writer to read. Too bad."
2,Boring,"The first couple of Jack Reacher novels I read I enjoyed. But the more of them I read, the more bored I get. The characters are just clones from previous novels. Same old dialogue (some very dull). This author is also a very passive writer. He over uses the verb ""was."" He uses it 10 times on every page--page after page. It's the lazy way to write. A better writer would take the time to think of more interesting verbs. Lee Child must've never taken a good writing class. And his main character, Jack Reacher, is getting very dull."
4,Lee and Reacher Ride Again!,"I am a big fan of the Reacher series. Reacher reached me immediately the first book I read. Sort of the Clint Eastwood of the military police (now ex-military), he has no reservations about deciding what is just and what is not. This tale involves him being accidentally dragged into a kidnapping case. Reacher really had to work hard on this one. The plot is a good one and he is supported by good people. In the supporting cast are some mercenaries who received some very damaging treatment in the dirty bowels of Africa. I'm not sure if these soldiers' stories are based in reality, but it was pretty shocking and disturbing. The main plot was not so distrubing, but the side story of the soldiers in Africa as POW's was quite disturbing. This was a pretty intense cat-and-mouse game, but very entertaining."
1,A long long hard way to go,"If you have never read anything about Jack Reacher, you might like this book. I had read them all prior to ""The Hard Way"" and would have read it just to keep pace. This book ranks right up there with The Gold Coast by Nelson Demille. Boring! You keep reading and reading waiting for the action to begin and it never happens. The last 50 pages are indicative of the way Lee Child usually writes but getting there is agonizing slow. Skip this one and read all the rest. You will have missed nothing."
2,not the best intro to jack reacher,"a much respected friend praised the jack reacher books up and down so i found a copy of THE HARD WAY at a used book store and decided to give it a try. it took 200 pages into the book before the plot picked up. jack reacher's character is well developed, but the story line started out so darn slowly. i will give lee child another chance in hopes that my first book choice was a weaker choice. two more used lee child books await..."
2,"Dull, plodding story doesn't keep up with Reacher","I'm enduring the book only so I can find out what happens in the end. This is far below what I expect from the usual Jack Reacher story. It seems that author Lee Child put his computer on auto-pilot and hit ""write"". Plodding action, indecisive dialog, stale characters. I suspect someone else is writing whole passages depicting Reacher in the settings -- Manhattan, East Anglian countryside -- only to demonstrate knowledge of the local area. And, the reveal of good vs. bad guys happened way too soon. Despite this, I won't give up on Lee Child and Jack Reacher, but compared to my most recent read, ""61 Hours"", this is a weak effort by Lee Child and his team of researchers. Give it a pass."
2,Certainly NOT the Best in the Series,"I'm a huge fan of the series overall but there have been one or two ""less than thrilling"" thrill rides, including The Hard Way. The first two hundred pages or so are not at all exciting.....rather, they're nearly DULL. The story starts to shift a little and pick up right around the middle of the book and then BAM - the action, excitement and story itself all get rolling and do not stop. You definitely do not want to start with this book if you are new to the Jack Reacher series. If you're reading them in order, as I am, no need to skip this one. Just know it might take a little while to get into the story."
2,Too easy!,I love Jack Recher and all of his books up until this one. This one was OK but I figured it out very early on in the book so it was tough to read.
3,not a feel-good read,"My first Lee Child book and I must admit it grabbed me and pulled me all the way to the end in one sitting. Some good surprises, and some predictability. I suppose I can't fault a thriller with mercenaries for being violent, but it was too violent for me. All the horrible things that bad men can do to men, women, and children -- they're described graphically, if briefly, at some point during the story. I was excited to start out reading, but by the end I just felt ill. If you want to escape harsh reality, this is indeed the hard way."
4,"hard way, easy read","I picked up my first Lee Child (audio) book at the library, and really enjoyed the character Jack Reacher and the adventure he ensues after he casually re-visits a New York City coffeeshop one evening. Although the script plots out like a ""super-tough guy"" comic book, somehow the author makes it all work for me.Dick Hill does a great job with the audio book. Looking forward to finding my next Jack Reacher adventure! 4 stars!"
4,Wanted to give 4.5 stars,"I read this because it was recommended to me by Amazon after I bought a book by Michael Connelly. This was better. The two have very similar styles. Both have very plot driven, very economical writing styles. Child's is even smoother and you find yourself frequently marvelling at little gems of description of people or things that are concise and yet perfectly capture the person or object in question. Also, Child seems to have just a little more aphoristic sort of content than Connelly. Anyway, this was a very quick read. I think I guessed part of the main twist of the story but not all. The story struck the right balance between the extremes of thrillers, too simple and impossibly byzantine."
3,The Hard way,"THIS IS MY FIRST READ OF A LEE CHILD NOVELSO I AM NOT AQUAINTED WITH PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS.I FOUND THIS PARTICULAR STORY PREDICTABLE, NOT A PAGE TURNER, I HATE TO USE THE WORD BORING, BUT TO ME IT WAS.THE ONLY REASON I FINISHED IS, I ALWAYS FINISH A NOVEL, WELL USUSALLY,I DID SO BECAUSE I HAD OTHER BOOKS TO GET TO.jACK REACHER'S CHARICATURE WAS DID NOT INSPIRE ME TO ROOT FOR THE GOOD GUY,pAULING SEEMED TO HAVE ALL THA CONTACTS,CONSIDERING THE PAST OF REACHER WHICH TIRNED THE STORY UPSIDE DOWN.IF THIS THE BEST OF LEE CHILDS, THEN I'LL STAY WITH MY OWN AUTHORS."
1,The Hard Way by Lee Child,"I purchased this book for my 93 years old mother. When she received the book it was not a large print book which is what I had ordered. She lives in Illinois and I live in California so I was unable to package up the book and take it to the post office. She is unable to do that. Therefore, this was a most unsatisfactory order."
5,They are all great reads,I have read 9 of his books so far so I have 9 more to go. Where does he come up with so many different and compelling scenarios?
5,Great Mysteries,"This was another great novel in the Jack Reacher series. I haven't missed any books in this series. Mr. Childs, please keep them coming."
3,Time to stop for Reacher... and Lee Child,"""The Hard way"" , like other Child's books, is still a pageturner and fast reading. But for the first time in these series I couldn't wait for the book to end. As other reviewers mentioned, it is really annoying to read ""Reacher said nothing"" three to five times on each page. Also, Child began to repeat himself; all those kidnapping plots lost their originality and the end was so predictable after first hundred pages that I continued reading just to get a closure.As for the closure, I'd really like to get the last book in the series - where Reacher loses (he does not have to die, but at least to lose his composure... get married, at least!:-). His character stopped any development, and even though this stability has some charm in the first books, by now it became annoying cliche."
2,A disappointment,"Some of the Reacher novels--such as The Killing Floor--have been incredibly good, but I was genuinely disappointed in this one. The author describes Reacher as heroic, a loner, etc., but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told. Phrases, such as ""back in the day,"" get repeated much too often. Reacher has become a caricature of himself."
3,Not as good,I've read all the other Jack Reacher books and this was the slowest moving. Still a good read but just not up to the others.
4,Reacher is just one of those characters...,"I am pretty sure I would not pick him up if I saw him hitch hiking but he is a great addition to the world (yes, I know he is not real). A lot of action and surprises ...really do wish he changed his clothes more often...it is almost distracting . Love his logic and analytical skills."
3,SPREAD OUT THE ACTION A LITTLE,"This was my first Lee Child read and after scanning a lot of reviews I expected more. During 90% of the book I thought Reacher was a pretty boring guy. He talks big and does nothing Columbo couldn't have done, he investigates. When the action scenes finally appear it is almost a surprise because I had seen no indication Reacher had it in him. Maybe I shouldn't have started this far into the series."
4,The Hard Way,Lee Child when are they going to start making Jack Reacher movies! We can't wait to long...
3,A predictable read,"This is my first Lee Child book and I am sorry to say I was disappointed. The story started out great, definitely keeping my attention for about half of the book. Past that point the antagonist mostly fell out of the picture until the very end. He is presented as entirely evil, by the way, although he managed to get two beautiful women to fall in love and marry him.The Reacher character has some positives but I found him hard to like without a better understanding of his past. His romantic involvement with another character seemed artificial to me. The resolution was satisfying but with little left to the imagination. The bad guys have no chance and every one of them is disposed of handily. The story has an interesting premise and the dialog is used effectively but to me it came to a Bond imitation and with less danger involved."
3,Written for a tax break,"A lot of this one seems to have been written to justify a tax deduction for a trip to England. There are many descriptions of well-known London sights. Reacher speculates that the London Eye might be for the tourists. What a smart guy! I am planning to read all the Reacher series, in order, but I am losing my enthusiasm. The action scenes seem too easy to me. Reacher turns, grabs something and POW, BIFF, BAM! He breaks some bones. Or he throws the guy he's stalking off by running quickly around the building! I don't know, it just doesn't seem spectacular to me. Maybe Reacher is just a modern-day Billy Jack."
3,Typical Jack Reacher Formula,"I like the Reacher books, even though they are preposterous. Reacher, of course, is a caricature of the loner super-hero and this book is no exception. Sometimes I think the name ""Reacher"" is literal -- in other words, the author may be reaching a bit too far in his plot turns. BUT...on the whole, this was a good Reacher novel, if you can just suspend belief and reality for a few hundred pages. It's a good yarn, with a lot of suspense and some pretty well-drawn characters. I think the writing here is a shade better than in Child's other Reacher books and the plot is creative. If you're a Reacher fan, you'll like this one. I am and I did."
1,The Hard Way,"I just finished The Hard Way, and it was.....hard to finish!The first couple of Child's books I read I thought were great but the last two have been horrible. Jack Reacher has become an all-knowing....robotic...boring... character that should be put to rest. The book moves very slowly, the dialogue is nonexistent, and how does a guy who never changes his underwear always get the girl. The only good thing I can say about the book is that it made me laugh occasionally. Unfortunately, the authors intent was not humor. The next time I want to read about a super hero I will buy a comic book and save alot of money."
5,The Hard Way,The Hard Way: The story line was very credible and easy to follow but it was still intriguing and entertaining.
5,Another home run for Lee Child,"I suppose almost every one who has read a Jack Reacher novel knows what to expect from this ""tough guy"" hero and they will not be disappointed when they read this story. He takes you ""down a different street"" from most crime writers. I really enjoyed this one!"
5,Lee Child is one of the best mystery writers today.,"The Jack Reacher series is fascinating, full of suspense, and exciting! Read the books and skip the movie. Jack Reacher is 6'5"" and can best 3 men. The actor who portrays him in the movie is not and can not. Each book by Lee Child grabs my interest and doesn't let go until the last page."
4,The hard way.,Just another interesting read. Hard to put down. Lee Child's tells a great story that is well researched. Great airplane book.
2,Lame,"I think I've had enough of coffee-drinking, dinosaur Jack Reacher.This guy is kind of a D-bag; but for some reason he always ends up ""showering together"" with some chick.Time for Lee Child to get some better material."
3,Meandered way too much,"It grabbed you right away, a key tenant of Lee Child's writing, but mid way through the book it bogs down. An interesting plot but could have used more editing."
2,slip ons,Unfortunatly no arch in the sole of the shoe which can be uncomfortable if one is going to where for hours. On the bright side this slip on sneaker is good for going out to the store or run aron's for less than an hour. The shoe does have style.
3,Get ready to work,"Perhaps I shouldn't review this video yet after only two workouts with it, but here goes. The first couple of aerobic segments are fairly easy to follow yet get your heart rate elevated. The last segment is also not too complicated. But the segments in the middle are very difficult to follow. Your heart rate will go up while you are learning them, but not as much as they would if you could follow perfectly. I've been doing various aerobic videos (Kathy Smith, Crunch Fat Blaster Plus) regularly for over a year, but I can see I'm going to have to do this tape many times to learn some of these complicated steps! There are a couple I may always have to improvise on. I like it, and the instructor is good, but be ready to be somewhat frustrated, too."
5,Great. I love it.,"Loved it from the very first time I heard it.Sorry but I'm not good at criticising, just say the good things when I see or feel them, the negatives... I never develop.there is too much of that around."
1,Oh Dear,"First off, Im not American, but English, so maybe that affected my judgement, but i hate this song. First off, its massacering an old new year favourite. Cant Cliff think up anything new? Nothing is his own work here. Secondly, he's so unbelievably smug about the song. He said that it applied to all major religions, not just Christianity. how does it do this exactly? Would a christian find meaning in an Islamic Prayer written to music? no, of course not. Its so smug and so fundamentally wrong to say that the principle prayer of one religion would find any meaning to any other religions. Thats why religions are different!This sonbg was recently voted the second worst pop song ever vby Channel Four Viewers in the top 100 worst pop songs ever program. It should have come top.I know this will be unpopular on the American site, but i feel ithat this smug Christian song should be left to rot in history."
5,A CD That Will Lift Your Spirit & Inspire You Each Day,"This CD is a beautiful, inspiring prayer for the New Millennium. Cliff's voice is rich and vibrant. His faith is genuine and believable. The Lord's Prayer is sung to the traditional melody from Scottish poet Robert Burns' famous ""Auld Lang Syne,"" which most of us sing each New Year's. What a lovely combination of faith & tradition. And what better hope for the New Millennium than forgiving others & living in peace. The second single is just as inspiring as it helps us wipe away the tears of life & remember there is a light--there is a power greater than ourselves. For over 40 years, Sir Cliff Richard has produced some of the best music in the world. It's time America embraced this talented, committed, professional singer whose music gives us hope, faith, love, courage, peace, & joy."
4,awkward mesh of music and lyrics,"Yes, number 1 in the UK, and it has the sound of Cliff's other Christmas offerings over the years. The lyrics don't quite work with the tune; you'd think they could have changed them a little more to achieve a better effect. But, with a few listenings it grows on you, and there is some power to the refrain. Well done, this would have been a memorable recording for the millennium. As it is, it is merely pleasant--a refreshing change from whatever popular music is called these days. It's worth buying if only for the novelty value--a religious lyric at number 1 on the charts in post-Christian Britain! Amazing."
5,Good Song,"Not only this is sort of commercial product, but still is the best song of the year. I heard this song from TV's news first, and I can't stop to listen again and again. The lyric is amazing, simple and truth. If the cd is lyric including , that will make it perfect. For someone wants to see the lyric , check out http://www.starnet.com.au/sheppard/prayer.html"
4,"""Whattaya say, whattaya sayyyyyyy...""","FLYING HIGH (1931) - Bert Lahr, Charlotte Greenwood, Pat O'Brien, Charles Winninger, Hedda Hopper, Guy KibbeeIn this star turn, Lahr does his burlesque clown ""nyahn-nyahn-nyahn"" bit (it's not the Cowardly Lion folks, it's his slapstick cop from an old 1920s routine with his wife).Busby Berkeley trots out overhead views of girls in kaleidoscopic formations and O'Brien is his dapper self in this adaptation of the George White (of the famous Scandals) stage production. Pre-code fun in a musical tale of aerocopter inventor Lahr, his forced marriage to Greenwood and their record-breaking 53,000 foot ascent.Recomended for all fans of early Depression Era comedies."
1,Not worth the money,"Unless you want to watch the cowardly lion stitck from Wizard of Oz for over an hour, or are a big fan of seasickness don't bother. Granted the shakiness of the picture did stop after about 10 minutes it didn't improve the movie. The suddenly popped in choreography numbers and a script that didn't flow made me wonder why this one would be put out for a collector when there are so many better ones sitting in dust on shelves. I have an extensive collection of old movies with many from the 30's but I have to say I am disappointed to have purchased this one. The best thing about it was the write up on the back. A lot of promise with no follow through."
1,There are better kits available.,"I have been a "" DeWalt"" user for years, and have been happy the entire time. That is until I purchased the 5 peice kit. It was purchased in September of '02 and I have had to replace the entire kit with the exeption of the recip saw. I doubt i will be making any more DeWalt cordless purchases. There ARE better kits at better prices."
5,beautiful and haunting,"Very cohesive music with an absorbing spirit.My favorite is 'Back From Lunch', which is a tribute to Eric Dolphy that holds its haunting mood."
3,outdoor timer,"Ship time good. Does what it is supposed to for about 6 months then breaks. This is my third one, but it is the only product I've found that can be hard wired outside with a timer for my holiday lights."
2,"4 stars for features, no stars for reliability","Update: Coming up on 1 year after rebuilding it with a GFCI outlet and a standard outlet; unit is still operating as redesigned and I just placed the koi pond back into 'service' for the Spring/Summer/Fall.Original review below.Sun causes the plastic to distort. Install in the shade and it may last longer. The distortion causes the outlets to be flakey; wiggling the plugs around allows them to make contact, but may stop working when the sun comes or goes. So far it hasn't had water leak into it, despite the warping.Since there isn't anything else comparable, I'm gutting my year-old unit. I tested the two switches, photocell and circuitry, and it is all properly functioning. So the problems appear to be just with the poor outlet electrical contact design. I'm removing the GFCI/outlet guts, and I'll cut the housing to allow insertion of a GFCI outlet and a standard outlet. This should correct the problems, and if I provide shade the unit should last."
3,Works fine then breaks.,"Like the other reviews, product works great for about one season then it breaks. A real drag since this seems to be the only one like this on the market."
3,Good for a little while,"Works great for while, but it soon breaks. Took about 8 months for it to break."
3,Not Up to Fight the Tide Level,"This album has 4 songs I enjoy, the other songs, eh. It does grow on you with each listen. But overall, Face of Love is not at the same level as Fight the Tide.An album that is better is The Afters self-titled CD. Do your ears a favor and check it out.Maybe SR will do better next time..."
5,No Risk Involved,"I must admit i was a little hesitant at purchasing this CD. However, upon listen listening to it the CD Rocks!I think this is a good example for CCM to follow. This would prove that Christian music doesn't have to be boring and mundane."
2,Superb!,This album is a must for any music fan ... especially for all you Sanctus Fans out there. The boys have stepped it up another notch and this may be the best yet! I cannot wait to see what the future holds for Sanctus Real. Amazing album ... you will not want to stop listening.
5,Absolutely incredible,"to anyone who has loved sanctus real through the years, This album is no dissapointment.for anyonw who has never heard sanctus real before, this album is a must have.this album shows a new side of sanctus real, as they face some of the more difficult questions of life with an incredible message of hope.this album is lyricaly powerful and will apply to anyone who has ever gone through difficult times and has needed hope."
3,Not as good as the first,"The first cd had more cool sounds and songs to it, but this one seems like a lot more filler songs all listed behind the first song. If it's cheap, buy it, if not, you're not missing a whole lot."
5,Catch them live if you can!,"Just saw Sanctus Real the other night with Steven Curtis Chapman and I was blown away. This is one of the best live bands I've heard in a long time, very talented, great vocals and sound. I loved every song they played including one they say will be coming out on their next album. I knew their songs from the radio but hadn't bought the CD...yet, I definitely will be now. Great band, great lyrics and message, it was awesome worshipping with them!!"
5,Phenomenal,"Sanctus Real's CD The Face of Love certainly belongs in every person's CD collection. Every song is incredibly moving from start to finish. Amazing vocals and music combine with meaningful lyrics to create a heartfelt masterpiece. The songs are personal, and most of us can relate them to our own lives."
5,Sanctus Real at it's BEST!!!,"WOW! Sancuts Real BLEW ME AWAY with their latest album, now i have to be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of their's before, but now after hearing 'Face of Love', I can't WAIT to hear more of this blossoming group! TOTALLY recommended! The pop/rock sound they have is awesome! and the lyrics are so inspiring!"
5,Get this CD,There new Cd is even better then their last Cd. Great growth from last Cd. A must have. This Cd really rocks.
5,AMAZING!,This CD is seriously amazing. I dont know what I would do without it! My two favorite songs are Face of Love and I'm Not Alright. They are all good but those are my two favorites! You should most deffinetly go get this album.Andrew
5,Amazing Group!!,Sanctus Real is a very talented group! I love listening to their music.. this CD is a great follow up from their last release!
3,"Packed with information, but no unifying framework","If you are looking for quick summaries of the various standards and technologies pertinent to home networking, this is a useful book. As mentioned by the other reviewers, it covers almost everything developed or under development. However, comparisons are scanty; the chapters give the impression of having been written independent of each other, even though certain areas might have merited shared treatment. For example, lists of pros and cons are given for network technologies like WiFi, HomeRF, HomePNA, etc without reference to corresponding areas of the others.This would be an excellent book if more had been done to provide some kind of unifying framework."
1,Does this item exist?,"I ordered this Item in Augest and like clockwork I have recieved messages saying it will be delayed 1-2 weeks. It is now November and no tool kit. The Item avalibility is listed at 2-3 days, I DON'T THINK SO. Go to a store where you can walk out the door with it, I am."
1,I will stick with the movie!,"I really wanted to love this book. The Hallmark movie adaptation ""What The Deaf Man Heard"" is one of my FAVORITE movies. Sad to say the book is nowhere near as good as the movie. All the things I love about the movie were nowhere to be found in the book.The book is about Sammy Ayres, a little boy who arrives in Barrington Georgia in 1940 with no idea where his mom is or what happened to her during their bus ride from Birmingham. The plot of the story is Sammy telling his story of what happened over the next 45 or so years, while he's pretending to be deaf and mute since arriving in Barrington. The movie version loosely follows the plot of the book with some major and minor changes. I found the movie to have much more heart and soul than the book. Some of the plot points in the book, I found extremely distasteful.I'll stick with the movie in this case."
1,WHERE IS IT?,"I never received my order #103-3000625-328246, scheduled to be delivered between October 19 and November 3. Today is November 13.PLEASE ADVISE.Virginia Ober"
2,OK for basic speaker cover,This is probably a good design for a basic woofer cover that doesn't have a lot of bass. For the subwoofer I covered the bass shot it off right away. Plus it's a little too shallow and the speaker hit the mesh even when I held it on to see if fastening it would solve the separation problem. It does fit nicely and is a solid design but won't work for woofers that require some movement. So I basically tossed it aside and decided not to cover the speaker since it's behind the rear seat anyway. Would recommend making sure that you consider the movement of the speaker and get a cover with sufficient depth.
5,A remarkable CD,"This is possibly the best and most listened to CD that I own. Quasthoff's artistry is unmatched by any performer I have yet to hear, and his technique is wonderful. I have seen him in concert, and I can say that this recording does do him justice. I especially like his recordings of the arias from Handle's 'Messiah' and the last track from Bach's 'St. Matthew Passion.'"
2,It didn't work for me :-(,"i'm given it 2 stars, because the package came in on time and in perfect condition... however, it didn't work for my old computer... apparently, this specific ram only works for certain motherboards which i already knew, but it was only $5 so i figured i'd give it a try... anyways, kingston makes good ram, i would recommend their products to anyone, just make sure it fits your motherboard."
3,"some problems, but usable","I like this product for its convenience, small size, and good sound quality. The mini-CDs hold about 4 hours of music in MP3 format (128 or 160 k-bit) each, and are very easy to carry around with you. As for the battery problem alluded to by previous reviewers, I solve the problem by using rechareable batteries and carry a couple spares with me.I do have a couple problems: 1) the resume button doesn't work on my machine every since I got it. 2) after a month of use, my player starts shutting off whenever there's a jolt to it or if I drop it into my bag. Perhaps I've not been very careful with it, but the player should be better built than that. I will probably try a different mini-CD player next time, if the problems start to annoy me too much."
2,Get a Compaq PM-1,"I honestly can't recommend this product - not while the Compaq PM-1 is out. Yes, the eXpanium is pretty good, but it lacks major functions - like it can't display ID3 tags, and you can't fast foward (search) through the middle of songs! The PM-1 has an inline remote that displays the ID3 tags, and it has the ability to search. The PM-1 also has 8 MINUTES of shock protection, compared to the 100 seconds offered by the eXpanium. The Compaq also comes with 3 mini CD-Rs to get you started, whereas the Philips comes with only one. Bottom line, the Philips is a solid product, but the Compaq PM-1 has more features for the same price."
4,Long Awaited,Actually Works! Tried Lots Of Other Types Of Players That Did Not.The Only Thing It Is Missing Is An FM Tuner Which Would Then Make It A 10+ In My Book!!
4,Not bad although it could use some work,"I recently bought this item used from ebay. It is a alright mp3 player in fact it has turned out to be jog proof which is good. But sometimes when it plays it says ""ps"" which i'm going to guess means problem scanning then it won't play anything so i have to hit stop then restart it. I haven't had any problems with the battery life it usually runs for about 5 to 6 hours with 1 enegizer battery. The player itself is pretty flimsy but it not a real big problem though. So my advice is if you want a joggable mp3 player and don't mind buying mini cd-r's its a good buy."
1,Great Idea - Needs work.,"Bought this for my wife to use at work; was impressed by the resume ability and 2-minute ESD. The resume ability was for her to listen to long audiobooks; as the resume ability does not work (see review by ""An electronics fan""), that idea is down the drain. Secondly, also mentioned in ""An electronics fan""'s review, the machine turns off if you take a particularly hard step while walking with it in your hand. Pitiful. Will be giving this away and buying a better one."
5,"The perfect little ""music box""!","The other reviwers have mentioned both the pros and cons of the Philips Expanium 8cm mp3 player, so I'll simply add a few words. The sound quality is superb and the portability is wonderful. I've always been very happy with Philips products, and this little mp3 player is now at the top of my Philips list!"
4,"Good screen, great price","Screen was easy to install in my basement - a great alternative to an HDTV that is always on display, this rolls up and quickly converts my media room into a playroom for my three young kids.This is my first screen purchased - without experience with any other screen, I'm happy with the picture I'm getting and the brightness of what's reflected. I'm using a Sharp DT510 projector with the screen."
4,Great screen for the price,"This was a replacement for a cinema grey Elite screen that broke. The Elite cost over twice as much, but this screen is better in pretty much every way. Far fewer waves, and it gives a better picture (projector is a Mitsubishi HC5500)."
5,Accuscreen,This is my first BIG screen. I was working on a tight budget so I was only considering manual screens. This was very affordable and prefect size for the space I had. I was also impressed with delivery. My screen was delivered within 2 days on standard shipping. When I first installed it the smell was as advertized... aweful! Was soon as you get one I suggest hanging it outside (garage) for about 24 hours to get the smell out. It was very easy to hang and the screen image is great. I use it with a 1080i projector for XBOX and TV and the picture is as good as my 720p plasma TV.
2,Handyman's delight,"The screen material is high quality, it's bright and well reflecting. But the housing assembly is terrible, it only lasted maybe 40 pull-downs after which the spring jumped off the rod, and the screen completely separated from it's housing.Now, the good news is that it's fixable. Looking at the design and implementation, I see a definite possibility of this thing breaking again, however, I already designed a plan how to make it completely manual, and also it would stop at precise heights.Well, the screen is cheeper than its peers, produces high quality reflections, but you may have to spend a little time to fix and modify it. Good luck."
1,AWFUL SOUND QUALITY,"I don't care how rare a record is, if it's in bad shape it should not be used as master material for a CD. Fully 20 of these 29 songs are unlistenable because the records they were taken from had been played too many times using very worn phonograph needles. The vocals on most of these tracks have that murky, raspy quality you get when a record is just plain worn out. What's surprising, though, is that this is not the case with volumes one and three of this series, which I recommend.Frankly, the production is bad enough on these garage obscurities without adding even more distortion."
1,A poorly researched tale,"This book is a joke.For evidence of how poorly researched this book is, simply GOOGLE the authors name and title of the book and you will find a copy of the London Court's libel judgement against the author and various gripes from the authors ""footnoted"" interviewees who claim they were misquoted or that quotes were simply made up. One American Moscow correspondent even claims in his paper that the author used strong anti-semitic slurs when discussing Berezovsky.If the publishers want to stick by their author, that's fine, but the public record and the English libel verdict as to this books accuracy is clear for all to see. Use Google."
1,Slander,"I'm surprised this book is still being sold after the English courts upheld the subject libel suit and the author was forced to admit he'd made much of this silly tale up. Well, in any event, it's still being sold here. The story reads like excerpts from the latest National Enquirer except that the Enquirer actually has to pass their stuff by fact checkers and libel lawyers!"
1,Story didn't hold up in court,"This book didn't make a solide case for me, nor, apparantly was it solidly researched. This week, in a London courtroom, the author's own lawyers were forced to concede that this portrayal was an invention by the author in order to stop the longstanding libel suit brought by Berezovsky. So, now that the author has been disavowed in court, will the book be pulled? Let's see. The story of the book is almost more interesting--and sad--than the corruption it supposedly was trying to expose."
1,Paul Klbnikov murdered in Moscow.,"Report: Editor of Russian Forbes KilledBy THE ASSOCIATED PRESSMOSCOW (AP) -- Paul Klebnikov, the editor of Forbes Magazine's Russian edition and author of a book about tycoon Boris Berezovsky, was shot to death late Friday in Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported.The report cited Moscow police as saying Klebnikov suffered four pistol shots and died in a rescue-squad vehicle."
1,RIP Paul Klebnikov,"I'm afraid folks are going a little overboard in rewriting history to celebrate a murdered friend or colleague. This book illustrates a flawed reporter willing to bend the truth and ethics for a story. That, pure and simble, is why Forbes lost the libel suit brought on by Berezovsky. Even more alarmingly this book seems to have been written by someone trying to emulate traditional prejudices the White Russian aristocracy that he so much wanted to join. Amongst the ex-pat circle in Moscow, Klebnikov's embarrasing anti-Jewish outbursts earned him the moniker ""Progrom Paul.""Although noone really should have taken this writer too seriously, someone out there apparantly did, and that's the tragedy of this story. RIP Paul Klebnikov. Noone deserves to be murdered for being a poor reporter."
3,True hero,"He is a real Russian hero and ironically an American. Honest and fearless, he was doing it all for Russia which he truely loved. My condolences go to his family, people who knew and understood Paul...."
1,Hell Hath No Fury Like A Journalist Sued,"One of the silliest hate fests I've ever seen in print. Berezovsky is known as a shady character, but this book goes over the top. Getting sued by Berezovsky was probably a rough thing for the author, but this hot-headed book is so aggressive in its accusations that one half expects to read that Berezovsky was behind the Stalin Show Trials, quelching the Prague Spring, and pushing that baby carriage down the steps in Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potempkin!"" As an economist who is intimate with some of Russia's privatisation efforts over the past decade, I don't buy this extremist view of Berezovsky. I'm certainly glad I didn't have to buy this book (the perks of academia)."
4,The outlook from America,The Paul Klebnikov book has been very helpful in the perspective to understand American view of Russian policy . I can say that the way Russians see it is a little bit different from the one propossed by the author. I couldn't find any reliable facts to believe everyhting written in the book but still I came to understand much more about post-soviet Russia than i did before. Shocking revelations of the famous people in Russia got me numb. In the chapter describing the reasons (possible reasons) of Listyev's murder I found a new perspective in lookong at the most terrible murder in the new Russia. I would recommend the book to everyone who are longing for an easy reading combined with interesting outlook of the modern Russia.
2,Not so fun!,"I bought these for my daughter when she was 7 months old because she was so interested in my keys. Although she took to these right away, she, like other babies, gets quite excited when holding something interesting. When she throws her arms in the air, the keys can come right back and hit her in the face. It has happened a few times now and I can only give her one key at a time now so she doesn't hurt herself. These would be much nicer if they were soft and not hard plastic. Definately not for the active ones!"
1,Baby's finger got jammed in the toy !,"My friend said buy something branded as other toys have lead etc. So i picked up Fisher price. The toy description said 3Months plus. Our baby is 7 months old already. We all liked the toy and we were happy with the purchase. So the next day when the baby was playing with it.. it started screaming with pain. We were stunned and unsure what could have happened. The baby's finger was still attached to the toy. The blue one which moves up and down. We somehow got the baby's finger out without damage. Please be very careful about Fisher price toys.Fisher Price has many types of activity keys. Hence if you are planning to buy the one which has the blue key moving up and down, then beware.."
2,Not quite what I expected.,The batteries were dead out of the box so the musical key has never worked. Also the Ring separates so the keys do not stay on the ring at all. My son is 7 months old and has sown no interest in these whatsoever.They are also VERY big! One key is almost the size of my hand.
3,It's Okay,"I bought this toy for my 12 month old son. We decided to give it away as a present to a 4 month old. It is very ""babyish"" and boring. It had bright colors and some cute tunes, but not that entertaining for an older child."
3,The music key is great - the rest are just okay,"My son is 15 months and he still gets a kick out of the blue music key. He likes to press buttons and this one is no exception. He doesn't pay much attention to the red or yellow keys and never really did.I do have to agree with the other reviewers that the keyring is super flimsy. The keys haven't been on the ring since about 2 days after bringing this home. I would reccomend this toy for babies a little older than the ""3 months and up"" the box says."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"I was super excited to bring this toy home to my daughter (age 5 months.) I bought it at Kmart (was only about 8 bucks there).I was really disappointed with the flimsy ring, as my intention was to link this to her stroller and high chair table. The ring absolutely will not withstand any movement, and barely holds the keys together, as is. As other reviewers stated, the keys are fine separately, but that is not why I chose this toy. So, if you are okay with using the key separated, then this is an okay toy - but if you are looking to buy it for hanging on things or if you want the keys to remain together, then this is not a good toy."
5,Terrific for crawling baby,"This is a great toy for a baby 8 months and older. It is apparently labeled for younger babies, and although it is safe for them, it is difficult for them to enjoy. If you have a 4 month old, get them a Bumper Jumper instead.Why should these toy keys be appealing to a baby aged 8 to 14 months? It probably has something to do with the fact that there is just enough challenge in attempting to handle the keys to make it intriguing. Also, there are numberous contours to feel and gum that are interesting to this age baby."
5,She loves them,"My 6 month old daughter received this toy as a Christmas present and she loves them. The only drawback is the white ring that keeps the keys on comes undone easily and the keys go flying. She likes to pick them up and turn them over, push the music button, and of course they go in her mouth too. I didn't think they were too heavy."
2,Cute but not Worth It,"My daughter loves my keys, so I set out to buy her a set of her own. I went to the local toy store and had a choice of two. I picked Fisher Price keys over the Parent Magizine Keys because the keys on the parents one were a little hard and felt like the real thing. I thought the Fisher Price keys were great, well in the box. I got them home and gave them to my then 5 month old. She could care less about them because they were too big and bulky and the blue key that makes all the noise is extreemly sensitive. I can't keep it in the diaper bad without it making a loud ""ding-dong"", ""Honk-Honk"", etc. I'm sure this would be a great product if FP could make them a little smaller and an on off switch for the ""Loud Blue Key""."
3,heavy product but good quality,these are nice quality but they are a bit heavy for my daughter who is 5 months. I have taken them off the ring and use them separate which is nice and she will play with them well. The music isn't very long but not many toys are in this small of a product.
4,Gift,"This ""Shut the Box"" was a Christmas gift for my grandson (age 6) who loves numbers. We have played it and played it, and played it - a real hit for a kid who loves video games and playing ball outside. His younger sister (age 4) has also enjoyed playing. She needed a little help initially, but now ""wants to do it herself"" and we are excited that she is learning addition, etc. too. My husband and I have really enjoyed the game, too.I would recommend this for almost all ages."
1,Rip-off pamphlet (not a book),"Poor and unethical. This grocery store horoscope size pamphlet tells how to cheat the Dept. stores, too. Must do this every month. Book not recommended. 1/2 star. Hey Northridge, CA... your right around the corner from me!"
1,I Wouldn't Recommend This Pamphlet Even @ Gunpoint,"This ""book"" consisted of only 24 pages, and the pages were off-centered at that. Nonetheless, I have always thought that one should never judge a book by its cover. After reading the pamphlet, I knew that the quality of the pamphlet (or rather, lack therof, was consistant with the content).I could have easily put together a more informative pamphlet, with better information (e.g., Credit Card companies that actually offer a 20-25 day grace period on Balance Transfers). Now this is the kind of information that I would pay for, and that quite frankly, I thought that I would be getting from this selection.Best Advice: How to Pay Zero Dollars for this Pamphlet -- Steer Clear Here"
1,no CD,"This edition does NOT include a CD. Based on other reviews, I had assumed that I would receive a CD with fillable legal forms."

3,Love Dewalt but this compressor has problems,"I bought it in mid 2003 when it arrived it was leaking oil. A few months after that we had it back to service because it would die as soon as it got under pressure. I only used it a few days a week to winterize houses. It got used about 5-6 hours of use a week for only 6 months of one year. After sitting 3 years due to an accident I was in, when I went to use it again it wouldn't hold pressure. I took it to the repair center it's a cracked manafold. Considering it has had little use I am not impressed for the $700 I spent."
5,Dewalt gas powered compressor - great!,"I'm using this gas powered compressor out in the field to power a T-Post driver when I'm building fence. It starts with one or two pulls and does everything Dewalt claims it will do. I can't really find any faults with it at all. It's well thought out and well designed. If you need a light weight, gas powered air compressor, you can't go wrong with this one."
1,poor user interface,The manual says that this can remember the last 5 disks played and the last viewed scenes. This is not true. If you rotate between three disks it will forget where in each you last viewed and start you off at a random location. If you rotate between four it will forget that you even watched them and start you off as if they were new disks at the beginning.There is no slow forward or reverse. You have to pause and single step.On some commercially recorded DVDs the image will vibrate vertically when there is sharp brightness changes. On some there will be horizontal lines (like the IBM trademark) on text.The 504 model that came out later does not have these problems.
5,Sassy and fun!,"This is a very fun read. It's light, it's breezy, its funny, its sexy...it's just plain fun. This would make such a fun movie...and be a nice change from the bazillion remakes being endlessly pumped out by Hollywood."
1,Recipie Changed... tangy vinegar taste... do not like...,"I'm 54 years old, I've been eating Nalley Original Chili for about 44 years. The last cans I bought are ""different""... different can, and it tastes more tangy, with a vinegar taste, reminds me of ketchup. I will no longer buy Nalley Chili, the end of an era... it's sad.I called Nalley, they have no record that the recipe has changed, but trust me it has changed for the worse."
1,New recipe makes for bad chili,This is been my favorite chili for the last 12 years. Other than homemade I've never had anything is good. They have seem to recently switched their recipe and now I have to strain the chili before heating it up.
2,Bad Quality Control,"I really like this drill's features and power, and the weight is not a problem with me either. My problem is with the chuck that wobbles. I use one of these drills at my job so I wanted one for my own use at home. I thought I bent the drill at work until I bought one for myself two weeks ago. It wobbled right out of the box. I took it back and the other one did the same. I am taking it back and have since ordered a Milwaukee 0524-24 18 volt. I could only recommend this drill if DeWalt comes to their senses and fixes what is obviously not an isolated problem. Until then they should change their name to DeWobble."
1,Power. Performance. If only it could drill a straignt hole.,"This is one powerful tool. I've waited for it's release and finally purchased one at a local store [....] I'm on my 4th one now. They all have the same problem - the chusk is not plum, level, straignt, whatever you want to call it. The result is that the bit wobbles. A 1/8"" hole winds up at 3/16. Drilling a 1/16 hile in metal snaps the bit. The wobble is so bad that it's almost painful to drill 2"" bore holes. The bit is forces to go in straight because it's just so darn big. This causes the boby of the drill to wobble crazilly.I'm going to exchange it one more time next week - I tried today, but all 6 that were in stock were also defective! Then it's refund time. Bottomm line - wait a few months until the bugs are worked out."
2,"Nice high speed, but...","Well, I don't personally own one of these drills, but my boss has one, and I've used it quite a bit. It's certainly a big improvement over DeWalt's earlier 18 volt drills, but like others have said, quality seems to be lacking. I love the 2,000 rpm high speed, and the drill does have plenty of torque. The spindle/shaft that the chuck is attached to seems rather loose...Not long after this particular drill's first birthday, something went wrong inside. Now the drill acts as if the battery is almost dead, even though it's actually freshly charged. Disappointing. The other problem we're having is with the chargers- three of them have quit working so far. (Boss had bought some other DeWalt cordless tools) The red light on one of them blinks even if the charger isn't plugged in.I'll go along with some of the other reviews here and recommend Milwaukee."
1,Lasted 4 months and then problems...,"This was a great drill for 4 months and no wobble problems for me. But then I had to drill (50) 2-inch holes in pretty tough, old 2x4s and at about hole 35, the clutch started to slip at low speed. (It was a low-speed drill bit.) So I went up a speed and 2 holes later, it just chattered and stopped drilling, so then I went to high speed, which is really wrong for this particular bit. I barely made it to the end of the 50 holes, but, clearly, this drill has a design problem in the clutch, assuming this is what went wrong. I paid a lot of money for this drill to get quality and it didn't deliver. Other reviewers suggest another brand and another drill. Right now, it's in the shop so we'll see, but I smoked a corded drill by DeWalt a while back, so I'm more than wary about DeWalt tools."
5,Outstanding drill! You won't be disappointed.,"I have had this drill for 4 months now and it does everything you could ask for in cordless drill. Incredible torque, long battery life, a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. I generally prefer PC tools, but I like this DeWalt. So far I can find no fault in it. Mine has absolutly no runout in the chuck. Isolated problem?"
3,Have they fixed the problem?,I rated the drill 3 stars inorder to get this posted. Has DeWalt fixed the wobble problem? Are the new drills that are shipping now improved? Please post if you have info.
2,Get a Bosch,"I purchased the drill along with the Dewalt cordless reciprocating saw last November. The drill started going down the tubes within a couple of months. Sometimes I couldn't rotate the clutch to the next speed, sometimes the trigger wouldn't depress, somtimes the clutch wouldn't rotate into the drill position. It was very apparent that there was something hanging up the works. I sent it out for service last week. I bought a pair of Bosch drills to replace the Dewalt and my old Porter Cable drills which gave me 6 years of good service but needed new batteries. The Bosch are the smoothest, most comfortable and best layed out drills I've ever owned; including the nice case with removable bit case inside."
3,$269 wobble,I had recieved one as a gift last christmas. I didn't notice the wobble to much at first only using a certian long shafted driver. Then it seemed to get progressivly worse with time. After a year I finaly had enough and took it in. The repair quy messed around with it for a week and put a new trany in and some other stuff. Did it under warranty but didn't seem to realy fix any thing. I use Bosch 24v at work and those chucks spin true and we beat the snot out of them as electricians. Just be warry of the wobbly chuck
4,"Muy bueno, pero hay otros mejores de Charlie Cruz","Saludos desde México!!!. Charlie Cruz es uno de mis artistas favoritos. Sin embargo, de este album solo 3 canciones cubrieron mis espectativas (y fueron la razon por la que compré el CD): Dile que la amo (triste pero buena), mi corazón (muy explosiva) y dejala que baile (su versión salsa es buena, pero la salsaton es la mejor). El resto son canciones mas o menos (como de 6 o 7). Pero bueno, este artista tiene muchas otras canciones excelentes en otros albumes, principalmente el ""Dinamico"" y ""Sigo aqui"". De paso les recomiendo a Michael Stuart, Frankie Negron, NG2 entre muchos otros. Hasta pronto!!!"
2,suckish,i got this for my lil brother for his trick or treating and 2 hours later his pants ripped. poor quality
4,He liked it!,"Hubby liked the bass trainer. I suggest that you order the AC adapter. I didn't realize that it was a battery only device and he had to order it after Christmas. It's a little flimsy, made all of plastic."
5,Not just for reptile enclosures,"This stuff is GREAT for HOUSEHOLD CLEANING!! I have used it on mirrors, bathroom sinks, kitchen counters, wood tables to remove hardened jelly etc. IT WORKS WONDERS!!My roommate is male and all that gunk from the shaving lotion as well as the toothpaste residue that collects in the sink, this stuff made it disappear and gave my sink a great shine as well, the faucets with their hard water stains and the gunky brown stuff that collects in crappy apt fixtures, 80% gone with NO SCRAPING!! This stuff cleans the outside of aquarium glass and acrylic to crystal clear perfection as well.DUMP YOUR CHEMICALS AND USE THIS!!"
5,it works! clean the turtle tank,"turtle is still alive so it must work as designed. spray to clean the sides of the tanks, scrub with sponge and all gone."
3,Great but late,Hello the book was great when I finally got the book. The book took forever to come but when it did it was in good condition.
4,Common tactics & Common sense for common people!,"This book is for everyone who ever has been a victim or feels they are about to be. Dirk Skinner's book is down to earth and very low key which helps readers understand an get right to the point. It spots and defines the streangths and weaknesses in other martial arts with out making ninjutsu seem ""almighty"". I highly recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out or adept in self-defense tactics and/or martial arts.Truly a fantastic book!"
2,go read a stephen k hayes book instead,"You would be better off reading stephen K hayes 5 book series on the ninja. I got this as a gift when I was in jr. high and even then i knew i had read better. Admittedly there is nothing in the diagrams wrong enough to get you killed but i think the whole ""off the highway"" concept can only be shown in motion. Otherwise your balance will fail you. And no vigilate stuff this book refers to either."
2,Suckered in Again,"This book provides little help in navigating the mean streets of any cities. Why the author took it upon himself to draw the pictures himself is beyond me. This book is cartoony, and pretty much a waste of money. I regret having bought this book, but what can you do? Instead of buying this, get something on a tangible martial art (not karate or tae kwon do), enter that class, and then work on it. But don't buy this book. Please, don't buy this book."
3,"Cheap plastic, weak joints!","This version is much more appealing than the purple version and should have been released as the regular version. However, it has the same problem as all of the Marvel Legends line, inferior plastic! So if you buy this and open it, be very, very, very careful with all of the joints! I was and I still managed to bust her arm of of the shoulder piece!. Be careful."
3,"Ok, but not great..","These were a Christmas ""Stocking stuffer"" for my 8 month old last year, since she wasn't old enough for candy or traditional stocking stuffers. They have received that same level of importance in her toy box: just extra little somethings she looks at for a minute here or there but never the ""main event."" She prefers plain old colored blocks that she can easily stack over these. Also, the decals on them have started to peel off with limited play (although I do clean her toys with a slightly dampened rag occasionally, so this may have contributed to the problem.)"
3,entertaining,My 7 month old can sit quitely while watching me press the head of the blocks. The only disadvantage is that it's a hard toy.
2,Boring...,"We bought this toy thinking it was fun...totally not. My son (7 months) is not impressed with this toy at all. Right when he sees it, he throws it on the floor. It looks like it should be fun with all the door and rolling parts, but it is not."
4,Educationals stacking blocks,I was a little disappointed in this product. There really wasn't much to it.
1,Don't bother,"I bought these for my daughter when she was 7 months old. The only thing she ever did with them then was lay on her back to hold them (one at a time) and look at them. Then she would drop it on her head--these are hard, and it would hurt! At 2 1/2 years old the activities on these blocks are still too hard for her to manipulate. Despite the fact that she has a younger sister, this is one toy that is on its way to the thrift store. There are too many good toys out there for little ones to bother with these."
2,Not for Little Ones,This is meant for a baby/toddler toy but I don't get why at all. I had 3 different kids under 2 play with these and none of them could really push the head down when they were all stacked up. The stickers also come off really easily and can be eaten by a small child. My daughter ate part of one. I don't think this toy was designed well. Small hands can't really manipulate these.
4,Fun for little hands!,"These were passed down to us (along with a similar one from mcdonalds) and I pulled them out of a box when my son was 6 months old. He loves playing with these blocks. As he's gotten older, he's been able to interact with the toys more. They fit well in his hands and hold up to him throwing them, hitting them against things, stacking them, and biting them."
2,not fun,The quality is just ok. My 9-month-old son doesn't like it. It's not that fun as the picture shown on the website.
2,Not the Best Block Set,"My daughter was possbily least enthused about this set of blocks out of anything that I have purchased for her. They are interesting in theory and idea, but in practice they're a bit disappointing. They're not super easy to stack and the different little features are not very easy for little hands manipulate. I thought perhaps that they were too old for her but at nearly a year and able to do puzzles, she's still not interested in them! Not my top recommendation in blocks!"
4,Fun for Baby,"I found these brand new at a garage sale for 50 cents! My 7 month old son loves them, although I have to hold them steady when they are stacked on top of each other for him to play with. I would definitely buy them again and would pay far more than my garage sale price!"
3,Stacking blocks,"I bought these blocks for my one year old, and she likes them. I wish that they would stack better. They dont really fit well and they fall off of each other. BUT she likes them alot."
3,"Doesn't come as pictured, but still great toy!","In the picture, the blue block has a black and white sticker/design on the part that moves - which is something eye catching for baby...but when mine arrived, it is plain, with no sticker. This is still a fun, fun, fun, fun toy for getting babies attention - highly recommend it, just wish they would update their pictures!!"
3,baby ignores them,"I like this product very much,but my baby doesn't share my opinion with me. I bought it when he was few months old and now he is 16 months old.He never cared to even look at it,although it has a few fun activities (again, in my opinion). these blocks are bright colored, funny looking but I guess every baby is different and my baby just ignores them , so I play with them myself........"
4,Red one is in the top 10 of fav toys,"~the RED ""B/2"" block is one of his favorite toys (while the ""A/1"" block is simply ok and the ""C/3"" block is kind of lame).~As far as independent play goes, the only part of the blocks that are worth anything are the spinning parts.~But, I believe the spinny parts are still good for building fine motor skills during independent play time.~And the spinny side is the only thing neat about these blocks... the other 3 sides of the blocks are pretty lame... I think FP could have done better.~ When help him play with them (like stack all three together) he's amazed that all three blocks spin together.~So overall, worth it I think.... but then again, I paid a dollar for them at a garage sale"
3,Sits in the toy box,"My 9mo daughter is super curious about everything. She is the type of baby that you can hand her just about anything to entertain her for a while. I thought that these would be very entertaining for her but she does not play with them at all. So, these have been sitting in the toy box for the last 2 months. She finds an empty pop bottle more interesting to play with."
5,Colorful and Fun Blocks,"These blocks are a colorful, fun and safe product for little ones. They are entertaining and are easy for little ones to hold. My great niece loves them!"
2,There are better things to read,"Silly. Trite. Find something better to read. I always finish a book, but I was tempted many times to put this one down and walk away."
2,predictable,"One of the most predictable books I've ever read. Same dilemma chapter after chapter, ending exactly where I knew it would. All the characters became unlikable by the end. Boring!"
2,Did not like this,The characters were not likable. Too much holding on to the past making the characters shallow and insecure. Just not a good read.
4,liked,i really liked this book it was a cute story and a book that i could lose myself in and i gave it foud stars cause i like it
2,Boring,"Interesting plot line, but written into a very boring book. I liked the heroine, but was frustrated her at the same time."
3,Not captivating enough,"I will try this author again because the writing was fine, but the characters in this story are not likeable and left me flat, except for Jimmie the photographer. Too bad he was just a side character."
3,Not my cup of tea,I got this kindle book for free but really wasn't worth the time spent reading it. I found it difficult to get into the story and the characters confusing
2,Disappointing,"Did not care for the heroine Alli at all. She was full of insecurities of her own making. Yes, she had early trauma in her life but so did her sister. She was hard to root for -- I wanted a different ending. The love triangle was not interesting. I knew exactly how it would end after reading the first 50 pages. Sometimes that is not a bad thing, but here it was."
5,Brilliantly Crafted!,"The best story that I've read in a very long time. The characters, Alli, Sam, and Tessa were developed with perfection around the complexity of their relationship. It was easy to love each them for different reasons. Alli, so honest and self-punishing; Sam, sincere, confused, yet endearing; and Tessa, trying to find who she is. I highly recommend this book because the style of writing and the beautifully told story."
1,Believeable but not likeable,"I did not care for the characters; Sam blames his wife, Ali, for the mistake he made years ago while he as drunk and upset with his real love Tessa and slept with Ali and got her pregnant then married her to be noble, but then when Ali decides to divorce him years later he suddenly sees her in a new light and finds her irresistable? Really? And Tessa, supermodel beautiful still pines for Sam after all these years yet never once tried to contact him all those years? The sisters Grandmother who is the glue to the family dynamic has a stroke and everyone is thrown together again to figure out how they feel about each other. While the characters certainly ring true to how some people act, I couldn't stand them long enough to get through the book! Don't recommend it to anyone, unless you like unlikeable, annoying characters in your romance novels. But, what do you expect for a book that's free."
2,A Life Time soap opera show,"There was to much conversation between characters & not enough story. I was more interested in the grandmothers life when she was young and how her love story might have been. It seemed to babble on with repeating the cause of their feud, people to busy making snide remarks back & forth & taking way to long to share their feelings. yawn.I skimmed thru pages just to finish.This book might remind you of the Life Time channel stories - you leave the tv on and do housework, go back to the tv & think - ""oh, this is still on?"" Haven't thought much about the book after reading. Maybe just not my style of reading?"
2,very weak plot,"This was very droll and lacked the ""page turning"" I had anticipated from the preview. It just seemed too routine and didn't have any flare.I cannot recommend."
5,Perfect,"This book was honestly adorable and very realistic. Its a good read, I couldn't put the book down even though i had class the next day haha"
4,"HERE WE GO AGAIN! <Oct.13,2011>","Why do all these stories,lately,have both parents dying in car accidents? This was irritating enough to distract from this story. Ms. Freethy is really quite good in telling a story."
3,predictable,"I bought this book for no charge so it was a bargain! As my first book on my new Kindle e-reader, I wasn't overjoyed by the book, but wanted to try out my device! It was very predictable, but I guess I'm not really a romance reader anyway."
2,BORING! SKIP SKIP SKIP,"The most boring book ever, it's free but it's boring. Conversation conversation and more conversation, nothing in depth and I even see typo there."
2,Just couldnt get started,"I started reading this, and it just didnt click with me. The story line seemed interesting but I just couldnt catch on to it."
3,Just the Way You Are,Good book. It kept my interest. Barbara Freethy seems to make her writing real. I would recommend it to my friends.
4,good story,"True to Freethy's style, this book has interesting charcters and plot. There are the usual romantic struggles and family issues."
3,Just the Way You Are,"I really had a good time reading ""Just the Way Youare"". It was thoroughly enjoyable, and I will read more books from this author."
4,Fun quick book,Easy quick read. Easy to get caught up in the story. Great character twists and problem resolution. Had a hard time putting the book down.
3,A good beach read,"This book is the perfect beach companion! Started it the night before our flight down south to one of the most pristine beaches in the country; finished before the end of the day.Like many a good romance novels, this is not just about the love between a man and a woman; it speaks about old love, young love, a mother's love, sisterly love, love awakening, love that lasts a lifetime and beyond. This most common universal theme is probably the main reason why romance novels endure.Romantic fiction is certainly not for everyone, but those who enjoy them like I do know that it is almost as real as one's life can be. The simplistic themes and the subconscious admittance by the reader that ""it can really happen"" are what (in my opinion) make them bestsellers."
3,Just the way you are,I found this an interesting and good reading. Kept me wanting to finish the book quickly to see how the story planned out. Easy to read though and not too hard to follow the plot.
2,Skipped through most of it.,"This book seemed like a good idea, before I read it. Would definitely not recommend it to anyone. Its page after page going on about how Alli felt 9 / 10 years ago. I gave it two stars because even though I skipped through the the book, I did read some of it."
5,Couldn't put the book down!,"This was my first read by Barbara Freethy, and I just bought three more of her books. This story was heart wrenching at times. I couldn't turn my kindle off because the end of each chapter left you craving for what would happen next. Truly a fantastic read, and you want so badly to experience the love that Sam and Allie have when they make love. Loved it!!"
2,Sappy,"This is total Hallmark movie material. No twists, poor editing, and I pretty much could guess the ending. Super light; only recommended for a breezy beach read."
3,A nice romance,"I enjoyed this novel, but it wasn't one of my favourites of Barbara Freethy. Nice easy reading for a beach holiday."
4,Easy Read,"This is one of the first books that I downloaded onto my Kindel being new to the Kindel family. I found it to be easy to read and all in all enjoyed the book. It's a fairly short story based on Love and family , allthough there were no real twists , and you kind of know how its going to end , something to read if you like Mills and Boons"
3,A quick read,"I enjoyed the story but for some reason I felt like something was missing and I think it was the ease with which Sam was loved by both women yet he seemed to be plain. He was just some guy and and I don't understand why he was the reason for family strife. His personality was much too effiminate, indecisive and emotional, and I missed the masculine side of him. However, it was a nice storyline and a quick read."
4,try this for a good read,It is a very goood story. I am enjoying reading it on my new Kindle. If you like romance and drama this is the book for you.
4,Just the Way You Are,I loved it and could not put it down. It was very easy reading and felt close to the characters in the book. I have never read any of Barbara Freethy's books before and will now download more on my Kindle. I really enjoyed it.
3,"Entertaining, but story is just ok","This a good book as for as a ""romance novel"" goes. Didn't love the story, but it kept my interst and was well written."
4,Sweet and Simple,"Just The Way You Are is simply wonderful. The book has multiple spelling errors, but nothing to affect the story line too much. Unfortunately, the book is somewhat one note. This book kind of lacks highs, lows, and a climax. Even with the lack of depth, it was a fun, easy read I couldn't put down. I would recommend to anyone looking for a love story that you can fall in love with"
5,"Best shoe ever made (Timeless, Classic)",This is one of the best shoes ever made. I love the Stacy Adams shoes and have worn them with pride over the years.
2,These Shoes Squeak,"These shoes look nice but, even after significant wear, the leather squeaks. I was walking down the hall in our plushly carpeted office and each pause in the conversation with my colleague was filled with the sound of my squeaky shoes. I found myself nervously talking more--and more loudly--to drown out the loquacious leather. Sigh . . .If you decide to pair these with some earplugs and buy them anyway, be forewarned that they also run large. I wear a 10.5 and had to purchase a 9.5 in this shoe."
5,"Stacy Adams Men's Madison Cap Toe Oxford, White","Got these for my husband, who is a Rabbi and does destination weddings all over the world, so these shoes were exactly what he needed to complete his wardrobe - which is mostly white. He says they are very comfortable, too."
2,Picture is darker than actual shoe,"Received my shoe in two days...as promised. However, as others have indicated, these shoe run narrow. If you are a D width or more, look for another shoe. Also, the color of the shoe did not match the ""brown"" picture. Shoe is much lighter than the picture indicates. I thought I was getting a dark brown but the shoe is a medium brown."
5,Too bad they didn't fit :(,Beautiful quality shoes but too narrow for my fat feet. Customer service was excellent and return was without hassle. I would highly recommend this seller to anyone with normal feet looking for an excetional quality shoe for the price.
2,Stacy Adams Men's Madison Cap Toe Oxford,I orderd the grey and brown shoes for my fiance. He is supposed to wear the grey shoes at our wedding next year. The tip of one of the grey shoes was scratched and part of the leather had pealed off. The website said leather upper and leather insole. In actual fact the insole of the shoe says MANMADE INSOLE. This is false advertising! I am very disappointed! We could have purchased better quality shoes for less. I'm not happy at all. Now I have to go through the trouble and expense of sending them back. Never again!
1,Terrible Shoes,These shoes are terrible. They have worn out and split after only a few months of wearing. The soles are coming off the bottom of the shoe. I will never order this brand again.
2,Weak sound quality.,"Unfortunately I was disappointed with the sound quality of this vinyl re-issue by Friday Music. The sound has no vinyl clarity, warmth and depth. The same I can tell about Friday Music re-issue of Deep Purple ""In Rock"" album on vinyl that was released this year. They both sound no better than the CDs."
5,Spend the extra few dollars on a Yumicron,"My old battery held a charge fine and cranked my bike over no problem but when it got really cold, around 30 degrees, it would not start it for anything. The voltage drop would be too high to fire the coils and it would flood out. This Yumicron is specially designed to produce higher cold cranking amps than a standard lead acid battery of this size and capacity, and it delivers in spades. My thirty year old motorcycle starts up immediately without fail regardless of the weather conditions. Like the other reviewer mentioned, don't be turned off by the omission of battery acid, my local auto parts store carries pre-mixed acid in the quantity required for only $3.99. Contrast that to the fact that they charge well north of $100 for a comparable battery, and you'll see this is the best value you can get."
3,Fresh to a point...,"There's a lot of music out there today which boasts a Celtic theme or flavor but really falls into the ambient ""new age"" slot. That's where Breath of Fresh Air should probably go.Of course, it's hard for any music featuring bagpipes, uilleann or otherwise, to be truly ambient. I think maybe the idea was good but, along the way, the concept became a little confused.It's definitely something new, neither traditional nor purely ambient. Whether or not it's successful ... well, that depends on whether you enjoy ambient music that's not really meant to stay in the background. Personally, I prefer something a little more intentionally intrusive."
3,We have used these for 7 years now,"We use the door/window sensors for our X10 alarm that we bought 7 years ago.Good:*They are small*They use AA batteries.. which is great... if a battery needs replaced it is cheap and you most likely already have them at home.* They are easy to install, you can screw in or use the double sided tape they come with.* We have used our sensors for 7 years now and have yet to replace one due to any reason.Bad:* I learned this by accident but if someone like your teenager wants to take the batteries out and then open the window it will not alert the main alarm console!!! The light will blink and that is it!!!!!! Also this is bad for intruders!!!* AA batteries do not have the life of those small expensive ones so be prepared to replace the batteries every few months!"
5,Shannon Noll - True Blue Aussie,"I LOVED this CD. It was so amazing. Such a great recording of Shannon's talent. I particularly loved Drive, although I had heard it before at his concert.There is a huge debate going on over who is the best talent, Shannon or Guy. I think after you listen to this album, the answer will be clear. I found this CD to be money well spent and I'm sure you will too."
2,hrmmm......,"I was looking forward to this album but unfortunately the lyrics on the album are very, well, boring and uninteresting""I've got a car, I've got a big black shiny car""Not a great opening for a cd in my opinionAlot won't agree with me this album really isn't worth the money, same with Guy's album.Spend your money on cold chisel or living"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Folks, don't buy this book. They provide it FREE in every room at the Napili Kai. If you're going, just wait and get your FREE copy. Can't believe people have the nerve to take something from a room and then try to turn around and make a profit."
2,Think about the future,"This drive kept me happy for four years. Yesterday, while the computer wasn't being used, I came home to find the blue screen of death; corrupt partition table. Attempted to repair it, only to reboot to the ominous ""click click click"" referenced at several places that offer to retrieve your data for $850 or so. I'm happy I make backups. (The drive can not be repaired - it's toast. Only physical repair will allow retrieval of the data.)Four years may seem like a long time, but catastrophic failures like this seem common with these drives at around this age point, and they make saving a few bucks on the front end less than worthwhile.This is the second Western Digital drive I've had fail on me. (The first one came installed in an IBM laptop.) Maybe I keep my computers too long. Maybe I should have drawn a conclusion from the first one. I've certainly drawn it now."
4,Bueno!,Cumple la funcion.. es un buen disco duro.. me gusto.. ya hasta lo vendi.. el vendedor muyyy bueno!! Saludos desde venezuela!
3,Looked fine but was the wrong hard drive,"My order was filled very quickly, arriving promptly at my doorstep. Unfortunately the listing for this device on Amazon was misleading. My search for a new hard drive for my laptop yielded this product, a hard drive for a desktop computer, which when it arrived looked just fine and in great condition. My return request, when processed through Amazon, was likewise handled in a prompt and professional manner."
1,Very Unhappy,"Purchased item and received in good time, however the hard drive was junk- doesn't power up, tested and turns out to be bad. attempted contact with covenant multiple times without resolve. very unhappy."
2,A Cheap Drive,"The Western Digital 40 GB HD (WD400BB) is slow and a bit noisy, and a big difference from Maxtor 40 GB (MX6L040J2).I wrote 950MB file ( 2061 file, 181 folder) to both of them.Here is the data:Western Digital took 9 min 2 sec.Maxtor took 1 min and 41 sec.Your surely can tell the difference from the data. Writting to WD400BB (EIDE)is even slower than writing to my USB hard drive.I might just get a no-good one. Beware, you guys"
2,Crashed without warning,Crashed yesterday (2yr 4months) in my wife's machine. No sign of failure or file corruption before the crash. Just dead in the morning and I tried to hook up to another pc as a slave drive and hope I can retrieve data but no help. Warranty is only one year so WD is not gonna take it back. I will now pay a little more and go for Seagate because of their good reputation.
4,Mine is Fine,"I got it with my Dell computer when I purchased in 2000, it did have to be replaced in 2002 but the new one has been running fine, I did have to get a new one to use it as a back up. Two draw backs are the size because the new software takes up so much space and also if you buy this one, the software cd is not included and you have to downloaded it from Western Digital. If your computer can handle bigger drives defintely go for it, if not this not a bad option especially for extra space."
2,Mine Crashed,"Mine is less than two years old. Will not boot, unable to recover data, it just clicks. I was going to buy another one until I read the feedback on this product."
3,Hmmmmm,"Ok, the other reviewers before me have done a great job of talking about the background of this band and the trajedy that befell them. Therefore I will skip to my review of what I feel is a lackluster album (it appears I'm in the minority, which is nice... I love Bad Astronaut). Anyway, there are no real great songs on here, just a bunch of good ones. For any other band that would be more than satisfying, but this is Bad Astronaut! Their first two albums are without a doubt two of my favorite records of all time. The band grew so much between Acrophobe and Houston... and I was hoping that 12 Steps would be even better than the first two. However, this is not the case. Ignoring the death of one of the key members of the band is unfair, but we are reviewing the cd here and I can't change my rating of the music. Hopefully over time this album will grow on me, but unlike the first two it has not hit me immediately."
4,Excellent but with some errors,"This Book is an excellent book for reference but as others mentioned there are several mistakes and so I think that while an excellent book one which ALOT of care and research obviously went into I have to say it could still use some revisions but if you are looking for a general reference and source for further reading and just about anything else I heartily reccommend this book though I believe they shoudl releasea second revised edition so the typos and such do not ruin the quality of such a massive, well done, informative and beautiful work I believe that it has truly earned its name and should be in the library of any interested in magick new age anthropology cryptography or a million other things"
4,A good reference if used with care,"While this book lacks real depth in any of its topics, it is quite useful as a starting point for general information. Unfortunately, the editor seems to have been asleep at his desk. There are numerous errors throughout the work, but nothing which a little time and determination won't see you around. A book worth having so long as you keep sight of its shortcomings."
3,Good but NOT great,"As a general reference, this book is a handy tool for the beginner or intermediate user. A couple of glaring oversights and errors have made it impossible for me to recommend this volume as a fully reliable resource. For instance, the Greek alphabet table is missing a letter, and one of the diagrams is incorrect. Those are the only two errors I've caught, and they are not major, but it renders the rest of the contents questionable, so that I feel the need to cross reference every entry. I still use the volume, but I don't entirely trust it. As the saying goes: ""How can you be trusted in the big things if you can't be trusted with the small ones?"" But the book can still serve as a convenient one-stop shop for very general inquiries. Just be sure to verify the information before applying it."
4,Excellent Reference and Symbol Source,"I loved this book because it is organized in such a neat way (numbers within systems) and because of the wealth of information it covers. The only disappointing thing is that it didn't go very deep into some of the systems I know I am interested in at least, such as runes or the ogham. However, it is undeniable that this is a necessary addition to the working magician's library, and shouldn't be missed!"
3,English willow basketry techniques,"This book has lots of great information on growing, preparing and using English willow to make baskets. The title suggests a more general topic. There are several example baskets with good instructions and diagrams, but if you're looking for instructions on flat- or round-reed baskets, look at Lyn Siler's books instead."
2,The clutch is DEFECTIVE ...,"After one return for a new drill and then trying several Drills at the Depot, and two calls to Dewalt, I finally got the answer to why the clutch DOES NOT WORK in low gear - the drill is DEFECTIVE. The Dewalt tech put it this way: ""We designed it to work in all speeds, but that's just the way it came out."" In other words, the production model is defective. I have an old 2-speed 18V drill, and the clutch works as it should in the 0-450 rpm range. The XRP clutch does not work in the 0-450 range. Since low speed has the highest torque, this is where you most need a clutch!! Wait for Dewalt to fix this! They know it is defective, but are trying to tell everyone it is normal. Bad show."
5,Best drill I have owned!,"I bought this drill about 2 weeks ago and I am still amazed by it. I am in a profession where I use it every day. I have been through 4 drills now, including 2 Makitas, 1 Craftsman and a DeWalt. I have to say that this one takes the cake for features. It has held up well over these past 2 weeks let see what it will do in the future. The batteries last a good 3 days after continues use. If I had to recomend a 12v drill to some one it would be this one."
4,"Nice, aside from clutch anomaly",Nice drill. Great torque. My only complaint is the same asthat by another reviewer -- the clutch doesn't function in thelowest gear (speed). Clearly this seems to be a flaw. Minusone star for that.
5,EXCELLENT,"This is hours of fun and quite a challenge! It's a great feeling when you configure one of the shapes in the booklet. It's great for abstract thinkers ... and for those left-brainers who want to exercise their right brain! There are so many different puzzles, you can play with it endlessly. The kids love it too, although it's pretty difficult. I think you should buy two and have contests - who can figure out the puzzle in less time. I love it! The only problem is that the shapes are different colors. A better version of this puzzle/game has all black shapes."
5,Truly Magnificant Love Story,"Cat Cochran and Travis Danvers meet when he recues her and her photographic equipment froom the tide coming in. They strike up a relationship and Cat tells Travis she cannot have children and explains the horrors of her first marriage. Travis has been hurt badly by his first marriage and really doesn't trust women. Cat is trying desperately to hold on, work and pay her many bills at which time her mother will remarry and the situation will improve.Well, Cat get pregnant, Simon accuses her of devious reasons for her telling him she could not pregnant. They quarrel and Simon leaves. Cat threatens miscarriage and the story proceeds. I won't say anymore but this is one of the most memorable books I have ever read and wish Ms Lowell would write more this type story.You will laugh, cry, feel terrible and then feel wonderful."
2,A mediocre offering and an alarming trend,"In the continuing trend of Ms. Lowell's to re-write her first books, re-package them (making them look like new works), and charge outragous amounts in the interest of cashing in on her popularity comes ""To the Ends of the Earth."" It is an unfortunate thing to have a beautiful book like ""The Danvers Touch"" turned into something so, well, boring. The original book, published over 15 years ago, stands as a testament to this authors power as a romance writer. There have been ups and downs over the years but as of late the downs have been more consistent than the ups. My advice to readers is to avoid this book and send a message to publishers and authors alike to stop exploiting us. If you can, try to get the original book that ""To the Ends of the Earth"" is based on."
4,Good Read!,"This book was an excellent example of Lowell at her best. The characters are intelligent and realistic. The only problem I have with re-writes... the language gets worse and frankly takes away from the plot and causes some confusion. I don't often cry while reading, but this one had me sobbing in the end, waiting for that happy ending but it did keep the pages turning. . I was happier with this book than I have been with works by Lowell. This was a good read!"
5,It has everything!,"This book has everything you would want in a romantic tale! Romance, passion, betrayal, loss, intrigue, tears, wonder, and hope. All I can really say is this is a wonderful story of LOVE between two very likeable characters. Highly recommended for romance readers!"
