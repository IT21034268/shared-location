5,A unique use for this product.,"To be fair, I did use it on my car and my wife's car and it concealed the scratches very well.What I bought it for was to eliminate the scratches on the surface of a BAM carbon fiber violin case, which has a clear coat very similar to that of automobiles. While most of us love using these cases because of their small size and very light weight, their surfaces are very prone to getting scratched up.Scratch X 2.0 is like a miracle substance, and it gets all of the ugly marks off of the case!!"
2,Haven't try yet,"I got this product 3days ago, but not try it yet. But here is a problem. When I got, I found it was opened and the produck was leaking. just like white toothpaste, the whole package was covered by this stuff, and only half of it left. I am not sure whose fault it's."
4,Meguiar's Scratch X 2.0,"Meguiar's Scratch X 2.0 helps to improve the color of the car deffekte incurred during the operation.Smoothes the paint removes dirt, scratches and minor defects."
2,Only conceals it..,"You put this product on and the scratches disappear fairly well, but when you wash your car or get a good rain, the scratches are back. It only conceals the scratches for a short time. I first applied it and i thought it had worked bc the scratches were mostly gone, but after a hard rain last night, i get up to see all my scratches back ugh."
1,doesn't work,Bought this item with hopes of taking out some scratches on my charger but that is not the case. Maybe I needed a tool to buff out the scratches and if that is the case they should state that in the description.
3,not for larger scratches,"Good product for smaller scratches, but for larger, which after all might require repainting it is evidently not appropriate."
1,not much luck with this,"Saw all the wonderful reviews and tried this on a tea green Honda CRV. After much huffing, puffing & buffing, over several days I saw very little/no improvement on even very minor scratches - think of the kind you see near the door handles (likely from finger nails). I also tried microfiber cloths as recommended. If it can't take these surface scratches out, I don't see how it can remove scratches from keyed cars as some customers suggest. Based on my experience, I advise against wasting your money, energy and time on this."
2,Not working on mine,"Tried this and the result is zero, even the scratch is minor (can't feel it with finger tip)."
2,Didn't work,This product didn't get the scratch out. Maybe it would have gotten a really superficial scratch out. It wasn't worth buying.
2,I tried to get results,"I wanted this to work like others before it. I follow the written directions and get no results. seems to help with the faintest of scratches but other than that, no help. I tried a few times and got very little results. I will try with a friend who does detailing and try for other results.Maybe my expectations were too high, like the latest summer sequel to an old franchise. Go in expecting small results. Will update if I see anything new happen with my next and maybe last try.Car: 2003 BMW M3Small scrapes on door from get open door knick and finger nail scratches at door handle.Considering pictures. If I do that means this worked or tried other product and sharing results."
2,SCRATCH X won't remove bird dropping stains,"I have a brand new 2008 G37S that already has a bird dropping stain. The stain happened at night and I cleaned the dropping within a few hours. The dropping etched the clear coat, so I tried SCRATCH X to remove it. It might have slightly reduced the stain after two applications. I was seeing some fine scratches where I applied it, so I decided to stop. I can't recommend this product for removing bird dropping stains.I hate birds."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have a black car with some minor scratches I wanted to cover on the hood of my car. I went to a car care store and specifically asked for something that will work on a black car. I even showed the guy the type of scratches I wanted to get rid of. He said this product would work. It didn't. I washed my car first, then dried it, then put this stuff on and buff as the instructions state. All it did was leave a film on my newly washed car! I threw it in the trash and will never fall for this kind of junk again."
1,Not worth the money,"Actually, I didn't even pay for it. It was issued to me. Hardly used it because of it's odd shape and the lens broke already--rendering the flashlight inoperable.I guess Pelican was thinking you could set this light down and shine it up at your subject. Fine if you like 8000 candlepower glaring in your eyes while you try to work.Biggest con--it's plastic. Plastic breaks, just like mine did. I'm not even real sure what happened. I think one of my kids over-tightened the lens (which is also the on/off mechanism.)If you're like me, when you need light, you NEED light. This one can't be counted on. Buy a Mini-Maglite. Mine still works after almost 20 years."
3,5C,"Abel's Island was a good book! I got bored through some of it, but other parts were exciting. It had good word choice. There were some pretty big words, but I could understand them, since they were in good sentences.Abel's Island is about a mouse who gets stuck on an island. He is blown out of the cave while trying to get his lovely wife's scarf. He has several attampts to get off the island, but no such luck until the water shallows down and he swims across."
5,A good book for people who like fairy tale type books,A mouse named Abel is out in a windy storm and gets blown off to a strange island. Will he ever get back???
3,Okay,"This book is a classic, sweet story about a clever mouse named Abel. One day, he and his beautiful wife Amanda go into the woods foe a picnic. But then, a hurricane comes along and sweeps Abel far away to a inhabited island. Abel learns how to survive on the island, but at the same time, he also tries to find a way to get home. In the end, he returns home, and finds Amanda there waiting for him.Even though this book was well written, and had a happy ending, I found it to be dull. The story moved too slowly and the plot was all together too predictable. Therefore, I would not recommend this book to tweens."
2,Did not engage my 10-year-old,"This was required reading for my son going into fifth grade. He is not a strong reader, and neither he nor I enjoyed it. The combination of a large amount of flowery language and very little action made it a struggle to get through. What little humor there was, was too sophisticated. It was hard for us to identify with this foppish married mouse who ate caviar and champagne. While I can appreciate that many (I guess most!) find it literary and delicious, my son found it boring, and looking at it through his eyes, I have to agree."
1,... A waste of time,"I was forced to read Abel's Island for a school assingment. It was about this mouse on and island. Very boring.... It was miserable to have to read this, so do not waste your time reading it!!"
5,A real classic,"This is one of those books that you never forget, and keep coming back to as an adult. William Steig's sense of humor and use of the language are great for kids and invite participation from parents. If you're tired of books that are written down for kids, try out Steig. Zeke Pippin is another of our favorites."
3,Limited Compatibility,"I assumed that this rip fence would be compatible with my recently purchased DeWalt DCS393 cordless circular saw (part of a DeWalt DCK590L2 5-tool combo kit). It was NOT. The correct part number turned out to be Part No. 381091-00, which I had a devil of a time finding. Unless you have one of the specifically listed DeWalt circular saws, I would definitely NOT recommend buying this product. You may be letting yourself in for a lot of headaches and unnecessary shipping charges."
5,DeWalt circular saw rip fence,This product is a musthave for any user of a circular saw. It is essential in making accurate cuts when ripping wood into narrower pieces.
1,Will not fit the DeWalt cordless circular saw,"The product description states that it will fit ""most"" DeWalt cicular saws when it should state that it will fit ""some"" circular saws. Bad enough that DeWalt leaves out the rip fence from its 18v cordless circular saws. Got the short end of the stick twice with my DeWalt saw purchase first from DeWalt and then by Amazon.If you enter the DeWalt DC390 model number for the cordless circular saw Amazon returns this DW3278 which will not work with the DC390 saws. Not listed if you search on Amazon but actually sold and stocked by Amazon is the OEM Replacement Part #381091-00 rip fence which is the correct one for use with the DeWalt cordless circular saw.Amazon needs to fix their listing but accuracy is not a priority or even a concern for their product management people."
2,Not terribly useful,"I purchased this with the intent of using it to rip 2x lumber. First, for many pieces of lumber, the base plate of the saw is too wide to make this attachment useful. For other sheets of wood, it doesn't extend far enough. 90% of the time, I end up building a fence out of clamps and pieces of 2x that are lying around and that works just fine, if not better than this."
1,Do not buy for DEWALT DCS391L1,looks great just doesn't fit the DEWALT DCS391L1. The way the guide is packaged makes it impossible to return so look for mine on ebay...
5,Misinformation,"I purchased this rip fence to go with a saw I was given at Christmas. All information I was able to obtain stated that it would fit all Dewalt circular saws, WRONG, luck would have it that I also own another Dewalt saw that it does fit, so the purchase was not in vain. I am still looking for a rip fence to go with my new Dewalt DC390."
4,"simple design, easy to use","Nice design,my opinion only,could be a bit thicker,wish it were longer.Didn't know what to expect,can only use 4 inches of extension,but still,great tool."
4,Beatles Magical Mystery Tour Memories,"For most casual fans, probably better that you just rent this DVD from Netflix or somewhere else rather than purchase it. However, if you are a diehard Beatles fan then you will want to purchase this DVD. It is an interesting behind the scenes look at the filming of this movie, which has some truly unforgettable scenes mixed in with some forgettable bits. The interviews are all interesting and give a true feel for the fairly haphazard (60's?) approach to filming this movie. I personally think that, with some different editing, this movie could be a really good, true ""classic"". It was a precursor in many ways to Monty Python, and some bits in the movie are just funnier and weider than hell in that wonderful, crazy 60's way. So for me purchasing this DVD was worth it just to get more of an idea of how the whole thing was created."
3,More of an apology book,"When I purchased this book, I though I was getting a book that explained how to write letters in response to people who are genuinely rude, misguided or worse. I thought it would be a written version of how to handle seriously annoying people. This book is more like advice on how to handle sticky situations you may have gotten yourself into. The advice is very ethical and honest, and explains how to write a response to someone you may have upset in such a way that it will end any possible conflict. I think the book is pretty good in that regard, and it gives several nice examples. It just tells you how to deal with yourself when you are being difficult - not how to deal with someone else who is difficult."
1,Demons of Stony River,"It's clear that Tom Willard has plagiarized the book ""Monarch of Dead Mans Bay"" !A poor attempt to become a writer. I found this book lacking original thought and creativity.It's clear Mr. Willard has no concepts of his subject in this book. This book reflects he lacks the skills of a true outdoors man or a writer.I have nothing good to recommend about this book, it's a waste of time and money."
5,The Seedy Underbelly of the 1950's Perfect Family Revealed,"This was the 1950's American Beauty. Need I say more? The ""Father Knows Best"" / ""Leave it to Beaver"" 1950's family is broken down by drug addiction...having grown up watching Leave it to Beaver reruns (amongst other things), the contrast was truly effective. Not a movie for the feint of heart."
3,an early look at drug addiction,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the filmBigger Than Life is a 1956 Nicholas Ray film about a family man who develops a disease that can only be treated by Hydrocortisone. He later becomes addicted which causes him to become violent and confrontational. The film was quite intense for its time but paved the ground for later films dealing with the subject. The film stars James Mason and Walter Matthau.The supplements include a theatrical trailer, Audio commentary by Geoff Andrew, interviews with Susan Ray, the director's widow, and author author Jonathan Lethem, and an archival interview with Nicholas Ray.This film is a must see and really strives for candidness."
5,Perfect Match,"Because Theroux knew Gorey personally, he wisely restricts himself to providing a colorful character portrait, rather than pointless theorizing on Gorey's art. This is a brief book, but, because of the author's lively style, and also certainly because of his unique artistic insight (Theroux and Gorey seem to be two of a kind), much deeper than a more straightforward dissertation might have been."
4,Tea with Gorey,"Theroux's short book delves into Gorey's persona and influences and gives us a tantalizing glimpse into the world of the much missed Edward Gorey. By limiting himself to his friendship with Gorey, Theroux preserves the air of mystery surrounding the writer and artist. This volume is a welcome addition to anyone's collection of Gorey books and collectibles."
2,"Gorey, through a filter",As a couple of other reviewers have stated this book is as much about the author as it is about the subject. We don't get Gorey's personality as much as we get Theroux's take on him. Gorey emerges not so much as an individual as a collection of tics and affectations...though to be fair that might be an accurate picture of the man. This doesn't claim to be a biography but a personal reminiscence and that's about it.
3,A very mixed blessing,"This is a peculiar book. It goes on at length about what EG liked and disliked, and tells us a lot about the author's likes and dislikes too. It's entertaining, but repetative - I like knowing that EG loved Buffy The Vampire Slayer, like me, but didn't need telling four times. I suppose that, Gorey having been a non-travelling, non-marrying recluse, there's not much material to draw on. Theroux spins out what he has into a book that, I suppose, every Gorey fan has to read, there being little else of a biographical nature. Expect to get that warm feeling you get from realising that one of your heroes likes the same stuff as you, but not a lot of other feelings. Was Gorey gay? Theroux bangs on about this a fair amount. He also goes to great lengths comparing him to the likes of Auden and Henry James, for some reason. I learned things, I think I know Gorey a bit better, so the book did a job, I suppose."
5,Quaint and Dainty and Charming,"These are just beautiful little fairy stickers. I bought them for myself because I love everything fairy but my 5 year old insisted I share them with her of course, and we've been having a blast with them! They sure are lovely and make everything we stick them on that much fancier!"
4,Good step workout...,"Lynne Brick leads you through this 30 minute step routine, she instructs one on one, but is friendly, enthusiastic and cues well. The choreography is pretty easy to pick up, you will see basic steps, v-steps, knee lifts, step kicks, over the tops, straddles, etc. She teaches one combination at a time and at the end of the workout you will do all of them one last time. She also gives options to increase the intensity should it become to easy, as well as options for keeping it at lower intensity.This video is from the early 90's, so the music is dated, but it's not too bad. The set is the same as most of the Buns of Steel series, which is plain but never bothered me. Lynne seems to be enjoying herself throughout the workout, which makes it more fun for me. I always get quite a workout from this routine, which is best for beginner/intermediate levels, advanced will most likely find this way too easy."
1,Tape doesn't work,"I ordered this video tape because the same one I already have, which I ordered a couple of years ago, didn't work when I received it. This video tape does the same thing. The picture blacks out and comes back on all throughout the video. I know it's not my VCR, because all my other video tapes work. I love this workout, but it is hard to workout when the picture isn't on half the time. Seems like the whole bunch of them are broken."
5,Love these pants!,"I bought a pair of capri-length wrap pants while on a recent vacation, and love them so much I decided I needed another pair. These wrap pants are perfect for yoga because they move how you do without bunching, but are also great for just lounging around. The lavender and pink colors are very pretty, and I like the fact that these are ankle-length. I also bought the tan pair as a gift. If you've never worn them, be aware that they are supposed to be VERY large around the waist prior to tieing them, a ""one-size-fits-all"" item."
2,Defective title! Humboldt writing his own biography decades after his death?.,"No author's name is supplied by seller! The biography is about Humboldt, but we are not told who wrote it! Grade: F-"
5,Calling All Single Women-- BUY THIS BOOK,"Believe it or not, you'll still love this book. I have given it to all of my single friends over age 30. Along with her bewitchery, Dolnick doles out pragmatic advice for the lovelorn. IT'S A PERFECT VALENTINES DAY PICK ME UP FOR A SINGLETON."
3,A directory that was very informative in aiding focus to luv,"I appreciatied the simplicity in guidience that directed my focus so that I might achieve my desires and feel that I am playing an active part in my lifes desires. I felt that the counsel before the catagories of spells was well needed, and most informative. The author seemed to really understand these events, situations,and thoughts, that lead to the need of such effiecient material. Thank you, April Corvin-Ahmed"
4,it works,"i just got my copy and did a glamour spell that worked like a charm, im really new to the occult world.the book works and thats the most important thing the author also brakes down this that will help you in general.Alot of the steps are extremly helpfull."
2,not very helpful,"this book did not offer a lot of really good spells.most of these spells were all for the same thing.and most of them were also for two people who are already together.i was looking for a book that offered many different types of love spells for different purposes, so i was kind of disappointed with this book."
4,True Love,If you are meant to be with the one you love this book will help you accomplish it. If you follow the authors directions to the letter you can not fail. Her instructions are simple just like the title. I found this book very helpful and full of valuable information that any begginer or expert could use.
2,Disappointing Follow Up to Volume 1,"If you got Dance Essentials, volume 1 and expected the second rendition to rival it, you will be sorely disappointed. This CD lacks the energy and constant ""up"" of volume 1. I have listened to volume 1 over and over and over ad nauseum, and STILL, I smile every time I hear it. I found myself jumping ahead to the next song on volume 2 due to the monotonous rhythm and lack of interesting vocals or accompaniment. What a disappointment. I will surely not RUSH to get volume 3.Too bummed ..."
4,An interesting find,"I noticed this book by chance on a library shelf while searching specifically for something else; it looked interesting, so I got it out as well. Pretty comprehensive look at post-independence Eritrea at a grasp-able level, including photos. Would make a great book to take along while traveling, etc."
3,a fun if perplexing rhythm/mix toy,"Yes, its a toy but a fun one. I thought the controls were easy to jump into and just starting playing, but if you scratch the surface there is a lot to obsess over and tweak. No, its not Pro Tools but limitations are the stuff of true inspiration. When you get bored with the built-in patches upload your own and you can fart around endlessly... kinda dated DJ culture interface but almost comical at this point."
1,game sucks,"I chose this rating because the game is literally worthless. I am a musician and all i wanted to do was make a drum pattern for a song i already wrote, there is only 4 beats you can ""mix"" together, and they are all crap as well. totally disatisfied."
4,TraxxPad was a good Game,This game was great when it came out i played it almost everyday my friends loved to rap over my beats i created. wish you could save them to the computer though.
2,Not much fun.,"I'll keep it short. This game is not much fun. Not entertaining, not exciting, doesn't really simulate a music instrument or beat pad. I have only tried it 4 or 5 times, but it's not pick up and ""create"" play so don't expect that. I was hoping it would be like ""MTV Music Creator"" on the Playstation 1 and 2, but no such luck.Try these games for more entertainment on your PSP: DJ Max Portable (soone to be released in the USA, but available now on import sites from Asia.)"
3,good but lacks to much,"I love this thing and no I'm not hating or anything. The traxx pad is great but if your looking for something that allows you to go all out and make something heave in detail and what not. Then don't get this I love music and all but when I get an idea for a beat, tone, song the traxxpad always lets me down. I love eastern music and underground and this contains everything a western or experienced mainstream lover would want. But for some one that makes crazy beats its a headache. do note that you can recored your own sounds and what not but need a microphone psp sound recording cam. and instruments."
2,BOOOOOOO!,This game sucks...you can't play it very good...unless you THOUROUGHLY read the manual. I would reccomend NOT buying this game.
3,very good cam...for the price,"This cam can't be beat for $20. I previously tried the Logitech Procam 4000 for $80 and I honestly believe it wasn't much better than the GE. Its biggest weakness is its poor light sensitivity under artificial light. I needed a bright lamp overhead to make my face presentable on cam at night. Daylight was no problem. On the plus side, software is quick and easy to use, cam is compatible with internet messenging and the base is stable and doesn't dislodge annoyingly as the Logitech's did. If your web cam needs are personal, I see no reason to pay more. Its frame speed was, to my unexpected pleasure, equal to the Logitech's. Professionals needing sophisticated web conferencing hardware might want to splurge for better equipped cam, though."
3,Driver Download,here is the website for all you people who lose those CD's like me.... http://www.jascoproducts.com/cgi-local/SoftCa rt.exe/online-store/scstore/2003_pccams_drive r.html?E+scstore might be a small pain in the neck to download but once you do... you'll be happy again! have a nice day!
2,No drivers available,"I've bought this camera and i am not satisfied with it at all. I got roped in by the low price, that's how i came aorund to buying this stupid thing. I cannot get it to work in Windows XP, neither in XPHome nor in XPPro. I searched and searched and searched.. i could not find any drivers at all for this thing. Target should recommend this camera for users not using WInXP. GE's site does not help either... they have no page for computer peripherals. I checked sites like windriver.com, i even check microsoft's download page... NOTHING. Don't buy this camera... you'd be better off with a more expensive and popular brand like logitech or creative labs... GE just doesn't cut it. If anyone does find a driver for both versions of WINXP, could you please list it here.. so that others won't have to go through what this stupid camera put me through..."
3,Where are the drivers?,"It worked for a while, but I no longer have the software and I can't find it on the internet."
3,Help Please,"I have one of these GE EasyCam's.. And it works great.. I recently reformatted my hard drive, and the software is no longer on my computer.. I really need the software.. if anyone could send it to me.. at cutieinwy@hotmail.com, it would be much appreciated"
4,A Nice Ring,"I chose this one because I needed something indestructable for work. Also, it looked good on the screen.When I received it, I pleasantly surprised about how nice it looked. I really like it."
5,Lovely!,"I was looking for a nice wedding band to wear when I go camping, biking, etc. so my diamond ring doesn't get damanged. I found this lovely ring and ordered it. My husband liked it so much that he ordered a matching one, too. The quality is excellent and the rings are very pretty. They also fit really well - I've never had a comfort fit ring before and it really *is* very comfortable. The order arrived much faster than anticipated. I'll definitely buy from this seller again."
1,ZERO STARS,"I bought this with high hopes of a quick teeth whitener. I did have low expectations because it does seem a little to good to be true, and when something seems to good to be true it normally is. I used this product about 6 times I used one full tube of the whitener, and my results were absolutely nothing but a gross gel in my mouth. The light also doesnt go out after 10 min, I also left it in more then 10 min the first time I have no idea since the light didnt turn off maybe like 35 minutes and all the rest of the times at least 15 minutes. Rusults, nothing...good luck if you buy this product and I hope it works for you because it didnt work for me. :(-Two thumbs down."
1,Not as promised,"I bought this after seeing it on TV and was disappointed. It made a slight difference but nothing compared to what I hoped (even considering I didn't have high expectations). I followed each step as the directions implied and nothing. I have an additional kit and I am not even going to bother with it. Very disappointed overall, but I do think that some at home kits really do work. I will try another and post my results."
4,Great insight,This is another great book for insight into the life and times of black sailors of the 40's. No one account of stories tell all but a collection of different encounters give you a great idea of their experiences.
4,A Debut,"Natalia is a daughter of my beloved singer Anna Jantar. So when her record came out I had certain expectations, yes to some extent I am biased. But I can certainly say with clear conscience that this is a very good record, and was a great start. Every single song is different, so the record is colorful and could carry a surprise or two with each song. Very original sound of ""Nazywanie"" (Naming), to very reflective ""Dlon"" (A Hand)that is respectively regarding her thoughts and memories of her mom. Kamila Iwanowska"
3,Too large for everyday wear,"Attractive watch, and I like the fact that it lights up. Unfortunately it is just a little too large for my taste in an everyday watch. Makes it seem somewhat 'over the top' with its bright gold bezel & mother of pearl face. The light function also makes it thick, so it sticks out from your wrist. Not a good choice if you want something subdued/non-clunky, especially if you have a small wrist.MEMO TO AMAZON: PLEASE post measurements (diameter/thickness) of all the watches you sell! This would help your customers who are looking for a certain size watch, & would undoubtedly cut down on returns."
3,works fine but not impressive,"it has big numbers ,easy to read for a short sighted person. It works well and it arrived on time, but its a dull ,not impressive watch. It looks nicer on the web."
2,"Good Watch, Bad Exchange Policy","I received this watch as a birthday gift. The watch is very nice with a great band; however, I thought the face of the watch was a little bigger than I wanted, so I contacted the company to make an exchange. They would not exchange the product. The only thing they could do was have me return the item, charge a $10.00 fee, and then credit the person who originally purchased the watch."
4,Perfect Slices,My wife decorates cakes on the side and I thought this would be perfect for her and for when we have parties. It does what it is supposed to. The only complaint is that it is hard to cut through fondant.
5,worth the price,"I bought this for one project, arrived quick, worked as advertised and will work for many more years. now if we could just get dewalt to manufacture in the USA again and amazon to specify where things were made it would make getting products even easier."
4,Great Guide,"A good book to introduce one to the Baltics, even though it is dated. Photographs and illustrations are especially good. Only problem is that it's heavy to carry around. Well worth the price!"
2,terrible yoyo,This yoyo is the worst yoyo ever! It's sleep time is about 7 seconds which means you can barely do anything with it! Overall this yoyo is the worst yoyo I have ever recieved.
4,Nice holder and pen; stupid eraser,"I feel silly reviewing this, but I figured why not.The pen and marker holder works great on my refrigerator so roomies can leave messages to each other, but the ""eraser"" on the end of the marker is kind of silly. It easily comes off of the marker and doesn't work very well. A paper towel and water or a magic erase marker make it much easier. Would I suggest it? Sure. The holder keeps the marker in place so we constantly aren't searching, and the thin tip of the marker makes it easier to right legibly :)"
4,Modern Physics,"This book was appropriately priced for the condition it was in (fair to good.) The shipping took a little longer than I had expected, but by all accounts the transaction was smooth and equitable. I would gladly do business with the seller again.-B."
4,Eddy's review,"This album is a must have if you like rock! It is something different than the every day, played out tunes. Its not exactly mainstream music, but why aren't these guys famous yet? Insomnia is a slow rocker that can only be described as beautiful. Almost all of these songs I like. If your lookin for something different, this is it. Hard rock at its best.......check it out."
5,poodlepurse,My 2 yr old granddaughter loves this purse. It's so soft and it was bigger than i thought it would be so that is a plus
3,Almost as good...,"...as the 17-month Plan-it Plus wall calendar. While this is a GREAT planner, it lacks the wonderful detail of having individual lines for each family member. So, you're back to cramming everything into that little ""day box"" for each person.Other than that, it's okay to use and I've got mine filled already!"
1,Disturbing,"I thought this book had some good ideas and thoughts in the beginning of the book. However, as I read on, I became more disgusted. He tragically takes apart religion. Religion is needed even in todays day and age. I wouldn't even let my dog read this junk.He tells you to go and rip apart your parents. I am sorry, some people could not handle that. If I were to approach my mother with such disrespect, I would EXPECT the doorto be slammed in my face, and justifiably so. People that follow his ideas, really need to think about the way that they would want to be treated. If you did your best, would you want your child coming back to you telling you about all the things you did wrong? We work with what we are given in the world. I threw the book out. What a waste."
2,"Works, but cheapo w/ dodgy software","Cable works fine with official Nokia PC Suite software.This vendor shipped the cable with a suspicious, unlabeled DVD-R of software installers of unknown provenance. Turned this disk into coaster, used Nokia suite instead."
5,Compatible both Mac and Windows,I bought 80 GB portable hard drive just two days ago and I m in love with it. Those customers who say that it doesn't work with Mac need to review the FAQ on SimpleTech website. The solution is you'd have to go to Disk Utility and after choosing the hard drive (portable) you will have to Erase...Then you are on the fly...it'll work for both.
1,Dell Laptop couldn't recognize device.,I was eager to receive it and start using though I found out that the Dell Latitude Laptop Win XP at first couldn't recognize it.Support asked me to update Chipset Driver and then disconnect and connect the Hard Drive again. Then it was recognized and Started working. Also found that for Laptop it takes 2 usb ports to connect wire 1 for power and 1 for deive. Little slow writing speed.
1,Only thing it's Good for is Headaches,"Don't walk away from this product, run. I have owned it for less than a week and it has caused me nothing but headaches. Of course, if you like messages like ""In Page Error"" or much worse, ""Windows was unable to save data to file... Data has been lost. This may be due to a hardware or network connection problem"" then go ahead and buy it, but otherwise find a different solution. FWIW, this is the second SimpleTech storage device that I've owned. Neither of them are in working condition."
1,this is the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!1,were is the beandip the salsa thee well u get it its a taco but its not OK
5,Why don't we know these stories?,I started to hear about these surveillance flights about a year ago. The information in this book is fascinating.Worth the read!
2,Not what it purports to be...of interest to USAFSS personel only,"Downloaded after reading the well written sample (that dealt with the post ""cold-war"" incident with China in 2001). The first 30% of the book covered other (but by no means ALL) cold war shootdowns but provided no more information than that freely available on the web. After that it became a recitation of crew manifests, and training histories of the USAF Security Service. My guess is that a lot of USAFSS missions that might have involved ""near-miss"" sorties will remain classified for the foreseeable future. If you served in USAFSS you might recognize some folks or hijinks mentioned here, for the rest of us it's a big yawn."
4,Fascinating stuff on aerial intelligence gathering,"Like most people I've heard about Gary Powers and the shooting down of his U-2 spy plane but until the recent incident in China I didn't know much about our other intelligence gathering missions. This book changed all that. They were doing this stuff all the way back to the Second World War on bombing raids over Japan using Nisei operators. Very interesting stuff.If you like the really technical side of military aviation then this is the book for you. But if you're more like me and like the human side of things, this is also the book for you. Both the authors actually flew these missions so they not only know what it was like, they tell you exactly what it felt like. The main story about the shooting down of flight 60528 is just heart wrenching. What really surprised me though is just how many of our planes have been attacked over the years. The research in this book is great."
1,JUNK!!,"Stay away from this product. Like others who have had similar experiences...the mouse and keyboard worked fine for awhile and then just died. I also thought it was the batteries or the signal. But no matter what I did, nothing helped. Tried to go online to find support. Forget it. You might as well just trash both items ... from now on I will buy only quality goods when it comes to computers. When you buy cheap products, you get what you pay for."
2,MIstake,"Mouse won't work after 1 month, function keys activate ???/ randon strokes. Feel is good, seems functional enough... But I cant' even find anywhere for help to investigate prblems!"
1,JUNK mouse OK keyboard,"I have had this keyboard/mouse combo for about three months. I always had trouble with the mouse. I thought it was the batteries, or the positioning from the receiver, or my mouse pad was too smooth to make the ball roll all of the time.WRONG! I finally figured out the problem. The ball in the mouse is too small for the hole is rests in. When I move the mouse up or down or right -- no problem. But when I move the mouse to the left it doesn't work. Well the roller inside the mouse is on the left side of the ball. The hole is so big that the ball, when pushed left, pulls away from the roller. The result is no mouse movement. What junk!I just hope I can still get a refund. I will no longer nurse this mouse along. I will replace it ASAP. Do not waste your time or money on this trash. Learn from my mistake.The keyboard is pretty good -- not great. But what good is a wireless keyboard/mouse combo when one of the components is absolutely worthless?"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have had so much trouble getting this thing to work. The keyboard has worked fine, but I haven't programmed the quick buttons yet. The mouse will not work at all. I am going to attempt to return this thing. It was a Christmas gift and the person that gave it to me cannot find the receipt. He just assumed that this was going to be a good product and was not worried about it! Guess we were both wrong about that!"
2,GE Wireless Keyboard and Mouse,"I decided to buy this wireless keyboard and mouse about six months ago. I picked it because it didn't look too bad, had some nice features, and was inexpensive. Like many others who have written reviews about this set, I quickly realized why it was so inexpensive. The keyboard works well, but the mouse is a disaster. It doesn't move smoothly and sometimes doesn't move much at all. I have tried cleaning it, replacing batteries, and moving the receiver closer to it but nothing has improved its performance. I guess I sort of got what I paid for. It's a good keyboard/mouse set if you're really short on money and need something right away, but if you're getting it for long term use, I would reccomend spending more money to get something that is a little better quality."
1,This series of books are a ripoff,These crooks just put together speeches and stuff - no law except maybe a useless constitution.
1,Very weak effort,"This book is a very poor effort. It regurgitates officials speeches and statistics with very little actual law provided. What law is provided is very broad and indicative guidance to local business. It includes very little which is of relevance to the Territory's offshore finance industry. The only good thing going for it is the price. For a much more detailed look at business law in the BVI, I'd suggest the more comprehensive (albeit much more expensive) ""British Virgin Islands Commercial Law"" published by Sweet & Maxwell."
1,Caveat emptor,"Read the review in the Spring 2000 issue of The Shakespeare Newsletter before purchasing this book. The review begins, ""Briefly, this is so dreadfully bad a book that it, quite literally, ought to be withdrawn from publication"" (18); the review amply substantiates this judgment in several thousand words quoting and describing the egregious errors in this book."
1,One Star is Generous,"This book is so bad, Amazon needs to come up with a NO STAR option. There are a stunning number of factual errors. Literally dozens, maybe into three digits. The author's grasp of the material is always superficial. I can't imagine a worse book on this subject. I know this sounds like hyperbole. It is not."
4,Added 5 MPG,"Love this chip. Took ~ 15 minutes to install (instructions were easy to follow). Truck has a lot more zip, oh and I'm getting 18 MPG mixed and 19+ MPG Highway!!"
3,"Excellent singer, CD is alright","I first heard of Kasia Kowalska in the '96 Eurovision Song Contest, representing Poland with a beautiful song. This album came as a disappointment; the songs are not really very good in my opinion (but that's a matter of taste). Most of them are rock ballads. It's a shame I don't like the songs, since her voice is really good, so if you're into this kind of music than this album might be worth checking out."
2,American or Korean,"Same comment -- the description should not say American because it is actually Korean. Also, it does not show capsule content weight."
1,Why does it show Korean Ginseng label now?,"I've ordered this before a few months ago, and I got American Ginseng as I wanted. (no problem) Well it's time for a re-fill. Why did the picture get updated to show Korean Ginseng? I only want American Ginseng. When I search for American Ginseng this product turns up but the photo is all wrong? Please fix your errors. I don't trust this and will have to order another brand for now to make sure I get American and not Korean Ginseng. (totally different effects/benefits)I'll update my 1 star to 5 once it's corrected."
4,Very Absorbing,This was a very good book. A neighbor gave me another book about the Astra family to read and that is what got me interesting in the other books of the series.
4,Damn good,"This is a very strong release. Musically, it's interesting and enjoyable as always but nothing terribly new compared to her previous stuff. But the lyrics are more bitingly honest than anything she's done before. It's the same tales of woe, laced with a bit of hope, but this time it really hits the mark.I still like her old stuff but she's grown up and this release, more than any other, shows that. This constant change is interesting enough for her music to have held my attention for the past 15+ years. It's nice that this release doesn't break that trend."
5,Very Good,This was an excellent effort from Juliaa Hatfield. As usual she delivers excellent guiter-driven rock. She deserves more success. One of the best songwriters for a decade.
2,"A total ""pop"" album","No doubt Juliana is in top form, musically, on this CD, however, if you are looking for something similar to her previous work, you'll be dissappointed. This is a pop album in every sense of the word. No grungy guitars. No growls or snarling vocals. Honestly, this CD falls in the same vein of Sarah McLaughlin and Jewel. Nothing exciting here. This is the album Atlantic records wanted Juliana to record 8 years ago when they were looking for her to be a pop princess. Today, these songs are unoriginal and lack any spark or emotion. Juliana is best when she's pissed off about something (see ""Beautfil Creature"" which is freakin brilliant!). Maybe she's just too happy right now, I don't know, but I found this CD to be a total bore. Give me angst-ridden Juliana anyday over this American Idol bubble gum pop. Her other work is MASTERFUL - this is really rather dull."
2,let down,"I got the album the day it came out. I was anticipating its release for quite a while. And, I was disappointed. You know when someone resorts to putting a recording of a dog barking in one of their songs...well, it was painful to listen to. The songs are just so boring and typical.And not what I expected at all.I'll just keep listening to Only Everything.That's the brilliant album.If you don't have any of her stuff, buy that one first.(An addendum: I read an interview with Juliana a couple years after this album was released, and she said it was made to please her record company...I just knew she wouldn't make those kind of songs if she weren't forced to.)"
3,Does not fit Mini Mag,"Advertised that it will fit a mini mag,it does NOT fit the Cannon mini mag downrigger that I have. I will have to file/sand down the downrigger base for this thing to fit."
2,Almost Worthless Dumbed Down Material,"There is very little in this book that is not obvious.Essentially the book is a list of don't. Don't make a product unless people are willing to buy it. Don't create a business without a real need. Products don't sell themselves, etc.Unfortunately the author gives little guidance on how to determine if your idea fits into any of his don't. Essentially you are not given the tools you need. If you get it wrong he can say ""Well you did not figure out what the customers wanted"". True but useless.There are a couple of things mentioned that may not be obvious to most readers. The impact of technical standards is one example.I doubt this book will help many people."
1,A book full of platitudes,"I ordered this book with great anticipation, more anticipation than it deserves: this book is full of useless platitudes like pick the right market; do your home work; zero in on customer needs. This tripe is the mantra of the business press, not the distilled wisdom of how to spot or identify extraordinary opportunities for new ventures.To me, this book looks at the traits that ""successful"" ventures seem to exhibit and then assumes that the success is due to the traits; it seems that the author is affirming the consequent without proving that the success is due more to the selected traits than to randomness. My question to the author is this: how many ventures within a given cohort failed yet had the very same traits that he says ""causes"" these survivors to be successful? Until we know the answer to that question, it seems to me that this book has little to offer in identifying any real opportunity,let alone extraordinary ones."
4,Good for the money!,"There are quite a few wireless mouse options on the market, but this package is all inclusive, even batteries! I haven't experienced any problems so far and it basically installed itself on my computer. I've seen some of the other, pricier versions on my friends computers and they seem to react a bit better, but the difference is negotiable."
2,Spend the extra money for a better wireless mouse,"The price of this mouse was great. However, it is a pain to use. This mouse uses small black touch sensitive buttons to sense when you have you hand on the mouse in order to get it out power saver mode so that it will start working. Problem is, where my fingers rest on the mouse is not where these touch sensitive buttons are. So you have to make sure you are touching these buttons before you start using the mouse.Also, I had some trouble positioning the receiver where it could receive the signal from the mouse."
1,Good for temporary use,"And by temporary, I mean a couple of days. This mouse while slick and sexy in styling leaves a lot to be desired on the functional side. The one given to me installed fine, but stopped working after a couple of days. Couldn't get it working again, so I guess this was my rebound mouse relationship and I have a choice to go back to my previous love or find another. To me price was high considering in only worked for a few hours spread out over 5 days (cost ~$10/hr, that's more than minimum wage). If you buy it, I hope it works for you, but I know I will steer clear of other GE branded items except NBC, I like that network."
2,Annoying,"The side buttons are hard to use, because it's hard to press on one of them without pressing another button at the same time.The mouse goes into power savings mode after 1 second of inactivity, giving a very slight but noticeable delay before the pointer will move. After 15 seconds, the delay is even longer and more noticeable and annoying, and after 1 hour, you have to click a button to wake the mouse up.The motion seems to be jittery occasionally, and it's hard to adjust the pointer to a satisfying speed and acceleration. It's either too fast or too slow.On the plus side, the scroll wheel is quiet and has a nice feel to it.Spend an extra 20 bucks and avoid the annoyances."
1,Crapioca pudding.,It explodes my batteries... making acid spill all over the desk. Stay away from this garbage! GE stick to making jet engines!
1,Worst computer mouse I've ever had the misfortune to lay hands on!,"Just terrible, after a few months the receiver started messing up, I had to plug it in and out for the connection light to turn on, eventually I had to wiggle the receiver to the sides and fiddle around with the connect buttons to get it to work. Ah and if that wasn't enough trouble, the scrolling wheel stopped working and got stuck, I can't even scroll with it. Just don't waste your precious money on this useless device, get a Logitech instead or a Microsoft mouse, my previous Logitech mouse lasted nearly 3 years and it broke because it was squashed by some stuff of mine. GE should just stick to making home appliances, seriously!I wish I could award it no stars"
2,The Squeaky Wheel,"Man this is an annoying product. The scroll wheel squeaks! How can a Every time I scroll down I have to hear squeak, squeak, squeak. $20 might seem like a good deal but it's not. You're just going to need to buy a better mouse down the road. Oh, and this is great too....if you don't touch the mouse for a while it goes into a hibernation mode and you need to click the mouse to be able to move the cursor. That's almost as annoying as the squeaking...almost."
1,Works fine for &lt; 1 month,"I purchased two of these for home use. Each worked fine for nearly 1 month before going bad. Batteries were replaced, S/W re-installed, etc. Less than 2 weeks later my daughter's went bad as well.Horrible reliability combined with a tremendous amount of frustration over something so simple..."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"Today I took the challenge and purchased the GE Wireless Optical Mouse (HO97990) at my local Target. Sadly, I will be returning it tomorrow. I thought my experience with other wireless meeses on other computers would adequately prepare me for installing this product. It didn't. Although the lights on both the receiver and mouse worked and I changed the AAA batteries, my attempts to get them to synch were fruitless. I walked away after several hours empty handed, never experiencing wireless computing at home. Tomorrow, I'll be replacing my regular mouse with another."
1,Horrible,"The advertisement says it uses the most advance radio technology, well they have some major bugs to work out before the ""most advanced' technology works. This mouse frozen my PC every time I booted it AND the RF would not even go through 1/2 inch wood desk with glass top. What a joke, because the manual suggests that you mount the receiver UNDER your desk. LOL. Just reinstall my Logitech cordless ball mouse and back up and running. Save yourself the time and money and look at some other optical."
1,BROKE DOWN IN 3 MONTHS,WORKED GREAT AFTER GETTING USED TO IT. X-CELLENT FOR INTERNET (BACK BUTTON)QUIT WORKING IN 3 MONTHS-THIS SUCKS!!!
1,Not worth it,"I've had this device for maybe 5 months now and it's not responding anymore. I didn't even like it from the start when this ""wireless"" mouse had a bulky silver blob pictured above attached to a wire. I was so jealous when I saw a friend of mine have a 2-inch device sticking up from his USB port with a wireless mouse he's used for over a year. This product is almost like being attached with a cord since it is so bulky. And now it doesn't even work..."
2,Taking it back!,"I have to agree that this mouse is very ANNOYING. The delay in pointer action from the ""Power Savings Mode"" is not tolerable. It is a good idea in theory to extend battery life, but the makers of this mouse missed the mark with this very bad side effect. This was my first attempt at using a wireless/optical mouse. It is going back and will be exchanged for another brand. How did they put this product out on the market with such a glaring flaw? Unbelievable."
1,Not as advertised,"This item arrived and was nearly twice the size as advertised! It did not fit in the space I had in mind for it, so I had to return it. Amazon is great with returns, so it wasn't a problem. BEWARE--Don't believe the dimensions, even if they are in the product name!"
4,"Holds a ""bunch""","This fruit holder arrived well packed and ready to use. The bottom holds quite a bit of fruit and the banana holder is sturdy. When we do not have bananas, the top is removable which is convenient."
1,Very cheap & flimsy!,"I needed a fruit bowl to hold up my bananas and keep them fresh. If you have fruit in the bowl and bananas, they don't hang. They just lay on top of the fruit. The upper hook part is very weak, and bends under the weight of the bananas.I did contact the seller and was able to get my money back. I will look for something stronger, and will buy in person!"
1,Huge piece of crap,"This didn't even survive shipping. The box was too big for the product and did not have any packing material other than brochures and a Taylor Gifts catalog. I should have known..One of the legs was broken off. I can't even tell if there was even a weld. I'm afraid to hang bananas on it because I don't want that part to break off as well, which is why I bought it. Don't waste your money. It's also made in China."
3,It is OK,It is serving it's purpose. The holder for the bananas is a little flimsy and the bananas pull it down so it crowds the bowl that holds the fruit.
3,Arrived deformed (great delivery time),"It just arrived today ,and it was sooner than i even expected .packing The basket itself wasn't good so the box good beat up and the basket isn't as sturdy as it looks so it got bent and I had to straighten it by hand. ,it holds a good quantity of fruits,but after you hang the bananas its legs were not even on the counter so had to adjust that too by just forcing it down for the legs to be all one height."
2,Disappointed,"The bowl part is nice but the stem that holds the bananas is not strong enough. It bends in with the weight. Ive tried to bend it back a bit, but then it looks like someone tried to straighten it. Not too happy with this. I'd send it back but it would cost more than its worth."
2,"Beautiful, but bad quality",I bought this and loved it for a week before I tried to hang bananas and the base tonges snapped and broke. I would recommend buying a little more for something that works.
2,Looks good but a little flimsy.,This bowl looks good and matches some other things that I have in my kitchen. The only problem in that the banana hook is weak and bends under the weight of the bananas. i was torn on whether to send it back but I really wanted something to match my other stuff and this is the only thing I have found so I am going to stick with it and see how it holds up.
4,Fruit Bowl,This fruit bowl is just the right size for my small kitchen counter and sells at a great price. I am glad I purchsed it.
5,Fruit Stand,Keeps all my fruit especially banans all together and out off my counters which leaves more room for other stuff. looks great with my black granit countertops!
2,Partly Truth and Partly Fiction - A Walking Contradiction,"This book sets-up the story of Marine boot camp slowly. The author sets up the main character with plenty of back-story, including a romantic interest that feels contrived. The first act, so to speak, is set up well. But the payoff never really comes once the recruit hits Paris Island. Once a big plot twist comes, introducing an unexpected antagonist, the novel becomes episodic, without dramatic tension. The writer does manage to write some compelling scenes, but 3/4 of the episodic stories don't really work.If you want a realistic, colorful account of boot camp on Parris Island, read ""Parris Island Daze"" by Bob Shirley."
4,"Not Stamping Ground, but...","Well, after the real dissapointment of Proterra, this is a return to form for Runrig. For me, the very best studio album produced by the band is The Stamping Ground, and if you haven't got that, get it. This, however, has the same gutsy edge to its songs, and the same depth of realism in the lyrics.I love Brian's inclusion on lead vocals in 'Something's Got To Give' - a lovely ballad, and there are several songs that will be sung along to by Runrig fans for a long time to come.The doom-sayers of the mid-nineties are eating their words now, as the band go on turning out wonderfully crafted songs with commitment and honesty. Bruce has more than filled Donnie's shoes, and brought a slightly more sophisticated touch.All in all, this is another 'must-have' from the boys."
2,not what I expected,"I had heard great things about this book but was overall disappointed with it. It seems like every time I used it, the verb I was trying to find wasn't listed. I also bought it with the hopes that it would have all 6 principal parts for every verb listed, but it does not. For those less familiar with greek verbs it could be a worthwhile purchase, but anyone who has a solid knowledge of verbs and their principal parts probably won't get much use out of this book. I RARELY use it."
3,Only half a Conjugational,"This book shows all the verb forms in their alphabetical order. That is good if you're parsing a verb, for then you can look up the verb form under consideration. However, this book does not fully conjugate the verbs in the same sense as the ""501"" books do, for they have each verb fully conjugated separately, so you can take in the verb at a glance and as a whole - this one has all the forms of one verb scattered over the book, for the verb forms are in alphabetical order. That is kind of unpractical, for it would be much better to have a ""501 Koine Greeks Verbs Fully Conjugated"", for then you could learn the verbs much faster."
2,beginners' level,"The few times I looked something up in this book, I could not find it. I presume it was not there because the verb form was rare or not the most common one for that tense. Unfortunately, that was what I bought this book for. However beginners may indeed find it very helpful. Once you reach an intermediate level, you will have to use something else."
1,Pointless!,"Yes this book conjugates all of the Greek verbs. There is just one problem. It doesn't translate any of it to English. So you can see all of the Greek verbs, but you don't know what any of them mean unless you are already fluent in Greek."
5,Live concert by versatile Polish singer,"She sings in Polish, she sings in English, rock, pop, jazz, blues.. she does it all, and does it all fantastically. She does a kicking version of Led Zep's 'Black Dog' that segues into several of her own hard rocking Polish songs. Fabulous versions of 'New York State of Mind' and 'Don't Rain on my Parade' as well as a medley of standards provide great English content, while her own 'Kto Moze To Dac' is a hauntingly beautiful Polish ballad. Kasia has a fantastic voice, and writes a good deal of her own material. This CD would be a good choice as an introduction to Kasia's talents for non-polish speaking people."
2,Lacks Evidence,Glasser takes an idea that has some merit and then keeps pushing it long after it becomes unhelpful. Glasser would have teachers quit using rewards and punishments to motivate students. He tries to justify this warm and fuzzy theory by pointing out misuses of rewards and punishments but its hard to understand how he could be blind to productive and fair uses of rewards and punishments that many teachers use. I know a poor teacher that use Glasser's model and a teacher that is good despite using it. If you want more objective research on schooling check out Stevenson and Stigler's the Learning Gap.
3,Interesting somewhat,"This is a book about a college age guy back in the 1930s. He and his friend build a house boat to save money on rent. The plan becomes to float down the Mississippi from around the Twin Cities in Minnesota. They mess around until the weather gets bad and only make it about to LaCrosse WI. Kind of typical kids, can not get their stuff together to make anything happen. Not a great book by any means, but somewhat interesting if you like the Mississippi River."
3,A fine furry novel (3 1/2 stars),I'd been given a copy of the novel by a friend because the lead character was a tiger (long story) and rather enjoyed it. The author creates a believable origin for his anthropomorphic characters and the political world around them. The storyline was not altogether satisfying at some points and had an overly complicated conclusion. But it is the author's ability to draw on the lead character's animal nature that pulls me back to reread the book. 'Forests of the Night' is a fine furry novel and I would recommend it to anyone out there with an inner tiger. Obey your hidden stripes and read the book.
4,A original and well concieved thriller.,"Forests of the Night is a fine book that portrays the main character as a tiger derived geneticlly engineered private investigator. Set about a century from now it is an exellent and overdue quantum leap for the old detective stories that have been so popular in years past. Within the story there is some entertaining violence, sex and ventures into multi-cultural cohabitation and relations. I recommend this book even if you have never had a ""thing"" for detective tales. This evolved thriller is so much more, it could be a whole new genre in itself. I give Forests of the Night four out of five stars."
5,a great book found in a second hand store,"i grabbed this book because i like a) science fiction 2) detective stories 3) animals. i was expecting it to not be very good. i read all night until it was done! okay, i actually DID guess one part of the plot, but i thats because of my bio background. what kept me in was the emotional bond he forged with the characters and me. i am now looking up any and all other books he wrote so i can acquire and devour them as well."
1,disappointment,"It's sad to be excited about a book beacause of all the good reviews here on Amazon, and then to find it is filled with racial stereotypes. I suppose this book is fine for people of European descent, but people of color like myself might be put off by the use racial slurs like ""Japs"" and ""wetbacks"" which are used by the main character. Am I supposed to like this character? The dipiction of black people also left me saddened. This book wasn't written in the 50's, was it? And here I thought he was going to be using the concept of the moreau as a critique of rasicism as opposed to more of the same old, same old."
2,PDA is great - Phone quality is poor,"Aside from locking up and needing rebooting twice in 2 months the PDA is fine, however the voice quality incoming and outgoing is less than quality... I am going back to my digital cell and keeping the PDA"
2,Love the PDA / Hate the Phone,"Before buying the SX66, I was a believer in pen and paper. After the purchase, however, I have fallen in love with my PDA. Let me high light the pros and cons for you:Pros:* the speaker phone. Wonderful!* the ability to synchronize all my information on my PC using Outlook* being able to show digital pictures* the ability to listen to music without using headphones. Sure the sound quality is poor, but it is still a nice feature* the easy access buttons for everything* the ability to check e-mail anywhere* the familiarity of WindowsCons:* The phone quality is terrible!!!! Please listen to me: If you need a phone that is clear, that won't drop calls, that is comfortable to use, and that will not anger every caller you talk with, don't by the SX66. Siemens help desk even admitted to me that this is the devises plaguing problem."
5,Blue tooth fixed,This is a great unit.I notice one of the reviews mentions Lexus bluetooth problems. I had that also and I was unoffically directed to the XDA developers site. The SX66 has an older bluetooth build and the new build is at that site and it easily corrects the problems. My SX and my 400h are now happily married.
1,Siemens SX66,"I have had this PDA for a year and I do not recommnd buying this device. The battery constantly falls out. Most of the time the inforamtion is restored upon re-installation of the battery, but not always. Several times I have had to re-load and re-synch all of my programs, etc. Also, the phone locks up after 10 calls have been restered in the phone history. You must delete the call history or you cannot place calls. The phone will dial, but time out with never connecting the call.I do not thi9nk Windows Mobile is as robust and reliable as the Palm OS platform. I've had both and the Palm platform is more crash-proof."
1,Didn't work for my Tippmann custom 98!!!!!,"The item took forever to be delivered for such a simple 1st class envelope! The trigger was installed in less than 5 minutes-(very easy to do). After installation the safety was hesitant to work properly and the gun wouldnt fire, at times it would shoot but for the most part this trigger is junk! thank god i only paid 9 bucks with free shipping for this piece of useless crap. Buy a saber tooth style trigger made of billet aluminium and you will not go wrong, It sucks that i didnt read the feedback and reviews on this so called double trigger before i wasted time and money- 1 star for the bogus double trigger!"
1,GARBAGE,i bought this item and waited 3 days just to get a pathetic plastic trigger THAT DID NOT WORK. i recomen that you trash the idea of buying a double trigger or at least dont buy one from this company
5,Great resource for those serious about learning the Greek NT,"I am so pleased with this in may ways. It presents the NT Greek vocabulary in multiple ways that allow you to study it the way you like, by roots, by frequency, and alphabetically (with relevant info listed). He provides a comprehensive listing of verbs and their principle parts-not just samples, but all verbs in all their principle parts! I used Metzger's guide years ago, and that is a great book. But this goes so far beyond that. Highly recommended!"
1,Please Improve!,"I have been savoring Tony Packo's since 1968. The Hungarian Hot Dog they serve is phenomenal! And the Chicken Paprikash (Csirke Paprikas) is excellent! Unfortunately, this 7.5 ounce canned sauce is thin and contains a whopping 56 grams of fat (2 tablespoons is the serving size)! I used a strainer spoon to separate out some beef. Only buy the canned stuff if you're desperate. I had to scoop out a thick layer of fat before heating. Unfortunately, the frozen sauce is no longer available.The dogs served at the restaurant (2 per order with a side of Pickles & Peppers) are easily edible without a fork and have the perfect combination of mustard, thick rich sauce and onion. The place is a well maintained institution since 1932 with friendly staff and should be on your list of places to go while in the Toledo Ohio area. See their website for details.http://www.tonypackos.com"
3,"DVD is ok, TTouch holds promise","I have a very anxious and high strung cat. He's only two years old and is exhibiting some bad behaviors. We love this little guy very much and we are trying to help him. So, I ordered this DVD as I had hoped that learning more about TTouching would help him.While I believe Ms. Tellington-Jones is very knowledgeable and I believe the TTouch system holds promise; I was disappointed in the DVD. I was hoping it would go into greater depth and provide more information than it did."
1,PU,sometimes i buy a cd i think might be good but isn't...there is no such suspense involved with this cd...obviously a stinker here..
4,Incredible error in Navigation,"The story of incompetent navigation and the fallacy of blindly ""follow the leade""r is brilliantly illustrated in this book.The heroic rescue operation leaves the reader in awe."
5,Insightful,"this is not just a useful book for artists, writers etc.. but for anyone! I decided to check out some of Anna Deavere Smith's work after i saw her on ted.com. Highly recommended."
2,"Interesting words, cheap quality book!","Purchased this book on the advice of a distant friend who read it. Attempted to read it, but during the first few days, day three to be exact, the book physically fell apart.The quality of assembly is so poor that the section of the book literally just fell apart. So unfortunately my money was spent on some glue in an attempt to fix this book.I finished reading the book, and it was interesting. Upon finishing the book, I tossed it in the recycling bin as it is of less quality than a cheap love novel of the ""Har.....in""name in quality. Could not even attempt to sell it to a second hand shop...they didn't want it. Gargage assembly. What a shame. I hope the author is aware of this as itlessens her associative quality as well. I would borrow first before buying....let someone else pay for it."
5,"Pleasure, inspiration AND education.","Nonfiction with all the excitement of a novel. It reads easily, stays on track, holds the reader's interest and has to have wide appeal. How a physician barely survives a frightening disease and manages to achieve some lifelong dreams in the face of extreme adversity. It offers special insight to all of us as potential patients or medical providers, with some special appeal to runners and endurance athletes."
5,Perfect For Summer,I bought this tray to carry items from the kitchen to the patio for outdoor dinning. It works perfectly and is a good size making easy to carry everything in one trip. It is also made of a very tough plastic so it very durable and hand washes easily.
3,Disappointed,"Well, the trays arrived very quickly and they are what I ordered/what I saw in the picture HOWEVER they are both EXTREMELY sticky!!!! I don't know what on earth is all over them but both of them are just SO STICKY!!!! I am debating on whether I should return them or try to get the stickiness off myself . . . I don't want to ruin the finish on the trays though. SO FRUSTRATING!!!!! When you order something you shouldn't have to plan on scrubbing stickiness off of it before you can actually use it!!!!!"
3,Lg Zak Tray,Partitions inside the tray (or the option for that) would be nice - An edge where holes are (for handles) would be nice to prevent spilled liquids from running out.
2,Tray does its job but cracks easily,The tray does its job as a serving tray. It feels sturdy and heavy. But then I dropped it on my kitchen floor (only a couple feet from the floor) and cracked in half. Really disappointed that it cracked so easily.
5,very good tray,Love this tray. we use it for our tea set and i really love it . its deep too very nice looking.
4,I need more!!!,I thought this was a great book! I am currently trying to implement this theory into my classroom. My only dissappointment is that I felt like I needed step by step instructions on how to implement this plan into my classroom and all Glasser offered were a few examples and then other books I should buy and read.
2,Fashionable Nonsense,Glasser takes an idea that has some merit and then keeps pushing it long after it becomes unhelpful. Glasser would have teachers quit using rewards and punishments to motivate students. He tries to justify this warm and fuzzy theory by pointing out misuses of rewards and punishments but its hard to understand how he could be blind to productive and fair uses of rewards and punishments that many teachers use. I know a poor teacher that use Glasser's model and a teacher that is good despite using it. If you want more objective research on schooling check out Stevenson and Stigler's the Learning Gap.
3,nice but small,"this is a very nice, but small, bowl. the next size up is a lot more money so this is worth it."
2,Royal Scandal Review,To think this is a real story is very sad. I thought it was extremely hilarious how the King was crying with a broken heart. He never was constant to anyone but his own toilet and himself so much so that he spent 20lbs a week on. To think these people ruled the kingdom. I guess it's really no different today I'm sure.I would borrow from library instead of paying the price. This is one you only want to watch once if even that.
2,I'LL TRY TO BE GENTLE HERE...,"THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE CONFUSING MOVIES IVE EVER SEEN. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCTION CREW QUIT HALFWAY THRU THE FILMING AND THE STAR PRETTY MUCH FINISHED IT HIMSELF ALONG WITH THE VARIOUS AND SUNDRY CO-STARS WHO ARE ACTUALLY REAL LIFE RESIDENTS OF PIONEERTOWN CALIFORNIA! I BOUGHT THIS OUT OF CURIOSITY BECAUSE IM A REGULAR VISITOR TO THAT LOVELY HIGH DESERT TOWN BUT WHY ALL THE CORNY JOKES AND LINE DANCING IS BEYOND ME. ITS ONE REDEEMING QUALITY IS WE GET TO SEE THE LATE GREAT ""PAPPY"" ON SCREEN. BUY IT IF YOU KNOW THESE FOLKS, OTHERWISE ID RECOMMEND ""PLAN NINE FROM OUTERSPACE""."
1,Crying tears it was so god-awful.,"I thought the movies lampooned by MST3K were bad movies. I was wrong. I thought every film had some redeeming factor, no matter how small. I was wrong. I thought the line dancing scenes would end... I WAS WRONG! DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN I WAS WRONG I was wrong I can't believe a movie this bad was made couldn't they have put a label on the box about the damnable line dancing."
2,not bad,"this movie is doesn't deliever real good suspense or kills. The polt isn't taht well done and is a little slow, but is pretty good over all"
1,Worst horror film ever made,"This movie sucked!! There were hardly any werewolf scenes in it and the few times we did see a werewolf, it looked real fake. Most of the movie was a bunch of drunken rednecks squaredancing. This movie is an utter discrace to the howling series."
1,Utterly Worthless!,"Clive Turner (director, writer and star) can be blamed for the decline of the Howling series since his involvement began with part three. Here he takes the entire process on himself, trashing the series with what is not only the worst horror film but absolutely the worst movie of all time! Yes, it is that bad! Witness line dancing sequences that roll before your eyes for lengthy periods of time, Turner himself hamming it up in front of the camera with stupid human tricks and a severe case of egomania, a werewolf that makes the kiddie masks at your local dime store appear realistic and last but certainly not least a host of actors who couldn't act their way out of a shallow grave. And that is where this pathetic celluloid trash should have gone in the first place... into a shallow grave! Horribly written, ineptly directed I suggest you ignore this lousy excuse for a movie at all costs!"
1,LMAO,ok I saw this movie when it was relesed in 1995 and I can still remember that mostly the ENTIRE movie was rednecks dancing in a bar to country-western music. There were only a few scenes of a warewolf and they wernt that scary. I remember laughing the entire movie I think the makers of this film were having a good time and forgot what the movie was supposed to be about! LOL! Because they definatly over-did it with the bar scenes. I felt like I was watching a 2 hour hoe-down rather that a horror movie.
1,Howling 7,"THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE. I like horror movies and loved parts 1,2,3,4,and 5(part 6 was bad too but had vampire vs. werewolf action WAY before Underworld was released), but this Razzi is why the Razzi awards were invented. This is so bad I wanted to return it!NOT WORTH A PENNY and whoever produced this movie in Hollywood should be FIRED!"
4,"You can see ""The Howling"" mythos breaking down...","Pretty decent film, despite low budget on just about anything and everything. Please note I don't give out stars like these free, though. Clive Turner (the director) obviously spent a great deal of time planning this film for the well-rounded movie goer. Sure, It can be shoved into the ""Horror"" genre, but it also contains multiple instances of comedy, drama, and even a dash of romance if you look hard enough. A good flick to rent, but to buy? I'm not so sure."
1,No negative stars?,"Ok, I enjoy watching the B-est of B flicks. I like cheesy low budget films. This does not even classify as a B flick. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not even watch the entire thing (rare for me), though not from a lack of trying. The entire time in this movie people are just standing around in a bar telling bad jokes that you have heard a million times. Then for no reason they will cut to a scene with people line dancing to country western music in a dark room with light shining in through an open door. When they finally did get around to having a werewolf scene it was not remotely scary, horror like, or even cheesy. It was just sad. I would advise avoiding this movie like the plague, though the plague would probably be more fun."
1,Worst movie of all time,"Not only is this the worst werewolf movie, not only is this the worst horror movie, it is the worst movie of all time!!! The werewolf scenes were so cheap looking, the acting was terrible, and half the movie was about a bunch of drunk rednecks dancing to country music. They didn't even show the werewolf till the end; and it was a cheap computer-morph of a girl turning into one. Then finally when this God-awful movie was almost over and the town people were gonna kill the werewolf they didn't even show it. Don't ever think about buying this movie, i'd rent it with some friends and make fun of it cuz that is all it is worth. The makers of the original ""Howling"" must have crapped their pants when they saw this movie.If you want a great werewolf movie get the original Howling or American Werewolf in London. If you are bored and have a couple of bucks to waste go rent this movie with some friends and let the laughter begin."
1,Dynomax RICE Bullet,"I installed this muffler on my 97 Chevy S-10 4.3L, along with JBA headers and a Magnaflow high flow cat. Sounds great at idle, gets a little raspy on free revs but not bad. What kills me though is that if I go past about 1/3 throttle or over 2500 rpm while driving, it sounds like a Civic with a cheap fart can on it. The noise comes on suddenly, is at least twice as loud as before 2500 rpm, and is incredibly obnoxious. I had a cheap generic glasspack on the truck before and it did not sound anything like this. So glad I wasted $40 on this piece of garbage..."
4,"Great story, but one flaw","The ending of this story was rewritten to make a seamless transition into the next story, Planet of the Daleks. Because of this, we never find out what becomes of the Master. He just vanishes without explanation. Sadly, real-life events made it impossible to write the Master into the next story, as Roger Delgado was tragically killed in a car crash in Turkey shortly after the filming of Frontier was completed.Roger Delgado is awesome here. It's worth owning this one just to see his mocking tirade of the Daleks in episode six, referring to them as ""stupid tin boxes"", easily outsmarted."
2,The worst of Dr. Who,"I am a huge Dr. Who fan, but Frontiers in Space tests even my patience. This terribly written set runs six 25 min TV episodes, and has no conclusion. It simply runs into the next series, Planet of the Daleks. Even the lack of a conclusion to Frontiers in Space pales in my dissappointment compared to the terrible writing. For > 2.5 h the Doctor and Jo simply wander from one jail cell to another, with meaningless dialogues and zero action.Not sure why I'm giving this one 2 stars, except I'm such a big Dr. Who fan, I can't get myself to rate it 1 star. Unless you're a huge Dr. Who fan, stay away from this one."
3,A Die-hard Ringo Fan Can't Really Be Disappointed,"Although, not the best overall collection of works by Ringo, I thoroughly enjoyed hearing some new music from one of the Fab Four."
3,Copy protection sucks,This is a delightful album. But it imports to iTunes with constant audio glitches. Shame on Koch Records.
2,Ringorama Lite,"I've listened to this CD five times now. I'm really surprised at the positive reviews it is getting. I'm as big a Ringo fan as anyone and I want to like this album, but come on!! Every song sounds like Ringo and the boys are making up the melody as they go along! This disc doesn't nearly have the creativity as Time Takes Time, Verticl Man or Ringorama...or the Christmas album. After five listens there is not one song I can remember enough to sing. The album has all of Mark's cute effects like in the prevoious outings, but they've lost their charm and have gone stale here.Still love ya Ringo, just a little tough love from a die-hard fan.Stuart Fischer,Chicago, IL"
4,Great Recording from A Rock Classic,"Choose Love continues the brilliant collaboration between Ringo and Mark Hudson (from the Hudson Brothers). This collection is not quite as brilliant as its predecessor (Ringo Rama) but still has lots of charm. Outstanding tracks are the rocking Choose Love and Give Me Back The Beat, and the beautiful Oh My Lord. It is great to hear Ringo in such fine form."
5,Super comfy.. ultra cute!,"I love these boots! They feel just like a slipper.. but are so cute with jeans and a sweater, or down vest.. super adorable!! Be careful, the light color can stain or get dirty easy, and they are a bit tough to clean! Inside the coul is lined with fur!! SO awesome!"
4,Know what you're looking for!,"I have read a lot of reviews that say this item is too expensive, not enough memory... and so on. My advice is, know what your needs are before you make a purchase. Yes, the item is fairly pricey. But the cost of owning the latest technology always is. I've encoding songs using the higher, and lower compression rates, and it's difficult to tell the difference. So,............use the lower rate, thus creating a smaller file, and get more songs on your data card. I typically get about 10 songs per data card. Ok, the cards themselves are not cheap, but they're so tiny they're cool. And after all isn't that the point? I use my I-Jam when I cycle, with some street style headphones, and I don't want to carry around a MD player. I want the smallest, lightest, (yet decent sounding) player I can get.I find that this fulfills my needs, and for me is a good value for what I want. Do not be influenced by the negative reviews, this is a good product!"
4,"Not bad, but ...","I've been using the I-Jam for a week now. Here are mythoughts.Overall this is an excellent product.I bought theplayer mainly for use while running because of the fact that it has no moving parts and so can be shaken without interrupting the music. On this score - 10 / 10. It performs beautifully. It is a perfect size and the FM radio gives you something to listen to when you are bored of the MP3 tracks that you have downloaded.Just a few minus points.1. It eats batteries - I think this has something to do with the fact that if you ""pause"" the player rather than ""power off"" - it doesn't ""auto-off"" after a while.2. I bought the Parallel version and haven't been able to get Win2000 drivers for it.I wrote to the Tech Support group a week ago about this - no reply. END"
5,great player for the price,"WOW! i got this yesterday.. and for the [final] price, i would say this is the best out there. the memory disks are incredibly small, and the only drawback is that they only hold about 5 songs each. the connector was extremely easy to install. you can record songs on to the disks just as you use a floppy. the player itself is small too, with great sound and decent earbuds. instead of getting other more expensive models i would buy four of these. the player is the smallest i've seen, like 1.5 inches * 4 inches. BUY IT IF YOU CAN!"
2,get higher end mp3 player,"I got this mp3 player as a gift. You can only hold 4 songs per memory card--this really sucks. Who's going to want to just listen to 4 songs, and then have to switch memory cards? After using it just once, I gave it to my little sister. Also transferring files is somewhat inconvenient. For some reason, they decided to use the parallel port--have they ever heard of something called USB???"
2,Not Quite Ready for Prime Time,"I-Jam has a lot of promise, very small and includes an FM radio, but does not support RealMedia files and customer support is lacking. Errors occurred during software installation; and, the cable for the scanmedia did NOT include a printer connection. Also, I had difficulty reaching I-Jam for support (unanswered phone calls and Email). When I finally did reach them, they were not very friendly. After this, I bought an RCA Lyra and it's been quite good."
2,Ijam mp3 player shipped defective,"I bought this player a few days ago. Had it shipped via FedEx only to find out it was defective, and had been marked on the unit (not the box) as such.That's minus a point in my book.Though it really is darn small and has a radio which most mp3 players don't (at least not in this price range). So I'm gonna try again one more time to see if Ijam can ship me a product that isn't defective."
2,spend a little more money and get a better quality one,"This mp3 player is worth $30 dollars, but it would be wise to put in more money and buy a better one. The good points about this player is it's compact size and that it includes a free carrying case and headphones, but the cards which say 16mb only actually hold 15.2mb, the FM radio only works in places with good reception and my computer sometimes jams and I have to reboot when i try to download some music into the discs."
4,"A nostalgic, atmospheric noir","This review is for 'dial 1119'. A good nostalgic piece of post war, big city America catching the pessimistic atmosphere of those days. The story, casting and photography are excellent in showing the big let down occurring after the big hopes of winning the war were dashed by the boredom, drudgery and personal problems, inescapable elements of modern life. The story of an escaped lunatic holding a few innocents hostage could have been a metaphore for the then red menace. A good noir of America 60 years ago which some of us can vividly remember."
2,Weak,I think this series was one collection too many.Head and shoulders above the rest was Deadline at Dawn. The others were either bad or too boring to finish.
1,What happened to the fact that Phenix City was off limits to the military,Very poorly done. When I was stationed in Fort Benning this film did not depict actuallity of what was really going on as far as the military.
2,OMG - Are you serious???,"Um, I don't know where to start; so here it goes.This video is very very (did I say very?) low budget. There was something about the quality of acting also. However, the cover of the video is very appealing!The portrayal of the pastor in this movie is the same that millions experience in real-life today; however, the quality of the directing & the acting just didn't fit the bill.*I did very well as I didn't want to use the word 'Ghetto' to describe this film as there is a large target audience that loves those types of movies*- Just horrible - however, it's horribly funny parts in this film as well-"
2,Picturers Blurry,"I received this cam last year as a gift. I've only used it twice, because the images are so blurry. I'm giving it away for free to anyone who wants it. Waste of money!"
5,Be prepared for a musical extravaganza,"People at first classified this band as a typical grunge band--riding on the coat tails of others. This album as well as their masterpiece of a second album reveal that this rationalization does not even begin to characterize CC and their music. First of all, Marc Byrd is a lyrical genius. He crafts images in your head that don't leave when the song is over and at the same time the words delve into your emotions. Secondly, the music is brilliant, intense, hard, soft, and...well it covers a vast array of music. Every track is a highlight although I like some less than others. ""Broken Smile"" is one of those ballads that will never go away, ""Treasure"" is a happy rocker, ""Last Time Out"" is a surreal journey while ""hate"" is a acid thrash song. They offer a tremendous variety, deep, thoughtful lyrics, beautiful vocals and harmonies and driving rifts and beats. This album is a must in any Christian alternative or just alternative collection."
2,WHAT DID THEY DO TO THESE SONGS???,"Firstly, Gmotfotw is classical, not techno. They made Porcelain sound like a religious evangelism! And they turned South Side into a soul and r&b song! It's not! God, I hate this album."
3,"Black Sun: The Battle of Summit Springs, 1869 (Plainsmen)","I was somewhat disappointed by this #4 book of the Plainsmen series. The plot was not very cohesive and drifted; actvities between the main character and Bill Cody seemed contrite and campy. However, I still like the series and will likely buy number 5."
3,Cavalry-Indian hostilities on the plains,"The Battle of Summit Springs in July of 1869 is the subject of the fourth book in Terry C. Johnston's ""Plainsmen Series"". This engagement is sometimes referred to as Major Eugene A. Carr vs. Tall Bull of the Cheyennes. The Indians, specifically the warrior society known as ""Dog Soldiers"", raided in Kansas and Colorado at will, terrorizing ranchers and wagon trains and kidnapping white women and children. Carr's Fifth Cavalry was dispatched to seek and destroy the Indians and put a stop to the depredations once and for all. Carr was guided by Buffalo Bill Cody and Pawnee scouts in searching for the Indian village until it was located at Summit Springs. Seamus Donegan, Johnston's fictional hero, rides side by side with Buffalo Bill throughout the pages of the adventure. This story doesn't quite measure up to Johnston's first three books but his fans will nevertheless enjoy this historical novel."
3,More about Marketing Your Writing,"This book really focus more on how to sell your travel stories to magazines, guidebooks and newspapers. It does have some good tips about what not to do (i.e. using cliches). But I was disappointed because I was more interested in learning how to write a book about my travels. I'm not particularly interested in publishing it, but just wanted good tips on putting it altogether. Also, I agree with one of the reviewers that the interviews with several writers got to be quite redundant."
2,Disapointed,"This book is not about ""how to write a book about Travel Writing"" but how to market it, how to find places to sell it, etc. In all, not even ten pages of usefull stuff about writing about yours travels, what I was looking for. But, if you want adresses and become ""pro"" perhaps, it could help some."
4,Great Game,This game is really fun. The graphics are outstanding. You can actually see snow and rain falling down. The control is good and there are no dumb camera angles. I recommend trying the demo of the first level before buying it
3,Modern Library Edition: Unabridged & No Index,"The three-star review reflects that it's an abridged edition -- not a deal-breaker, since few lose sleep over missing passages when a book is well over 1200 pages. But what really rankles is the lack of an index. I don't have any other edition to compare this to, but publishing a 1200+ page history book WITHOUT an index is a form of sadism."
2,"Hey, Ed! I Only Have 16 Years of Schooling-Take it Easy","The title of this piece is more of a plea than a statement, but then again, I don't think Ed can hear me regardless.For non-academics which I surely am, this tome is unreadable. While I wasn't exactly contemplating an easy read, I never expected a rapture equaling the best/worst Shakespeare had to offer with his 21,000 word vocabulary. I don't doubt nor argue the positive critiques of Gibbon's masterpiece but hey, I read for pleasure with a certain amount of enlightenment thrown in. This stuff is beyond my pay grade.Good luck to all of you there getting ready settle down for the first time with this goliath of 17th century prose. Bring your lunch!The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3"
3,"Essential, Important, but over-rated","You've got to read Gibbon, IMO, to be educated about separation of Church and State, about the history of ideas, and, as many have noted, about Roman and Christian history itself.That said, I think Gibbon's gifts as a writer are over-rated.This man DOES NOT get to the point, or tend to express an over-arching theme that he can point to with facts in an explicit way. Rather, he takes a roundabout view of things, and ferreting out the main point or theme is difficult amidst all the ancillary material presented. Gibbon would be a flop as a journalist, or as a corporate communicator today.As a better example of history well-written, try the Pelican History of the World, by J. M. Roberts.However, with that exception, Gibbon's style and wit are worthy of emulation."
2,"Mildly interesting, but long-winded.","Many of these debunkings are ones you have heard before. Some are not and are mildly interesting, but most of the time the author cannot give sure explanations for the ""real"" origins, just what he thinks are ""most likely"". In addition, the explanations start out with a long-winded description of what the myth is and how many sources he found with it wrong, to the degree that I lose interest and start skimming, looking for the real origin, (the reason for the book in the first place!) which is often easily missed in the long narrative. Better to just glance at the phrases he addresses and assume that whatever you thought you knew about them is probably wrong and save your time."
3,Eh....,"I've read other novels written by Kristin Hannah that I have enjoyed much more than ""Distant Shores"". It wasn't unreadable, just predictable and very cheesy. I was almost annoyed by the wishy-washy main character and her too perfect family. I would recommend other novels by Hannah before this one.... Disappointing."
2,Boring....,"It was painful for me to get through this book. I just finished reading ""Night Road"" by Hannah and I could not put it down! I even took it to work with me so I could read it any spare moment I got!! After that I went to the library to check out more Hannah books....this was my next one and I was so disappointed. I really just found this to be a boring story, and it was difficult for me to even finish to book. I am giving Hannah one more shot with Firefly Lane...Hopefully I will not be disappointed with that one too.But as for Distant Shores....I do not recommend....Keep your Distance!"
3,Distant Shores as a Book club choice,"This is a quick and easy read for any ladies book club. It's an every day story. Perhaps best as an over the summer choice- I have never read a Kristin Hannah before and she left me wanting something more. I did like the main character's stepmother...she had a lot of chutzpah- would love to see a story based on her. Otherwise, this story provided some interesting situations that provoked a lively discussion at our book club."
4,Great story!,"Awesome story of love, love lost and love re found. Also reminds you to never lose yourself or ignore your dreams."
4,Book Distant Shores: Kirstin Hanna,Kirstin Hannah is a very great author. I have always enjoyed her books. the subject matter is an issue every woman faces between age 40 to 50 and she had stayed home to raise her family. Its hard because you have not used your education in a career and most employers are interested in young people. The ending was a surprise because She give up her art too easily and did what was a comfort zone getting back with her husband. He kinda got off scott free again.
5,First time reading Kristin Hannah and LOVE her!,"This is the first time I have read anything by this author. I have now purchased 3 more books by Hannah. I read Luanne Rice, Danielle Steel and Nicholas Sparks. I buy their books the day they hit the shelves. Since I was headed to the beach for a two week vacation and they had not come out with a new book I had to have something for the beach chair reading.I purchased Distant Shores. I now have visited the local book store and bought 3 more to read! I hope this is enough to get me through another 10 days! If not, I'm sure there are more books out there by Hannah.Try a book by her if you want to read and not have to really think too much; a great beach chair book!!!GREAT Summer READ!!"
3,"Left me wondering...""Why does she even love him?""","I didn't think this book was that good, especially having read her other book Firefly Lane. Jack, the main man, doesn't have any redeeming qualities other than his internalized love for his wife and daughters. He is selfish, cheats on his wife multiple times, neglects her, and doesn't consider her feelings before making major changes to their lives. But he ""loves"" her. I was just left wondering what exactly does she see in this guy? He is handsome and they have chemistry? He misses her after she leaves him? Doesn't seem like much to me. I gave it three stars because it wasn't exactly bad and it did hold my attention. Also, having an inside look at an old marriage was interesting to me. But honestly, there are better books out there."
2,Predictable,"I have enjoyed other books by Kristin Hannah, therefore, looked forward to reading Distant Shores. The book is very predictable and focuses on Birdie living a life of redecorating and more redecorating. Character was living in dreamland while her wayward husband search to get back to stardom. Well he found stardom, but got a bigger ego than his college days and what do the readers think of his ""cheating"" on his wife? Did he ever confess to her that he wasn't faithful? In today's society, that maybe OK, but is it living up to the standards of the author's good quality writing and true to her readers? Overall I was disappointed with this story."
3,"Schmaltzy, Predictable but Enjoyable.","I read this book while on vacation and rather enjoyed it's simplistic subject (wife and mother whose 'lost' herself) and easy flow. I thought it a perfect 'poolside' book, nothing more, nothing less.The only real 'groaner' part for me was when the step-mother miraculously changed from Dolly Parton-like to a bun-wearing granny type."
5,Distant Shores by Kristin Hannah,"The author tells an excellent and realistic story of what often happens in marriage.Kristin Hannah is a gifted storyteller. Distant Shores is my lst read, I'mhoping that her other books live up to this extraordinary account of how real peole feel!"
2,distant shores,Distant Shores is my least favorite book of Hannah's so far. I have read 8 or 9 of her books and I just did not like this one. It was boring and the book stay at the same pace from beginning to end. On top of that knowing really happened as you read and you knew from the beginning how it would end.
1,Bruce lee was not in this film,"Unfortunately you can't give less then one star. Bruce Lee was not in this film. It appears to be an attempt to capitalize on his fame. This is a cheap 70's 'karate movie' about a ficticious 'karate tournament' that pulls old 60's-70's low budget chinese kung foo movies and attempts to pass it off as 'bruce lee's story'. this isn't even good for laughs. too bad they don't have a pic of the cover though. Bruce Lee is written in huge letters along with his picture and uses a name close to one of his more famous movies ""fists of fury"" hoping people will buy it by accident.Don't make the mistake! He is not in this movie!"
4,I wonder what comes next,"In this follow up to his highly-acclaimed 2002 come-back album ""Footprints Live!"" Shorter has his first all acoustic studio recording since 1967. With shifting personnel and group size (from 4 to 14 pieces) Shorter presents reconstructed originals from his days with Miles Davis and new gorgeous arrangements of classical pieces. Whether seen as a subtler more sophisticated reprise of ""Footprints Live!"" or on its own, ""Alegria"" shows a side of Shorter that has been hidden for too long."
2,Easy Listening Jazz by Wayne Shorter,"I love Wayne Shorter and have been listening to him for a long time. This recording is nothing but easy listening jazz, and would be better suited to Kenny G or even Lawrence Welk. Sure, Shorter plays a few lines here and there that G could never play, and his sound is as recognizable as ever. What's incredibly uninspired are the compositions. The backing ensemble sounds literally like the Lawrence Welk orchestra for the bulk of the proceedings. Again, yes there's a hip harmony here and there - but the great bulk of it is utter schmaltz.If this record had been put out by Kenny G or Lawrence Welk (yeah, I know he's dead) none of these people would be saying ""A master at work!!"" or ""Subtlety at its finest!!"". They'd be saying exactly what I'm saying: This is easy listening jazz.A few virtuosic runs and some A-list sideman doesn't save this date or make it something it isn't. Recommended only for Shorter completists, old folks homes and random elevators."
3,"He's brilliant, but don't play this for your girlfriend","Like most people, I discovered Wayne Shorter when he was with Weather Report. He is superb, no question. But this album is a bit off the beaten path for a guy who enjoys Van Morrison, Robben Ford and Jimmy Smith. Don't look for grooves here. However, if you give it time, it will grow on you. The musicianship and recording quality are excellent, and, even if you find some of the songs jangling (I did), you'll love the way these guys play. I wish Mr. Shorter many happy returns. He has stretched me out a bit; I may snap back to my original shape, but I will be enriched for having listened to this."
2,Too many items unavailable to Canadians!,"I was disapointed when I got this book..not by the recipes (they seem tasty, and healthy enough) but by the products used in the recipes.I am a canadian, and we cannot get a lot of the low fat/ no fat items that are listed in the recipes, also many of the brands that are used (recommended) are not available here. I had to go through each recipe, and figure out substitutes...and who knows if the recipes are as healthy or taste the same way as they were intended?? It took too much time, and effort to have to change everything...I was looking for a quick healthy recipe alternative.I want a quick healthy cookbook geared at kids that use basic products and basic brands that we can get here!A good one that I found if you are a Canadian is: Quick meals for healthy kids and busy parents ISBN# 1565610644, it is not by Candian authors...but it has everyday items that we can get here...try it first."
2,Disappointing,"I was so looking forward to using this cookbook, but the author's reliance on pre-prepared foods (canned biscuits, canned gravies/soups, etc) rather than fresh ingredients in her recipes gave them a frozen or microwave dinner flavor rather than the home cooked fresh food flavor that I would like to have if I go to all the trouble of preparing food. My daughter, who is not a picky eater, was not crazy about the food either. I am a novice cook and I think I will continue to rely on a good basic cookbook like ""How to Cook Everything"" and leave this one out of my collection."
3,Cryptically technical but with some flashes of good insight,"I was looking for more connections and illuminations to be made about this interesting language evolution. The author luxuriates in techno-babble which limits the reading to scholars at Harvard and Oxford. There are interesting passages, some sentances some paragraphs, which deal with insights into how Latin became so grammatically complex. Grammaticalization is the term used to describe how for example the complex verb and noun endings were formerly prepositions or nouns or verbs that fused to the root word to make a new word richer in meaning or nuance."
5,GREAT FOR KIDS!!,"This is a great Kids CD. Mi daughter, even she doesn't speak english really enjoys to listen it.She sings, dances and learns."
5,Daughter loves it,I have a 1 year old that loves the Backyardigans. She loves the CD. She even turns it on herself. She was very excited to open it at christmas and listens to it almost daily.
2,Not as good as the first,"I have a 16 month old and this one is definitely not as good as the original CDThe Backyardigans. My little one doesn't sing along with this one, so I've determined that she doesn't like it. Songs are not as catchy or as likeable to me. I've gone back to playing the original CD for her. Sorry."
4,"Lively , decorative illustrations and good stories","Get this book for the lively, decorative illustrations and the entertaining stories carefully re-told for children. Legends are an excellent way to begin to introduce non-Pacific children to the culture."
4,Stryper's Front Man Solo,"This is one of several solo outings for Stryper frontman Michael Sweet. Styper enjoyed success in the 1980s with two gold and one platinum album, arguably a one hit wonder with the ballad Honestly. In 1990 they released Againt the Law, where they supposedly abandoned their Christian stance and got controversy, even banned in Christian bookstores. So lead vocalist M. Sweet went solo in 1994, releasing several albums by himself. While not the overwhelming Judas Priest/Poison style of Stryper, it still is modern gospel music. Nothing heavy here, just straight gospel on guitars. Included is a Stryper cover- Always There for You. Other noteworthy tracks are: Color Blind, The River and Real. Even though you may like Stryper, this solo effort is not in that style. The real gem of a track here is Why- featuring beautiful singing by Michael. I would recommend it."
3,Uninspired,"Battletech is a tacky and slow giant robot style strategy game that is rapidly being outmoded by software that does so much more than this. Even though this game is pathetically slow - just building your own mech takes at least an hour, there is still that feel that the game presents too few things to make the gameplay interesting. Why? Because everything has to be done by hand, and this game involves a ton of calculations. You would be better advised to take your business elsewhere, or even better choose a genre that does not so gladly succumb to slowdown."
1,Yuck,I guess you either love it or you don't. I recently read that Cafe Bustelo is a great dark roast coffee for espresso so I gave it a shot. It does not even have the aroma of coffee. To me it smelled and tasted like those stale packages of motel room coffee. It's back to Starbucks Italian Roast for me.
1,POOR PERFORMANCE,"I used the first of 5 blades on 1/4"" cement board and got about 1"" of cut done (very slowly) until the blade heated up, became soft and bent, making it useless. On the second blade, I got about 2 more inches and the same thing happened. I was not heavy-handed with the blade. I didn't bother with the other 3 blades and asked amazon for a refund, which they obliged (thanks amazon). This product is totally unsatisfactory for the purpose given in its product name. The Dewalt website offers absolutely no information on it either. I checked to make sure the product was intended for the purpose I was using it for. Apparently Dewalt doesn't know either. I ended up using a chisel to get through the cement board and used a Bosch wood blade (for the same jigsaw) to finish the hole in the subfloor. I highly recommend against this product. One would be better suited to buy inexpensive rip saws and change the blades frequently than to waste money on these blades."
1,Ripoff City!!,"The game will not run! Customer Service at Activision is out to lunch -- permanently -- and not too interested. Once you've bought it, you are out of luck. And buy your computer a carbon-steel chastity belt BEFORE installing it. I gave this mess one star only because I had no lower options."
2,Not even better than GLQuake,"I'm a Quake fan and yes I got the game as well. But it was shocking to find out that this game is worse than previous ones. The deathmatch maps are just plain stupid, Quake2 had way better ones. And rocket jumps are pretty useless too as the maps don't have good places, the teleporters and those round Yellow jumping things have taken over. So if you got the game already just convert the old maps to be played in Quake3's engine. The charecters look good but the colors are a bit wierd in my vodoo3 3000 card. Unreal Tournament & Decent 3 is way better than this crap. Only good thing about the game is it's music & visuals...and I paid for it. Nothing else. I look forward to Quake 4, hope ID don't repeat the same mistake."
1,Worst game in the Quake Series,"Absolutely the worst game in the excellent Quakes. This certainly bombed the whole trilogy with its gameplay. What I hate about this game is the nonstop mindless shooting where you don't have to think. Getting killed in this game also causes alot of anger because everyone just jumps around you and constantly fires! This game is just like UT, bad. Utterly bad! I have constantly tried to like it, but failed at every attempt. Avoid at all costs!"
3,Quake 3 Arena,"The grafics are good but the one thing i did not like about it was that you could only frag poeple and you have to have more than one player to play the game.So i give this game three stars.For me i have a 1-10 point chart and i paly all the good games.The best games are killing games.I recomand: Unreal,Metal fatigue,Duke 3D,And carnovors."
2,Second to Unreal Tournament,Unreal Tournament is a far greater game. I found this game to be bland as it hasn't changed much from the original quake. Also Unreal Tournament has native support for Glide which allows me to run the game at a much higher resolution. Unreal Tournament also has 5 differnet game modes whereas Quake 3 only has Deathmatch and Team deathmatch (although eventually capture the flag will be added). I'm going to spend my money on the full version of Unreal Tournament and keep Quake 2.
1,PRETTY YET HOLLOW,Wow look at the pretty engine. THere I have said everyhting good about this. I swear progreammers are more interested in pretty than contenet. I would rather play Doom than this. Quake3 is all glitz and no depth. Where is the story? Where? It left with Romero when he went to form IonStorm
2,id blew it on this one,"I like action games and FPS's so naturally I tried out Q3A. Unfortunatly, this really stinks. The lackluster single-player is basically running around a small, uninspired map shooting and the intelligent blur that is your opponent. Speaking of AI, after the first half of the single-player game the enemies you face are literally impossible to beat unless you have cheat codes. Xaero is especially frustrating because his aim is always perfect. That's not intelligence, that's inhuman perfection. Another problem is the weapons that haven't changed (except for power and rate of fire changes) since the original Quake. I gave Q3A 2 stars because it did have an ambitious idea but it didn't make it. I also own UT (you can see my review of that too) and it is much better so buy it instead."
1,What The Hell?,"This is rapeing the Quake name now ID.......Get the Quake 1 magic and actually interesting story of Quake 1 back. Quake 3, 4, and 2 suck."
5,Best Deathmatch Around,"I've recently played the full version of Quake 3 and am completely impressed. Without question this is the best deathmatch game out there. Unreal Tournament is very good, but Q3 has a much cleaner and efficient networking interface. In short, the games are fast and furious. The graphics are also second to none. With the proper video card (one of the Diamond Viper TNT2 cards) you can see unbeleivable renderings. ID has improved everything about the earlier Quake versions from the user interface to the gameplay to the enemies. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great Game - Cheating Bots,"Id always does a great job. Graphics are wonderful and the action is insane. You need a fast system and a good video card or it will not be fun. Network connection is a must. The BOTs (AI characters) suck because they cheat. A BOT can see around corners, attack multiple targets, become harder to kill, scale in difficult based on your score and all sorts of other annoying features that human characters cannot do. I hope that Id has patch to fix the Bots."
2,Do not waste your cash!,"I was very disappointed by Quake III, compared to UT its action and graphics lack severely. Online was a joke for I couldn't get it to function, even though UT works almost perfectly. Don't waste your cash, get a real or Unreal game. Though it is kinda like Duke Nukem, only better."
4,Fast & Fun,"This is a great looking, fast playing game. It runs fine on my Celeron 450/Voodoo 3 rig at 800x600 resolution. My only wish is that the levels were a little more varied. They look fantastic, but sort of the same as one another."
4,"needs some hardware, but overall is great","This game is great, and even the one-player is alot of fun, but the problem is gettin there. You will need a SUPPORTED 3D card (Moster 2 is not one of them, which is what I had.) and DirectX7.0. The latter is downloadable at gamespot.com, but is none the less a pain to get. You will also need this GL Subsystem thinge and i got that at gamespot.com, too. But if you are a 1st person shooter fan or an overall hardcore gamer, it will be all worth it. The gameplay is great, and the controls are well done (Although I switched zoom in to the windows key inbetween Alt. and Ctrl.). I have Quake 2 and Quake 1 Shareware and I think that this game easily is gonna outsell them all, but like I said, if ya dont have a 3D card, then dot but this game uless ya wanna spend $300 on one."
3,Great potential but rushed delivery.,"The technical side of quake 3, such as the graphics, sound, and overall feel of the gameplay are superior. However compared to Unreal Tournament, the game looks like it was rushed together to release before Xmas, it does have less maps than UT, but these levels are amazing in architecture and all of them are fun to play in. In UT you can easily get lost and disoriented, in its large overwhelmingly boring levels. However unreal offers more types of built in play modes, quake3arena offers a gigantic array of beautiful character models, the graphics for this game are far past anything that has come out yet for a 3D shooter. The bots feel more human and have unique styles of play than UT's. Quake3Arena is a more hardcore ""competitive"" 3d shooter while UT is a more just for a casual fun game. Q3A is like the mortal kombat of 3D shooters. However I rate them badly for a rushed product."
5,Qauke 3 - the best,"when i got my new p3 450 last summer, quake 3 was the first thing i got. it took me 8 hours to download, but man was it worth it. teh graphics are way better than anything ive ever seen, and the gameplay is perfect - everythings jsut right. ive been following first person games since i could read, when wolfenstein was the game to play, and quake 3 is the best yet, second only ot the original quake."
1,System Requirements are misleading,"Prior to buying this game I spent a considerable amount of time ensuring that the system it was to be loaded on would meet or exceed the requirements as stated by the manufacturer. The system, a PII 400, 128Mb, Matrox G200, NT4.0 does. The game will not run. Activision confirmed that the game will not run with a G200 and NT. If you're considering buying the game you might want to check with the manufacturer to ensure you're configuration will work."
3,Is it really that good?,"This review will be cut very short. the graphics are good...very good...but not many graphics cards can handle it on middle graphics resolutions. Gameplay is OK. It gets boring after a while. Basiclly this game was over hyped, and you'll need one heck of an internet connection to run this game smoothly online. Don't expect this game to hold your attention for a long period of time."
2,Hope you have an ass kicking machine,"This was always bound to be a great title, the Quake name is like a way of printing money! but this time I am just not buying it! I don't have a very high spec PC and Quake 3 just runs like a dog! (it's a AMD K6-2 350 with 128Mb of RAM and an ATI Rage Magnum with 32Mb) my message to people out there with this spec of PC or below, don't bother with Q3, there is a very good alternative ""Unreal Tournement"" it's a brilliant title that runs sweet on my machine in 800x600 in 32 BIT colours (colors!). In summery Q3 Great title, but you will need an ass kicking spec."
2,Almost fun,"If you love DM, and I mean love DM to pieces, then Q3A is for you. It's Quakeworld with a breath of fresh new graphics. If you want something really exciting, then go somewhere else. I found the game to be very very boring. I've been playing Quake since pre Quake World and this game was a huge let down for me. There is a reason that everybody and their brother are playing TFC online....it's much more team oriented and interactive=fun. Straight DM is fun for about 10 min, for me at least. UT, Half-Life with TFC are 100 times more stimulating and fun that this game is.Q3A represents a technological leap, but not a leap in gaming."
3,Well..,I have both Unreal tournament and Quake 3. Even though I like Q3 I think UT is a better choice. Single player in Q3 totally lacks.. it gets old quickly. The multiplayer is nearly unplayable unless you have something better than 56k or something over a 600mhz processor. Don't get Q3 if you have less than a 500mhz processor..unless you have a VERY good video card. You won't be able to enjoy Q3's best quality..GRAPHICS. Im not putting Q3 down it's a revolutionary game and a good high action deathmatch... I still enjoy playing it online with other people. But check out Unreal Tournament first. UT beats Q3 in most aspects.
5,The Best Multiplayer First Person Shooter existing!,"I've played them all (first person shooters), but this is by far the most realistic, fun, graphically beautiful, and technically superior first person shooter I've played to date. If you're not on a network, the bot play is pretty decent too, but to get the most out of this game you need to play on a network. id Software has created another masterpiece - but make sure you have a decent 3d-accelerator and decent processor before you get this one going up to speed."
3,Must be more to it!,"I have to admit I've been a bit of an Unreal fan in the Quake/Unreal debate over the years. Sinlge player wise, mulitplayer and engine. I prefered Unreal to Quake 2 single player but liked Unreals bright graphics better. Quake II Multiplayer was the nuts!When Quake 3 came out I found I had played the Unreal Tournement Demo more when I first got that! It doesn't detract from a great game but any game I can complete in one evening (on level 3), leaving me wondering if I can be bothered to do it all again on a higer level, doesn't warrant a classic game for me.The engine is the best ever and the bots are gorgeous as is the level design. It just lacks the cutting edge that UT has and I'm still playing that now. I do go back to Quake 3 to make a change to UT but having completed it in one evening I really cant be asked to go all the way back and do it on a harder setting - The lastability just isn't there. Still a great game though - just not as good as Unreal tournement (demo!) HA!"
3,not quite the earth-quake,"Quake 2, even without the 3d card, is possibly the greatest game of all time. Until two years ago, it was turrican on the cbm Amiga, but a couple of letters - id - turned that all upside down. Secrets, skills, intelligent enemies, depth depth depth. And that's what Q3 lacks. Depth. What you get at the beginning is what you'll end up with when you're through. Perhaps you'll be a little better, but the game is too sporadic. Q2 made me lose sleep; Q3 makes me want to sleep. It's a cracker, and better than Q1, but if there's going to be a fourth, let's have two versions. One for the multiplayer freaks, and one for the insomniacs - the 'true' players."
3,Had expected a better game,"The improvements of the graphics are very good, quake engines are always constructed well in sounds and graphics, being a reason of buying a new graphic card most of the time. But this time, in terms of playability, it wasn't quite a succes for Quake. I don't have any complaints about the lack of the single player mode, I play quake multiplayer most of the time. Bots are ok, if you want to play in single. The problem is quake 3 turns out to be a game that rookies have more advantage. It is easier to frag than quake and quake II, and I don't get the same quake pleasure I used to get. It is not a bad game. Even a good one for somebody new to multiplayer first person shooters, but for an experienced player, it is a disillusionment. I'll continue to play quake2 and counterstrike, but when I'm in need of some more blood, it is still a good game."
3,I feel short changed,"This game is great as far as death match play goes. It has great graphics, the game play commentaries are a nice touch but what is missing is the sense of a real challenge.Don't get me wrong. I have been playing this game ever since it was called Wolfenstein 3D. But Id should have put some sort of mission to go along with the great gameplay and graphics. It took me only three days of regular play (about 90minutes a day) to go through the game at the ""hurt me plenty"" level. Versus the weeks spent on Q2 and Half-life.Unless you have cable or DSL or planning to throw many LAN parties, you might feel you are not getting your monies worth."
1,*yawn*,"Old, boring, unoriginal, uninovative, tired, rehashed, been there done that gameplay. Deathmatch is dead people!! The only thing Q3A has going for it is it's 3D engine. This is a poor excuse for a game, but a great display of engine technology."
3,almost there,"Quake III could be an awesome game. I bought it for multiplayer and tried to use it, everytime i get on it says ""connection interrupted"" and freezes up. I have contacted customer service and they weren't to helpful. I wouldn't recomend buying it for multiplayer unlessd you have a cable modem, which aren't available here. Single player doesn't cut it. If you're lucky enough to have a cable modem this is a great game(For anybody out there who can help me with my ""connection interupted"" problem please e-mail me at pm5korn@yahoo.com)"
4,Dont let Quake 3 Areana's age fool you its still alive and kicking,"I have this game and it is very fun with a surprisingly large amount of servers and players playing it even after Quake Live beta which is a free browser based version of the game. While i agree that the single player is not its highlight it is still pretty fun if you need to play away from the internet. Its a fun game you wont be sry.It runs on windows vista I know because I played it about 30 minutes ago.There is a Patch so to make sure you have v1.32 press: ""~"" (with out "" "") after your game loads. look at the bottom cornerIf it doesn't say v1.32 go to id's website search for id software then find the game Quake 3 Arena under Quake click the updates icon and follow directions or just google it."
1,Mind numbingly mindless,"After 3 hours of playing this game my brain went into shut down mode, kinda like from staring at a wall for 3 hours. Belive me this game is just pretty, and if you like killing things mind-lessly then, by all means play this game! The Maximum IQ you can have to enjoy this game is 125. If your IQ is higher than 125, then you will not like it in most cases."
1,Nah,Unreal tournament blows this game to pieces. don't waste your money on a game that has horrible gameplay and low FPS graphix. UT will always be #1.....
3,"Okay, great engine...","...lousy deathmatch appeal. Uninspired, retooled, reused weapons, very un-fun level design, and a shoddy skeletal system for models. That had to beef up the speed so it would be hard to tell. Other than that, for some reason it just is not fun. I do not know what it is, just that it seems the fun had been yanked out. I played Q1 and Q2 religiously, and was chomping at the bit for Q3. It got released, I grabbed it, and was very disappointed. At least other companies put the engine to good use for entertaining games."
3,Save your money -- buy Unreal Tournament instead,"I'm a long time id fan, but in this case they're second best to Epic's Unreal Tournament, which has better variety, better levels, more and better game modes, and better Internet play."
3,My thoughts on Q3 vs. UT,"The graphics on Q3 seems to be slightly (reads very, very slightly; asymptotically so) superior than UT, but that is where the positive comparisons for Q3 stops. UT's map is a lot more creative (including such settings as a moving train, underwater base, and an old wooden ship), and the variety of options other than deathmatch (capture the flag, assult, etc.) puts Q3 to shame. Other than the nice upgrade in sound and graphics, Q3 is just same ole.If you appreciate long lasting playability and can only buy one game in this genre, UT, I submitt, should be your choice."
4,Q3A,"You miss, you die. This is basically the premise of Quake 3:Arena. iD software shows once again who's king in the fps deathmatch arena. There is basically no replacement, no contender for Quake 3:Arena which sets a new standard for the deathmatch experience."
1,Too hard to play.,"Who has this kind of hand-eye coordination? This game moves way to fast for anyone aside from the average twelve year old to be good at it. I don't like games I have to break a sweat to play. This game is total crap, tame it down some and it would be good."
1,unfortunately 0 stars was not an option,"This game should be named Arena Gladiators from the makers of Quake II. This game has absolutely nothing in common with the Doom/Quake family, with the exception of the outstanding graphics. Valve and the writers of the next Half-Life mission pack should not worry. The game is premised upon the idea that you want to play deathmatch games."
1,"Quake III - poor successor to Quake 2, Doom, etc","What a waste of money! After enjoying the battles in Wolfenstein, Doom, Doom 2, Quake and Quake 2, I was sure that Quake III would blow them all away. I was tragically wrong. It is just a single person shooter against very boring bots. There is no exploration, no secret places, no interesting critters, no advancing from level to level, no save and no resume. Maybe if you're in to fragging anonymous spotty boys via the Internet it might have some attraction but I'm not so it didn't. It's utterly devoid of imagination. ID software will not get any more of my dollars. Try the demo before you put down real cash for this hollow shell of a so-called game."
5,I'm speechless...,"This game is soooooo coooool! I love this game! I love the graphics, characters, weapons, deathmatch, ALL! There's almost nothing to complain about this game! Forget UT, Quake is the best! IDsoftware is the best! I love all the Quake series! And I also enjoyed doom :)"
5,I love this game and idsoftware,"At first, UT seemed a better game than this one, but as the time passed, this game surely is better. The graphics are outstanding, Deathmatch play is so fun! Well, the level designs are beautiful, but not original or unique as UT, Weapons are okay, but also not original too. Anyways, I love this game, and I enjoyed every game from Id since doom..."
2,Not Great,"Quake 3 is absolutely no comparison to Unreal Tournament, sure the graphics in Quake 3 are great and sounds good to. Overall I would say that Unreal Tournament is a much better game than Quake 3."
4,Q3A works with Voodoos (3dfx),"I have no idea what Santa Clause is talking about.Q3A does use OpenGL but it works with Voodoo's (1,2,3). I know because I have run the demo on my Voodoo2. It works fine.UT is better out of the box and if you are a newbie. Q3A is better for twitch-action."
3,Star Trek: Hidden Evil - Rotten Graphics,"The game seriously lacks in graphics, comparible maybe to the graphics in the older Star Trek games like Judgement Rites, etc. I did however like the story line, and it was fairly easy to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a true Trek fan."
2,Graphics are the only saving grace...,"Definitely not worthy of buying. The graphics and general design are the only thing that save this game from 1 star. It had a lot of potential but the story is poorly developed, the game play is waaaay to easy, and the ending is just the pits. Great idea, nice graphics, bad game."
3,Good try but falls short..,"I am a Star Trek fan. I admit it. And I look forward to interactive games about Star Trek. However, most releases are not very good (Starfleet Command, Starship Creator to name a few) and it makes we wonder if we are finally going to get a great Star Trek game. Hidden Evil is a good attempt, but has many faults. There is no mouse or joystick support. The game is pretty easy and way too short. And for the best ""cut scenes,"" you have to install the complete game on the hard drive. To say things in it's favor, the graphics are good (I only tested the 3DFx version,) the sound and music are well done, and the game approaches greatness several times, but falls flat. If you are a Star Trek fan and like to collect the software titles, I would recommend this, but don't expect too much. I give this title a ""C."""
2,Good Star Trek - Poor Game,"Hidden Evil is a great game plot in search of a real game. Activison did a very good job capturing the feel of the Star Trak genre. The graphics and sound quality are quite good. However, as a game Hidden Evil falls woefully short of the mark. The puzzles are not challenging. The overall enviroment is very two dimensional despite ustilizing true 3-D for generating the main characters. You can't fall off a bridge even if you try. But the worst part is the keyboard-only control. It is extremely cumbersome and remeniscent of the late 1980's, when PC adventure games were just crawling out of the ""text-only"" primordeal soup. In fact, much of the game's combat difficulty comes from the interface instead of the opponents.It's a shame such a good concept was wasted by apparent laziness on the part of Activision."
2,"Good Game for Trekkies, Bad Game for Gamers","This game has some great graphics and a good story to it. But the controls in the game are very hard. And the story is WAY too short. (2-5 hours for most people to complete it). This game also has almost no replay value in it.So basically, if you are a diehard trekkie, and you are willing to fork over $30 for 10 hours max of playing time, then this game is for you. However, if you are a gamer to any degree, you'll probably find this game a boring experience."
4,Hidden Evil is a fun follow-up to Insurrection.,"Although the puzzles are simplistic and easy to solve, graphics and sounds are out of this world. Furthermore, the actual story line is quite fascinating if you're a Star Trek afficionado. The role playing is superb, a style which I have not seen since the old King's Quest adventure series. Control is totally keyboard based, which, I feel, increases the level of enjoyment since you're not just clicking around. YOU control the game. It's great fun. I just wish you could increase the difficulty settings. Email me if you'd like to discuss this review, Star Trek, or computer games in general. Masterific@aol.com"
4,A great primer for spiritual memoir writing...,"This is an excellent guide for anyone who is interested in writing a spiritual memoir or any memoir where he or she is sharing his or her journey through a period in their life where they were searching for meaning whether it involved religion, God, a higher being or spirituality from within. The writer did a great job organizing the chapters to guide every aspect of the process. If you are thinking of writing a spiritual memoir, absolutely start here."
3,Smaller than anticipated,"This is a very small and quite stiff pillow for the singing bowl. It works fine, I was just expecting something a bit larger and more fluid. The colors are very vibrant and quality fabric is used. The craftmanship is well done as well - just not what I was expecting."
1,yuck,"boring, poorly written, more of a ""how to"". don't recommend. Not at all what I was expecting whenI heard about it."
5,Book of the Year Award,The Bogeyman: Stalking and its Aftermath' has just wonFirst Place in the 2003 Foreword Magazine's Book of theYear Awards in the True Crime category. She won the Gold.This book is a must read. Also see Toxic Attention: A manual on stalking and how to stay safe.
1,Horrible stuff!! Tastes like spearmint gum!!,Horrible stuff!! Tastes like spearmint gum!!Buy the Monin plain sugar syrup instead and use fresh limes and mint!!
2,Hard to see what your peeling...like maybe your finger,"I'm glad that the other reviewers are loving this peeler, but I was so disappointed. When you're using it, you can't really see where the blade meets the food. For me it made it terribly difficult to peel anything without missing parts. I was also terrified that I would peel off part of my finger along with the skin of whatever fruit I was holding. I usually like the Chef'n products, but I threw this on in the trash."
1,Ouch,It cuts really well; from vegetables to your fingers! I have a chunk of skin missing from our left index finger because it is hard to control. The guard maks it hard to see the hand holding the vegetable. End result...a nice slice taken out of the side of my knukle!
3,Great case but not what they used to be,These cases have been the industry standard case for Fender guitars for decades. This one exhibits the lowest quality standards yet. Mine arrived scratched up; but the locks were the most disturbing. They don't close as firmly as my older Fender cases of this same manufacture. The lock does not squarely align together. It holds well enough; but does not inspire faith as the older examples do. Sad to say I am not delighted with this case.
5,Good introduction,"This is a good introduction to what Islam is, and is very logical and clear. I highly recomend this for anyone who wants to learn more about Islam."
5,"Ah, the memories...","What a great collection! Too bad its ballad counterpart ""Ballady"" doesn't quite live up to the billing. This album contains most of their fast songs plus two new tracks: a new version of Hamlet and the excellent Smycz which alone is worth the price of admission. The most compelling reason to own this is the re-mastering, which keeps the early recordings (Boskie Buenos, Szare Miraze, etc) from sounding like they were recorded in the basement--the drums benefit in particular, even though they still sound somewhat thin. This music will give you an adrenaline rush. Great for driving at high speeds."
1,Not properly described,"I have a hard copy version of this book, with delightful illustrations in color and I cherish it and rate it as a 5 star piece of literature. When I received this paperback version, however, with its black and white illustrations, I felt totally cheated. Don't be fooled. The product is not properly priced or represented."
3,Paperback,"We absolutely adore Margaret Wise Brown so naturally scooped this book up when we saw it. However, we were quite disappointed that we paid $16.99 for a paperback that is not very substantial at all, and the colors within the book are rather dull. We love the poems but were not pleased with the printing, colors, or binding. I'm glad to see that the price has dropped."
3,la perla...,I used to wear this fragrance very long time ago when I was younger....it seems now too strong for me....
3,"Don't be fooled by the word ""remastered"".","I was shocked when I saw that this album was finally available on CD. Honestly, I never thought I'd see the day that would happen. It is a very obscure title. My warning to those that are about to purchase this CD however, is not to get your hopes up on perfect sound quality. This CD was definitely remastered from a record (LP) and the b-sides from 45's. Granted, they did a good job cleaning it up. But still, from a record? I had heard in the past that the band was not allowed access to the original master tapes for whatever reason. I guess it's still true. It is completey ridiculous that they weren't allowed to use their own master tapes. There must be a legal issue with the old record company or something. Very strange."
5,A new wave gem finally on CD--with the Friday the 13th Part 5 track!!!,"A gem of synth/guitar new wave dance music, Pseudo Echo's first album is possibly better than their follow up, which contained the hit cover of ""funkytown"". Ironically, several of these songs were rerecorded (or maybe just remixed) for inclusion on the second album. But the original tracks are just perfect, and great 80s treasures for fans of Flock of Seagulls, Berlin, etc. And finally, here on CD is the track ""His Eyes"", used in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning, when the punk chick is listening to her headphones before getting smeared by Jason."
3,Sound Quality Issues,"I'm afraid what John Doe says is correct. It definitely sounds like it was not transferred from the masters. They cleaned it up fairly well, but it's obvious upon first listen...."
5,Great Rev War book for kids,"Beautifully illustrated book on Revolutionary War that helps explain the war by comparing George Washington and King George III. Accurate information, clearly expressed in readable prose with a good story line. Humorous and very colorful artwork is very appealing. My grandsons, ages 8 and 10, loved it, and so did I. Highly recommend this book, especially if your children are turned off by ""history."""
5,IT IS THE REVOULUTION OF GEORGE VS. GEORGE!,Wannna learn about history? Than this is your type of book. See the revoulution from our side and Britain's side. Great for any ages.
1,One of the worst movies of all time,"This has to be one of the worst movies. First of all on the box it says its digitally remastered. Its straight off video. This is readily apparent right when the movie starts and you see the house look on the bottom you see a bad tracking off a vcr. Give me a break. Secondly the quiz on there is a joke the chances of someone spotting the license plate off the car as one of the questions asks is absurd. Worst of all the actors are constantly out of focus and out of frame. I would say about 30% of the movie consists of people being out of frame and its just a empty frame with a wall for about 10 seconds. You will hear people talking but its a wall. The scene transitions are horrible. For example a guy puts on his glasses and it gets all blurry. Wouldnt it be the opposite? Oh yeah and I hate to spoil it but thats not really Bruce Lee, its Bruce Li......"
4,Image of Bruce Lee/Fists of Bruce Lee,"I thought this DVD was great. It was another documentary type of video, but for a Bruce Lee fan anything is good. The price is also a great deal. So for anyone that is a die-hard Bruce Lee fan, run out and pick this up right away."
3,100 yrs. of OZ,For me the small print was difficult so I feel young children will kind of skip over the info imparted regarding all the OZ info that I hadn't known about. Also the font used for the major headings in places was terrible - very hard to read. Those were the only complaints I had but I bought it to encourage my 11 year old granddaughter to enjoy reading - this may lack for that purpose and she'll just skip over looking at the pictures.100 Years of Oz: A Century of Classic Images
1,Not for the iMac,"After installing the Shanghai software on my iMac, I was unable to get the game to play. I have no trouble with the games software I buy from the stores, so I don't know why this one wouldn't work. The software in the stores is also cheaper. I was very unhappy with this product."
1,Needs to be better constructed,"A good idea, but didn't actually stand up to use (and abuse) by my horse. Obviously horses are not going to like something on their muzzle and work to pull it off, which he did - many times. I understand the need for this to be ""breakaway"" but the stitching for the straps holding it to the halter snapped before the velcro let loose... If the halter is supposed to be the ""breakaway"" feature, then you don't need the muzzle to also be IMHO. Needless to say it lasted maybe one week and then was held to the halter by zip ties for another couple at most. To me, this was a complete waste of money."
3,needs replacement aluminum mouth pieces,"Excellent for windsucking/cribbers! Much lighter than the metal muzzles and therefore more comfortable for those of us with horses obsessed with wind sucking or cribbing. Easy to attach to halter, and it stays on with the velcro. My previous experience was with the metal muzzle, which was horrifically heavy and the clasps did not stop my horse from trying to rub it off on the fenceline :(My only complaint is that they do not offer replacement aluminum mouth pieces. My obsessive horse has gone through (2) of them so far by rubbing the aluminum until it broke. Hence replacing the whole thing.Other than that, I will continue to use as it's light, comfortable, and easy to clean."
2,Missing Too Much Information,"Within 5 minutes of trying to map my first route, I have already discovered a bridge that is missing from the map. This bridge was present in other versions of the program and I was hoping the data in the new version would be better than the old, not worse!"
3,not quite up to my expectations,"Although pretty good for automobile use, I find it's not quite accurate to trust for backcountry hiking. almost identical to their ""gazeteer"" books."
4,Its Not That Bad,"I bought this product after looking at Topo! and Microsoft Streets which I think it is signifcantly better than. I use it specifically for creating route maps with directions for long distance road cycling as I train people for charity rides. There are some limitations in the data sets, I found a few missing bike paths and such like, but the fact that you can draw these on as routable paths is great. You can't do this with Microsoft. I also love the fact that you get profiles and elevations etc.Better printing options would be nice, but for road cycling - this is a great product."
5,Works for Me,I bought this software to plan bicycle routes and produce grade profiles. It does this well and was easy to learn. I run it on a year old laptop computer and the performance is satisfactory.
1,Hikers - Look Elsewhere,"I bought this software for producing detail maps and profiles for hiking. In short, I'm very dissapointed and have uninstalled the app. Why?- the maps are outdated and inaccurate, many (well established) trails are missing or miss-routed.- the software is unstable resulting in multiple crashes requiring TaskMan kills (try exporting a profile as a jpeg).- the UI is awful. Simple tasks require you to hunt through multiple screens with poor (if any) results.- the search functionality is next to useless. Try finding a lake by name in your local area...- the on screen nav is cumbersome at best, resulting in magnification or pans that confound and frustrate. Where's the undo?I've written Windows apps since the early 80's (Win v1.03). This one's what we call a dog."
1,For only the most advanced and patient users....,"I bought this product to use with my Garmin etrex GPS unit. The website claims it is compatable, but it turns out it is not. I was unable to successfully navigate or use more than about 10% of the features, and I consider myself a moderate to advanced user. Another negitive thing about this program is the fact it comes with NO instruction manual! Tech support is a long distance call, available only during very limited hours. Finally, navigating around any map requires constant reloading which takes forever. I have a $3500 computer,as fast as they currently make them and I found myself waiting for images to load constantly. Do yourself a favor and try another program."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I would say I have average computer skills. I cannot make this program work as advertised. It is extreemly hard to find, view or print what you want. It is a waste of my time and my money. Save your self the trouble, do not buy this program."
5,Keeps getting better and better,"This is the best No-No's CD so far. They keep getting more refined and complex in sound - the lead vocals spread across a wide variety of tones, which complement the music behind it very well. Check out the cool base tones and wicked guitar. This band is also great live - highly recommended."
4,A good collection,"I enjoyed some of the stories better than others in this collection, but I suppose that is to be expected. Having said that, I enjoyed the book even if it was just to get another taste of the Drakas.It is my fervent hope that Stirling continues to write about these intruiging people."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I had really given up on finding any new Draka material, so you can imagine my delight in finding this book tucked away in a back corner of a mall bookstore. My delight diminished a bit when I saw that the book is an anthology, but I bought it anyway after reviewing the list of contributors.As I read through the book, I was pleasantly surprised to find no real weak stories and some very good ones. Unlike a previous reviewer, I found the earlier stories much stronger than the later ones (although I agree with his statement that the trans-dimensional travel sub-genre is ""hopelessly tired""). As a big fan of George McDonald Fraser's ""Flashman"" series, I was especially delighted by Jane Lindskold's contribution.Anthologies tend to be ""dangerous"" purchases, but based on the results of this first effort I would definitely be interested in another volume."
3,The fruit of idle curiosity,"As much as I was entranced by the Domination (see my review for that book), Drakas! failed to satisfy my hunger for new Draka-reality stories. Don't get me wrong, the stories were entertaining, which should have been expected considering the credentials of the contributing authors. However, none of them came close to the gripping narrative of the original trilogy, especially the Stirling's matter-of-fact descriptions of the Domination's social order, which gave it such bone-chilling feeling of legitimate reality. In some instances, it appeared that the contributors simply did not take time to go deeper into the mindset of Homo Drakensis and the way it clashed with what we consider reality..."
3,"Good, but no soul...","Although the individual tales of 'Drakas!' had potential, they simply weren't long enough to let us become familiar with the characters and plots, and how much we truly love to hate the Draka as individuals and as a culture, since they don't exactly qualify as people in the strictest sense of the word. There were many stories, but there were be too many 'draka in our world' tales, all regarding Gwendolyn Ingolfsson (see/read Drakon) and small moves of her plans. Without giving it away, the last tale seemed overly vague and took several re-reads regarding a Samothracian battle.A decent book overall, but knowing what the other books were about, I probably won't read 'Drakas!' again."
4,Good Book,"I found the book to be an insightful look into Italian Colonialism in Eritrea. However Tekeste does little if any effort to hide his bias against Eritrean Independence, and Nationalism. If choosing this book keep in mind to read just the facts and leave his many opinions alone."
4,"Brilliant, fun, and educational","I absolutely loved this book! I knew little about Quantum mechanics before reading this, and now I have a good understanding of the concepts covered in this book. I learned something, but I also had a great time reading the story.He develops some brilliant ideas, including neural mods that allow you to ""program"" your brain and run ""apps"" and tools to control your body, your thought processes, your emotions, etc.I didn't like that it was set in New Hong Kong, though. The Chinese names really ran together and made it harder for me to visualize the characters, especially considering that he is an Australian writer writing for an English-speaking audience.The ending really left me pondering. I don't think that I would have chosen that particular ending, but it is satisfying and left me wanting for more!"
3,existential angst disguised as a novel,"It was OK. Lots of nice ideas I wish had been explored more. A procedural or detective story that actually remained a detective story, and still focused on the primed state, the mods, etc. could have been really good. The doublethink of the loyalty mod, and the choice of Karen were good. But it was dragged down for me by pages and pages of existential angst over quantum philosophy. Which seemed unnecessary, since there was already so much room for self-examination in the rest of the set-up, that there was no need to drag in infinite improbability drives to move the story."
4,"In many ways, a brilliant novel","Every time I read Greg Egan, I am so impressed by the ideas. Some of the revelations, the images of some of the quantum phenomenon, the extention to known science can be truly mind-blowing.The writing, while ok, can sometimes be dull, especially to someone who hasn't read lots of popular science books about quantum mechnics. Egan is often talking about ideas that intrigue him, and he has many discussions between characters who just go off on many philosophical tangents that don't necessarily forward the story.Egan always does this in his novels, and Quarantine is one of his least distracting.There were at least two times that I thought that book was pure genius and was simply in awe of the ideas and how they were discussed and used in the story.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who already is a fan of Greg Egan or any other reader who want to be challenged and doesn't mind putting up with some of the author's indulgences."
4,Lutheranism,"Nobody has mentioned this in the reviews I've read so I will: When many of the novel's characters are drugged into being loyal to a corporation they used to hate, they escape the need to stay loyal to the corporation by inventing ... The Protestant Reformation!That is, they convince themselves that the ""real"" corporation (or church) is an individual ideal, and not the mere organization they've been drugged into being loyal to. This is precisely the ""trick"" the original Protestants, like Luther, used to escape the emotional domination of the Catholic church.There's no doubt Egan intended this, and it makes QUARANTINE one of his best novels. It's not all science fiction, and the philosophy is as up to date as a course in modern religion.Just thought I'd mention it."
2,A quantum castastrophe indeed,"I was bored silly by this book, which speculates on ways the human mind may be able to manipulate quantum mechanics. While the beginning of the book was engrossing -- with a well-drawn main character, and the beginning of a good, futuristic mystery plot -- the story soon bogs down. The main character is captured, forced into the service of a faceless corporation that is doing quantum research, and begins to learn how to mentally manipulate subatomic particles. Over half the book is taken up with discussions of the relationship between ""choice"" and ""being."" These are, unfortunately, never very interesting. The main character keeps speculating, in an endless soliloquy, on what he is doing, why he's doing it, and what it really means. By the time the I reached the end of the book, I had no sympathy for any of the characters, no interest in the story's outcome, and no desire to read anything else by Egan."
2,"Pointless technology, pointless ending","This book is full of technobabble for technobabble's sake; separate the wheat from the chaff and you're left with a mediocre short story with an unsatisfying ending. I admit that 90 pages into it there are a host of potentially promising possibilities. But to borrow the author's deus, he deftly manages to ""collapse"" the many possible outcomes into the least satisfying, least meaningful ""reality"". I only hope that of all the alternate universe me's out there, I'm the only one that read this through to the end and that all the others spent their time doing more enjoyable tasks."
1,I found this story very frustrating.,"The beginning was very fasinating, and introduced us to the world of nano-technologies. I started looking forward to the mystery of finding a missing woman and then became very disapointed as the story went off in other tangents that confused me greatly. Other characters were glimpsed for short stays but their place in the story was never fulfilled. The end of the story just left me glad that I did not have another page to turn. The story left me empty and not wanting more."
1,Simply horrible,"The premise of this book was exciting: a bubble suddenly surrounds the solar system, blocking out the stars. Is it aliens, a black hole, God ? After the first couple of interesting chapters, the book changes directions and becomes a dreadful technomystery. The are consortiums and convoluted plans within plans. I stopped reading about half way through because I couldn't stand it anymore. I did thumb to the back to see what the cause of the bubble was and it was explained in one short throw-away paragraph.The writing here is simply terrible. It is of the quality you would expect from a high school writing fair honorable mention."
3,"Interesting, but (be careful some spoiling here!!)","I found the ideas behind the book very interesting however I think that there are a few flaws in the hypothesis. Being an engineer I usually like this topics, but This wasn't quite the case. I found it a bit slow, many useless descriptions of advanced technologies which turn to be a bit boring. Referring to ""quantum theory"" I think there is big leap (I would say quantum leap :-)in taking quantum theory from an atomic ""size"" to a cosmic dimensions.Anyway as I said interesting ideas.Update 23-04-2007Reading more about the multiverse issue It seems that many great scientifics like S. Hawking among others, think possible the theory of many universes opening at same time. Well considering that some of the previous objection wouldn't apply any longer."
3,HITTING THE BOOKS - HARD!,"I picked this book at random, just felt I would give it a try. I enjoyed the novel, but did not like the lecture. Be warned... long winded explainations into theory and often dry science really bring this book down. The books characters are often forced by the author to repeat (and repeat again) the same details, often using the same exact dialouge from a pervious chapter to cover what has already been covered at least ten times... slow and dull, but does pick up towards the end. Worth hanging in there... or skimming. Give it a try... just be warned."
3,Birds didn't go for it but the possums loved it.,"Well the title pretty much says it all. The birds took a few nibbles out of these and the possums devoured them. I thought they smelled a little stale but who knows? Regardless, my cats had fun watching whatever it was that would eat them."
1,So bad the birds won't touch it...,"I use a mix of seed and suet with my birdfeeders.With this particular product, the birds would not touch it.It was very odd so I tried more than half the cakes in the case but the birds would fly up to it and then immediately leave.I do not recommend this product."
5,The Customer Lifetime Value approach to business strategy,"""Managing Customers..."" does a wonderful job of providing a holistic approach to customer lifetime value (CLV).Founded on the principle of viewing customers as assets, the book provides a super-efficient, highly-impactful read on transforming the CLV principle into actionable tactics in key aspects of business - fusing marketing, finance, and organizational structure into a well-aligned strategy for enabling a business to maximize the value it creates & derives from customers. Truly a must read for students of business.On a side note - just wanted to express how impressed I have been with all of The Wharton School books that I have read to date - they are truly some of the finest business books available.-Dougwww.mindofmarketing.net"
3,"Good Quality, Poor Quantity","The substance of the information presented was genuinely useful knowledge. The first 2 or 3 chapters really give a good analysis of the value of a customer. The extensive examples that follow are merely verbose repetitions of the previously presented (and actually well supported) concepts. Sadly there is not a Harvard Business Review for this book, but there should be, to cut down on absorbtion time. Not a waste of money, but perhaps time."
4,About the IQ of the person that created this web page....,".....anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature would know the difference between a 15"" woofer (what the speaker has) and a 15"" SUB-woofer (what the moron put in the title of the item)."
5,A must have for cruising Belize,Just checked here for the availability of this guide and was suprized to see no review. Having recently returned from cruising with friends in Belize I can say that this guide is often the only chart info available inside the reef. If you intend to cruise Belize obtain all available charts of course but be sure to get this book. Capt. Rauscher has obviously spent countless hours charting Belizean waters and although they are really no more than sketches (and do not purport to be more) they are invaluable for piloting within the 10 fath. curve. The guide also includes sailing directions and commentary on the various destinations.
5,Great Cruising guide,Necessary guide for trip planning to the Region. One of few reliable guides for this area of the west Caribbean.
2,Same old book--new cover,"I just got an old edition of this book. And, after looking at it and comparing it to the new edition, I would suggest buying an old edition--if you can find one. Why? Well, basically the new edition is a re-hash of the old with the same layout plans, photos and text. There are few changes--enough to merit it the ""new edition"" title--but I was disappointed with the new version since there was so much hype around this book and it did not deliver. Next time they update, they should include more plans, more examples/pictures of gardens, and more valuable info."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"Although does cover some of the material I was hoping for, it seems to mainly deal with landscaping (duh, read the title guy), I was hoping for a book that dealt more with native plants, covering more plants, more photos, less to do with landscaping, more to do with identification. Maybe that book exists somewhere."
2,Title,"The sound is what I expected early within the album which was fine to me...but as the album passed I caught myself losing interest within the sound, I was underwhelmed and noticed that I was somewhat lost by the lack of ferocity in some of the songs...What first attracted me to their sound was the raw feedback but this release is kind of like going to a show expecting to mosh but notice that everyone's just ""hardcore"" dancing like idiots..."
5,New and Improved,"While so many enjoyed the pure chaos that was ""Everything is Alive, Everything is Breathing, Nothing is dead and Nothing is Bleeding""; The Chariot released a smoother second album. This is not to say it is less hardcore, however the sound is a bit more pleasant. Theyre really good, this albums great. Give it a listen"
5,Great resource,Very good book to have as a reference if you are considering a restoration. A must have for the 356 owner.
1,"great movies, terrible dvd",The Last Man On Earth is a great sci-fi film. George Romero probably saw this movie before he made Night Of The Living Dead. But the quality of this DVD is terrible! I also own this film on VHS and the quality is vastly superior! I believe this is now a public domain film and the DVD maker simply used the first available (worn out) print found. Get the video. Pass on this DVD.
2,paid under five bucks,"They just don't hold up all that well. Last Man... is better than the other, although that's not saying much.Also, you can see where George Romero borrowed heavily for his Night of the Living Dead flicks.I must add: Richard Matheson is a highly respected genre writer. Besides writing LAST MAN ON EARTH (among other books and screenplays) He's the guy who wrote the excellent DUEL,starring Dennis Weaver. Get it, if you've never seen it.I really don't blame him or the late Vincent Price for the way LAST MAN... turned out. It's really not a bad flick...and yet you can't help feeling that it should have turned out far better, that the material was there...Hey, if you're about ten years old...you might get a real kick out of it."
3,good movies but shotty capturing,"I bought this because I believed it was a good deal. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for. The person that captured the film has a section of the movie screen missing. I was rather disappointed. I would recomend buying the House on Haunted Hill separately for a little more money, it's quality is nice. But if you don't mind the missing part of the screen and you like Vincent Price movies then buy this rendition. The DVD case is also quite unique and interesting."
2,Content - Great . Production Quality of DVD - Garbage,"As a Price fan, I had to get these two classics. When the DVD arrived I anxiously poped it out of it's case, put it in the DVD player, and hit the play button. The sound was scratchy, there was an annoying white glow in the lower right corner of the screen, and the original film the DVD was produced from must have been used as a cat scratching post. I swear that the DVD was made from a video tape shot in a cinema off the moviue screen - it's that ad. At first I thought this was as good as the quality got for this movie. Then I saw it on the SciFi Channel - the quality was excellent, sound was perfect, etc.So if you want it for the movies, it's OK. As for quality, it's the WORST DVD I have seen to date - and I own over 150!"
3,Worst Print on Earth!,"The quality of House on Haunted Hill is good. However, The print of The Last Man on Earth is so bad I can't even find the words to explain it clearly. Anyway, since it's the only DVD of The Last Man on Earth available for sale, there is really no choice if you want the movie.For the price, this disc is worth getting for House on Haunted Hill if for nothing else. As I've mentioned, the quality of House on Haunted Hill is quite good. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum on one disc!"
5,Last Man On Earth!,"I bought this dvd for its Vincent Price/House on Haunted Hill aspect. I was VERY impressed with Last Man On Earth. It's a sci-fi horror classic that I never get sick of watching. To be fair, the dvd transfer is pretty bad and grainy, but it's a cheap dvd. I cannot say enough about Last Man on Earth, it's the best dvd I've bought in months."
5,"Powerful lyrics, Powerful music","By far, this is one of the greatest albums ever recorded. I've let many people listen to my copy of this and I have not found anyone that does not love it. Whether it be the lyrics, the music, or just the pure thoughts relayed - there is something for everyone (and in most cases, all of it is for everyone). There are few albums that are this encouraging to people and, to me, I feel that finding this CD is a complete blessing. It has kept me going when I have been down. Truly, this is an inspired work by our Creator."
1,hate it!,"This product it is just a waste of money! For one it keeps falling into the bath tub, because it is too heavy for the type of suction, and also because kids do want to play with it and it just keeps falling, you would just have to hold it the entire time.Two, the bubble maker does not blow, but water and every now and then it shoots a bubble. And three the rest of the toy it is just pointless. So believe me when I tell you this is a wate of money. Mine is some where under the sink cabinets."
5,Excellent Book,This book covers all of the bases and is really helpful for getting ready for that big test. Oh yeah Diana Buckner is cool too!
3,not as good as the Herb Pharm brand,"This brand helped me get to sleep but I had to take a lot more of it than the Herb Pharm brand. I'm not sure of the science behind the Herb Ratio, but maybe that's the reason. Aonther thing that bugged me was that the dropper would't get very full. Instead of just going back for a second droperfull, I had to go back several times. It really wasn't a big deal at all, but it was just slightly annoying. I didn't dock it any stars for that. I gave it three stars simply because I had to use more of it than the other stuff. I bought a bottle that was twice the size of the other brand so that it would last longer, but it really didn't since I had to use more. No real money saved here."
3,Don't get package deal,"I didn't read about the offer well enough, and bought the package deal of three books. The two smaller books are included in the larger one, so why make it a package deal? The large book is very informative and well worth the read. JUST buy the Complete ACOA Sourcebook."
4,Nice,"Easy read, good info about the issues facing ACOAs, advice for solving these issues seems like it was quickly made up, fairly cheesy."
3,Compilation of older works,"The material is relevant, but this book is essentially a compilation of the author's older works (which I found at my local library).I decided on 3-stars (vs 2) because if you're considering this book for personal use, it is a good start -- assuming you'd prefer to avoid the library."
2,Repetitive,"This book is really repetitive. It is basically the same information but slightly altered for each of the three sections (Home, Work, Love). I would suggest going to the library and skimming books in this subject to ensure that they are consistent with your ideological point of view and include alot of statistics and examples before you buy it. But then again, there are not many authors that write about adult children of alcoholics so if you have money to burn supporting them is good, too."
5,Adult Children of Alcoholics,This is really a good book with lots of good information. It is very easy to read and helpful as a self help book.
3,Hit and miss,"I have an autistic 5 year old who will not sleep. He will stay up for hours and hours screaming while you hold him in bed. Fun times, I tell you!! Anyway, I bought some $6 brand from shop n save- wonderful. Originally bought one from Vitamin Shoppe - no idea on the brand either. But worked wonderful. This brand? He LOVES to eat. The others he would end up chewing instead of swallowing and they are gross. I tried one of these and it's like a nasty pina colada taste.. but he likes them so whatever. Long story short, some days he takes it - he goes to sleep, some days he takes it - he's up until 2 am.."
3,Not sure,I'm not sure if this works or not. Most times I get a good night's rest after taking it but there have been some times that I have not. There have also been several nights where I don't take it at all and I get a good night's rest.There could be other factors that are determining when I do and when I don't have a rough night sleeping that has nothing to do with the Melatonin.
2,"binding broken first time I opened the book, poor quality","Such a nice looking hardcover book, but then I opened up the front cover and the binding was already broken, I don't know if all the books are this poor of quality or if I just got unlucky. Buyer beware."
4,In the Beginning - The Hydroplate Theory,"In this book Dr. Walt Brown is to be commended for presenting his thoughts and ideas regarding his hydroplate theory. Brown discusses the scientific case for creation and presents 127 conclusions based upon about a dozen categories of evidence along with references. He then answers many of the frequently asked questions and some of the mysteries involved in this subject matter. He then gets into the meat of his hydroplate theory and discusses the fit of the continents, his methodology, and presents a working hypothesis. Dr. Brown provides many charts and diagrams that really enhance what he is talking about. Footnotes are also provided and are very helpful. One recommendation would be to include an index at the end of book. Perhaps he has done this in his later editions. I have the fifth edition which is dated 1989."
4,"Good info, but faulty binding","My daughter used this book for a research paper. It was an excellent resource, but upon opening it for the first time the cover separated from the book completely. Otherwise the book was excellent."
5,Filled of amazing truth,"This book has answered my longest unanswered questions of the global flood and has strengthened my knowledge in how to answer questions to those that doubt the ""story"" of Noah's ark and the great flood."
2,Disappointed,"Sorry, but I was disappointed w/the book --- might just be me --but it seemed to be written way over the heads of the normal person just wanting to read in simple terms--- about the evidence for creation. Seemed like a college textbook to me. I have to admit--I didn't check it out very well before ordering -- there might be information out there that would have helped me determine that it wouldn't be the book I was looking for --- But Thank You Amazon for allowing me to return it without any hassle. I appreciate that a lot. Most of the time I am happy w/my orders - but it is nice to know when I'm not -- there is good return service."
2,Observations falsify Dr. Brown's theory,"As a layperson interested in geology and evolution, I enjoy reading texts from a variety of authors. Dr. Brown's book is quite entertaining but lacks any real merit. Even as a layperson, I have easily refuted many of Dr. Brown's main premises. He claims that the fossils found in the geologic column were sorted, not by evolution and great amounts of time, but by the process of liquefaction. However, how is it possible for trace fossils and surface features such as footprints, dessication cracks, burrows, rainprints, etc, etc to be formed in the middle of the geologic column if the entire column's materials were sort, unconsolidated materials during the sorting caused by liquefaction? I have asked Dr. Brown these very questions over the phone and via e-mail many times and have had no response. Hmmm."
5,Treasure trove of relevant and understandable science,"I earned a Ph.D. in Physics, taught college for 34 years, and am Professor of Physics, Emeritus. I've never seen a book with more interesting and well-presented science, dealing with earth, ocean, atmosphere, outer space objects; chemical, physical, and biological processes; scientific and statistical methods; and common sense. Other reviews have dealt with science-religion interface subjects (I am a man of faith, though). I can open to any page and see something I want to read.Dr. Brown's Engineering Ph.D. is from M.I.T. 'Nuff said about his mind.The book I got from Amazon is an attractive hardback of high quality."
5,Unable To Put It Down!,"As an educator of skulls full of grey mush it is a wonderful find. It's layout, content and research makes it invaluable as a tool for the truth. Doug DoddPastor - Berean Bible ChurchEdgewater, Florida"
1,Unscientific,"Before I start I must emphasize that I am not a strict evolutionest (To me Darwin's theory remains just a theory) and I am not exactly against creationism. I have only a limited scientific background other than that in my field (computers) but even someone as unlearned as me could spot the horrondous mistakes and false claims the author proposes as 'proof' and 'evidence'. I am surprised at how many debunked claims and unscientific conclusions can be found in this book, and the heavy use of pseudo science, sensationlism and jumping to concluisons is plain unscientific. There is too many to mention here, but using undocumented *monster sightings* has to be one of the worst. As I laboured through the book I got the unshakeable feeling that the authour just crammed every bit of creationist argument (false, debunked or otherwise) just to fill up his book. Unsuprisingly, this book reads more like propganda than a true scientific book."
1,There's only one good thing about this book...,"...and that's the title. I can only hope that people looking for this book will, after doing a title search, come across Brian Fagan and Christopher DeCorse's In the Beginning: an Introduction to Archaeology. By doing so, they might learn what archaeology is all about and how it works. They might also learn about the many methods of dating artifacts and objects, a clearly misunderstood area of this debate. Stratigraphy, dendrochronology, obsidian hydration, carbon-14, potassium-argon, thermoluminescence, fission track, uranium series, electronic spin resonance, and archaeomagnetic dating, just to name a few of the absolute dating methods. Brown clearly has an agenda he is furthering by using data in very manipulative ways. It saddens me that he does this, and that many people are drawn in by this."
5,"A ""must have"" book","This content of this book is just one reason evolutionists will not debate creationists. All the evidence points to a young earth, even though that's not what we are taught. This is a logical, reasonable, comprehensive look at creation with a hard, defendable consideration of evidence (1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics, Law of Probability, etc.). Excellent for reference. Well organized."
5,Let the evidence speak !,The most comprehensive case for creation and the flood to date. Puts William Jennings Bryan to shame! A work this extensive BEGS a response from any professing evolutionist. Silence is no defense!
5,In The Beginning: Compeelling Evidence for Creation & the FloodThis Text,"This text is truly Outstanding. It should be in every HighschoolScience classroom. The Study Guide that is available on the internetis also a great guide through the material. The author has madwa direct Offer to a written debate with any one, using pure science.Mention of Religion is not allowed.This, from a former highschool Biology Teacher."
4,Great for OS X,"If you've read my Unreal Tournament review, you know that I REALLY love UT. However, I finally got a reason to buy Quake III Arena, it runs on OS X. BEAUTIFULLY. It is still more cartoony than UT, and is harder to control (It goes WAY too fast to be believed) but it runs on OS X. even on my little iMac. You just have to download the newest version after you install the CD. And BANG your gamin'. I originally would only give this game 3 stars, but with the OS X compatibility came an extra.Necris"
4,Nice,NICE! NICEEE! this is the ultimate death match and I hope they make quake 4 sooner than later.....it ran fine on my 500mhz MAC!
2,Send in the clones,"Out of the box Q3A is terrible. It's like a Q2 clone, with all the same old weapons. Q3A is like a Friday the 13th movie nothing new and the format is just plain lame. I originally bashed UT but compared to Q3A, UT is a godsend. Maybe some of the Mods for Q3A will help but they better be some damn good Mods. Hopefully TF2 will save the First Person Shooter, cause Q3A sure doesn't."
3,The best multiplayer shooter? I think not.,"First off, this is stricktly a multiplayer game catering to the multiplayer market. It is best played with a cable modem or some other form of high-speed connection. Those of us with dial-up modems are at a sore disadvantage. Those with dial-up connections move far more slowly and are easier to hit than those lucky souls with cable modems. Also, the short single-player game included is not only boring, but is really just a way to train for multiplayer bouts online. Furthermore, the game, while a solid offering, isn't nearly as fun or a technically impressive as Unreal Tournament. Buy this game only if you don't have the cahoneys to buy the far-superior Unreal Tournament."
3,Just OK,"For me, a deep thought provoking book stays with me for at least a few days or even weeks after I've read it as I think about the story and the questions raised. I liked this book and it's a fast read but it's not a book that stayed in my thoughts for more than a day after I finished it. Maybe it's just me."
3,interesting read,"I really enjoyed reading "" The Devil and Miss Prym"". The entire time I was reading it I was thinking what would I do... it's a story that makes you think about life choices. Can,t wait to discuss it at bookgroup!"
5,Great read,This was a very intriguing book. It was so good I read the whole thing the same day I received it in the mail.
4,Good vs. Evil,"I love this book, though it is not as compelling as The Alchemist. This book asks what a person's true nature is-- good or evil. The narration is great, and so is the character-development. I like the portrayal of good and evil and how these two forces struggle in the characters of the ""stranger"" and Ms. Prym, and all the other simple people in the little town of Viscos. Read it. You might actually like it, too. All I know is I can hardly put the material down."
3,Puzzled by the praise...,"This book received such praise, and certainly others who have reviewed it on Amazon include such hyperbole as ""THE BEST EVER!!!"". I'm at a loss to understand this. The story bumps along akwardly at the beginning - the plot gears up with all the smoothness of an organ grinder just beginning to turn the crank. Once the story gets going, it really does become compelling, and the middle of the book provides much food for thought. The ending has glimpses of the profound, but is rather messily and hastily tied up and dumped at the curb. One piece of the resolution (I won't give it away) has no foundation in the many ""deals"" made between the two main characters - and I ripped through the pages several times trying to find the explanation I surely had missed, only to toss the book aside frustrated when I didn't find it. All in all, the author has an eye for a topic, a good idea how to frame the debate, but the story needs a lot more tightening up to really pull it off."
4,Paulo Coelho is never a let down,"Articulates in a materialistic way the pull of temptation wihtin humanity, revealing there are many sides to any predicament."
2,great idea!! terrible execution,Skip this book altogether and read Stephen King's Needful Things instead. It's like an annecdotal Coehlo reminiscing on last summer's hay fever when you've actually have read The Stand.
2,"Good, Evil, Good, Evil- bla, bal, blah","When this book was chosen for my book club I was looking forward to reading it since ""The Alchemist"" is my all time favorite book. ""The Devil & Miss Prym"" could have been easily written into a short story fable. Al no point did it grip me or suck me into the story line. I was disappointed as were 6 out of 6 of my book club members. Read ""The Alchemist"" !!!"
4,nice novel,When I first read the title of the novel it somewhat surprised me. A devil and a miss this is what interested me reading the book and of course as it was paulo coelho's novel so I was a bit sure when I was going to start reading this book that it would surely interest me.This book also relates some part of our life too. It shows that every person has a good and bad person in himself but we realise it only when we are into a situation and that bad person of us is seen. A very good novel as paulo coelho's other novels are for self help.I would like to recommend this book to everyone.
2,Mark Twain does it better,"I love Paulo Coelho's books but I must admit this is not one of my favorites. It's a decent book but it lacks in many ways. The characters, thought process, and even originality.If you like the premise of this book, then I suggest you read ""The man that corrupted Hadleyburg."" by Mark Twain. It's much shorter than Coelho's version and the idea is better developed. You can read it here for free:[...]Or just google it, amazon will more than likely edit this post."
4,am i good or evil,"in essence, my belief of human beings is this: they are basically good and evil. which this book confirms, considering a long shot. it's a fast read, and really a thinker-book, Coelho goes into deep imagination, and limits himself to no limit. but i wasn't fully satisfied, something was missing, probably a love story, or a stronger will from Chantal to get off the town."
2,preachy and unoriginal,"I have to say I was expecting a lot more from this book. The fact that Coelho basically lifted his plot wholesale from Durrenmatt's play ""The Visit"" was disappointing. At least he does acknowledge it in the beginning, but this doesn't change the fact that, having read Durrenmatt's play first, Coelho didn't really accomplish anything Duerrenmatt didn't already do, in a much less preachy and more innovative way. The characters are stick figures which get pushed around and serve as excuses for long-winded passages on the problem of good and evil, passages which read more like watered down mass-market self-help than a novel. There's no character development to speak of, and the ""stranger comes to idyllic middle-of-nowhere town and shakes things up"" plot-line has been done, oh, a few times I think. If you find the content or theme interesting, then just go read Durrenmatt's ""The Visit"" or see it performed somewhere. College students always love to do it. Skip this book."
1,Not for me....,"I can't understand how this book is so popular and a ""national bestseller."" I'm hoping it is due to the fact that The Alchemist was such a wonderful book that others (like myself) eagerly await another hit by this writer. However, after having read three other books by Mr. Coelho since The Alchemist, I'm finally throwing in the towel because I just don't think they're anything more than ok. Sure, they have all been centered on larger issues of morality, life, and the tough questions we find ourselves asking (such as whether man inherently good or evil, as this book tries to examine). But they have all, this one most of all, seemed too trite to me, considering the weight of their underlying themes. While I appreciate how Mr. Coelho tries to explore interesting and difficult questions, I found this novel in particular undreadable and didn't care enough to find out what the townspeople did at the end of the book...I simply stopped reading."
1,The Devil Is In The Premise And The Prose,"This book barely and rarely transcends silly. It is a sad commentary about the psyche and intellect of this country that a book like this is a best seller. That it's also an Oprah recommendation is equally defining. You might ask why I read this book, or read it through. It was assigned as a topic by a discussion group my wife and I belong to. Otherwise, had I started it for whatever reason, I would have put it down after a page or two. (I would love to know if Oprah actually read this pedestrian piece of drivel before putting it on her list.)"
2,Wrong module,"Despite the specific claim to be compatible with the Dell GX110, this memory module DID NOT function in my machine. However, after my consultation with tech support the vendor cheerfully offered to refund my money. So, five stars to the vendor (presuming I do eventually get a refund) and two stars for the product. Footnote: Finally got the correct memory module from ""another"" vendor who has the same exact mailing address. Go figure?Update Jan. 18 - finally received credit on this return, but it wasn't the vendor's fault, Amazon dropped the ball. But everything eventually got taken care of, no problems with either party."
4,"had to read for school, very pleasantly surprised","This book combines historical fact with science fiction in a wonderful way. I had to read it for a literature class at Rutgers, and I am glad I ACTUALLY read this one. It's cool to see an early example of an android in literature, and all of the moral issues raised by the process.Great read."
3,Cronometro se daño,"El reloj es muy bueno pero me vino con falla en el cronometro,esto me di cuenta al usarlo por tercera vez.."
5,Living Light is the best way to start your day and finish it,"It's interesting to call this book a ""devotional"" because actually every word of it is from the Bible. Dr. Ken Taylor had originally put this together using the King James Version and called it ""Daily Light."" Then, after he produced the full Bible in the paraphrase ""Living Bible"", he went back and put the same ""devotional"" into the words of the Living Bible. There is a reading for each morning and for each evening of each day of the year by date, so you can use it perpetually. Our family -- when I was growing up -- would read it and try to guess where the verses were from in the Bible, that was a lot of fun! The answers, of course, are at the bottom of each page. I would recommend this with 25 stars instead of 5 if I could. And I agree with the previous reviewer who says it ought to be reprinted. But get yourself a used one while you can."
3,Whitney was Great!!,"Whitney's rendition of our national anthem was magnificent! However I thought the video would have been much enhanced by a brief commentary. The crowd' reaction to Ms. Houston's performance ws as significant as the performance itself (after all what is a performer without an audience?). The emotional response of the audience was a testimony to Ms.Houston ability to deliver a song, and should have been included in the video."
2,Too short!,"It is true that her music is just wonderful, but thisvideo is too short. Just 4 minute 30 seconds.I want more!!!"
5,absolutely wounderful,ithoguht her voice was a miricle the strenght and power she displayed i thought was wounderful and amasing
3,gameboy color,My daughter wanted a handheld game console so we bought it. She's only 2 but the images on it are not good. You really can't see a great picture.
2,not a workout video,"Beware! The title is misleading. You won't get any workout from this video. Moreover I bought her other videos and found exactly the same content in one of them...This is a ripoff.Samra mostly explains different rhythms and shows a few combinations for each of them. The combinations are rather simple and she does not seem to be a very dynamic dancer. If you want to get good belly dance instruction, I would recommend Aziza, Jayna or Princess Farhana's videos.For bellydance workout, better try Neon, Ayshe, Neena and Veena."
4,Great Supplemental Reading on Adlerian Theory,I read this short book as a supplement to my textbook for my theories of counseling class and I found it very useful for better understanding the Adlerian Theory which is based on the work of Alfred Adler. It is very reader friendly.
2,Not the best choice,"Autenrieth is a little outdated now, although the pictures are amusing. A better dictionary for Homeric Greek is Richard Cunliffe'sLexicon of the Homeric Dialect."
3,Inferior to Cunliffe,"Autenrieth will do the job and its illustrations are helpful, but the work is inferior to Cunliffe's A Lexicon of the Homeric Dialect, which includes the vocabulary of the Homeric Hymns (in addition to the Iliad and Odyssey) as well as book and line references to all the occurences a given word appears within the Homeric corpus."
2,Deceiving at first,This dictionary is quite hard to work with... It doesn't quite give you what you usually want... Actually what you're mostly going to find is the number of the lines where the word appears... which isn't quite useful depending on your goal... Plus the words are badly defined... it's going to give you different weird endings sometimes mixed up.. that you won't even you the case or gender .. etc..But I found it much more useful with the Odyssey than with the Iliad...T would say this dictionary is for experts.. and as an Intermediate student.. I was disappointed by it..
3,STAGS,Must see Indie. It was an audience hit at the VisionFest in Tribeca this past year. Film by rising New York based director-writer Jamie Greenberg
5,"Fantastic teaching tool for fans, too","This is a great instructional DVD, not only for wrestlers but for fans. I learned a lot from listening to Dan Gable's explanations and watching the demonstrations by the Zadick brothers. What I learned from the DVD has made watching wrestling matches even more enjoyable."
1,VGN-140P is very easy to break comparing to others,"I broguth VGN-140P from Amazon last March, but it alreay have broken twice already. The first time, 3 months after I brought it, when I was on a trip to asia, the LCD broke without warning (cracked), since I was outside of the US, I had to pay for the repair on my own for over $600 to replace the LCD. Now it broke again. This time, the computer will be freezen whenever I move the computer. I reformat the disk and install the system several time, no help. I had a Vaio SK notebook for over 4 years, it is still worked very well, heavily used, not easy to break at all. But this VGN-140P is so easy to break, I like the size, but I don't like the quality and the reliability. I have 3 notebooks all of them are sony, but not anymore, I am going to get a new one, not SONY for sure. Maybe Panasonic Roughbook should be better than Vaio."
3,"Okay, but not great","Not a bad text. It is well-written and clear, but lacks depth. Slightly oversimplified. There is not a sufficient variety of problems. I taught from this text and found that I had to supplement it with my own information."
3,could be better,the book theory part is useless. the problems for the chapter are well presented except for the computational section which unless you know how to use MATLAB it can be disastrous. The examples could be a little more explanatory but in general if you have a good physics background and know multivariate calculus you can understand
3,its alright,i wish they give more simpler examples. a lot of concepts requires a very deep physics background
5,"Seems okay, presentation was clear and logical",Was able to understand the examples and the illistrations were clear. Materialwell covered
5,Good etertainment for the whole amily,"The Librarian: Curse of the Judas ChaliceThis is a well done movie made for TV that is good for the whole family. It has drama, comedy, horror, and a mix of just good old sentimentality."
4,The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice,This movie was not as good as the last two but it still had its merits. I thought it was a sad ending. And that perhaps the damsel could have been around to help the librarian.
5,The Librarian-3rd movie in the series,"Delivered in good condition and promptly. This is the third movie in ""The Librarian"" series. I own all three now. The librarian has become a little bored with his job and decides to take a vacation in New Orleans where he meets a female vampire. She's a good vampire and together they stop an evil vampire from controlling the world. The added comedy in these action movies is really cute. I purchased the 2nd and the 3rd movies of the series from amazon.com I am always satisfied with my purchases. Anytime my friend says she is trying to find something, I suggest amazon.com. I always find what I need from there. It's gotten to be an ongoing joke. ""I want to find...."" Just go to amazon.com"
5,Noah Wyle Does It Again!,"Noah Wyle once again portrays The Librarian, searching for relics for an unbelievably vast library. I'm a fan of Noah's and really enjoy this character he has developed. He plays so well opposite Bob Newhart and their characters and lines work together to create quite a team. This movie is not only humorously enjoyable, but quite a learning experience along the way. Sit back and enjoy!"
5,Nice company to deal with.,I ordered 5 dvd's all on the same day. I received 4 . This company sent it before promised date. I will be back for sure.
5,GOTTA LOVE NOAH WYLE,I LOVE NOAH WYLIE. I HAVE SEEN ALL THE LIBRARIAN MOVIES AND THEY ARE GREAT. GREAT FUN.
5,Very good,"Enjoyed it very much. None are as good as the first one. But I would buy a fourth one, if one comes out. Like to see it with the cast of the first Librarian."
2,Too cheesy,Way to cheesy for my taste. Couldn't tell if it was trying to be comedic or a vampire movie.
2,Curse of the Librarian,"Sad to say,this DVD is a big waste of time. Noah Wiley tries to be quirky and charming but fails miserably because he doesn't balance these traits with any personal strength and authority. Echoing at different times James Bond, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter his character seems weak , derivative and unsympathetic. The plot has lots of holes and tries to do too much without sufficiently building suspense. The other characters seem even shallower than the Librarian.(Makes me really appreciate the old B-movies. ) The story takes some childish turns with the writers wanting us to believe that a magic sword (Excalibur) is the Librarian's ""best friend"".( Yuh). Not charming in the least. Avoid this."
1,vampires...,My family didn't like this movie. It isn't for the family and was a bit gross. Just not as enjoyable as the other movies in this series.
1,the librarian curse of the judas chalice,** Not for children. ** Why did they put sex in this story?It does not help the plot.
4,The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice,A good movie if you had a very hard day at work and need something towatch that you don't have to think about.
5,Love It!,"I love the entire 'Librarian' series and this was no exception! I was also happy with the price as when new movies come out in the stores, if you don't get them within the first WEEK, you end up paying too much. This is a movie I will watch over and over again!"
4,Fun Movie,"It's a fun movie. I liked the first Librarian movie better and I wish it was available too. If you like the cheesy syfy type movies, you'll probably enjoy this."
5,My husband adores this series. Love Noah Wiley,This is a great third episode of the Librarian. My husband loves this series and was not disappointed with the third installment.
4,Terrific find.,The DVD and case were in excellent shape. Very satisified with the price and the quality of product.
5,STOP!,"If you haven't bought the other two Librarian movies, be sure to add them to the cart and watch them in order.I bought them looking for something a little different, with action, that could be seen by my then 10 year old son. I like Noah Wyle so I thought I'd give it a shot. I thought they would be a kind of watered down Indiana Jones. Boy, was I wrong. They stand alone in the terrific entertainment department.Although not the biggest fan of Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin, I have to admit they did a fantastic job. They've also brought in good actors that you don't see a lot of these days, like Gabrielle Anway, Robert Foxworth, Kyle MacLachlan, and Bruce Davidson. No, it's not realistic, although they contain a lot of interesting historical information and references. It's pure escapism and lots of fun.My son loves all three, although the third is his favorite. There really isn't anything a kid can't see.We're both hoping that there will be more of these -- and soon!"
2,Search for the holy grail of Vampires,"Third time around the Librarian decides to take a vacation to New Orleans where he meets a vampire who gives him an amulet to protect, while ex KGB agents try to steal it, so they can raise Count Dracula from the dead to help ""restore mother Russia back to her glory""This one didn't seem to have the spirit of the first 2 movies, however it was a refreshing change to get out of the jungles and such and into the swamps filled with pirate ships, vampires, tombs, amulets and the full intention of making 100 more sequels."
2,Lackluster,"This episode was a bit of a stretch, like they were really trying too hard. The storyline was just too weak to really hold my interest. The special effects were not up to the standard of the first two movies. All in all a disappointing effort."
3,The Librarian,"Indiana Jones all over gain. Nothing new. I really likeNoah Wyle (Falling Skies), but give him a betterchance over Harrison Ford. No contest."
1,DVD's do not play,Love the movies but will be returning the set since they do not play. Not sure but I think its a european formatting problem?
5,A Wicked Twist of Fate,"I've read this novel by Ron Dondiego entitled A Wicked Twist of Fate and was utterly mesmerized by its pages. It is one that I like to call a page turner, I kept reading and turning. I couldn't get enough of it. It seems that I was mesmerized. The story is a gripping novel about a man who makes a bad decision after having been disappointed in love. In a desperate attempt to salvage his life the main character, Jerry Brenner, commits a triple murder. He is convinced that through these murders he will gain both wealth and prestige. The ending will blow your mind. Mr. Dondiego keeps his reader spell bound with this tale set in the late forties in New York. Buy it, you won't be able to put it down."
1,Sorry. I don't think so,"This book was recommended to me by Amazon, so I took a chance on it and was very disappointed. The writing is juvenile and overflowing with cliches; the narration is self-conscious and bombastic; the dialogue is uninteresting and unrealistic; the ideas and descriptions are redundant, superfluous, and unimpressive."
5,Just like Rachel's,This knife is just like the ones used by Rachel Ray on her TV shows. The blade is super sharp and the handle fits nicely in your hand.
1,Strange knife,"This knife is weighted improperly. The blade is too heavy for the handle and it feels as if the whole knife is being pulled down, which is an unpleasant way to cut. It got dull very quickly with just routine use and I don't recommend it at all. Just another example of ""celebrity"" (I use the term loosely) branding and the lemmings who will buy anything."
5,A Wonderful Find At A Reasonable Price! A++,"I just purchased this knife after having purchased the smaller 5 inch Furi Knife. I liked the 5 inch version so much that I wanted to add this one to the collection. I find that this knife is far more comfortable to use than the Wustof Santoku Knife that I already own. While I saw that other reviewers were put off by the color of the handle, the handle is quite comfortable and makes chopping far easier with less fatigue. I sometimes find that the Wustof Santoku Knife, while a great knife with a great reputation for quality, became uncomfortable to use after lengthy chopping and cutting sessions in the kitchen. This Furi knife, on the other hand, is simply wonderful; and despite other reviews about the orange handle, the ease of use makes up for the color. The handle is quite comfortable and the grip makes it easier to chop and cut without fatigue. Highly recommend!!!"
2,I've had better,"The cheap, gummy, orange handle makes this knife a no-go. I'm sure there are those who love it, but when given this knife as a gift, I was disappointed that I didn't get the one I really wanted. Who ever came up with the idea of an orange handle? Ick!As with some santukos, it doesn't do well slicing through melons and other larger items. You would do better with a chef's knife. But other model santukos beat this one in performance, in my opinion.Buying a knife is a very individual thing, and people choose what fits their hands. I happen to prefer something with a real handle that doesn't feel like it's chapstick-coated. If you have larger hands, as I do, you may wish to try something else."
2,Grip coming loose,"We bought the 7-inch knife a little over a year ago via one of the Amazon sellers and have enjoyed using it. However, I've noticed the grip is starting to come loose. Due to the angle of the ""wobble"", I'm concluding that the tang does not extend all the way through the handle, which is something I would expect on an expensive knife. The tang is also very thin, like you would expect to see on a file or rasp. I've looked on line in order to contact furi directly, but can't seem to find any way to contact them. BTW, we take care of our knives carefully and don't put them in the dishwasher or abuse them in any way."
4,soft goth of the ages,"England made me, and black box is a rather down-cast eyes version of sub culture soft goth.It carries overtones of meloncholy and twisted smiles.I personally love it, and will often have it playing in the background while I do various things around my home.Sometimes parts are a little surprising, but even the happy moments, rather remind one of the happy clown.... sitting in the corner, with the twisted grin and dirty face."
2,Unhappy!,"I was so happy to find this Game Boy for my son, he has been wanting the retro game for awhile.When it arrived the back for the batterie section was not included.The game dose work so that is a plus."
3,It works,"The game boy works, but magnifier / light that was advertised is broken and doesn't work! The battery compartment is broken and none of the connections are aligned, so the batteries don't even fit! Pretty disappointing."
3,Fun for Car Rides,Fun for long car rides. I gave it to my nephew. He loves it! Cool for a birthday gift or something.
2,delivered quickly,"i like how fast the system was delivered, i'll give you that.and it was in good conditionwhat i DIDN'T like was how you sent me the solid purple game boy color, and not the atomic one i asked for.luckily my baby sister didn't seem to mindyou should doublecheck what you send out"
4,Not as good as gameboy pocket,I enjoy this gameboy a lot but its less portable because its a bit bigger than the pocket gameboy but o well.I really don't think color is a big deal but thats just me.If I were u I'd get this system if u have big pockets but if you don't get the pocket system
1,I don't get it.,"Why would anyone pay $350 for a Game Boy Color?!?!?!?! This makes no sense to me. You can get the same thing for like $25. There are much more logical ways to spend $350 these days, such as a VACATION........sounds better to me."
1,Careful what you order,"I ordered a kiwi game boy instead I got a special edition game boy, send the right console next time!!"
5,GBC- FYI-( Game Boy Color),This is the best system that they did come out with beside's the GBA and GBA SP and technically the original game boy advance really wasn't all that great it was just a spin off of the game boy color the only difference smaller games the GBA SP is pretty good back light on screen and charger that plugs in to my wall yeah it's nice but it doesn't quite have the same old feeling I get when I play the game boy color the GBC bring's back a lot of good old memories excellent games for that system even when I look here or at gamestop or electronic boutiques I alway ask for the older games you just can't beat old school no matter how hard you try yeah some of the newer game's are alright but I still like old school games nothing beats them better the GBC is exactly like the GBA SP only the GBC doesn't fold and doesn't have the smaller games that's the only difference and the GBC does have a charger that can plug in to the wall because I looked into it on this website: [...].
5,Nice Game System,"I've always wanted a Game Boy, ever since I was like 6, and I had saw them for sale in Canadian Tire and Zellers. But of course, my parents said No, You will just break it and It will be $$ down the drain. Okay. So I had forgot about it until I saw the Game Boy Color. I got a GBC for christmas and have taken it on every trip ive ever been on. Its like a Mini Super Ninendo or Original Nintendo, which I really like playing. I can see it in the night by using a worm light, so I play games at night and take it everywhere. Game Boy Color Is The Best!"
4,Color is cool,"Most people will tell you that the nintendo 64 is a much better console to play than the gameboy color, But they have entirely different styles. I am sick of seeing a new game on the 64 and seeing it in that 1st person type of view which has proven quite popular since mario 64 was introduced. Now suddenly every game has moulded in that type of format when it is not always the best option. The gameboy color however, has kept that lovable format of games with the side scrolling screen such as double dragon. This is a favourite of gamers and is being sufficated by games like :- Mario 64, Banjo Kazooi, James bond golden eye, Spyro, Asterix, Doom, Spyro 2, Zelda, and many more. Yes the 64 has better graphics, but the gameplay is not always as good as the gameboy color!"
2,It needs better games,"You know, it still amazes me that a system that is 10 years old can still be as popular now as it was the year it was released. Let me start by saying that if you don't like nintendo and/or their mascot games, then your waisting your money, because nintendo is the only company making quality games for it. Not only that, it isn't even backlit. If your a casual gamer/ pokemon fan, then this is a wise investment, simply because the games nintendo puts out are very well done. But if your looking for a system that has more than one company making good games for it, then get either the Sega Nomad or the Neo Geo Pocket Color. No matter how you look at it, this system is slowly losing its steam."
4,great and fun,this isnt bad i have it and it works great i think this is better then alot of older systems like game boy or super nt but still its a good system.
2,Do Not Strain Your Eyes!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My husband and I just purchased this G.B. for our 6yr. old son, and from the moment we put it on we thought something was wrong with it. It is nearly impossible to see the screen! It is dark even during the day. I had the black and white and believe that that is a better product. Today I will be purchasing the worm light hoping that will make a difference if it does not it's all being retuned as damaged goods. The toy it self has great graphics and games but what differnce does it make when viewing is a chore."
2,Game Boy Color,I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal.
2,Sorry........Neo Geo Pocket is better!,"I have tried both Neo Geo Pocket and game boy color, and NGPC is better. It has a joy stick, and better graphics, plus some really good games like metal slug first mission, sonic the hedghog, fighting games-which i really enjoy, and many more. Compared to gameboy color NGPC has a very low stock of games, but remember, that stock is rising! I really like the link cable that you can buy seperately for NGPC. you hook the link cable to To two NGPC's and you can play a two player game with your friend. Game Boy color doesn't have a link cable or anything of the sort. I own a Neo Geo Pocket!"
2,Gameboy is starting to show it's age,"If there is one thing that Nintendo should try and improve about the gameboy, it should be the games. Sure, it is true that there are over 500 games available, but of those 500, only about 30 are tolorable. And good luck trying to find any of the earlier games, the only place to find the old games are at Funco Land. Add in the fact that Nintendo is the only company making quality games for it, it isn't back lit, and there are only two action buttons, and you'll start to see that the gameboy is in serious trouble."
2,"Game Boy Color, No LIght-No Play!","I recently purchased a Game Boy Color System as a time killer for when I travel. Lord knows for me and the kiddies out there that you darn near have to be under direct sunlight to get a good picture of the game. If you plan to take it on a plane or let your kids play with it in the car at night while you are driving, forget it. Nintendo claims that they used state of the art reflective technology in it's design, I just don't see it(LITERALLY). It should be backlit, so it can be used in all lighting conditions. My Sony Watchman works perfectly clear in most lighting conditions, this the kind of design nintendo should strive to attain."
5,Best Ever!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this for Christmas and it is the best. I had the original Gameboy and it didnt work very well, well it worked OK but it wasnt the best. I would tell every one about if I could. If you are thinking about buying this, GO FOR IT! Its really fun and goes everywhere. There arnt very many coises of colors but the ones they have are great. I can also see the screen very well other than some people.Gameboy COLORS are the best!!!!"
4,very cool,"The Game Boy Color is very cool. I once saw someone playing Pokémon Gold and it inspired me to start saving for one myself. I like it be cause it is not just one game you play over and over, but it has a very wide variety of games to play on it. I think this is a very good product."
4,A Cool Gameboy Color,"Hi, Im a nine year old gamer. I bought this when I was 7 and loved it! It was cool since it is portable. I am buying the Pokemon Version of the Gameboy Color. I much rather have a GBC than a Gameboy Advance. This system is awesome. You can get ""the best games"" like Pokemon or Zelda.The system can play 400 sumthen games. Great gift for the holidays too. Hope this helped a little!"
5,good!! better tham neogeo better than gba buy it,This machine is amazing I have a neogeopocketcolor and a gba but GBC is the best.I got a GBA for my birthday and it suck[if your wondering how I got it I imported it from JPN].I still play my GBC more than my GBA the GBC is better because its simpler to buy games and cheaper.I got nothing to say about neogeopocketcolor it SUCKS!! Buy a GBC you will never be sorry.
2,Small Details,"Overall, the quality of the product was to satisfaction. But when there are small things like the start or select buttons sticking, they should be plainly disclosed in the description of the product."
5,"Bought it for my daughter, but now I play with it too!","I am thoroughly enjoying my daughter's Game Boy -- we got it for her for Christmas along with a ""Tetris"" game. It is more fun that I thought it would be! She loves the Game Boy as well and once in awhile, we let her use it! :-)"
4,"Good in game selection, bad in screen","The problem with GBC is that the screen is really difficult to see. Also the screen protector is reflective, if you put light above it, you will see the light source very easily, which makes the screen even more difficult to see. Maybe I am too picky, but my eye hurts after playing after a while.The case is tall in height and narrow in width which makes holding it while playing games tiresome.It looks like the new ""Gameboy advance"" solves the two problems and I will get one when it is available and retire GBC."
4,great portable amusement,"the only complaint i have about the gameboy is that the screen *really* needs a backlight. it's horrible squinting & trying to see what's going on.once you have enough light, though, it's lots of fun. i usually play it on long plane rides."
4,It's Great,"It's very fun to play with anytime, any where(especially on a trip). It's so fun that my sister wanted one."
2,no cover,I bought this game boy to share with my grand kids and when i tried it out you cant see the games I bought for it plus no cover in the back to hold the batteries. this doesnt change my mind about amazon I'm still keep on shopping through amazon.
3,"Deal, you get what you pay for.","It works yes, but apprently under good condition all it has to do is power up and play, no color, no sound. But I payed almost nothing for it so I can not complain to much."
1,Gameboy color Dandelion hand held game system,"Ordered this got it paid $44.00 dollars way overpriced!!! My grandson could barely see the screen had alot of scratches on the screen !!, U have to remember these game boys r from the 1980s ok and they have no light on the screen to where u can play them !!! So try not to pay to much for these so Buyer Warning please read beforeBuying a used Gameboy oh and the game will break after a few days as well from taken the game out and exchanging it and putting in another game!! Wear and tear ok . Please try to order newer style versions better saf than sorry . KC ."
3,ITS OK BUT NOT THE BEST,"the gameboy is not as good as it sounds first you can buy it cheeper other places, and there is not much things you can buy for it,& the games get boring quickly, the good things are that you can buy a radio,light rechargeable batteries,& charger for under $20 if you look otherwise it is good for starters."
3,ITS OK,IT IS A OK SYSTEM BUT THE SOUND ANT TO GREAT IF YOUR INTO FIGHTING (1 ON 1 GAMES) DONT GET IT . IF YOUR INTO FIGHTING GAMES GET THE NEO GEO POCKET THEY ONLY MADE 40 GAMES BUT MOST OF THEM ARE FIGHTING. NEO GEO POCKET DOES NOT MAKE GAMES ANY MORE
5,Game boy color,It is not as good as a GBA (game boy advance) But it is the only game boy with infrared. Also unlike the GBA it has an adaptor input. the only draw back is unlike the Game Boy pocket it takes 2 AA batteries.
5,Good Fun!,"Some consoles like Dreamcast and N64 are really good, but hard to carry around. Ether in teh house or ont eh read this console rules! I would like it to maby be a bit smaller like the pockets, but other wise its really cool. Some of the games you play on the computer, well like Tomb Raider are good, but the controls are so confusing! But on the GBC's versiond of the game is really easier to controol and still has all that good stuff. Its a really good console. And the Atomic Purple is the one i have and its really cool. So BUY THIS ITEM!!! Its really good."
4,Going old-school with GBC...,"While GBC has nothing on the new Game Boy Advance, it's still good when you just can't find the new guy. (Like me.) The seethrough is really cool, and fun to look at if you're bored. If you've never had a Game Boy in your life, this is your big chance! It's cheaper than the GBA and can actually fit in your pocket, unlike GBA, who is too wide."
4,For long flights,"For the 20+ crowd it becomes useful in situations like long flights, just be sure to buy ""complex"" game titles like zelda, or you'll be dissapointed with the short and easy games. Perfect to rotate with a good business or computer/software book (400 pages max. or you will struggle to read it on a plane) and your laptop. Almost forgot: Remember to buy a light for these one, and a couple of extra batteries."
4,good for gameboy color games,"have some old gameboy color games around? only have an original gameboyor super gameboythis is great for old games, and is duruable, afordable, and lasts a long time on batteries, but if you like gba games too the gameboy advance sp is for you, plus is has a backlight. these last a long time, and sell for about $14.99 on adverage."
4,"Good value overall, but expect to squint","I had the original GameBoy when it came out 10 years ago, and I liked it a lot. The new color version is definitely a long-needed upgrade, but unfortunately Nintendo did this one on the cheap and skimped on the most important aspect of the system - the color screen. Not only is the screen tiny, but the colors are rarely as vibrant as they look on the advertisements. The screen can be very difficult to see under most lighting conditions. (I have actually found florescent lighting to be best.) That flaw aside, the games make this system... and there are hundreds of them, and many of them are very good. Even though I practically am blind after playing for more than a few minutes, I use my GameBoy color more than any other game system. It's easy to take with you, and even if you are over 12 (like me) there are games that you will enjoy during the daily bus commute or whatever."
2,Bad graphics,I was disapointed. This game has so bad graphics. It stunk on ice. You don't know when it will run out of batteries. Get a gameboy advance SP because it has a light. It's worth the money unlike gameboy colors. To bad the stars don't go into negatives.
2,"maybe once, but not anymore","This system has undergone basically NO changes since it's inception, save a few casing adjustments, and most recently, an upgrade to color. Well that doesn't excuse the fact that it's still an 8-bit portable, in a 128-bit era. There once was a time when GB was king of the hill, but the NeoGeo Pocket Color easily surpasses it in terms of technology, graphics, and % of good games. It's obvious that Nintendo is content to sit back and watch as wave after wave of mediocre to downright poor games are released for this dinosaur. Later in 2000, the world will hopefully see the Game Boy Advance released, then maybe Nintendo can hop back on top, but until then, the phrase ""flogging a dead horse"" is all too appropriate for the ""crotchety senior citizen"" of the handheld market. I'm sure that all real gamers will unite in singing the praises of Game Boy's nearest competitor: Long live NeoGeo Pocket Color!"
3,not the best,"I have had all the gameboy game consoles except sp and let me tell you, theyre not as great as everyone says.the games are horrible , like the graphics, and the sound is ridiculous. If youre smart youd do what I did and buy a Sega Gamegear, theyre awesome!!!"
2,ok product...,"I recieved this for a christmas present and opened it right up. The design is fair. The sterno container that I purchased did not fit in the holder that was included. I traveled to 13 stores to see if they carried the smaller 2.6 oz cans to no avial. The flame was not as big as I had hoped, since the product display shows everyone can toast at once. I did end up using the adaptor top as reccomended and the flame is so condenced that only 1 or 2 people can toast at once. Very sad:( ... Best thing about it is that I am the only one that has one, so everyone hangs out at my place a little more."
5,"""RADIATION NIL, OXYGEN NORMAL.....""","""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" is one of the best ""Doctor Who"" adventures of all time. It has excitement, awe and wonder, terror, and humor mixed into an epic tale of conquest and survival! William Hartnell gives a fine portrayal of the Doctor, and the storytelling and acting are top-notch! The farewell to the character of Susan Foreman (the Doctor's granddaughter, played by Carole Ann Ford) makes for one emotional ending!Sadly, the DVD extras aren't the best. The featurettes have fine interviews, but are so lengthy and boring, no one really cares what their talking about. However, the six-part serial more than makes up for it! Any ""Doctor Who"" fan will not wanna miss ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" on DVD!Program Grade: A+ (5 Stars)DVD Grade: B+ (4 Stars)Overall Grade: A- (5 Stars)"
5,Doctor Who Dalek invasion of Earth,I had never seen the William Hartnell years of doctor who which never seemed to air on PBS with the other classic Doctor who episodes. I have to say this Doctor who was fantastic both the story itself and the bonus features that include what the film location area looked like then and now as well as troubles they had filming a suppose to be deserted city in the future. Once again the Daleks show their one of the greatest villians in the doctor who rogue gallery.
3,"""What you need is a jolly good smacked bottom!""","An incredibly overrated Who serial and Dalek story, only because it's the second Dalek serial and it's set on Earth. The problem with this serial is that it is very, very slow going, even for a Hartnell adventure, and the Robomen(oh, my COD!)are ploddingly slow and stupid, and how the Robomen are supposed to frighten us is a question I've been asking for years. The lack of scientific credibilty is also very annoying, the Slyther(and just what the heck is ""The Waking Ally""?), uninspired acting and not enough Daleks really spoil everything.But, there is some great things, as well. The direction & execution is very halucinatory, the Daleks running around London is fun, and their renaming of monuments and other things is way cool, and Susan has a very emotional leaving scene."
1,I didn't receive this item.,I order this item one month ago.But I didn't receive it yet.I don't komw why.I try to contect with this seller.I didn't get any return either.
5,Works great,"We couldn't figure out how to change it over to Centigrade, so it only reads in Fahrenheit, but that's fine for us. It has a nice big display, updates fast, is really easy to use, and has lasted us over a year with regular (though not daily) use, no problems with accuracy. Much nicer than other bath thermometers we've used and seen - you don't have to take it out of the water or peer at a little glass tube to read it."
5,Gabbys thermometer,We bought this thermometer in new Zealand where we live and both my partmer and I swear by it. It is accurate and we both love that it has an alarm that sounds when the temp is too high.We have been searching for another couple to get for friends that are having babies as it is one of the items that we have used EVERY DAY since we had Gabby.Well worth the money and piece of mind knowing that the bath is just right before putting your little one in.Gina.
5,Great!,This duck is cute and works great. It's very easy to just drop in the water and it beeps loudly if it's too hot. We love it!
1,For experts only.,"This book would probably make a good textbook for a college course on international financial affairs, but for someone like myself who just wanted to know what the gold standard was, this book is like pulling teeth. Mr. Eichengreen's ""Golden Fetters"" just goes into too much detail. By page nine of the introduction I wished I hadn't bought the book, by page 30 I was ready to donate it to the local library. If you live and breathe the stock market or international finance, this book may be for you. I'll just wait for a good documentary on the subject on television."
1,yamaha crw 2200ix-vk-disk drive,IT WAS NOT A USB DISK DRIVE AND DO NOT FUNCTION WHITH MY ASER COMPUTER.I HAD NO USE FOR IT.
5,awesome,This cd is awesome. The band is awesome. The songs make you want to get up and dance. BUY THIS CD.
2,somewhat useful,"The maps rendered are decent representations of actual topo maps, but I have found in some instances that roads and trails are off by quite a bit. By quite a bit, I mean, I have seen asphalt roads that are off by a couple of clicks! This was verified by a very accurate GPS receiver. The worst thing about this software is the interface; I have used software of varying types for years, so I'm pretty good and getting around most of it. This is the most clumsy interface I've ever seen in a software product, making it difficult to impossible to use many of the features, including one of the most important, DLing and utilizing GPS data on a map. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Perhaps the latest version is better, I cannot say as I haven't had experience with it. I'll likely try NG state series software next as this is sadly lacking."
3,Interstate 82,"You can't help but feel disappointed when you play this game as it's not as good as it's prequel, Interstate 76. The graphics are noticably poor, well below current standards and the gameplay has suffered from it's shift to arcade blaster from it's previous incarnation as a simulation. The game is generally less involving and exciting, especially the first level which takes all of ten seconds to do - and you don't even need to shoot anything. But the story and acting are a diffrent matter and if the developers had spent as much time working on the game as working on the AVI, this could have been a classic. Sorry Activision, lets hope the next one is alot better!"
1,This game has a fansy box,"This game was a sorry excuse for a new game in this day and age. Though the graphics are ok, its extreamly buggy. I press the left and right key for turning the car and my computer freezes. Its extreamly simple to die, and if you die once it takes 5 minutes to reload and restart the game. If I had the chance to buy it again, i would not take it in a million years."
2,two and a half stars,"I found this book to be rather stodgy and slow-moving albeit a touching love story. Knowing what I now know about the story I probably wouldn't buy it but hey, that's just me. I'm not huge on plots that rely heavily on romance to keep the reader interested"
4,Another Keeper from Gilbert Morris,"As always, Gilbert Morris delivers a story which teaches a lot about history, in this case the history of Jewish/Russian immigrants to America, and provides an uplifting story that points to God. A lot of the struggles of the main character, Reisa, mirror the struggles many people of other faiths experience when confronted with the truth of Christianity. If you enjoy Christian fiction, especially that set in post-civil war America, you will enjoy this well written novel."
4,Jacob's Way,"The book club I belong to chose this book to read. I had never read anything by Gilbert Morris, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
3,Great for babies,"My ten month old son loves to play with any ball, so he enjoyed this one as a starter about a month or so ago. It is super soft, and he loves to chew on it. I wish I had thought of getting it when he was an infant. Ours came with the colors slightly bleeding - some of the black was on the white parts, so we were disappointed in quality. But he doesn't seem to mind!"
3,A Good game but there is a better one out there!,"To state briefly, this game is goofy. Most of the challenges are proper jumping, the enemies won't kill you as much as your jumping techniques will. Overall, the game provides more foolishness than it does entertainment."
3,pretty fun....,The game was sort of easy. The camera views and angles were not great and it was very challenging at times. Pretty fun but it got boring.
3,Candid Comments,"This is a good book for someone putting together a resume for the first time. However, it is outdated. There have been many updates to resume writing, especially focusing on today's difficult job market. This is an 11 year old book. I would concentrate on more updated resume writing books."
4,Very good guide,The book had very good examples of resumes and a good step by step process. The worksheets were helpful and provided a good outline to focus my thinking.
4,A Stronger Kinship review,"The book is well researched and well written. I live in Covert (the town depicted in the book) and my husband was raised there. I am involved in the community and have spoken to several of the residents interviewed for the book. They felt it was an accurate depiction of life inCovert, and my husband's recollections of the stories told to him as a child cofirm this. I met Ms. Anna-Lisa Cox this summer and was impressed with her dedication to telling Covert's story accurately and her continueing interest in the community. I was personally interested to read about an otherwise obscure village that was a beacon of hope to African -Americans looking for a place to be treated with dignity and respect in the 1800 and early 1900s."
1,Lack of clarity; Should have included solution sets w/ disk,"I echo many of the negative comments given by others with respect to informing the reader why he or she wants to do certain actions. As a first time database user, I find this text very frustrating.I also found frustrating that the disk enclosed with the text doesn't have the solutions for various chapters. Although the book encourages you to just jump in to the section where you are interested, your disk doesn't contain that chapter's starting point. In my view, you really ought to go through the whole book and do each step; otherwise, you don't have the proper starting point for the new chapter. The authors ought to have included the solution sets. That also helps others who might have zigged when they should have zagged."
2,Not much use to novice,I think this is a rather disorganised book and thus is not much use to novice who are new to the application MS Access.
4,Good starting point for Developers,I found the book to be a very good starting point. It interduces you to the basics of working in Access. This is definately the best starting point. I found myself wanting more. Would like to hear from advanced users where to go next.
1,Great if you want to make a database for sweet lil's candys,"Horrific. It tells you how to build the sample database. It goes through it step by step but doesn't explain anything.....eg ""make sure you have selected columnar......"" WHY??? You can't explain data normalization in a page. I needed a book that would enable me to create a working database quickly. This is a good book if you need a database for your video collection or address book. For a business it's useless."
2,Way too superficial,"This is only useful if you have absolutely no idea what MS Access is. It only gives you passable knowledge of Access, even at the secretarial level needs. No need to waste money."
5,Great self-study! Chocolate cravers beware...,"Step by Step Microsoft Access 97 is an excellent tutorial book for learning Microsoft Access 97.The book provides a comprehensive tutorial with ""Sweet Lil's Chocolater"" (hint: you might want to get a bag of Hershey kisses to treat any subsequent chocolate cravings).The tutorial disk creates a link to on-line movie clips that step the user through some of the more difficult procedures such as creating a macro. The screen shots in the book facilitated ""just-in'time"" learning.I discovered a couple of errors (a broken View Order Macro and missing Credit Letter.doc, as examples). The lesson summary for Section 2 needed more structure for this learner. Given the noted minor flaws, there was nothing that interfered with the learning process.This easy-to-read book would be helpful both as self-study and as a resource"
2,I don't recommend this book for beginners.,I agree with one of the other less kind reviews that this book tells you step by step what to do for the excercises. It does not explain the reasons behind the steps.
1,Might be good for beginners,This book is not good for learning to build a usable database. It does tell you how to build the sample database with little explanation. It doesn't even touch security.
5,A MUST-READ BOOK FOR ADVANCED STUDENTS IN THE FIELD,"Among the multitude of books written on the issue of the Post-Socialist collapse, Subversive Institutions is a true masterpiece. It is very readable, and it can serve as a good introduction for a novice in the field, and as an excellent summary to an advanced scholar. Socialism did not collapse uniformly across the region. Bunce poses and answers three main questions: the nature of the collapse, the time of the collapse, and the reason for the collapse os state socialism. Why do some countries submerge into civil wars, while some disintegrated peacefully? To provide an answer to these and other questions, Bunce looks at the differences within the institutional arrangements, the institutional designs these countries developed during tne course state socialism. Undoubtedly, the book is one of the best ever written in the field of transitology."
5,HOUSE UPON A ROCK,"from inside jacket:Derrick Slocum and Emil Hedla were on the dock talking to Jack Clements, owner of the big crab boat, Viking. Both boys wanted the same thing, the one summer job Clements had available for a high school boy.At first Derrick thought it was the engine on the Viking that made the dock shake beneath them. But then he realized it was something more. ""Earthquake!"" someone shouted, and Derrick grabbed a nearby wall to stady himself.This book is exceptionally written. Only Elsa Pedersen, who experienced the earthquake in the story, could have written a story as detailed and heartwarming as this. Having of survived an Alaskan earthquake myself and three California earthquakes, Pedersen did an outstanding job capturing the chaos of an eathquakes aftermath.The story and short, only 200 or so pages long, but the drawings by Charles Shaw bring the story together like the sweet aroma of the forget-me-nots of the Alaska mountainside."
2,Not nearly as good as I expected it to be,"I'm a big fan of Brad Blanton and loved ""Radical Honesty"" but I was disappointed in this book of personal stories written by people who have tried to apply Blanton's ""Radical Honesty"" principles to their own lives. Perhaps my expectations were too high *because* I liked ""Radical Honesty"" so much. I lost interest after reading the first few, and haven't picked the book back up."
5,1977 MGB Roadster,"The cover fits great on my 1977 MGB Roadster. I keep the car garaged, but use the cover to keep the dust off the car. I like that it fits the car exactly, and even has pockets for both of the outside mirrors. The cover is easy to put on (front is marked with a logo), and easy to take off. I also like that it soft on the inside, so doesn't scratch the bodywork. The cover folds quite neatly, so can be carried in the boot/trunk of the car.I plan to buy this cover for my other two cars as well."
5,This may fix your stiff morning neck,"I have a lot of problems with my neck from old injuries, and have had no luck with pillows---until now that is.At first I thought these seemed a little firm. And Expensive. But they have proven themselves to me and my wife. I used to use two pillows and I spent the night repositioning them and I still woke up with neck tightness, and spasm.Now, I rarely have any problems, and would never go back to cheaper alternatives. They seem to be waring very well also. They are not losing their firmness, I guess that's the inner pillow. Oh yea----did i mention there's a pillow within a pillow, I think thats what makes it work so well, give good support and not feel like your head is laying on a rock,"
4,Don't go cheap on down pillows,This is a great compliment to the Pacific Coast 4 down comforter. We had purchased down pillows before and they were relatively inexpensive and it showed. The feathers worked their way through and they smelled. The Pacific Coast 4 pillows are great. Extremely comfortable and don't scratch. Spend a little more on better quality. You won't be disappointed.
3,Firm? I think not.,"I received this pillow and was upset when it arrived. It was nowhere near my standards of firmness. When I put my head on it, my head was touching the mattress. I was expecting something a little more stiff. I guess the down pillows aren't like the old fashioned feather pillows I am used to."
1,Over priced; poor value for the money.,"Originally I had purchased 2 of these pillow from bed bath and beyond -- I loved them! After about 3 years it was time to replace them, even though they supposedly had a 5 year warranty. Bed Bath and Beyond no longer carries this brand as I found out.So then I ordered 2 queen of their very expensive pillows from their website... it's only been 1 year and they won't even fluff now.Needless to say I will look for another down pillow company with a much better track record and value."
2,not firm,"I have been using this pillow for 7 months, and it went from being medium to soft. It is wonderfully soft, if that's what you want, but I wanted firm (I'm a side sleeper). I think the packaging said it has a lifetime guarantee--I'm going to try and see if the company will honor it. Maybe what I really want is a feather pillow with less down for more firmness?"
5,The Only Way,I feel Darrell Klassen is the Greatest teacher this game has ever seen. This game has been over complicated by so many books and videos but to get this video is all you need. Golf is an easy game. Get it and see for yourself. Trust me.
3,Great Story Line,"I enjoyed this movie from what I could watch from it. I got a poor bootleg copy and it goes in and out of focus the entire movie on all the DVDs. I tried watching this on a standard DVD, blu ray dvd, and my computer dvd with the same results. I gave the buyer a good rating before I watched the first DVD. BEWARE of bootleg/poor quality copies of this DVD and I DON'T recommend buying this from the buyer I bought it from"
1,No purchase/delivery to UK from US,"This company would not do a transaction on this book from the US to the UK. So I will given a refund.Fortunately, however, I was able to get hold of a copy from elsewhere.But I should have been told this before the transaction took place - not happy."
2,"Errors, incomplete info, overly-ambitious effort","My experience and knowledge is limited to the original comic art and underground comics sections, though I wouldn't bill myself as a great authority on either. However, even I can spot dozens of factual errors in both sections, as well as many surprises found among the values given for comix. The well-known first underground comic, ""Adventures of Jesus"" is not even listed! Granted, Underground Comix are a very complex area of comic book history and collecting, having a variety of printers and publishers with the various editions. His guide should at least list all printings (in the interest of documentation, even if their value is minimal), and add more historical info on significant titles, including creators. I won't even go into his lack of intelligable writing ability. Surprisingly poor effort from an accomplished expert. All in all, a frustratingly incomplete and ameteurish ""Waist!."" Get the out-of-print Jay Kennedy guide instead."
3,The Comic Art Price Guide (2nd edition) by Jerry Weist (ISBN: 0970092202),"Nestled within this August 2000 guide to original comic art is a small section on underground comix, approximately less than 1/6th of the book, which was intended be a 'market check' and supplement to Kennedy (1982) for a subset of popular underground titles (e.g. Freak Brothers, Zap Comix, Air Pirates, Gothic Blimp Works, etc.). Strengths: first attempt by anyone to capture increase in values for high grade and scarce underground comix, good essay on UGs and importance of Zap Comix #1. Weaknesses: no information on printing determination; only small subset of UGs, errors/omissions."
3,"Loved it, BUT...","Very entertaining show, but a bit pricey for only two disks with 10 episodes.$12.99 would have been a more appropriate price."
1,The worst J2EE book available,"Overall, I feel as if the author must have skimmed a number of J2EE books, and then, borrowing from these sources, compiled a hodge-podge of spotty, dated, inaccurate, and often misleading advice. Please do not waste your money on this monstrosity. If you are curious to see just how bad this book is, the book is available for free in PDF format at theserverside.com (you can also find a more detailed list of the problems, and some additional reviews thers)FYI, the best books I have read, that cover the topics that this book was intended to cover, are: Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development (a.k.a. the J2EE Bible), by Rod Johnson and Applying UML and Patterns, by Craig Larman. Although these books are not free, they both contain invaluable knowledge for aspiring J2EE Architects."
4,On time and in perfect condition.,I received the book when expected and in perfect conditions. Very interesting book for a very reasonable price.
2,weak center bolt and aluminum,I received this as a gift and it worked well but felt wobbly. When mowing the lawn I tapped it with the lawn mower and the aluminum at the base cracked. Now I have it tied to a tree until I get a better mail box.
2,April Fools,"Haven't assembled this yet, looks OK. Just got back from the locksmith. All the parts / pieces / directions and KEYS are shipped in the box where the mail is securely stored. And it was locked. No skinny hands or coat hook tricks would do the trick. Aggravating."
2,mailbox,"Check this out! This is a pretty good item, except, the key and instructions are locked inside!!!!! I contacted Amazon.com about this and they said this is common practice for Solar Group. They've gotten many calls about this issue. We tried calling Solar Group directly but their offices are closed. All we could do was laugh at the sheer stupidity. A mulitmillion dollar company actually locks the keys and instructions as a normal practice."
4,Pedestal Maibox,"This pedestal mailbox was pretty much what I expected when I ordered it. However, two warnings to potential buyers. First, one must make a concrete base to anchor the mailbox, whether it's for a porch or in the ground. I wanted it to put on my porch. I didn't expect to have to make a concrete base. Add another $50 or so to make the concrete base. I was unable to find a vendor willing to make the concrete base so I ended up doing it myself. Second, putting the mailbox together is no piece of cake. Unless you're handy with tools you may need help putting it togther. The finished product is nice and hopefully will last for years to come."
3,Too expensive,Just found today that Lowes has the same unit for less than $140. You may want check that place out before you buy this at $199.
1,GOING BACK NOW!,The mailbox arrived in time to be returned immediately....the problem? NO KEY!!! The key may be locked inside the mailbox with other parts but it and the other parts are totally inaccessible. What a hassle....on top of the hassle I have trying to have items shipped to me from Amazon without having a mailbox in front of my house. This was my solution but it seems I struck out again with Amazon.
4,not bad,"The little unit works pretty well.A couple of things they don't tell you...1. Although the device looks like a standard usb storage device when connected via the USB, you apparently cannot copy mp3 files directly to the device's memory. They have to be ""encrypted"" using the supplied cheezy moodlogic software. Music files cannot apparently be copied from the device to your PC. Big brother again I guess. This does not seem to hold true with the mmc/sd card slot.2. For decent FM reception you must use a small 2.5"" supplied FM antenna that is screwed into a threaded slot on the left earpiece. On my unit it's in a matching grey color and stays reasonably flush in the direction of the headband.The unit shoulds good and is indeed quite wirefree. Records FM to internal memory, which is a neat feature."
2,dashed hopes,"I had such high hopes but this baby is going back. It is a very tempting item for the obvious reasons but here is the lowdown:- As headphones go, it is heavy, *very* uncomfortable and poorly built.- The entire product screams "" I was built in China!""; plastic has rough edges, the controls are clunky (you move 5 notches if you only want to move one, etc.)- the transfer software only works for 100 songs and it's three-o for the ""full"" product; free plug-in did not recognize the player after 45 minutes. I was unable to transfer files and I write software for a living.-- As I said, the headphone aren't comfortable (and I love back-of-the-head ones in general) so unless you'd buy a pair of nice lambskin gloves that are two sizes small just because they look nice...Stay away, you have been warned."
1,"usable, but overpriced","This type of player is absolute must for me, as I put a lot of miles on my bike on weekends. I want music to last for hours and don't want any wires. I used Now Evolution 32MB similar to this player, loved it with exception of limited storage. I tried to purchase Now Evolution NP256, but couldn't find it anywhere! Mojo 1 is the only other option available, which I was reluctant to go for, but had no choice. I was disappointed, when after several attempts to copy my MP3 file directly to internal memory, I realized that I have to use MoodLogic software (supplied) to transfer files, which encrypts them. What a hastle!External memory is OK for direct coping."
4,The only Regency romance I've read more than once.,This is a surprisingly charming book. The heroine is fine but the hero is the interesting character as an unabashed rake with a secret heart of gold. It's an offbeat regency but well worth the read.
5,Heartbreaking,"I found it interesting that people who purchased this book also purchased Alice Seybold's The Lovely Bones. While both are lovely in their own way, this book is full of the grit of reality, while of course Seybold's is the cotton candy world of the hereafter. Personally, I prefer Glatt's vision, though I thoroughly enjoyed both books. Glatt's work is stark and honest, yet human and infinitely forgiving. I highly recommend this book."
4,Not for everyone.,"Beatles purists will absolutely hate this. Most of the songs are completely unrecognizable from the originals. After listening to this, you'll finally appreciate what Ringo brought to the band (ok, not Ringo, but the fact that they had a live drummer and not a machine).On the other hand, if you've grown up with techno, house and trance and have not been familiarized with the ""Fab-Four"" this may be a place to start. Even with the instruments and vocals changed (except for the song on the cd that is only an instrumental- which is strange because the words were the best part), the lyrics are still as moving from strange mouths as ever.Finally, if you do get this, have an open mind and give it a chance. I would suggest listening to the samples above to get an idea of what you're in for. Be warned that most of the remixes are a lot longer than the originals."
3,Groovy Groovy Guru,"Psychedelic Yogi is just a ... groovy groovy guru. Oops that's Donovan, not the Beatles. This collection is enjoyable, especially when I want to ""relax turn off my mind and float downstream...."" Play it late night in a dark room while watching a flickering candle and you will enjoy it greatly. If you try to put all your cognitive powers to work analyzing each track individually, you'll have mixed feelings about the CD. First track is definitely the best, but all are fine. Dig it. Or dig a pony."
1,OMG.... What the $*%#& is this trash?,"I got this as a Christmas present and thought, ""Okay.... I love the Beatles, so this must be something new"".Words can't describe what I heard on my stereo! I sat there in utter shock trying to understand what the heck these kids were trying to do to the classic Beatles songs! I hit the next track and listened for 10-15 seconds and still got horrified at what they did or were trying to do. Hit the next track, etc... Next track, etc...****THE WHOLE CD IS A COMPLETE PIECE OF TRASH****OMG, I wish there was a way to return the CD. Yes, everyone, it is THAT bad!!! I won't even put it on the shelf with all my other CD's. The only thing I can suggest is donating the CD to a rod and gun club and let someone use the CD for skeet shooting!!!!!"
1,John Would Not Be Pleased,"This is total trash! P-U!!! This drecht doesn't even deserve a 1-star rating. Yuck!!! This CD is nothing more than a dreadful mixture of very weak electronica, poor vocals, some horrible chamber music; and medicore hip hop. This CD is a gigantic slap in the face to the Beatles and a gigantic insult to their legacy to music and culture. To sum up this CD: It is Dull, uninspiring, and uninteresting. Save your money! Don't waste it on this piece of garbage. If John were with us today, he'd be mad as hell after listening to his music being butchered by a bunch of low rate, two-bit flunkies making noise and calling it music."
1,not what I expected nor wanted,"I heard a Dance remix of Because and [because] that song is so hard to locate, I thought that it was on this CD because of the artists name for some reason. NOTThis is more like New Age than Dance. I am disappointed in the music and also [because] I now have to spend more money on the one song that I really want. The fine print inside the insert says it has nothing to do with any Beatles actual performances, nor Apple Records. The song I want is a remix of John Lennon's vocals, the original intro of the song and then magically [re-grooved], resampled and remixed with a 21'st century electronica / dance beat."
5,Hilarious,Even if you have not worked or dealt with the British civil service (or their colonial scions) the comedy transcends the situation. Politics as practiced by the British or any civil society produces its own brand of comedy of errors to be enjoyed by all!
2,the core size is smaller than advertized Inner Diameter,"This is a huge problem if you are concerned about performance.Anyone can make a smaller pipe and get ""muffled"" sound.The idea should be Inner Diameter to match the Innter Diameter of the core.Thrush has failed to do so.If you need correct Inner Diameter, step up in size of Thrush muffler."
3,Sound?,"I am hoping for a louder, deeper, noticeable tone than the other aftermarket muffler I had installed before I bought this one. I have not put it on yet, but when I do, I'll update my review. (I am going by what others are saying so far.) Why not a 5*? I don't particularly care for the 'Break-in' time I was told about. I don't believe that there is such a thing anymore, but just in case, I cannot go the whole 5*'s until I have it on. Otherwise, I think I will enjoy it very much! (Which DEFINETLY Will Deserve 5*'s+)"
1,Big pass.,"The spatula end itself is very pliable and thin on the edge, which makes it pretty much useless for stirring anything except liquids. Worse, after a period of months, it decided to break off small pieces in a stew I was stirring. The two-piece design makes it difficult to clean. And it smells terrible - there's a rubbery smell that tastes even worse, and I can't imagine it's not transferring some of that bitter taste to the food.I got a sturdy one-piece silicon spatula (coated all around) to replace it, and it's working so much better."
1,very disappointed,"I really wanted to like this thing. Friends had touted them, so I got one. It worked good the first few times I used it, then the edge started coming off in little chunks. Now it looks like mice have been nibbling on the edge, it's totally unuseable. The worst was when I was stirring gumbo with it, and had to keep picking little red specks of silicone out of the food. I dont think I abused it, just used it for its intended purpose. Otherwise, I did like it...maybe if you dont use it in hot pans, but it's spozed to be good to 600 degrees..."
2,Works great... for 3 months,"I picked up this spatula based on a recommendation from Cooks Illustrated, who is always spot-on with recommending products that work great, and often at a good value. This product was a good value and did indeed work great... for 3-4 months. After moderate use (a couple times a week for those 3 months), small fragments of the silicone started breaking off in whatever I was making at the time. This is unacceptable, and I won't be ordering another Tovolo any time soon."
2,"Started out great, now decomposing!","I agree with some of the other reviewers. I bought this based on the CI recommendation. It initially is nice, with the right level of firmness and shape to the blade, but after a few months, pieces of the silicone start breaking off in little chunks on the edges. Not cool. It now looks like a rat attacked my spatula for lunch. It has only been handwashed. Find another spatula unless you want to replace this one every few months."
1,Terrible!,"Like other reviewers, I bought this spatula upon a recommendation from Cooks Illustrated. I also was very happy with it initially. It has a nice handle and scrapes well but after a few months of use (never in high temperatures), pieces started chipping off. Very quickly several more pieces came off and I threw it out! I used it almost exclusively for batters and doughs and always hand-washed it. It's garbage. Don't waste your money..."
1,Bad product - Pieces break off and blade separates from handle.,"As noted in many other reviews, pieces of the blade break off and the blade separates from the handle. Tovolo makes a lot of silicon products. Not buying any of their brand anymore."
1,Breaks quickly,"I received this item as a gift, and while it looks very nice, the silicone chipped off and broke into food I was making on the 3rd or 4th use. Went and bought the Rubbermaid pro spatulas as a replacement, and while they are ugly, they are easily the best spatulas I've ever used."
3,Wears out quickly,"I bought two of these spatulas and use them frequently. Unfortunately, one has already become unusable due to cracks in the silicone, which eventually caused a large section to tear off. I've reverted to using my Oxo spatulas because they are far more durable."
3,A couple of minor flaws,"Terrific, with 2 small caveats:1. Its heft is nice, but the handle is so heavy that the thing feels a bit out of balance to me.2. Its edge has suffered a small cut or tear, perhaps from being put in the dishwasher next to a knife(?) Too bad it couldn't be tougher and more resistant to a bit of abuse.Other than that, great (so far). Even with its faults, it's my favorite spatula."
1,Very Dissapointed- Poor Quality.,"I purchased this item based on ""America's Test Kitchen"" recommendation. With the first use, the silicon on the tip of the spoon chipped and it has been chipping since. Considering the silicon can't withstand sauteing onions, this product has poor quality. Fishing for silicon pieces in your food is no fun!"
1,Spatula arrived with a piece of the tip missing.,"I can not say how well it would have worked, as I received it with a piece of the tip missing and it seemed to be losing another piece next to the lost piece. If a piece could come off before even being used, I would not want to use it for anything that I was going to eat. The factory in China where this was made needs to be told to step up their quality control. I can just imagine using it to cook a red sauce and a piece of the slim tip coming off into the sauce to be digested unknowingly . A fellow had a similar problem with the blue spatula, but I decided to give it try based on a popular cooking mag., I wonder what color they used or if the factory/company changed something for this spatula to have gotten such praise."
1,from 5 stars to 1 star,"Like a few others before me, I picked this item because of its recommendation from cooks illustrated, and was extremely happy with its shape and function. But, mine too has started falling apart. The tip of my spatula has rips and chunks missing which I only hope wound up in the dishwasher instead of my food. I know I'm abusive with my kitchen tools, but I purchased a set of Pinzon silicone spatulas months before this one and they have stood up to the exact same conditions and show absolutely no wear. Even though I enjoy using my Tovolo much more... I can't recommend anyone purchasing this item."
1,Big disappointment,"I agree with another reviewer who mentioned this scraper chipping. I have used it only a very few times, but already there are several small pieces missing from the edge. Had very high hopes for this, and it is nice in several ways: long handle, great shape; but the chipping is simple unacceptable."
2,Disappointing,"I was very excited to use this spatula as it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated and it worked well for a few months. The weight and design are wonderful, however, both of the ones I have bought now have nics and chips on the tip and are no longer usable for fear of pieces falling into the batter or dough. As much as I like them, I would not recommend them."
2,too heavy,choose this brand for the lower price. Seems well made but had to return. The handle is too heavy for what I use this item for. I replaced it with the Rubbermade brand.
1,Disintegrates,"I just have to echo other reviews regarding this spatula. I bought one and it soon started chipping away, disintegrating, within just a dozen or so uses. I do not recommend and, apparently, many others have had this problem so not unique."
5,Great Kitching Tool,This was recommended by America's Test Kitchen and I can see why. I ordered two and will probably buy more.
2,Great expectations - disappointing results,"I had great expectations for this spatula: metal handle, silicone head - I felt the combination would be easy to clean and maintain, and truly heat-proof.My expectations were mostly realized. The limitation I had not realized was that the head was quite a bit smaller than expected, and that, because of its softness, it was not quite as easy to handle material as I thought it would be. Overall, however, it had quite some value.Unfortunately, the head started falling apart within 5-6 months of purchase. After 1.5 years of very episodic use, I took it off of my frequently used set. I finally threw it away today. In the end it did not work out for me. Not recommended."
1,Really Bad Purchase,"I bought this item along with a silicone spoon from the same company. The spoon is a real champion and I actually recommend it; this item is a different story. Much like others here, the flat end of the spatula became brittle and essentially began to disintegrate after just a few uses. As I was cleaning up after a gathering at my house, I was mortified to see that a guest had had to pick out a small piece of 'spatula' from the banana pudding I had served them! I take a measure of pride in my cooking and presentation, and I was aghast. I'm not one to return things if I just have minor problems with an item, but this one went back to the store without hesitation."
1,Rubber broke off into food during 1st use,"Although this was recommended by Cook's Illustrated, the durability of this product is terrible. I was making rice crispy treats and the thin edges of this spatula broke off into the food; had to throw this away after 1 use."
2,"I loved this spatula, until I saw chunks of it in my risotto","Everything about this spatula was perfect, the weight, the design of the actual tip, and the color stood out among the other utensils next to the stove. One day I was making risotto, which cooks over low heat mind you, when I noticed bright red bits of silicone in the rice. I looked at the tip of the spatula and sure enough, two chunks came off. What was once the spatula to end all spatulas was now useless. I guess I'll be contacting Tovolo on a regular schedule to get replacements until they cut me off, because the shape and weight of this is just too perfect for me to go back to some easily stained bargain bin spatula, I'll just try avoiding ever contacting any heat. With any luck, I'll get one that doesn't end up garnishing my food."
1,Disintegrates over time,"This spatula was great until chunks started falling off into the pot. I only hand washed this and used it for stirring food but after 6 months it is in pieces. Chunks came off and also major ""rips"" in the silicone appeared rending it useless. It is now in the trash."
3,Absolutely fantastic - at first,"I replaced a drawer full of spatulas that were all driving me crazy. Everything from... handles retaining water from the dishwasher... to heads having too much contour and being impossible to scrape clean on the edge...The handle is very comfortable and long enough to reach the bottom of my mixer's bowl easily... without being so long as to be cumbersome or unwieldy.The head is smooth and well shaped. With both a curved and straight side, it's suitable for scraping down just about any surface, and because it's so well-shaped, it's easy to clean it off at the edge of the bowl.Edit 1/29/2011:I removed 2 stars from this rating because of durability issues. Both spatulas have taken to shedding bits of the silicone head, so have been thrown away. I replaced them with a couple of far less attractive but much more durable spatulas."
2,Milan Mattress by Amercian Furniture Alliance,"The frame is okay, The mattress for the first month was okay, but it does mush down and gets lumpy and you can feel the springs. I understand this Milan mattress is no longer sold by them, but they do stand behind their product and will send a replacement mattress. The problem is, that how long will the replacement last when it had problems in the first place. You're kinda out over $200 on this set."
3,OK if you don't yet have your bandsaw,"More of a discussion about different kinds of bandsaws and benefits of various features, than it a book about what you can do with a bandsaw. Wish I'd read it before I bought one, but now that I have it, I'd much rather learn about all the neat things I can do with it!"
4,Good reference book,"This book gives you a general background for using a bandsaw. I am an experieced woodshop worker, but have never owned a bandsaw until now. There are several aspects to using a bandsaw that are not evident compared to table saws or miter saws. The book is well illustrated with photos and drawings. I recommend it."
2,A 2.5 star book,"I was definetly not impressed by this book, not the caliber of the Table Saw Book or The Router Book. Not a lot of information that most woodworkers familar with a hammer and pliers did not already know. I would suggest the book be re-written with some added useful information. Jrl"
3,"A good reference, not indispensible",There's not really anything about bandsaws here that you can't learn for free on the internet. However it is handy to have them all in once place and it does have some nice reference facts and some jigs you can make for your saw.
4,The Bandsaw Book by Lonnie Bird,Exceptional help for beginners and intermediate bandsaw users. I added a few tricks to my tool box the day I read this book.
5,Love it,"I had gotten a new bandsaw for christmas and I was a bit on the stumped side on what to do, since it had been 20 years since the last time I had used a bandsaw. Starting looking for a good book and found this one. I am glad I got it, gave the good headstart I needed especially with things like tuning, jig making, and overall knowledge of this particular piece of equipment."
5,Must read if looking for first bandsaw,I bought this book because I've been in the market for my first bandsaw for a few months. I've been researching the topic a lot and came across a recommendation for this book in a forum somewhere. Given Amazon's great price I thought what they heck. I found this book to be very informative and pointed out a lot of things I should be looking at when determining which saw to buy that I had not though of. It did this without knocking any brands or given slanted praise to any brand either which I really liked. I don't really like taking a recommendation from an author who recommends a brands that sponsors him. Definitely worth the money and the time.
5,The bible of bandsaws,"I bought the bandsaw and figured I better have a book to help me along. I bought this book with the hopes it would help. It has and will some more in the future.I did find some of the information redundant as to what was written in the owners manual. But, there are great sections on how to tune up your saw, jigs, projects and a whole lot more. This book is in my shop with me and I find myself referring to it.I would recommend for both novice and seasoned woodworkers. There is just a lot of good useful information."
4,Really a good read,"Lonnie has included most everything on a bandsaw, and has produced an informative book, and very readable. Learned a few things, and will keep this one on my woodworking book shelf. I have a Powermatic 14"" Bandsaw, and I did change 2 things on it since I bought it. 1. The good fence with a much better one: Kreg. 2. The guides, that had rusted after 3 months, to Carter Guides. I have yet to add the Riser. Wish he would have addressed this a little more."
2,Very basic,"The book is good for someone just learning, and as a primer on blade selection,although I would not agree with all the blade information. It completely lacks depth. I recommend getting it at the library and spending money on a more comprehensive approach. The endless repetition in the book was annoying. It could probably have been better-wtitten in one third of the pages."
4,Good Music For A Bad Cause,"Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three is a case of good music being used to support a bad cause. The music, contributed by the likes of Henry Rollins and other leading musicians is pretty good on the whole. However, there is quite a bit of pro-West Memphis 3 stuff on this CD and all of the profits from sales of this CD goes to help legal efforts on behalf of the WM 3.This would be a good thing if there was good reason to believe that the WM 3 really were framed for a crime that they commit. Problem is the pro-WM 3 material on this CD contains many factual errors and fails to make a persuasive case to believe in the innocence of the WM 3.If you want to listen to this good music, then the thing to do is to look for it at your local public library, secondhand music shop or borrow it from a friend. Don't let your good money go to support a bad cause like the West Memphis 3."
2,what cause?,"it is such a shame that these artists want to gather around three CONVICTED killers saying they were wrongly punished! regardless of what the rest of the country thinks, we're not so ignorant to wrongly punish people in the South because we want to! get a grip. little kids were VICIOUSLY murdered and musicians want to say that's okay. that's what's wrong with America today: NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS!!! wake up America, don't support the WM3! what if it was your son that was killed?"
4,Great Family Camera,"I bought this camera mainly because I am a parent and I wanted to have something that would be able to capture the milestones in my children's lives (ie. school plays, soccer games etc.) This camera was perfect for me because of the zoom feature. I am able to focus on my child's face from all the way across the room, and I love it!My only complaint is that whenever the zoom option is used, there is a lot of red eye accompanied with the picture. Also the pictures are a bit more grainy than I would have expected it to be. Overall though, I am happy with this purchase. Great camera for the price."
4,A great camera with a lot of features for beginners,"Although this camera is very user friendly, there's a lot of features that a beginner or amateur may not understand. We're still learning what the various symbols mean on the LCD and how to adjust things for different lighting situations. THere's a few really simple settings, but they aren't perfect so the more advanced adjustments are useful. Be prepared to read the manual front to back to really know your camera!"
4,Versatile Camera with Great Image Quality,"I have used this camera for 3+ years. I have found it to be quite reliable. The light weight is a big plus for an avid backpacker like myself. This camera has been through some terrible conditions and has performed consistently well over thousands of images. The image quality is quite striking for a 6mp camera. i have produced some very nice 5 x 7 prints. Pros: lightweight, reliable, well built, extensive manual controls, excellent zoom, good IS. Cons: limited ISO range, small sensor, low res lcd, slow burst mode. At the time I purchased this camera it was the latest superzoom on the market and was very competitive with others. In fact, I believe it to have been the best 3 years ago. If you want consistent reliable workhorse. An excellent choice."
5,Panasonic DMC-FZ7 Digital Camera,I ordered the above camera and received it in excellent shipping time. The camera is everything and more that I had hoped for in a camera. I like the 12 Times Optical Image real well. It has a nice sized viewer on back. It is very simple to operate and I am just enjoying it tremendously.
4,Good camera at low ISO,"This was the first Panny FZ I bought (have bought an FZ18 since). It is a good little camera at 80 or 100 ISO. After that, IQ starts to drop from noise and noise reduction. No RAW to help either.Lens is very sharp and fast to focus. Exposure is a little overblown (dial in some -ev).All in all, not a bad camera for its time."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I bought this camera to replace my canon POS, because it has a lot of pro features and was - well, cheap. And you get what you pay for: the lens and the zoom are great (Leica), the features overflowing; but *alas* even at ISO 80 it's a really noisy image. Also, it tends to shoot too bright, so I have to underexpose by just a little. And no RAW, so no pro images.A great trainer camera for a newbie exploring to see if a pro-cam is worthwhile, and I don't know if the Fz8 or 50 has a better sensor chip, but this one has kind of a crappy sensor chip, definite pixellation at full-sized without any tweaks. I spend a lot of time in Photoshop these days, and will likely replace it with a Canon instead of another Lumix."
2,Disappointing results,"I bought this camera because of image stabilization and 12X zoom because we are going on a trip to costa rica and I wanted to be able to get good shots of animals.I've been trying the camera out and am really disappointed. I may leave it at home and use my Nikon. it doesn't have image stabilization and only has a 4X zoom, but the pictures are far superior. I'm finding that the colors are coming out very dark, and the contrast is poor. I also find that despite the image stabilization, the pictures aren't as clear as what I have gotten with my Nikon.I'll be checking other websites to look for tips but would appreciate any helpful hints readers can give me."
5,Best digital yet,"Great for important pics and for on the fly burst snapshots. I love this camera. My Website pics will improve as well as business shots of my tree experiments and landscape jobs.Bought a 1 Gig chip $ [...] here on Amazon, how cheap can it get)for it as I was runnung out of room on my 128 mb chip. Been playing with exposure times and light levels which I'd never been able to do on my other digitals."
5,User friendly,"This camera is very user friendly with relatively easy to navigate controls. The optical zoom provides nice shooting flexibility. A small, but sweet feature is the reproduced shutter sound that makes it seem less digital."
4,Panasonic DMC-FZ7S Camera,"I've been happy with the camera, its pictures in general, the great zoom features and the number of picture I can take before charging the battery. My previous camera would need to be charged or the batteries replaced halfway thru a family event and this camera does not."
4,Great little camera!,"I puchased this camera after looking at other more expensive digital cameras. This one fits my needs just right. Planning on taking it on overseas trips and it lightweight and small enough to fit in a regular purse or tote, without being cheaply made. Love the larger screen it has for viewing.The battery that comes with it lasts long enough for most regular shoots, but I recommend getting an extra battery or two if you plan on using it on a long vacation just in case. I bought a battery for half the price online.I would of given the camera 5 stars, but I found it a little small to use for my hands. The grip is slighlty small for ""gripping"". Overall all though it is a 5 star camera for the price and the quality."
3,Great features - but a big disappointment,After a lot of research I chose to buy this camera as a replacement to my old HP digital camera that was dropped. It was only after many photos did I specifically look for help on a lot of unfocussed photos. I was VERY disappointed to see that this was a MAJOR fault of this camera that is not readily public knowledge. It cannot focus properly above an ISO setting of 100. I would not recommend this camera for any photography enthusiast due to this problem.
4,The camera is great.,"I love it! I have been taking all kinds of pictures(birds, insects, flowers, sunsets and landscapes, people and just some creative pics) with it and they turn out great. The booklet that comes with the camera is extremely useful and helpful. I strongly recommend this camera for anyone. Thanks"
5,Great Camera,"Excellent camera! This is my second digital and it is not disappointing. I decided to upgrade from my 3x optical fujifilm, which served me well for many years. 3x is pitiful and surprisingly alot of new cameras are just that. Was close to staying with fujifilm but the model had a small lcd and 10x optical. The big screen, 6 mp and great optical zoom won me over. naturally with any digital camera a 1gb memory card is more than enough and an extra battery must be purchased. picture quality is excellent and very few times have i had a blury picture. fast picture times are a welcomed change from my old camera, too. if you know what you are doing there are MANY features and they are not difficult to use. there is also a simple mode. software was nothing too spectacular but thats not in question here. i will submit a picture too. if you want a good camera with a healthy zoom and megapixels this has to be on your list, plus it has excellent value."
4,Owned one for a few weeks,"There is much to learn about this camera so this is an early review. Absolutely delighted with results - well what do you expect from Leica lenses? My early outdoor shots were rather blue, read the manual, checked the white balance and changed from tungstan to outdoors - result great. The menu is really intuitive. So if the results are off, check your settings. Only 4 stars because I need to learn more and also check reliability but for now very pleased with this camera."
5,BIGGGG step up over the terrific FZ5 except in pixels,"I loved the FZ5 but up'ed to the FZ7 not for 1 MP but the bigger LCD. To my surprise, I find the menu and button layout improved and intuitive. I can't compare this to similar Sony and Canon offerings but this camera is for sure smaller and very light. The image stab is unbelieveable..when I'm hiking at 8 to 12 K feet and stop to take a pix, I'm breathing hard and can see the viewfinder jump in time with my pulse. No prob, sqeeze off a shot at ISO 100 and the image is crisp. This should have been an 8 MP camera if Panasonic wanted to really wanted offer an ""upgrade""...too bad, but for me 6 MP works."
2,doesn't focus-macro dark,"We have had this camera for 3 years now and I have, since day one, had trouble getting it to focus properly in many situations. Macro shots haven't worked at all for me. the macro setting makes everything dark and when you stand back and zoom in to try to get a macro, it often won't find the focus. It has taken ok photos much of the time. Put for its price and supposed class it isn't all that great. Our other digital camera is a much older cheaper sony cybershot and it sometimes takes better photos than this one."
4,Excelente Opcion.,"Muy buena camara, Buen zoom y excelente para captar objetos en movimientos. claro esta que no es la mejor camara, pero tienes muy buenas caracteristicas por el precio que pagas, es un buen ejemplo de bueno y economico."
1,Not Happy at All,"I bought this camera after my Sony Mavica died, and am now wishing I had bought the Cybershot instead. I have tried is several different modes to take a good picture, most are quite blurry. The image stabilization seems to make them more so! The camera will only take 12x zoom in 6 MP mode, and you better know your way around a camera to read the manual. I am going to try to resell and buy myself a Cybershot, I don't want to be a professional to get a decent shot."
3,A cool game gone bad!,"When I first saw the somewhat stupid ads for this game, I thought it looked pretty good anyway, so I got it. At first the game seemed fun, but after a while, I felt like it was a let down. The competition is very tough, and you can't go out side of the edges of the road, like in Crusin' USA or World. (Not to mean that Crusin'World is not a great game. Buy it!) The weapons are weak, cornering is tough, and the 4-player mode leaves out tons of detail! Although it can be fun, and some of my friends bought it right away after playing mine, I recomend that you buy this game... if you like frustration!"
1,Baad!!!,"This game is rather BAD! The graphics are lacking and the music, well, don't get me started on the music! It's like some kind of wannabe techno. Take my advice, DON'T BUY IT!!!!"
5,Excellent product!!!!!,"I had several problems with other memories because my motherboard is not so new, but has the DDR slots and takes up to 2 GB in DDR memories. I bought one but didn't work, i don't know why. So my friends recommended me to buy a corsair and so i did. It couldn't be better, it's an excellent product with outstanding performance and the price is exactly right.....you really couldn't get more for less...."
5,Works excellent,"The memory works excellent, i install it without problems and until now the computer is working great"
2,Silurians is so slow!,"I went into The Silurians, hoping for a good story. I came out with a bad taste in my mouth.The Silurians is terribly slow, so slow in fact, that I actually fell asleep while watching. The monsters are poorly realised, the characters sad and one-dimensional. I even disliked the Brigadier in this one!So go for my advice. Get Inferno!"
3,"""It's the invasion of the bad special effects!""","I suppose that Dr. Who and the Silurians is a nice episode, but REALLY, I know they didn't have much to work with, but the silurians are one of the worst designed monsters in Doctor Who! Don't buy it if you don't want to laugh at the main villian every time it appears."
5,Superb!,Dr Who and the Silurians is undoubtly the best Jon Pertwee story. It sees the debuet of surley the best Dr Who monsters ever(Silurians)who reapear in Warriors of the deep. The story is gripping. The actors are the best and costumes and acting is superb. I would strongly recomend any one to buy this classic Dr Who andventure!
5,She love's it,bought it for my 5 year old daughter. She is enjoying this as one of her Christmas gifts. Thank you
4,Wildest cartoon ever,I would always watch Courage with my kids. When I saw it was available I had to watch it. I named my dog after him!
4,"Great ""classic"" cartoon!","I used to watch this cartoon when I was little. It was entertaining back then and still is today. I enjoy the older cartoons verses the new ones that Cartoon Network now shows. Not only was this entertaining, but it was also funny (to a certain degree)."
5,Great!,Great product! Was a Christmas present. She loved it. Is a good product for anyone who likes this series of animation.
5,So funny!,My 9 year old loves these cartoons. She loves the idea that Courage gets so scared all the time! Fun for her and the adults in the house!
4,Glad to finally own this great show!,"To know this show is to love it. Weird and odd as it was for a kids' television network, the show has always impressed me. It is truly appropriate for all audiences, and will please any child or child at heart, as long as they have a love for the strange!This release is pretty no-frills, which saddens me a bit but is no surprise: people really just need the episodes themselves, not much else. The set gives you 1-13 (each episode has two stories), simply packaged.I'd have loved to get an inserted booklet or special features section, but c'est la vie.Just glad to finally have Courage in my collection!"
3,london bridge,"actually the rating is for the translation.when i saw ""london bridge"" (guignol's band II), i was ecstatic as i had read all of celine's work available in english before it had come out (even searching out the then-out-of-print ""north""-""castle to castle""-""rigadon"" trilogy).to my dismay i did not care for it as much as i had hoped.for me (and others may have a different experience), i did not like the tone of the translation (but i did not like the translation of guignol's band I either). for me, london bridge felt self-conciously hip.i much prefer mannhiem's translations of celine's work. perhaps i have come to equate his tone with celine's.i think that journey and installment plan (both 5-star ratings)are better places to start with celine, then moving on to the afore-mentioned trilogy (4.5 stars each). if completeness is needed, i'd move on to the guignol's band series.others may have a different viewpoint."
4,My son's favorite toys,"My 3 year old got this for Christmas last year, and it's the one gift that he's played with consistantly all year. The carrying case has plenty of room for Bob's helpers, and it's helpful to have one place to keep all the trucks and their magetic loads. The trucks are sturdy and have survived many hours of playtime no worse for the wear. The only thing that keeps me from giving it all 5 stars is that it comes with ONE ramp to attach to the construction site on the back of the case. Two would have made more sense, so you could drive up onto it and back down the other side. This hasn't stopped my son from playing with it all the time, though, so it's a minor detail."
5,Hilarious True Life Comedy,"This mini-series is based on the autobiography of famed naturalist Gerald Durrell and centers on his childhood years on the Mediterranean island of Corfu. It is filled with his impressions as a boy of his very eccentric family, the Greek friends including the immortal Spiro and Dr. Stephanides, and the flora and fauna of the island.I thoroughly recommend it as a clean, entertaining, hilarious and poignant family movie."
5,"A wonderful, conforting, helpful book!","""In Life and Death: The Shaping of Faith"" is a well written, moving book that deals with issues of grief and loss and brings them together with ones personal search for faith during those hard times. It is an important book to read if you have experienced a loss because it brings you through the process of grief with the realization that it is only through our dark times that our faith and religion are fully tested. But the book is not limited to just those that have experienced a significant loss, it is written for all, as the book brings to life the tenuous place we all live in - somewhere between life and death - and the beauty that tested faith brings to us in the forms of comfort and healing. The book, through the process of dealing with grief, lends the reader to a deeper appreciation of life. Excellent, profound, must read!"
2,If you're obssesd...,"I just bought this and for $$ it's not worth it. All of the extras just include new scenery items. There arn't any new rides either. What they call new rides are just the same tracks with different cars. Want new food stands? well there arn't any! However, for those who want more pre-made games, this add on has a few. Overall if you're an obssesd fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 than I guess it's worth the $$$."
5,WHAT are they all talking about?!?!?!,This is a great game!!! Come on! There is WAY more scenary and are WAY more rides to play with! Some are complaining about the number of scenarios but the big thing is that you can create your own scenario and pack it with TONS of cool stuff and just play and play!
2,Rct 2 Wacky worlds,Its ok but not worth the money look Chris cannot say that hes got all the rides and coasters in the game so why not put the ones which are not in it for example the new top thrill dragster ride at cedar point ohio and use that track or a waltzers or something in it instead lame sceney that not that much people use much and theres different types of water coasters when will he do these rides.
1,Cannot install this product,Cannot put it on my computer unless i already have it on my hard drive did not know this I wouldn't had brought this if I've known. Do you have any suggestions please I really love this game.
1,Eek!,"Time Twister even beats this one for the RCT 2 Expansions. This is not-well designed. Also, the map of your park is so primative. Can't you take screenshots -- or better yet, the game does it for you -- and assemble a map instead of orange lines on a dotty surface?The game adds NO and I promises NONE new rides, just new ""themes"" for existing ones. For example, ""Neptune"" ride is really a new-vehicled Twist and you'll see it has the same ratings (for) Excitement, Nausea, Intensity.I think (but this applies to the whole RCT 2 line) that the game leaves much to be desired.Wacky Worlds simply is not there. Not close. We get scenarios like ""build around the Great Wall of China"". How stupid is that? Honestly? And then, we have an Eifel Tower scenery but no park to center it! It's just weird.Not really worth the buy."
1,RCT takes a step backwards,"I love a good rollercaster snaking through the trees, and in RCT2 it was a great enhancement from RCT1 that you could build a coaster and have the trees automatically removed as you add track. So why would that functionality be removed from the expansion, Wacky Worlds? I don't want to spend my time removing trees, I want to build coasters. If you enjoy frustration and wasting your time, skip Wacky Worlds and go right for Tree Removal Tycoon!"
2,Must be ADVANCED,"This expansion pack is good (for a ""roller coaster tycoon""}. I thought maybe it would give me extras in any theme park but no, I could only get Wacky Worlds theming and roller coasters in the new parks that Wacky Worlds added which had impossible goals. All ""roller coaster tycoons"" out there this expansion is perfect for you."
3,Worst RollerCoaster Tycoon to Date!,"This game is a huge let down! There are 17 new sceneros and a little over 50 new rides..... nothing worth mentioning. I recomend any RCT fan to wait till this ones price drops because this game requires the RCT2 disc to run it! That's right, the Wacky Worlds disc does not play the game. on the RCT2 disc the Wacky Worlds parks simply have a WW next to them. It really isn't worth it's price!"
1,Bad-Shameful Dun Waste $$,Okay honestly Chris should destroy the contract with infogrames and team up wit hasbro the old rct company!Don't Buy This Game Or You'll Be SRY!
3,"Ok, but not the best","I bought this expansion thinking that it would be great. I was somewhat wrong, but somethings I thouight were quite nice. The scenery is beautific in this game, but there are no ""new"" rides. They're just recreations of older rides with new cars. Some of the new cars were in my imagination, like the ""bullet"" coaster, or the ""TGV"". However, some of them I thought were pretty rediculous. The sloth, gorlilla, koala, etc... I say are pretty dumb. I mean, who wants any of those in a street racing park like mine? Not me. Also, I'd like one new coaster: A strata-launch coaster. I uninstalled it yeseterday, probably because some the new rides don't fit my street racing park. My advice: try at a friend's house first, and see if you like it."
1,Absolutely terrible,"The expansion is nothign but a collection of very very poor scenery items. Nearly all of the items are not to scale with the game and they do not fit with the artistic style. There are no new rides, contrary to what they say, there are only new cars for your existing rides. And while that may sound good, only a few are actually enjoyable. This expansion is the worst of the worst. Avoid it at all costs unless you hate having an extra ($)"
4,Uhh.. Uhh.. No,"Infogrames has gone over the line. All these expansion packs are driving me crazy. If one more comes around I will be crazy. And look, Wacky Worlds is finally coming out. Besides my opinion, the game is a must have if RC2 was already bought. I own the original Roller Coaster Tycoon, the Cockscrew Follies expansion pack, Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, and I might just be waiting for this new game. Already in my shelf includes games I don't play. Why would this be needed. Infogrames is just doing something wrong."
4,Droooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnne,"There are two versions of Vein, and they look identical but for the grooves carved into them, due to differing number of songs - Vein II (drone version) has one track per side (side A - 16:57, side B - 16:43), while Vein I (crust version) has twelve tracks, six on each side. None of the songs on either album have titles.The drone album sounds like a million other Boris drone projects - guitar buzzing away on top of some Merzbow-like noise on the first side, more of the same (but louder) on the second side. Actually, that's not true - nearly halfway through Side B, the full band starts playing, meaning that this is a rare drone where Atsuo plays drums as frantically as he plays them on the band's crustiest, rockiest releases."
4,buy this for the beautiful color photos!,"Though by no means a complete showing of every shape made for each design, it IS a very generous sampling of each design, with beautiful studio photographs cover to cover. That makes it a must-have for any Roseville lover- none of the ugly black and white catalogue page reprints. NOT so great for pricing information. The pieces are priced with their existing blemishes, which would make a perfect piece of the same design worth ?? how much ?? Also has price listed for the whole set, if the photo includes more than one piece. That is just not helpful when you want to put a value on one piece.If not for the vague pricing information, I would rate this 5 stars- especially compared to other Roseville guides. Very helpful visuals in this one!"
2,Warman's Roseville Pottery,"I am not happy with my recent purchase of Warman's Roseville book. It does not provide a complete listing of suggested prices and many of the pictured pieces are described with damage along with a price. For example, hanging basket with ""chip on handle."" For a serious collector the book is not of much use and for the inexperienced collector the book is misleading--damaged pieces do not sell for anything close to what mint pieces sell for."
1,Useless to collectors,"The book states it is a price guide. The author had pictures of as many as 9 pieces being auctioned and vague discriptions of some with chips. Another example is a Donatello jardiniere (with chip repair) & pedestal $180-$220. A picture of a Donatello bud vase on the same page just over 6"" is listed at $180-$220.Yet another jardinier on the same page (smaller than the one that includes the pedestal with a rim chip is $200-$250.Auction prices for multiple pieces & damaged items need to be kept separate."
4,Growing Younger-Psychology,This book was an easy read for those that are looking for a psychology life span book. I found that all the chapters were interesting. The price of the book isn't bad either.
4,Why not?,"This is the tape that completes the episodes for the Yes Minister series. I bought it after i had already bought the 'vol 1, Yes Minister' tape and possibly this is the reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. If you browse through my other review on the vol 1 Yes Minister tape you will find that it is a MUST HAVE for your Brit comedy collection. The vol 2 tape, however, contains 3 instead of 4 episodes. ( I felt a bit 'taken' in that). The plot is always worthy of 'full attention', however, a bit 'weaker' than the vol 1 episodes. I still enjoy having the tape (I have watched it as many times as vol 1). I would possibly NOT buy it ONLY if I wanted to move to the Yes, PRIME MINISTER series and had no money to spend (nevertheless, the amazon price is always low enough to consider purchase)."
1,Wow such a waste of time,"Drop was a massive let down. It is unfortunate to say, but this picture was lacking in so many aspects. I decided to give this movie a shot, mainly because being a huge Crow Zero fan I assumed this film would be similar in context and genre. Drop was not portrayed well at all. The characters did not have a special quality to them, like the ones from Crow Zero. To me, this film just simply felt like a cheap imitation of Crow Zero. Nothing really sparked my interest. It was a plain, dull movie, with no substance. Eww...Drop"
2,I Would Rather Pay More To Get A Better Picture,"I bought this webcam because it was on sale with a microphone. In the future I would rather pay full price for a webcam and a microphone, because both are basic and do not have any special features. This webcam produces a very dark picture, even after I have adjusted all of the settings. However, if you want a basic webcam it works well because you can at least see who you are talking to."
3,Ok,Its worth buying for 20 USD. The photo is dark even in day time. You will need a extra light to see the clear photo.
4,Labtec Webcam,"Good buy for the money. Picture is great, I'm having trouble with the sound coming through."
4,Well..,I had read a few good and bad reviews on this cam. And I have to say I agree with both. I can take pictures and record myself but I need to turn every light in my room on. But The pictures turn out pretty good. Even though nobody else can view I don't mind its like my own private show. they can hear me not that that will help. It was definitly worth the money.
1,"Great, when brand new, went fuzzy after a month!","I got this cam for $22 about 2.5 years ago. It was great for its price. Most cams were $40 or $50 boasting only 15 fps. At first this cam had great detail, but after a month the picture changed. Now it is unbelievably fuzzy and is probably around 1 fps. The picture is grainy, blurry, and just terrible! Do not buy this camera, because it could break like mine did. Next time I buy a cam, I will pay the extra $20 in hopes of some longevity."
4,Great Service,"The service was great, it was delivered very quickly and was in excellent condition! Now all I have to do is figure out how to download it correctly so that it will work!"
3,if you need it...,"I looked for a webcam with a low price and I got this one. Let me tell you, for what I paid, the quality is 50/50. If the clarity were better, this would've taken the greatest webcam pics. In other words, I could've held out to buy one with a clearer visual, but at the price I paid, it was worth its price."
1,"Never again,",I purchased this webcam based on the previous reviews. I am a computer saavy engineer and anticipated no problems. Was I ever wrong. Despite repeated attempts I could not get this webcam to work and I'm running a upgraded Dell. I've never had a problem with the Logitech cameras I installed on my kids computers.
3,It's opened. But it' new I think.,"I try it in my room, which is pretty dark. It doesn't has good picture as my old one has. But it has a more clear picture if there is more light."
3,Labtec needs to improve on lighting conditions,I bought a Labtec webcam pro for $23 and mind you the price is good for this deal. The webcam is actually fantastic and gives out sharp and clear picture. The only disadvantage that i could find was that it was very dim when the lighting was not appropriate. If i get the sunlight (or durting the day time) it works better than expensive ones but with the natural light going out this phases out too. The webcam needs to be improved drastically in this area.
3,Need extra lighting,"Easy to set up but it needs extra lighting. Room light alone is not enough. You need a desk light shines directly to your face to get decent images.Another inconvenience is that when the unit is placed on the desk top, you cannot tilt the camera up enough to see your face. It needs to be placed on top of something. I usually use a up-side-down mug."
2,Decent,I was hoping for a better quality web cam. Its EXTREMELY grainy and as fast as my connection is and my computer is the slightest movement creats a blur. On the up side its a great beginner cam and decent enough for the price...I wasn't expecting MEGAPIXELS or anything but I was hoping I didnt need to turn on 4 lights in the room to make me visable.
5,Got ya eyes on,"Good for the money, considering i bought this with my first computer 11 years ago, lol, i logged on to give a review for two toys i ordered for my girls last week, and discovered they had all my orders from years ago, its amazing also funny as hell."
5,couldn't expect more for the money,"I was expecting a lot less when I got this, but it's a great product. Super easy to use, the picture's not perfect but it's damn good considering it's $30. My place is low lit and I don't have a problem with the picture- sometimes if I turn the lights in my room up and down, it doesn't adjust entirely, but if I replug it in it's fine- and the program only takes 2 seconds to load straight to camera view. Great investment"
2,Rough around the edges...,"Yeah, this camera is good if you don't want awesome webcam quality across the net. And the picture sucks with Yahoo! but it looks pretty decent over MSN Messenger on a DSL connection. However, I have to put a lamp up near my monitor to be able to see myself because the light on this thing is terrible. Otherwise, its not too bad for the price. Myself, I'm taking this back to target ASAP and buying something of better quality."
5,great product; doesn't cost grip,This webcam has great quality pictures and video for under thirty bucks. That's cool with me. The only thing is the lighting has to be correct. It has to be from behind the cam. Overall great product and this is my first time having a webcam. Go ahead and cop....
1,"Decent picture, terrible microphone","My boyfriend bought me this webcam so we could talk over Skype easier as my previous setup wasn't the greatest. He has the same camera and loves it but when I used it the picture was fine but the microphone would only work for about 2 seconds before a very loud, high pitched, screeching came out through his speakers as well as mine. I tried uninstalling and installing the software over and over again without this problem going away. After attempting to call the tech support line only to find the phone number wasn't working, I tried e-mails. After sending two emails and waiting almost 6 days they still weren't very helpful.The camera is poor quality and their customer service is even worse. My boyfriend and I aren't buying anything from Labtec again."
3,decent cam,"The cam is good for the price. It works well with AOL and Pal Talk, the mic in cam did cause problems with playing music on paltalk and you need to change recording device in control panel but other then that it seems to work well."
2,Microphone problems !!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this webcam and at first I was very excited. It turned out I need to place additional lighting for the camera to not show a dark screen. On top of that after 20 sec of shooting a video the microphone produces a very annoying noise that takes over all other sounds. You cannot realize that when the video is recording, only when you play the recorded video. I exchanged the webcam thinking that it may be just a defective one. It turned out the second camera was defective as well. It had the exact same problem, which convinced me that may be it is a defect that most Labtec WebCam Pro had. You can certainly disable the mic and use a different one, but then why would you buy a webcam with a mic.In general it is not a bad webcam, if you are looking for an average one and lighting is not a problem for you. And keep in mind that there is a good possibility for the mic to be defective."
1,mic problems,Our family bought some of these for christmas. The camera works well enough but the mic was so fuzzy on all of our cameras that we never web cam with audio anymore. Its fine if you get an external mic.
4,Labtec Webcam - adequate,"I purchased this camera to use with Skype -and it does what it needs to do - thevideo is adequate, and it functions finewith Skype - not very attractive,and very plastic - you get what you pay for."
4,Good quality-Very satisfied,Having the sound built into the web cam makes a big difference in the quality. Picture is clear and the audio picks up from other rooms.Very good quality for the price!
3,working girl,"A karaoke whore in a big city hosts her father who's in town looking for his son/her brother while the mom is home with cancer. Not sure why she had to leave her village, but it was her pimp who killed her brother and his now her fetus's daddy."
5,love this book!,"this book got me thru some very hard months of ""trying"" to breastfeed. very positive outlook on breastfeeding without the guilt. perfect for someone struggling with breastfeeding. it will help get your confidence up and your guilt trip down!"

3,an impssobly dull judy,"most of the solos on this alblum were increadably dull such as ""Moon River"" and ""Shenandoah"". The only worthwhile parts of the cd was Judy and Liza's Duet ""Bob White"", and of course ""Here's to us"". I was moved by ""Battle Hymn of the republic"" and ""There's no business like show business"". ""Liza"" was a nice song, too. It didnt include a lot of Judy's showtunes that we long for. I was VERY dissapointed by ""Get Happy/ Happy days are here again"" because I dont have Get Happy on cd and wass expecting this to be a double hitter but turned out to be very dull and boring. Overall, you should buy this alblum but I would recommend not getting your hopes up."
4,Some fine moments from a legendary series,"From the never-before- released, never aired first song of the first show (""Sunny Side Up"") to the never-before-released, never aired finale of the final show (""Here's To Us""), this CD fascinates. The failed intros and uncompleted performance of ""Something Cool"" -also from the final taping- is ... well, fascinating. The change in her voice from the earliest cuts (notably ""Liza"") to the end is also telling, the difference in miking notwithstanding. The liner notes mention ""Here's Top Us"" as the "" holy grail"" of Garland fans, and boy, is he right! Certainly the most heartbreaking -and yet triumphant- performance I have ever heard from Judy. It was, after all these years of only hearing ABOUT that song, actually quite difficult for me to get through it, it is so charged with emotion. It is somrthing to behold, this collection, done with respect, love and technical skill. Enjoy."
4,Huh?,"This is a truly bizarre release. Wonderful moments but a most ecentric choice of songs. Worth having for ""Here's to Us"", ""Battle Hymn"" (again) and some of the duets. So, a mixed blessing but we should be grateful people continue to work so hard to bring us as complete a record of the greatest entertainer of our time."
5,poetic music,And it literally is! Stare Dobre puts poems by a few different polish poets to music. I would call it folk as it has an accoustic guitar sound.My favorite polish band and one of my favorite overall. Czarny Blues O Czwartej Nad Ranem is one of the best ballads I have ever heard. I recommend this song heartily. Please give it a shot....
3,A Nice Reinterpretation,"Well, as with most tributes, there is a fine line between homage and horrid... this compilation seems to do a good job of not ruining what I consider to be ""perfect"" songs. They do, however, reinterpret the songs somewhat drastically - these are not strict cover tunes! Very electronic - very dancey... I am an avid fan of world music, rock music, and electronic music so this is my cup of tea, so to speak. It may or may not be yours :)"
1,What's with all of the farting techno beats?,"I am a fan of (and own) Peter Gabriel's entire catalog, enjoy tribute records made to other artists and even like some you-tube posted renditions of Peter Gabriel's songs.I listened to this entire disc, and tried to give it a chance. However, I have to say that this record stinks. Wow. I did not know if you can butcher that many songs on one disc and have it be commercially viable. Even for techno freaks and world music flavor of the month types, I don't know who can stand listening to this album more than once.In a phrase, they collectively tried to hard, and failed to improve, or even have interesting takes on old PG stand-bys. I'd pass on this one."
3,I guess truth really is relative,"I would have given this book a good review. The stories were interesting and raw...just like I like them. That is until I got to the part where ""Lusty Lloyd"" writes a story about someone I love. It was unkind, ignorant, and just plain false. Had the names of these people been used, he could have been very easily sued for slander. I grew up in Ash Valley...I know these people. The title states that these are ""His True Life Stories."" 207 true stories? I think not. In fact, a great deal of these stories are embellishments. I bought this book as a Christmas present, but could not give it to anyone because it would have hurt them. Had it been true, I'd let it go. But I know it's not. I was very disappointed. But if you don't care about that, then you'll probably love this book."
4,Great Game for the Star Trek Fan,"This Game is one the Best Star Trek games i've played so far. I would recommend this to anyone who has a 700 Mhz or more computer. The Bad part about this one is that you can get tired of it after playing it for a couple of months. Anyone who dosen't have much gaming experience, get this Game!!"
3,"Well, it's getting better, but......","This is my second review of this game. I've managed to progress further into it, but still don't think it's a great Trek game. So far, I've made it to the fourth CD with six in all, but it's just too boring and difficult at times. I think they should come out with the Romulan Academy, or maybe even the Borg Academy. I'll keep up with it though. I've made it this far."
3,never was finished,i remember this game being highly anticipated back in 2000 to be the greatest star trek combat sim.. it was sort of... they promised all sorts of stuff in the game.. addons etc.. Then they disbanded 14 degs leaving everyone that bought the game for 50 bucks with a broken half made game game going wtf.. and interplay then went bankrupt a year or later. they released 2 minor patches to fix bugs but that was it.. the game had real potential. i still play it on occasion it brings back great memories.
1,Warning: They're In Spanglish!!,"I know that the author is trying to be ""authentic"", but this is really, really hard to read. It would be fine if it was in English, in Spanish, or even in some mixture of the two. But it is not. It is in some freakish new thing that I am referring to as Spanglish. Incorporated amongst words that my limited knowledge tells me are Spanish. Then, there are words that are English, although there aren't very many. But the real problem is the words that don't exist in any language, like ""gointu"". This is awful and I can only barely - by reading it aloud - understand what the people are saying. Furthermore, the stories are not very good. The characters have little depth in the one play that I read (which was roughly 60% of the book), except for one, and they all seem stereotypes. This, along with the language, makes it seem as if it were written by some racist, rather than a Chicano/a.All told, there is no way I could conscientiously recommend this to anyone.Harkius"
5,Excellently done,"The episode features his companions more than the doctor himself, however it truly is a classic. The plot developement and charcater developement are astounding. This is a must have!"
4,Good used VHS condition is hard to find.,"This product shipping quickly, arriving at my home within 5 days. The VHS was in very good condition, seemed only slightly used. I would recommend/plan on shopping with this seller again."
5,Whatcha album lack is more Jay-Z,Much better than all of those bullS@#t movies Master P put out. JAYHOVAH END OF THE SESSION F@#* WIT ME NOW(jay-z on clue:da professional) up&coming artist Ro from VA.
4,Generalized review,Friedman et al have done a commendable job of explaining the entire clinical trial process. The monograph is complete as to the requirements of the undertaking and adequate resource is devoted to serveral of the more problematic areas such as sample size estimation and the establishment of baseline characteristics.
4,CONCISE MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH,"The fact that this book was designed for researchers, who are involved in experimental (clinical) trials, makes the basic knowledge of statistics essential.Using an interactive multidisciplinary approach to investigation, this handbook embraced all aspects clinical and paraclinical survey. It is very easy-to-follow, and divulges its methodology in concise manner. ""Fundamentals of Clinical Trials"" is one book that will help alleviate the rigorous chores of epidemiologists. However, an advanced or versatile researcher may complain that some of the information in it are too summarized."
4,Detailed introduction,"Comprehensive book. Requires good understanding of basic statistics and mathematics for some chapters. However without this, it is still a great book for a solid foundation on Clinical Trial design and conduct."
2,Too much narration and boring,This book is not well written for the busy post grad who would like to glance the basic points. It has neither illustrations nor bullet points. It is absolutely boring to read through.
5,Wonderful,We were tired of purchasing the small bags of pork rinds at the grocery store then I found these! These are absolutely the best. In fact it's time to make another order!
2,My Own Device,"While the effort is there, this CD isn't anything we haven't heard before from a 1,000 other singer/songwriters. This CD drifts into too many directions for me. Condron should back off from trying to convince the listener that he is a great vocalist, to using just enough emotions in his vocals to sell his stories he sings about. A good producer could help maybe find that nich. I would be willing to hear more, but only if this artist seeks a direct focal point for his music When Condron can find a true path direction he may go places."
2,Not deep enough,"Good information, but really just scratches the surface of most topics. Not enough in-depth material for anything more than a basic understanding."
5,"15 years, and still the best.",I've had and used this video for 15 years. It's the only reason I still have my VCR. I hope someday there will be a DVD of this workout.. I also reccomend: Introduction to light Weight Traning.
5,Introduction to Low-Impact Aerobics,This VHS tape was in very good condition. It played well and I have no complaints.
3,Real Beginner Video,As I am trying to get back into exercising I want to keep my exercises low impact. This video is definitely that. I found it a bit too easy for my taste.
5,GREAT MATERIAL!,"""The Tom Baker Years"" is a fine collection of scenes and other material from Tom Baker's seven years as the Doctor. No ""Doctor Who"" fan would want to miss this one! Grade: A+"
1,Tizoc,"I don't actually have a review of the movie yet, but I do have a complaint about the lack of description details in language format. I need to view this movie for a school project so I ordered it, but it came in Spanish with no subtitles so i sent it back and am getting the run around on purchasing the correct one. Why isn't the language disclosed in the description so people like me who do NOT speak Spanish will know NOT TO BUY!!!!!"
1,Robbed by shipping and handling!!!,$27.62 shipping and handling for 30.00 product (24 cans of chili). I never requested priority shipping. Profit profit profit!!!! 8^<
4,"Intriguing, for young AND old!","I've so far read most of Yamanaka's work and liked it all! The subject material is hard and sometimes painfully honest but well worth the read. At 26, I think this book can be appreciated by all ages, and really isnt a ""young adult"" book. It is much like her other novels, only a little less harsh in the subject matter. (In her other books the author often depicts some explicit and painful to read scenes involving the characters or animals that may not be the best images for children)Yamanaka has a knack for describing the peoples of Hawaii with a unique feel in all her books. This book, like Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers etc., can be appreciated by audiences of any age who want to have a good, cant-put-it-down type of experience. I recommend it for anyone who likes this interest group!"
3,Mixed Review,"I think that this book was good and bad. It had some innappropriate events, but all in all it was a good book. This book portrays friendship a bit differently than normal ones, but it was a novel that was obviously meant for enjoyment and pleasure rather than truth."
1,"8000 W Surge, Only 6600 W Continuous - Misleading","After all of the hundreds of generators that I've looked at online and in person, this is the only one the gives the Surge Power as THE power of the unit. Usually, generators list the continuous or running watts as the selling point of the generator, which in this case should be 6600 Watts. The details will list the surge power of the unit...not the other way around. This is misleading and in this case, in my opinion is a deliberate attempt to grab the attention and money of the consumer who is TOO eager to investigate the details of the unit before purchasing. I have no experience with the performance of the unit, but I have plenty of experience with selling and marketing practices and this is not good."
2,Ehh. It was ok.,"The clip was great at first but about a couple weeks later, I was taking it out to text a friend of mine the top of the clip snapped. I was rather pissed to say the least."
2,Good Premise but Not Impressed,"Although the basic idea of this documentary was great, it never lived up to its possibilities. To it's credit, it sported some good clips, valid statistics and a great role model for proactive city counsels. Unfortunately it was also choppy, individual threads of action and progression difficult to follow. There were no clear outlines for other communities looking to follow this example and the storylines developed slowly and out of joint with one another. All things considered, there are vastly better documentaries available regardless of which aspect of this story appeals to you."
4,Thrills and Chills,"The great thing about this video is that it contains the most thrilling parts of many memorable games, including clutch home runs by Joe Carter and Kirk Gibson. Great game-saving defensive plays are also featured, as well as game-losing defensive blunders (and that means you, Mr. Buckner). The narration is flat but sparse. My only complaint is that there are some obvious omissions like the Mets-Astros 1986 marathon playoff game or Luis Sojo's inside-the-park grand slam in the 1995 Mariners-Angels one-game playoff, just to name a couple examples. But this is still one of the best baseball highlight videos out there."
3,Strong but not certain,"3 1/2Solid debut from the talented trumpeter runs from softer ballads to progressive meddlings, often triumphing with technique. More often then not these compositions however, like many great contemporary works, feel more intellectually derivative then passionately original, as a few of the strongest tracks on the recording otherwise hint towards."
4,Very nice product,"I like the bright light. Installation was smooth. I just wish it came with a relay, but other than that, I like it."
1,Does NOT weigh 4 pounds.... doesn't even weigh 2 pounds,"At the time of this writing, the Item Weight for this product is 4 pounds. Sounds like a great deal, eh? Of course the Shipping Weight is only 2 pounds, but, hey, that's still a lot of cat nip, right?Here's the deal: you get one package which contains just over 0.3 ounces (9 grams) of catnip. When you buy from non-Amazon vendors -- even if the order is fulfilled by Amazon, you never know what you'll end up with."
1,There is not a place for -* reviews.,"I rarely return items to Amazon because I typically do my homework before making a purchase. I read reviews here, elsewhere and price check. With that being said I returned these as soon as they arrived. Flimsy, thin material and either the dye job was horrendous, or the one shirt my husband opened had grease stains. Seriously???? No matter, they went back. Back to drawing board for an affordable pocket polo for Hubs to wear to work."
5,nice shirt,hello i want you to know the shirt was a great deal . i got it for a family member for christmas. when i received it you could not exspect anything better then this so thank you for everything i have got from you so far
1,very poor quality,"I got a very poor cheap quality shirt. Total ripoff. The color was off and I think it looks like a woman's shirt. Very slow shipping. Save yourself the headache and avoid these people, buy from someone else."
4,good value,good value for the price well constructed and size is as advertised shipment arrived within the the time interval that was promised
4,"Well, I like it...","I used this for the first time last night when baking cookies for a charity and was very pleased. I have very limited space in my kitchen and it was wonderful to be able to stack up the cookies on something that doesn't take up a lot of counter space and doesn't require crowding the cookies together to fit them, and with the large clearance underneath and between each shelf the cookies cooled very quickly.The fact that it is not close-knit grid, as mentioned in the other review, is an error made by the company selling this (Robinson), not the product itself, which works fine and nowhere on the box does it have that description. However, if you are baking delicate cookies that can droop and harden in unwanted shapes then having a grid type rack would be preferable over this model."
1,Product not as described,"The description says ""Close-knit grid pattern"" but the rack is not a grid - just parallel bars - the only cross pieces are a few for support of the rack."
2,"Good concept, but...","My wife and I bought this book because the subject is certainly a timely one. We had high hopes for it, but to tell the truth we were disappointed. We found that the story was good but the characters were too flat. The main character (Cameron) does everything well and is a hero to all; his father is the ultimate villan with (as far as we could tell) no redeeming qualities. The conflict between evolution and creationism (and we belong 100% in the first camp) is painful and complex and we thought it was not written in that complexity."
2,"Great topic, lousy execution.","I had high hopes for this book, given that it deals with a subject near and dear to my heart. The problem of the creationist agenda in public schools is very real, and needs to be written about. But Mr. Neill's coverage of it in this novel was just too superficial for me. There wasn't enough ""oomph"" to the story.Besides that, this book contains, hand-down, the absolute WORST dialogue of any book I've ever read. Derrick, dude... you really need to take a class in how to write dialogue. It's terrible!"
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"I had expected a more in-depth treatment of the subject of this book, and in that respect was disappointed. But overall, it is a particularly timely book because it deals with the conflict and controversy of so-called Creation Science. Entertaining, and an easy read. It would be particularly suited to the young adult who is questioning the existence of god and spiritual issues except that there is some ""R-rated"" scenes in the book that some parents might find objectionable."
1,no worth the time... even if it was free!,"i was in complete disbelief at the talentless writing style this book vomited at me. blah. every major american belief system has some poorly portrayed sterotype that makes one cringe... the naive mindset of this writer is difficult to bear! it seems to be written to a (very) young child's level, but even there the tone seems condescending. this book could be used in writing classes as an example of what NOT to write like. sad, too... such an important message as free speech deserves better speakers. don't get me wrong though -- i have nothing against the author himself or the message he is defending... in fact, i'm completely behind him! i was just in disbelief that any publisher would print this garbage! please don't waste your time on this one -- i was so upset with this book that i threw it across the room when i was finished. <sigh> that's three hours of my life i'll never see again. heh."
2,"Required, of moderate quality","This book was required for a course I took. It was of moderate quality. Not the best textbook, not the worst."
5,How I See It,"Well, I got this book about the second week into the time alocated for delivery. I am okay with the product's conditon. It was new as descrided and unused as was said. Would account on amazon for any other products that I may need in the near future."
5,LIFE CHANGING!!!,"You NEED this CD set.... it will change your life!! Because of the trainings on this CD set I am 100% debt free, after having over 6-figures in debt!!!"
2,Learn Italian,It wasn't until I took a class that I learned how really bad this translation is. There is a new English translation that is quite expensive but a lot more accurate. The original translators of this book moved Gramsci's text all over the place an re-ordered and recombined sections to say something different or often speak against what Gramsci originally meant.
4,make sure you order the right one,"The product arrived on time; it's arrival was ahead of time allowed for delivery. But i ordered the wrong item, so it does not work."
1,DO NOT BUY!,The internal spring is too weak. The gun only shoots upside down. This I found out now is a typical problem. Cheap made stuff. DO NOT BUY!
1,Stuiped,The shipping took eight days and from where it shipped from it should have tooken four. When it finally did get here it did not work it fired two stalled for a few shots fired one and stalled again. I orderd this because my original one broke.
3,M83 mag,i hate this mag it holds less than 50 bbs and that means it runs out fast. i have read alot of other reviews and they say to buy other mags so i would take their advice. the gun doesn't have any bigger mags that i could find so if you are in a fight with other people most likely the others are going to dominate. it is good for semi auto but full auto will eat the bullets up.
1,Buyer beware !,"I've no clue as to what an ""M83"" is, but I know very well what an M4 is. What is depicted on the AMAZON item page is a standard M4 airsoft magazine. What was sent was some weird unit with a REVERSE CURVATURE. In brief, USELESS! The seller refuses to make good on this item without pictures being taken. Not going to happen. Buyer beware!"
2,I dont suggest using this....,"I am quite an avid airsofter and have seen guns come and go. From spring to Electric. When I first started, I used my quiet and quaint little 'standard' clip because the Hi-cap (high capacity mag) that came with my gun was broken. After having to reload 10+ times during a firefight, I decided to get another hi-cap and have not looked back since. I do keep my standard and recently fixed old high-cap on me as back up, but you really don't need it with the 400+ rnds a hi-cap holds. Avoid buying extra standard clips unless you plan on carrying 10 or more in combat or not having to throw some suppressive heat down. In my circle of players we have a bit of an understood hierarchy, from highest to lowest: Hi-cap Autos, Standard autos, auto-pistols, spring rifles, spring pistols. save yourself the worry in combat, see if you can't find a hi-cap. (and in my opinion, avoid double eagle guns as they use clips that dont fit in any other gun and they break really easy.)"
4,Good item to get.,"It works well, but occasionally overloads and makes the case crack open. Still, it works."
5,Great customer service!,I got the wrong magazines for my gun and they sent me the correct ones. Although I did not use these magazines they seemed sturdy. My review is more about the company its self and there excellent customer service. I notified them that the mags did not fit and they sent me the correct ones!
2,mag for m4 and m16 m83 only,"This is not janice it is her son and im into airsoft. I have an m4 electric airsoft gun and a mag, it held 40 rounds so i figured that it would fit in my airsoft gun. Today it arrived and it looked exactly the same except for the fact that a little part where it connected to the chamber of the gun and it wouldn't click in to place. I was pretty disappointed. I wish that it would explain clearer what guns it fits on. Blame it on me or on the product description, it wasn't what I wanted. I really don't know what mag will fit I have not found one after a lot of searching. So if you know that it will fit your gun, it is decently sturdy, only holds 40 and would probably work the way it should, go for it. But before buying please verify that it will fit your gun. Some more close-up views of top of the gun would have saved me some money."
1,jammed,The gun jammed on the first fire. Several pellets. I could not get them out by recommended means. I had to take it apart and it still lies apart on my study floor....Jack
3,"Works fine, just be careful..","If you have this gun, it's definitely worth getting more magazines for it and these work fine... As long as you load it slowly.When you use the loader that comes with the gun, its about a full rod and when it's full, you aren't able to load any more in.HOWEVER, I was using a speed loader, the ones you push down with your thumb repeatedly, and it didn't stop when it was full and the magazine was spreading apart in half, luckily my friend noticed and I released all the BBs and it's been fine ever since. Although there is one BB lost inside of it so that it rattles, which is pretty annoying.Summed up, if you have this gun and enjoy using it, I recommend buying more mags, just be careful loading it."
3,its ok,umm mine came and it was feeding well but now i have to push up on it for it to fire if i dont then it will shoot nothing but air it might just be mine but idk.
3,not the best mag,This mag isnt the best i was out side shooting and i dropped it and it split in half so know i half to super glue and tape it together
3,????,Im wondering can i use it in a Boyi AEG Airsoft Electric M16 Rifle M4A1 R.I.S. Version????Thanks!!!!!
5,Great!,Worth the money. Definetly buy an extra mag cause it goes through BB's real quick. Overall a great product. I'm having a lot of fun with it. :)
5,"If you buy the gun, get some.","I have a total of 5 of these mags right now. You'll need 'em. If you're using full auto, you'll have an empty mag before you know it. These mags are heavy (in a good way) and VERY sturdy. Heck, use 'em as a melee weapon if you have to. One last thing, just don't try loading these things by hand. Get a speed loader..."
4,backup,good for backup if incase your other mag brakes you got another one like what happened to me but any way should always keep an extra pair of these TIP tape the 2 in opposite ways so when you run out of ammo just turn it around and u got a fresh clip.
2,deffective,"When I got my m83 it worked for a while until the clip went out skipped a few rounds and eventually didn't work at all until I held the gun upside down so the clip could feed. I bought another which is this one and It now has the same problem. I did some surgery and figured out that the little square on the upper right side was how the clip was held in the gun. So I melted another hole slightly below the square and taped up the square. Now the clip can be jammed up inside the gun a little more so I dont have to hold the gun upside down. The problem was probably that the original square in the clip was too high so the gun couldn't get the bbs fed into it right. Well, now the clip works but still skips a few rounds but I'm just happy that it works. If you want a new clip I would highly recommend a metal or something with five stars. Whatever you do, do not buy this!"
3,Iffy,"I got 2mags and they arived LATE! Not only were they late, but one of them had a cracked top. What's the deal with that. Anyway, it's the only mag for the M83 so...... yeah. Good luck."
1,the worst Rodney Yee video,Lots of nattering. Very little yoga. It is in 8-minute chunks and at first it is hard to understand how to view the whole thing at once. This is the worst Rodney Yee video.
1,Do not waste your money,"Evidently Rodney is more about making $$$ than creating yoga. I am furious I wasted nmoney on this DVD. There is no ""yoga"". Only talking and micro movements. My 82 year old mother would be bored with this DVD. Shame on you Rodney for selling out!!!"
1,Not a good dvd,This is not worth the money. Does little to improve your Yoga practice. I wish I had my money back. I assumed tht this DVD would help with core strength and balance. It doesn't not at all. I wish I had my money back to spend on something that was worth it
2,informative,"informative, but repetitious. not a yoga workout but more talking. no sweat here! totally not worth it. so far his power yoga is my favorite."
4,Find your balance,"Before you buy the dvd make sure this is what you want. The entire dvd is about finding balance between opposing forces. It is not a strong work out, but it is effective at finding your balance."
3,DVD is very different from his older style.,"Rodney Yee's Core Centered Yoga DVD still has beautiful scenery behind his poses. However, this DVD is much more ""chatty"" than I remember the other DVDs being. He talks about body-part ""dialogues"" and ""conversations"", etc. It's not what you would call a physical workout. It's 46 minutes and is mostly about ""balance"" and locating your ""core center"". There are 6 more minutes of downloadable ""life balance meditation"". Why not just put it in the DVD? I have seen the DVD twice and am still working out what it's for. It's not bad, I just don't quite get it yet."
5,I love this tea!,I drink this tea all the time. We brew up a couple pitcher fulls of iced tea per day. It tastes like the tea at PF Changs and Cheesecake Factory. It's wonderful to be able to enjoy it at home.
4,Pretty Tasty,"I wanted to buy this for my mom and myself, because Panda Express has a tea with the same name at their restaurants. Although, when I made it myself, it didn't taste the same. This could be because they use a different tea, or a different strength, or because they have a very expensive, powerful brewer to make it with, but it's still pretty tasty. I really enjoy putting about half a can of frozen lemonade inside my pitcher and let the tea brew onto that to make some nice Passion Tea Lemonade."
5,Helps to heal,"I used these CDs for healing after a surgery and they were very useful to me. I didn't know if they would actually work, but I felt that they did. They made me more aware of what was going on in my body (and soul) and so made me more aware of how I could heal. I recommend them."
2,Exagerated Expectations,"Sure, a positive outlook is beneficial to help support good health. But lets not get carried away with hype. Andrew Weil is famous for his brand of hype. I was at first taken in by his personality, seemingly rational arguments, and great presentations. In time, as I found reality still in existence, Weil's hypnotic influence was just not sustainable.Save your money. Do not believe in modern day saviors. They all offer artificial techniques for dealing with the natural realities of life. It's like using fertalizers and toxic chemicals to manage your garden. Ultimately, this is harmful to the ecology, unhealthful, and is never sustainable. False teachings of any kind, are like this concept of gardening.Instead, believe in a higher power, and believe in yourself. Keep later day Messiahs' hands out of your pockets."
2,Not very impressive and redundant....,"I didn't think this CD set was a good value. There are a lot of other products in this genre and I don't think this particular one is up to snuff.The lecture part is decent and for people who aren't familiar with guided imagery, it's a nice introduction. Unfortunately, it also consumes a lot of the total time.The guided imagery exercises are almost identical. When I heard this the first time, I couldn't quite believe it. I would like to see someone of Dr. Weil's credibility put out something better or else not collaborate with the individual.I guess the purchasing decision around this CD should focus on your level of experience with guided visualization. If you don't know much about it and have never been exposed to other similar products, then you might find it very useful. If you have done other things in this area, you will most likely be disappointed."
4,Great second digital camera!,"We were previous owners of a Kodak and were looking for a step up from the basic digital point and shoot. We are very happy with this Fuji model. The 10x zoom is awesome. We took it on a beach vacation and got great action shots from far away. The camera is smaller than you think. It fits in a palm and is pretty light. Granted, it won't fit in a pocket, but that is trade between size/convenience and higher photo quality. The flash is much better than our Kodak; it is much more powerful and does a better job filling in the light indoors. Indoor pictures of our kids are much clearer and have truer color. The flash does drain the batteries quicker, but when used outdoors, we can easily get several hundred photos on a single set of AAs. I don't care much for the included Fuji software; I have chosen to use a third party one instead."
2,Noisy pictures,"I really don't understand all the good reviews for this camera listed here. Pictures come out terrible, unless all you print are 4x6's. If you view your picture at full size on your computer, the noise is so bad, many important details are obscured. 6MP mode is of no you either. I think the pictures come out even worse than in 3MP mode. Everyone seems to to love the 10x zoom. But its this 10x zoom lens thats causing many of the image quality problems. Because the camera amplifies the noise (a lot) as you inrcease the zoom (larger min f-number), i don't like to use it very much. Pictures are only acceptable in bright outdoor light, with min f-stop. Oh well, if you've never owned an Olympus, Sony, Canon, or Nikon, you may not realize what your missing. I traded my Canon G5 for this because of the 10x zoom. BIG mistake! I miss sharp, clear, and colorful digital pics now :("
4,Great step towards a SLR digital camera,"Just bought my Fuji S5000 a month ago and am extremely pleased with it!Out of the box I was taking impressive, detailed pictures!Although daytime shots are taken best with this camera, with some setting adjustments nighttime shots can be pretty good.I have taken most of my shots on the 3 mp setting and they have turned out great.Although in order to use the Raw format you have to use the 6 mp setting.The zoom is great. I used it taking pictures from a moving vehicle and you couldnt even see a blur.I found by reading the book and experimenting most of the problems people have can be overcome.Only cons with this camera is you tend to get a lot of blur on low light shots. And lastly the included software isnt the greatest"
5,You must get this camera!,"I am so thrilled with this camera! The pictures are amazing - the detail and clarity is astounding, and the color is beautiful. You can take color pictures or black and white, adjust the megapixels and ISO - all very easily. The zoom is extremely strong. I highly recommend this camera to anyone who is thinking of getting a digital. I can't imagine owning anything else."
5,Great Digital Camera!!!,You can't get better than this camera for the price! The picture quality combined with the 22x (overall) zoom and changeable lens makes this THE digital camera to buy.
4,Good camera have used it for 3 years,"This is a very good camera, unfortunately Fuji has stopped production of this model... it is very good for starters to learn about photography and slowly move towards a DSLR mode i guess...i have used this camera for last three years and now i have a broken battery lid.. which is due to th eplastic body.. i feel this is the only drawback this camera has other wise this is really a good handy camera...."
3,Great pictures if you use the flash,"After using the point and shoot camera for a decade, I wanted to try a digital SLR. Once I saw the prices, this was my compromise. For the first year or so, we were really happy with it. The only complaint we have it that it will not take a focused picture with the flash off.5 years latter: four brand new batteries last literally 10 minutes. About half that time if we use rechargeable batteries. I only use the camera if I have about 8 to 16 rechargeable batteries ready to go for a short birthday party. Otherwise, a camera phone today takes pictures of similar quality (without the zoom)."
4,Great Clock,"I bought this clock to be the center piece on the mantle in the great room. This clock is very well made, good quality weight and the iron work is very attractive. The finish is slightly darker then the photo, but not much. You will not be disatisfied."
2,Ridiculous Prices for a movie that is Avalaible.........,Beware.............The puppet master series 1-3 can be bought for $19.99 at fullmoondirect.com.The covers are in spanish because they are Imports but they play in English. Cover is the same so do not pay these ridiculous prices that these creeps are selling this movie for. I bought the Import of Puppet Master 2 and was hIghly satsfied and it is from full moon just an Import. The Movie definately gets 5 stars....................
4,Almost the same thing,"If you are interested in buying the import version of Sheryl Crows Greatest hits, it's not a bad idea. In Same ways it is suprior but it lacks a couple major cutts. One being the Country Remix of ""The First Cutt is the Deepest"" featured on the original. But does incldude ""Run Baby Run.."" Which I don't believe is on the in state version. However, the stand out track that makes this worth buying is the Remix of ""C'mon C'mon"" Which features the Corrs. The Corrs had a big hit in the states a couple years back with ""Breathless."" This version never released in the United States for whatever reason so is definatly worth the money. This CD has 16 tracks and with the exception of two songs that are on the World Version and not the States version it's the same thing. However in the same token there are two tracks on the State's version that is not on the World one, so basically you take your pick!"
5,A perfect spy series,"This is a really memorable and extraordinarily well done story of the life of a spy. Unlike most other spy films, it tries to explain why and how, starting from his childhood, an individual becomes a spy and a double-agent. The series is so well crafted that I believed every instant of the story, and remained in total awe until the very end. I rate this even better than the also extremely good Le Carré series with Alec Guiness."
2,A disappointment,"I chose this series because I wanted to see how the Le Carre novels were filmed -- starting with Tinker, Tailor (a masterpiece of acting and direction). But Perfect Spy doesn't work well. Ray McNally is excellent and more nuanced than one might expect. But the two actors at the center of the story -- Peter Egan and Rudiger Weigang, both solid actors -- don't work at all. They're awkward at best.It's not their fault. The direction seems pretty poor. The framing of the shots is often lazy. The story edges along gracelessly. To carry off a character study of this kind, a director needs to be very creative and able to work closely with the actors. No sense of that here.Too bad! It's a great story that deserves a great film or -- as in this case -- series."
1,Betty Bobble head,"I never got this item. I would have liked it! I hope I didn't pay for it! Now, I will have to look...."
5,Great Book for ANY Girl interested in Ballet,This book is great for swowing that it is what you are interested in and not what every body else thinks you should be interested ing that counts. As a group of misfits eventually the find each other and relize that there are more important thing in life than depending on the opinions of someone else.
4,Good information,"There is a lot of good information in this book.Honestly though, the best part of it for me was that it is a great motivational tool listening to him."
4,coming soon to dvd in 2009,This is a great couple of dr. who shows. And they are scheduled for release on dvd in 2009. In the uk first of course. We won't see them till later in that year.
3,Not the best First Doctor airing,"Try as I might I cannot find a whole lot good to say about The Rescue save that it does not have Susan screaming throughout. That is perhaps a little unfair but this is a below par performance. William Hartnell is on good form but that cannot make up for the ropey story line and a lightweight production.The Romans is by far and away a superior story with an odd characterisation of how Nero came to fiddle with Rome burning. It is quite a clever angle but is a little incredulous given the timeframes of the individual sub-plots. That is a minor negative about this story which is actually rather a compelling view. I was never terribly interested in most of the historical stories but this one is the exception.Originally broadcast between 2 january 1965 and 6 February, this 2 cassette set is certainly worth having for the Romans alone. What did the Romans do for us?It is such a shame that some of the best stories are lost to posterity yet the Rescue is still available."
4,William Hartnell stories.,"Two stories on...erm, two tapes. The Rescue, despite only being two episodes long, is a great piece of sci-fi and a genuine classic. The Romans, however, is one of those stories you either love or hate. Though it's certainly very watchable (as long as you only watch it once), it's just not what Dr Who's about. Individually I'd give The Romans 3 stars and The Rescue 5, but this set is worth getting for The Rescue alone."
3,They couldn't make it nowadays!,"Ohmigod! Ian really *DID* say 'Cockylickin'! I thought that guy just made that up for that racy fanstory I read!Barbara just gunned down that poor girl's pet in cold blood, it died screetching in agony for a full two minutes then everyone bawled out the girl for crying over it.Where was Mary Whitehouse when you needed her, eh?Get these stories and go back to a time before TV knuckled under to the watchdog groups and lobotomized itself. Go back to when everything was a Monty Python/Saturday Night Live skit! Great stories!"
2,Bor-ring!,"The first story wasn't worth the time at all. It had nothing to it; only was there to introduce Vikki. Was episodes 10 and 11 from season 2.And then story 12 was just dragged out, where nothing was solved or accomplished, so seemed kind of pointless. Episodes 12-15 of season two.After both of these, I almost considered skipping the rest of the Hartnell years."
4,interesting but not thorough,"I also bought their guides for new mexico amd arizona, and really didin't need this guide after all--it touches the high points in each state, but in western kansas, e.g., it didn'ttouch on anything."
3,dont be fooled,"dont be fooled,while in my opinion pap is hip hop,this cd will let you down.every track is like a sample.there is not a single full song on the whole thing!!!just stick to his mixtapes and you'll be aigght.nacirema dream coming soon!!!"
5,Family Heirloom ???,"This book and it's sequal (Return to Yesterday) were originally my mother's books. When I was very young (around 6) I heard my mother telling my aunt about these two books and I never forgot them. When I was 18 or so I asked my mother who had written the books where the girl went into the swimming pool and traveled through time... I was amazed when she went into her room and produced the books. I read them the first time when I was 18 and have probably re-read them annually since then. It is truly a story that you will not soon forget (yet given how hard they are to find, will be reluctant to share)!"
5,This is a book you won't put down. Great story concept.,This is a book worthy of a movie concept. This romance novel is intertwined with a time warp concept that will keep you reading all night long.
4,"When you can't find it anywhere else, Amazon comes through!","I have been hunting for this book for years after losing my original copy. Although I think the condition was misrepresented (it is quite poor), I'm glad to have it."
2,"Looks nice, but no room...","I bought this bag when our first diaper bag started to tear. It looked big in the store, and the colors are not too loud. I got it home and started packing a day's worth of diapers, change of clothes and a few toys into it, and there was no room. It is great there are three bags, but unless you want to carry three bags around seperatly, they just do not hold very much. You could use it for running errands, but not for a babysitter if your child is going to be there longer than 3 hours. I will be returning and getting the Baby Innovations large bag."
3,nicely made...not enough room,I loved this bag in the store. It is nicely made and came with all the extras for a reasonable price...However...there is barely enough room ro pack just a days worth of baby neccessities. I have already removed all the tags...so I will keep it for short trips...and will now be in the market for something much roomier.
3,Gift for Baby Shower,"Not sure how long these last, but her baby is 8 months old and she doesn't use this diaper bag any more. I guess I can't really review this accurately because I felt weird about asking her where it was..."
1,my DVD does not work... complete Junk,Sadly - I could not get through the video - it did not work.Total junk.
4,Good for the money.,"This is a very interesting series to watch WWII from the perspective of America in the war. I am American and all of the patriotism is nice. But if you're looking for a well rounded documentary about the entire war, this series is probably not for you. I was looking for something that would show how Germany grew to power and how they went about starting the war, then how each individual country got involved. This does not have very much of that."
3,Dodgy American Releases,"After finally finding a copy of Doctor Who - The Trial of a Timelord I was very happy. Then I received it, a cheap American release of the original from the BBC.The tapes are not even labled and it comes badly put together in a cheap boxset. It just shows that USA skimps on most things these days and lacks the true British quality. Maybe this says something about USA?I recommend to find the PAL BBC UK version if possible. You will get your money worth and won't be dissapointed."
1,Don't understand the appeal,"I've been a Dr. Who fan since I was a child. I saw ""Trial of a Timelord"" as the dismal cap on a series run from greatness to ruin in a few short years. The ""trial"" plot is cobbled together to salvage the production of three incomplete episodes that were in various stages of completion when the BBC decided to put the show out of its misery. There's no doubt that the best of the Colin Baker era is here, but that is condemning with faint praise. The Sylvester McCoy era is sometimes worse, sometimes much better, but Dr. Who never regained the greatness it had from 1968-1980. I think you have to be a fan to enjoy this at all."
1,Absolutely Dreadfully BORING!,"""Trial of a Time Lord"" is the absolutely worst Dr Who I have ever seen and I like almost all of them. The script is inane and tedious. The plot is non-existent and the repartee between Colin Baker and Peri is monotonously repetitious. Words cannot express just how dreadful this long, 14 part torture really is."
4,Putting Trial on Trial,"The only way to review the Trial of a Time Lord season is to review each of its component parts.The Mysterious Planet (pts.1-4)-In my opinion, the best part of the whole set. Great sets, good characters, and an interesting story help it along. 5/5Mindwarp (pts.5-8)-Not as good as the preceeding story, but good in its own right. Sil is a great character, even if he isn't as cunning as in Vengeance on Varos. The ending will wow you. 4/5Terror of the Vervoids (pts.9-12)-This story has so much potential, but it's all destroyed by the terrible sets, the bland characters, and Mel. My least favorite of the season. 1/5The Ultimate Foe (pts 13,14)-This short wrap-up is miles better than Vervoids, but not as good as the previous two. Episode 13, with its big revelation, is far better than the final episode, which was written by the same people who wrote Vervoids. 3/5So the Trial season starts well, falters in the middle, and has a fair end."
5,"Small, but Impressive DVD Player","I bought this at least 2 years ago. We took it on several car trips and it held up just fine with two boys! We also took it along on several flights to keep the boys occupied. My only complaint is that the sound is too low, but if you use earphones it is fine. The other day, I brought it to my room to watch a movie and it was hard to hear without using earphones.I'm trying to find a cable so we can hook it up to the TV. I can't remember if it came with one or not, but we have lost it if it did."
5,My Little Girl's LOVED this lamp! So much Fun!,Both of my girls LOVED this fun lamp. They had so much fun watching the Pincess dance and sing around the light! it looks great in a Princess themed room!
5,very engrossing,"I watched this version of edith wharton's novel years ago , and am still thinking about it today . It's very well acted and beautifully produced. Also, It is pretty closely adapted from the book."
3,STARTS OUT BAD BUT WORKS IT WAY TO EXCELLENT!,"This movie started out so bad that I had a hard time forcing myself to keep watching it. I am very glad I did though, 3/4 of the movie is excellent and definitely worth watching. It is coming out on DVD soon and hopefully they will leave the 3rd tape off. The entire 3rd tape is just about the movie, a waste of tape."
3,yawn,"yeah, the costumes and locations were great but if you are ex-pecting a story by Edith Wharton....well, you'll be disappointed. The main female character in the video is nothing like what I believe Ms. Wharton had in mind. In thevideo Nan is a simpering gut-less wonder. And whatever happenedto lizzie Elmsworth sister? Read the book instead."
1,YUCK!,That was my first thought. Absolutely NOT a good family movie. Very displeased. No value at all in this movie. It was not worth watching! What I saw were several selfish girls who had no thought as to what was right or wrong. Please do not get this movie. It's miserable.
4,an outstanding piece of music,"This unknown Polish artist introduces his listeners to the unique climate of the so called ""singing poetry"". The majority of both his lyrics and melodies are composed by himself. Unfortunately, since it is the lyrics that matter, the works of this artist are not accesible to non-Polish speakers. At least, you can listen to his music and ask a Polishh speaker to help you in understanding. I highly recommend it to everyone interested in ballads, poetry, etc."
4,Turnau is great ! !,"I have only one question: where can I buy a new album ""Ultima"" in Internet ? Thank You !"
4,Cards ARE included,The only review posted for this book says the memory cards are NOT included. My package came with a set of cards for 60 verses in 4 different translations and a card carrying case. I am looking forward to using these cards and the manual to aid in my attempt to memorize Scripture.
3,Good book but cards are not included,"This book has a lot of good ideas and methods for memorizing scripture, but the scripture memorization card are not included, which is principally the reason I bought the book. A little disappointing"
4,Can't. Stop. Looking.,"What were they thinking?! I mean, I can understand the roguish impulse to shoot naughty pictures of yourself and even to post them on the Internet. I've done it a time or two myself. But those lamps! And that wretched sofa!This is a delightfully diverting little book. If there's a flaw, it's that it's too short by far. You can't put it down and you can't look away from these decorating disasters so, in the end, you want more, more, more deliciously awful decor to punish your eyes.Or perhaps I'm just some sort of weird interior design masochist. It's possible."
5,laugh out loud,"I defy anyone to not just love this eccentric tongue-in-cheek look at decorating. It takes interior design and skews it with hilarious results. Clever, original, and only slightly obscene. (And I'm talking about the rooms...!) A great urban gift."
2,cannot make outgoing calls (defective unit),"I needed an inexpensive basic phone which would work during a power failure. The one I received can receive calls and the sound quality is OK, but I cannot make outgoing calls because only the ""1"" button works. If the outgoing dialing had worked, I would have rated this a ""4"" based on its value. But since it does not, it is rather useless and the low price is not worth the hassle and expense of dealing with an RMA."
4,Bought for niece and nephew and they loved it,"I bought this game for my niece and nephew for Christmas and they love it. I didn't play it at all but my mom played it with the kids and said it was really cute and that they loved it. It was much smaller than I was expecting, about the size of an altoids container but that would great for keeping in your purse for outings at restaurants, plane trips, etc."
2,Have run into some problems...,"I was excited about this player, with it's ability to convert my DVD titles to 720p on my new plasma TV. The picture quality is ok, for the most part. The problem is, the picture keeps going in and out, as if there is a short or something. I thought it was my cheaper HDMI cable at first, so I paid 50 extra dollars for a Monster Cable to iron out the problem. Now, it seems like the picture has digressed, and it continues to go in and out on occasion. It looks like I'll have to return it, and I'm already down 50 bucks for having to get the cable. I'd say it's an unnecessary hassle, and I wish I'd have purchased a different upconversion DVD player."
1,This dvd player has 5 months life.,"I bought this dvd player 5 months back. I was happy i could convert to 720p and 1080i. I was good until couple of days back, it started switching off itself and on. While playing, it switches off and comes back on. This player comes with 3 month labor, 1 year parts. Now if i need to fix it, it costs about 70$. I recommend not to buy this DVD player"
3,Unusual perspective from a catholic priest in the waffen SS,"I read this book some twenty years back when I was at high school and in a war phase. However, the book stayed with me as a unusual story from a misguided catholic priest who apprently was a chaplain in the murderous Waffen SS in WWII. Himmler himself gave despensation for this priest to operate, not bad considering catholics were next on the list after jehovahs witnesses. Dispite all this, love to get a hold of this book."
4,One of those gems...,"This cd is one of those payoffs for the countless hours(when I have the time) spent browsing every nook and cranny in the World Music bins at several stores. The accompanying booklet is loaded with artist info. I like all of the tracks but my favorite is Rokia Traore's ""Layou""...simply mesmerizing. This label is new to me but the disc fits quite nicely in the platter right alongside music from Putumayo and Rough Guide. I highly recommend this one!"
1,Very poorly written...,"This book is so poorly written that I could not even make it past the first 20 pages. The sentences sound like they were constucted by a 6th grader, and the text is filled with grammatical and spelling errors (not to mention it looks like it was typecast in someone's basement). I recently read a book that was written by an ex-mafia inmate that had better grammar, sentence formation and drama.It's amazing to me that this book got published in its current form. It could stand a rewrite and some ""professional"" editing."
1,I DONT KNOW ABOUT THIS 1,i didnt like it. i thought the writer sounded kind of stupid. this book makes sheehan look like a stunod.
4,Great gift idea especially for first-time parents,"This is a great gift idea. I bought this for myself wanting to use it for my second baby's stuff. I was disappointed to see that the box is not that big and will not hold a lot of your baby's mementoes, but then the touching baby pictures, the passages in the journals, the book -- they are a surprise bonus. Also, the journals (2 separate journals for the pregnancy and for the baby) are blank pages of beautiful paper so it will be a little more difficult to fill the pages in without the usual questions/guides that other baby/pregnancy books have. All in all though, for the price that I paid for this purchase, I am very happy with what I got. I would want to buy more for my pregnant family members and friends."
1,Terrible product - Ink leaking,Stay away from this. 3 out of the 4 inks were leaking in the box when they arrived. Spend the extra money to buy the original canon inks.
1,Poor delivery,ordered 5-24 for an event on 6-4. It is 6-7-06 and still have not received product. Supplier has not responded to email inquiries about delivery.
4,Great product. Recommended by teachers.,This program was recommended to us by our son's teacher to help him with his keyboard skills as he was recently diagnosed with a writing disability.The product arrived new and I recommend this seller as it arrived very promptly. Our son loves it and is learning very quickly.KVa Beach
4,Soothing Country Rhythms,"I really enjoy the Mystical Moods albums. I purchased two more after my husband bought Nature's Bounty. For someone who likes guitar and relaxing, contemplative country-like melodies, this CD is right up their alley. I myself prefer sax and keyboard in my relaxing smooth jazz or ""spa"" music. The melodies in Nature's Bounty are original and bring to mind walking on a Vermont country road in the summer, or looking over a harvest. Very nice."
3,It's not THAT good,"It's a little wordy, Empson goes on and on in some places and doesn't explain very well in others."
1,A distinct lack of quality control,"This book starts on page 225 and when it reaches page 256, starts over at page 17. Then, at the end, it repeats pages 225 to 256. Was there any quality control for this 'new' book?"
2,"Used twice for baking, now will use for crafts.","I wanted to try something new so I bought this spring form pans even after reading others reviews. I only used them twice making cheesecake and now they are rusted. Not all is lost, I will use them with plaster to have my grandchildren make hand plaques in the near future."
3,So So pans for a value price,These pans are not the best quality but you can't complain for the price. If you're looking for high quality then try another product.
1,Shabby doesn't begin to describe these pans.,"I bought my set about a year ago. I've only used the 10"" pan four times. I use it for cheesecake and aside from it leaking like a sieve, it's worked pretty well. Today, without any indication of problems, the nonstick surface decided to stick to the cake rather than the pan. It looked like someone painted my cake black. I wish I could give a ""0"" rating."
1,Finish peels off,I've had these for about 4 years. They are definitely NOT non-stick pans. When I have run a sharp knife between the cheese cake and the pan to make it release - the coating just starts peeling off like paper. It's done it on all 3 pans. I need to throw these in the trash and get new ones!
3,"cheap product, cheap price","I thought this product was worth what I paid for it. It worked great for the cakes I made, but when I used it for a cheesecake I was a little worried that the waterbath might leak. It either leaked, or the butter from the crust melted, not really sure which."
1,piece of junk...........,"very very cheap material. waste of money, dont buy this product ever. instead of this buy BAKERS SECRET springform cake pans.bakers secret pans are made with really good material and are long lasting.i was very disappointed with SUNBEAM 3 PIECE NON STICK SPRINGFORM SET."
1,Cheap Crap!,"I guess it's true that ""They just don't make'em like they used to"". Yeah, the spring form pan lasted through exactly two cakes before the rivets popped out. I try to buy brand name items but I guess it's been a long time since Sunbeam made anything good.Well... No more Sunbeam for me. This was a cheap piece of crap."
1,Not Recommended,I purchased this book because I thoroughly enjoyed the two earlier crime novels by Meyer that were published in the U. S. -Dead At Daybreak and Heart of the Hunter. This book was apparently written earlier and does not compare favorably. The plot is improbable. The violence gratuitous and graphic. It is not an enjoyable read unless you enjoy vivid descriptions of human savagery. My hope is that we will have no more retrospective publications of Meyer's work because I think he is an excellent writer and going forward will produce some more really good stuff.
3,Not bad,"I had high expectations for this book, and was unfortunately disappointed. One thing I think that didn't work in Deon Meyer's favour was the more-often-than-not bad translation from Afrikaans to English. Sometimes the direct translation didn't give the story or characters the power they deserved. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either."
4,Dead before Dying,"I love Deon Meyers characters and the way the plot comes together at the end. This was no exception and kept you guessing, at the same time enjoying the different characters."
3,Good reading,"Deon Meyer use the same main characters in his books, Matt Joubert, Bennie Griesel which makes it exciting. This is the story of Matt Joubert. It is a good story but not as good as 13 Hours."
3,Dead before dying,I enjoyed particularly the psychology of crime fighters and the conflicts with their personal lives. Racial issues are well handled.
3,Not his best book for sure,"I really enjoy most of the Meyer books and feel he deserves to be far more popular in North America than he is at present.However, this was my least favorite book. 50% of it deals with Joubert's psychology, a death wish due to the death of his wife under circumstances that make it particularly difficult for Mat to cope.But if I wanted this type of book, that's what I would have bought. I want a South African police mystery type of novel and most of Meyer's books are exactly that. It's great to read about life and culture in Capetown instead of the typical New York Chicago or LA setting.I have read seven other Meyer books and would rate those as a four or five but this one is certainly not of that calibre. If you decide to read his work for the first time, start with one of the other books."
3,Ok,"I was recommended this author by a friend and immediately downloaded the first 6 of his books. It's was the first one I read and although I enjoyed the Cape Town setting of the novel, I could not help feel that the author's natural language is Afrikaans and a few of the phrases just did not ring true in English. Still a good plot and fun read though."
1,Not at all what I was expecting! Smells and Tastes NASTY!,This tea is terrible. I read other reviews before purchasing. Other reviews compared it to the cheesecake factory mango iced tea. This tea is NOTHING like it. It has a fowl smell and tastes just like it smells. I doubt I will ever drink any mango flavored tea again after this. There is no way I can drink it and it is not returnable. I never write product reviews but was so disappointed I had to in this case.
1,Disappointed,"I absolutely love this product but disappointed with the shipping. Delivery estimate is 08/23/12-09/13/12. Received a tiny package on 28/24/12 but when I opened the package there was only one Vicco Turmeric cream inside. I ordered 2 turmeric creams and 2 vanishing turmeric creams. Contacted seller to see if the the remaining 3 items were shipped separately but never got a response from the company. They still have until September 13 to fulfill my order, so I'm waiting to see what will happen by then before filing a claim."
5,Very effective for acne,"I used this in the hope of getting my skin clear of the persistent acne that I've been having. I've intermittently used 5 or 10% benzoyl peroxide creams. They seem to work fine. But there were too many problems.1. My skin was getting painfully dry. I had to use a moisturizer after application.2. I always had to wash my face before I applied it. And if I happen to put the cream on my clothes, they used to get bleached.Over all, this was a huge chore. Now, this cream works wonders. I've been using this for a week. My skin's never been so clear. And what's more,it works like a good moisturizer as well. I tend to use it for 2-3 times a week. Also, try covering you acne spots with this cream and leave it over night. That worked well for me."
2,"Smells nice and is non-greasy, but has harmful ingredients","I ordered this turmeric skin cream because I have tried their Vicco toothpaste before and like it. So I thought that the Vicco lotion must also be nice and a natural product. I used it for about a month and like the fact that it's non-greasy and goes on smoothly.But yesterday I checked the ingredient list out of curiosity. I noticed that the lotion includes Methyl Paraben Sodium and Propyl Paraben, which are harmful preservatives according to the Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Database ([...]). Harmful ingredients like this get absorbed by the skin and enter the bloodstream.For sure I will not use this lotion anymore, even though I liked the smell of it and its lightweight feel. I wonder why they use a chemical preservative, since they could just use Vitamin C and E as a natural alternative."
5,My miracle cure for Acne!,"I have oily skin, which, couple with hormonal changes, results in at least 4-5 pimples a month. Add to the fact that if I touch my face with dusty hands, I get huge pimples that never turn into whiteheads until they are a little lava mountain on the face. Jokes apart, it can be very embarassing.I've tried garnier pure pen for my acne, which speeds up the acne life cycle to get rid of it. Vicco turmeric actually cures the infected area, and dries it without messy breakage. It does take a bit longer for the pimple to go, but it doesn't get reinfected. This saved me on my wedding day when a dried dust pimple left a bump on my face- i applies a blob of this overnight and by morning, the bump was almost gone, and easily covered by basic makeup.This is a herbal remedy I completely trust for my acne problem, and have used for the past ten years. No side effects, my ultra sensitive skin likes it, and no burning when I put it on. What more can I ask for!"
2,This is 50 mg NOT 70 mg be warned,"Love this cream have been using it for years. I didn't see it at first though this is the 50 mg version which is not what I expected, so just be sure to read the weight/ volume as this cream comes in all kinds of sizes. My fault, should have read more thoroughly. Not a giant difference in cost, this one costs slightly more, just warning others. Also, I find having shipping multiply by $4.99 for EACH item is ludicrous if ordering multiple items from this seller, i.e. 3x quantity comes to 3x shipping = $14.97 !!! (its also called ""Turmeric"" not Tormeric."" :-)"
3,Item arrived opened.,"I bought the item based on the positive reviews, but when it arrived, the box had been previously opened. There were certain numbers scratched off the tube as well as the package. Has this only happened to me?"
3,Ok,I don't really know how much this works. I was using it on my cat because she had a small cyst below her eye. I used it for months but it didn't do anything. I don't know if that's what it was supposed to be used for but if it is it doesn't work.
1,Terrible cream esp for me,"My mom had acne and she used vicco... Her skin is glowing and beutiful(ah grew up in India) but vicco didn't cure her scars. She was also drinking lemon juice in the mornings.I tries vicco... I had a small patch of pimples that I wanted to get rid of... One week with vicco and BAM! I never had such severe acne, scars and cystic bumps. I always thought that the stinging meant that that its working but no. It's soooo horrible I had numerous steam facials and products to clear the acne. Now I use clearasil ultra rapid acne wipes and at night apply KATHA POWDER(make a paste with water) and apply at night. That's all. I tried everything, proactive benzoyl, lemon turmerix. everything. DON'T USE VICCO IF U GREW UP DRINKING HORMONE FILLED PRODUCTS OR IF U HAVE OILY skin. It's a waste"
1,Made me breakout with pimples all over,Purchased this product at a local indian grocery store and the lady recommended me this. Got multiple cysts on my cheeks and little small pimples all over my forehead and temples.. what the heck! I had just gotten done clearing up my forehead with my clarisonic and now I'm back to square one with acne. This product sucks!
5,Great product that works,"This product is natural and really works. It has helped with such things as minor blemishes, rashes, minor sunburns, etc. I really like this product as it also smells good (Sandalwood), but the smell dissipates after a little bit and it isn't too strong. I also like the Amazon service. It was fast and easy."
4,nice cream,"this cream has a strong-ish scent (which i am ok with, but if you are sensitive to smell, be forewarned). i personally find it to be a pleasant scent- very clean and almost floral. the cream itself absorbs quickly and makes the skin feel soft. i have not noticed any lightening effects as of yet (i've been using at night for about a month). a nice cream, especially for the price."
4,Standard downpipe,"Straight forward downpipe. It's a 2 piece pipe so it's easier to put in. I bought it from this seller for $76 and free shipping so if it's more expensive than that, theres a ton of 2 piece down pipes out there for under $100."
1,This is not a replacement for MA361!,"This is not a replacement for MA361. It barely fit in the handset and it gets overheated, the handset is hot when it stays in the base, charging. The cord is too long and from the top of the battery, not the bottom, as the original was."
3,too big,I didn't realize how large this fanny pack was. It is useful but I would have preferred it a little smaller. I do like the spacious compartments.
5,Product good and great price,"This is a very good product at a very good price , I would recommend this product and site to my friends."
3,very big but of good construction,Purchased to use as a conceal and carry pouch. Works ok for this purpose but I should of got one smaller in size. Really not meant for this and no way to fast draw your gun but ok just for a place to store it.
3,Useful,"I purchased two of these for our Disney trip, one held up one didn't. My daughter used hers teh entire week mine came apart at the seam by the second day. These are large which is why I bought them, big enough to hold you wallet, pocket camera, and other items... I think I just received one defective one but can only give a three star rating since one became unusable otherwise it would have been a 5."
5,Fanny Pack Review,"Perfect size for carrying extra ski gear during uncertain weather conditions. Goggles, sunglasses, camera, sun block fit conveniently when you run out of pocket space."
3,It'll be OK,"The pack will be ok for my needs. The 16 1/2"" width as stated is not correct. I thought the whole pouch would be 16 1/2 inches wide. The actual measurement the entire width where pouch is hooked to the belt is only 14"". All that I can get in the last 1 1/2"" on either side is my finger. Actual usable space for the width is more like 11"" wide near the top. I can still use this but not for the original purpose. Since I couldn't see this before I buy it the measurements should show the usable space and should be correct."
3,big,"I wasn't sure if size meant the waist size or bag size. Apparantly it meant the bag size. It's a little bigger than we expected and not as inconspicuous as my father had hoped. Still a nice made bag, but for my father's purpose, he liked medium better."
4,Fabric Pack,"It is a nice pack, I wish it was alittle larger. But it is exactly how it is described. Thank you"
1,lies and propaganda,"' men are better than women"" this sexism got humor points and got 4 stars on this sight Truth is..female is the norm to avoid. "" play like a girl, sissy extra"", the norm in movies to rap music. don't tell a woman to hit back and then cry faul play. Fact:: agenda to break down family and stir competition between genders started by crowledy who wanted women gone, so homosexuality could reign, the bohemian homesexual grove continues today, and satanist levy started the stereotype of the eye candy sex object, your slave exploiting you. Church of satan admits to producing media to cleanse society of christianity. N.w.orobot agenda,starts with dehumanizing women, sexualizing machines and get you used to adrogny. Adrogyny also serves to convery straight males. This book is reheteric."
4,Farrell's Inside Look at Feminism,"An ex-member of the board of the NY City chapter of NOW, an experienced marital counselor,and a respected researcher of gender issues, Warren Farrell has experienced feminism from both sides. His newest book, ""WOMEN CAN'T HEAR WHAT MEN DON'T SAY"", provides an excellent perspective on feminisms'influence on social attitudes toward men. Must reading for every fathers'/mens'rights activist, or anyone interested in a balanced view of gender politics."
3,2 valuable chapters and a bunch of rant,"The first two chapters of the book (about giving and receiving criticism) are excellent - written in a very accessible manner and with practical and useful steps to use the advice provided. After that, though, the book turns into a long-winded rant about how men need more recognition for contributions in the home and a bunch of other stuff that has NOTHING to do with improving communications. While I appreciate the author's mission to raise awareness about men's issues, I really wish he had stuck with concrete communications advice.I was thinking to take a workshop by the author. After reading the book, I've decided not to."
2,chatty and churchy,"Without a doubt, there are Christian resonances in Tolkien that are worth discussing, but Wright's methodology is rather heavy-handed. Wright does his best to impose an evangelical perspective on Tolkien with an emphasis on dogma rather than a sensitive reading of Tolkien. Moreover, Wright's conversational style would work well in a talk, but becomes irritating in a book. No index."

4,Priceless performance from Sir Alec Guinness,"While not without imperfections this film had a powerful story to tell. It's not a new idea, making a film about a group of strangers thrown together and showing how they learn to relate to each other. But these particular actors were outstanding and the film builds beautifully toward the final scenes when a few heart-rending twists are added. Keep your kleenex handy! What about the imperfections? Well, I get tired of the worn-out characterization of the bar girl with the good heart. And then there was the fact that everyone in the movie is trying to anesthetize their pain with alcohol. There was some language, but it was not gratuitous. Alec Guinness was the stand-out star of this film."
3,A Foreign Field,"I gave this movie to my 70+ year old father who has an interest in W.W. II and he loved it. It is both funny and moving and has a great cast. He has visited the battle fields of France and felt this to be a very realistic depiction of what it is like today.I found it to be slightly less entertaining than he did, but it was still a good movie."
3,Good Movie,We enjoyed this movie but it did drag in some places. The actors were good and so was the script.
4,Heavy artillery given light calibre rounds.,"Many of these actors are considered acting ""deity"" (and justifiably so), the story line was original and the locations were authentic. When you see a cadre of heavy-hitting talent assembled you expect equally heavy-hitting dialogue. Very little was there. I gave it four stars due to the first three and perhaps what could have been."
5,absolutely marvelous film - must buy,Was fortunate enough to have taped this when it was shown on PBS' Masterpiece theatre and have anxiously awaited for it to be released on dvd.truly one of the best to watch over and over again...there are a few light-hearted moments but get your hankies or kleenex out.the entire cast is simply superb.
5,D-Day's effect years later with humor and sadness,"A sleeper. I fortunately saw Foreign Field on TV several years ago and remembered it. With the current interest in WW II Europe, this movie provides a different viewpoint than the tremendous violence of combat. No mud, no blood and the sun is shining. Wryly humorous at the start, it segues into an emotional end. Not a dry eye in the house."
4,Good but could be better,"We travel a fair bit and the idea of being able to bring a ""proper stroller"" with us is great. The bag is well made and quite tough and also easy to use. It has been very useful.I do wish they would make a bugaboo travel bag with a hard shell. Even though the bag is made out of quite strong fabric (and also padded) they do throw this around with the other bags and suitcases at the airport(not seeming to understand its a stroller), and it has gotten quite beaten up. (No major damages on stroller)."
4,kept bugaboo safe,How do you rate a product that you buy to keep another expensive product safe? It did what it was supposed to do. I was surprised at how heavy it was once packed....since you are not used to carrying the bugaboo in this manor. I loved havinig the stroller at the other end of the trip and it came apart and went back together well.
4,Well designed,"No complaints. Easy to figure out, easy to load, easy to wheel and keeps it all together in a high quality bag!"
1,It was not what I order.,"OK, I don't know what is wrong with the picture in this toy, the picture does not matches the product I got, I order a drum with a stick but I got like a rattle that the baby spins and make a noise, my baby is 22months and I though she will like it anyways but not attentions at all.So if you buy it make sure is what you want, I don't know if I can still return it cause I lost the box:("
2,Not For The Chubby,"These bags are perfect for most in the rainbow of flavors available. They're a decent bag for the price, and since they can be color coordinated, one can even afford to buy several and refer to themselves as fashionable with any outfit while avoiding tugging along a more traditional purse. The only caution I would offer any would be buyer is don't believe the rather generous claim that it fits waists up to size 42. You can manage to attach this bag to your midriff bulge at size 42, just don't plan on eating anything heavy for the duration, (like a pack of gum.) If you're one of the unfortunates that have a little more to carry around these days, move up to one of the other bags featured on Amazon that are a little more generous with a strap up to 48"". You'll look better on your outing, and don't even have to worry if someone suggests a buffet...."
5,Excellent source for the non-engineer.,"What really sets this book apart is the approach: a clear and concise guide to various suspension systems that remains objective through every discussion. The language is technical enough to convey appropriate meaning, yet examples are clear enough that you can understand what's going on even if your diploma doesn't include the word ""engineer.""There's a bit of unnecessary repetition, and the author makes it quite clear that designers and engineers are usually at odds. But if you get around this (and learn when to skip a paragraph or two), you'll find a book that's surprisingly easy to read (given the subject matter) and thoughtful in its execution."
2,Not as Pictured,These envelopes would be perfect other than I missed the fine print or the picture is wrong. The ones I received are not self sealing. You must fold over the top and seal them with tape. Other than that they are great.
4,Really a must!,"If you don't plan to buy all of early Kora & Maanam recordings, it is really a must! There is also another great compilation called ""Rockandrolle"", I think it is even better! Kora & Maanam are the best, I love them! Can you imagine the Rolling Stones with a female vocalist? No? See Kora & Maanam live!"
2,"Okay, but not worth reprinting","This is an unassuming booklet of 80 pages. Some booklets can be real gems but this one is just what it appears. Apparently it was intended as the inexpensive alternative for those who felt the textbook by Panshin & de Zeeuw was too much. As such it is OK. With its small b&w; pictures of somewhat indifferent quality it is no match for Hoadley's ""Identifying_Wood"".To but it bluntly: if anybody interested in identifying wood were offered his choice between this booklet for free or Hoadley's book at full price the value-for-money choice would definitely be to buy Hoadley's ""Identifying_Wood"". In its day this could pass, but 1980 is a long time ago."
5,a great film!,"Ricardo Montalban and Jane Powell shine in this film So does Debbie Reynolds. It's a great film, and I highly recommend it!It's entertaining."
4,Great read - don't have to be Catholic to love it,"I met the author in the early 1970's. My high school book club loved his book and we invited him to visit us way out in the boondocks. He came and talked about his 2 books, Chicago, life, and writing. He was very genuine and funny. (John, thanks so much visiting us.) Looks like I have a collector's item now. He turned the book into a play (a musical as I recall) sometime in the late 70's to early 80's."
2,A quasi-fictional memorium,"I must confess I did not finish this book. It is probably ""inside cleverness"" to those who are Catholics and want to reminisce. If you want a quaint slice of what it was like a few decades ago, this book could be for you."
1,Great title,But so slow moving ! Growing up catholic and attending convent school I expected more insight and relevancy and absurdity.
2,Not that funny - a Catholic boy book and not a Catholic girl book.,"I grew up a Catholic and went to Catholic schools in the Chicago suburbs. My boyfriend also grew up Catholic and raved about how funny this book was and said I just had to read it.Like another reader, ""I couldn't wait to finish this book, hoping it would get better.....it didn't. It is an ok book but not great"".The nuns when I grew up were Stalinists to put it mildly. I laughed sometimes but not that often. I think a boy and the ""dirty book"" thing, etc. would relate more to a boy than a girl.It did bring back some memories---the Baltimore Catechism, practicing for First Holy Communion, mission fund raising, etc. but I think boys that went to Catholic school would relate more."
1,Can not burn a DVD,The program to make and edit vidios is really pretty good. The problem I have encounterd like many others is that the DVD burner is full of bugs in this version. I had to pay $75 for software to burn the DVD after I had spend countless hours making my video. I Suggest you look for a later version.
1,"Not user friendly, Adobe won't offer support","We purchased Adobe photoshop elements 6 and premiere elements 4 as a package in late 2007. It was not user friendly software at all, but after much painful reasearch we were able to perform basic tasks. (The main purpose of the software was to create slideshows and burn them to DVDs, and even that wasn't easy to figure out.) Last year it worked well on our old computer, but when we got a new computer with Windows Vista it wouldn't work. I can create slidewhows, but I get an error message every time I hit the button to burn them do a DVD. I called adobe for some help, AND THEY DON'T OFFER SUPPORT FOR PREMIERE ELEMENTS 4.0 ANYMORE. It's only two years old. I guess if you don't fork out the cash to upgrade every year, adobe isn't interested in helping you.Terrible product. Terrible support. It has raised my blood pressure substantially in the past few weeks, and I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY."
1,Stay away from this piece of crap,"I read other reviews and decided to buy this as part of the Premier Elements + PhotoShop ELements bundle. It took almost 20 min to install this on a machine with 1g ram,Pentium 1.8ghz box! Its really heavy weight for what it provides. It cant even burn a VCD. So much for creating mpegs!! I cant even figure out how to create a compressed version of video directly from my camera. I always end up with a 20gb fileset. Editing is a pain too! This software must be developed by a team who have no idea of how to write a usable software . Surely this software is on the other end of spectrum compared to PhotoShop Elements. Shame on you Adobe for tricking cusotmers to buy this along with Photoshop Elements when you should be giving this for free! I should have tried the demo before I had bought this :(."
1,Premiere faulters with mpegs and DVD cams,"Well I bought this product along with a Sony DVD201E, thinking it was perfect for my job. I'd be able to video people then turn them directly into mpegs on my laptop. The age of the mobile creative worker had truly arrived. The first transfer over USB of my files using Sony's inbuilt software was seemless. Reading those files into Premiere, all looked fine. In fact the files played well. But when the files were moved into editing there was a complete loss of sound. Exporting into whatever file format had the same problem. So, back into ImageMixer, which Sony supplied with the camera. I could export into other MPEG formats. Sadly, Premiere handled all of these badly. So, now I'm off to purchase ULead, which other reviews on the net reckon works well. Let's hope."
2,terrible support from Adobe,"I wanted a more extensive video editor than Microsoft's Movie Maker for digital movie clips. Still shots download easily, but video (AVI) files appear to freeze the program and do not download into the program. Zero support from Adobe and after uninstalling and reinstalling 3 times, I am using Movie Maker again."
1,Worst software - waste of money,"Crashes every time I try to import a MPEG clip. Considering this is what my videocamera shoots in, this software is useless to me. Fixes on the Adobe support website and user forums have not worked. Telephone support is non-existent unless you want to pay twice as much as the software costs for only a 1-year agreement. Run, don't walk, and buy another software package."
1,I could not modify a simple slide show,"I made a simple slide show, with music. Then the trouble started. I could not figure out how to adjust time of each slide and could not adjust transitions. Instructions and tutorials were hopelessly wrong or confusing. After five hours of trying all sorts of combinations, I give up. Its back to wonderful PowerPoint, FlipAlbum and Adobe Album, all easier to use. Is there anyway to change the itme on screen of all slides or the transition of all slides without having to change each of 300 slides manually? The instructions do not work. Sorry but I do not think this is a good product and am disappointed."
3,"Good for DV, but...","This program does not support anything but 720x480 resolution for NTSC or the corresponding PAL resolution. For DV project sources, this is a non-issue. If you've captured footage from your analog camcorder at 352x480 and give it to PE as imported media, it assumes that you want your final project to have a distorted picture with wide black margins on the sides, i.e. it assumes your source has 'missing' pixels. If your using PE for the straight and narrow, (DV in/out or DVD out) it's probably fine. If you're looking for a general purpose movie editor that accepts a wide variety of input formats and has the flexibility to create a wide variety of output formats, don't buy PE."
1,Do not buy - this an old version.,It is not labeled as such - but this is the old version of Adobe Premiere (v. 1.0). Instead one should buy the Adobe Premiere v. 2.0 which is more current and is also listed at Amazon.
4,WARNING! Read dimensions before purchase.,Once I opened the package with the Mini Nut Knot I was shocked. It was my fault for not reading the description but the ball was $6.66 for something so so small. I won't buy it again because of the price and size. It really is 2.5 inches x 2.5 inches. I gave the product 4 stars because they it is exactly what they said it is.
2,"A great toy, IF YOU GET THE LARGER SIZE.","I was really excited that I found these for so cheap. They were smaller than the ones that I had gotten before, but I thought they would at least hold together better than they ended up doing.These toys are AWESOME for gerbils, if you get a larger size. The large ones occupied my gerbils for a month before they finally tore it apart enough to get the treat inside. These are much, much smaller, lasted maybe only a couple hours before they were totally eaten up. Definitely not worth it when shipping was as much as it was. I was very disappointed. I'm just going to stick to toilet paper tubes as toys..."
5,Absolutely amazing,"It's mind-boggling that Cecile Kayirebwa is so unknown. Her music is just incredible...sure, there are a couple of tracks that I'm not crazy about, but the others are just soul-searching, breathtaking pieces. I can't stop listening. It's worth it to find a copy of this cd - it's clearly been discontinued because people aren't buying it, but it is WELL worth it..."
4,Much better than your typical same old same old,"The GoodA chunky repetitive riff is prevails on ""Get Steady."" Jonny has a smooth vocal delivery, with a slight echo effect added. The chorus has a hook that's sure to stick with you for a while. When Jonny launches into his solo, he adds a cool guitar affect that really stands out. Jonny switches to a clean tone for the pop-rock tinged ""Love Conspiracy."" ""Breaking Down"" is an all acoustic number with catchy vocal patterns. Power chords dominate ""Clich?,"" which is anything but. ""Lost My Mind"" really separates itself from the back, as it sounds like a lost rock song from the fifties.The BadNothing notableThe VerdictThe one thing that struck a chord with me was Jonny's diversity. Even though this is just an EP, it displays several different styles and arraignments. It is so much better than your typical same old same old. I look forward to the completed album."
1,"2006 PC Cillin worked great, 2007 is a disaster","Our company as well as myself used PC Cillin in 2006 and renewed it in 2007. The 2006 version did not slow our systems down like the 2007 version does. I have also experienced problems with the 2007 software that never surfaced on 2006. It took some time to figure out but all of our e-mail programs stopped working and didn't start again until I quite PC Cillin. Everytime I rebooted the computer our e-mail would not work until PC Cillin was quit. The problems of the software became so great that I had to uninstalled it today, many months before our subscription runs out.We have had the 2007 version since February(?) but many of the problems did not start to surface until lately. It makes me believe that there are problems with their updates.I would consider other anti virus software before this one."
2,"okay not great, would not buy again","software easy to use, but customer support stinks. it always states i need to update software, but never allows me to connect to their server to get the updates. would try another product"
1,Lose My Internet Connection,"I've used Trend Micro antivirus 2005 and 2006 without difficulty. However, I lose my internet connection when I install the 2007 version. Trend's tech support just told me to uninstall and reinstall the software, which I had already tried without success."
2,Just When I Thought I Had Found a Perfect Virus Protection,"I bought one for my mother too-She runs Windows ME- It will not install on ME and TrendMicro does not support it. I had to purchase a download from TrendMicro and we all know how that goes--Anyway the one I bought for myself-Windows XP, installed easily but when you try to manually scan, there is a problem--- I have had PC Cillin for 4 years and alas I feel that this will be my last year-- Too bad to, I really enjoyed the ease and simplicity of prior years"
1,"Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy",The dock is flimsy and the ipod wobbles in its cradle and 'disconnects' from the Mac if wiggled just a little. They don't tell you that it won't charge when connected to USB. Their 'optional AC Adapter' should have been included but can't be found anywhere-even from their own site. I would NOT recommend this.
4,Works better than advertised,"Fits my iPod 4G fine. Essentially the same white color, so looks fine, too. While the instruction sheet says """"charging function does not work via USB connection"" the iPod says it IS charging when plugged into my PC's USB 2.0 add-in board USB port. (Perhaps instructions refer to ue with USB 1.1?)Only unknown is that the small LED on front of cradle does not light, as I think is intended. (Since I do not have a Firewire cable to test how its would work, I can't speak to that approach.)"
1,Word of Caution,My iPod Mini fried with this product. Luckily it was under warranty and Apple replaced it.
3,Beautiful but not for everyday wear,This is a beautiful watch but I'm not sure how it would hold up under everyday use. The crystals go halfway around the watch band. For my wrists I would have to take several links out to be not too big; therefore the crystals would be almost all the way around. That isn't so bad for looks but I can see how over time the shiny silver part and the crystals would get really scrathced up on the bottom and maybe even the crystals fall out. I was also a little disappointed that for this price it didn't give the date on the face of the watch. It also had just a small clasp so if it came undone on your wrist you could easily lose it and not even know it was off your wrist. I loved the mother of pearl face and overall it was stunning. Maybe this is just a dress watch.
2,Stopped working after 7 months :(,"I'm so disappointed. I was SO excited to get this watch. It's really beautiful and looks classy and expensive. However, the quality of this watch is just not worth it. I experienced a few times that the watch stopped but after fiddling with the set button it would start again. Now, it does not work at all! So I spent $70 for 7 months. I will try to work with Anne Klein to get it repaired but who has time for all that??? And is it really worth the headache? Perhaps it's really worthwhile to spend another $100 and get a swiss watch which will last much much longer without issues. I regret my purchase and wish I would have spent the extra $100..."
2,Exactly the same as the regular Intuos2 Pen,"but 20 dollars more and hideous. I have a platinum Intuos2 tablet (a high school graduation present from 2004), and when I broke the pen, I ordered the regular intuos2 pen due to it's being slightly cheaper on Wacom's site. Here, the platinum is 20 dollars more (and in my opinion, much uglier). I recommend buying the classic intuos2 pen."
2,does not work,Hand set came without visable damage however when the battery was placed inside all the phone did was blink. could not get a dial tone got an error message that stated the phone could not connect. I WOULED LIKE TO SEND IT BACK.
5,Perfectly adequate.,"Lightweight aluminum, polished sufficiently to look cool on a streetrod or hotrod. Internally, I had to polish some casting flash and threading edges. Will need sealant on the hose threads to prevent oil from seaping past the threads. Rubber o-ring seal from adapter to engine block."
5,Accurate and humorous-Worth buying,"Being trained in Internal Medicine, I've had many of the same conversations with my patients that are described here. However, I envy Dr. Clayton in his ability to approach the same topics with a witty sense of humor. Bravo to Clayton for keeping to the facts and not talking down to readers in this book. I'm buying multiple copies of this book for my friends, all young thirty-somethings in NYC burning both ends of the candle!"
1,Word 2003 Users BEWARE!,"There are big *UNRESOLVED* compatibility issues with Word 2003. The ""Cite While You Write"" feature doesn't work, which is a big deal. Don't be fooled by the endnote.com Web site--their seemingly easy fix doesn't work.Don't believe me? Do a quick Internet search on Endnote 7 and Word 2003 compatibility. Many have had problems."
4,Nice Statue but there are others,"I am a huge star wars fan and I realy enjoy collecting. this statue is a good representation of Darth Vader and I enjoy its detail. Its well designed and sturdy, but it lacks variety, I also found it to be difficult to snap together. For $100.00 or so there are other styles to chose from so check star wars shop or amazon before chosing an investment like this one or others."
5,PARTY TIME!,"I went to the Bahamas back in 1990 and saw Dry Bread right there at the Beach at Xanadu. He was playing in the little outdoor bar they got going and I must say, his music really set the mood to party! He was great and I bought 2 cassettes right there and to this day still listen to them and they bring me right back to the Bahamian sunset on that beautiful beach!"
5,informed and well written historical account of Jesus,"If you want a ""secular"" or historical viewpoint on Jesus, with as much cultural and religious baggage stripped away as possible, this is an excellent read. It has been a few years since I read this book, so I don't have a very useful review, but I saw this title while checking if Sheehan has any new titles out and wanted to throw in my ""five stars."""
2,"Right, Jesus of Nazareth is not God","Well, that would mean that an impressive list of remarkably articulate and apparently intelligent people: Origen; Augustine; Aquinas; Benedict; Ignatius;Newman;( the list could go on)were all quite unable to see through what Mr. Sheehan considers to be a deceptive presentation of Christ's message. Faith, to Mr. Sheehan, is an impediment to apprehending truth; as opposed to faith being a grace given to aid closer communion with God. Mr. Sheehan is a very proper Cartesian skeptic, his scholarship is heavy with reference. Thankfully, the Old and New Testament were not written so.The First Coming: How the Kingdom of God Became Christianity"
2,Quite disappointing,"The format of this novel is indeed innovative. However, the words the characters purportedly write in their journals, or tell to the story's journalist, are contrived and not credible. Also, some of the passages (such as the Sikh character's tale of the anti-Sikh pogroms in 1984 following the assassination of Indira Gandhi) seemed to be included not because they develop the story, but rather because the author thinks the reader ought to know the history in detail. Is this book trying to be a novel, or a William Dalrymple wanna be? It's like attending a presentation given by someone who is excited about his/her topic, but cannot seem to realize that what he/she knows and what the audience wants are quite different. We can absorb history as part of a novel without being hit over the head and lectured about it."
4,"""Love"" among the ruins",The writing style in this book allows for multiple points of view and in a lot of ways allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions about what really happened. Very cleverly written compelling story with a very complex cultural & historical backdrop. The characters while interesting and compelling are not exactly likable or really even sympathetic.
2,A Below Average Affair,"Having read so much about the book and its subject matter before reading, I must say I was disappointed with the book after I read it. Shashi Tharoor seems to want to please his audience and stick to tradition much like his character Lakshman by incorporating the nine-elements (love, hate, disgust, anger, laugh, ...) of story telling. The problem is he has spent too much time exploring love and not enough on the other elements. At times, Mr. Tharoor appeared eager to bringout all issues in India namely, women's rights, population and birth-control, separationism/terrorism and religious fervorism and seems to have lost focus. The book is written for international audience and serves the purpose of introducing multi-faceted India to a foreigner."
1,...,"Mr. Tharoor, like his earlier works only shows small flashes of creativity. Only that in this book, the flashes are smaller in size. The love story between the Indian govt. official and the American student appears rather unreal. There is no depth to any of the characterizations, and much of the stuff seems to pander to its intended audience. The anatomy of a riot has been briefly focussed on, and in that the author has done a reasonable job. But what the author fails in is that there is no real connection between the death of the researcher and the riot. A few casual attempts are made to link them up but that is not enough when the title of the book itself is 'Riot'"
1,"Interesting, but mediocre","Tharoor's compulsion to please the audience, give them the stereotypes that they are already used to, is the reason that he has not matured as a novelist or an essayist. Tharoor does not have the capacity -- yet -- to step out of the most crowded vantage point to obtain his own unique perspective. His is the novel of the PR man: middling but not memorable."
1,Furi knife has poor drsign,I bought a set of these knives for my wife. She used the large knife to slice a yam and the handle broke right off. the steel shank that goes into the cheep plastic handle measures about a quarter inch square and snapped under normal use. What a poor design! We use the remaining knives very gently for fear of breaking them also. The Limited Lifetime warrenty is totally worthless because there is no-one who you can go to to try to get a replacement or repair. I will never buy a Furi product again
2,not happy,my husband gave this to me for christmas. The knives that he ordered were the sparkley ones. Instead they were all one color (orange). I love here stuff but they werent the the colors. (rachel ray stuff) everything else he ordered was the right color.
4,"good, but not the same magic as ""The Snowman""","My children 4 and 5/1/2 loved the Raymond Briggs' movie ""The Snowman"" so much that I bought this one without viewing it first. Although the story is sweet, the music is not as good. I always turn down the ""singing"" when the bear constilation (Ursa Major) appears. Instead of being beautiful and adding to the story, to us it just sounds grating. The part I love the best is when the girl and family watch ""the Snowman"" on T.V. it shows to me how much better that sound track was. Still, a good movie, and one we watch often."
5,"the previous reviews are for the wrong movie,","This movie ""THE BEAR"" is an animated one based on the childrens book by Raymond Briggs. It has music and no words and is wonderful. Briggs has another similar movie called ""THE SNOWMAN"" These other reviews are for the other movie with the same title which appears to be about a real bear."
3,Disney changed it for the worse.,"The Bear originally did (as stated in the Amazon editorial review information) ""embrace a lost art: the wordless narrative."" That is what you get when purchasing the VHS version of this wonderful short film. However, when Buena Vista Home Video (Disney) got a hold of it for the DVD they added narration and sound effects. The film suffers for these changes. I own the VHS version and have enjoyed it as an adult and with my children. I was excited to learn of a DVD version and ordered it as soon as it was available. However, I am disappointed in these changes and encourage you to purchase the VHS over the DVD.As for The Animal Train it is pleasant enough and my 3 year old, who loves trains, has watched it repeatedly. But, it is not in the same class as The Bear (the original VHS version)."
5,"A lyrical, magical story","I showed this to a class of kindergarteners and they all sat quietly for the 30 minutes to watch...an amazing feat! The art is beautiful and the story sweet. Don't miss it, whether you have kids or not."
3,"Bad mistake of adding narrator to ""Bear""",".... I and my 2 1/2-old boy have enjoyed watching ""Bear"" so much in the past so I was excited to get the DVD version. However, to my disappointment, it has added narration - the VHS version did not have narration. What the narrator does is to completely take away imaginabiltiy and mind-creativity of kids who watch it over and over with different interpretation of the story each time. I would have given it only one star, but ""Animal Train"" was very good so I am giving the DVD three star rating. (By the way, there is nothing against the narrator, Judy Dench who happens to be one of my and my wife's favorite actors)"
2,"Narration is Terrible, Ruined a Good Thing","When we first watched this as VHS with my daughter (several years ago) it was wonderful! The images and music combined to tell the story and also let her figure out what was happening on her own, using her imagination. In this version, the narration tells the story for you, so kids don't have to think, but not only that - it ruins the soundtrack and is very distracting. At some points it's hard to hear, so it sounds like someone talking just loudly enough to be disturbing. The vocals, so lovely during the skating scene, are now shortened and relegated to the background, barely audible, and the narration continues as someone talking over the music. I wish it had been left alone with just the images and the music as it was first made. It was much better then. If I could return this one, I would. Very disappointing!"
4,Great replacement horns,These horns replaced te usual factory horns on my F250 King Ranch...wow...they are loud and proud just like I wanted. Outside of the install hassles...location etc...they are great.
5,Best Iced Tea,"I first tasted this tea at PF Chang's. They showed me the box they used and I had ordered several times. Unfortunately I haven't been able to locate the company since they closed their web site, was surprised and pleased to find it on Amazon."
3,"Fiesta Fria tastes great, packaging sucks!","The product itself is tastes great, but I was extremely disappointed when a little box showed up and ""brown stuff"" was falling out of it! As I was opening the box lots of ""dirt"" like material kept falling out of the box and was getting everywhere. Inside the box all of the plastic bags of loose tea where just crammed in there and where leaking the loose tea leaves all over the place. I can only imagine all of the tea that spilled out as it was shipped before it finally arrived at my house."
5,Just like PF Chang,I was first introduced to this Ice Tea at P.F. Chang's. All I can say is FANTASTIC and REFRESHING.
3,"The tea is ok, but...","I made this purchase because my father and my husband love this tea when we go to PF Chang's. I thought it would make a nice father's day gift. The tea itself is ok, but it's packaged in plastic bags, not tea bags. After making it, you have to filter the whole thing. It's a bit of a hassle."
4,He doesn't look like James Franciscus,"Hi. I am a huge fan of Planet of the Apes. I started collecting the Sideshow figures with the Taylor/Nova double pack. I liked them, so I ordered Cornelius, Zira, Zaius and Ursus. So I wanted one more, and saw Brent. I have taylor in his loin cloth, I though Brent in the astronaut suit would look nice. He doesn't look bad, but where the other figures closely resemble the actors/characters they played, this one looks like a crazed maniac. He does not look at all like James Franciscus. If that is not a problem for you, then get it. It is Sideshow, it is Planet of the Apes, and it is a human. He comes with a shovel (used to bury his commanding officer), oxygen tank, dog tags and water bottle. They all come with neat accessories. Problem is they are so small, they are easily lost, so be careful. He is the lowest priced of all the figures, so in that regard, he is worth it. So, keep collecting and have fun."
3,unpleasant,"I only read the first 38 pages of this book, which is why I'm giving it three stars rather than two; maybe it gets better. For me, this book is just too unpleasant. While Raymond Chandler liked to portray a seamy underworld full of lies and deceit, Philip Marlowe was a good guy who was never completely jaded, someone who still felt compassion and still believed in honor. But Henderson's protagonist just seems like someone who hates the world. I have a friend who has to take medication to avoid psychosis, and if she misses a pill she says she feels as though the entire world and everything in it is rotting. Henderson seems to see the world the same way, and I find that no more enjoyable than my friend does. But the book is competently written and I was slightly curious as to how it would turn out, so if you don't mind the unpleasantness you might enjoy this."
3,"Refreshing writing style, interesting story","How many times can you tell the age old ""femme fatale uses everyone to get her way"" story? One more time, apparently!I purchased this book because of a short story that I read in a compilation called ""100 Dastardly Little Detective Stories"". In that compilation I was impressed with Henderson straight ahead and rough style in what turned out to be Chapter 1 of ""No Free Lunch"".Well, it turned out that straight ahead style is good, but not good enough to make the book a page turner.I forced my way through this book, but would consider other Henderson works just to see if I had a knee jerk reaction to this book."
1,Wrong Movie,"I got the product when i was told i would get it, but when opened it was the wrong movie. I paid almost 50 dollars for one DVD and I get the wrong one. I hope its easy to return it."
1,Don's waste your money,"I bought this and tried to use it for about a month. It is not intutitive, is difficult to use, has no useful printed instructions...in short it is a piece of junk. I wasted my money"
3,BEWARE IF NOT AVID COMPUTER USER,"THIS IS SO DIIFICULT TO FIGURE OUT THAT I HAD TO BUY A BOOK TO TEACH ME HOW TO USE IT. I AM A MOTHER OF 2 SMALL CHILDREN AND TAKE ALOT OF DIGITAL PHOTOS, BUT I DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO SIT IN FRONT OF MY COMPUTER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM. DEFINETLY NOT USER FRIENDLY. PROBABLY MORE GEARED TO PROFESSIONAL DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHERS."
5,Excellent reliability and lots of functions,"Photoshop Elements(PHE) and Premier Elements (PRE) reliability is great. I've used 2 other DVD software packages and they had bugs and I was spending too much time trying to get them to work correctly, so since I wanted to upgrade Photoshop Elements from 2.0 to 3.0 I decided to try this software bundle and I am very happy and my family is also.Since DVD capturing/converting/burning takes time, it's very important to me to have quality reliable software. I have not tried all of the more advanced functions of PRE. PRE even automatically adjusts the video to make it fit on the DVD which is a nice feature that my other 2 DVD products did not have before.A introductory tutorial DVD demo for PHE and PRE comes with the package as well which is nice."
4,Worth the investment if you're a hobbyist,"The photo software ""Elements"" is a good package, and I will continue to use it, especially because of the Album organization feature and the touch up capability. It took some time to get to know it, and I still keep forgetting to manage my files inside of it, rather than through Microsoft. Luckily, it has a feature that ""reconnects"" to your photos if you move them around outside of the program. The video software ""Premiere Elements"" is also good, but I find myself using MS Movie Maker more often, so if that program comes with your PC you may not want to buy the combined set from Adobe. I can't figure out how to make smaller output (DVDs, VCDs, slide shows) on Adobe Premiere Elements, whereas on the MS Movie Maker the file sizes default to something much more manageable. So gotta go figure it out on Adobe, and that's a drag... All of this software works great on my new HP dv1000 notebook, a truly innovative machine and an amazing bargain."
3,Less confusing,This product is a little less confusing than Adobe photo shop suite. You will need to for any real photo editing.
2,Not Advanced Enough for Camcorders Out There,"The program is not set up to work with your newer camcorders, especially those camcorders with DVD capibilities."
4,Adobe Premier Elements,"A very fine product, but extremely hard to learn to use. Nothing is untuitive. Very user unfriendly. Software is predominately for video editing and production, and I only use it for producing slideshows from digital stills. Tutorials and ""Help"" contain very limited assistance for creating still digital DVDs. Highly recommend buying Adobe Classroom in a Book for Premier Elements at the same time software is ordered.Although creating my first DVD slide show was like ""the cat eating the grindstone"", the final results were worth the trouble. I would buy the software again."
5,cheap deal,"even with high shipping charge this was still a good buy. The reason for the discount was the ink was a few years old, however, it worked fine without any problem. I would buy again."
2,Informative but not key information concerning dosages.,This book does not include recommended dosage ranges for drugs. Thanks.
5,Entertaining and educational,"We always buy books as souvenirs from our vacations, and this is one of our favorites. Kids can relate to the little mouse hiding in Orville Wright's pocket on the first flight. They love how he figures out how to steal the cheese without getting caught in the brothers' traps. But it also gives kids a real feeling of how exciting it must have been to be there for the first flight! Plus it's a good introduction of what a reporter does to cover a good story. A very sweet book!"
1,Worked great but died suddenly,"The battery worked great for the first few months, but suddenly our camera died. We swapped in the original battery and went home to try to charge this battery and nothing happened. The charger would act like there was no battery in it, but worked fine with the OEM battery. Am checking on the warranty, but so far, I guess I get what I paid for when I bought a $7 battery."
5,A Must See For All Doctor Who Fans,"The War Games is an excellent episode and displays Patrick Troughton at his best. In watching this epic, I really feel that it's a shame most of Troughtons episodes are gone, but this episode has a great story and significant background about the Time Lords, the Doctors people."
3,War Games is a great film,"This film, in black and white, has the viewer spellbound until the ending credits. Made for a special audience, this movie creates the atmosphere you love in a movie. Having won tons of awards, the depiction of the chosen subject matter reaches not only the intended audience, but the mass population. This is a special order movie mainly because the general population chose to ignore it when it came out. Now the movie is hard to find, but I urge you, get this one. You won't be disappointed."
1,This review is for the DVD Packaging and the people at the BBC that did it.,"First - The War Games is a great serial. As good as or better than many Dr. Who episodes. However, the programmers of this DVD have ticked me off. Like many DVDs, they impose promotional information on you when the DVD launches. However, they also have messed up the programming on the transitions so that if you attempt to skip the chapter with John Oliver doing a tedious promotional pitch of BCC DVD to American audiences, the DVD player locks to the extent that it was necessary to unplug the DVD player to regain control. This is such a WONDERFUL feature. I paid $40+ for this privilege. I expect better of BBC. If you're going to force the viewing of the promotions, don't enable a pathway to locking up the DVD player."
5,Recommended to the attention of concerned parents,"A critically important addition for school and community libraries, as well as recommended to the attention of concerned parents wanting something to use with their children, Use Your Words: A Child's Struggle To Understand The Concept Of War is a children's picturebook by Robyn Rogers which was written especially to explain the problems of war to young readers, especially in a society where dissention through reason, talk, and freedom of expression is meant to be valued over physical conflict. Illustrated throughout by American school children, Use Your Words does its best to clearly present the all too real and imperfect facets of our world in a form young minds can readily grasp."
5,Everybody Should take time to see this show,This is probly one of the funniest show ive seen and everybody should take some time to watch it.Ive been watching it from the begining and im from Victoriaville so i cant wait for season 5.
5,Our Great Canadians,"The Trailer Park boys have become major celebrities for a vast majority of Canadians. Their focus on comedy within a certain spectrum of social behaviour is absolutly hilarious! It is so well done that persons that resemble these characters whether it be their housing or personal, can associate and giggle at these boys' various antics! Even persons who don't consider themselves ""trailer park"" people, find something that can be identified with and giggle!Bubbles has stealed the show with his well-scripted lines and knee-slapping ideas and well of course, let's not forget about Julien the ""PIN UP BOY FOR THE PARK!""Ricky and his continuous explosive behaviour, reminds all those that watch about that ""street bully"" that never seemed to have his head on straight!Add the rest of the cast for flavour and you've got a full fledged hit on your hands.Before they become too big, get out and buy them and be like the rest of us to experience their magic through humour and realism!"
5,Just a funny as Season 1 & 2!!!,"Wow, what can I say...LOVE this season too!!! You know how sometimes, a show starts out strong and then gradually loses steam? Not the case here!!! LMFAO funny in Season 3! I cannot get enough of this show...It's addicting, like the ""dope"" Ricky grows! LOL!!! I cannot stress it enough: If you have NEVER seen any Trailer Park Boys anything...START WITH THE TV SERIES!!! Just try it, you will come over to the dark side! Lots of foul language, but in a feel-good kinda way...."
5,Great Canadian Comedy,"Trailer Park Boys is unmatchable. The characters Ricky, Julian, & Bubbles are very well developed. Ricky is a great guy, but is just confused at times. In his confusion, he just happens to bring him and everyone around him down. Julian, usually the problem solver, like many people is always frustrated by Ricky's actions. Bubbles, the COOLEST character, fixes shopping carts for a living.If you haven't seen season 1 & 2, then get them first."
5,Funniest thing on TV,"Hey I am just doing this review while hunting for Season 5 - once you see the show - you'll be jonesing for more too! Original, just too funny, this TV show rocks out. Although this is truly a Eastern Canadian show, those of us who grew up in 1970s can deeply relate to it. I see it more as a Gen X/Y style humor for all nations."
4,Bangin!!!!,"This group really showed up on this album...The lyrics are off the charts. Well written, well preformed, and brought to life through beats that not even mainstream rappers & producers can mess with!!!!! Russel simmons eat your heart out!!!!!!"
3,Pleasant view of a famous musical family,"""The Strauss family"" made for TV miniseries is an interesting view of this multi-talented family. However, it shows how a dramatist can use factual material and twist it for the good of telling a story. If one knows much about this illustrious family, one knows that much is left out and much is fabricated to make an entertaining afternoon. I recommend it to those who know nothing about the family. Actually one could make a wonderful series out of the experiences of these musicians, but it would take many hours to do so. It is disappointing that this movie makes such little use of the many beautiful compositions from the several Strauss men."
2,Strauss Family,I was somewhat disappointed because I thought this was the original showing of the Strauss family mini-series with the development of the waltz and other family stories.
4,The Strauss Family,I am very pleased with this item. It arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition.
1,rating the seller not the item,"I ordered this movie last year. I remember watching it on TV and was really looking forward to it arriving. It never did, and numerous e-mails to both the seller and Amazon yeilded no results."
3,"great mirror, inflated price!","Wow!! I guess this must be what they mean by inflation! I bought this mirror for 39.99 at Big Lots about 4 years ago. It recently tipped over and the glass got broken, so I was looking to replace it, but now see that the price has inexplicably doubled!!I must admit that I don't think it's worth the price they're asking here. The design of the mirror is very attractive. (I have the matching bed frame), but the metal poles are hollow, not very strong or substantial, and the piece is extremely light and fragile for it's size--hence how it got knocked over so easily.Since only the glass was broken and the frame is still intact,it will probably end up being cheaper for me to replace the glass than it would be to order another at this price."
1,"Very amateur, not worth 4 dollars!","I'm as liberal as they come, but this is simply not a good production.The low point for me was the cheap shot of juxtaposing hardships of elderly on social security with the Koch wealth frame by frame. My intelligence felt a bit insulted there.This movie treats it's viewers with the same distrust of intelligence as fox news treat theirs.Also, can you really hard-sell the ""exposed"" point if every bit of information you provide is already publically available?"
1,What a waste of money,"I don't believe anyone could think that this video is anything more than a smeare campaign against the Koch brothers written, directed, and starring a group of radical communists who would like nothing more than the destruction of the United States of America. I mean seriously does anyone really want to accept the words of Van Jones. He is a know communist whom Obama snuck out of the White House as soon as the American public realized how radical he was.On a side note, I don't understand the thinking of these communists. Throughout history the only thing that communism created has been misery and strife. Communism leads to an elite ruling class and a whole lot of peasants who get murdered by the dumptruck load by their rulers; i.e. Stalin, Lenin, Mai, etc. God bless the United States of America, and God bless the Koch brothers for all the great things they do.I'd give this rubbish a 0 star, but Amazon won't ley me."
1,Hit Piece,"I went into this movie with an open mind. However, it became readily obvious that the Koch brothers are just business men who exercise their american right to support certain candidates and beliefs. The true influence peddlers here are Bernie Sanders and Van Jones. These men are exceedingly wealthy. Their Tides Foundation helped write the stimulus bill. Some of that money went to their friends and indirectly their bank accounts! These men are not just part of the one percent, but they got there by stealing from others.The Koch brothers are decent men who inspire me to work hard."
3,Disappointing,"Yes, the Kock ... I mean Koch ... brothers are evil bastards. Nothing really new here. The director/producer's way of stitching it all together with silly soundtrack and graphics made it seem a little cartoonish. They should redo it with Bullwinkle narrating and Boris Badinov and Natasha making a cameo appearance here and there. Did I mention that the Kock ... I mean Koch ... brothers are evil bastards?"
2,Not as good as some other financial documentaries that I've seen,"the pacing was way too fast. This movie could have easily been an hour and twenty minutes if the pacing wasn't so ridiculously fast. Also, it utilized text on the screen (during the movie) that was very amateurish, straight out of 1980's Pac Man! Park Avenue covers the same stuff, but doesn't focus exclusively on the Koch Brothers. Check out that movie, or The Flaw is also better."
3,Consider it a donation!,"The video was not all that I expected it to be. I thought there would be more to it; it was short and not as revealing as I had hoped. Most of the information was background and just as I thought the video was getting into new stuff, it ended. I looked at the cost as a mere donation to the cause of exposing the Koch Brothers to those who know zero about them."
2,is this the best cleaver?,"I made a big decision to invest this expensive cleaver, but very dispointed after first use. It is not sharp, it is difficult to cut through meat and bones. Maybe it is the cleaver for professionals because they know how to sharpen and hone it on daily basis."
4,Perfect Size... Works for Me!,Well i've had this brush about 2 months now... I have thick hair and this brush helps blow it out to a shiny finish so i'm quite pleased with this purchase.
1,Poor Quality and No Customer Support,"Do not buy PanDigital. They do not support the product. Mine quit working (flash!) after less than 4 months. ""Customer Service"" told me ""unfortunately...."" after the 90 day warranty they would do nothing. Don't believe the manual or their website. They do not repair this product...There are NO parts, you are just SOL. Stay away!!"
2,USB Problem,I have the same problem using the cable that came with my pandigital frame. I used my Canon USB cable and seem to recognize the internal drives that way. Still was hit and miss as seem to be slow and had to turn the frame off and on a few times but was able to drag and drop this way. Hope this helps someone if you have a different USB cable to try!
1,Terrible resolution!,"I saw a display model at the store, but I was surprised upon turning it on, that the demo one had a higher resolution than the one I had bought.If you are going to buy a digital photo frame, do not settle for anything lower than 800x600 (or 480, if you're into widescreen) This frame seemed to be less than half of that resolution, and all the pictures came out terribly pixelized. Definitely not worth the money-if you put in a few more bucks, you can pick up ones with much higher quality. I am returning mine as soon as I can for a new one.+Easy plug and play-Limited menu functions. My older, smaller frame had more options with easier navigation.-Low screen brightness (Low adjustment sensitivity as well). Very hard to see the pictures in low to adequate lighting in a room.-Narrow viewing angle- you pretty much have to be in a very specific position in order to see the photos.-Screen off-center from frame (.5cm too high)-Low resolution-Choppy photo transitions-The list goes on."
2,"Loved it for a long time, but then","I really enjoyed this product for the last year, even though the resolution was a bit lower than I would have wanted. However, it has recently started locking up when in picture slideshow, which is the main feature I use. Without this feature, I don't have much for this photo frame.Now I'm stuck trying to figure out if it has a warranty or not.Alas.The music function is basically useless. It might be better if you could play the music at the same time as the slideshow, but this is not possible. When I did play a song alone, it sounded horrible. It's not a radio, it's a picture frame!Haven't tried the video function, because once again, you can't combine pictures and videos, you have to play them separately.I'm giving it two stars because I did get one year's use out of it."
4,He loves it.,"I bought this for my husband, for Christmas and he loves it. Yes, the picture quality is not great compared to a computer monitor, but as a novelty it's great for the price! If you want superb picture quality, spring for the Philips brand. You can probably find a good deal right now after Christmas. But since prices on these things will probably go down substantially by next year, I saw no reason to spend a fortune now since this is a relatively new product. He brags on this thing to everyone he's talked to since Christmas morning. He says it does make him a little homesick though, when he's at the office seeing all those family pics.I had no problem at all loading it with photos. I just used its own internal drive, though I'll probably load up a card with more storage later. Most of my photos are optimized for the internet anyway, so I got a huge number of pics on it."
1,"ZERO STARS, STAY AWAY","I wish there was a space for zero stars. We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died. It was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing. Once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently. Do some research and buy another unit; that's what I'm going to do."
2,Subpar Quality,"This is the first digital frame I bought. I know the resolution won't be anywhere close to a computer LCD monitor, but I was still very disappointed when I turned on the frame. The LCD screen is strangely long and narrow (resolution 1440x234), so a normal photo only occupies a small part of the screen, making this product effectively a 4"" frame with a lot of black space on both sides. The resolution of the photos is very bad, and photos look a little distorted as well.Pros:1) Plug and Play, easy to set up.2) Exchangeable frames included.Cons:1) Very poor resolution.2) Strange LCD shape. Advertised as a 7"", but effectively a 4-5"" frame with a lot of unused LCD pixels.I returned this product and bought a Westinghouse DPF0561 5.6"" Frame instead. I like the Westinghouse a lot more. It is even easier to set up, photos look good and actually larger than on the Pandigital 7"" frame, and viewing angle is great."
1,Bad resolution,We loaded up some photos and they looked blocky and bad. Immediately returned them. These were photos taken on a Digital Rebel and look great on the computer and in print.
1,This is a waste of 90 dollars,"At first when I received this product for Christmas, I was very excited because I have a lot of digital photos that would be nice to display. However there were a couple major problems with this picture frame:1. The display was quite poor, but I guess that's what you get for $1002. The video and sound was pretty much useless.3. The reliability is very poor. After 3 weeks the frame started making a squeeling noise. We sent it back and then received another one that didn't even turn on. I sent that one back for a refundIt appears that there are better digital picture frames for just a little more money out there so I would pass on this one even though it isn't very expensive."
3,You get what you pay for - OK,"I got mine from Fry's. It is the newer model with 128mb. There was some lagging in speed because the images were too high of a resolution. The quick fix is to use the WindowsXP powertool call ImageResizer. Free to download. Shrunk my 5.0mp images from about 1.7mb in size down to about 30k (at the 800x600 setting). Images now slideshow much faster and with a left over 512mb SD I had laying around, I could easily put thousands of images on it. Could not get the videos to work though, would be nice but no biggie. On the images where the pictures are bright and sunny, it looks great, but darking indoor images, the contrast is not so great. From 6 feet away, it is very watchable, up close at 2 to 3 feet, you can see the pixels."
1,Nice.. While it worked.,"This frame was a great solution for my desk at work. I was able to show off more than 100 photos... for about 3 months. A couple of weeks after the 90 day warranty ended, the screen went blank and it won't come back on. I wrote to Pandigital, and not surprisingly, they haven't written back.For $100, I would have expected it to last at least a year or two."
2,good picture bad software,"If you want to load directly from your camera's memory card the system takes forever to copy photos to the internal card. There is no ""copy all"" function.Loading information from a computer didn't work. The USB connection was not recognized by Windows XP and I couldn't find any drivers on the Web.A setup CD would be a nice addition.BTW the screen was not as large as one might think. It is very wide but not tall and it crops the top & bottom of most pictures making it great for shots of the grand canyon but not for portraits of people."
2,Fixed the USB problem,"My wife got one of these for Christmas, and it's not awful. My main complaint is with the USB connection.The resolution isn't outstanding, but what do you expect for this price? The choppiness other reviewers mentioned is just an artifact of the low resolution.My computer didn't recognize the USB connection - very frustrating. Their customer support number automatically hing up on me each time I called.*** I found, however, that if I hooked the frame into an external hub then hooked the hub into my computer, it worked just fine. ***I wouldn't recommend buying this product due to the poor support and defective USB, but if like me you're stuck with it, use the above fix."
1,Didn't work!!!,"I purchased this, plugged it in and it worked for about 5 minutes. Tried to call Pandigital (aka Sony) as never got connected to the right person. Looked on line for support. I called the number, and it was nonoperational! I took it back. VERY DISSAPOINTED and without a Christmas present for my parents!"
1,pandigital photo frames --- money wasted,"I purchased a pandigital 8"" photo frame for my husband for Christmas. It lasted about three weeks before the screen went blank and it no longer worked. The manufacturer did not stand by the warranty which is only 90 days to begin with. Even though it broke within 30 days of use and 45 days of purchase they would not replace the frame. We wrote to the president of the company and did get a phone call but still no assistance. They promised to ""think about"" replacing it after I said I would share this bad report but they never took action. Do not waste your money on a frame that has no company behind it! Big money down the drain!"
1,No customer service,"Pandigital 5.6-Inch LCD Digital Picture FrameI recieved this frame for Christmas.It abruptly stopped working. There is a website but obviously no one ever checks the e-mail.I have sent them 3 e-mails without a response.I called the 1-800 customer service line and was put on hold for more than 20 minutes (my limit) and hung up. DO NOT buy this product ,there is alot better frames out there with good service if needed."
1,Terrible quality all around,"I got this as a birthday present. I've been wanting a digital photo frame for a while, so I was really hoping for the best. But the quality of this product all around is poor. There's a giant ferrite bead at the end of the power cable that hangs just below the frame, so hanging the frame on the wall would be ugly. Copying photos to the device was painfully slow. The controls for the device were confusing and went from ultra responsive one second to non responsive the next. The pixels were blurry and big enough to count by hand. The users manual didn't give any indication on what the resolution was, so I could at least get the pictures into a close enough size to get better quality out of them. The aspect ratio made tall pictures display almost postage stamp size. And when I tried deleting photos through the device interface, it froze several times. I'm going to be returning it right away."
2,cut off heads!,"the price was great on this frame, and the image was okay, for a cheaper model, and it ran smoothly - but the huge problem was that it cut off about a third of the pictures. at first i thought we could live with it, but there were just too many headless people - often the whole focal point of the picture was cut off. so had to take it back. also the power cord that came with it didn't work and had to use my own power cord from my own digital frame just to get it to turn on at all. (this was to be a gift). learned that i have to make sure any frame i buy is closer to square than rectangle. widescreens may work for dvd viewing, but they don't make for good picture viewing!"
1,Don't buy this if you expect to download from your computer,"I bought this, my first digital frame, expecting to be able to download pictures from my laptop (an up-to-date Dell). The manual says ominously ""your computer my not recognize the device at first, just disconnect and keep trying."" After three hours and maybe 25-30 attempts, and re-reading the instructions, I gave up. I brought it back to Staples and got a refund; when I told them the problem, they said ""oh yeah, it doesn't work with any computer; everyone's returning these, get the kodak."""
2,Don't buy,"Cons:Would not read one of my conpact flash cards, but lucky for me I had more than one and the other flash card worked, my computer won't read the USB connection so I have to transfer photos to my flash card then insert the flash card into the picture frame, forget trying to copy files onto the internal memory it takes too long one picture at a time, the screen is an odd size and cuts the head off of some of the photos.Pros:The frames look nice.The only reason I purchased this one was because I waited too close to Chrismas and all the stores were sold out of the good ones."
3,Almost Perfect,"I plugged in my 1GB SD card with about 20 pictures and it worked great. The photos also look great. Perfect $100 gift for my mom.Problems:1. Video does not work. It looked like slow motion. Useless.2. I have a 2GB SD card with 15,000 photos on it. The frame only sees 2000 photos. It appears to be limited to 2000 photos.3. Web support does not exist.I can live without the video, but I wanted a frame that will play all my photos on my SD card."
4,Not as bad as I expected,"After reading the reviews here I was hesitent to even open the box after I unwrapped this present. Once I got it out of the box and all my photos onto the 512mb SD card I had the pictures were playing back beutifully for a while, then it just froze. I used irfanview (free software) to resize all my pics and it's been on and running in slideshow mode for dayas since with no problems. The resolution isn't fantastic but from anything more than a foot or two away pictures look perfect and with it sitting next to my other picture frames you really can't tell the difference between real photos and the ones displayed on screen in the digital frame. I am definitly happy with the product dispite a few flaws"
1,Pandigital Sucks,Don't buy anything from Pandigital. They won't support their products. Mine broke right out of the box and they refuse to take care it. Now I just got a post card from them saying that the envelope for my rebate was empty so they won't honor it. I've got a box sitting here with a big hole in it from where I cut out the UPC. These people are worse than insurance companies. What can I do. I don't have the UPC because it was sent and they say they got the envelope and the form but no receipt or UPC. What a bunch of crooks.
1,Find another company,"If anything goes wrong, dealing with Pandigital 'customer support' is like beating your head against a brick wall. Save yourself frustration and buy something from another brand."
1,Extremely difficult to use,"I am writing this review as i am struggling to modify the images on the Pandigital frame we got for my mother. I have been at it for 1.5 hours. this product is extremely difficult to use, and i do not think it received any QA testing whatsoever. For instance, while editing the images, it displays them in pages - 6 images per ""page"". If you delete an image on page 5 of 12, no matter what action you take next, you are either placed on page 1 or page 12 (or whatever the last page is). Respinse times are slow, the menus are horrible to navigate, and you cannot simultaneously see the screen AND the necessary buttons at the same time. This product should interface to the PC, and let the user use the PC to navigate the local storage. There must be better products out there - it shouldn't be that difficult."
3,Big Band agenda,"Good band, mediocre arrangements and a ""so so"" trumpet player heavy on the loud, brassy side, definitely not in the Harry James/Bunny Berigan class."
5,An explosion of magic to start the series!,Arena had tons of magic woven into the pages. The author casts an explosive spell on the pages with words. The story goes into the five houses of magic and tells superbly the tale of Garth One Eye.
4,ok,This book is about a fighter mage who is seeking revenge. It's written well. The text isn't perfect but it's ok. The thing that i liked about is the mention of magic. I'm a magic player with many of the cards that he writes about. This book is a good read but it isn't like WAR AND PEACE as others seem to have said it was.
5,garth,"Garth One-eye is one of the best characters ever, only one better is the immortal Lestat. Great story, for being the first in the series it is astoundingly well written. It grips you from the start and never lets you go. I still want more from the story of Garth One-eye."
5,Arena,"What can I say, I read it once, I read it twice and I still love it. It held me captivated in the way the main character was able to play all the houses against each other in order to win himself. And I was amazed at how he was able to beat the ""all-powerful"" planeswalker at the end of the tournament. This is a book I would advise to any one who loves to read of magic and magic battles."
5,Damn what a good book.,"This is definetly one of the best books i have ever read. Although i dont play M:tG anymore, i first read it when i was seriously obsessed with the game. i forgot about it for a few years, and picked it up about 4 hours ago. Now that im older and have more of a sence for good literature ,I am very impressed with this book and reccomend it to anyone who is partial to the fantasy genre. The plot development and twists and they way the charecters are developed in a way where you learn to either love or hate them with a passion is masterfull. This is a great book and will be enjoyed by anyone, magic player or not, girl or guy, whatever. read this book, it's excelent!"
3,"Best in the series so far, but far from perfect","Reading all of the reviews so far for this book you'd think it was the greatest fantasy ever written. Well, I'm here to tell the truth . . . It's a good read, but could have been better. I found elements of the plot shallow, and often only a semi-tangible relationship the game. A problem which gets worse as the series goes on. I am a serious magic player, and therefore am very critical of a work such as this. In closing though, for the price of a paperback, it's worth the read . . . just don't expect greatness."
3,Arena,"I know this book is far from awesome, however, I still enjoy reading it. I get such a kick out of when a spell is cast, and I know what card they are referring to. I really think that the MtG novels got the short end of the stick, when thinking about how people view them. They are entertaining. And for me, the wife of a (former) avid Magic player, they offered me a way to be involved in the game, as I did not play that often, insight into the characters and places that were being battled over on the table top."
3,A commendable effort of heavy Afro house,"Not quite the club track collection advertised, Nu Afro Latin bases it's roots as much in the sampledelica and drum machine style of early hip hop as their proclaimed Latin and African flavors. As can happen, the spicy percussion and instrumental flare (flutes, sax and such on ""Allen Fresh"" wah-guitar of ""Your Mum"") are a treat, but the chanting and whooping it up can be a bit much.Treats include Fila Brazilla turning in a joyous mix of ""Royal Rumba"" and Fazed Idjuts (a Faze Action/Idjut Boys collaboration) delivering a fine eleven minute drum excursion. And you could say Masters at Work know a thing or two about tunes.Bottom line: a commendable effort for those seeking a strong African vibe with a house beat."
1,Insatisfied,I don't Believe that this product are from Christina Aguilera the bottle isn't the same as the site of Christina
5,Can't believe I missed this 1 ...,"This is an excellent movie that requires reading between the lines to figure out the truth.I loved the objective which was to survive in space.Adapt or die ...PROsgreat sci-fiCGIcreaturessetsdramamade great use of existing conflicts to set the backdrop for what might happen to the human raceCONshokey ending which will lead to part 2I'm still watching the special features.They were pretty good.PS I want one of those laser razors, no stubble."
4,DeadSPACE!,This movie is such a wonderful product and great entertainment for those wanting to get scared and enjoy a great film.
4,Pandorum,"To say that it immitates other movies would be inaccurate. Does it have some of the feel ofEvent Horizon (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)andAlien: 20th Anniversary Edition [Award Series]? Perhaps a little of their ambiance, but it is a unique movie unto itself. Imagine a couple of crewman on a an extremely large spacecraft waking and finding they don't recall much of their mission, the date, or their destination. As they start to recall the reactor on the ship is going critical and they must reset it. There is only one problem, they aren't alone and in addition to psychotic crew aboard there are creatures that like the taste of human flesh. If you enjoy SciFi movies that are tense, dark, and scary you may want to check this one out because the crew is going to fight for their lifes to survive. If you enjoy this catchSphere (Snap Case).CA Luster"
3,"A Lot of Horror, A Little Sci-Fi","My impression as I watched the movie was that I was watching a horror flick, not a sci-fi movie. True there are some sci-fi references scattered throughout and at the beginning and the end but this is mostly a horror flick.I was pleasantly surprised by the ending which was very clever and came away thinking, with some of the Hollywood sensationalism removed, it could have made a pretty good sci-fi short story.If you're a horror fan, then this movie may please you. I had some problems understanding all of the dialog as the recording level of the voices varied a great deal. The bulk of the movie is in darkened locations that could have been anywhere which is always best for horror it seems.I gave it three stars as it did generate enough interest on my part to wonder where it was going and how things would turn out.My suggestion is to rent it first and measure the appeal, if you love it buy the disc."
5,best since aliens,this is the best sci fi horror movie since aliens in my opinion. watch at night for a better experience.
2,"Good sets, acting and basic plot but no cigar","Good sets, acting and basic plot but no cigar for the slow plodding suspense and cheesy mutants. And, yes it is partially an ""Aliens"" clone, and starts looking like a few other quasi-cyber martial arts hybrids and modern TV SF (science fiction) drama. So not bad to fast-forward through thoug, the sets and the space special effects were first rate. Pandorum would have made a good SF short story. This movie was way too repetitive and predictable to be taken seriously, except for ending, which I did like, in more ways than one."
3,Mishmash Of What You've Seen Before,"If you've seen Sphere, I Am Legend, The Matrix, Moon, or any combination of the rest, then you've seen Pandorum.But Pandorum has some entertaining (and thrilling) aspects, and the temptation of a young spaceman is certainly thought-provoking. The special effects are above average, the acting is point on (given the script which is a bit convoluted at times,) and overall, it was worth a watch."
2,ho-hum dorum,"big deal...everyone discovers that they've been ""there"" all along and wind up bobbing up like spent corks into the ""promised land!!"" don't waste your time. best to select the blob with steve mcqueen...strawberry jam turns mankiller!!"
3,Just an okay movie,This movie presented nothing special except that kickboxer Cung Le starred in it. The look of the bad guys was decent. There were some nice kills. I say 3 stars is right on the money. Not worth buying but i don't regret watching it.
2,Don't Board This Ship..,"Dis you like Alien? Did you like Event Horizon? Then you won't like Pandorum. This movie is a classic example of a good idea poorly executed. The story: a guy wakes up on a deep space ship heading to colonize an alien world. He finds out that the ship is in trouble: it is off course and there are alien monsters running around snacking on the crew and passengers (oh dear!!). What to do..Waht to do..What..to..do..If you don't figure out the entire movie 30 minutes into Pandorum, then you were'nt paying attention. That's the problem, no real surprises. Plus the whole ""why don't they call back home"" idea is handled by destroying the Earth. How? That was never really explained (BOOM - it blew up, move on..)This movie is not bad, its just not interesting. A better script would have helped; this is another version of the Posieden Adventure. The monsters seem to be thrown in as an after thought.Skip it."
3,ENTER The DOPPLEGANGER,"For those viewers that Know what a doppleganger Is, dont be disheartened,, the movie Is watchable. But Un-like the recent animated blockbuster(Dead Space)that made it to a game, this real actor/fantasy movie will probably not become a XBox game. In My Opinion this movie follows the animated flik to close, Until the ending.But again, it Is watchable."
2,"A Convoluted, Derivative Mess",There are numerous films that did poor box office but deserved to be seen. This isn't one of them. I guess the number of positive reviews reflect movie goers' need for mindless action rather than well-developed characters or logical plots. The set and mood of the piece are spot-on -- dismal and claustrophobic -- but other than a handful of people running from monsters not much happens. Too bad more attention wasn't given to the script. This could have been a thought-provoking and insightful cautionary tale.
1,movie didn't play!!! Only previews played,"I won't ever buy movies from you again, this movie didn't even play, all it played was previews of other movies, and I don't have time to return back to you. It was only $10. but that isn't the point. Never again"
4,Weird but fascinating,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I popped this DVD in to watch it. Sure, it was sci-fi and I had read the back of the DVD case to see what it was about, but this was a very unique movie. In today's age where so many movies seem the same because they feel so unoriginal, this was actually a breath of fresh air.I can't say that the idea itself was entirely original as I have seen bits of such an idea in books or other movies (waking up from a long sleep, dealing with monsters on a ship, being lost in space, whatever), but the delivery was very, very good. It keeps you on the edge of your seat because you're trying to figure out what is going on (along with the characters themselves in the film as they come to terms with their memory loss from hyper-sleep) as bits and pieces of the whole puzzle/picture are revealed - and it's actually a rather shocking revelation (but I shan't spoil it for you!) If you're into sci-fi and futuristic plots, then you should enjoy this movie."
4,A pleasant surprise,"You already own the box set of the Alien Quadrilogy, and love any movie that deals with weird things happening in outer space. Event Horizon, Sunshine, Supernova, Solaris, 2001 A space oddessey. This movie belongs in the group. The acting is great, and although some of the plot is not surprising, other twists are. Don't pass this one up."
4,A different Movie,The is a different kind of scary space movie and the creatures are a little freaky I would rate this above average or a good rental movie
3,A So-So Sci-fi,"I found this film to be somewhat too slow paced and confusing. Don't get be wrong I followed the storyline and plot points pretty well, but some obscure references about Quaids wife and some other points, such as why there was a guy who only spoke Vietnamese on the ship, just kind of passed me by. Being a person who likes Dennis Quaid I was dissappointed that his scenes were a bit few and far between. The nasties were a bit ridiculous and perhaps the storyline with the main characters could have been more solidified and expanded. I also found the film to be weighted more to the horror genre than the science fiction. I would have preferred it the other way round myself. All in all it was a reasonably well shot film with several twists and turns if not a little lacking in storyline. I would suggestEvent Horizon [Blu-ray]for a better lost spaceship film."
