4,"It works! But, my daughter found it a tad boring.","We live in the world of bright colored books with gimmicks. It's sometimes hard for little ones to get into a book that focus's on actually teaching something.First off, this book worked for us. We only modified the directions slightly. And, each lesson is short.My daughter was bored with some of the stories. They were a bit absurd,especially early on. Past lesson 50, the book really shines.The book starts by introducing a sound- A, R, M. Each sound is practiced until they have a good grasp of it. It progresses from letters to blends, and beyond. It doesn't do much with irregular pronounciations; we worked on those seperately.Overall, I'd recommend it, however don't expect your child to plead with you to work in the book!"
4,I do recommend this!,"This easy to follow step by step program is great. My only drawback is I think there could be more focus on phonics, but there is a strong emphasis. However, it has worked for 2 of my kids. (Ages 5 and 7 now, started at age 4.) The 20 minute lessons give the kids such a feeling of self-satisfaction. It is a miracle teaching your child to read! Anyone could do this. There is a lot of reading at the beginning, before you get started. Don't be overwhelmed. It all flows quickly and makes sense. As you go through, you have to trust your instinct every now and then. But by the end, WOW!!! You and your child will feel great! And BOTH of you will be readers!I am not a home schooler. My children go to a fine public school. I just wanted to do a bit more."
5,teacher recommends method,"I am a special ed. teacher for little ones. I teach reading to the 2nd graders who just ""don't get it"". This is the book I used in conjunction with ""the rules of reading"" and other phonics techniques. It works! I have given it to my own children and friends to use with THEIR normal children. I would suggest it for normal 3-5 year olds and older for children with various learning disabilities. It might get ""boring"" for older children, so with them you have to have a child who wants to learn and is willing to realize that reading is difficult for them and are willing to put up with lower age subject matter. Be creative."
5,My child can read!,This has been the easiest approach to helping my children read. I have used it for my first child and am half way through with my second! I love the scripted lessons and that it gives them confidence. I have recommended it several times and it has proven successful!
5,Great way to teach your child to read...,Just go at your own (and more importantly your child's own) pace. There's no need to rush - and don't try to complete the 100 lessons in 100 consecutive days. Some days your child will want to do a lesson and some days they will need a day off. My daughter (just turned 4) is on lesson 21. We take at least 2 days off each week. Even on lesson 21 she is reading sentences! This book teaches reading phonetically and the kids learn to 'sound it out.' They learn sounds - not letters - but even now if I am reading or as we are driving or anywhere she will say - 'oh - I know that sound' and proceeds to say the sound or even sound out the whole word! It's awesome! I'm sure it will put her ahead of the game when she starts school but more importantly to me I hope it helps foster a love of reading by making it easy to read. Highly recommended - just remember - go slow and at your child's comfort level. Don't push.
1,Not useful for parents trying to teach their children,"This book is not child friendly nor parent friendly. It is extremely difficult to follow, and even when I followed it step by step, the steps were so boring that my child lost interest almost immediately. I had hoped this would be a text that would a text that would facilitate reading in a fun way, but it is definitely not."
2,Boring!!!,"I am glad I didn't spend a penny on this book because it was given to me. I am giving it a 2 star because I know I can find something useful in it after all it has a million and one pages. There are so many reading programs out there. Every parent and every child will like different things and find success at it. That being said, some may really like this style, I don't personally. I like Leap Frog videos, Leap Pad ( discontinued but great!), Hooked on Phonics ( the ones with the DVD not the CD Rom versions), other phonics videos."
2,"Wordy, inconsistent, confusing,","In a few words, I found this book very inconsistent and confusing. Sight words are ignored completely. Too many funny symbols that could have been dealt with just one type. There is text that you are supposed to follow(the parent part) which is rather useless. I kept getting sidetracked by my daughter while trying to read it they way they suggest. Why all this regimentation? The pages are intimidating for a child. The stories in most cases are too long for child just starting out. There are better books out there. Look for them. I dont suggest this book, as you wont finish it."
1,Just can't do it.,"This book sucks. I just can't get past the weird lettering. I think it's a Northwest thing. Coming from Vegas and moving to Washington, they had introduced this type of learning to my son who was in kindergarten at the time. He's now in second grade and still struggles a bit with his reading. So, I've been doing sight words with him and he is reading much faster. I want to send this back so bad."
1,Awful!,"I wonder how so many people liked this book?! I guess if you want to teach sight reading, it may work. We needed a phonics book, as my kids were trying to sound out words and this book ""skips"" over letters. You know what I mean if you look inside it. Much better is ""Phonics Pathways"" for teaching to read and has fun and easy games."
5,You can teach your child to read.,"I didn't teach my child over-night, because I was sick and had to stop. They forget fast, but catch up later. I think it is great for learning phonics. I wouldn't live without."
3,Bring on the Tears,"This book does what it says it does. The lessons are simple, easy to teach and boring. My child was very excited to read. Now it is the worst part of our day. We are on lesson 63. My son CAN read. Unfortunately now he absolutely hates the idea. I am giving this book away and trying something new. It doesn't matter if the book teaches him to read if it also teaches him to hate it."
4,It Works,"This book worked so well for us that my son wouldn't even let me read the lessons to him, he started reading them to me! A very easy guide, totally recommend."
4,WORKS!,"This is the second time I have used this book to teach a child to read. Almost 20 years ago I used this book to teach my 4 year old daughter to read. I purchased this copy to teach my 4 year old grandson to read. They are sponges at this age. When I taught my daughter we followed the plan of one lesson per day. Because I don't see my grandson daily we complete 4-5 per session. The first day he was reading two and three letter words. He gets so excited when it is ""reading"" time. The only con I had 20 years ago is my daughter had a little trouble with spelling in early elementary school years. She started first grade reading at a third grade level. Her spelling improved quickly. I love this book. I would recomend this to any parent that wants to give thier child a head start on reading."
4,100 EZ Lessons,"My four-year old daughter and I are almost halfway through this book. Although some have mentioned this book as tedious, she asks to do her reading. Yes, at times, she doesn't want to focus on her lesson or whines or gives up, but that just creates an opportunity for us to focus on developing her character. It also helps me to grow in my character when I get impatient. It does often take us more than 20 minutes to complete a lesson, however. I do wonder, as well, whether some drilling of common words would be beneficial. We're looking forward to completing this book and will figure out how to proceed from there."
5,Mom of 4 year old,"When my son started asking what letter does this word or that word start with all day we decided he really just wanted to learn to read, so I found this book. I am now teaching my 4 year old to read (and write). The thing I didn't expect was that my 2 year old daughter would start sounding out letters and words in the grocery store!!! One thing I have noticed is that there are some typos in the book (as with any other book) but sometimes they can annoy me and a few have caused my son to pronounce a word incorrectly but I wouldn't let that stop me from recomending the book to anyone!"
2,"Well structured, but boring","We liked the program, at first. But now (lesson 41) it's such a chore that we're taking time off from it, going back to more mommy read-alouds, and looking for something a little more enjoyable for my 5-year-old. Either a new curriculum or I revamp this one with some creativity. I like the layout and the consistent building of sounds, as well as the easy-to-follow teacher instructions. BUT... we just started a math program, too, and I realized how much more she's enjoying that, with its variety of approaches to the repetitive activity. There are lots of different ways to practice counting to five - there have to be more creative ways to practice our sounds and simple words, right?!?"
4,It works,"I used this book to teach my daughter to read before she started kindergarten last year. She is now in 1st grade and reading on a 3rd grade level. I am glad that she had that head start. My son will be starting kindergarten in the Fall and I am now using it to give him that same head start. I have a few friends that have used this book, including a few that gave up on it. All of my friends agree that this book works. Don't let the title fool you though, it is ANYTHING BUT EASY. Plus, only the first 50 lessons take less than 20 minutes. It takes an upbeat attitude, an incredible amount of patience, and continually increasing the motivation as the lessons get longer."
3,Still working with it,I chose this as a teaching tool for at home. It has mostly been easy to understand. I would recommend this.
3,"Good start to reading, but far from perfect","I've been using this book for about 4 months with my 4 year old daughter and 5.5 year old son. I definitely like the way every lesson is scripted out, but once I felt comfortable with the format I improvised. I also like the way the letter sounds are introduced and practiced. However, we're over halfway through and have reached a level of tedium and stagnation, especially with my son who finds it difficult to sit still for ""20"" minutes. (After about lesson 30, it has been taking him 30-40!) We will probably put it away for awhile and do some other phonics/reading activities. There are more typos than I would like, b/c at this stage of learning kids get confused easily. I would also enjoy a bit more variety in our lessons-I want my kids to actually ENJOY learning to read. So, for us this book is a good solid start to phonics, but not the only resource we will use."
4,Good for kids not familiar with letters,"I bought this book for my 5 and 4 year olds. I LOVED the concept and can see how wonderfully it would work with young kids who have not yet been introduced to letters.My kids were already very familiar with the names and sounds of the letters and did not like to call them ""sounds"". We stopped using the books for now because they are reading well with phonics and love the other books we have. However, maybe at some point they will get confused with words where the sounds don't make much sense.I might return to this book and continue from the last half - it is amazing the texts kids can read if they follow this book religiously!!!"
5,He's a READER!,"I want to start by saying that this program should not be used by a child who already knows how to read and is having trouble...it's used to actually teach a child to read by the assumption that they are not familiar with sounds. That said, my child was reading words in less than 30 days using this book. He could easily finish a Dr. Seuss book with little/no help at all. His eyes actually glowed with the excitement of a new sound being introduced and it became fun for both of us to see his progress. You have to be consistent with the lessons but what I like about it is that it tells you (the parent) EXACTLY what to say while instructing your child. I can tell you as a parent that if you are willing to take the 20 minutes a day and use this book, your child will be reading in no time."
4,Pretty Neat...,"I've watched my wife go through this book with our 4 year old girl over the last few weeks. I have been amazed at how quick she has caught on to things and how well she is reading already. No system is perfect, but this seems to work for us."
5,Tracks Lite -Sturdy but Light!,"This is my second tracks lite. (My first Tracks Lite was taken over by another hiker who liked it a lot.) It is ergonomic in that it fits the hand and the strap is handy and comfortable. It has the advantage of coming in several lengths to account for your height, but none of the problems of adjustable poles that can collapse in mid-hike! The light weight makes it easy to use without tiring. The non-skid end makes it better to use for snowy and rocky terrain than poles with points."
4,"Todd, live on tour","I feel this rates 4 stars because the musical content reminds me of his 1975 CD, Initiation. I really enjoyed ""The smell of money"". I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Todd's music. ""Kindness"" is a really good song too. Get this CD now."
4,"A Worthy Follow Up to ""Nearly Human""","Though Todd has been enamored of computers for decades now, he has always been able to show the soul inside the machine. That said, this album, which was recorded live while asking the audience to hold their applause (similar to Joe Jackson's ""Big World""), is a solid follow up to the best album of 1989, ""Nearly Human."" Like that album, this album is chock full of soul, and Todd's oh-so-soulful voice! ""Change Myself"" is a song that has inspired me for years, and one of the best of his long career. ""The Smell of Money"" would sound great in a Broadway show, and ""If I Have To Be Alone,"" as others have commented, is gut-wrenching in its beauty. Credit must also go to his stellar backing band, which includes many of those who backed him up on ""Nearly Human."""
5,very helpful,"This digestive enzyme helps me, I take it twice a day with a meal. I have used PDA for about 5 years."
2,Unstable and Overpriced,"I bought one with my PM66, and I don't much care for the design and the price. Although it's well made, the three-wheel set-up is unstable, and the saw will tilt with a fairly light touch. The swiveling wheel does not have a swivel lock, so even when everything is locked down, the saw will still shift unexpectedly. I drilled and tapped holes for heavy eye-bolts in the corners opposite the fixed wheels. The eye-bolts form outriggers that steady the saw and compensate for any uneveness in the floor. This is something that the maker should have provided. I'd recommend instead the Grizzly Shop-Fox mobile base which has four wheels and outriggers and costs less."
2,Repeat Material,"Good songs, but What Hits released in 1992 contains every one of these songs plus more. Spend the extra money to get a better album."
4,a must for chili pepper fans!,"This is a great disc that has some of the greatest songs the Red Hot Chili Peppers have ever made. If you love the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you must buys this! Even if you only like a few of their songs, this is something you still can enjoy!!!"
4,High Class Drama,"I'm not upper middle or high class, but I felt I could enjoy that life and its problems through, ""Never Kiss and Tell."" The characters were captivating! There was excellent use of forshadowing, and somehow I was still surprised at what came next! Howard provided excellent character development and made sure to tie all loose ends! Great Job Tracie! This book is a must read!"
4,Great Book,"I really enjoyed this book; not as much as I enjoyed Tracie's other novel ""Gold Diggers"", but this is a great read."
4,"Started off slow, but the middle and ending was GOOD","One of my coworkers suggested I read this book because in her words...""This book is GOOD! You won't be able to put it down!"" So I took a chance on a new author and I do have to agree with the majority and say it did have a slow start. I thought about returning the book to my coworker twice, but I hung in there and I must say, I was very pleased with the storyline and colorful characters.The characters were believable and didn't seem made up at all. I was very impressed with this author's knowledge of the Wall Street and high society life. Very impressed! The ending had some good surprises that made the story altogether a good one!"
1,sadly bad,I wanted to love this book. Franz Adam and I share the same last name and so he must be some sort of kinsman. The truth is this is not worth the time it requires to read it. It is apparently a novel set in a German garrison around 1900. It chronicals the disasters that befall the soldiers and their families and it is not possible to care.
5,"PSI Woodworking LCSIXW High Speed Steel Wood Lathe Chisel Turning Set, 6-Piece","Nice set of Chisels. I turn smaller items on a Jet lathe and use my smaller chisel set more. But the large chisels have worked well for bowls and smaller jobs as well. This set wasnt the most expensive or the cheapest out there, but the quality is good! For the average user this is a great set of chisels that will not disapoint."
3,Light bulbs were NOT included,"Installed the fan, it looked great... went to install the bulbs and they were not included in the box like the description states... they aren't standard bulbs, only candelabra bulbs which I didn't have on hand so I was left without any light until the next day when I could buy candelabra bulbs. Other than that it's a beautiful product."
1,broken glass,broken glass on one of the bells - Westinghouse doesn't care. We purchased three of these and they were delivered in a timely manner but one of the glass bells was broken in transit and Westinghouse has yet to respond to any inquiries through their online forms or their customer service number which dumped me into someone's voice mail. This would be so easily taken care of by having a human to either answer the customer service Hot-Line (LOL) or respond to your own created online forms.OOOF---updatery = 75 days later and Westinghouse still hasn't delivered replacement glass.
3,no brainer enterainer,"There are some interesting pieces very rare, difficult to hear elsewhere if at all. Kunzel is no Boskovsky and Cincinnati Orchestra is no Vienna Philharmonic for sure, this to say that you cannot really find the viennese flair you might be used to, nevertheless it is a good collection and as said there are some rarities too. All pros? almost. There is one con and it is the wretched soprano voice intruding in Voices of Spring Waltz destroying the athmosphere and shrieking her way to the end.That aside it would be 4 easy stars."
1,Disappointing,"In the past I've relished the music on Telarc recordings, but not on this one. I found the sound quality thin and quavering, the soprano in ""Voices of Spring"" as if recorded in the 19th century with no remastering. In my opinion Viennese waltzes should be lavish, round and full in tone."
4,viennafest,very nicely put together.reminds me of my fathers love for the country of his birth.he was musically inclined..
5,Perfect!,"I have 10 dogs, with that being said you can imagine the expense of having all of these ""outside"" dogs groomed! This product has been WONDERFUL for us! The dogs actually look forward to their bath now. I am tall and could use one that has longer legs on it but all in all it takes the stress off of your back so much!! I wish I would have had this product years ago! Better late than never!!!"
5,Booser Bath 5 Stars,"Love it! I have 3 small dogs, and bathing them in the bathtub was killing my back. The Booster Bath solved my problem!"
4,Good tub!,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers regarding the height of the tub - it should be about 4-6 inches higher to take complete pressure off your back. I am 5'4"" and I was still bending over a bit washing my medium sized dog. Overall though, it was an energy and back pain saver! It was very easy to put together and then take apart and store afterwards. Still a bit on the pricey side, but it is sturdy, thick plastic. I recommend it!"
4,love it!,"I have five dogs, large to small. Using the Booster Bath was easy on me and safe for them. Assembly was easy except for the shampoo holder. I had a little trouble attaching it, but with a little help from my husband it was fully assembled in less than an hour. It is very sturdy and stable, one of my large dogs, about 65 lbs., jumps in and out with no problem at all. The water and HAIR rinsed out the drain hose easily which made clean up a breeze. I worked with each dog in the dry tub to get them familiar with their new Booster Bath before the actual bath. Then once it was bath time everybody did great! No scared faces, only happy dogs! The Booster Bath makes it so much easier to bathe my furry babies, I love it!"
4,Easy on the back,"Great to have a place to bath my large Poodles in. They hung over the laundry tub. The walls on this are a little shorter than a laundry tub and the legs are a tad short (I""m 5'3) but great product great quality."
5,Easy is a Good Thing!,Bathing our dogs used to be a dreaded task for the dogs and for us. This tub takes the stress off our knees and backs and our new puppy relaxes and enjoys the process. We have also found that it is the best place to groom him without a fight. We can actually bath the dog while sitting in our lawn chairs. How easy is that! Our only challange will be during the cold weather months we will have to find a way to extend the drain hose to reach a floor drain.
4,No bath time blues!,Overall a great product. The only problems I've encountered so far are:-The hose nozzle is too big and not flexible enough. I think a push button on/off would be better than the dial.-The harness and collar do not adjust down enough - leave too much wiggle room.The best part is not having to be bent over all the time. A back saver!
3,"Great for big dogs, but too low for little ones. Avoid tropic shower","I've had mine for a couple of years and it's still holding up. I keep it outside, so it's take the weather fine (though this is California). It assembled very easily and I got the ramp, which is definitely worth it. My only problem is that it's too low for small dogs. The bottom is knee high, so you can get a back ache. The sink is better for my cavi.It's very convenient if your dog is always getting muddy and needs a quick hosing off. If not, I'd stick to taking them to the dog wash at the pet food store.I also bought the hot water mixer, they call the "" tropic shower "" - The off/on valves are made of very cheap pot metal and broke after a few uses. They ([...]) promised to send me a replacement, but never did and would not answer my follow-up e-mails. Anyway, you can build your own for less money."
2,Had to hide them in the closet because I don't want to get asked to read them...,"Moralizing, dull....Did I say DULL?...preachy.... Only thing I like about these books is the colorful illustrations and the glittery scales of the fish. The message--about the pitfalls of arrogance and prejudice and the value of sharing and friendship and inclusivity-- is presented in such a way that I invariably want to toss the books across the room. I'll look elsewhere for children's books that deal with these subjects. There's just no subtlety, no humor, no surprise to these books. I'm not quite sure why they've won such notoriety, frankly. Maybe it's those glittery scales. Gheesh."
1,Generalizing with only Male pronouns is bad for baby girls!,"This book is so beautiful, it was about to be a gift to all the youngsters on my list, but when I opened the pix on-line there was the fish referred to only as HE, now how about the more than 50% of us that are girl, girlfish, etc. Let's not keep doing the same indoctrination of young minds. No matter how attractive the illustrations, sexism whould not be taught to our babies if we expect the world to improve. Sorry. I would rate it only one star for this reason alone"
5,The best learning software for children age 4 and up,"My daughter loves this cd-rom, it has many different learning games, and includes phonics, matching, letters, sounds. It's a wonderful program and also entertaining for the parents. You child will love it. There is a report card area that shows the parent how well your child is doing in the different skills. I was at little unsure about buying this program, but now I realize it was well worth it."
3,Not as good as the older preschool version,"Since my daughter really enjoyed the older preschool version, I was excited about getting this cd rom. The difference is drastic. There isn't a reward system like the older version. Some of the activities aren't clearly explained. The '99 version for preschoolers was much better. My daughter rarely uses this version."
1,Jump Start Kindergarten,"Rather than approach learning as an enjoyable experience, this cd presents a structured environment that screams of lessons not games. This cd is successful however, in presenting a balance between pressure, judgement and success vs. failure. Additionally, the skill level is more for preschoolers. Edmark Millie and Bailey Kindergarten is a much better route to take for your childs enjoyment."
3,The sexy little PDA that was almost a 10,My main complaint about this PDA and why I won't buy one is the fact that this little PDA offers absolutely no expendability. Not even a Compact Flash expansion pack. Nope all you get is USB sync and an SD slot. If they would have designed just a little bit of expendability this would have been a real winner. Right now I'm waiting to see what the AXIM does to the Pocket PC world.
2,it can lose all data at any time,"This is a sweet unit with a fatal flaw - it can come one, and stay on, until the battery is completely drained. Complete data loss. HP is in denial about this."
2,"Good product, but not for long",I bought this a while ago and loved it. Then once the warranty expired it went on the fritz. The unit freezes with the backlight on. Once this happens it can't be turned off unless the battery is removed. This causes it to rest and all information is lost. I would not recomend this product.
2,ipaq 1910 freezes and drains the battery - a common problem,"very promising machine with one big disadvantage, which HP does want to admit in: there is a basic hardware/software problem which causes the machine to turned on (probably due to reminder) and then drains the battery. there is no solution for that, and it happens in many machines (including mine).Be aware. This symptom means that you don't have a reliable machine, and I believe that this is the main reason why I recommend to buy a different brand."
2,Having power problems,"Like the graphics and the options. Don't know why I keep loosing my memory. The battery looses power fast. Purchased a new $30 battery, still having problems. The product is nice but Im not sure buying used is a good idea. They say it's been tested and is like new but Im still having issues. Have tried to use it to keep information for work but now Ive lost everything Ive been working on. Not good. The seller has given me some options. Not really pleased with my product, love the idea and the look, if I can keep my memory. Still working through glitchs."
2,"nice, if you don't mind randomly losing your data","The unit will sometimes leave the display on. This happens without warning. When it does happen, the battery drains down to nothing, and all your data is lost. HP denies there's a design flaw, but just search google for iPAQ 1910 battery problem and you'll see I'm not the only one with this problem. Otherwise, it's a great unit. I'm going to try and get a refund for mine, and buy something else which doesn't have this problem."
3,Good product with dumb flaws,"I agree with the people who have said that this is a lovely, functional, little pocket PC. But it has a couple of stupid design errors.One of the advantages of owning a pocket PC is that you can download books from Audible.com. In terms of total time spent, listening to audio books is is one of the main ways I use these machines - when commuting, air travel, exercising and so on.The problem with this model is that the 2.5mm jack ear phones are [weak], break easily and then are bloody hard to replace. No one in Bangkok ... seems to stock them. Amazon.com and other online retailers do have some, but will not ship electronic items overseas.So for the sake of a [small] item, a key benefit of this machine is lost to me. ...In addition, I changed from a previous IPAQ to this model because of the size advantage. However, none of my IPAQ accessories (cradles and keyboards) fit this model. And, keyboards for this model are difficult to find...."
3,Needs more memory,"Disadvantages: 1. Not enough memory, to get more memory you would have to purchase a SD card which cost about 80$2. you have to download software to get more out of your pocket pc, software which cost more money.3. Cradle not included, which cost more moneyOverall the potential is worth the buyThe HP should have added more software to it."
3,Everything Perfect except for Screen Tilt,"The screen is the area that is raved by every reviewer. I must admit the screen is pretty nice until you notice the screen is tilted. The battery life is plain short. Two to three hours on medium even low brightness. I must admit however the screen is very bright. Secure digital memory expansion is not a big deal since there aren't that many useful applications, plus PDA's get outdated so soon. I picked Dell Axim for several reasons. Better battery life, no screen tilt(this issue really irritated me, better price, and better value."
3,Good device... but.... Think twice !!!,"This IPAQ 1910 or 1915 (Europe) its a nice device with a very good screen and it works OK... but there are bad things too.HP will not make available upgrades to PocketPC 2003 and this is bad. Plus it crashes a little bit especialy with the use of SD cards.Finally, it has no cradle.I should be considered only if low cost is the master key or if the user will only use the device for simple functions.To install must of the software and retain some memory to run it a SD Card has to be installed."
4,"The Pocket PC is great, but....","I bought my 1910 when it came out in Dec. 2002. I wanted something that literally would fit in my shirt pocket without feeling that I was carrying a lump of coal in there. I considered the then-new Dell pocket PC, but this one was smaller, lighter, and at least as capable. Functionally, I definitely give it 5 stars. In particular, the display is as bright and crisp as on the more expensive iPAQ models. My dissatisfaction is, to a degree, my own fault. I knew when I bought it that no accessories for other iPAQ models would be compatible. But I thought that in a few months, either HP or third parties would address this. However, there is still no reasonably priced custom-fit case for it, nor a keyboard or modem. Maybe sales haven't been high enough to justify this. If you view this as a top-end PDA on which you can play MS solitaire, rather than as a fully functional pocket PC, then you should be extrememly pleased."
2,"hp1910 - Nice size, lousy hardware, would not buy again","I've used PDAs for 10+ years and this unit does not compare favorably. Best features: Screen is great, software on the PDA works great. Three biggest drawbacks: 1)Unprotected buttons on front and side lead to inadvertent activation of software and battery drain whenever the unit is touched (think pocket, purse or briefcase), 2) this unit communicates only through synchronization, there is no way to communicate with any other hardware (no GPS, no serial port connection, etc.), and 3) the Microsoft ActiveSync software and/or the interface with this device is buggy (I've had lots of problems that were only recoverable by finding and deleting folders and files on my PC and then starting the connection process from scratch). I would not buy this product again and was very disappointed to uncover the missing serial port capability (not obvious until I got the unit home)."
3,Beautiful in the Outside! So so in the Inside.,"I have to be honest, i was a little disappointed. This Pda is absolutely stunning, simple, the LCD is great, the color are amazing but the battery wears off real quickly, even though it is connected to the pc. I do not use that much and before you know it the battery is dying. HP needs to come up with something better for their batteries. The letter recognizer do not even waste your time on it. What happenned with the case, that is the leats HP can do, include a case! and a standard headphone jack."
5,"Fantastic PDA, easy to carry!","I have used windows CE / Pocket PC devices in the past. But I switchd to a Palm Vx a couple of years ago, because the Windows CE devices were just too big. This one got me back to using windows CE. It fits in my pocket has a wonderful display and is just fun to use.I need to sell my Palm Vx :-)Wish the SD slot supported SDIO which would allow for wireless support in the future. The SD slot is only good for memory cards."
4,"Excellent, but beware non-standard headphone jack!","Everything I've read in the other reviews is correct. Pocket PC finally matches Palm in size and weight, having surpassed this other operating system in all other aspects. However, what made HP decide to put a non-standard 2.5 mm plug for audio in the 1910 instead of the standard 3.5mm minijack? One of the reasons why I use a Pocket PC is its ability to play audio, and if this is high in your priorities, make sure that you have this question solved. What an unfortunate way to create an uncalled for problem in what otherwise is an extraordinary product!"
4,quasi is not pop music,"this recording is more varied than r+b transmogrification. the songs are almost all about the monotony of life (and thats why we love mr. coomes), but it has many rockin melodies, as well."
5,"As good as indiepop gets, and that's gooood!","Goodness me, what's to say? This is straight up the best, most gorgeously acid-tongued, catchiest, singalongable, ecstatically depressed record I've heard in ages. Such wit & charm! Every song stands up to the most grueling quality tests. This record just does not get old as you listen to it over and over and over again. So buy it, there is no possibility of disappointment and they could probably use the money besides."
4,neat-O,"This is a sparkling gem in the ever draining pool of indie music. Quasi's ""Featuring Birds"" is easily one of the best records I've heard in a long time. If you like this check out modest Mouse :)"
4,"Pop, Pop, Fizz, Fizz, oh what a relief it is!","One of the few good releases of 1998. Quasi could best be described as a mix between the Butthole Surfers and Cindy Lauper. (just kidding}. In all seriousness this is a powerful album that really should have gotten more recognition then it did. From happy, sappy, pop songs to three minutes of annoying ""Bird"" samples ""featuring birds"" rules."
4,Wished I had read this book a long time ago,"This book was written for guys on how to spot and avoid selfish and manipulative women aka ""dirty sisters."" Let's face it. We men have been sold a bill of goods by the media and magazines that play on our need to have sex and find a lasting relationship. What they don't give you is a guide on how to find Ms. Right while avoiding Ms. Wrong. This book is that guide.Contents include a list of the seven types of women, what their motives are, and how to avoid them. It even gives some celebrity examples for each type. However, I had one gripe: there weren't enough celebrity examples, but I guess that's just the gossip in me."
1,Nous sommes ainsi amusé,"Amusing for perhaps just a moment. But we believe that our authoress is of the mind that she has none of the objectionable traits of these Sept Soeurs Mortelles. Mayhap this is true but it would seems that she is the eighth type, the ""Felis Domesticus"".Now this is a prefectly delightful book for the self-centered and the in-denial; those who are most likely attracted to the dysfunctionality she so scathingly limns in her pop-culture People-esque style. Analysis by celebrity is right up there with horoscopes as barometer and psychological tool extraordinaire.If this authoress taught the bitter man likely to purchase this book why he perpetually seeks out unstable women, what there is within himself that needs further examination, this nasty little diatribe would not be necessary. And we The Dirty Sisters would be left alone, in peace, and untroubled."
1,gargantua soul has very little heart,"wow, this is one of the most contrived records i have ever heard! terrible production.....bad musicianship....redundent themes (the tribe?).....trying to kiss up to corporate rock A&R guys to get signed by playing into this whole rap/rock/punk/funk thing.....give it up folks! don't buy this record unless you want to be dissapointed or you can buy it if you have no taste or mind of your own.....crap!"
2,So far nothing,Worn the 'scent' three times now with no noticeable effects on the opposite sex at all. Beginning to think its a dud.
4,Its worth a try!,"I bought this to see if this stuff actually works. So far after a month the only women I notice that seem more interested are older ones, not so much younger 20 year olds. If I had to do it again I'd buy it."
3,not so effective,"This pheromone is from one of the predecessor pheromone cologne creator, but whatever it is, extract and create pheromone is not cheap, so making a potent pheromone will come with a hefty price tag, so even if James V Kohl is a famous researcher in Pheromone, he can't make a pheromone that is highly effective with 50$. The amount of pheromone in SOE is not high enough, 5 mg per bottle is too little, compare to with the same money, I will get 5 times the amount of pheromone in other pheromone cologne brand.But it is one of the product that work, not a scam"
2,eh....,"I tried this out. I haven't noticed a difference in regards to female attraction. When a girl was close enough, where her face was on my neck, she could smell it, because that's where I put it and she said I smelled good. But, if she's already that close, chances are that I don't really need any further help. They make it sound like it is a chick magnet. No, I didn't get girls swarming toward me when I put this on. It does smell good though."
5,You Should Read It,"Although this is a fast-reading book, you should read it thoughtfully whether you are a liberal or a conservative; whether you favor or are opposed to affirmative action.It shows how a truly color-blind society is best for all, and not a society of quotas and preferences which is based on the incorrect assumption that some people are inferior."
3,not exactly as depicted,this paper is thin and somewhat see-through... and a lighter color than the picture shows.
5,Very potent when dosed properly,"1) You will need a cover scent.2) Works great in conjuction with WAGG or SOEMy wife was on me like we were in our 20's again! It has an effect. Her lifelong girlfriend stopped over, and I think it caused an unwanted (although good for my ego) effect. Everyone in the situation just seemed more sensual. Nothing happened, but if it was ever going to, it could have. Again, this would have been helpful in our 20's...It does stink, and you have to shake it up. I will tell you that this particular blend is ultra powerful, and use it sparingly. No one would ever say that you aren't getting a strong blend...Good luck, and remember to use it very sparingly. Less is more..."
4,"Obviously works, and is kind of fun","So it hasn't gotten me laid, but it's affects according to my gay friend and my ex-girlfriend are that their hands feel a little numb, it moves kind of up their forearm and makes them relaxed, for the wearer (me) it kind of makes me feel almost lightheaded."
1,Did not smell anything....,"I just got it in mail last night and, I did not smell ANYTHING at all.... Like water...but it was a sealed bottle....Obviously, there was no response from ladies either.Anybody had the same experience, contrasting what some other people are describing above?"
3,NPA Still Pending,"I finnally purchased this product. I can honestly say, i didnt notice much diffrence in the responses i got from women. I was a little buzzed so maybe i wasnt being attentive enough. Im a very socialeble person so i really dont need anything to help me be confident or more aggressive. I didnt feel more aggressive from using the product. I'll have to put it to another test. Nothing out of the ordinary occured. It's all to your perception. I could say some of the things that happend in my interactions could be attributed to the npa but i feel like its a strecth cause nothing spectacular happened. i'll have to use it on a 1 one 1 date and then provide another review. If your wanting a story to tell your friends this product likely is not going to provide that..."
2,Strong.,"Pheromones are not for me, and this stuff stinks. If you want natural attraction from YOUR OWN pheromones, eat a lot of celery. This is scientifically proven to turn women on. Good luck."
5,I LOVE RICKY BELL !,i love ricky bell i love him new edition and bell biv deVoe and now his solo show she can do his thang
4,charming and interesting reprint,"This is a spare but informative little volume that will inform you about the origin of many place names in the nation's three northeasternmost states. Originally published in 1909, the book begins with a preface respectful of the region's aborigines and an introduction that discusses the principal tribes of the area; these are articulate and thoughtful, and a real pleasure to read. There are chapters for each state (Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont) with brief, alphabetically-arranged entries of Native American names, many translated, for cities, towns, rivers, streams, lakes, waterfalls and islands.The book concludes with a list and short descriptions of the regional tribes, a list of Abnaki words and a bibliography."
2,only one stocking,i guess the stocking is alright but BRWARE....there is only one stocking in the package...i thought it would come in pairs.....so that makes the price high also....
4,I did not pay attention to size...,"I did not return it because I'm using it for my arthritic elbow which it does fit.Remember PAY ATTENTION to size/dimensions....I've done this before. So there is no problem with the product itself except it does not fit, and that is my fault. And where I can actually use it. It works.Thank you."
5,Great product!,This has been a great product. Just the right amount of compression for extra support during physical activity. I have mild to medium vericose veins and this was a great alternative to support hose. I am young and very active and participate in sports and this was a very good buy!!! Fast Shipping and good price.
3,Nice DVD set but missing project details,"I really like the diversity of project topics, but many projects while informative; were focused on home maintenance. I was a bit disappointed by the DVD; perhaps because I was looking for something that was focused on basic home remodeling.In 4 DVD's there were precious few projects that an aspiring-to-intermediate level home owner/remodeler would find of much value. Here's what was missing: No drywall installation; No basic home electrical; No basic plumbing/fixtures; No kitchen remodeling; no construction layout and framing (room additions); and no roofing repairs. If you're looking for specific direction on these important topics, my advice is to look elsewhere.Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of techniques to learn from this DVD set, but if you're looking for a broad range of home remodeling topics; you won't find it here."
2,Deeply disturbing artwork.,"Some of the artwork was wonderful but a lot of these folk had almost insane looks on their faces and differant types of races in this deck. A lot of the artwork was 'fuzzy' to see. Almost like a camera that was out of focus. The meanings in the lwb were hardly helpful for the minors and the lwb did state that this deck is for experts. Overall a good deck but be prepared for some graphic nudity and perhaps some almost gorey pics. No I don't go for the swords being a bright red fire suit and I don't buy into the staves being such a dreary air suit. Though if you care to, you can see the deeper meaning in the artwork if you care to look carefully beyond the obvious violence or graphic whatever. The emperor in this deck is quiet fascinating to me!"
1,haven't recieved,you know I would love to give a real review but I have yet to recieve this product so I am extremely disappointed.. not only that but this isn't the first time something hasnt gotten to me so I am contemplating never using Amazon.com again...
4,Fits and works,A good replacement part for my aprilair humidifier. Fits nicely and works. The price was good to for what I could find.
5,"Great saw, company and price","The Bottom Line with only a few minor issues, the saw stands out as a great saw. The price and service solidify my choice of this saw."
2,Too small,"It is too small a mail-box. I got it since the mailbox provided by my landlord is too small and my netflix DVDs would not go in it. It is my mistake, really, that I did not check the dimensions of this product closely, but when I got it, I found that DVDs do not enter even in this one! Waste of my money.Note that I am not saying that the product itself has any flaws: it may have, or may not have; I have not used it to know; but it is too small for DVDs from netflix."
5,Just Wonderful!,"Let me start by saying that Amazon's reviewer has made some terrible mistakes in describing the picture. It IS NOT 16:9. It is 4:3 as clearly stated on the dvd's back cover. So, there is no problem with the image being distorted. Also, even though I played this dvd on a cheap player without progressive scan, there was absolutely no graininess, no out of focus pictures. In fact the picture was extremely sharp and clear.Performance - Claudio Abbado & Berlin Philharmonic - top of the line.Two soloists really stood out. Anne Sophie Von Otter's voice was warm and rich, and Gil Shaham's virtuosity on violin was breathtaking.Other reviewers have remarked that this is as good any performance dvd of classical music they've ever seen and I eagerly agree."
5,"Ahhhh, What a DVD !!!!","If you not have this DVD in your collection, believe me, buy it.First, the performace of the Berlin Philharmonic, impresionant.You will hear the Carmen highlights arias with Anne Sophie Von Otter, Bryn Terfel, Robert Alagna, then the Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Paganini Theme only for the climax of the Sarasate's Carmen Fantasy; perfectlty performed by Gil Shaham, if you put attention you really see that all the performers of the DVD enjoy his own sound. If you like the Berlin Philarmonic perform, wait for the Hungarian Dance V, conducted by Claudio Abbado, i repeat the guys really enjoy playing music."
2,Jesus & Israel: One Covenant or Two?,This book came in a timely manner and was in great condition. This author used way too many words to say not much. It never came to a clear conclusion. Typical amilennialism. I was glad it was short.
1,Perpetuating the old Dogma,"This is an excellent book for getting to know the standard but flawed Replacement Theology Christianty has handed down since the early gentile Church Fathers. It is very sad, however, that authors like Mr. Holwerda are not aware of the destructive and unsupportable nature of this old theological position. Thier heads are in the 2000 year old theological sand.For accurate theological balance and history concerning crucial Jewish - Christian dialogue see books like: ""The God Of Israel and Christian Theology"" by Kendall Soulen, or ""Has God Only One Blessing?"" by Mary C. Boys, or ""Our Father Abraham"" by Marvin Wilson, or ""Irrenconcilable Differences?"" by both Christian and Jewish scholars, among many other sources of good, current information from respected Christian and Jewish theologians."
2,"The Author of Me-Me-Me, I-I-I","The concept of this work is both unique and intriguing while the execution was boring and trite. I'm certain that persons more familiar with German literature and authors will take great offense at my brief analysis but I learned more about everyone else in Germany than I did about Marcel Reich-Raniki. The first half of the book did keep me interested but always wanting for more, more about him & his wife and a lot less about Max Frisch et al. I was also put-off by his constant references to himself and how important he was. He was lucky to survive the holocost, lucky to have such a position in Germany after the war, but should have left the writing to those whom he reviewed."
1,Useless product; ridiculous customer service,"I bought this product about one year ago. I was not able to use it in either of my computers. They both use Vista Windows and I was not ale to download it. I contacted Britannica's customer service by telephone and they promised to send a replacement product, which they never did."
3,Not For Purists,"If you have an ear for the original recordings, then this collection is not for you. On tracks like ""The Rabbit of Seville"" the switch from the original soundtrack to the modern re-recording is both jarring and unsatisfying. If you loved the ""live"" show then this may bring back some memories for you. If you want to hear the original performances of the great music from Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, I recommend ""The Carl Stalling Project"" instead."
3,Cute CD for Looney Tunes fans,"Sure, it's not for everyone's taste but no fan of Bugs or Daffy can be without this CD. Outside of the famous 'Merry Go Round Broke Down' and Merrie Melodies theme the Looney Tunes cartoons are well known for paying tribute to and parodying classical music and there's loads of that behavior to be had on this CD. The popular song 'What's Up Doc' is also featured here and there's just enough of Daffy Duck included to keep me happy. Hard to come by but worth getting if you can pick it up cheap."
5,Wonderful Listen!,"The music is clear, and best of all, many of the pieces have the spoken or sung words we remember - this isn't just a CD of musical scores. It's wonderful hearing Mel Blanc's voice and reliving those Saturday mornings watching cartoons..."
2,Not very good recreations.,"I didn't think they picked any particularly good scores to recreate in the first place. There's an occasional moment where the recreation sounds exactly like the original, but overall, it sounds pretty cheesy. It wasn't like the Carl Stalling Project CDs."
1,Rape and bondage are not my cup of tea,"I knew this book was controversial before I read it, so I attempted to approach it with an open mind. Sorry folks, I just could not enjoy this story at all. Even given the medieval time frame and the heroine's plight; this story was creepy and demoralizing. Granted, some of the ""love"" scenes were hot, but they're supposed to be in a romance novel. The hero is mean spirited and I was never convinced that he loved Rowena. I have no complaints with the author's writing skills, but the whole concept of this story is one that should be passed by."
1,This is just wrong...,"I haven't been able to finish this book. By chapter 8 I couldn't believe what the heroine was going to do and by chapter 19 I had to stop reading the book...I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it. I don't understand how people find this book to be ""Johanna Lindsey's best"". Personally I don't see how rape between the hero and heroine can be romantic...there is nothing romantic about this book so far, and personally I don't know how it will turn out to be romantic in the end. If I had to rate Johanna Lindsey by this single book alone, I simply would convince anyone who reads her to stop."
2,Disappointed,"I've read every book by Johanna Lindsey and this one is perhaps one of my least favorites. I have nothing against bondage, when its done willingly. There was nothing realistic about this book and the characters were not very likeable. Torrid sex, forced or unforced, is not why I pick of a romance book, its the interplay between characters, sex should be a natural and exciting product of their relationship. What little relationship is demonstrated between the characters in this book is shallow at best and I did not find it entertaining."
5,Hot! Fun! Exciting!,This story was very HOT! If I could give it 6 stars I would. It is one of my very favorite stories. A little tie-me-tie-down - I'm all for it! If you're looking for politically correct and morally upright stories - I wouldn't recommend historical romances and definately not this! But if you like your romances spicy - this one's for you!
5,My very first romance novel,"This is the book that got me started reading Johanna Lindsey and historical romance novels.. I was embarrassed by the sex in it being I had never read anything like that before... (blushing he he) but I found the plot to be interesting (how often do you hear about a girl being forced to rape a man?).. As absurd as it may seem, she made the situation believable.If nothing else, check it out from the library and see for yourself what a great book it is.. or not.. lol"
2,Best to skip it,"This book brought back horrifying memories of Lindsey's earlier work, A Pirates Love. Not only is it not interesting, but it's hard to believe that the characters like, let alone love each other. It's not worth reading."
3,A Painful Read,"I like some of Ms. Lindsey's books, namely You Belong To Me and So Speaks The Heart.But, this one was truly a painful read, it really hurt to see how the heroine suffered at the hands of the hero. He was too cruel and in fact he was punishing an innocent person who was forced to do what she did in order to save her mother. The actual villain who was behind all this got scot free in the end. Unbelievable don't you think?Yes of course the hero finds out the truth and all his begging (not much anyway) to the heroine did not make up for all the cruel, evil, embarrassing and downright nasty things he did to her.Maybe I'm just too sensitive, I don't know but I did not enjoy this book. I am giving it a 3 star because Ms. Lindsey is a wonderful story teller and her stories come to life, even this."
4,Good but not a 5 star!,I guess my first reason for holding back on a top rating would be the subject matter - it no way offended me - how Warwick was raped at the beginning but seeing the male have that done to him just goes against what I personally enjoy in a romantic book. The way he deals with Rowena afterward however I did feel was justified and her response was intriguing. Books of this time period are not often my favorite so it takes a good writer like Lindsey to bring me into the story - and she is such an amazing writer that I often feel the depths in her books - no matter the time period. These characters were so true to the period and I loved how she was able to show a tenderness in the fierce Warwick even though he was a ruthless man of the period. Rowena was a good balance for Warwick and it was wonderful watching the love develop between these two in spite of their circumstances!
5,One of my favorites!,"Loved this book. Have read it over and over again. I loved both main character's and the story line. I think she could've stood up to her brother a little more, but overall I liked it."
4,My Opinion,"I agree with "" A good novel--for more than just the sex!"". Read that review. The Editorial Review is a little misleading. It doesn't mention the fact that Rowena is forced by her step brother in her actions from the beginning. All Lindsey's books are worth reading and rereading. I have done so many times and will continue to do so."
4,"Generally, a great book","This book had a great story line and was very entertaining as are most of Johanna Lindsey's books. However, I feel that the sex scenes were too much the center of the story. While rather over emphasized, this aspect not not detract greatly from the worth of the book. I would recommend it if you prefer Lindsey's more erotic novels."
2,Not my favorite,"I tried, really I did. I've read every Johanna Lindsey at least twice if not more, even this one...I think I've given it three chances. Yes, it does seem to grow on me after such a time BUT I still find it incredibly absurd. Granted, most of Lindseys are...and I love so many...but this one really does take the cake for being quite unbelievable. I just found the whole concept of her tying him up to 'have her way with him' and him gaining revenge in the same manner ridiculous. Not Johanna's best."
1,Romance?,"This was not romantic!!! I can't believe the good reviews this got. There is nothing romantic about rape, revenge and cruelty. The heroine did wrong, but the so called hero really went overboard punishing her. Theres no tender feelings ever revealed. Everyone else is excused and rewarded for their part in the deceit and abuse. Rowena is reviled, humiliated, and threatened with physical abuse at every turn. That is in addition to his unwanted forced sexual attacks. It's enough to make anyone swoon. How romantic!!!! REALLY! Skip this one."
1,Some Sick Stuff,"I really like Johanna Lindsey's books in general but was horrified by the content of this S&M B&D rip off. I have never put a book in the trash but that is where I put Prisoner. The ""hero"" of the book tortures a pregnant woman... holds her captive in a dungeon, subjects her to humiliation and bondage then shows her no trust or love when he professes to have fallen in love with her. The darkest thing is she takes him back and forgives all under the guise of ... Oh it only means that he loves me.... Sounds like battered Women's Syndrome to me! This is a DONT READ. Try some of her other books like savage Thunder or Angel if you want a good read."
5,Greeaatt!!!,"This is one of my faves by Johanna Lindsey. It is so refreshing to read about when a man has no rights and is at the mercy of a woman. It is not about rape, it is about being unable to refuse to do the wrong thing. The heroine has no choice. Although the story has a change of pace, she is still at the mercy of a menacing man. Her poor subject wants to refuse. He is rightfully upset and pissed that she would have the gall to rape him, but you can't really rape the willing. His mind says no but his body does not agree. Without that, there would be no taking of his manhood. In the end he has the upper hand. That doesn't happen in the other novels when the woman is the victim. The woman has to win him over. This book was a great departrure for the norm with historicals. Thank you Jo-Lin."
5,"Worth It, Far better Writing than Most in the Genre","Gripping, well-written story with characters you will have an emotional reaction to, and with whom you will feel a connection. A joy to have intelligent characters, with smart, believable dialogue and consistent personalities. Romance writing is fraught with predictable scenarios and shallow characters, but this one delivers a dynamic tale and a realistic relationship between the heroin and hero that evolves despite the sex, not because of it. Both Warrick and Rowena could step out of that book and be real people. Great read, thanks Johanna Lindsey."
2,dual water timer,timer worked great for about 30 days just past the return policy deadline. now the timer has a mind of its own. It has 6 cycles and the last one does not turn off most of the time and we have turn off the water manually defeating the purpose of a digital timer
1,Its Only works on manual mode ?,"I dont know why my timer doesnt work automatically . although i read the manual instruction many many times and it was so easy and simple , so i have 3 differnet programming times ,i got nothing no watering at all ? its only working on manual mode !!!MONEY WASTE.I HAVE TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE???"
2,How could a timer be so hard to use?,"I was very disappointed in this considering how expensive it was. One of the outlets didn't work with the timer at all. I found the set-up crazy difficult - it didn't make any sense. I did get it to work finally but I found the ""Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer"" a much better timer at a much lower cost"
4,works as expected,"While the instructions and the setup were a bit wacky (see other reviews), I had no problems getting it to work just fine for my small space. I didn't have any problems with the device until winter. I thought nothing of it, but just removed the battery since i knew it wouldn't be used and turned the water off completely. Unfortunately, this summer when I started it again the housing had a small crack (enough to spray water). So be sure to remove the timer completely and bring it in doors during the winter. Seems obvious now, but I have to order another one now."
5,Claber Water timer,This is the best timer I have used in years. It is simple to use and set up and the manual options make it easy to run also. I have opted this method over an inground sprinkler and now the neighbors are doing the same.
1,Money and Time Wasted,"I purchased my second Duplo in May, 2010. The first one lasted 2 years and started leaking around the housing. Within two weeks of use, Station A failed to close twice. The second time, I was out of town and my yard was flooded when I got home (Had to shut it off manually). I called Debra at Claber, she said problems with Duplo was rare and after making sure that I was operating the unit correctly, she asked me to send the unit back for testing. I just received the unit back from Claber after almost 4 weeks. They attached a note saying 'Test Good'. I was hoping they will at least replace the Station A Shut-Off Valve. I don't think I can trust it enough to use it again. Should had just gone to Home Depot and bought the Orbit Timer in the first place!"
1,Very complicated setup,"This product looked great and seemed to be exactly what I needed. However, the setup programming is perhaps the most tedious pain in the rear. I am returning and going for an alternative product."
4,Good timer.,"Very well made and reliable timer. I run two micro-sprinkler systems on this timer, one at 50 psi and one at 30 psi. They can not be set to run at the same time, but I set the second to run immediately after the first stops. They are set to run every third day. The timers were used for three months last year with no problems. I removed the timer for the winter and stored it out of the weather. I can find no fault with the timer other than it is bright orange. Equipment in landscaping should not be a focal point."
4,Worth the cost,"I had a little trouble programming the unit, but it was easy after a little practice. Looks like it should last a long time for me because I only need it for a couple weeks per year. I tested it before I went on vacation and it was completely reliable."
1,DO NOT ORDER,"I order two of these, one for the backyard and one for the front yard. Both have shorted out, meaning they would come on and would never turn off. Which happened to be a weekend I went out of town and caused my water bill to be sky high. I decide to test it to see what was going on and the same thing happen and the screen would just be flashing everything on the screen. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,"Good idea, REALL silly programming","Okay, besides having to pull the battery and try and get the thing to die so that we could start again (they say 15 mins w/o battery - more like 2 hours+) - the buttons DO NOT always activate the programming. Why is it that they want this watering device to have - hold on to your hats - over 30 programming times possible? And why does it refuse to allow you to turn on at, say, 10pm and turn off at 1am? Nope, everything has to be done up to midnight.Eventually got it working - two pipes, each one once a day for 3 hours (95% of all users will want this type of simple programming) - push the buttons a total of 124 times to achieve this!And then there is this little piece of advice: make sue it is in the shade... direct sunlight overheats it and it fails."
2,"Deceiving ""dual timer""","I purchased two units of this ""dual timer"" since its review was good. Since I was busy, I didn't open the box and used it until many months after I received them. Until I installed them and then I realized that this 'dual timer' can't have different time settings - for example I want one outlet to be on once every 3 days and another one every 7 days. The timer cannot do that - the two outlets have to be on on the same day. That pretty much makes this timer useless to me! I wish I had read a review telling that before I made the purchase. This timer definitely not worthy its price. Very disappointed!"
4,Claber 8410 Aquadue Duplo Dual-Outlet Digital Water Timer,"Works excellent, nice built quality, but cumbersome settings. Would give 5 stars otherwise. Bought two and like it so far."
1,Claber 8410 Aquadue Digital water timer,"Terrible unit do not waste money. Set timing sequence by direction had a mind of its own would go off any time it wanted. My wife and I take pride in setting up any digital device, and we finnaly gave up, bought from Amazon last year for newly seeded lawn. Like to have my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT"
4,claber dual hose timer,"I have previously purchased 4 of these things for a home we have in the mountains. The original purchase 3 or 4 yrs. ago gave up the ghost last summer and I am now replacing it with 2 additional timers. When these things work, they work flawlessly but when the display has been exposed to direct sun light the digital read out is impossible to discern and the life of the unit is short. Still cheaper than installing an underground system for the three months it is used."
3,Ok,"Heavy duty, obviously high quality. However, programming is pretty wacky. For example, the instructions and some menu options refer to the 2 outputs as ""A"" and ""B"". Some refer to them as ""1"" and ""2"". They even have it printed on the face of the unit, i.e. A = 1, B = 2. This gets very confusing as you also have multiple numbered programs. Another very frustrating thing is that if you use the weekly program, which is the one where you can specify the days to water (not sure how that equals ""weekly"") you must run the specified programs for each zone. In other words, it's not possible to water zone A on Monday and zone B on Tuesday. Not a huge deal, I water zone A at 5:00 AM and zone B at 6:00, but I would have liked to water both at 5:00 on different days. Not sure how this compares to other brands, but if this is representative, these guys need to hire a human interfaces consultant. It would be very easy to create a better interface"
4,VERY useful,"Living in a very hot, dry climate makes taking time away from home during the summer a risk to my landscaping. After a terrible experience hiring someone to install drip irrigation last summer while I was gone and coming home to a backyard mess, I decided that this year I would go with my own much cheeaper make-shift plan. I got some rotating sprinklers, some short hoses to connect them and this water timer. I couldn't believe how well this water timer works! It took me a little while to get the hang of setting the timer, but once I did it was a breeze. Works as good as the installed sprinkler system in my front yard, yet was much cheaper."
3,Pentax Optio A10,"First the good: very compact, very user-friendly operation, very good for interior shots. It also looks very nice, and will take several hundred pictures with a 1GB SD card (about 450 at a little over 2MB per picture).Now the bad: hard to get ""that moment"" when taking candid shots of people, especially children, because of the delay noted by other reviewers.And the really, really bad: virtually impossible to see the screen when taking outdoor shots during the day, because of reflection. There does not seem to be any solution to this problem, other than carrying a dark-cloth with you (like the old photographers used to use a hundred years ago). At least my (bulkier) Olympus cameras have an eye-level viewfinder so you can compose outdoor shots. Maybe there's a market for an add-on magnifier cowl like Hasselblad used to sell (for about twice the price of a Nikon)."
5,Excellent Camera,"Size, price and quality, this camera still competes sucessfully with it's newer siblings.I am exetremely satisfied with the Pentax Optio A10. No problems found to report."
1,DO NOT BUY ! - Pentax A10,"I owned this camera for less than one year. In spite of keeping the camera in a hardshell case and NEVER dropping it, abusing it, etc...the LCD screen cracked. Upon sending it in for repair, it categorically declared ""uncovered"" by the warranty. My efforts to reason with the service department at Pentax were a waste of time.I have owned many cameras, most of them being a Canon. This was my first Pentax...and the last."
4,"Great value, minor nuances","Great value; dependable product. Shake reduction causes longer delay in snapping the shutter, but can be easily turned off if it's bothersome. No direct viewfinder, like on other Pentax cameras, so the LCD screen must be used to frame the shot. Nice, new recharge tray makes it easy to charge battery...now, if they just combined it with a computer USB port for downloading, that would be great!"
5,Excellent camera and excellent price,"I actually paid $360 for this camera and it was worth every penny. I LOVE the shake resistant feature. I have a new grandson and he just doesn't sit still, but I never get a bad picture. It's a really small, light weight camera but quite rugged, so I can carry it in my purse all the time. The pictures are really good. I print 8x10s all the time and they are as good as print film photos, even when I do some cropping. The view screen is nice and large so I enjoy showing off my photos to friends, through the camera. I've owned several Pentax cameras and had great luck with all of them. The customer service has been real good too. I like this one so much I'm giving it to my daughter and getting the 10MP version for myself. At this new, lower price... there just isn't another camera out there that can match this quality and features."
4,"The ""pre-flash"" is extremely annoying. Otherwise it's fun.","The camera has a ""pre-flash"" before the real flash. which adds a full second between the instant you press the button and the time the picture is actually taken.That might not sound like much, but it's enough for you to miss that cute pose your kid HAD, a second ago... when you actually wanted the picture. You can get a kid to look at the camera for a split second, then the first flash pops, one full second later, the picture actually takes. Meanwhile your kid is a blur in the lens.It's not a ""red-eye reduction"" flash, altought the camera has that feature (even longer pause between 2 flashes). And it can't be turned off, short of turning off the flash altogether.Either I need a camera that takes the picture closer to when the button is pressed, or I need more patient kids."
2,Nice Features BUT FAULTY CCD sensor,"I really like this Camera, HOWEVER, the CCD had a dead spot on it from Day one, it's visible in the same place on all darkish pictures/video as a bright white pixel visible on all media, whether it's the camera's LCD, viewed on a PC screen, a TV or even prints. VERY annoying.I am still waiting for feedback from Pentax after a week. WHEN YOU RECIEVE YOUR CAMERA CHECK FOR THIS RIGHT AWAY - if you order one of course.DissapointedBrett"
1,pentex = junk,"Nothing but problems with this camera, customer service is horrible. One word of advise don't buy this peace of junk! They even charged me to repair a defect! I'm going to file a complaint with the consumer protection agency."
2,Not that great,"This camera is ok, but not great.It takes sooo long from the time of the flash to the actual time of the picture, your subject has already moved and you miss that great shot!!I took the camera to Walt Disney World and out of 3500-4000 photos only 10 or so were good shots and those were of things that didnt move!! (like the castle) The shots that you actually get are good quality but I like to take a lot of pic's and I dont have time to waste with making sure everyone stands still for 2-3 seconds (or more) after the flash!I am saving money right now to buy the Canon EOS Rebel XTi. It will take 8-10 pic's in the same time as the Pentax A10's 1."
4,Pentax Optio A10,"Camera as described. Very satisfied. Only draw back, no view finder, but most other cameras this size don't have view finders either. Takes great pictures."
4,my husband loves this band,I bought this for my husband. It was really cheap and it came in great condition. like brand new. i think this group only made one cd.my husband loves this band and wore out his first cd. they have there own kind of sound. they are like honeymoon suite without the keyboards.anyway if you are looking for something differnt give them a try. it is too bad they didn't stay together.
1,DISSAPOINTING MUSIC DVD,A VERY DISSAPOINTING DVD...POOR QUALITY PICTURE AND LIVE SOUND .THENEW LADIES ...KATIE MATEA AND OTHERS ..EH ? NEW LADIES ?
2,hope you like italian,"Give it a 2 star only because box says english and italian mono but only italian language is available, and there is no way to bring up any other language Does have english subtitles."
2,Ma Rules,"Ma Rules looks to be a good CD, but it's not. The only song worth listening to is the second track, ""Aiwa"". I am very dissapointed with Darine's new album."
5,"Great, Soft Work Boot","I got these on my first day from my company and after getting some tall work socks, these are great boots. I am not the only one with these and some of my coworkers have had theirs for years. The leather is soft, the footing is firm and you can tell they are built to last.I get new boots every two years, but I have a feeling that I will keep these around for years to come. The price may seem a little steep, but you truly get what you pay for and these will be well worth the price."
5,The Bird is the Word,"If you enjoy parrots- if you enjoy parrots dressed up in tiny outfits reenacting historical and hysterical scenes by an eccentric but loving owner,you will enjoy this book. Both Mrs. Ballard and her birds seem to be having a wonderful time and it's a joy to behold. Thanks, Arne Svenson, for making these photos available to the world in this pictorially rich book!"
5,A wonderful book about an incredible woman . . .,"Mrs. Ballard's Parrots by Arne Svenson is a picture book that will appeal to all ages. Alba Ballard, a Long Island housewife,created costumes to dress up her pet parrots and cockatoos. She also designed colorful and realistic sets and props to display the costumed birds.Although the book is now out of print, I urge you to get a copy of this fascinating book.JCH"
5,unique book,"BATMAN, ROBIN, SONY, CHER,PATTON, LIBERACE & LITTLE REDRIDING HOOD.Never in my life have I seen any thinglike this book. It is just amazing. I have4 parrots and I can promise you whatAlba Ballard did was not easy.My parrots would NEVER let me dressthem or pose them. It just shows youhow much they LOVED her.This is not just a book of pictures. Thereis a sweet lovely story to go along withthe photos.THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR PARROTLOVERS. A MUST FOR ANIMAL LOVERS.YOU HAVE TO SEE THESE PICTURES TOBELIEVE THEM.This book is a keepsake."
4,Great book if you're interested in showing your Boxer,"The book is well written in British english and offers comprehensive information about the breed. If you are interested in showing your Boxer, this is THE book for you! Approximately 70% of the content is in regards to preparing, rearing and showing a championship Boxer. Great pictures display a complete range of gorgeous, beautiful boxers from fawn to brindle, cropped & floppy ears, of all ages and physiques."
3,Best bang for the buck.......,This set of vintage war newsreels and cheaply made documentaries may not be for everybody but you get a staggering 50 hours of informative footage for a little over 20 bucks. My strongest critique is the editing of the film footage from b&w into a sepia color tone. Great gift idea........
4,Interesting food,"The recipes in the book are very interesting and a good change from the bland food usually given to babies. I am Asian and I eat a lot of spicy food. This book has given me a way to introduce my baby to the kind of food we eat at home, like curries for example."
1,Against medical advice!,"As a practicing family physician, with a spouse who is a nurse, I was shocked at the advice given in this book. Many of the recommended dietary additions go completely against the accepted standards of the American Academy of Pediatrics. For example, whole milk and cottage cheese are recommended by the authors at a far too early age. I returned it immediately and would not recommend it."
1,The recipes are not for an everyday mom like me!,"I found that in order to create some of the recipes listed in the book I would have to make a special trip to the market. I found the recipes eccentric and not at all what I was looking for. I was expecting a book that contained healthy, easy recipes for an everyday mom like me!"
5,Suprising & Fantastic!,"Perfect upbeat, grooving tunes, with a basic guitar-piano-bass-drums... none of it is too flavored to sound dated. I originally heard these guys on The Partridge Family and enjoyed the song they did; so I bought the album that they sang for when they were 13. Then I saw this CD for 18 cents... but I listened to the samples here and coughed up the 18 cents and shipping. Honestly, I cannot believe how good this album is, really. It's too mature, too sensitive, too soulful, and too honest.. without feeling like they're being preachy... its too much of all those things for a commercial market; makes me sad. Buy this if you want to hear great upbeat / grooving music that makes you feel tenderness. Several songs really move me emotionally."
5,Sure is great to see this 'rarity' available again,"I have had the vinyl since it's initial release and was lucky enough to find a copy of the CD (on A&M) in a $1.99 bin some time ago. Driving away from Home(especially the remix) is great driving (no pun intended) music. One of those many albums that you probably never knew existed unless you were in the right place (ie NYC) at the right time ('80s). Highly recommended as is the 2nd (& apparently out of print) ""SONG"""
3,Ripped Off,"Was so excited, started watching, one Season Quality wasn't very good, the rest were great, until we got to Season 12... TOTALLY MISSING FROM PACKAGE. Too late to complain 8 months later (takes a long time to get there). Of course, didn't notice at the startsince they are all bound together and who'd of thought we HAD to check..... oh well, our bad!!!! BE FORWARNED!Dallas: Seasons 1-12"
5,A remix CD like no other,"I had never heard of Madredeus before stumbling upon this album of Electronica remixes. While expecting the usual Hard Dance-floor Beat remixes, I was stunned to hear down-tempo, chilled-out, electronic beats by some of my favorite musicians (Dusted, Craig Armstrong, Alpha). The others seemed to work in the same vein, which is fine by me. If you like laid-back, chilled out or trip-hop music with ethereal vocals, this CD is hard to beat. Rarely do I find A CD that I am totally happy with, but this is a keeper and a solid alternative to the usual run of the mill ""Chillout"" compilation."
1,The Worst of Madredeus,"I absolutely love Madredeus, so of course as soon as their new album came out I bought it sight unseen. Boy was I ever disappointed when I got it home. The whole foundation of Madredeus, that they have nurtured over the years, is their unique acoustic style and old-world charm. In this album, that history comes tumbling down in a cacophony of clips and snips of noise. The succulent voice of Teresa Salgueiro is savagely mutilated by a lifeless machine, and all that remains of the beauty of this group is their name, which in my eyes is now woefully tarnished. If you love Madredeus, do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS CD! Perhaps the poor sales will send them a message to never do this again."
3,Prove your love.,"In a moment of weakness, Marissa Madison and Adam Pierce tumbled into bed together. For Marissa, it was love. For Adam, it was depression and too much alcohol. Three months later, they meet again when Marissa must tell him she's pregnant. Adam is shocked, but soon tries to take over her life. It isn't long before Adam wants Marissa in his life forever.Adam's growth and Marissa's doubts are well done. The reasons behind Marissa's insecurities are also well-defined. A good story."
4,New Teen Sensation,"Mandy Moore is a great new teen singer. She has slow songs(Walk Me Home) and fast up beat songs(So Real, Lock me in your heart). Mandy Moore's debut album is really good. I really love it."
1,Uugggghhhhhh........,"Yuck! Okay, so 'Candy' was kinda catchy. Big deal! Mandy Moore can't sing worth anything and I'd take Christina Agulera's music over her any day!"
4,Treat to luxury,These sheets are great. When money is of concern but you want something nice for yourself - buy these sheets.
3,"Not his best, but still a keeper","I have become a big Jim Lauderdale fan over the past decade, due in great part to his collabortion with Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter. This is early Lauderdale, though, and not indicative of his more current material. Still, it's worth the price and well worth listening to."
4,this was a tight Jam a few years back,not a fan of His Stuff overall but a Song like this you can bop your head to&it rocks in a club.I give DMX this Cut.
4,The Way To Get A Party Started,"If there is one song that you can guarentee to get the crowd up and on the dance floor, it is this song. Nearly 5 years later and it is still one of the best club songs out there. The lyrics might be a bit explicit, but if you can get the edited or even the instrumental version, you will be straight for a start to a wild night."
5,The Coasters: Searchin,"Music like this is very difficult to find, i love being able to buy it from amazons web site, instant downloads once purchase clears, and the quality is super.Thank you"
5,Henry Fonda's finest,I saw this movie years ago. It's still fresh in my memory. An elderly couple returns to the beach they have loved all their lives. Joyful and sad memories come flooding back. This movie was so tender and sweet. It will stay with you forever.
2,Great Cookies- But close to expiration date,"I ordered the Chocolate & Mint variety. Amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly. However, I ordered the cookies in early November, and they arrived with a ""Best When Used By"" date of December 4, 2006. They will expire less than a month after they arrived!I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault or not. The cookies are shipped in the manufacturer's Back to Nature box, so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on Amazon.com."
1,never received item,I ordered this tee shirt and never received it. I have not been extended the courtesy of an e-mail or telephone call. enough said!
2,kindle fire editiion review,Do not buy the electronic version of this. There is no navigation at all so finding any topic takesforever. The search feature is useless because it takes forever. What a shame.
1,Prepare to work!,"This product is listed under ""ankle percussion"", and as such it is completely disfunctional. There is no opening to allow you to actually put it on your ankles. The fabric is too soft for the heavy rattles and the original sewing job is poor. I had to figure out how to make it work. Had to purchase valcrow first thing. Luckily, I owe a sewing machine, but even with that I spent 2 additional hours sewing by hand to make it somewhat work. All that instead of just happilly handing it to my friend on time as a holiday gift. So if you are inventive, have extra time to spare and can afford to waste money, I highly recommend this product."
4,Healthy Food,"Being a person with Type 2 diabetes, I have to eat whole grains. Finding a flavorful whole wheat couscous is a boon. This couscous does not taste like cardboard."
1,disappointed,"Was looking forward to lovely whole wheat looking and tasting couscous, and got the same white bland tasting stuff I can buy at the local store for a whole lot less money."
1,"Good Story, Badly Written","An avid reader, it took me nearly a month to finish this story. Boredom set in every time I picked it up. I felt Kay was not a sympathetic character, I found her to be a very weak minded character. This abuse began before her marriage, and there was no one holding a gun to her head to marry him. She had money, family and friends who would have supported her in not marrying him.The actual story takes what seems like years to get to. Too wordy and drawn out. The entire story could have been told in about 50 pages...however this story didn't even become remotely interesting until about page 50.As a Criminal Justice major and advocate for battered women, I've never encountered a woman so non-assertive. If you'd like to rewrite the story, I'd love to help you by making it interesting."
3,Decent,"This was a pretty good CD, though a bit strange. The best track is certainly the instrumental. Hard to find, but good."
3,Pretty Good,this album has some moments but this album doesn't hold up as strong as Blues on the Bayou.the album with Clapton is Better.the Album has alot of Formula GOing On.He is Still A Great TALent Despite the SHortcomings of this Disc.
3,a dissenting view,"I love B.B. King's work. I listen to it almost every day. But I was disappointed in this album. Unlike ""Blues on the Bayou"" and some of his other recent albums, ""Makin Love Is Good For You"" is tired. The blues is not always high energy, adrenalin heavy. But this album's material is not first class and the performances reflects it. It sounds like it was done late in a long tour. I hope his new album, coming out next month, is better. He is still the King."
2,Not a fan of the arrangements,"As pointed out by another reviewer there is a lot of use of the thumb hooking over the top of the guitar. If your hand isn't big enough or your guitar has a wide/thick neck, you will have to end up rewriting the fingering for almost every tune. Actually even when the thumb isn't used, I'm still not a big fan of the suggested fingerings."
5,A must have for everyone!,"Wonderful! Even if you never grew up in Eastern Kentucky as I did, you'll feel as if you had. Great poetry. Also, the artwork of Tom Whitaker is great also. A must have for every bookshelf."
5,A very good adventure compliation,The adventures described all tie in to form a bigger plot and all of them have a different feel to them. From mystery solving to standard hacking and slashing. The adventure name is a turn off but once you get past it it shows itself to be a good adventure. The one problem it has is that it seems overly generous with its magical items. Some descretion needed
1,Careful: DTS does not play on standard CD players,"This is in DTS format. It won't play on my computers or on my CD players; nor can I rip it to MP3 format because, evidently, my computer can't read DTS format. I had this album on vinyl and liked it, by the way."
1,DTS doesn't mean quad,I agree with Mario Yrun's excellent review. This DTS CD is much worse than the original stereo LP. ....
1,Misrepresentation,This item has been wrongly labeled as a paperback book. It should be better labeled as a map. And as a map it is extremely overpriced. The contents are in very small print which means that it is difficult to read The pictures themselves look like they were done on the cheap. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I was not amused when I received this item in the mail.
2,"A map, NOT a book","I also felt misled by the way this map was marketed. As a map, it is probably a good one as some of the reviewers that used it indicated. It is NOT a book. It is priced like one and I feel ripped-off. When it came, I couldn't even remember ordering something like it and couldn't understand why I would have paid such an exorbitant price for a map. Coming back to the Amazon site to research how this error occurred, I realized that the error was not on my part. I paid for a BOOK because it was presented as such. I got a MAP, not the sales pitch that was given for the product. A product may be good, but if it is misrepresented, you feel that you have been sold a bill of goods. It is not a guide as one thinks of guides, but rather a tourist map."
1,Michael Brein's Guide to Honolulu & Oahu By the Bus,What a waste of money! I was expecting some information to help traverse the island by public transportation and all this guide did was show a map.Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You get more information off the Internet.
5,Absolutely The Best!,"Simply, the research team covers everything from much needed basic history to indepth discussion in a conversational tone.Great attention is given to documentation of facts. Written for all to enjoy, from the novice to the advanced scholar.A literary masterpiece. MUST read!!"
1,Poor Design,"I purchased one of these regulators when I installed a new compressor. It lasted about 9 months and then the inadequate plastic design simply failed. If you use one of these regulators, you can't leave any pressure on the plastic housing inards (when not in use) because it will fatigue and then shatter apart. I found pieces spread all over my garage where the compressor is installed. And when it breaks, the spring, etc from inside the knob go flying all over the place. There are many other reviews else-where that describe the same situation. This regulator should not be sold until the design is corrected.If you look at the plastic threaded ring, as you can see in the picture, it does nothing. I am not sure but maybe its suppose to have a lip that helps to hold the knob base to the metal housing, but the design doesn't permit that. The result is the internal spring constantly puts pressure on a plastic part that can not bear the stress over any length of time, then it breaks."
1,Cheap Cheap,"This is actually a Kobalt 221016 3/8(or is it campbell making kobalt... whatever)I've gone through a couple now (I was swapping out parts)but I'm going to have to bite the bullet and tear my air plumbingapart and put in something decent.One exploded - one leaked - two fracturedI'm going to try the Ingersoll Rand R37231-600-VSUpdate: The photo changes depending on the day of the week I guess.I reviewed the H7273, but today the photo is of the mini-regulator.Probably be something different tomorrow."
5,Great music for romantic nights!,"A very carefully crafted 2 CD set of smooth jazz and new age music. This is a very melodic set that flows very nicely. You can read a book while this is on, or use it for entertaining. Great to listen while eating dinner! I was very impressed! Would highly recommend!"
2,Live Beautiful Day,"Couple good renditions but pretty poor sonics and a number of forgettable tunes. Their studio album ""It's a Beautiful Day"" remains the one to own."
4,good tire,Not much to say.Rolls niceonly have about 30 miles on them so far no flats.A bit wider then i thought they would be. but its a smooth ride. I'm 6'2 270 so tires take a beating with me.
3,"Decent cheap tires, but beware of city riding","These tires are cheap and decent. They serve their purpose, but do not last long. I had my pair for a year with only city riding. The tread was still fine, but they just ended up allowing so many flats that it got to annoying. At the end I would have about one to two flats a week. I finally decided to retire these guys and coughed up the money for gatorskins. I have never looked back. I am sure these tires would be fine on trails with no glass, potholes, or branches. But if you are riding on city streets it best to avoid these tires."
2,First tire didn't hold up well,"I bought two of these on the strength of the Michelin name. After a few weeks, about 60 miles, the first tire had lots of damage from Chicago road debris. Granted, Chicago streets seem paved with broken glass, but the Kenda's that came on the bike did well for a year. I switched the first tire out for the second one, which seems to be doing okay after the same number of miles. At least no flats yet, knock on wood."
1,poor tire,"Don't waste your time. Other tires will get me 1500 miles. This one, I almost got to 200 before flats became an ongoing issue."
1,Horrible Tires!,I have replaced 6 tubes in 3 months. These tires puncture very easily. I would not buy these tires ever again. GARBAGE
2,Not too thrilled...,"Michelin Dynamic 700cx23 came with the bike. Took the bike to the bike shop for pro adjustment. Took it for a ride, and in the first 4 1/2 miles experienced a front flat. Wasn't too happy but thought could happen to anyone. Replaced it, checked the tire for foreign objects which I couldn't find, inspected the tire on the outside and didn't see punctures, put a new tube, got home. Within two days I had another flat on the front wheel, 21 miles total. Took appart everything, triple inspected everything, no visible puncture, nothing inside of the tire. Tube was punctured on a different spot this time. Overall not too happy with the tire. After the second incident I didn't have any problems yet, it's been about 50-70 miles later. I am not sure if tubes were bad, Kenda tubes, I used these before without many issues. If I don't have any more problems I might consider this tire again, but if this keeps on happening I am switching."
5,Outstanding durability,"I rode 2300 road miles on a set of Michelin Dynamic 700/28Cs before the first puncture, so I was definitely due one! When properly maintained (i.e. correctly fitted and not over inflated) these are excellent tyres with durability that puts several other manufacturers products to shame."
2,Not a Good Value,This is a decent low-end tire. One should only pay low-end prices for such. Learn from my most unfortunate mistake.
5,SMALL BUT POWERFUL,SMALL BUT POWERFUL without the expense. Great for my computer and the music really sounds so good now from it. Movies sound so much better with this hooked up to my computer. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY NETFLIX CUSTOMER!!
2,"Waste of Money, Don't buy this.","I was looking for the cheapest computer speakers I could find, turned out to be a huge mistake. There's bad static and white noise when I listen through headphones. I tried different earphones and it most definitely was coming from the speakers. Also, there's bad static when it's near a cell phone or a radio. It's not worth the shipping charge even to return it to the store. Cyber Acoustics sounded familiar, but now I know not to buy their products ever again."
1,Do Not Get These,The quality of this sound product is TERRIBLE!!! The bass speaker might as well not even be attached because the first volume level pretty much blows it out. I would rather not have sound than use these speakers.
3,Not the worst,"Obviously for the price i paid i wasn't expecting much. I like to have music outside when i bbq and stuff so that's the main reason i bought it but this is not ideal for much else. It shows in the instruction manual how it can be used with a gaming system but honestly i wouldn't even think to try it unless it was an older system like an old nintendo, nintendo 64, or psone"
1,Electronics Poor,Just after the warranted expired the bass quit working. I didnt expect much from these speakers but I did expect them to work for more than a couple of months. Id pass on these and spend a bit more
2,Buyer beware!,"This is the second set of Cyber Acoustics speakers I've purchased and I eventually had the same problem with both: There was a loose connection in one of the speakers and the speaker went out, leaving just one working speaker. Again, this happened with both sets that I've purchased, including this one. It's a shame because the speakers have good sound and they're relatively inexpensive. But what good are they when, a few months down the road, you don't get any sound?Also, you'll be disappointed with the craftsmanship of the speakers for this particular unit. They're very dinky: small and very light. On the other hand, the sound and the subwoofer are pretty good."
2,Meh.,"After reading a number of the reviews here, I figured I would try these speakers in effort to get a decent bang for my buck. I was disappointed with the sound quality. Unless you use speakers for little more than your computers system sounds or listening to music very quietly, I would get something else. The biggest detraction is that without the sub-woofer connected, the desktop speakers sound like poop. Tin poop. The sound is noticeably better with the sub-woofer but the system as a whole never generated quality sound. And what happens in the event that the sub-woofer stops working after the warranty expires. I'd be stuck with tin poop. I can't bring myself to listen to music, or watch films with these speakers. I am returning them and planning to cough up a few more dollars for better sound."
4,Solid,"This is my first review, and I didn't even buy it, my wife did. I am a sound snob, and this little system was really great. Not the greatest piece of audio equipment ever, but the fact I see it on here for under $20 bucks is ridiculous. If that is your budget, buy this, I don't think you will be disappointed. Solid bottom end, weak midrange, reasonable highs. Cannot expect more than that for under twenty bucks."
2,"Muddy Sound, Would Not Choose Again","I wanted the cheapest speakers I could get that would sound good. These have good bass, but that's about it. Everything sounds muddy and unclear. I should have gone with a set that didn't have a subwoofer for that same price."
4,nice,nice for the money..i use these at work while i listed to music. i wanted something with a little bass and this helps a lot for the price.
3,Ok alone...Replace Sub with something else,"I own this set, and am not very impressed with the sub that it came with. It's ok for its size, but could be better. I wired the sub output on the back of the right speaker to a JBL TLX-171 floor speaker (tweeter, midrange and eight inch sub that retails for around $200) and the sound was absolutely incredible, and insanely powerful. You could hear it from the house next door!These are great for a small [home] office area. I would recommend them for computer use, as there isn't very much bass coming out of the little sub if you are using them for music only. They make a great amplifier if you hook up a larger sub."
5,Soft and loveable,"My 3 year old daughter wanted an alligator for Christmas. I am so glad that I purchased this one. She loved it! She sleeps with it every night. It's a good size, and nice and soft. She just loves it!"
1,Psychiatry Student Note-Book,"Knowing the practical outcomes from a mix of mere lies and paranoiac delusions like ""Syphilis [in then Germany] is on rise because aristocrats merry ugly Jewish women and look around to fulfill natural urges, de-facto supporting and increasing prostitution"",is just wondering at a kind of then European/USSR rulers taking this clearly mentally-disturbed writer as their ally.Hopefully, something had changed in diplomacy and politics since then."
5,Good purchase,These speakers are great. They have very good sound and can be used for any portable device. Nonrechargeable batteries and carry-on bag included.I tested them with a PSP and iPod and I'm very satisfied with the sound. The cable is long enough to separate the speakers apart. I wish the base were more stable but all in all it's a pretty good purchase.
3,good but nothing profound,"The author begins the book writing about his time as a physics graduate student at Columbia. From there, he reflects on his growing cynicism regarding physics as a profession. Ultimately, he takes us into the early days of the technical bond value determination.It's pretty technical at times, which is needed given the subject material. The personal anecdotes are pretty far and few between, but is good seasoning for an otherwise dense dish."
3,Kind of Boring,"Possibly this book was too complex and over my head. I am not an expert on finance or physics. I find both topics in their own right interesting, but I don't know how well they mix together. I read the book as I enjoy reading about finance and trying to understand the principles better.I was able to get through about 75 pages, and then found myself really drifting and not picking up too much beyond the first couple of chapters. For readers who are exploring this field they may find the book more interesting and will certainly understand the topics, but to the layperson the book will be too dry.In short, the book is not poorly written, but I had to fight too much to get through the first 75 pages and skimmed from there. Not too many takeaways from this one and I don't think it will be listed as a top book or a must have anywhere."
2,Boring and repetetive,"Very (very) shallow on technical content. Bizarre and boring anecdotes about the politics of the big investment banks. Detailed stories about uninteresting aspects of the author's life. I kept looking for some real beef, but gave up at some point."
5,A must read for every Financial Engineer,finished reading in one day! learned a lot of background of these classic financial models.
1,Average person living pretty average life,"No offense to the author, but his career doesn't deserve being in a book.Like most of us, Dr.Derman is an average person living an average life. I do not know what motivated him to write about his life in fine details. To be honest, I bought this book to read about Quants, how they predict stock and market trends, create and test sophisticated computer models, fail and succeed, etc. The book isn't really about it.The first half of the book is just about becoming a physicist and, eventually, failing at being a physicist.The second part is about working at different financial institutions and trying to understand what is going on...Again, I am upset that I was ""forced"" to read about this nice but pretty average person living some pretty average life for 120+ pages and actually paid for it...If you want to learn about Quants, go buy some other book."
3,Not much for reflexions,"The book is rather interesting, but it is generally anecdotal : ""I've done this, I've done that"". There is not much perspective nor reflection on the ""Quants"" phenomenon."
4,Good Book,"This book was interesting to anyone interested in finance, economics, mathematics, physics or the interesection of these fields. My only complaint is that it began to drag near the end. It is an interesting auto-biography. Its worth reading if you are considering a career in finance."
4,Admirable,"This books is really great on many levels. First, if you would like to know more about Black-Scholes formula, options pricing, bond pricing or refresh the knowledge you have, Derman lays it out for you in very plain and easily digestable language. Second, you enjoy reading brutally honest, entertaining and insightful accounts of amazing peoples lives, this if one of the best.After reading it I found myself admiring the professional courage Derman has shown all his life, as well as his refreshing direct and honest way of describing both his strengths and weaknesses."
3,Not the best Marseille deck for the money,"There are many Marseille decks in print. In this edition, the cards are reproduced exactly, without enhancement, and retain their original signs of wear and use. A shiny, new, plastic coated deck that tries to look old just looks out of place. The Marseille deck printed by Piatnik retains the flavor of the early decks but is enhanced to remove wear and tear. The Marseill deck printed by Fournier predates the Lo Scarabeo deck by 30 years (1734) and has better colors."
5,"Charming, fun, and touching!","I'm a little biased, but I love this movie. Katherine Nelson's voice is amazing, and so is Dan Beck's. The characters are fun, the lesson is important, and it's very entertaining!"
5,nice boots,The boots are nice and fit great. I found them to be true to the size. The heel is the right hieght for wearing every day.
5,Very informative and extremely easy to read,"If you are thinking of learning about philosophy in general would recommend this book as a good introduction to the beliefs of the 18th century French movement. If you are interested in Voltaire I would tell you to read this book AND NO OTHER. I have flipped through and read parts of other books and a great many of the boring, extremely boring. This book, especially the short introduction, are extremely exciting and bring the beliefs of Voltaire into sharp clarity. It includes his Philosophical Dictionary, the Candide, and several of his essays and plays. It also has a history of his life and what happened to him due to his heretical views."
5,Voltaire is God!!,"I had heard of Voltaire being one of the greatest critics, satirists and philosophers of the Age of Reason; Now I see why. He tore apart many of the myths religions used to justify promoting *their* religion as the right one while bashing those others. He points out that a religion claiming to be free of superstitions and claiming to be against the same is hypocritical if it still sees Satan as effecting in ""bad"" behavior and similar un-Christian things. He points out that there is no such thing as going against one's will; If one does, one is simply adhering to the demands of another will, a will to do something different, and hence going against will when given choice is impossible. Read this book; It will inspire, educate and enlighten you!"
5,"Best Volume of the ""Old sinner from the eighteenth century""","The portable Voltaire is the best single volume representing all his works. You don't just get the finest short novel ever written (Candide), you get Zadig, Micromegas, selections from the Philisophical Dictionary, Letters from England, and more.This is the volume to get if you want to find out why that weird looking character was always smiling..."
5,Lady Dragon 2,"I think that this is one of the most awesome and climatic Lady Dragon movies I have ever seen. Cynthia Rothrock returns and this time she gets some serious revenge. Three men who steal a whole bag of diamonds, decide to stash them or smuggle them on a soccer player and martial arts couple's luggage at the airport and the female doesn't even know about it. When they unpack from a trip, later that evening, the men decide to get back what they smuggled on them. They hurt, cut, injure, even break both his legs to get their diamonds back, until they kill him. The girl decides to take revenge by taking them down one by one, and thats where the fun begins because she kills them all and at the end, she finishes off the last one in a welding scene fight where she kicks him into a very very hot oven and he explodes into pieces. I think this movie deserves to be REreleased on DVD I sure wish that Imperial would do it like they did Lady Dragon 1. Oh well!"
4,It's good and reasonable price.,"Crabtree & evelyn is really good product. I like this item and it's delivered quickly. I'm satisfied with it.But getting near Christmas, crabtree & evelyn store have kicked off a sale. There was not much in it."
5,excellent,"I knew this product was good already. It's like the third or fourth time I get it. Its great for the winter, and it's a good size to carry around."
5,Love this stuff!,"It is the only hand lotion that really makes a difference in the condition of my hands. Amazon says I need to add three more words. What the heck? Now reviews have a minimum amount of words? Hand therapy is great, amazon is weird."
4,Nice hand cream,Keeps my hands soft and smooth. I like that it doesn't have that flowery smell that some hand creams have.
2,La Source Hand therapy,Product came without the box pictured. It was meant to be a gift. I was disappointed that it was not delivered as shown.
5,Great for dry weather,I keep this lotion at my desk and my hands stay soft and smooth all winter long! I love that it is basically unscented (there is a scent but it is very muted) and unoffensive...perfect for the work place. I wish Crabtree & Evelyn hadn't left the mall but thankfully I can find this product on Amazon!
5,Kitchen Helper,"This stainless steel emesis basin (which, I have observed, would never hold a normal sized stomach evacuation)are the same type as that which we used in hospitals back in the days when patients received real TLC. But that's been a long time ago. I've found that they are a wonderful kitchen receptacle. They are gently curved, so you can hold it under a countertop and sweep debris into it. You can float it together with strawberries (or whatever)in a sink full of water to hold the green caps or other discards. I also use it when soaking my nails before manicuring them--just fill with warm soapy water and insert fingertips. When finished with the kitchen chores, it holds my sponge and ""Tuffy"". It sanitizes with the rest of the dishes in the dishwasher. I wouldn't be without one."
3,"Bad, bad, bad remaster","The remastering for this CD is simply horrible. The sound is totally distorted. If you have access to the vynil or even the original CD you'll know what I mean. Otherwise, this CD should deserve five stars. But it is so mangled I can hardly listen to it, unless in a low volume (so it won't distort so much)."
5,From the Book Cover:,"A wonderful addition to the unique and well-respected WATSA series, Gowler's What Are They Saying About the Parables? introduces as succinctly as possible the current scholarly thinking about the parables of Jesus.Gowler has spent many years mastering parables research and now shares his knowledge of the whole field in a clear, evenhanded, succinct, and energetic manner for ordinary readers. It is an excellent book for all students of the Bible, for classes as well as private enrichment.The chapter headings are: 1. Historical-Critical Approaches to the Parables. 2. The Emergence of Literary Approaches to the Parables 3. Fully Developed Literary Approaches to the Parables 4. The Parables and Their Jewish Contexts 5. The Parables and Their Hellenistic Contexts 6. The Parables and Their Social Contexts 7. From Simile and Metaphor to Symbol and Emblematic LanguageGowler is the Pierce Professor of Religion at Oxford College of Emory University in Oxford, Georgia."
5,My introduction to Jimmy,"This was the first book I read writen By x president Jimmy CarterI was one of you who didn't give him a second chance,(Because of all the yellow ribbons in my neighborhood,) Which in my case This book opened my eyes to what he was dealing with while in office.GREAT BOOK to make you feel ashamed, If you like me were feeling pretty hawkish at the time HOSTAGES issues were all over the front page.This man will be recorded as our biggest blunder not keeping him in office! If we want to be thought of as a great people insted of our current world wide profile"
2,"interesing man, but not really evangelical","This book has a lot going for it: nicely packaged, well-written, thoughtful, candid. At times I really enjoyed it. But overall I found it a little disappointing. Carter endless boasting is too much to stomach.The most helpful aspect of this book was to understand better the contours of Carter's personal theology. What is very clear is that by any classical standard Carter may be a committed Christian but he is no evangelical. His beliefs include: Homosexual practice is acceptable (p.187), Biblical inerrancy is ridiculous (p.197-8), Reinhold Niebuhr and Soren Kierkegaard are his favorite theologians, Mormons are Christian, evolution is not up for debate....A pretty helpful book for political junkies needing to know more about Carter, but not as helpful as an inspirational aid for Christians.I probably would have given it 3 stars if I hadn't gone into it with higher hopes."
5,"Great writer, kind heart","I really enjoyed Carter's writing style, clear and concise, and easy to read. I'll read all the rest of his books now. I enjoyed the candid glimpses into his family life as well as bits about the Presidency and what he has been doing since then. Actually, it is pretty amazing the international work that goes on through The Carter Center! Jimmy Carter truly does live his faith it seems, and he has a humble spirit which says alot for his character given the public life he has lead. Likewise, his life partner and wife Rosalynn is a real jewel and goes right with Carter on his many peace keeping missions, or home building excursions for Habitat For Humanity. He readily admits that she has helped form him into a better man, husband, and father. I think the Carters had a unique living situation in Georgia during the worst years of racial tension. It is refreshing to read of a family that lived what they believed."
5,Insightful and Inspiring,This is an absolutely wonderful read. Carter shares the story of his personal spiritual journey in the Christian faith through events in his life. He chronicles how his commitment to Christ has matured from its simple beginnings in small town Georgia to a life of love and a faith in action. It gave deeper insight into how his faith has shaped his decisions as a political leader and an activist for peace. Carter shows that he is extremely thoughtful and intentional in all he does. This spiritual autobiography is an inspiring work from a seasoned Christian and worth reading whether you agree with his political views or not.
4,Road Map to Living Your Faith,"Jimmy Carter has written a wonderful memoir using his personal struggles as a way to better live his faith. The life incidents in the book are told so honestly that it is evident that here is a man who is dealing with his own shortcomings, but trying to live his life as he believes Jesus would have him do it. Because of that, Living Faith becomes a wonderful road map for those of us who are also all-too-human but who truly desire to know and do our Heavenly Father's will. I found the observations regarding the early years of his marriage candid and illuminating. The wooden check good for one apology which he made in his wood shop and gave to Rosalyn was a great example of putting your values into action. From this book, we see a man who is inspired by Christ, not shackled by dogma, and who sincerely strives to live the Word and make the world a better place. I recommend this book as one that inspires and stimulates our higher impulses to do good. Don't miss it!"
4,Great stuff - must have.,"Come Back, Mister Meaner, and Fireball Zone make this CD worth acquiring. A ""Best Of"" CD of Ocasek would be a monster of great stuff."
3,Fireball zone,"The cars are my favorite band and I love rica solo work but his third album fireball zone wasn't as big as a hit for me as his other solo work. Thisbis his first solo release after the cars broke up, there are a couple tracks that are ok like touch down easy and over and over, but this album was ok at the most, I love his other solo work but this is my least favorite of his solo albums."
1,It doesn't match what the cars used to do,"I liked the cars' material alot,anyone whopicks up their GREATEST HITS cd can easilyagree,i even liked DOOR TO DOORand some of ric ocasek's songs on his solo albumsbut no matter how many times i listened to thiscd not a single song could create an emotionlike his other great compositions.The magic of the cars cannot befound at all on this cd."
4,Another City girls classic.,I'm only going to state that this is another ambassodor video that was supposed to be 55 mins long but is edit till 40 mins. That means only 4 girls are in this video instead of 5. This would had been another 5 star video but because of the edit is what made this a 4 star. Save your money on this one alone and get it now with the girls of capitol hill for the price of one.
2,So-So,There are only four girls on the whole video. The black jack dealer is shown dealing cards then taking her clothes off. She deals cards slower than she disrobes. Its not terrible but not too good either. Its only 40 minutes long & should be under ten dollars
4,Banff National Park,"For anyone who sees earth's beauty, and wonders what made it so, this is a wonderful book. Weave your way through Banff National Park, using geological formations as guideposts to the history of earth. Imagine the tremendous forces that created the scenery before your eyes; glaciers, huge thrusted mountain belts, glacial valleys and lakes, waterfalls, and hot springs. Also look at the minutia, the marine fossils that are held within the mountain rock. Issued by the Geological Survey of Canada, it is a guide to understanding, and in that a revering of one of nature's most beautiful places. It is easy to read for the non-geologist, and contains many pictures, a fold out map, and an index. It is also small enough to be easily carried in a backpack."
2,Moby chooses Deborah Harry for New York New York vocals,"Moby did the original vocals for this sole new track, ""New York New York"", for his best of CD: ""Go- the very best of Moby"". But, before its final release, he called in the best person to do the vocals for this track, Deborah Harry. Why it was released as a three part CD single is a mystery. Part 3 has all of the tracks on part 1 and 2. Part one has only the single edit of ""New York New York"" and none of the dance remixes. Part one also has the dance remix of ""Go"". If you can get them, part 3 or part 2 are the better choices. If you are a fan of Moby, part 1 may satisfy you. But, if you are a fan of Deborah Harry, only part 2 or 3 will do."
2,Interesting snack,"Well, working with a friend from India I ordered this thinking it would be a treat from home for him. Turns out its not quite what he would have expected. The flavor is nice but it does have a hint of a slightly strange flavor. I had expected a ""sweet"" like the U.S. version that looks similar but is made of honey. This is nice but not sweet."
5,This is the funny truck,This is a nice truck.it can run on the road.When my battery is fully charged it runs one hour.I love R/C vahicles.I collect 5 vahicles two of nikko and three of new bright.But this one is the best truck of mine
4,this is a good truck for the money,"This truck is fast,durable, and a good value. If you are looking for a nice,small R/C the nikko harley-davidson truck is for you."
4,Fat rope!,"Cody loves it! Strong, durable rope (we don't let him chew on it) great for hours of tugging! Thanks Flossy Chews!"
4,Chiming in...,"This is absurd. The negative reviewer said ""I can't write enough bad things about this product,"" or something along those lines, but he hardly even WROTE anything bad about them!Order--why do you want them in order? What purpose could that possibly serve?Font--they look fine to me. What, exactly, is wrong with the font? Is it too small? If you're going to be reading Japanese competently, you're going to have to read font this small, and smaller, in the real world. Japanese use small font sometimes.The only gripe I have with these cards is the romanji. I actually would prefer to just read the kana. The romanji is a distraction and hindrance, in my opinion. I know the kana, and if I did not, I would get kana flashcards, learn the kana, and then use these.I have actually whited out the romanji on my cards. All 1000 of them.I think they're a steal. 1000 words is a great vocabulary foundation."
2,Not recommended,"One side in romaji, another side in English. No kanji, no hiragana, no katakana. It is difficult for learning purpose. No explanation on grammar nor in vocabs. Not for beginner. Not really worth USD 15.00."
4,magic,"This recording has energy, sparkle and extraordinary musicianship. I wish I had of been at that particular show. Nothing can top their cd 'East Meets West' with Nigel Kennedy, but this is a magnificent addition to any collection. ""Ajde Jano"" live goes off like a rocket.Awesome."
3,T.H. 2004 not so hot!,"Totally Hits 2003 was as awesome as now 14. But The predictions for totally hits 2004 vol.1 aren't so hot! It needs more rythm and beat, not clay or ruben. Predictions dont look as hot as now 15!"
3,Okay,"I would get it from the library and listen and if I like it I would buy it. It sounds good and lots of songs that I like. But not enough good songs to buy (for me). I would not say it would be bad for you, I'm just saying not good enough for me."
3,"These are my predictions for 'TOTALLY HITS 2004, VOLUME 1!!'","I came up with predictions for 'T.H. 2004, Vol. 1' too...1. Jason Mraz - ""You & I Both""2. Clay Aiken - ""Invisible""3. Sarah McLachlan - ""Fallen""4. Dido - ""White Flag""5. Christina Aguilera - ""The Voice Within""6. Michelle Branch - ""Breathe""7. Simple Plan - ""Perfect""8. Pink - ""Trouble""9. Twista featuring Kanye West & Jamie Foxx - ""Slo Jamz""10. OutKast featuring Sleepy Brown - ""The Way You Move""11. Sean Paul featuring Sasha - ""I'm Still In Love With You""12. Kelis - ""Milkshake""13. Alicia Keys - ""You Don't Know My Name""14. Ruben Studdard - ""Sorry 2004""15. R. Kelly - ""Step In The Name Of Love""16. Luther Vandross - ""If I Didn't Know Better""17. Trapt - ""Still Frame""18. Evanescence - ""My Immortal""19. Switchfoot - ""Meant To Live""20. Jet - ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl""...Agree/disagree, anyone??..."
3,Could have been better,"There are a few tracks I would have taken away. Here's a list of ones that should have been on (or be on a 2004 version).Hey Ya - OutkastInvisible - Clay AikenHolidae In - ChingyGimmie The Light or Get Busy - Sean PaulThe Way You Move - OutkastFeeling This - blink 182There are others, but this really could (and should) have been better. They picked popular artists but bad songs."
2,"Some good, most bad","Here are my reviews for the songs:1.F- A bad start2.F- Not getting any better...3.F- Will it ever end?4.A+ Finally, a good song!5.B Going up...6.F- Going down...7.F- and down...8.F- and down...9.F- and down.10.A Alright!11.F Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!12.A+ The best song on this CD!13.F- Danger: Bad songs ahead!14.F- Stop while your ahead!15.F- Turn back now!16.F- You will die!17.F- Stop please18.F- Your not turning back!19.F- You have been warned20.F- Death is hereThe good: Sean Paul, Ruben Studdard, R.Kelly, and FabolousThe bad: The restOverall:Buy this if you want to commit suicide"
3,My predictions/facts for Totally Hits 2004,"After looking at the cover art for Totally Hits 2004 vol. 1, I think the tracklist'll be something like...1. Jason Mraz: You And I Both2. Kelis: Milkshake3. J-Kwon: Tipsy4. Ying Yang Twins: Salt Shaker5. Jin: Learn Chinese6. T.I.: Rubber Band Man7. Missy Elliot: Pass That Dutch8. Sean Paul feat. Sasha: I'm Still In Love With You9.

Michelle Branch: Breathe16. Alicia Keys: You Don't Know My Name17. Kelly Clarkson: The Trouble With Love18. Simple Plan: Perfect19. Christina Aguilera: The Voice Within20. Dido: White FlagI'm sure about every artist except Jin. (Songs are speculations though) No OutKast, though? Makes you wonder... Still, arguably better than NOW 15."
4,Lovely story about the grown up Tippy,"Tippy Parrish Jordan has always been such a loveable heroine, you just knew she'd grow up & stay so loveable. And she did. This book, the last in the series, has Tippy as mother of two and happily married to Major Peter Jordan. Marny is a 14 year old ward of the state that has been babysitting for the Jordan's when Tippy takes an interest in her. Next thing you know, the Jordan kids have a big sister! If you love the Parrishes, this is a must read."
4,Works great - No leakage,"I purchased this underwater case for my Canon SD700 to use snorkeling in Hawaii. It worked perfectly - no leakage and the shots came out great. I have 2 complaints though - 1)Sometimes the inside of the lens fogged up and i'm not sure why. This usually happened after I had been using the camera in the water and I wanted to use it on land or in a pool - both times the environment was hotter than where I had been snokeling. The second problem I had was with the positioning of the selection wheel for selecting what mode you were using (auto, manual, video etc). With the camera outside of the case I have no problems but for some reason when I held the case underwater I had a tendancy to hold the wheel and turn it without knowing - so was a result I ended up taking some videos when I meant to take a picture. Annoying. But overall a great way to extend the usage of your Canon SD700 camera."
4,Second Digital Camera Waterproof Case,"This is the second canon waterproof case I have purchased. Both have been great. I would like it if the flash diffuser was not so cumbersome and attached differently (it has a ring on the end of the zoom lens enclosure). This one is bulkier due to the 4x lens extension. Overall these are great to protect your camera for trips to the beach, lake, pool, and/or some snorkeling/light diving. One tip: use the wrist or neck strap, you don't want to lose this case/camera, not to mention the pictures that you have on the card."
1,Canon does not provide warranty coverage for cases!,"I recently received a similar Canon waterproof case and found after the first use the the glass lens cover was permanently fogged thus preventing any further photos. Obviously a manufacturing defect. The glass lens cover is composed of two layers and once fogged cannot be de-fogged or wiped. Canon provided ZERO support for their waterproof cases and should this happen you are completely out of luck!Their email reply to my request for help:"" Unfortunately the water-proof housings do not come with any kind ofwarranty expressed or implied in any way. The manual that comes withthe housing is to be followed in performing maintenance on the waterproof housing and is strictly up to the user to comply with theprocedures in the manual.I am sorry for the inconvenience, but we cannot provide you withany real assistance with this matter.Sincerely,Technical Support Representative"""
4,Works well underwater,"I've used this once for a trip. It works very well underwater. Pictures come out great and no water gets in. Just a bit pricey, but worth it for the protection."
2,Poor Quality - Arrived Broken,"This product, although it does look good on the screen, is of poorer quality than one would expect for the price. Mine was poorly packaged, and the middle sorter piece was broken in the shipping process. I attempted to reassemble, but the wood/screws had stripped and would no longer hold."
5,Nice small footprint for holding papers,This is a nice looking file holder with a nice small footprint for holding papers to be filed. It's best for papers that are no larger than a folded-in-half 8.5 by 11 piece of paper. I use it for separating receipts/papers to be shredded from papers to be filed. I would recommend it.
3,Six in Paris,"I've been looking for this film for many years and am glad to have this video. The picture quality, however, is somewhat disappointing, and the image is `full frame'. I don't know exactly what the original format was but it was clearly filmed in some form of wide screen. The film is marvellous - especially the segments by Rouch and Chabrol. Better than nothing but I hope for a DVD soon!"
3,Poor video quality,"Vignettes of six Parisian neighborhoods prior to 1968, but video has poor quality. This DVD needs a Criterion Collection type production."
5,"Simple, Straightforward Bible stories for Kids","My four and six year olds like this DVD a lot and so do I! There are five ten minute stories which can be viewed individually or continuously in english or spanish (I like that option, the kids can learn about God and a foreign language!) The stories and animation are quite simple, without much imbellishing; just the straightforward Bible stories presented at a young child's level. Although some may consider the stories oversimplified, I think the pure, simple presentation lets the beauty and thruth of the Bible shine through!"
4,Mostly good,"Lots of songs, but not interested in some of the last ones. Could totally do without the last LONG interview."
4,More great harmonies,great harmonies on a varied selection on Holiday tunes. Not just the same dozen overdone by so many artists.
3,"Get ""Ultimate Christmas"" instead","""Christmas With the Beach Boys"" is nothing more than a repackaging of the Beach Boys' ""Ultimate Christmas"" with a song omitted. The omitted song is ""Christmas Time is Here Again,"" which is actually a rather catchy tune and has no justifiable reason to be omitted here. Don't waste your money on this lesser version when you can have a 5 star version with ""Ultimate Christmas,"" which is indeed the ultimate Beach Boys Christmas CD."
3,"Good, But Not As Good As I Remember","I'm glad I got this CD, it has a lot of songs with a good mix of slower and spirited ones. Nevertheless, it fell short of what I was hoping for.What I was wanting mostly, but it wasn't there, was the great stereo sound of the original Beach Boys Christmas Album way back in the 60's. The HIGH FIDELITY STEREO SOUND of the vocal intro. to Little Saint Nick on that album was REALLY SPECIAL...wow, what voices and what harmony! Conversely, the vocal and instrumental mix on this CD are, in my opinion, not so good (the volume of the vocal and instrumental parts is disproportionate: the vocal is too loud, the instrumental too soft). And, this CD doesn't have that great stereo sound of the original BB's Christmas Album."
2,NOT for my Canon A720IS,"This adapter gets in the way period... borders on 4 corners. If I zoom in to lose the borders, then it's not as wide as it should be. I used it with the recommended WC-DC58N wide converter. I'll keep the wide angle converter and fit it to another camera."
3,"Does what it says, but consider if you need it.","This nifty little gadget will let you use all those great filters you bought when you had your SLR phase. The problem is the A710/720 just isn't a good enough camera to justify the extra bulk and annoyance of using this thing. Also, there's no realistic way to use a circular polarizer, as the LCD on the camera isn't accurate enough.Still, if you want to use funky diffraction, coloured or even ND filters, this is incredibly easy to use."
1,treasure of ruby hills,"this film is very bad with sound on dialog, the music and actions come in are loud then you have to lower the sound then turn up the dialog sound to hear it , Lee Van Cleef shows his picture on the cover and start with his name as the main actor, but that is wrong as you only see him in a couple cameo scenes for about 2 mins . it is a very bad part for Zachary scott and very poor acting, for a western it is not as good as it looks and not worth buying, I love westerns but this is the worst i have seen for 2 good actors as cleef and scott also it is in B/W there are many good westerns far better than this on the market it really is a disapointment"
4,Treasure of Ruby Hills,Lower budget 50's Western about a territorial feud for water rights. Lee Van Cleef would have been better in the Zachary Scott role but still an enjoyable film.
1,worse than you could imagine,"the local PBS station aired one episode of this Canadian wonder, there was so much negative feedback they never showed a second. true story."
5,funny show,can;t wait for xmas so i can watch them with the receiver of this gift!!! this came in right on time.
5,The Red Green show,"This is a great compilation of the Red Green show....Very funny!This will give you lots of entertaining hours.If you like this kind of comedy, this is for you!"
4,I think it will be a hit!,"I bought this for a 2-year old buddy of mine who loves airplanes (along with the Lots & Lots of Jets DVD). I think he is going to love it! I expected it to be a bit more sturdy than it is - it is rather thin given its height and width, which makes it seem a bit cheap."
4,Great airplane book for the little pilot,"Lots of fun for little ones - great gift idea for a future pilot, or to fill a shelf in baby aviator nursery!"
3,Good mixes BUT ....,"All the Amber remixes would have been great if they had been extended. There is only one song - This Is Your Night (Jnr Vasquez Sunday Night Bump) which is extended. The rest are all edited versions, leaving you feeling a little cheated. Apparently the extended versions are only on vinyl. There is also an unreleased mix of Taste The Tears, also remixed by Thunderpuss but again it is edited."
3,A few hidden gems. Edited.,"I was looking forward to getting my hands on this disc for quite some time - I kept telling myself that the songs were going to be original mixes, full length regardless of how many tracks the producer crammed on this album...well, I was correct. Most of the remixes are edits.This being the case, this album is okay...it does feature some out-of-print jems (the collaboration with Ultra Nate and Jocelyn is superb. Too bad both mixes are edits...)All in all, I recommend this cd to most, just don't come lookin' for full length house mixes -rave on.jason."
3,A marketing lesson,"While Amber is a great singer and the mixes are of a good standard, why did the executives at her record label release edited versions of most of the songs on this CD? Apparently all the extended versions appear on vinyl. I'm sorry but I think a lot of people are going to feel ripped off - especially since this can be categorised as a dance CD .. who wants to dance to a 3 minute song!??"
3,they made me a criminal-ROAN DVD,"ROAN boasts these movies are re-mastered from the best possible sources but when i saw the poor quality of the print i was very disappointed. The print of lady gangster is better, both of which are decent movies. I recently saw ""Criminal"" on Turner Classic Movies and the print was exceptional. why couldn't ROAN use that print? you get what you pay for."
4,Mobile tutorial,"Mobile Data and Wireless Lan Technologies is a book to help system administrators. Some buildings are hard to wire.Some people are hard to keep plugged in. When the telecommunication or I.T. manager calls in a consultant, how will they talk? This book is a tutorial for the administrator or network technician .It covers a large range of topics. It will not make the reader an expert. It may allow the reader to ask important questions."
3,G.F.R. Sell Out,"Grand Funk (Railroad) has to be the ultimate example of a one time great rock band that sold out to commercialism and pop ditties in the hopes of having continued success. To go from such classics as ""Heartbreaker, Mean Mistreater"" and Footstompin' Music"" to such pop tripe as ""The Locomotion, Some Kind of Wonderful and Bad Time"" is a shame. The former three songs would get a five star rating but unfortunately the bubble gum that came out after ""We're An American Band"" cancels that out. Bands change with the times but if they don't keep a part of the formula that made them great then they fade from sight as this once terrific band did. Adding Craig Frost as the fourth man on keyboards was a positive for a time but even that got old fast. A pity."
5,A good representation of Grand Funk Railroad's career,"At first glance you may think Classic Masters is just another Grand Funk Railroad Hits CD, and it is that. But it is also a 24 BIT fully remastered Hits CD and it sounds absolutely wonderful. If you have Capitol Collectors Sires, Great Grand Funk, More Of The Best, Super Best, etc., there all good, but this CDs sound simply blow's all those CDs away. This Classic Masters CD has a good representation of Grand Funk Railroad's career at Capitol (69-76) from Time Machine and Mean Misterater, to I'm Your Captian/Closer To Home (There Magus Opus), to We're An American Band (there biggest Hit) Walk Like A Man and Shinin On (Both Big its), to Take me and Bad Time (there two last Radio hits whit Bad Time being the most played song on the radio in 76). This is a MUST Have for any Grand Funk Railroad Fan; A Must have for anyone who gets hits CDs of the bands they like; and a must have for anyone who want's to try Grand Funk Railroad out."
4,Surviving hard times,This is an excellent book covering all aspects of meat preservation. If you are a person that doesn't want to be at the mercy of wild prices then buy in bulk and start putting it away using this guide.
1,Large quantities,"The Canning, Freezing, Curing and Smoking of Fish and Game, seemed that is was written more for domestic animals than game. While the information was cited well, with full USDA references. In the directions for these processes, quantities were given that I couldn't imagine using unless I had a whole cow or pig to do."
4,"jay-z, is that you?","this is a good song nice beat, nice flow but, i think they might be playing on the fact that the lead rapper sounds a lot like jay-z, which in turn might have their record sales raise up .. it might cause a little confusion but, still a good song"
4,Cross the Border Review,"At first listen, you may think it's Jay-Z and M. Bleek. The song is definitely a hot club/party track. It's extremely radio-friendly, but doesn't go too over-board. After listening to their album, it's obvious why Jay-Z didn't sign them when he plucked Beanie Sigel from the group. No need to have 2 MCs who have some vocal similarities on the same label. It's spells disaster. Ask Puffy."
4,Pretty good game...,I Liked the General playability The freelook wan't to my taste however(Glad It has the option to turn it off). My player tended to get stuck on objects and doorways alot when i tried too peek and shoot around corners(This is a bug and should be fixed). Enemy design is original in it own way and they are fun to figure out each weakness. Weapons concept was great however targeting in the overhead view is sometime difficult. I think the idea of no savegames is acually a good idea however maybe savepoints would have been useful for some players. My final point is the story. Interesting concept and execution however the ending was anticlimactic I think it should have been more rewarding after the endboss was so hard. I loved the plot of it but maybe the detail was were it fell short.
5,FUN GAME!,"I really enjoy this game. Even with a top down format, the graphics are great and the overall game play is challenging without ever getting too hard. I would recommend it to anyone who just enjoys fun shooter games. Delivery was prompt and the game was in excellent condition."
2,Yikes! This is on vinyl!,"Not only is it on vinyl, but it's 3 versions of one song and it's a song from the Satta album, which I already have of course.Other than these complaints, Boozoo Bajou is great. The music is smooth, groovy, acid jazz, chill out music that will not get boring. That's why I had to find something else from them. Too bad I'll never get to hear it. I didn't know bands still put vinyl out. Maybe vinyl is so out that it's in now and I'm not hip enough to know it. Whatever."
1,Bonekickers,"Anyone looking for an ""Indy"" meets ""Bones"" experience, or even an enjoyable show, will be truly disappointed. It is painfully obvious why this was not renewed; the characters are one dimensional and the supposed archeology work is flawed supposition, not science. The major feeling generated by the series was ""who cares."" Not entertainment but drudgery."
5,Absolutely Entertaing...Wonderful,"I won't give you a long review as there are already many of those. I'll just say this was exactly what I was hoping it would be. Who cares about historical accuracy or believable plots ? If you are looking for some ""Indiana Jones"" type escapism ......this is for you. I loved it........and I want more."
4,Pretty good ---,"This show kept my interest going --- I have always liked archaology and mysteries/thrillers and this combines both --- perhaps some of the acting is a big ""hammish"" at times --- but the story and plot are good and keep one's interest --- do yourself a favor and buy or rent this..."
2,Good Idea but series lacked interest,I got this set as a gift and though it sounded real interesting. But unfortunately the series was pretty dry. None of the characters became real likable as the shows went on and the story line felt thrown together. I found myself falling asleep during the episodes and I normally like most of the showing coming out of the UK. This was just not one of their winners.
5,Walking in the Light: 30 Days with Pope John Paul II,"A small volume perfect for use as a daily devotional for 30 days. Each topic gives a selection from the Pope's words taken from his numerous trips along with a scripture, prayer and an action to be taken that day. Beautiful pictures of the Holy Father. I thoroughly enjoyed using it and have passed copies on to 10 of my friends."
2,Sorry -- not good.,"I've had the other Annie's shells and cheddar and they're usually very good. I wanted to try whole wheat to be healthier, but it's really not worth it. It has a different texture that I didn't like. The flavor was okay but a little bland. If you want a good mac and cheese, stick with the original version from Annie's!"
3,Add your own flavor to make it a 5,"All by itself, I would have to give this a 3. But, as I've learned with most packaged food, it can be easily made into a 5. I prepare as described on the box and top with mixed Italian herbs, crushed red pepper, and a pinch of shredded Parmesan. Not only does it look more appetizing, but it tastes great! And these are things I usually keep around the house, so I just grabbed whatever I had and it only adds about 30 seconds to the prep process. I highly recommend if you're willing to add things you like to flavor it up."
3,The taste is not for me,"I honestly don't care for the taste of the white cheddar. It was too bland and chalky for me (not smooth and creamy). My husband is finishing the case for me since he is not picky about food as long as it is made for him. The shells were yummy and when cooked long enough I found them to have a nice consistency and were tasty without the white cheddar sauce. Don't forget to mix the power and the milk together before adding the pasta, I know it is on the box but who takes the time to read the box?"
3,"Not bad, but a little disappointing.","I'm a big fan of Annie's Shells and White Cheddar (the purple box), so I figured I'd try this to see if it was as good. It's ok, but the whole grain pasta is very whole-grainy. It doesn't quite cook the same, the texture difference is very noticeable and the sauce doesn't seem to blend with it as well."
5,my kids love this,Both my boys love this mac & cheese. The whole wheat is not a replacement for those who grew up on Kraft.
4,A solid sample,"It Bites built a reputation as a solid pop-prog band of the 80's, lead my Francis Dunnery. During Dunnery's time in the band they released 3 albums, of which you get a few tracks in this compilation. If you like the pop side of It Bites, then this is a 5 star compilation for you. But if you are interested in the ""proggy"" side of It Bites be advised, this album has edited versions, which cuts a few of the instrumentally inclined moments, and there's a few longer, proggier songs not included in this compilation. This becomes then a good introduction to the band... but there is more to explore.I can also recommend THE TALL SHIPS, an album without Francis Dunnery, but with John Mitchell doing a hell of a job on a very melodic, proggy pop album."
5,Amazing Band,"Ok I've got to say that this group should be one of history's great supergroups! One Small Boat just grabbed me and didn't let go! Step Into My Groove & Surrender Now are simply awesome tracks, Ghost Beside My Bed is the track that's gotten the most attention but One Small Boat is so obviously the overlooked child in the family! Not only is this CD mind numbingly amazing but Dos follows up in regal fashion and feeds the soul as completely as Altered State does. The best thing that anyone can do for themselves is to not only get this CD, but to also invest in DOS. This band is such a treat to the listener, they should be honored as national treasures!"
4,Interesting Discovery,"This CD was in the discount bin. I was leery because I had never heard of the band and the cover didn't even tell you what type of music it contained. I'm glad I took the risk. Because it was released before the advent of the web, it was difficult to find any background information. I just looked up their entry on Wikipedia. No wonder I connected with this album. I love all of their influences(Pink Floyd, U2). I am a hardcore Rush fan. I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the guitar/keyboard oriented rock bands of the late 70's and 1980's."
4,Entertaining and enlightening reading for baseballs fans,"Being an avid Dick Allen fan in the 60's and 70's, I thought I was the expert on this great slugger. ""Crash"" showed me how little I really knew about this warm and introspective man. The book is a real ""page turner"", discussing Allen's athletic exploits as a youth and throughout his exciting and turbulent career. As one would expect, many entertaining baseball stories and behind-the-scenes anecdotes are contained in these pages. But probably the most important and engrossing feature of ""Crash"" is the portrait it paints of the climate of race relations in the '60's, both in baseball and society. Readers who remember Allen's days in Philadelphia will truly gain a new enlightened perspective of this athlete and his career, a view which often contradicts the media reports and stories which circulated at that time. ""Crash"" is enjoyable reading for the baseball fan, but could also be of merit in the classroom."
3,Newspaper tube,"A bit expensive, but it does the job.Not many people get home delivery of newspapers these days.It is nice to have the paper in the tube where it won't blow away or get rained on."
4,"GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE",ALREADY IN USE AND WOULD BY ANOTHER. I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT TWO TO START WITH AND WILL PROBABLY DO SO.
5,Mom loves!,Purchased this for my mother who lives out in the country. It is sturdy and exactly what she wanted. She's mentioned numerous times how happy she is with the product.
1,WAY OVERPRICED,"This is seriously overpriced for what essential is a piece of plastic. I'd rather go DIY, spend 5 bucks and be done with it."
2,Poor Quality,"I got this large display so I could see who was calling while watching TV. Despite its size, it's only visible from maybe 3 feet away, and even then it's not easily readable. I returned it. The ""font"" of the letters and numbers also makes it difficult to read. The screen doesn't light up (like green in the background to contrast more with black letters) when a call comes in. Finally, it doesn't even come with a power adapter. It would be ok if you're close to it, but then the small, good quality, easily readable screens I have on other boxes and phones around the house are more appropriate for normal viewing distances."
3,Disappointment,"This ID unit works, and the dial button to call back is very helpful. However, it is top heavy and very difficult to read the display."
5,Wondeful aid for screening calls,"Really like this unit, but not as bright and easy to read as I thought it would, I have it plugged into the house power line. I am going to buy a second and maybe third one for other phones in the house."
2,blaaa,"I have an older husky version, which is the same as CH, and the older models were way better 10 yrs ago. Now though these newer CH and Husky ones that R identical barely do anything. plus the way the water comes out the resevoir in these new models you can never get rid of all the water in them, because the valve sits about 3/16 inches above the bottom of the resevoir, thus, water is always left in it. I suggest getting a better filter. By the way I live in dry Phoenix, AZ and a lot of moisture gets past the filter. So if you live some place with a lot of rain or humidity then definitely get a bigger better filter."
2,Had to Return,"There was no provision for mounting this filter on a wall. No brackets included or tabs on the housing. I didn't want to improvise something, so I returned the filter. The instructions show a bracket along with a regulator and other unit. I looked up the brackets on the C H website. With shipping, they would have cost almost as much as the filter. Disappointed."
5,Bought it to go on my Campbell Hausfield compresspr,Can't be beat it for the price. I bought it to go on my C/H aircompressor. The onley thing I don't understand is why they make a filter that's 3/5in for a compressor that has a 1/2in outlet. Works fine.
5,Great filter,It's well build does the job well. What more can I say about this. It does work as sopose to.
4,Another notable mention for E. Lynn!,"Another notable mention for E. Lynn! The story centers around a magazine called Bling Bling, which is run by an black man with a questionable past. Then, there is Zola; the chief editor of the magazine who isn't sure about whether she'll be giving love a try. E. Lynn brings back some old favorites like Raymond, who is on retainer as an attorney, living all alone in New York, and exploring a new type of ""friendship"" with Basil. After an objectional article on Yancey is published, Zola and Raymond get into a fierce battle. The story ends with Raymond and Zola each finally geting what and who they want. There are also appearances by Nicole, Jared, Kirby, Moms, Pops, and Trent, characters from previous literary works from E. Lynn. You'll really enjoy this one."
3,"Not his best work, but, it is a good novel","I bought the book and read it in two days. It is not his best work, If This World Were Mine was the best {to me}, but, it is a good novel. The only thing that I was not amused by was to see the return of Basil and how Raymond, always, seems to turn into jello around him. Come on!! It has been 10 years of this cat and mouse game. What is going to be in the next installment of the Basil and Raymond Show? Basil having Raymond hide in a closet again? And, this time, will it be in the house that Raymond and Basil share? You, kinda, want to see Raymond with someone of equal sex appeal as Basil, but, is comfortable with himself and not a flaming ""queen"". And, give up on this never ending quest with Basil. The excitement wore off in ""Just As I Am"" and, being that the character is in his forties, should admit to himself that you can't change a tiger's stripes. Once a closeted homophobe, well, you get the point."
3,Mr. Harris has done better,"I am a big ELH fan, and I have read all of his novels. This one left me feeling incomplete. To me, the ending was rushed, and there were too many characters that didnt have to be to make the story flow. I also didn't like Basil and Raymond's relationship in this book. I miss the old Basil. I will continue to read his work, but I hope the next novel is a little less ""soap opera"" and alittle more realistic."
1,Another Disappointment,"I started off madly in love with this series. The characters were well written, and even if they were not always likeable, they were at least all well defined. With the last two books, however, I feel like each book is nothing more than groundwork for the next one. And unfortunately, I am getting more and more disillusioned, to the point where his next book will not be an automatic purchase. E. Lynn, please, ditch Basil already, and Yancy, and go back to the full character development and plotlines that hooked me in the first place!!! Anyone reading this, wait for it to come to your local library and check it out. I don't think it's worth investing your dollars to purchase."
4,love like I'm going to live forever...,"I really enjoyed this one, as I do all of E. Lynn's books. 'A Love of My Own' started out a fast read then it seemed to wane a bit in the middle. I thought I would be disappointed. I wasn't, however, when at the end it blew up with excitement. You'll have to read it yourself to see why.But on a scale of 1 to 5, I give this one a 4. And of course I'll be the first one in line for his next bestseller.Keep up the good work, dawg!Chillin' in Manhattan****"
3,A Love of My Own: A Novel,"I am not trying to ""Playa Hate"" but I gotta admit I was a little disappointed in ELH's lastest novel. The main protaginist, Zora Norwood, was little more than a victim for the entire story. The storyline was slow to develop and the characters were very flat. As always ELH's dialogue was realistic. The tone and tempo of story was enhanced by E Lynn's reference to 9-1-1, Alliyahs death and last years historic Oscar night. ELH like Michael Jordan on a off night still manages to entertain."
2,WHEN IS IT GOING TO GET GOOD?,Am I missing something? Or do I just need to be more patient? Mr. Harris' books are normally too good to put down from beginning to end. It usually takes me no more than two days to read his books. I'm currently in the middle and have yet to find out what everyone is raving about. The only reason I continue to read this book is because I know it just has to get better than this! We will see....
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I'M A E.LYNN HARRIS FAN BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK.THE BEGINNING DIDN'T CATCH MY ATTENTION AS THE OTHERS.
2,A fair followup,"I usually love all of Mr Harris' books, but this one left me a bit cold. For some reason Raymond seemed a bit too wishy-washy.The story-line with Zola wasn't that interesting either. The only interesting thing going on with her was a bit of the drama from the relationship with her sister and ex.The ending also left me very dry. There was this buildup on Raymond/Zola and their work situation with Bling Bling, The boss' family background, the situation with Ava and Yancey and everything seemed to get nicely wrapped up in the end in about 2-3 pages - no character development at all.At the end, Davis does a complete 180 and behaves completely out of character and the book doesn't even attempt to explain/develop it!?!?!?"
4,Awesome,"This book is simply awesome! From start to finish it kept me wanting more and more. If you haven't read any way the wind blows, you would want to read it first. It has some of the same charachters.I was also happy to see Ava finally gets what she deserved."
4,I enjoy it ...but somthing was missing...*sadface*,"Harris I did enjoy your storytelling. I think the noval had a great feel at the begin of the book. I truly love the feeling of the 9/11 events. It gave the reader a feeling as being present in New York at that very moment. Harris displays many details and emotion and heart when he is storytelling. He writes you into the scene of the story; therefore, he never loose focus of the reader. As much as I enjoyed the story and the warm-hearted Raymond Tyler and the wild Basil.. the story felt that it was ""rushed."" In addition,the last couple of chapters it was several holds or things that were left unsaid. For Example, What happen with the Zola and Davis dispute? Yes, overall I enjoyed the book and look forward to many more to come. I like the style of Harris's."
5,INTERESTING,I also had a hard time reading this one. Honestly I have only read 26 pages of the book it was very hard at the beginning.I had to put the book down because I was getting a headache. So I bought the cd and I really enjoyed the book. I'm giving the cd five stars.
3,"It was awright, I guess","This is the first E. Lynn Harris book that didn't really move me. Something about the plot left me kinda cold, or maybe it was the characters (I'm a little old to try to relate to characters in their 20s, the same age as my kids), or maybe it was the writing itself. I found it annoying that I had to figure out who the ""I"" was at the beginning of each chapter. And what's with all those tags? He said, I said, he said, I said. Hell, if there's only two people having a conversation most readers are intelligent enough to know who's talking without having to have it pointed out to us.Just okay. I hope his next is better."
2,This is too hard to read,"I bought this book on 8/12/02, and now it's November and I still haven't gotten past the second chapter. It's as if I hit a wall, and couldn't go any further.I like a book that has a story. Beginning, middle, end. I have a writing book that says you should only have ONE main character. This book broke that rule right off. First you're reading about one character, then you're reading about another one...there's no structure. I'm afraid I just can't handle episodic writing. It's as if Lynn Harris was writing a script for a soap opera instead of a novel.I own two books by E. Lynn Harris: his first, Invisible Life, and this one. The first was the best by a long shot. While it's interesting how some of the characters from that first novel had evolved...they alone couldn't hold my interest in this book. Sorry, Mr. Harris, maybe next time."
3,No more,"This is my last E. Lynn Harris book. The formula has worn thin and I'm no longer entertained. I have no problem with his mentioning 9/11 and Aaliyah's death in the book. Harris's books take place in the here and now and this one is in NYC so it makes sense to mention whats going on. However, I'm was not pleased with the weak soap opera plot and the cardboard characters.If you love E. Lynn Harris then this and all the other reviews will mean nothing to you. If you haven't tried his stuff before, skip this one."
2,Lukewarm,"E. Lynn Harris books are usually a lot of fun, but his latest is hampered by corny dialogue and shallow characters. In fact, Harris seems more interested in describing their glittery social lives (and steamy sex lives) than showing us what really makes them tick. The references to Sept. 11 don't add much depth to the story and the ending is ridiculously contrived. If there's a sequel, I hope he puts more thought and heart into it."
2,Just boring and predictable.,"Yes, Harris writes better than most African American male authors...his grammar, spelling and punctuation is good... Everything in this book is so predictable...Being a writer takes a whole lot more time and thought than being an AUTHOR. Seems like this author and most of the other... authors of late appear to copy the scripts of the...daytime soap operas, then place the scripts in novel form...Just because you have a desktop publishing system in the second vacant room at your home does NOT make you a true writer or self-published for that matter. The proof is in the poor novels like most of the ones that are written by Mr. Harris..."
3,"Good Book, but","I'm ready for E. Lynn to move on and bring in new characters for the readers to become attached to. I have been reading about Raymond since his college years, he is now in his forties and he is still unhappy and struggling with his sexuality.This book was like his others. Raymond being the level headed one and Basil being... Basil. In the last few novels, there is always someone or something trying to tear down there so-called happiness, this was the same.Sadly, the story lines are becoming alittle weak, but Basil is always there to bring laughter and lust."
2,Boring,"I have read all the books that E. Lynn Harris has written and this was the worst. The story just didn't make any sense. It was drawn out and so boring, I skipped and skimmed through the last few chapters so that I could finish it. Wish this time I had borrowed it from the library instead of purchasing it, I wouldn't felt so bad about it. Just wasted my money."
3,Alright,"I enjoy reading so naturally i continued to read this book. But to be perfectly honest, the book just wasn't that good. I did enjoy the characters in the book, but i wasn't impressed with the back and forth setting the author had in mind. All in all this author has some geat books (Basketball Jones) I just didnt enjoy this one as much as his others..."
4,E. Lynn Strikes Again!,"October 15th, 1997.That's the day when E. Lynn Harris signed my copy of 'And This Too Shall Pass', his third novel. I'd been a voracious fan from the beginning but that was the day I got to meet the man behind the words. His latest, 'A Love of My Own', places cool new characters with old favorites on a rollercoaster ride through actual traumatic world events, with accuracy . . . and E. L.'s smooth, keepin' it real, style. It's one of those books that hooks you from page one and forces you to read straight to the end.So unplug the phone and lock the bedroom door. E. Lynn Harris is still King of the guilty pleasure read!"
4,I liked it,"I was never really into E. Lynn Harris. That is until I read ""Not a day goes by"". I liked that book a lot, so when this one came out, I wanted to read it. Now I own it. I read it in 3 days. Great book."
5,Too Good To Put Down,This book was just to good! E. Lynn Harris really put his foot in this! When you think one thing is about to happen the opposite happens. I can't wait to read his next book.
3,Get thePoint....... But not enough drama or revenge!!,"Basil basically got what he was instored for having doubts about the so called love he found, and Ms. Yancey having the spoiled girl trouble and the Gold digging mother to cause mayheim, I could have just slapped her myself..... I found the book getting good in the middle when I thought Basil was really going to do some serious PAYBACK!!! But in the end he left just waving a white flag. It could have been better..... That Ms. Ava is a serious headache..... I don't know what happen with Ms. Yancey daugher Madison or the father of the child. ""What happens"" plots at the end of a story sometimes blows the whole book........"
5,WONDERFUL BOOK,"This is one book, along with other E. Lynn Harris's bookS that caught my interest instantly. The xters come to live and I must say they got my total attention. My favorite xter, besides the ever righteous and somewhat confused Raymond, and hunk of all hunks Basil, were Hayden and Kia. They made me laugh so much with the comments they made on everything in life. I can relate more to Raymond and Basil together because that's how my life is.I believe it is a great book you can read over and over again because I read it three times in a row!!!"
5,Another E. Lynn Masterpiece,"I finished reading A Love of My Own on Sunday night & I'm still thinking about that book at work on Monday with a smile on my face. I've been an E.Lynn fan since his first book & I tell you he never ceases to amaze me w/his writing. The man is an absolute phenomenal writer. For all of you E.Lynn fans that haven't read it yet, please go out & get this book immediately!!! You will not be disappointed. The story line grips you & never let go. The ending is going to knock the wind out of you & the only thing I wished for at the end was for some more....E. Lynn please keep them books coming!!!!"
2,Highly Disappointed,"This book started out really well, seemed to start dragging towards the middle, and rushed to a extremely unrealistic conclusion in the last 5 or so chapters. Harris' protagonist was not very engaging - the reader was not drawn to her or sympathic towards her plight. In fact, most of her decisons seemed incongruent with his characterization of her as a beautiful, intelligent, sucessful businesswoman. I had really high hopes after enjoying his previous novels, but was left feeling that I'd finished a different book than the one I'd started."
2,So Let Down.....,"I am sorry to say that I was so disappointed. I too am a very big ELH fan and this book fell way short of his others. He tried to pick it up a notch at the end but, at that point the ending was so predictable that I read on just to finish the book. Mr Harris has and can do much MUCH better than this one. No love lost though E Lynn Harris is still one of my favorite authors."
2,Not one of ELHs' best,"I've always been a fan of Lynn Harris books but this one is far from being one of his best. In fact it feels like that the quality is going down. ""Just as I Am"" and ""Invisible Life"" where really good, but this one seems to be the result of pressure to publish. Also I really hope that this is not the end of Basil and Raymond as it seems. Zola was boring and the other characters are cliches. At times whole chapters where irrelevant to the story line. And only at the last page, where finally Basil and Raymond appear, (and I repeat appear) to finally become a couple, the story ends.Lynn, If I may -- it's time to explore. How about fatherhood for Raymond, he doing the cheating, falling in love to a woman. He guiding a desperate young gay guy. How about exploring other races. A latino or a white guy will add some spark. It's time to get out of the confort zone or loose relevance. Keep this in mind, we need your voice!"
2,Less than expected,"This novel seemed formulaic -- following the ""How to Write a Novel"" guidelines. It didn't take long before I became annoyed by the name dropping. There are so many better writers in the world, I can't imagine how this one has become so popular."
4,Not as good as the others.,"This book was not as good as the others but it still was a quick enjoyable read. I think ELH fans wanted more sex scenes and details. But it had a few surprises, and some twists. It also had some real life events in it that I liked, it made the book seem surreal. I wanted to jump in the lives of the characters and help solve some of there problems, however when it ended I still had a few unanswered questions. But that's ok, E.Lynn will probably have a come back on his next book and answer all of my questions. He really is a creative author. Keep up the good work."
3,I Feel A Little Let Down,"I must say that I do enjoy Mr. Harris as an author, but this story was like a good cooked meal that was missing ""the soul food seasoning"".To be honest I can not quite put my finger on what's missing, but I definitely have to say that he needed to upstage Basil in the story. Let Basil chose what he is going to be homosexual, heterosexual or just bi-sexual. I know that confusion maybe realistic but for a book the confusion gets a little tiring.The humor in the book was funny, I found myself laughing out loud at the characters' inner voices and the cracks that they made on each other.I know if you're a true E. Lynn Harris fan you are going to read this book, but please don't expect the formula that he had in the beginning. Even though I feel a little let down with his last work I still got love for him."
3,A Love of My Own,"While enjoying previous novels of E. Lynn Harris - Invisible Life - Just As I Am, I was very disappointed with A Love of My Own. Why was there a need for several characters from the past to make cameo appearances? I have always enjoyed reading his novel's in one night. To say the least this is one I continued to pick up and put back down - I found it boring and not as exciting as other novels. I hope his next one will be more satisfying."
4,Another Smash..,"E. Lynn Harris does not disappoint with this latest installment, weaving a tale of sadness, intrigue, hints of romance, and some very contemporary issues into a very entertaining book. I own every book E. Lynn has ever written, and this book is just as consistently good as all the others.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because I was a little heartbroken at how lonely and slightly desperate Raymond seemed throughout the whole book. He's usually so strong and sure of himself in the other books - this seemed a slight departure from the normal Raymond character.If there's a God in heaven, someone will take these books and turn them into a fantastic dramatic TV series - along the lines of Showtime's ""Soul Food"". Raymond, Basil, Yancey B., Jared, Nicole, Peaches, and all the others would be wonderful to watch."
2,He could and has done better,"I only hope that E. Lynn Harris has done a better job of investing his money from his previous books than he has done writing this one. I read and waited for this book to get better..it never did. I have been a fan of E. Lynn Harris and his books since the very beginning, but this book was a major disappointment. It lacked depth and a serious story line.The new characters were weak, had no backbone and it was full of ""fluff"". Mr. Harris should not underestimate the IQ level of his devoted readers, most of us are looking for substance, not a world filled with Cristal Champagne and Palm Pilots."
2,"E. Lynn, I'm a bit disappointed!","E. Lynn, where is the fire, the passion, that special something that you've delivered to us in the past? I'm bout'tired of Ava and Yancey. Raymond needs to get a real life. Can't we say good-bye to Basil? But I still love you E. Lynn!"
1,Over it,Ok I'm starting to get over the same old stuff from ELH. And believe me I have been a devoted fan since his first book...he needs to give his loyal fan base much more than the seemingly formulaic crap that we've gotten lately. Don't mean to be so hard but the theme & characters are just plain tired now. We don't need to read anything else about Yancey B's old evil vindictive mom; nor about the never ending cat & mouse game between Raymond & Basil (just hook up for peet's sake!) and what was up with that weak subplot with Raymond getting shot?????The challenge for ELH is to continue to engage his loyal fan base with new fresh story lines & characters.
5,"Indeed, still the best!","A few months ago I was clearing up my attic and found the old book. I love fitness, and have done it for ages, but my arms and legs invariably DO bulk, whatever the experts say and whatever method I use! Must be genetics, I have very strong musculature.I always ended up a lot fitter, but not fitting my dresses and blouses anymore... So I started Callanetics again, and the results are great! Also, I'm no longer bored with the exercises, as I was long ago!Is Callan P. still active, do any of you know that?? I'd love a new DVD!"
4,Callanetics:10 years younger in 10 hours,My massage therapist recommended this to me. I used her book until I bought a copy. I am in my 60's and wanted to do some exercises. Many in here we use to do in our PE classes in the 1960's. Since it works large muscles and you stop for a couple of weeks due to a trip or being sick you can go back at the same level you were doing before.I was surprised. I have exercised most of my early life and I like these.They are easy to do.The book has different levels and you just work at your own pace which includes exercises for folks with back problems as well as for older folks .
4,callanetics,I had the tape yaers ago. I lost the the tape and decided to get the book. this a good all over body exerise. You won't reget getting it. I like mine.
3,Callanetics,Great techniques. It's harder than it looks to do the moves but it gives you results.This is a good companion book to the DVD as it's much easier to see how it's done watching the DVD.
4,Great songwriter,"I picked this CD up used from a bookstore because the cover artwork intrigued me, and what I found inside was surprisingly good, especially the intelligent, saterical lyrics. In the liner notes, Masters references that this is his his second CD, although I have not been able to find his first CD, Fiction, anywhere on Amazon."
4,this diet works,"While the Lean for Life Diet is a regimented one, it is very easy to follow if you read the book. The book is written in easy to understand language and provides lots of examples."
3,It was alright.,"its not the best book in the world but is well written. talking about WWII and all the strugles the resistance went through to infrom all the people of the danger, the germans were causeing."
5,A solid introduction to fundamental letter forms,"This two-volume set is one of the most user-friendly calligraphy books available. It contains a good reference volume, with plenty of rich details about the history and function of various hands, and also contains a useful workbook to help guide the student towards mastery of various letterforms.The art of calligraphy is one with long history and great usefulness. If only more books made the practice more accessible. This two-volume set is one of the most user-friendly calligraphy books available.

If only more books made the practice more accessible. A valuable introduction."
3,Use EQ to improve sound.,"When I first connected these speakers to my PC I was disappointed. The bass was overpowering the midrange and treble. I did some tuning using the equalizer in Windows Media Player and the sound is greatly improved. Real Player, Winamp Player, and others have tone controls or equalizers also. Use the players help screen to find the option. Ipod players also feature equalization. Enjoy."
3,Not bad,"I have had a set of these speakers for over 5 years. I bought them only because the new LCD monitor I bought had no internal speakers and I needed some kind of sound. They were one of the least expensive speakers available where I bought them. I'm telling you, these are decent speakers for less than $20 at a retail store. I was impressed when I got them. Since then I have gotten iTunes and iPod and play music on my computer while I work and they work good. I would suggest using a music player with EQ controls so you can adjust the levels that sound best for you."
2,Of limited value to the conscientous cyclist,"I can't really recommend this book. While it's filled with very good equipment and car-free lifestyle choices, the riding techniques advocated are highly dubious. In some cases, they're illegal and stupid -- like showing you how to run red traffic lights, or riding on the sidewalk -- and will do nothing for the image of cyclists. The book even shows (by a backhanded warning) the best place to crack a car windshield.It is a shame that such moments of crassness spoil a book that is aimed at beginners. These would be bad habits to get into, and terrible things to learn from the outset.Better books on assertive cycling are John Franklin's ""Cyclecraft"", and John Forester's ""Effective Cycling"". They show you how to gain your place in the traffic, and how to keep it without resorting to crazy stunts."
5,An excellent guide to urban biking,"It is about time that there is a book available to city bikers. The book really looks at those ""interesting"" traffic situations that one encounters in the city. All the tricks and tips that Dave shows us are invaluable. From fitting your helmet and dressing for a ride to lubing your gears and chain. One thing, I really liked was the non-violent ways he shows us when dealing with the no so nice people out there. He always encourages us to get back on and ride.It is truly a useful and informative guide to biking in an urban setting."
3,if you're new to bicycles it has a few decent sections,"It's not worth buying. You can read the entire thing in about an hour. Get it at the library if you feel you must. You'll thank me for this advice.The ""dangerous"" parts that everybody else is offended by aren't really that bad. The part that stuck out at me as completely wrongheaded was the section on getting an insurance settlement after a crash. The mistakes are too numerous to list. Don't follow the advice in that chapter, just talk with a lawyer."
1,Not recomended,"At best this book is incomplete and at worst it is downright dangerous. Recommending that a rear light is not needed for night riding is foolish especially given how inexpensive and good today's bike lights are. My advice get at least one light for each side of your bike. White light for the front, red for the back, and amber wheel lights for the sides. Two lights or more for each side is even better. Get the brightest lights you can afford. Reflectors just don't cut it.Get towed by cars or pick a fight with a driver if you want to die on your bike. It's a small twitch of the wrist or foot for a driver to put you in the hospital. Bike commuting can be safe and fun but you must be smart and careful. This book should have covered all the basics of interacting with traffic safely. It glosses over the basics and then shows you a bunch of dumb stunts that are likely to get you hurt."
2,disappointing,"Skip this book. There is not much valuable information, and a few too many bad suggestions. Additionally, text/page layout is cluttered and irritating to look at and try to glean what the author is actually trying to say. A waste of money."
4,"A summary of ""Effective Cycling""","I disagree with the 1 star reviews. This book has a lot of good advice. I found it to be easier to get at than the tome,Effective Cycling: 6th Edition. Yes you should use your own judgement when riding in a city. Situation awareness, it's key to staying alive. I've been riding for longer than this book has been in print by far, so I'm not somebody who just discovered cycling.I bought this book for my kid, who wouldn't plow through Forester's book. It has most of what they needed to know, and it's in a graphical style which explains why he recommends what he does and it's easy to understand."
4,Regular Person,"This is a very good book for basic to advanced painters. The beginner will find easy step-by-step lessons as well as excellent chapters on color mixing and composition. The book begins with basic paintings that can all be completed in 45 minutes or less with the second half of the book getting into more detailed techniques. Maybe the colors could be a little brighter but the printed pictures show good detail for brush strokes and the ""how-to"" steps to get started painting a niece landscape painting."
1,"First Bob Ross, now wash-dross, watercolours in /acrylic/feathers/cement...whatever,","""Anyone can paint"" writes Mr Fenwick, instantly and enthusiastically disproving this statement with his own lacklustre compositions. Those among you familiar with Mr Fenwick's tv show ""The Art Doctor"" will find the quotation: ""Physician, heal thyself."" all too fitting. Yet another book of formulaic nonsense aimed at those individuals believing they have some latent artistic ability ready to be unleashed upon the world. Sadly, most don't. This book will do nothing to change that."
4,Great Rapid Start! Not a substitute for disciplined study!,"Just wanted to second the review of this book by Pat Hopper. I went through this book in a week or two and couldn't have gotten a better start to reading thai. The best thing about the book is that it starts with the Low Consonants, then the Middle, and then introduces the Common High Class Consonants concurrently with the concept of tone rules. This approach keeps the three classifications of consonants seperate in the students mind as opposed to the student that begins by learning the alphabet in dictionary order.That said, the book is very sketchy, should use the common ""AH! AH EE! EE EU! EU"" Thai vowel table, and a clear tone table as in David Smyth's ""Teach Yourself Thai.""For me this book was a great introduction, and now that I'm studying a more disciplined course (similar to one Thai children receive in 1st and 2nd grades) I'm learning at faster rate, and filling in the holes and ambiguity that Easy Thai left me with."
2,Is there such a thing as Easy Thai?,"The answer to the question in the header definitely is ""No, there is no such thing""! So, do not think you will learn much more from this book than sentences like ""In Lamphoon there are rice farmers"". These sentences are not really the first you would like to know when you plan to visit Thailand. Nevertheless you have to start somewhere, and this book is good as a first acquaintance with the (very complex) Thai language.I used it before I went to Thailand for the very first time, and it did teach me a bit of the Thai alphabet and some basic things like counting (useful in bargaining). The title will always remain misleading, as I know now (after several years of harsh study) that there definitely is no such thing as ""Easy Thai""!Neverthless recommended to give learning the Thai language a first try."
1,"terrible, just terrible","If you want to learn Thai, you can find much much better books than this. The printing quality is very bad, so that the subtleties of Thai letters are totally lost. The vocabulary is weird indeed -- not the sort of words you will use. I suggest getting the Teach Yourself series' Thai book. Better yet, go to Thailand.Seconds to all comments from the reader from Osaka who writes below."
3,A systematic approach to learning consonants and vowels,The strength of this book is the way it gradually builds on the Thai alphabet. The vocabulary words seem to be chosen not because of their usefulness but because they offer simple examples of how the characters and vowels work.
5,Childhood book found,I read this book as a child and have been looking for a copy of it for years. I finally found it and received it in mint condition and in a timely manner. Well done.
5,STARZ Rocks !,"The 1st Starz album I picked up was their 1978 release""Coliseum Rock"", only on the strength of the cover,loved the album as one of the few a** kickin' albums of the era.Subsequently sought out the other albums'""Violation"",a futuristic concept album w/some hard rockers most notably,""Subway Terror"",about a drugged up psycho terrorizing the underground labrynths of theNY subway.The next album was,""Attention Shoppers"",which has a pop feel but also has some really cool songs like,""X-ray Specs""(I can see right through you baby !).Finally brings me to strangely enough my last Starz acquisition,which is their 1stalbum, which is being reviewed here.This album is arguably the guy's best & has them soundly beating their label mates Kiss @ their own game,not to mention one of the coolest album covers in the history of hard rock ! If you can't find their stuff go to starzcentral.com & all the CD's are there + more."
4,Neil Bradley Owen - Front Porch Prose,Neil Bradley Owen is a genuine heartfelt singer/songwriter of the first degree. Instantly memorable original melodies and lyrics. Give it a spin.
4,GOOD OLD FASHIONED CHICK-LIT,The book revolves around two women with problematic lives. They are client and lawyer who have love relationship woes---the story goes back and forth between the two flawlessly.Lynn's husband has fallen out of love with her and moves on with another woman. The other woman's husband contacts Lynn and thereby hangs a tale.Renee (I too pronounced it Ren-nay for easy reading flow)is the lawyer Lynn seeks out--she too ultimately has marital woes along with step daughter problems.This is a good way to spend a few hours with an interesting read that makes you thankful for your own home and hearth.In the end the good guys win and the bad guys lose and all is right with the world
1,Poor,If you are into puzzles this is the box for you. I would not recommend this product as it falls apart very easily and is not worth the aggravation of constantly putting back together.
4,Great little firewood box,I bought a brown one of these locally and it snapped together securely. seems sturdy and is a great little firewood box for my fire ring area. I have a larger firewood rack but it's a ways away from where my fire ring/outdoor entertainment area is. nice to have a good sturdy box to hold some wood close by and keep it dry.
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this one. I was hoping that it was a cartoon with moving cartoon-istry?. But it was just a book, (still pictures)."
1,Job not completed. Cannot use at all.,"Length:: 1:35 MinsThis is a video of a set of Hooker Headers I received from Amazon. Now I have to admit, the shipping was blazing, ordered them on Sep 22 and received the item on September 24. Can't beat that except for what you will see in the video. The tubes that meet in the passenger side collector flange were not welded shut to create a seal. If I had put these on my car, I would have wasted my time and they would not have worked. That was disappointing to say the least. Set me back a few more days.....buyer beware!"
5,LIKE OLD HOMES BUT BUILDING NEW? THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK.,"Planning to design and build a new home that appears old is no easy task. After owning homes as old as 160 years old, we decided to build a home with all the character of something old but with all the benefits of new. Russell Versaci writes a tremendous text explaining briefly the do's and don'ts, why's and how's. A visit to his architecture firm's website shows some of his other projects. A talented architect, and now a talented author. These homes are not cheap to design and build. I was quoted by architects listed in the book that to build a home designed to their level of detail can run $300-$400/ sq.ft. including design fees. An individual attempting to build such a home will no doubt hire an architect. This book will provide important references, and stimulate ideas, while working with your architect and builder.Tampa, FL"
3,Picture Book,This is a pretty picture book. It is not to be used as a reference book as I expected. It shows new homes that were built to look old and it tells what they did for that particular home. It does not give information on how to make your home look old or what details to add.
3,Nice but not what I expected.,"It's a nice book if you are expecting a general overview of renovated houses,one in each of several architectural types. I had expected more detail about renovating any style of old house."
1,Nothing more than an expensive advertisement...,...for a bunch of architects...lots of pretty pictures but no useful information -- e.g. sources...diagrams are too small and general to be of any use...they should be paying the buyer to read their ads -- not vice-versa!
3,Ok,Saw the book mentioned in Southern Living magazine. I had higher expectations. I thought it would have some of the same pictures and plans as those in the magazine.
2,Best picture is on the cover...,"Pictures were too small and the book covered too many kinds of ""new"" old houses. The cover made me think of Williamsburg... but the content did not.Farm houses, Spanish colonials, praire style, etc. with just glimpses of staircases or open doors... etc. Just not what I needed for my Williamsburg style home."
4,I love this book...,"The pictures are wonderful, and the ideas for building new houses that look old are great. You would be hard pressed to believe the houses in this book aren't antiques! The house plans and write up of each house are a nice feature."
3,Beware XP users,"I was very happy with the speed, ease, and quality of the b&w and color prints this machine was producing. Once the USB cable was installed, the initially sluggish scanner was whirring right along. So far, so good. Then I upgraded to the very fine and stable Windows XP. Lo and behold, my Lexmark Z82, purchased just months before from a premier imaging outfit, was one of the few multi-machines that wasn't compatible. The patch fix offered at the Lexmark site didn't work...so, I've offered this fine machine to my son (and his Windows ME cpu,) and I've ended up getting the very fine (and a bit more costly) HP PSC750.If XP is not -- and will never be -- in your future, then give the X82 a try. Trouble is, I think you'll find Microsoft's new o/s irresistible. I don't know what Lexmark's product development and marketing teams were thinking."
3,gasket,part ordered arrived promptly and was very well packaged. Would use again for future purchases. Thanks for good service.
1,Seroka adrift,"As a singer, Henri Seroka was romantic, passionate and skilful. Now he has his own sound studio and the chance to create any sort of music he likes, he has sadly descended into soundscape triteness. ""Cosmic Angels,"" by and large, is smooth electronic wallpaper. There are moments and pauses where an apt phrase could lift it into loveliness, but banality wins out every time. The wallpaper is bland enough for background effect and therefore will have its uses. Sadly, the final track requires drum-machine and over-emphasis to end on an up-beat note, and is simply annoying. After hearing the CD once, you will probably program your machine to play tracks 1 to 4 only."
4,God's light shines brightly in Brian Littrell!,Brian's solo album is a blessing and his passion for God shines so brightly on this album! He could have turned to non christian music but instead stayed close to his heavenly father!Contemporary songs mixed with songs of praise for God and jesus make for one fantastic album! If you are christian I think you will love it and even if you are NOT a believer in God you will STILL enjoy it! Fantastic!
5,Excellent surprise from a boy band member,This album is very soothing to listen to. All the songs are wonderful with meaningful lyrics. There is no reason to skip tracks on this one!
4,What a pleasant surprise!,"I received this CD for Christmas and I didn't even recognize the name Brian Littrell until someone told me that he was a former Backstreet Boys. I took it at face value and listened to see how he was as a solo artist. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the whole CD is a Contemporary Christian album which made me especially glad since I am a Christian. I was very impressed by the lyrics and thoughtfulness of each song. Notably Joy Williams and Mark Harris co-wrote on a couple of songs. Overall, I thought this album was great and it's a great addition in the Christian music market!"
4,Brian's Voice is Wonderful,"Brian was always my favorite Backstreet Boy because he has such a beautiful voice, which is why I was so very excited to hear he was coming out with a solo album. This album is great! It is nice to have some good Christian artists since most of the mainstream artists these days have absolutely no morals whatsoever.Update: I saw him perform songs from this album at Disney's Night of Joy in the Magic Kingdom and it is even more wonderful in person!"
5,CD was in excellent condition,I order this because this CD is out of print very hard to find.. I was unsure i would get it because the price was really cheap.. it came very quickly and in excellent condition ..I will buy from them again.
3,Why Can't You Come Home,"""Why Can't You Come Home"" was a fun, catchy tune. Aisde from that, nothing that X-Girlfriend did was that memorable. Perhaps due to promotion, or lack of it. My suggestion is to buy the CD for ""Why Can't You Come Home"", as you aren't going to find it elsewhere. But don't expect much else from the CD."
2,Not enough instruction...,As a beginner I found the DVD to be quite light on tips or the art of playing in general. There are questions from the audience (probably about 6 or seven questions in total!) interspersed with Wilkerson actually playing with a band. It might be more useful if you are interested in watching and hearing him play.
5,I love this CD,"I have never really known another S'express fan but I love them. This is a vocal-house CD that definitely has kind of a throwback feel to disco. Not that it's disco, because it's not. But if I had to guess, these guys were probably influenced by the 70's style disco. I'm not totally sure who to compare this to... the closest I listen to myself might be like 2 Unlimited, but this is much lighter and less driving than 2U... like I said, it's a little bit discoey. Discoey vocal house. I love it, anyhow."
2,Not the quality I expected,"Each bag has three sachets: one in chiffon that you can use to insert in the bathtub and two refills. There is a mix of soap and plants in every sachets. Soap gets mushy and there's just not enough plants for a bathtub. It is not easy to clean the chiffon sachet and put the refills in it. Bottom line: While when I purchased the product I thought this is a great idea for the price, I find the combination of soap and chamomile unfortunate, the whole setup is not easy to use and in the end it is not worth the price."
1,broke 1st time I wore it!!!,"I wore the shoe today, felt very comfortable when I put it on. But in the afternoon, I noticed bits and pieces of black plastic/rubber on the floor which I traced to my shoe's heel. The heel has cracked and small pieces of rubber from the heel have scattered all over the floor. This is very embarrassing and I am very disappointed with this purchase. This item is a negative rating!!!!!"
3,first timer,"I'd never heard of low temp solder before the last few weeks. It works a little less well than I'd read. the price seemed high and the shipping cost was ridiculously high, I would look for another source when this runs out."
5,The best Geils Album,"This album was the last of the J Geils classic, thought provoking lyrics, with somewhat dark but very enjoyable tunes. It was after this album that the band turned to pop music. Once a party band with a tremdous amount of energry, the Geils band channeled their energy to powerful lyrics with a hard, but refined sound. They still would throw in a fun party tune, but they redefined themselves after this album as a pop band. This is the best of the Geils albums."
5,J GEILS ROCKS U.S.A. #1,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PARTY ALBUMS EVER! FROM START TO FINISH IT JAMS. THE MUSIC & VOCALS BLEND IT IS J GEILS AT THERE VERY BEST. HOW ABOUT A REUNION?
3,"Beware, its only video signal that it detects","I wanted to use this for iPOD input and my mp3 player input and the output goes to a home theater system. If I play videos on my iPOD, this auto switch works fine. But if I play music alone, then it stays at input 1. So, detection of signals for auto switch is based only on the video line and NOT the audio line. This was not very apparent in the description"
4,"Does the job, works just fine!","Purchased this today, and after reading the instructions proceeded to hook up my Playstation 2, Wii, Hitachi Hi-Fi VCR, and Motorola digital TV box using good quality RCA cables. Output from the switcher box was coax RF out set to channel 3.Pros:1) Picture and sound quality were very close to having the components connected directly to the TV.2) Automatic switching was quick with minimal noise.3) RF output appears to be a superior quality than the Motorola DTV box.4) S-video in/outs.5) Fairly inexpensive for the quality thus-far.Cons:1) Suction cups are indeed a bit on the weak side. Recommend securing cables.2) Audio is indeed stereo from the RCA outputs, but Mono from the RF output (typical).All-In-All, this is a worthy purchase if you have alot of components. The auto switching is a nice feature, and so far it does a good job. No need for remotes.EDIT:It's been over 7 months, and so far so good! Hasn't missed a beat yet!"
5,AV Switch,"I needed additional A/V inputs to accomodate 2 video games, 1 video iPod docking station, and 1 A/V reciever in to 1 input on my TV since all the other 5 were taken. This product is perfect it connected easily, and switches between inputs automatically.If multiple A/V inputs are on it selects the lowest input number input to send to the TV. At less than $30.00 it is a great investment, and has worked perfectly since I set it up. If you nPod dockeed more inputs for your TV this is the product to buy.Since I purchased this years ago it has found new life with my new LCD TV. Since the new TV's only has 1 composite input (RCA left, right, and video), but 6 HDMI inputs.So I can still use my old DLO iPod dock, VCR, DVD, and PS2."
1,Dead On Arrival,"This was dead on arrival, and I could understand why... it's made out of cheap plastic that felt like it was ready to fall apart in my hands."
4,Great product,Performs as advertised. Video switching is smooth and fast. Works great with audio home theater systems.
2,Works great when it works,Purchased mine from Walmart. The selector seems to have problem staying tuned to the right channel. Screen starts to flicker and then goes completely dark even when there's only a single source. If there are two or more signals coming in it doesn't know what to do. Changing to manual mode is not so easy either.
4,Works as advertised,"I installed this for my uncle who gets confused about running the VCR, DVD player and Digital TV converter. With this unit, there is one thing less to worry about. All that needs to be done is turn on the TV, and the machine that you want to watch. No more having to switch cables or check for the correct setting of a manual switch. The video quality is excellent using the S-Video input of the TV set and the S-Video outputs of the VCR, DVD player and DTV converter. The only problem this unit has (and why it didn't get 5 stars) is that the base is not substantial enough, so the unit flips over on it's back from the weight of the connecting cables. While it doesn't look good, this does not affect how the unit operates, so I still recommended buying this device."
4,Works as advertised,"What I really needed was an rf modulator, the switching was a bonus that has been useful. Works fine. The rubber suction cups can't cope with the weight of attached cables. I just laid it on it's side."
3,Looking for a better life,"Fatou is about a very young and beautiful girl that feels she should not be living in provert in Africa due to her being so beautiful. Instead she feels that she should instead be privy to the finer things in life.Fatou learns that she's going to America to finish her studies, so she is excited. Finally she will go to America and live the life she has always dreamt of having.In America she lives with ""Uncle"" Lama. She's thrown into a situation she has no control over.Even though she is only 17 years old, she is wise beyond her years. She learns about living life on the streets and is no longer the timid young girl from Africa and is feared by many. Is this the life for Fatou?"
4,hott,"This book was good. At first I thought the book was wack, because the cover wasn't that appealing but after reading the book i couldn't put it down. This book is crazy. A must read."
2,Cheaply made,"I knew it was a cheap grill when I bought it (obviously).Pros: It's a charcoal grill and can cook things.Cons: Rusted completely through the bottom in less than a year. Spend the extra $15 and get a Weber, because you'll need to buy one anyway in about 9 months. Would work OK if you are planning to store this inside most of the time and only use it on certain occasions (like tailgates), otherwise the weather will kill it before long."
3,Did not use it because one leg of the grill was missing,We received the grill on time but without one leg. Had to return it and never bought the same thing again.
5,Surprises Galore,"The book was great! I really enjoyed every moment of it. There were surprises around every corner. The characters were very well developed and some were even likable. There is a great protagonist and several antagonists that round out the ensemble. I definately recommend this book. I would read it again, if I hadn't just read it."
4,Photo description of a beautiful country,"The nation of South Africa is one of the most beautiful in the world. With a wide variety of geological features, both warm and cold water ocean beaches, one of the world's greatest varieties of flora and fauna, a rich agricultural base and some of the most barren land in the world, it doesn't lack for variety. This book is a series of pictures of the country with a short description of what is in the photo. The focus is on the scenery although a bit of history is included to complete the descriptions.South Africa is a nation that has undergone a dramatic political change in the last decade. I once had the opportunity to attend the first joint U.S./South Africa joint conference on education and turned it down. I have regretted it ever since and have had to be content with looking through books about South Africa. In looking through this one, it is clear that if I had gone, I would have been strongly tempted to stay there."
1,"Opened item mailed to me, twice!","I am very disappointed with this product. Based on other people's review, I bought two of this set. Unfortunately, when they arrived Friday and Wednesday in separate amazon boxes, both packages are opened. What I mean here is the factory seals were broken. Inside, both have scratches. It seems to me Amazon sold the ""returned items"" to me. I have been Amazon's customers many years, this is the first time. Yes, I paid $270 for these opened box bathroom shower set!"
4,Nice and solid,"I like the look and feel - the shower head started leaking slightly. Probably just have to reattach the head, but I expected this product to be flawless"
2,Not a very good album,"I think that Starz's third release Attention Shoppers! is their weakest album cause I think that almost all of the songs are somewhat unfocused and the songwriting tends to get lazy cause when it comes to the third chorus, they don't want to finish it, they would rather get halfway through the third chorus and start a fading chorus, and I was kind of dissapointed in it and you think that the whole song would be good but unfortunately it only gets weak, the only songs that are worth having for the album is Hold on to the Night and She, the rest of the songs are forgettable and luckily their next album Coliseum Rock is quite an improvement, if you're new to the band Starz, start with their Greatest Hits CD or Coliseum Rock (their final album) which I think should've been a classic like their debut although I haven't listened to Violation and I would be interested in how good that album would be."
3,Luke's Mom,"Like some of the other reviewers stated, this stroller is good for the price but has its drawbacks. I am only 5'2"" and even I kick the back wheels when walking behind it and find myself having to lean forward to avoid this. The storage isn't that great either but I guess it is fine for a sippy cup and snack - as long as you are just going for a short walk around the block and don't need to cart around the typical baby gear (wipes, diapers, etc...). My son is small for his age and fits just fine but there is not a 5-point harness on it so he does lean forward quite a bit when he wants to get out."
5,Perfect umbrella stroller.,"We bought this stroller for our international flights as we did not want to carry our bulky bugaboo, and it does its job perfectly. Honestly, we started to prefer using it frequently because the bugaboo is not very practical."
2,Snap goes the handle,"Handle snapped clean off at the rivet leaving us stranded on vacation, only had it for a month or so. Never could figure out how to effectively use the sun canopy. We had high hopes..."
4,Awsome Stroller!,"I love this stroller. It is in between those cheap umbrella strollers and those huge infant strollers. It is so easy to stroll, light weight, and the handles are at a great height. I think it is a wonderful stroller for the price. Things I would change: The back sits too straight and the umbrella needs to be larger."
2,An ok stroller with a few flaws,"We bought this stroller over a year ago and I never used the canopy because it was awkward and it's so narrow that it didn't block the sun from my daugher's eyes. I would agree with others that the seat is also narrow. My daughter is now 2 and a half and it's getting tight for her shoulders. We were recently on a trip and while we were in the airport, the foot strap (for the child to rest their feet on) just broke off. Now we have to buy a new stroller because she has to hold her feet up. While it was ok until now, I will not buy this stroller again."
2,Jeep Wrangler Review,"Overall, I'm disappointed with the Jeep Wrangler umbrella stroller. I bought the stroller for my 15 month old daughter. The seat area is too narrow. She looks uncomfortable. I was disappointed that the stroller did not come with a five point harness. My daughter slumped forward with her head between her legs when she was taking a nap. That incident did it for me...the stroller is going back. I plan on replacing it with the Chico umbrella stroller."
2,okay back up stroller,"We bought this stroller b/c we were trying to downsize as our son was nearing two yrs and we were taking a vacation and wanted something easier to travel with. We liked the style especially the canopy, as many umbrella strollers don't have these. Also the handles seemed much higher than the other strollers which was nice being that I am 5'7 and my husband is 6'0. We were very disappointed though. As someone else mentioned there is very little room to walk behind it. We were constantly tripping over the wheels, not very fun for us or I'm sure my son either. Another problem was that my son is on the tall side, and if he took his feet off the foot rest(which he did constantly) his feet could touch the floor and they would drag i was afraid they would get caught under the stroller! Needless to say, we took our old stroller on vacation with us and this one is in my husbands vehicle as a back up!"
3,"pretty stroller, not enough room for a 2 yr old.","the new pink jeep stroller is sooo cute, but theres not enough room for a 2 year old.i would only recommend this for babies from the age of 5 months to 18 months.i like everything about it except for the small seat area,if it were a few inches wider and deeper, it would be great."
2,"Andrea Searcy, Fairburn, GA, USA","This stroller looks great, the weight and height is perfect. However, I must say that this stroller is entirely too narrow. My son was 14 months old at the time I made the purchase. When I placed him in the stroller, he looked as if I squeezed him in and he's not over weight. I also didn't like that this stroller does not recline. This product needs improvement.I was able to find an umberlla stroller made by Chicco at a great price. My son is comfortable in it and he's 18 months old now! It has every thing I wanted in an umbrella stroller. It is light weight, it reclines, the height is perfect, it has a basket for storage, a pack and strap bag, a sun visor, awsome safty features, and it is not narrow, I love it!"
1,CUTE LOOK BUT TOO SMALL!!!,"I bought this stroller for my 18 month old son. We already own the 3-wheeler all terrain jeep stroller and were so pleased with it and decided to buy this one for our smaller car. I returned it after a week. The seat is too small and my son was always crunched in. It folds easily and I was really sad to give it up but I need something that I can use for more than a month!! I also noticed that I would find myself kicking the tires as all the other parents have said. I am only 5'2 so I don't think its a ""tall person"" thing."
4,Good Enough,"We purchased the stroller with the idea of taking it out of the country with us. We were looking for something smaller and lighter than our largest stroller. We read the reviews and took a chance.Overall, it meet our expectations. It is lighter and smaller. The back vent is great. Our daughter had no problems with the seat depth as others have complained about. The only complaint I have is the height of the handles. I am taller than my wife and found it difficult to walk behind it without kicking the back axle. I ended up walking along side it and using one hand to steer. Not too bad because we mainly used it for short distances, but I can see it getting frustrating for longer walks."
3,Great Stroller Frame - TERRIBLE Handles,"This stroller is built very sturdy and lives up to the Jeep off road name - HOWEVER, the handles are way to short for me (I am 5'8) and my husband (who is 6'2). We end up with terrible aches in our backs after pushing this stroller for about 20 minutes because you have to hunch over to push it. Also, we are constantly kicking the wheels because you are having to stand so close to the stroller. If it had longer handles, I would give this stroller a 5."
4,pretty good stroller,"I agree with some of the reviewers... the seat is pretty small. I thought my babies would be okay, because they are small for their age (1 and 2), but the seat is just a bit too narrow. They still fit fine, and can sleep in it, too. Other than the narrow seat, the stroller is great. I love the easy to clean fabric, and the wheels have yet to get stuck anywhere. I have owned a ton of strollers, and this is the best for the money."
4,Great stroller for the price,"I purchased this stroller at Babies R Us for about $30. But we have the version with the yellow trim. I was actually surprised at how well made it was for the price. Very sturdy and sharp looking. Lightweight and easy to push , even when the baby insists on being held and I have to push this with one hand. I like that the canopy isn't as high up on the handles as some of the other strollers, much more effective I think.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't have anywhere to place storage."
2,Not a good product for taller parents,"My husband and I are over 5'10"" and this stroller does not work well for us. When pushing the stroller, we are hunched over because the handles are too low. We are constantly kicking the wheels when pushing the stroller because wheel-base is too narrow. My recommendation would be to make sure you test drive this stroller in the store before you purchase it!"
1,Too small!,"I own the larger Jeep stroller and love it. I was looking for something to replace my small umbrella stroller and thought that I had found the perfect match! Not so!!! I had read the reviews about people complaining about the seat size and ignored them. I shouldn't have! My son is not quite 2 and barely fit in this one. His little behind would hang off the seat, which made it easy for him to try to get out. Fortunately, I was able to return it to the store and got a regular umbrella stroller that fits our needs much better. (and was less expensive) I would listen better to the other comments about the size."
4,"Great stroller, except...","I love this stroller for many of the same reasons other people have listed. My only problem with it is the folding. I followed the instructions for folding it up, closing the canopy first, but when I pulled it out for the next use, the canopy was bent into a peak. I tried bending it back the best I could, and now I unclip one side of the canopy before folding it up to prevent more bending of the frame. I wrote the manufacturer, but have heard nothing back. I don't know if other people have had this problem, but be careful when you fold it up!"
3,Excellent choice for a 25pound or less baby.,"Originally I bougth this stroller for my 38 pounds, 3 yr. old son. The minute I finished setting it up I knew it was really small and not wide enough for him, so he could barely sit. The stroller is handy, lightweight and strong, I do highly recommend it for smaller babies or those who weight less than 25 pounds."
2,Not built for a toddler,"My son is 2 1/2 and he looked absoultely silly in this stroller - it was WAY too small for a 2 year old! Cool design, but that's about it!"
2,"constanly tripping on wheels, no good for anyone over 5'2""","My husband is 6 foot tall and there is no way he can push this stroller. It seems like no one took it out for a trial when they designed this. The handles are too short and the back wheels seem like they are too close together. Neither I nor my husband can push this without hitting our feet on the wheels, and I'm only 5'2"". It is so annoying, you have to kind-of try to walk to the side, we are going to have to buy another (better designed)stroller. True it is lightweight and easy to fold up, however the little sidebags don't allow for much storage. It actually does seem durable, but it's not user friendly for pushing, which is what it is supposed to be made to do. Don't waste your money."
3,Third Ear Band - 'The Magus' (Angel Air),"The band's apparent long-lost fourth (?) never before released effort. Likely recorded in 1972, as this effort's seven tracks were carefully preserved my TEB member Ron Kort. Not a bad record at all. Tunes that I sort of liked include ""I The Key"", the eight-minute title track ""The Magus"", the gloomy ""New Horizon"" and spoken-word ""The Phoenix"". Ron Kort also supplied the production, percussion and the piano for 'The Magus' disc. I also thought this CD took Third Ear Band in somewhat of a new direction. Comes with a 16-page CD booklet with band info and never-before seen photos. Believe that the Italian label - Akarma also put this out on vinyl."
1,An exercise in dumbness,"Attila, being one of the greatest metal vocalists in my opinion, must have been kidnapped and drugged to do this sophmore release from Tormentor. It is stupid, sloppy, psuedo-progressive garbage with very little worth or any similarity to what the black metal community knows of the true Tormentor. 95% of the time, they are trying to plagarize Italy's Root while falling flat on their faces at the time. Steer clear of this one boys and girls, and you might be a happier individual."
4,Basic but up-to-date manual for career change,"If you've been downsized or fired, have recently graduated from college or graduate school, or are simply unhappy with your career choices, this book lays out a systematic process for finding a new job - one that you will enjoy and that will fit your abilities. Catherine B. Beck recommends starting with a couple of exercises in self-knowledge. First, create a ""product profile"" of yourself, to help you understand the skills you'll bring to your next position, and then write your ideal job description. She provides detailed advice on setting up a home job-search office, writing a professional-looking resume, surviving the job interview and negotiating a job offer. We recommend this guide to new graduates, employees who want a change and career coaches looking for useful advice to give their clients."
3,cd purchase,"Was looking for mountain folk music like what was on the original Andy Griffith movie. I bought another cd by Andy Griffith and was disappointed to find the same music on this cd only in a different order recorded by a different label. Quality and purchased price were good, but not what I was looking for in this music."
4,"Me, too!!","I, too, always loved Old El Paso relish, and when I found this I was really excited! I went ahead and ordered a case (which I received in 3 days!!). I found it to be as close as I've ever found to Old El Paso. It didn't have the ""kick"" (I really like HOT food), but I found it be a great substitute (after looking for something comparable for about three years). I see there are only three cases left -- do we know if there will be more ordered to keep here at Amazon (for when we need our ""fix""), or does anyone know where we can order directly if and when Amazon quits having it in stock? Thanks again -- first thing I did was fix some Juevos Rancheros (probably spelled that wrong) and they were great!"
1,Not even close,"Casa Fiesta Jalapeno Relish. Boy, did I get suckered. Anyone that thinks this product is even in the same ball park with Old El Paso must have taste buds that belong to the Ancients. I used to mix a can of Old El Paso and a can of Contidina Tomato Sauce for the best hot sauce around. My CASE of Casa Fiesta showed up today and I mixed the two cans. DISASTER! I can't believe I let myself be influenced like that. As the kids say, ""my bad."". Now what am I going to do with eleven cans of ^>*<? Look out,dumpster, here it comes."
5,Great dip recipe!,This relish is sooo yummy made into dip and it is so simple. One can of relish with 1 package of philadelphia cream cheese. Mix well and serve with chips! It is sooo good!
5,A Lost Classic,"I had the original l.p. album from the early 70's. After getting into the age of CD's, it now sounds all scratched and awful after decades of listening to it. I have looked and looked but could never find this album anywhere, until now. I was so glad to get this hard-to-find CD version. Paul was (and is) an extremely talented songwriter. In my view, this was his best album ever. It also included guests Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, and Gerry Beckley (aka ""America""). Paul wrote or co-wrote all the songs on this album except for ""That Lucky Old Sun"" which was a song his father (also Paul Williams) loved. This CD once again brings back fond memories of the early 70's and it sounds great!"
3,Good food to have as a staple.,A good product to carry for those times you have no time. A side veggie dish is recommended.
3,It's a clunker,"I owned an ipaq 3150 for about two months before I decided that it was just too big to be practical. I needed a device that would fit comfortably in my pocket... I guess I figured that I could get by with 16 mb and not need to use the expansion sleeve. But the memory dissappeared rapidly and I discovered how bulky the thing is with the sleeve on. Bulky and heavy. I really enjoyed my use of this PDA, however; the large screen is nice for Ebooks and photos, if you can stand the monochrome display. If you can get by without the sleeve, the PC itself is quite sleek and attractive. I bought it in the first place because it seems less expensive than it's color relatives, but recently prices have plummetted and a thinner machine with a color display is no longer unaffordable."
3,Good for starters...,"This book is OK if your a starter with the MARS product. I found the book to be interesting, though they could have gone into more customization and devices that are not natively supported by the MARS appliance.On the good side, its somewhat better than the useless and incomplete pamphlet that comes with the MARS appliance.But I think the price is a bit high for what your getting."
3,"Atlantic Starr ""Love Crazy""",I really like this CD of course you should be listening with someone you care about. It is very smooth and easy to listen to.I think it is also very romantic music and would consider purchasing this CD
5,Please Read This Book!,"I was stunned to learn from a trusted prayer leader that the division between pastors and intercessors is worldwide. I thought it just existed in my city. That's why I bought the book. I have had quite a lot to learn to understand why the division exists and now see it largely as an issue of control, something the authors point out that God never gave away to either pastors or to intercessors. What an obvious place for the enemy to erect a wall, for we vitally need one another. Together, the power of the church will finally be released. This book is magnificent in its accessibility to a topic that has mystified me. I found it immensely practical. The authors' tenderness and humility show through on every page."
4,Well worth perusing,"The first half of the book is a biography of James Smithson, the Smithsonian's benefactor, although little is really known of him. He was the illegitimate son of an English nobleman in the 18th century, and few records about him survive. It's a mystery why he left his fortune-half a million dollars in that day's currency, equivalent to about $50 million today-to the United States, and there was a lot of debate over whether it should be accepted! Then once it was accepted in theory, there was a significant challenge in physically procuring the money (eventually transported across the Atlantic in the form of gold). And finally, there was much disagreement about how the money should be used and a fair amount of graft and corruption that obliterated the principle. Quite an intriguing story. The book itself is a little too meandering for my tastes; the author tries too hard to fill in the blanks with conjecture and imagination. But well worth perusing."
4,Surprised!,"I actually got a copy of the Love & Energy album last year, but I was surprised to see this as a release from it. There were a few tracks I was hoping to see released also like Want Your Love and Fantasy? When i got a copy of Luv With You, I was again amazed that there were 13 tracks on it (longer than some of my full CDs). My fave cuts on it are tracks 3 and 5. Pretty hard to believe that all the mixes and vocals were done by Randy Lance??? Great job bro."
3,Invisible Man instead of Poe,"This time Amazon's listing is off from what you really get. Be nice if Amazon and BCI could get their signals right with this series. Instead of the listed ""Masterworks of Terror"" you get ""The New Invisible Man"". There has been some talk on a few sites that there were some copyright issues with ""Masterworks"" that kept it from the set. Still, if they had time to correct the cover sleeve you think they'd have time to correct the ordering info. Well ""Night of the Bloody Apes"", ""Wrestling Women Vs. The Aztec Mummy"" and ""Doctor of Doom"" alone make this set worth having. Everything else should be considered bonus even if what you're ordering isn't what you're getting."
5,"Never had a leak, better for the budget","Huggies have always left little gel residue on my kids. Pampers never fit right--they always walked around bow-legged. The store brands usually leaked. But Luvs have been just right. I never believed their commercials, but now that I've tried them, I just have to. Why waste your money on a more expensive diaper when these work great? My kids love to look at Blue and we talk about what he is doing. They smell like baby powder and I love that fresh smell. It helps make the diapering area smell better too."
3,Luvs are too small,Absorbancy is fine but if your child is even close to the high side of the recommended weight for a diaper size buy the next size in Luvs. My daughter was 28lbs and I got size 5's which fit her in every other brand but cut off her circulation in Luvs. My newborn was in Luvs size 2 immediatly and I barely used the last of them before he outgrew them. Their sizing isn't very generous.Other than that they were good
3,STRONG baby powder smell,"wow- when i first opened the box, the smell was overpowering.i figured it would go away, but now when i go into the nursery all i can smell is baby powder from the new diapers.ive used pampers and huggies but wanted a more economical alternative.if the smell doesnt bother you, i think these diapers are perfectly fine.they seem a bit thinner than pampers swaddlers but hold it all in.ive had no problem with leakage as advertised but no where on the packaging does it state that the diapers are scented. not a fan."
4,I Love Luvs,"I used Luvs with my first child, so naturarlly I decided to use them with my second. I have never had a leak problem with Luvs. That's more than I can say for some of the other brands."
3,Received some defective diapers,"My son has been using this diaper for almost a year now. I'm satisfied with it until the latest purchase has 5 defective diapers. It never happened before this. 1 of the diaper has missing tab, another diaper's tab snapped when I pulled it, 3 diapers have their tabs glued together. That's my only complain. Other than that I'm happy with the performance."
1,Stop!!!! Don't buy these crappy diapers!!!,"I bought two boxes of these Luv diapers (thats 448 diapers!) and I sure wish I had spent a little extra for Pampers Swaddlers. These diapers leak out the top because they don't have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist. Even the generic Kroger diapers have elastic waistbands! I am just sad that I have to use these crappy diapers for so long! I also think they run small so I probably will not even use them all. What a waste! The only good thing about these diapers is the price, but, I would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue. P.S. I don't like Huggies either because they leak out the legs! Hard to find a good diaper."
4,A great value & convenience,"This is a great price for Luvs diapers - a bit cheaper than I've found them anywhere else. What makes it an especially good deal is the free shipping. You can get them elsewhere with free shipping, but are required to spend $50. I happen to think Luvs are the best diaper out there - they absolutely don't leak. My son wears one all night long and even though it's full in the morning it still doesn't leak.The reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the Luvs that I got when I placed this order were an older ""model"" without the stretchy sides. The ones wih the ""bear hug stretch"" are a much better fit and seem to be more comfortable. I hope that if I purchase them through Amazon again that the newer Luvs are available."
4,Impressed Only Diaper that did not leak for us,When my son was 6 months he started leaking with Pampers. Then we tried Huggies and he still leaked. Then we tried Luvs and have been using them ever since. Can't beat the price and having them shipped to your door. I wish they had more of a elastic tab but other than that I am happy. Different Diapers work better for different babies because not all babies have the same butt or stomach or thigh size. It really is just a try game. you could always donate the diapers to shelters and Goodwill and Salvation Army if you do not like them. Love Luvs Love Price Love Amazon!
4,good deal,"These diapers do have a scent, but I've found that even the more expensive brands do as well. It certainly wasn't enought to bother me.One thing I think buyers should know is that the tabs aren't stretchy like Pampers. They still worked fine, though, even though my daughter was almost too large for a size 1. I never had any leak problems or anything. It's a good product, especially considering the price, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy this brand again."
4,good purchase,"Good purchase. The only think I don't like about Luvs is that they are a little smaller than other name-brand diapers of the same size, so my son outgrows the sizes a little faster."
5,Back to Luvs again!,"I started using Luvs size one I received as a baby shower gift. I liked them so much (never had a leak) that I used them through size 2. When my twins started to sit and crawl around, I felt bad putting them into a diaper that had no stretch, so I switched to Pampers Cruisers. When I calculated how much money I was spending on diapers (we use 80-90 per week) I changed to the Pampers Baby Dry. Now that Luvs is switching to the stretchy sides, I am definitely going back to Luvs! I don't see much difference between them and Pampers Baby Dry. My guys have never gotten a rash from them either, but I am pretty vigilant with diaper changes.You can't beat the deal from Amazon, either. I always have a supply on hand and don't have to worry about dragging both babies to the store. Plus, I don't waste money buying things I shouldn't when I get to the store. Way to go Luvs and Amazon!!"
4,Worth Buying,I have been purchasing LUVS product size 2 from amazon. To be Honest it really works well. my baby never had problems with this. compared to other top brand products its worth for the money. And free delivery too.LUVS and Amazon has worked well so far for me.
3,Runs small,"we didn't have too many accidents with those, however they run about 1/2 size smaller. if you're between two sizes, go with the bigger one."
3,Used to be more absorbent,"I used Luvs with my daughter when she was born and they did not have the Bearhug Stretch back then, so I didn't really like them because of that. However, I never had a leakage problem nor any blowouts, even though her poo was very runny at the time. When I noticed they redesigned them and added the stretch to them, I decided to give them another try. I was very disappointed to see that they are not as absorbent as they used to be. My daughter saturates them after only one urination. This never happened before and it certainly doesn't happen with Pampers Baby Dry or Huggies. These are cheaper, but I would have to change diapers more often so I end up spending the same amount of money if I use Pampers or Huggies.It seems that in order to add the Bearhug Stretch and maintain the diapers's low price, they had to use less amount of absorbent material."
1,"Leaky, and Yucky",I bout a case of these because my baby was going up a size and thought I would stock up on the next size. I have never used Luvs before and thought I would give them a try. They are AWFUL!!! They leaked and I would NEVER dream of letting her go all night with one of these on. Just bad diapers. You would be better off with Store Brand diapers or something...anything else!
1,Poo Poo,"I must agree, LUVS let the poo goo out! They absorb pee just fine, but the messy poo seepage stinks!!! If I wanted to clean poop out of the carpet, carseats etc I would have opted for the reuseable diapers.... but I want to throw the mess in the trash where it goes.... not along with my little ones clothes! I have 3 kids and have found that any brand works better... I prefer Cottontails Giant brand or Playskool which I can only find at CVS...Then again... LUVS work just fine for those who expect that poo was meant to goo...."
2,Luvs leak...,"We'd been using Pampers since our daughter was born, since we'd been told ""Pampers are the best!"" But after six months of stretching the budget, we decided we'd try Luvs to save a bit of money. I was very hopeful after reading all the positive reviews.Unfortunately, however, Luvs did not work for our daughter. She had a leak within a day of starting to wear the Luvs diapers. The diaper simply did not absorb the urine quickly enough, and the pee just ran out the back of her diaper as she was lying down. She'd never had a leak with Pampers. Since I had purchased the value pack, I continued to use the Luvs (but only during the day, and not during naptime) -- but we had two more major leaks before we finally ran out of the Luvs diapers and went back to Pampers again.Clearly, other people have found success with Luvs, but I just wanted to share our experience. I'd personally rather spend the extra money on Pampers to be sure that my daughter is wearing a diaper that won't leak..."
1,Luv's Leak,"This is my first experience with Luv's. I will never buy them again. they are too tight around the legs, and too loose around the waist, no matter how you fasten them. They guarantee leak proof, and around the legs, I haven't had a problem. However, I have had seven severe leaks at the waist, especially overnight.Going back to Pampers."
2,Luvs,"The Elastic part is tape and my husband accidetly stuck it to our daughters legs. When I changed her diapr next she screamed because the tape was on her leg not the diaper. This could happen to anyone, nd I'm sure it's not good for a new baby's skin."
1,It's awful. don't buy it.,"[...]I also tries LUVs and found out the quality is very poor. They are very thin, and the smell is too strong. It's also smaller compare to Huggies or Kirkland brand. My eight months old baby, barely fits in size 5. To make matter worse, they don't have gigalistic waist. I bought this because of other reviews but now I am stuck with 128 diapers. I don't even know what to do.For a small fraction of a price, you could get better quality diapers. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand. Your kid deserve better!"
1,No Luv for Luv diapers,"If I could give zero star, I would have done it. The diaper is very thin. It leaked on almost every single one that we used. Don't waste your money buying this."
1,Aren't these supposed to catch the poo?,"Conventional wisdom is that the diaper's primary function is to absorb urine and catch the poo. Although, if you were a Luvs devotee, you'd think that the poo is supposed to leak through every time, while the fastening tape is there to cut into your child's legs. Yes, these are unconventional diapers that don't do what a diaper's supposed to do. Of all brands we've tried, to include generics, these are the crappiest.For a good brand, with a lot of comfort try one of the following:1) Pampers, 'cause they got all the coolest cross-branded characters2) Huggies, 'cause they got the gigglastic that is both elasticky and makes all the kids giggle.3) Kirkland Signature, yes, the Costco brand. They look way more comfortable than your average diaper and are a good deal cheaper. I've yet to see one of these leak.Then again, if you're ok with leaking poo, go with the Luvs, they're guaranteed to satisfy."
4,Luvs Diapers,Luvs diapers has been far the most reliable product for my baby. The diaper keeps her dry.
4,Good diaper,"Comparing to Pampers Cruisers, it has similar characteristic in stopping leaks. It's thin and the absorbed water is evenly distributed. I would rate this product 4.5 stars. I would rate it 5 if the sticky part is a little bit softer. Overall, I am satisfied with this product."
2,disappointed,"They are not easy to put on; its like wraping you baby in card board. They use tape not velcro to stick, so the tape get stuck to baby's skin then baby gets upset when you pull it off. They are not strechy at all and seem to run a bit small. Just spend the extra $5 and order a box of pampers swaddlers, they are so much better."
2,Old Box,I was very disappointed when I got my new box of diapers this week. I purchased these only because of the great reviews. I received an old box without the stretchy tabs and they did not have that nice powdery smell to them either. I sent them back and bought a new box at the store! Very much of an inconvience.
2,Luvs,These diapers do not have enough flexibility and are too narrow. I also have to buy a size bigger than I would buy with Pampers Cruisers. The absorbency is good but that is the only thing I like- this was my first and last purchase of Luvs.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"We used to love Luvs. They were especially good through the night. But after using Huggies Supreme for the past several months, we took advantage of the Amazon offer and we're surprised to find them a lot flimsier than we remembered. Even worse, about 3 out of every 4 have leaked right through, forcing out washing machine to work overtime. We never used to mind paying a little extra for what we'd get in return, but it would seem along with the new, lower price has come lower quality. It's back to Huggies for us."
2,Too many leaks,"I tried this brand due to the number of diapers you get for the money. My son was only 14lbs when I bought the size 2 and they seemed like they didn't fit him already. They don't have much elastic on the sides, so it doesn't stretch like Pampers or Huggies. The first one I put on him leaked and it was on correctly. Since then, I have had at least one leaky diaper a day. I bought the Huggies brand from Amazon and I am sticking with this brand. I never had any leaks with it and it seems to fit him the best."
1,"Last 4 BOXES Reaked Of Smoke,Bleach,Plastic,&Factory(WHAT HAPPEND TO THE BABY SCENT?)","I was once an Avid believer and buyer of Luvs Diapers @ Amazon they have the best deals, plus free shipping.What more could you want?! Well I am dissappointed to say the first two boxes of Luvs I recieved were the unfinished,factory bleaced... still smelled like burnt out tree bark or some type of smoke.and Plastic...Absolutely NO Baby Scent to be found.So I called Luvs first in dibelief.Then I started searching for Amazon number which is not the easiest to find.Amazon is refundig me my money and the customer service was very helpful once I reached them.Unfortunately I will not be buying LUVS from Amazon any more but I will be switching to Pampers or buying diapers at a local store.Hope this was helpful"
2,Their Busted!,"I recently bought the Luvs brand diapers after a friend recomended them. I ended up having several of them split on me during the night and covered my infant in slimey gell from head to toe. The diaper was not even full at the time. She has wore Huggies in the pool before, it swelled 3 times the normal size then and it never burst like that.I called the company to complain and they said that they have never had a problem like this before.They said the chemicals were harmless and not to worry about it, but she did get a rash from the stuff.I did not get a refund of my money, the best they could do is send me a $10 off coupon for my trouble.My advice....Stick to Huggies!Carolyn Cropper"
2,i dont know,the price for so many diapers is great but they cant stay on my baby for to long if he gets wet some diapers can witstand some damage but not these. Right now that he is a year old and climbing all over the place they arent going to cut it anymore he wears size 5. They just hang on by a thread.
3,Quality is going downhill,"I have used Luvs, Pampers, & Huggies. More recently Luv's, but I am strongly considering changing back to either pampers or huggies b/c the Luv's continue to fall apart when you pull the tab towards the front to secure it. This has happen to 1/2 dozen diapers. Maybe I got a defective case, who knows."
2,Another Academic Study,"This is a relatively short academic work, with 135 pages of text, 16 pages of notes, a 20-page bibliography, and index. The author is Chair & Associate Professor of Communication Arts at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, IL. She draws her conclusions from five Disney contemporary animated features: The Lion King, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, and Mulan, with a chapter on each. These are bookended by two additonal chapters: Disney, Film and Morality: A Beginning and A Disney Worldview: Mixed Moral Messages.I found this a mostly ponderous read and didn't think it broke any new ground. There just wasn't much for me to get excited about."
2,Give me a Break...from this garbage!!!,"The first song, All Night Long, is o.k. The second one (Merry Christmas From the Family)- a grand theft from Robert Earl Keen, is the worst remake of a song I have ever heard. Not only do they change some of the words, and some of the beat, but they take out all of the fun and humor that made REK's song so great. Buy the REK CD containing this song instead. You will be much happier."
5,For some good catching up,"I had bought the VELVET ROPE and truly enjoyed and I wanted to explore some of the great janet tunes that i had heard on the radio. I was only familiar with some of the songs and when i got tickets for her tour.. i wanted to make sure that i knew all her hits.. I managed to get my sister to buy me the import *best of* in thailand and it turned out to be a great choice. Even though you are paying extra for ""whoops now"" (which you may have since it's the hidden track on the JANET album) and the duet dance song ""best thing in life are free""... i think they are good songs to fully complete this compilation. some of the songs are edited to fit the two extra songs...like for instance... ""Rythum natoin"" is cut to the beginning of the song instead of the pledge intro in the US DESIGN OF A DECADE CD. so anyways.. if you wanna get the good hit.. go all out and get the import *best of*"
4,Grand Opus!,"The concept behind this album is very interesting, the music, no complains on that aspect, and the vocals, well, picture this: You would certainly think female vocals are supposed to be clear and crystalline. The truth is, it isn't supposed to remain like that! Here you have both clear and harsh vocals, coming straight from a lady's mouth! Just great! a personal favorite on my list.The four stars rating is due the Bauhaus cover, I have never liked them and a cover by this brilliant band won't make me change my mind. (I know I'm going to be hated by quite a bunch of goths after this)"
4,Excellent Album,"This is the first time i've ever heard this band, and upon listening to the whole cd several times I'm very impressed. They are somewhat difficult to describe, but they do remind me a great deal of Cradle of Filths ""Principle Evil Made Flesh"" . Slow to moderate speed, grinding guitars, and overlaying keyboards (which tend to get in the way on a few tracks). The vocals are exceptional and very aggressive, if you like evil growls and screams then you will enjoy the vocals on this record. Overall I would say its a must buy for any Black or Dark Metal fan."
4,carnal delight in the vortex of evil? hell yes!,"Incredible. Opera IX is dark and heavy, and it gets better. With these wicked female vox, you won't be disappointed. I also recommend 'A Call To Irons', a tribute to Iron Maiden, for their excellent black metal version of 'Rime Of The Ancient Mariner', and of course some other great stuff (Opeth, Morgion, etc), although I think they are one of the highlights. The Bauhaus cover on this cd is decent too, although their original stuff is much better. Congressus cum demonae ad Opera IX! Nemo me impune lacessit!"
2,Is it pimple? Is it a turd? No its..,"Lars pops on his intergalactic avant-garde cape, clenches, groans and plops out a collection of the most cringe-worthy blobs this side of hollywood.First year architecture student: **swoon** ""Will we ever see him again?""Why yes, on every second-hand bookshop shelf in the galaxy..."
3,a good rocker,"""Razor Sharp"" is a good rockin' 70's album. My favorite track is ""Dead Man's Ransom"" and I still play that track a lot.The singer's name is Jimmy Mack and after he split with Slick Band he made 3 albums that are up there with my all time favorites. His first two were on Big Tree records, if I remember right and his third was on RCA as""Jimmy Mack and the Jumpers"". I would love to see these albums on cd."
3,Razor Sharp Kinda Dull But Noteworthy,"I got this one in the bargain rack of the cd store of the Navy Exchange over in Naples Italy, Only bought It because I bought 'In Your Face' and was completely blown away by 'IYF', Razor is Earl 'early' (no pun intended) in his career and I believe him to be a damn good pioneer of classic rock, this album would be best described as Lynrd Skynrd meets Old Journey.Definately an obscure collectors addition to a collection of obscure guitarists of the 70's. Once Again, 'In Your Face' is a MUST HAVE! Later, Tater"
2,I don't want to enter a title.,"I'm not sure if other people have had this problem, but the copy I received is so full of flaws as to be pretty much unlistenable. It almost sounds like someone took a needle and just scratched out a few seconds every minute or so; it's full of blips and gaps. At several points on the second track the music just cuts off for a full 15 seconds. As for the parts which are actually still there, musically it's great, like everything else from this group; there are the expected odd time signatures, creative melodies, and impressive basslines, but this disc itself seems to be one of the most damaged I own, and it's brand new. You ripped me off, Amazon."
5,Damn Good,Bela Fleck isn't really pigioned holed into one particular catagory. Kind of a Blue Grass/Country Rock band. Fine musicians and good arrangements. A great change of pace.
1,"Understanding the setting of the Incarnation - opens the heart, mind to a sense of drama which puts us in the action.","- You are in the setting, surrounded by characters and are given a chance to both spiritually and mentally see how the action unfolds around you. Good reading to refresh your own sense of being a person whose action and choices can make a spiritual difference in the lives of those around you. This drama is after all the unfolding of living faith. Challenge yourself to explore the insights."
2,handle gets hot!,"I had a 3 qt revere ware tea kettle for years--the whistling cap finally broke, so I was glad to see this one. But I should have looked more closely at how this is structured--you see that little bit of metal near where your finger must go to pour? It's really hot! But hey, this feels like it will break much sooner than the other one and I'll know to shop around more carefully and never never trust a brand again."
4,Nice little kettle,"This ""Revere"" teakettle is just right if you have difficulty lifting a bigger one. The only downside is that the whistle is loud enough to wake the dead -- but then again, that's what it's for -- to get your attention!"
3,now its made in china,The original tea pot we replaced with this was the exact model. We had it many years before it failed. The new one is made in China. Who wants to bet it will last anywhere near as long?
3,"Kettle is Okay, but the older models were better","I've had a Revere Ware whistling tea kettle for about 18 years and after the whistle piece came off, I decided to buy another one. The new kettle is OK, but compared to the older one, the new one seems to be thinner gauge steel. There was a small dent on the bottom, but it was not worth the trouble of returning and did not seem that it would affect its operation. It's a tea kettle, I use it to boil water and it whistles when it's ready - I'm satisfied."
2,6 Cup whistleing and splattering kettle,"Nice quality kettle, but the 6 cup kettle i bought splatters and shoots boiling water out once it hits boiling point. So not only do you get the whistle..but you get boiling water spitting and shooting out of it. I think this is just too small for its own good.I usually only fill it part way to keep the eruption to a minimum. Also my elctric stove I only use this at about a 6 or a 7 so the coils don't get too hot.Think twice on this cute and small kettle. I put a picture up of this eruption in action."
1,"I got the ""lemon""","The seam between the kettle and the copper bottom began to leak after our fourth or fifth use. I promptly returned it, and bought another brand. Would not recomment."
1,Not your mother's Revere teakettle,"My wife and I grew up using Revere teakettles. They are the gold standard as far as we are concerned. Each one we have owned lasted for years and years. Imagine our disappointment when after buying this teakettle for Christmas, it began to RUST after only four weeks. At first we noticed that the water coming out of it seemed a little yellow, then spots of rust began to bloom along the edge where the silver kettle meets the copper bottom. Something is very wrong in the manufacture of these kettles now. They should never rust. I strongly advise you to look for another teakettle until Revere gets their act together."
2,There has to be better quality out there.,"After having grown up with this type of kettle that lasted for years, I bought this.Well, there is a small leak at the bottom seam. I keep thinking it will eventually seal itself with water deposits, and it may.However the spout also dribbles while pouring, no matter how slow or fast you try to pour. Plus, although they advertise it as a stay-cool handle, the only time it's cool is when it isn't being used. The handle heats up VERY quickly and gets VERY hot - too hot to hold with bare hands.Other than that, it's ok."
5,Whistle me from my reverie,"I used to boil water for tea in a regular pot on the stove. I would put it on and walk away but forget to come back because I would get involved in some other activity. By the time I got back to the stove, most, if not all, of the water would have boiled away. Sometimes it would take the smell of hot metal for me to recall that I had meant to make some tea! It got very frustrating, but I was not interested in standing over the pot to wait for it to boil. So, enter the Revere Whistling Tea Kettle to save the day! I actually bought it in 2006, but it has served my family well almost every day since then and I don't see needing to replace it for many years to come."
1,A disappointment,"What a disappointment! Revere is a mere shadow of its former self. Made in China, paper thin copper bottom. And a lid design that you can't operate without your finger hitting the hot dome of the pot. Definitely not worth the price."
1,piece of junk,"My previous Revere Ware kettle lasted more than 15 years. With this one, made in China, parts of the cap assembly fell into the kettle after 4 months. When I crimped them back together, it no longer whistled."
2,They don't make things like they used to.,"I've grown up with a Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea Kettle. So naturally when I needed a new one I looked for one and purchased it. I'm disappointed as the whistle on my new one is not as loud as my old ones nor is it loud enough for me to hear when I am in another room. I hope they are not all like that, but now I will probably purchase a different model when I need a new one.Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea Kettle"
5,Revere Tea kettle,"Like all Revere products, this one works perfectly in my electric kitchen. It does not stain or leave a burnt-smell when heating water."
5,Revere 6 cup teakettle,"This one is an exact replacement for the one that I left on high heat and forgot about, when I found it the plastic handle was too hot to hold. Amazon supplied the replacement in three days."
5,"Finally, my mother's old tea kettle!","I have tried several more decorative tea kettles and finally bought this one. The wide bottom fits on any size burner and the copper heats super fast. Then there's the wake-the-dead whistle--no way to get distracted and forget the water was boiling, only to find a white-hot melting mass on the stove (yes I have done that--more than once). I read that the smaller Revere kettle dripped when pouring so I got the larger one, and it pours fine. Just skip all the others and get this one. Really."
4,Quality Teapot,I have always loved Revere teapots and this teapot has not disappointed. The only criticism is that is takes it a little time before the whistle can be heard throughout the house.
2,The little kettle that can't,"I recently bought a new kettle directly from the folks who make Revere Ware when my old one failed after 10 years. Unfortunately, they are no longer made in the U.S. and their craftsmanship has definately suffered for it. The first thing I noticed was that the bottom was thinner than my original; not a big deal only an observation. Next, I observed that the kettle's whistle didn't whistle, but rather whispered so you could only hear it if you were in close proximity. Finally, the lower part of the handle had a piece suddenly 'pop' off when the kettle was boiling. I contacted the manufacturer who was very responsive and more than happy to replace the kettle without receiving the damage one back. Makes me think that they are very use to replacing this product. Hopefully the new one works better, but not a promising start."
4,Old Standard - Does A Good Job,"There are so many teapots with all sorts of gimmicks and many for outrageous prices. We are simply boiling water here and in my case, mainly for tea. This does it fast with the copper bottom, has an undeniable whistle you can't ignore (unless you're deaf) and looks fairly nice on the stovetop. It's also inexpensive so it's a good price value tradeoff. The only reason it doesn't get 5 Stars is that it's nice looking but it's not an aethetic masterpiece. But I'm pleased with it and use it multiple times daily."
3,Sometimes Bigger is Better.,"Beautifully made, it does what a teapot should, but is simply too small for any but the occasional tea drinker."
1,Revere 3-1/2-Quart Copper Bottom Teakettle - poorly designed,"Poor design,.......handle opening is not high enough resulting in burned knuckles.Also poorly balanced, hard to handle."
2,Not your mother's tea kettle (and I don't mean that in a good way),"This is my first review of anything anywhere, so you know I feel strongly. My 10 year old Revere Ware copper bottom tea kettle had to be tossed recently--someone accidentally melted the handle. I replaced it with what I thought was the identical item, but no. The metal could not possibly be thinner--it is so very lightweight. Takes longer to boil water and you actually hear the water boiling in the kettle before the whistle starts. This boiling action makes the kettle rock a bit. It is very strange to hear water boiling through metal. This thing is a disappointing hunk of junk. Very sad. I emailed the company--my feedback will be passed on. They don't care. Another grand American brand hits the dust (but of course it isn't made here anymore). Didn't know metal could be this thin. Only giving this two stars because it will boil water..."
2,Oh-oh... Somebody Forgot Something,These kettles used to have a trigger stop to hold the spout open so you could keep water hot without listening to the whistle 'scream.' Not any more!
1,Piece Of Made in China ^%@%#$#*&#*&@,"I had my doubts when I turned it over and it was stamped ""China"". It leaked from the moment I first put water in it. On my second attempt to use it the side split. Absolute garbage!RN"
3,Not the best....,"I have had this kettle for less than 1 year (about 4-5 months less). It boils water and whistles as expected but the quality is less than perfect. The flap that opens to let you pour the water has always felt less than secure. This morning, I noticed that one of the pins holding the flap in place is coming out. I tried to push it back in with no luck. So, it boils water but does not stand up to regular use!!"
1,Not good for elderly,I bought this item for an elderly person and she complains because it is hard to get the water in through the spout and there is no way to clean the interior when a lime buildup occurs.
2,Looks nice but poorly made,"This kettle, like so many products once made with pride in the US, is riding on a reputation it no longer deserves. I've seen old Paul Revere kettles last for 30 years or more but this one is not cut from the same stuff. While the metal work looks okay the cheap plastic handle and spout opening mechanism looks like a child made with a pocket knife. I'm skeptical that this thing can handle the daily grind of the stove top and I fully expect the plastic components to disintegrate within a year or two. If wasting the Earth's limited resources to make junk that will be in a landfill in a year's time bothers you then this is not the product for you."
1,Don't trust the high-rating of this product (like I naively did),"I was looking for an affordable, whistling, tea kettle and decided to go with this product due to the high rating it received. After initial use, I could not understand how this product ever made it out of the ""prototype"" phase as it is completely devoid of needed features/functionality.First of all, if your hand is any larger than a small child's, beware of getting burned when using the handle. It's nearly impossible for your fingers not to brush up against the insanely hot metal when going to grip or release your grip from the handle.Second, and this is the deal breaker for me and why I am returning it, water dribbles down the side (not into your mug) of the kettle and drips all over the counter when you attempt to pour at anything less than full tilt.Talk about frustrating and disappointing: the product and the undeserving rating users have given this product."
2,Hot Handle!,"I ordered the 6-cup version of this tea kettle based on the number of people who said that the handle did not get hot.THEY LIED!!! If you boil a nearly-full pot, you cannot touch the handle, it's so hot!!!Also it seems to take a long time to boil 6-cups of water.I don't know if there are any better tea kettles out there, but I do NOT recommend this one."
4,Classic Whistler,"This is an easy to use, quality-built, whistling tea kettle. I bought this for my mother-in-law, who has difficulty opening other brands' kettles, and tends to leave things on the stove too long. This one is easy: just pull the trigger and it is open for filling or pouring. There is no center opening to complicate matters or provide an opportunity to burn fingers or frustrate arthritic hands. The copper bottom transfers heat quickly so water boils before she forgets it is on. The whistle is a must. On that point, however, this whistle seems to fill up with water, instead of vapor, and spit as much as whistle. Thus, the 4 instead of 5-star rating. Strange, because we own a slightly smaller version which works perfectly."
1,BAD,Smelled and tasted like burning plastic.We boiled it several times and finaly put it in garbage.Box said made in china.when are these companies going to realize not everyone wants the cheapest piece of junk they can find!Revere is not the company or name they used to be.Last time for us Revere Ware Bye Bye.
3,"It's ok, but not great","I purchased this item recently. Especially with the cold season on its way. It heats up the water ok. The concerns I have with it is the whistle isn't that great. Sometimes I have to use a pot holder to pick up the kettle and pour the hot water. The handle gets hot to handle when boiling water if you leave it on the stove too long. (This may be a design flaw or even a safety hazard. The handle shouldn't conduct heat like it does.) Don't remember this happening with others in the past, however they used much better engineering in the past. I am afraid that the whistler will break in the not too distant future. It feels cheap. But again, the tea kettle I purchased several years ago was ten dollars more expensive. Also, it isn't as easy to clean as the previous one I had purchased. The lid came off of that one."
5,RevereWare Teakettle,"Got this product for Mom for Mother's Day - the original one she had for 30 years or more had been destroyed by overheating. Hadn't been able to find one in any department store and feared they weren't making them anymore. She literally cried when she saw it, she was soooo happy to get it. Thank you so much for a wonderful product that made my Mom's day!!!"
4,Tea Kettle,The handle and pour spout are very easy to use and it has a copper bottom that heats quickly. I would have preferred this style in a larger size but couldn't find it.
4,spout cover lever broke but...,"Before a year of use, the spout cover phenolic lever broke.I contacted the vendor's Customer Service, and they promptlyreplaced the kettle.Great service if you have a defective item!"
2,I miss our old kettle!,We purchased this kettle to replace our 25 year old Revere Ware kettle because it was worn out. The quality is no where near the original. It is much flimsier and you need a pot holder to pick it up because the handle gets too hot to the touch. I am very disappointed.
5,Replacement for a thirty year old tea kettle just like it.,"In the late seventies I bought a Revere tea kettle just like it and the whistler on the spout had just come loose. So, I thought I would get another one just like it, because they are pretty much indestructible."
3,Only one hang up,"There just doesn't seem to be as great of a selection as you would think for tea kettles ESPECIALLY when you have a gas range. You've got to get top quality or you'll burn up the pot. Copper or copper bottomed pots are ideal for gas and this one is decent. The copper bottom will need cleaning with special copper polish if you want to maintain it. The hinge top seems like it isn't well made and might break after extended use. Whistle is very loud. The copper means a fast boil time and a lasting heat for your water if you are a person that enjoys several cups. Good size (not too big, not too small.) The one hang up some may have: It's hard to clean because there is no large opening at the top like other models, there is only the pour spout opening."
3,Whistle isn't loud enough! What happened?,The whistle in earlier versions was very very loud! It is now not loud enough. What is the problem with the new version?! Another product disappointment from China.
4,pretty lil whistler,It's a nice small kettle. Looks good on the stove top. The handle does get hot and I need pot holder but I've no regrets.
3,Copper Bottom Kettle,"This is the 2nd copper bottom kettle that I've owned. My first one lasted more than 10 years. Although the new one works as well as the old one, it's cap opening mechanism is not as smooth. I guess they made it more ""cost efficient""."
2,Did the job for almost 2 years!,Ant then the little plastic piece you use to draw open the spout broke. Wish this had been made of stronger stuff. Obviously I'm not buying this again.
5,Saved my house!,"I owned one of these tea kettles previously. IN my haste one morning, I turned the water on and left for work, totally forgetting that I had turned the stove on. Eight hours later my husband came home to discover my mistake. Amazingly, the teakettle was still in great shape -- off course, the copper bottom was quite burned and the inside was charred beyond use BUT my house had not caught on fire as the teakettle did not melt! Had I had a different teakettle, I am certain the outcome would have been totally different and quite traumatic. I had to replace the Revereware teakettle but would never consider using anyother type. (I am more careful with the stove now!)"
1,A good way to burn your finger,"This is a beatiful tea kettle, but has one major defect that makes it unacceptable. The handle and spout release is so close to the hot metal of the kettle that it is inevitable that you will burn your finger. As an engineer, I pride myself on being able to handle close tolerances. However, the smallest movement of your finger when you pull the trigger for the spout makes it very likely that you will burn your index finger. I have had other Revere tea kettles over the years, but never run into this problem before. Perhaps someone decided to 'improve' what was an almost perfect product and improved it in a negative direction."
3,No lid,"I wasn't paying attention that this one does not have a lid. It's helpful if it does, I like to scrub the inside once in a while. -one star for that. The spout, could be a little longer, have to be careful when pouring because it drips a bit and might get on your feet. Not sure how long the lever will last to open the whistle cap, seem cheap. Be careful if you have big hands when grabbing the handle. -one star for those. The water gets pretty hot before the whistle. No leaks so far. I would not buy this next time."
3,They don't make them like they used to.,Handle will get hot. Stainless is lighter weight. They don't make them like they used to.
4,It works well,"A little thinner on the bottom than the old classic Revere ware, but it heats quickly and whistles easily."
3,It looks like the teakettle you remember,"but it is made with less metal. Still stainless steel and copper, just less of it. (I know it's copper 'cause now, after maybe a month of use, there's a little green ring around the base.) The handle is a modern-day version of bakelite. The whistle works! The kettle is 8 1/4"" (21cm) in diameter. On my restaurant-scale stove, it is one of the rare kettles that covers the burner, which is why I bought it. On a ""medium"" burner setting, the handle stays cool enough to touch."
2,Flicks hot water.,I wanted just a simple whistling kettle so I replaced my old RevereWare kettle with the new model (lid hinge broke on old model). I was disappointed to see that that the new design puts the handle very close to the top of the kettle. The worst thing is that when you pull the trigger to pour your newly boiled water it flicks a few drops of boiling water onto your arm. I suspect this may disappear with age but my kettle is used daily and I have had it for about a month and it is still doing it. If you pull the spout trigger very slowly and controlled you can control the splatter.
2,Handle sticks - not a great design,"This teapot is a nice small size for one or two people. It looks nice and has a copper bottom. But, the handle does stick when you press it to pour water - sometimes the handle stays open and won't close without several presses, and sometimes you have to try several times to open the spout. Not as well made as I would have hoped for Revere ware."
2,you get what you pay for..,"I was prompted to buy it because of a very similar but larger version owned by my grandparents. The materials were much thicker with a higher quality handle. It lasted for decades and after they passed, went to one of my aunts or uncle. Undoubtedly, it will go to one of their kids someday. You might get a few years out of this one but it won't be passing to the next generation. My best advice is if you need a kettle, save your money and spend a few bucks on a high quality, safe and heirloom quality product. Spend more, spend once."
2,"Probably a good kettle, but hardly a whistle","Bought the item as the older we had was given away to someone else. We loved it because it had a loud whistle which could be heard in another room. This newer one was lighter, and there was hardly a whistle to be heard from it. Was really disappointed."
1,Weakly Whistling Teakettle,"Sadly, the construction of Revereware has declined to a point that you cannot hear the teakettle whistle unless you are in the kitchen. Used to be you could hear it throughout the house. I'm very disappointed!!"
2,This Kettle Doesn't Hold Water!,"This is an excellent tea kettle with a copper bottom for efficient heat transfer, BUT after three or four months it developed a leak where the spout is joined to the body. When pouring, it leaves a good sized puddle around your cup. I believe it is guaranteed, but have tried in vain to find someone to honor it. Note to manufacturer: put a notch on the cap lifter to allow it to boil without the whistle, if desired.>>>>> UPDATE: 9/19/2011 I have no explanation, but the ""dribbler"" has stopped leaking water and is still performing well as far as an economical method of heating water. Keep the copper bottom shiny for top heat transfer. The stainless steel finish is still in excellent condition after almost 6 years of use and shines up as if brand new. Now give this 4 1/2 stars. I would buy another one if this one ever gives out. R.E.W."
2,Poor quality,"I have owned the same kettle for the last 16 years and dropped it and broke the lid/whistle so I needed to replace it. I ordered the same size, brand,etc. The one I received is such poor workmanship that I am now on a quest to find something better made. The lid/whistle does not seat well so it will barely whistle. All of the steam escapes around the lid and not through the whistle. My reason for paying the price was for it ability to whistle and whistle loud so I could hear it anywhere in my house. My other rub or gripe is that I order Paul Revere which was a US product only to find out it's made in China like everything else. God only knows how much bad metal is probaly in this thing!"
2,Rusting after six weeks,I was enjoying this kettle for about six weeks. Then I noticed rust where the copper joins the stainless steel. The water was also a little off color. I tried cleaning the rust but couldn't get it all off. I was hoping the Revere brand would be fine but now I'm looking for a replacement. Try a different brand.
3,they don't make 'em like that anymore,"Bought to replace a 15 year old one like it. Lighter weight, and slightly smaller than the old one. And the whistle is unpleasantly shrill.Bought through Ace Hardware by way of Amazon, when UPS lost the package Ace was not too helpful."
4,Boils well,"This teakettle is essentially the same as the one I used for a dozen years and decided to replace for aesthetic reasons. The copper bottom makes all the difference--stainless steel bottms are unacceptably noisy as they heat up. However, the new kettle is inferior in one way to my old one. Apparently the copper bottom is not the same guage metal as my old one. This one taks longer to bring to a boil. One advantage though is tht the whistle is louder on the new one--you can hear it in another room. The trigger-like mechanism for opening the kettle top on the new one rattles in a way the old one didn't. On balance, the Revere is the best teakettle available because of its copper bottom. I know because I've tried a number of others."
3,Adequate,"The whistle is of an OK volume, but is not the loudest. (My 2 year old can sleep through it...) Mine has started leaking around the seams in the metal. MY biggest gripe is that the handle heats up to the point where you need an oven mitt to pick up the kettle and pour.It should clue you in that I'm on here buying a different kettle right now. Probably the Michael Graves, see another review soon."
1,Chinese ripoff - Not worth the gamble!!!,"I knew that this was made in China and that was a gamble but my old, original Revere pot was starting to leak so I made the gamble. Turned out just fine. I boil all my family's drinking water to assure sanitation and to get rid of bad odors and tastes so this gets used almost daily. It has been doing it's job just fine. Can't really distinguish it from a USA made pot in looks or handling and performance. But, only time will tell.Only complaint: for a Chinese made pot, it certainly is expensive.Update June 18, 2012:My original rating was for 5 stars but this thing has really let me down. The kettle has developed a serious leak where the copper bottom is joined to the steel top. Just 2 months old, too far past Amazon's return period, and now I discover that this was a complete waste of money.No more Chinese Revere Ware for this household!"
1,Not the Same,Have purchased the same item in the past. The quality now has totally changed. After the first use now spotting from who knows what the water????Very light weight and the old model was the best.
4,revere copper bottom pot,This is the best style of tea pot if you want to always keep the kettle on. However if you fill it to capacity it will eventually explode water out the spout even if kept on simmer. DON'T fill it higher than 1/2 inch from the top of the lower end of the spout.
5,Great product,"This is a great product. I've been buying them for 50 years. There's only one small problem with them that I wish the manufacture would fix, that being that the finger pull in the handle breaks off easily. Thank-you."
3,too hot to handle,"handle gets too hot. also can't clean inside. cheap plastic spout, a bit awkward to operate. not great, not horrible."
2,Plastic at spout melted,"After several months of regular use (typically once per day), the plastic that closes the spout (i.e. around the whistle) began to melt. I just have a regular kitchen stove, and never leave it on the flame once it's started boiling, so this certainly should not have happened. Time to get a new kettle (from a different manufacturer)."
3,"didn't hold up, hard to clean",Bought this kettle for its reputation. After 18 months of making tea multiple times throughout the day the handle started to get so hot it couldn't be picked up without a potholder. The plastic finger lever that is used to open the spout broke off and we had to break the entire whistler off the kettle in order to pour without getting scalded. We have well water and the inside became very corroded. the recommendation of using salt to clean it worked okay but needs to be done about once a month. That's a long time consuming process.I will look elsewhere to replace this kettle. With a lid that removes.
5,Great kettle,"After a ton of research, I settled on this one. The copper bottom distributes heat evenly, the handle does not get too hot to touch, it whistles, classic look. Great kettle."
2,more China junk,"We had an old Revere Ware kettle we received as a wedding gift years ago and it was GREAT. Lasted a long time & worked perfect. When it finally came time to replace it we looked for the same thing on Amazon. Looks can be deceiving as we found out. These are now made in China from an inferior metal. Although it boiled water fast with a loud whistle, it wasnt long before the bottom started to rust & it was unusable. I guess you do get what you pay for & this isnt worth the low price."
3,"Nothing more, nothing less","When I became hooked on tea, I knew I had to get a kettle. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but I wanted something more than heating up some water in a small saucepot on the stove. After browsing the reviews for a while, I decided upon this kettle, and have been pretty happy so far.Copper is basically the best conducting material available. The copper bottom makes heating up a few cups of water a breeze, which is nice when I'm in a bit of a rush in the morning. The downside is that because it's priced at about 20 bucks, something had to be forfeited.When you pick it up, it's easy to see what it is. The stainless steel is a very thin, fragile, metal. Although the one handed mechanism is kind of handy for pouring, the handle can get a little hot if you're not used to it.All in all, it's a safe buy, but not a best (or must) buy. There are better kettles out there, but I got what I expected and it works great for what I use it for."
1,Now crappily manufactured in China w/ no customer service.,"The Revere Teakettle was once an icon. Once!I grew up with it. I bought it as an adult several times.I just bought one again in late 2009 to replace one I droppedby accident and broke the trigger.The new one was definitely of cheaper manufacturing. The metalseemed thinner. Reading the box I notice that they now produceit in China. Nothing wrong w/ China, but the manufacturing ofthis tea kettle sucked. Within a week this new Revere Teakettlestarted leaking along the bottom rim joint.Contacting customer service a Revere's website resulted in zero response.Too bad. It's a great design, but doesn't work"
1,"Unsafe, leaky kettle","I previously had the larger Revere kettle and loved it; quick to heat the water, a good loud whistle, clean pouring, etc. When it finally wore out, I went to get a new one but this 2 quart one was the only available size. Big mistake. This kettle spits out large amounts of boiling water while whistling (there's no way you can fill it to the 2 quart level; half would go all over your stovetop or, much worse, over yourself), and dribbles hot water down the base while you pour. The whistle works, at least. But it's really not a safe kettle and, as I said, I was a big fan of the Revere kettles."
1,Not good choice,"Fine small kettle, but the handle gets very hot, too hot to handle and the top doesn't really whistle."
1,wrong tea kettle,"The Reverewear tea kettle in the picture was not what I received. The explanation was that the product number was for a different kettle and the one I wanted was not available. The price for the one sent to me was discounted and my credit card was reimbursed for the difference. The transaction was satisfactory, but I was not happy with the product and ended up ordering the one I wanted from a local merchant. The blame was placed on Amazon, deserved or not."
3,"OK, but not quality built like the old Revere kettles","The kettle is made from very thin metal...it's very light weight. Plus the ""whistle"" is not loud at all...if the dishwasher is going, I almost can't hear it in the next room. Yes, it boils water, but think I'll find another one."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I had a Revere kettle that looked like the one I just bought. I had it for over 30 years, and loved it. Recently, it began leaking out of a pin hole in its bottom. I was so glad to see I could obtain another like it (I thought). I did not think the price was too high for the quality I believed I was getting. When the new kettle arrived, I was very disappointed, for it felt as light as a feather. I thought perhaps it was my imagination, so I weighed the old kettle, and the new one. The old one weighted 25% more than the new one. Also, the ""whistler"" on the new one is different. When it whistles, steam does not just come out of the spout-cover hole, it comes out in every direction. The plastic, bake o lite (or however you spell it)handle and spout cover does not seem as sturdy as the one on my old kettle. It is the same old story of this decade..........In most cases we now get less for more. In my opinion, the old one was much better, and it was used by 4 people, not just one."
4,Good but fragile,"I've lost 2 of these when people put cold water in the kettle while it is still hot. The bottom just bulges totally out of shape. I know, you're thinking 'just don't do that.' Otherwise I really like the kettle."
2,Not what they used to be...,"I have had two of these kettles previously, which I have had to replace due to my own errors (melted and broken plastic). One lasted 15, the other 12 years. This one, unfortunately, is not of the same quality as the first two, which were made in Korea, this one in China, so it has changed. It is lighter, but the worst thing is that the wistle is barely loud enough to hear in the next room, while the old ones I used to be able to hear out in my garden! If I could find another kettle as large I would have returned it, but I'll just have to make sure I stay in my kitchen when I boil all that water!I'll find out if they last as long..."
3,3rd chance,"This is my third kettle. The design is great and the whistle is loud when the water boils. The only dissapointing problem I have with this kettle is that as a daily use kettle, I have had to buy one every 1 1/2 years because the inside coating falls apart and I find metal in my boiled water. Other than a short life span, this is a great kettle....I just wish it would last longer!!!"
2,Disappointed....Started leaking from bottom.,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and after 7 months it began leaking from the bottom along the seam. Imagine her surprise when she went to the stove and found water all over it. This tea kettle should have lasted much longer. We'll be replacing it with a different brand of better construction. I also agree with other reviewers that the handle can get too hot to grip.
2,Trigger is built to break and not replacable,"This is a great product. Its a good design that functions very well. Our family have had many Revere teakettles of this design over the past four decades.---BUT---This latest version of the product is built with a serious (deliberate?) design flaw. The pull trigger that opens the spout is made of thin plastic and is the weakest part of the kettle. When is breaks (and it will), you cannot buy a replacement part. Crazy glue doesnt work for some reason - tried it. Your only option is to chuck the entire kettle and buy a new one.Aside from the cost, I personally have a problem with the waste created by this kind of planned obsolesence - trashing a perfectly good teakettle for want of a 25 cent part. When a manufacturer does not provide a facility for ordering replacement parts, its pretty clear that they are not making products for the long haul.I wont buy another Revere ware product."
2,revere kettle,i always thought my wife's kettle was slow to boil - so i bought this one with copper base - and it's even slower --really disappointed ---
2,Revere Teakettle - not what it used to be,Have used one of these for years until I ruined it. Bought a new one and found it was not the same quality I was expecting. Joint between bottom copper and steel leaked and trigger mechanism was flimsy. I returned the product. Have not found a substitute yet.
1,Leaks at spout,This is the second one to leak. The first one took a few years but this one is worse just a few weeks out of the box.It has a mechanical attachment of the spout to the body. You drip water on the counter while you are filling a cup. I think the problem is from overfilling when it goes through some violent jerks and ejects water all over the stove. That apparently loosens the spout enough to leak.
2,"Not to impressed, typical China Junk",I was looking for something to match out appliances and with a handle that doesnt burn your hands when lifting it up. Well it looks nice as long as no grease splatters on it but the handle still gets to hot to lift without a towel or oven mitt. Also I didnt check to see if it was Made in China and sure enough it is. It will be replaced soon.
5,Just what I expected,Arrived on time and was just what I expected. I could not find this in my area and my Mom was wanting a new one for Christmas. I would recommend to others.
2,TOO small,"The handle, besides being small, is so short that it doesn't fill your hand, making it hard to get a good grip on it. Plus, it's tapered toward the back so that it wants to slip out of your hand every time you tilt the kettle to pour. It heats up so that you can't hold it in your bare hands (the ad says it won't) and the small size and tapering makes the thing almost impossible to use with a hot pad. A towel might work, but then you have the issue, if you are using a stove with exposed burners, of setting yourself on fire. Buy the next size up would be my advice."
2,Not the Old Revere,"We had a Revere tea kettle for about 25 years before it wore out and I replaced it with this. Much thinner stainless and copper, and for some inexplicable reason there is an edge or lip around the bottom which makes it very difficult to heat water unless you have a gas stove (We have electric) Not for me. As configured took forever to reach a boil"
4,"Great teapot, good design","I was looking for a whistling teapot, and found this one wasn't too expensive. I like it all right but I agree with some reviews in that it is hard to clean (you can't open the top to scrub it out); the metal seems a little thin; and the handle does get almost uncomfortably hot. But it works for what it's supposed to be!"
3,Revere tea kettle,"Just before the kettle arrived, the exact same kettle was offered in a local grocery store for $14.99. I paid almost double."
2,Made in China = cheap,"This kettle design has great form and function, but it lacks the solid heft that I associate with the Revere Ware brand. I have a feeling that I'll be replacing in a year or two when the flimsy plastic trigger becomes brittle and breaks."
3,Sticky Trigger,Not the quality I expect from Revere: the trigger is a different style than the larger version: it sticks when trying to open the spout - Very aggravating as I use my kettle frequently throughout the day. Had the larger Revere teakettle for years and was always very satisfied with it. Will be going back to that model.
1,Revere 3 1/2 Qt. Copper Bottom Teakettle,This product is made of very thin material. After one week of heating water the side of the teakettle split open and boiling water ran all over. I had already thrown away the packaging. I contacted Amazon to ask if I could return it without the original packaging. That's been 3 weeks ago and Amazon has still not responded. Both the teakettle and Amazon get failing grades F-!! Will never use Amazon again to purchase a product!!Revere 3-1/2-Quart Copper Bottom Teakettle
2,Flimsy and hot... in a bad way.,"This kettle is a piece of junk. The copper bottom is about the only good thing about it. The diameter of the base is too small, so even on low heat, the flame from the gas range licks around the edges, heating up the handle. If it is left on to boil, the handle gets so hot that it is impossible to touch without an oven mitt or a towel. Poorly-designed. Don't buy this lemon. (I'm going to hunt for another one, but I think I'll buy it in person, rather than online, so I can see and feel the pot. This kind of kettle was exactly what I thought I was NOT buying the first time around, which is why I spent $20 something, instead of $10 something.)"
1,Two Tea Kettles Later,"I purchased the Revere because of its name and because I had good service from my old Revere tea kettle. First new purchase - there was a leak in the seam between the pot and the copper base. Amazon graciously accepted the defective product and sent me a replacement. I filled the pot with water, set it on the stove and heated it up. Unbelievable! It leaked in the exact same place as the returned product. Yes, Amazon accepted this one but I did not want a replacement. I'll find a tea kettle manufacturer whos product doesn't leak. Revere is no longer a household name at my house. Maybe customers would pay Revere more $$$ if its products are made in the U.S.A. and had REAL quality.[Revere 3-1/2-Quart Copper Bottom Teakettle"
1,Leaked out the bottom,Unbelievable - it rusted out and started leaking out the bottom just after a month. Don't waste your time or money on this - Amazon promptly refunded my money and sent me a return label - which is why I buy so much from them.
1,They don't make them like they used to,"After a couple of decades of daily use, my Revere finally wore out a couple years ago. I bought a new one from Amazon, and it wore out after a couple of YEARS. The plastic trigger that you pull on to open the spout got brittle from the heat and fell off. I could not believe it. How could ""they"" build a teakettle with non-heat-resistant plastic parts?"
2,Now made in China,"My husband wanted this so I ordered it for him for Christmas. These are a far cry from the way they were previously made. While the kettle LOOKS nice, it is so thin & cheaply made. I was sadly disappointed as these used to be a high quality, heavy item. This, unfortunately, is no longer the case. Now manufactured in China."
2,Revereware not what it used to be,"I bought this TeaKettle along with a 2 quart sauce pan (review also published on that) to replace two dear pieces of our Revere ware that has served our family for over 30 years. The new Revereware is very cheaply constructed and nowhere near as high a quality as the old. The Cu cladding has been reduced to the point where it no longer serves to distribute the heat evenly on the bottom. The seam rolling on the side ""leaked"" and we already see Cu verdigris on the edge. The Teakettle itself ""pops and hops"" as it heats up, an indication of thin metallic bottoms. After all these years of telling our guests how wonderful our Revere ware was to cook with, it was a great disappointment to see how cheaply made and how poorly the new stuff works. My recommendation is to buy something else."
2,It Leaks,"I've been a big fan of Revere Ware products. I liked the teakettle and have used it to boil water on a daily basis since I purchsed it in late May. It's big and sturdy, at least at first. Unfortunatley we found it leaking 2 nights ago while being heated up (not even to the boiling point yet). The leak was bad enough to put off the flame completely. The gas leak was so bad that we had to keep all our windows open for an hour for ventilation. The same thing (flame being put off) happened again twice today and it's a good think that I was right in the kitchen to catch that both times. We've decided it's too dangerous to continue use. I just wrote to request for a replacement since it's still covered by the 1-year warranty."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased the Revere whistling teakettle since Revere has a great reputation for producing a superior product.Our family has had Revere teakettles for as long as I can remember.I have used my recent purchase only three times.I almost burned myself on the trigger connected to the whistle.It is very flimsy,sticks in the open position and becomes EXTREMELY HOT even if you boil just one cup of water.In fact I had to put on a pair of oven mittens after boiling a half kettle of water.I am extremely unhappy with my kettle and will be looking to replace it."
5,i love this kettle,"I got this kettle, the biggest Reverware version, so that I could use it to fill up my French coffee press in one go. It does that, and with style. The whistle is loud enough so I hear it no matter where I am in my apartment. The little spout lifting finger hook is a awkward at first, but once I got comfortable with it I had no trouble at all."
1,I mistakenly thought it was made in USA..,"I had a Revere whistling teapot for many years when I was younger, but not in recent years. I thought I was ordering approximately the same small size I had always used years ago. I was dissappointed when I opened the box because this pot was so tiny. It looked like a toy to me. The handle is so small that my last two fingers slide off the end of the handle and I have burnt myself a couple of times with the hot steaming pot. Also, I had been reading teapot reviews for a few weeks and I had read Revere teapots were still being made in the USA. This was the Number One reason that I chose Revere, yet this teapot was made in China! Very dissappointing. I should have returned it.."
3,Doesn't whistle loud enough,We ordered this item because it is identical to one we have had for years. The problem is that it doesn't whistle as loud as our old one did. And that is the reason we wanted a whistling teakettle. So that is the reason we aren't happy with it.
2,Revere Tea Kettle -- A Poorly Chosen Gift,"The tea kettle is cheaply made, thin, not the Revere product I recall from growing up. The handle is too hot to handle without a pot holder, the finger pull to open the spout is extremely flimsy, not stable. I do not recommend this product at all. It makes an acceptable watering kettle for plants. Waste of funds."
5,whistling tea kettle,This is an excellent quality water/tea kettle. It whistles to remind me I have some thing on the fire. I am on my third one of these tea kettles in 51 years. They do last long; keep their shiny finish and the copper bottom is easy to clean. Amazon delivered within a few days. Nothing more to ask for.
3,Too hot to handle,"I've owned the larger size Revere copper bottom tea kettles for years, and they're a classic, perfect design. But this smaller 6-cup version doesn't live up. The pour spout is very small, which makes it difficult to fill from my water cooler without spilling. And the small handle is too close to the kettle and gets too hot to grip for pouring. Can't do it without a pot holder. The larger Reveres don't have this problem."
5,More than expected,I was looking to replace a simular product and this one far exceed my expectations. It is a little different from the one I replaced but the changes make for a better product.
2,Bummer,This is a lame kettle. Less then a month oldThe plastic cover is already meltedHandle heat up very hotTrigger feels cheap weakI'm already looking for a replacement.Bad design
3,Teakettle,"It looks nice and pours nice, but it takes a long time for the water to heat up because the instructions say not to use anything more than medium heat setting on the stove. That is disappointing."
3,tea kettle,"This tea kettle serves its purpose, but I did notice some discoloring along the bottom edge line. I've only had it cpl. wks."
3,"Good Size, But Sprays Water All Over The Place","Postive: Good size, affordable, copper bottom means water boils quickly.Negative: Kettle stopper sprays water all over the place. Kind of cheap looking, not the Revereware I remember."
1,Revere 3-1/2 Qt Copper Tea kettle,"I replaced an old Revere tea kettle of the same size. The new one has a bad taste and smell that I can not get out with repeated vinegar boilings, as recommended with the literature that came with the kettle for cleaning. I suspect bad copper or too much flux used to solder the bottom to the sides, The product was made in China. We are NOT using the kettle at this time due to the offensive smell and taste."
5,This is the one to get.,Great teapot! My family has used these for 30+ years. Everything else either burns your hands or plain sucks.
5,Tea Kettle,Bought it for the husband who wouldn't replace the broken down/electrical taped up lid of the last one! Since he liked it soooooooo much I went on line to find another JUST LIKE HIS!
1,smelly pot,"I have purchased the same brand over the years but this one just smelled funny. I washed it and it still smelled. Hopefully it was just a faulty teapot, I sent it back for a refund."
1,Bad Product,"I have never written a review for a product on Amazon. Some times you get bad stuff, but I figure that is just the way it is. This product however warrants my first review. Is is by far the worst item I have ever bought on Amazon. I have probably 500 purchases this year. It takes forever to heat up and when it does you can not touch the handle without getting seriously burned. This product is actually dangerous. It is headed for the trash can."
3,"Basic, good looking, cheap kettle.","I bought this teapot for my lady, because it goes with her retro kitsch aesthetic. Plus, it kind of looks like a curling stone, which is cool. It's inexpensive and pretty good looking.The metal is VERY thin, and the kettle is light. This means...it's just not a very high quality kettle. I guess that's fine, considering the price.Also, the plastic somehow melted on the stovetop. I'm willing to forgive this, and chalk it up to user error, as the stove is one of those beastly Wolf commercial ranges and was probably set too high. Revere is off the hook for that one.So, it's a cheap teakettle, both in price and build quality. Meh."
2,Tea Kettle,The kettle is great not happy with the lid of the spout. It doesn't fit securely on the spout.It doesn't open smoothly either. I like the size of the kettle.
5,Revere 6-Cup Whistling Tea Kettle,"I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and this little tea kettle is perfect for me! The size, weight, and ease of pouring make this tea kettle my favorite friend when it is time for tea. :)"
1,Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea Kettle,"I do not recommend this model of tea kettle. The one we received was made extremely cheaply and it was in fact defective in the spout/lid part, because it doesn't close all the way and because of that, it doesn't whistle at all.I loved my old revere ware kettle (probably from the 60's).... but this newer version just doesn't have the quality like they used to."
4,Basic kettle,I've had this kettle for about a month now and overall it's a good basic kettle. It does not have a lid so it can be a little awkward to fill but then there is no lid to lose. I am concerned that the hook attached to the lid won't hold up over time since it's cheep plastic. The hook can also be a little tricky to latch when trying to open the spout.
1,2-1/3 quart is too small,it is made of thin metal - it is very light and feels and looks very cheaphandle is very close to the kettle and becomes very hoteither I'll get a big and proper one or electricalso far - return
3,Handle gets too hot,"You will need to keep a thin mitt or something handy, otherwise this kettle gets way too hot to pick up when it boils. seriously, it will burn you if you try too use your bare hand."
5,Good Cd,"If you liked the janet. songs, and you like remixes, then this CD is for you. There are a lot of good remixes here, but it can get repetitive if you don't know the original songs. But if you do know the originals, then this CD is just a nice twist to what you're used to."
2,Pales in comparison,"If you're able to get your hands on the Control Remixes and think to yourself that this album is prolly as good as that one don't bite. Her best mixes from Janet are on her CD maxi's. I am not sure why she picked some of the mixes she went with here. She could've turned Throb into an even more sexual tone, and had more instrumental on That's the way Love goes. And don't even get me started on Because of Love. This is a vanity piece, far from a must-have and about the only stumble in my collection of hers (which is about ten CD's)."
1,awful album,This is not an good remix album. None of the remixes are good nor have they anything to do with her songs. Stay away from this crappy album.
4,Almost Perfect...They Forgot To Add 'One More Chance'!,"'janet.remixed' is a nice supplemental CD for fans who own Jackson's best selling 'janet' disc. Available only as an import, 'janet.remixed' features a stunning array of remixes, but the two B-sides ('And On & On' and '70's Love Groove') are worth the price of the CD. 'janet.remixed' could've been a 5 star CD if they included 'One More Chance', which was the B-Side to the 'If' single. I remastered my 'janet.remixed' CD to include 'One More Chance' as track #12, and there's more than enough space on the CD! Enjoy!"
2,"Love the Book, but type is too small",I have this in Hard Cover and it is my own fault for ordering this smaller version.Type is too small.
2,Book is so small,The book is so small and hard to read. I'm disappointed in the size of the book. It's not big enough.
4,Very good...,I wanted to give this book 5 stars but about a 5th of it was dry. The rest is just GOLD. I'll definatly consider this book for my personal ministry.
2,The Message,"The book, The Message, was a very small book. I was expecting to receive a regular size book. The Bible itself is very good. I don't like that the book is so small and the print is hard to read. When I placed the order there was no indication what the size of the book would be. I had planned to give the book to friends and family but I don't think they will be able to read it very well."
5,Excellent Bible,"What can i say, this is a translation that has been out for quite some time now. It's a very good bible, the quality of the book is great. nothing negative to say. If you know this translation and like it, you will love this book. Just be aware this is New Testament Only, not the whole bible."
1,Oh God no,"Please oh please read another Bible. I don't hate this ""translation,"" I really don't. And if it brings somebody to Christ, then who cares what I rate it. But seriously, I have never cringed so much reading anything before. The great thing about the Bible is that it can be understood through its already fantastic simplicity--parables involving such easily comprehendable things as bread and water, for example--that they really don't have to be re-written so drastically as they are in The Message. And isn't the setting and diction of Christ and his work what makes the Bible such a fantastic literary work? I'm probably just old-fashioned; for every person I know who dislikes The Message I know five that find it wonderful. Personally, I recommend you look it over before you buy, and make sure that if you do purchase it, it's not the only Bible in your library."
2,Nice poetic prose...for those that already know the Bible,"The book arrived on time and in new condition. I ordered this size because I wanted something compact and did not realize the print would be so small. As far as the book...er...Bible...itself...I agree that there are some interesting passages, but this is for people who already know scripture already and can hold this ""translation"" up to others. I am not a King James purist (not yet, anyway :) ...and there are times when the language of The Message is like reading easy poetry...its fluid and it flows, but any new age language or references are completely unacceptable...this cannot be considered an actual Bible."
5,The Message in affordable form...,"Love having this format to give to the women in jail. They appreciate a Bible written in the language we currently speak, or at least most of us speak!! Thanks to Eugene Peterson for such an easy to understand rendition."
3,My mistake,"Print too small. Didn't realize it was New Testament only. My son got the full, hard back version for my husband, a better choice."
3,I've read The Message,This item came in a timely fashion. The copy is very small so that is disappointing but the book isin good shape.Thanks
4,Excellent Reference,"Behavior and Handling of Ships is an excellent tool for the professional mariner and is a great addition to any collection of maritime reference materials. The book itself revolves almost entirely around handling large, single-screw merchant vessels so it is very focused in its application; however, it does an excellent job in doing so. What is most impressive about this work is the way the author describes to the reader the forces from the wind and current that act upon a ship - and how the operator can overcome them....or NOT overcome them!! He also goes into depth on the effective use of tugs, thrusters and the anchor. Toward the end of the book, the author lists a number of practical applications that are excellent reading. In all, the book delivers as promised in a very concise, straight-forward manner."
2,"Not bad, but I've read better.","This book isn't a bad book for learning shiphandling. However, I found Crenshaw's Modern Shiphandling, Merchant Officer's Handbook, and Naval Shiphandling much better. Still it isn't bad for the vetor theory and the pictures are helpful once you figure out what you are looking at."
4,Don't call it a comeback....,"Supposedly it was their comeback, and featured their biggest hit since ""Mary Mary"". This was still RUN DMC trying to be someone else (this time more like ONYX or Naughty By Nature) and fails on some levels, but far better than ""Back From Hell""."
2,Didn't see tha Champ,A weak documentary on the history of a great Champion.Never in his own words. But the time shipped was on time.
4,Good Movie,Good movie to watch for all the boxing fans. I enjoyed seeing all the other boxers giving their story along with ALI's. The delivery was on time as stated.
5,Best Sports Film Documentary,"This is a beautiful film. It does homage to Ali, the sport of boxing and all the men who fought him. It captures the athletic heroism and the humanity of these hard men. It really gives you a feel for how tough this sport his and how tough these guys are, both morally and physically. Watch this film even if you don't care about boxing. If you don't like the sport you will love listening to the men in this film."
3,Slow movie,This story seemed to go on and on and my son really wanted this movie but after watching this movie he lost respect and interest in Ali.
4,Touching,I've always loved the brash outspoken Ali. And I am saddened by his current condition. In his prime without question one of the greatest if not the GREATEST. To hear the reverence in which his opponents describe their experience with him was very touching. Even his old nemesis (Joe Frazier) was almost brought to tears when speaking about him. Earnie Shavers and Ron Lyle looked great the others not so much. It was also great to get insight into their personal lives as well. I didn't know George Foreman sparred with Sony Liston. Ali claimed Shavers & Frazier hit him the hardest but you will see Pierre Coopman land what I believe the best shot on Ali (almost put him through the ropes). A well done piece of work I would highly recommend to the die hard and casual Ali fan.
5,Funniest book I've ever read,"This is, without any doubt, the Funniest, most hilarious book I have ever read. There were many times when I had to put it down... I was laughing so hard I was crying. Yes, it IS that funny. I've reread the book several times over the years, and it still cracks me up. The practical jokes written up here are real, did happen, and described by a celebrated author who was a master humorist, H. Allan Smith. They go from the small & subtle to the exceedingly elaborate (believe me, you WON'T believe how elaborate). Some of these are astonishingly inventive and will have you shaking your head in wonder; others are wildly outrageous and raise the level of the practical joke to an artform. There are very few humorists that can write with such verve and wit as H. Allan Smith. Don't miss this one!"
4,Braun 360 Complete,"I reluctantly bought this, after several years with a Norelco. But I quickly changed my mind, as I found it to provide a comfortable and close shave, with many fewer strokes than my Norelco. The self-cleaning docking station is nifty, too."
1,If you skip shaving one day; forget using this shaver,"I have owned this shaver over a year now. Bottom line, if you shave EVERY day, it does a pretty good job. If you are prone to skip a day or two, like I am, forget using this shaver (after a day or so) because it will take your forever to get a close shave. When I do miss a day or two, I go back to my old Braun 3612 or my old Panasonic (both at least 10 years old). Not impressed with this shaver at all!! Do not recommend!"
1,piece of junk,I had problems with this razor from day one. Did not shave well. Would not hold a charge. Cleaning function worked intermittantly.Can't return. No Braun service centers within 100 miles.Threw it awayBuyer beware
4,Great for the price,Delivers a Great finished edge with minimal wood burn. Definately worth the money.
1,A Disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this book. First of all, someone giving advice on writing thank you notes should know that it is improper to begin them with ""thank you"" as the first sentence. Secondly, the sample notes are so contrived that you probably would not want to pull ideas or words from them to write your own. I suggest you sample a different book if you are seeking help in the area of thank you notes."
4,Great dance games come with bad dance controler.,This game is great for fun and exercise. The only flaw is the dance pad which you can buy for it. It slides around unless you duct tape it to the floor. This is very irritating and makes it worth it to plunker down extra cash on a hard mat.
5,DDR-USA: a must buy for music game fans!,"DDR-USA is one of the most anticipated bemani games coming out for the US-Playstation. If u are a music game fan, then u must get this game. And don't forget the dance pad w/it."
1,A joke,"This has got to be a joke. First of all, if you don't have the hard-to-find Konami dance pad controller (I found one in New York's Chinatown), don't bother. I don't see the point of finger-dancing on the PS gamepad. Even if you have the dance pad, the game gets boring quickly. It's not like you can pick any soundtrack, and the included music is rather lame. This is a total waste of money."
3,Overrated,"It's probably just me, but this video game doesn't fit my taste like the old-school games do. The 'excitement' found here is nothing compared to a wedding reception or a high-school prom (depending on what moves you make). Plus, only segments of the songs are included. This could be better if the whole song was played. At least that's my opinion.I found it watching others participate, but I've been forced to give it a try to one of the 'slower' songs. Not many moves. Not too much fun.This game seems okay if you want a good workout. I'm not bashing this game. In contrast, it might grow on me over time. Right now, I ... I may be too old-fashioned. :)"
4,Good got better,"I like this game, because there were a lot of songs on this one that were difficult, but fun. If you work or volunteer at a children's facility(boys & girls club in my case), then this is a great game for kids as long as you get 2 pads. Don't be stupid like I was & buy the pads at different times, because the kids will think one is better than the other. That's all I have to say"
3,Decent but disappointing,"This game is alright, but after playing the japanese ones it is more than a bit disappointing. There are too few songs, and the selection is okay but not great. They are all Bemani songs, but they left out some of the best ones that had appeared in the japanese versions. (Smile.dk songs, Kung Fu Fighting, Shook, Captain Jack songs...) Konami majorly messed up the marketing on this one also. Not enough people found out about it in the US for it to spread like it did in Japan. I got bored with this game very fast. However if you have never played DDR, you will be able to appreciate it more."
5,The Best Game Ever,"If you never played this game you are missing out all thefun. The gameplay [is not as good] if you don't use the dance pad. The graphics are not the best, but who cares all you see is your character dancing and the arrows moving. The songs are not great. Probably cause you never heard of them, but be open minded you can really dance to them. Ask anybody who played DDR and they'll say ""It's a great game""."
1,BLEH!!!,"What happened to all the best songs....Come on what are these people thinking?! if you want a good version get the imports, definitely. Most of the songs on this game are so slow and boring, I could just fall asleep. This game is a total waste of money and an insult to dance dance revolution. I was so disappointed when I saw the songlist. There are also not enough songs to make this worthwhile."
4,The Stepping Stone of Konami,"This is the first ever official Dance Dance Revolution game to hit the US in the last few years. First of all I want to say that this is not the best version Konami can make. They already have DDR Disney Mix coming in November 2001. Now the reason Konami released this version in the US is to find out if American gamers would like Dance/Rhythym/Music games in the USA. If enough gamers like Dance Dance Revolution then Konami will make us more versions with better songs. I have to admit that this particular verison of DDR stinks compared to it's imports but at least you don't have to buy an import converter for your PS to play this game. You have to realized this is the FIRST Bemani (Music Games) game to hit the USA. So Konami can either make more versions for the USA if enough gamers buy this game or stop making these underrated games for the US. But Please I hope you buy the game to show that Americans and US gamers, like me, like weird Japanese music games..."
3,A good start!,I think give this game a 3 star because the other versions are WAY better! The song in this version are the originals but kinda slow so this game is good for beiginners or people don't like having to many arrows that go up really fast. I suggest you start with this DanceDance revolution game because if you buy a more advence version you will have a really hard time on it and this one as a price very low on amazone.com
5,Dance Dance Revolution - Best game ever made,"The people at Konami have really outdone themselves! I used to spend dollar after precious dollar playing it in the arcade, but now i have it at home, where i went from failing 5-difficulty songs to passing 9's. This game is nothing less than perfection. If it were up to me, i would give this game 1,000 stars, but i cant. Buy this game!"
4,Don't knock it 'til you've tried it.,"If you've played this before, then this review won't help you.However, if you're seeing this title for the first time, then give it a long look. It's hard to explain how much fun this title is to play, until you have it and a bunch of friends to play it with. I haven't shown it a friend who hasn't liked it. Even my wife, not a physical person, plays the game a half an hour a night.I really think that it is a waste of time to buy this and not buy some third party dance pads. Two pads, the game, kickin' sound system, and all your friends equals a party.Another cool thing about this game is the other players. Ever try to ask a ""Tekken(or other fighting game) master"" how to do a special move? Most likely, you got sneered at; if not worse. However DDR players actually volunteer information to beginners. So, if you just want some fun for your PS, then buy this game."
2,"Fun, but only until you realize...","...just how few good songs there on in this release.Do yourself a favor and pick up an imported copy of 3rd, 4th, extra, or 5th mix, as the song selection, layout, and steps are far better. 4th mix and onward also have some other fun things, such as 6-arrow solo mode and the Challenges, along with the wonderful ability to edit steps.In conclusion, an imported copy is much more worth your money than this release. Konami's dance pad isn't bad, though."
5,As descriped. Thank you,It is a lot of fun. My son spends hours on it. I purchased this item for my 8 years son and he loves it.
5,Gorgeous,"This soundtrack is simply gorgeous. I acquired elsewhere, but it doesn't change the fact that this is beautiful music. The japanese versions of Stars of Tears and Small Two of Pieces (Two Wings is Stars of Tears and Mebius is Small Two of Pieces) are wonderful, even if I can't understand a word. The other songs are just as good. Dajil deserves special mention. A wonderful arrangement of the original. Buy this. The price is well worth it."
5,Good stuff!,"My service was very prompt and the product arrived unflawed and with all the original bits to it. I am very happy with it, having had a burned copy for three years and trying to find am original copy all that time. Good job!"
2,product OK but bvendor charges S & H fees that are too high,"soccer shirt was OK - authentic and good qualitybut the shirt did not fit well and upon returning the product, I was charge another shipping fee-so I am out 18.00 after trying on a shirt that was returned...AVOID THIS VENDOR_ TOO HIGH SHIPPING COST THAT ARE NOT REFUNDABLE"
4,Scientific Men-in-Black.,"Fans of Frank Drake's ""Is Anyone Out There"" rejoice, Greer should receive honorary status as a member of ""The Order of the Dolphin."" This book offers fascinating speculation on the matter of life existing elsewhere in the universe. Read the book to learn more about the history of mankind's search for extraterrestrials, why it is likely that life exists elsewhere, and the impact of what such a discovery means to our own planet and our existence. Further, Greer believes that alien life has lived (or is currently) living among us and he sets out to assert this with substantiated cases. If you ever watched earth: final conflict and believed things could sort of play out like this... the book is for you."
3,Science or fantasy?,"I asked myself is this book fantasy or reality?Some ideas appear to me as a result of a serious investigation.The author has strong opinions and seems that he is trying hard to convince us.His style of writing is dry but because the information is important and argumentative, I had an interest in reading the whole book."
2,A little dated. . .,"The book ""Other Women"" was probably much more interesting if read in the early 80s when it was written. I found it rather dull - all character development and no story."
5,WHERE ARE THE LOVETT SISTERS NOW ?,"I GREW UP IN DALLAS LISTENING TO THE BIG D JAMBAREE AND I LOVED ALL OF THE SINGERS, ESPECIALLY TWO VERY YOUNG GIRLS CALLED THE LOVETT SISTERS. I LOVED HEARING "" BACON AND EGGS"", AS I USED TO LISTEN TO THEM SINGING IT LIVE ON THE RADIO AND WATCHING THEM SING IT ON TELEVISION. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM? ARE THEY STILL PERFORMING ?"
3,Best for Lutherans,"I wish I had known that this book was written from a Lutheran perspective. While the information is solid and useful, the author constantly speaks of the genius of Luther as though he were Christ, and most of the vast resource list is also Lutheran-heavy."
4,A Contemporary View of the French Revolution,"While not the most riveting of pieces ever created, The Gods Will Have Blood does examine the events of the French Revolution from a contemporary standpoint with a certain intimacy of the subject that is difficult to find in secondary accounts. A good read for students of European history but not a NY Times Bestseller caliber choice."
1,"Love story,not flying","I purchased this looking for a good aviation thriller. What it is is a boring love story with a bit of flying in it. It literally takes half the book to get into combat and we get two or three lame sorties.If your looking for aviation combat, skip this one"
5,A Good Story of an American Warrior in the Making,"Jerry Houston's novel, ""Fight to Fly"", follows the blossoming career of a naval aviator in the making. It has all the ingredients -- romance, intrigue, excitement. The author obviously has all the necessary background to make his story believable as well as literary talent to maker it appealing. I heartily recommend this book and look forward to a sequel!"
2,Pathetically unbelievable character,I like Elizabeth Peter's works and I thought I would enjoy this earlier work. The story surrounds Tommy the protagonist and her interactions John the man who is responsible for her fathers death all in the back drop of modern Egypt. What I really disliked about this story is how the heroin lacks any emotion or impulse to avenge her father's death. The guy is clearly a creep and not even remorseful. She knew this man was the cause yet she seems almost friendly towards him at times. I read the first few chapters then skipped to the last few of the story just to finish the book. It was that bad.
4,Rather silly,Many of Peter's one off mysteries involve a heroine who has some dark family mystery that she feels personally responsible for solving by her self. The Jackal's Head follows this mold and comes up with a hokey set of circumstances. It's still a fun read for fans of mysteries that take place in Egypt and fans of Elizabeth Peters / Barbara Michaels.
2,Before Peters hit her stride,"I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was first published back in 1968. I'm not a Peters expert, but this must be one of her very early works, before she honed her craft. It is short and would be even shorter if it didn't fall back on annoying misunderstandings among the characters to maintain the tension. I didn't find the characters to be appealing, and the book lacks the wit and verve of her later works. Personally, I don't think this measures up to the Peabody books, although I notice several other reviewers differ. What can I say? I'm right and they're wrong, naturally."
1,Bag does not fit and poor delivery of all powermatic model 73 bags,This is the second cloth bag I've ordered for my Powermatic Model 73 and neither bag has fit. The reason for ordering a cloth is because of the constant problem I've had getting the deposable bags for this system. I've had to reuse the throw away bags until failure just to keep my shop running. Powermatic is a very highly regarded company and I don't understand all the problems I'm having with service parts.
1,i hated it,it didnt notice any difference. Ive tried everything i can to control my appetite and so far i still havent found that product. I wouldnt recommond this
5,Must Have For Music Lovers!,"This DVD is a near perfect production. The band performs an outstanding set. The sound is phenomenal and the video great. Anyone who loves live, heavy music should see this show. They feature one of the best rhythm sections you will see/hear. Buy the CDs and support the band!After having watched this DVD several dozen times... Get It!"
5,Great show,"First DVD from this great band, excelent show and the best performance live. It worths every cent."
5,Fantastic Textbook or Reference Book,"As an MBA student, I've read my share of books on corporate strategy. Without a doubt, ""Modern Competitive Strategy"" is one of the best. I have used it extensively both in my classes and at work. It is concise, well-written and contains all of the common strategic models (i.e. Porter's Five Forces, BCG Growth-Share Matrix, Makadok's Model, Dynamic Growth Cycle, etc), each of which is clearly illustrated through real-world examples. This is a must-have for any MBA student or business professional."
3,Cans too dented to open,"Many of the cans were too DENTED to open in our electric can opener. These cans appear to be returns to the distributor from retail stores because they are too heavily damaged to be marketed.My best guess is this distributor is taking ten cans of product he would normally have to throw away, packing a couple normal cans with it and selling it on Amazon.EVEN the CENTER CANS in the carton were badly dented. But the cans were excellently pack with air cushion bags all around. Accordingly, they were NOT damaged during shipment to me.The rounds, which are actually more meat bally spherical than round, taste acceptable. I didn't check the expiration date.Three stars because I like acceptable tasting meat substitues.It would be nice if Amazon inspected the distributor since this product is not being sold ""damaged"" but I see I'm not the only one reporting this problem."
5,Why I love Loma Linda's Tender Rounds,"There are many different companies offering veggie versions of meatballs, but this product is by far the best. It tastes more like meat than any other brand and it also comes in a delicious sauce. Whenever I serve it to my skeptical carnivore friends, they quickly stop their teasing and ask for seconds. The only problem with it, is that I didn't make it myself. In an otherwise home cooked meal, it's usually the one non made-from-scratch dish that I serve."
3,Tender rounds,"When I opened the can I didn't like the way the product looked and smelled. Kinda reminded me of Alpo. However, I poured off the gravy and put the meat balls in marinara sauce. Then it was pretty good. Reminded me of the meatballs in Franco American speghetti and meatballs. But not a mystery meat.. so it was good."
2,"delicious but most cans dented.rusted, etc","I was only able to use one of a dozen cans - they had to be disposed of as they were rusted, dented and dirty. After disinfencting the only undamaged can, i found this product to be delicious , it is a shame i won't attempt to reorder. This is the 3rd Loma Linda product that has arrived in such horrible , unsanitary and unusable condition .."
4,"Great for history, and choices, just a little bit dated on the records","I bought this book back in the early 1990s when I was just starting to learn about jazz.As an overview of jazz history, this review covers all of the basics (i.e. Kind of Blue, Giant Steps, etc), and has some eclectic choices for the 70s and 80s (this is the book that introduced me to Oregon and that was worth the price alone). The only critique is that some of the records recommended never made it to disk and are long out of print (even at the time of the publication I couldn't find about half of them); however, with the help of allmusic.com and a thorough music program with a deep jazz collection such as Rhapsody one can piece together the albums.Overall highly recommended."
2,"Got the job done, but...","(This isn't a toy Amazon!) Didn't quite engage my iPhone's screws well at first. And it started stripping the driver (not the screw). Had to push down hard to get the driver to engage the screw correctly and make sure not to over tighten (else strip the driver). It got the job done, but it might've been a one time use driver."
4,Good job girls!,"TARA FUKI are two girls (Andrea Konstankiewicz and Dorota Blahutova) from Czech republic. They playig on cellos and singing about life, love and human feelings. Their songs are experiment between classical and folk music. I can't say more than: ""Good job girls!"""
5,Prescient!,"How could Rodinson have predicted with uncanny accuracy what Israeli revisionist historians have ""discovered"" only recently? He was blind to prejudice and cant. He examined the facts, pored over historical details, and came out with 90 pages of clear-headed prose. Before the West Bank and Gaza had been occupied in June 1967, Rodinson could see the difficult position Israelis were in, as colonialists. Fascinating and worth every penny."
5,Zionism as racism,"The author is from a Jewish family and taught in the Middle East for seven years. He responds to critics who called him ""schizophrenic"" by pointing out that ""belief in the infallibility of one's own 'ethnic' group is a frequent phenomenon in the history of human groups. It is called racism."" Further, he explains how ""European supremacy had planted in the minds of even the most deprived of those who shared in it the idea that any territory outside Europe was open to European occupation.""Growing up in the middle of the US, not knowing anyone Jewish, my introduction to Zionism was the heroic portrayal in ""Exodus."" I found Rodinson's account of the arguments offered for the creation of the state of Israel eye-opening. It can help others who got pro-imperialist education like mine to understand the demand of the Palestinian people for a democratic, secular state of Palestine that would offer equal rights to all who live and work there."
1,Rodinson--another self-hating Jew (sigh),"For my paper on the historiography of Zionism in grad-school I read this piece. Having lived in France I was not surprised. Rodinson, so desperately trying to be a ""good Frenchman"" is quick to dismiss the State of Israel as the culmination of Jewish nationalism. Instead, he writes that ""the creation of the State of Israel is an outrage committed against the Arabs as a people"". He then goes on to show how Diaspora Jewry is generally unconcerned with Israel as evident that the majority of Jews live elsewhere. One might wonder how Rodinson would deal with today's statistics, as the majority of Jews now reside in Israel.All in all this is another expression of ""Galut"" mentality. While the world certainly should debate Israeli national policy just as we should all debate all national policies Rodinson's attempt to de-legitimize Zionism is a disaster. I doubt if anyone outside of the radical Left will go to this for a balanced treatment of Zionism and Israel."
3,Hilarious at the beginning and nicely protrayed characters.,"The language used by gopal is amazingly funny and the letters at the beginning are awesome, but the humor dies and it gets boring in between. Gopal's friend randy is shown as a typical american boy. Nicely portrayed some of the sequences. Ending touches my heart. Overall, an above average book."
3,a spoof about a small town indian student in america,"hilarious (mostly) and boring (in some parts ) this is a humorous account of a small town indian making his first journey to america.... the author has pulled a very fine farce on ""gopal's"" english ...which any indian student would find extermely hilarious ...in some parts the novel does drag..but on the whole a nice read..!!!"
4,Hilarious!,"The Inscrutable Americans is the first novel I read by the author Anurag Mathur. I got this novel as a birthday gift and reading it made me laugh uncontrollably!The way the main character of this story, Gopal, behaves in a new country is simply hilarious! The way Gopal interacts with everyone in English, shows he literally translates everything from his mother toungue, Hindi. The way he writes to his brother, ""My head is eating circles with all new new things"" is funny.Good read! Sets you laughing from the first page itself!!Recommended reading.."
5,A must for Indians in the West,"The author has managed to get all of his creative juices flowing in turning out this absolutely irresistable book. Over the years, thousands of Indians have travelled to the USA for studies or jobs and have encountered severe culture shocks. Mr. Mathur has managed to capture all the moods of a young and naive Indian boy from a rural setting in India who has so far only known the USA in books or movies. He comes to study in the USA and has real learning encounters. The book is hilarious without being offensive to either culture. At the same time, it is educational and incisive. One imagines that this may be a tough act to repeat for the author, but I hope he will be able to follow this up with something equally readable."
4,An American's view,"I was handed a dog-eared copy by a friend of mine from Kerala. The prose was at times lyrical, beautiful, naive, and sophomoric. As an Engineer I found myself instantly relating to the main character, however, I think the author missed an excellent chance to parody the different approaches to Western society which emmigrants have taken.post scriptum: did anyone else find it interesting that the main character consumated his carnal yearnings not with an American but one of his own countrymen, err,... women?"
2,Amatuerish effort,"There aren't many books on the Indian experience in the United States. Just having the patience, insight, and (dare I say)courage to write this book should be applauded. Some of the reviews on Amazon have been written by Indians born in the U.S. who no doubt had a rollicking laugh at the expense of their parents and relatives, as well as a reaffirmation of the 'uncoolness' of 'native' Indians. It's extremely easy to parody our third world mentality, miser mentality, and sexual deprivation, and Mathur (of course) does all that. Where I think he fails is in providing no genuine insight into the culture clash in the U.S. Any one who disagrees with me, answer this question: How different is this book than the ""How to tell if you're Indian"" emails floating in cyberspace? Basically it's an eleven dollar expansion of the same theme - and not too well written at that."
1,Rajiv Sinha,"I bought this book after reading so many good reviews by the other readers. I was rather disappointed! This book perpetuates the myth about immigrant Indians running after white women (if there is a theme of this book, this is it). Some episodes are funny (washing clothes in bath tub, bargaining at the store etc) but the rest felt too tedious to read after a while. I tried to think if my assessment may have been biased because I personally attended top ten institutions and found only top notch Indian students whose primary (and only!) focus was good quality research followed by an excellent career. Portrayal of caucasian women is also very biased. Anyway, this is my opinion. Read the book and judge it for yourself."
2,Unconvincing,"Mathur tries very hard to satirize American culture, but fails miserably. The key weakness is that in trying to portray ""typical"" Americans, he gets too many details wrong, such as the manner of American speech. Every line of dialogue in a purportedly American character's mouth made me think, ""That's not how he would say that!""The book also fails as a novel because it doesn't really have much character development or a story arc. The main character goes to the United States, is faced with a number of amusing puzzles and then, well, that's it."
4,Very informative,"If you're into herbs, this is a great resource for Chinese herbs. There are recipes for tonic teas are included."
3,"Very thin and runny, poor smell, good on skin.","It has the consistency of water and no way to gently pour a small amount out. It could use a real top to limit the flow out. It smells medicinal, I have to throw on cologne to hide the smell. It does make my skin feel tight and healthy. Isn't there a better witch hazel after-shave out there?"
2,not his best,".....loved his solo piano album and live side of the Jazz and Heritage '76, but found this to be very MOR and muted. And no ""Freedom For The Stallion"" which is his best song."
5,These stain removers are the best!,"These work! Saves your clothes. Saves you from buying a multitude of products. The only problem is that they put the instruction on top of the itemized list on the back, and it tends to peel off over time. I am trying to find the instructions for each on line so I can just print them and keep it in my laundry room. But anyway, these stain removers are the best!"
3,Works! Works! Works! But cheaper elsewhere!,"So regarding the product itself: Carbona Stain Devils works, The product itself is five star. I give three stars because of the price. I just wished I had bought it in Walmart for $1.67 (on special, still around $2.5 normal price)a bottle. Sigh..."
4,Good Stuff,"I got this lotion in a gift set for my birthday and I absolutly love it.The package is pretty enough for gift giving or to leave out on your night stand/bathroom counter.It really moisturizes my hands making them soft and supple again even after I have washed them several times.The scent is magnificent too-soft but definitly there.It comes in a rather large tube and since it is concentrated you only need to use a little bit so it last for ever practically.Definitly worth the relative ""pricey"" price.Get more than one especially if they are on sale!!"
4,Great hand and body cream,"The pump doesn't work, but the cream feels and smells good. I'd buy this product again but only if the pump worked."
5,Nicest feeling and smelling hand cream,"This no doubt, makes you feel like you've visited an expensive spa. This hand cream leaves the smell of soft lavender on your skin. I highly recommend it."
5,Two days in the life of Hemingway explaining a lifetime.,"""Portrait of Hemingway"" is an excellant descriptive story (""New Yorker"" 1950) of Hemingway NOT influenced by the recent family publication ""bandwagon."" Recommend reading ""Protrait of Hemingway"" before reading other ""new"" publications. Also, look for Lorian Hemingway's article in GQ magazine( July 1999)."
2,Highly Over-rated Portrait,"I have not been able to decide whether I like Lillian Ross or not. There is a strangely ambiguous atomosphere in this Portrait. It is impossible for me to tell if Ross is making fun of a sad, senile old alcoholic or if she is seriously hero-worshipping. Hemingway comes off very badly in any case. He keeps repeating the phrase, ""How do you like it now, gentlemen?"" and seems generally pretty unaware of his surroundings. I cant get past the feeling that Ross is exploiting H. for her own personal gain, but I suppose H. was not above doing the same to others himself in his younger days, so perhaps these things all even out."
5,Wonderful knife!,I bought this knife as a gift because I have used one just like it for years and its my favorite kitchen implement. Its very sturdy and holds its edge well despite all my abuse :-) This brand isn't one of the better known ones but it really should be as its quality is excellent!
3,4 months later,"After 4 months of weekends only use (I keep it at a cabin) this knife has given up sharpness to a degree that if I draw it across the cutting board it barely makes a scratch (bamboo board). I'm so disappointed! When it first arrived, it was lovely and sharp, and I figured I didn't need to take it for sharpening till 6 months had passed. Well, I will take it in, and I will update this review after that, but I was really hoping it would last a bit longer between sharpenings! I'm shopping today for a santoku and a paring knife, and will not be looking at this brand."
4,A Great Blast From The Past!,"This Is A Good Disc. I Highly Reccomend This For Everybody. My Only Complaint Is The Game Sega Swirl. I Mean, Why Would Sega Put A Game That Isn't A Classic On This Disc."
4,Classic!,"The Sega SmashPack has all your classic favorites! I bought it for the dirt cheap price and it was one of the best Dreamcast Buys ever. If you like classic games, SmashPack is for you. I hadn't played Sonic the Hedgehog for years, and I had loads of fun playing it on the SmashPack. And how can we forget Altered Beast and Golden Axe! These games are perfectly remade, exactly like the originals. Vectorman, Revenge of Shinobi, and my personal favorite, Streets of Rage 2. Buy the Sega Dreamcast Smash Pack! It's well worth it!"
3,What's with the sound?,"I'm a big fan of Phantasy Star 2. I bought this CD just for this great game. Golden Axe, Sonic the hedgehog and Virtua Cop 2 would be great bonuses, I thought. It turned out that the sound was so bad. It was nothing near the original version. I couldn't bear playing through the first dungeon.Be prepared. I was warned before but I thought it would be alright and that's not true.Did they try to pack too many titles (some are mediocre) in one disk by reducing the sound quality? If so, I have to say this is a horrible decision, indeed."
1,This accessories does not work with the fork lift,One would assume when you bought this with the fork lift it was meant to work with it. Nope! works with 3 other items. Deceptive. Now i have an accessory that is useless.I guess I missed the fine print!
5,Try it out indeed!!,"A wonderful collection of catchy melodies and thoughtful lyrics that will appeal to adults and children alike. Not only will this CD give your children (and Mom and Dad too!) hours of musical entertainment; it will also expose them to various forms of musical stylings from Pop, Jazz and Latin, to Celtic, lullabys and even Marchs! A sense of humour is never lacking as Mr. D'Addario leads us from one melodic gem to another. Oh, and there is a cameo from Mom too. A delight. Try out a CD. Try out a Song."
4,Great book for a maritime fan,"I recently bought this book and as a avid maritime fan, I enjoy it. There are plenty of items in the book and the photos are great. Short of going to the museum, this is as good as it gets!"
3,A new fan,"I recently purchased this CD and really liked several of the songs. There was one disappointment, though. I was hoping to hear the version of the ""Orange Blossom Special"" that was played with the children in the movie, ""Music From The Heart"". If you are looking for the same version as it was played in the movie, you won't find that one on this CD. That was disappointing for me. What you will get is a speeded up version which if you are into speeded up fiddle playing, you will like it. I enjoyed the songs on this CD that Celtic DANCING could be done to. There are a few songs on this CD that are way too fast-paced for my taste. I like music you can dance to or sit and listen to. The too fast paced music just makes me want to leave the room, but that's just me! I want to hear Orange Blossom Special played the way it was in the movie, ""Music From The Heart"". I'm still looking for it?"
1,Not a big winner with us.....,"My son received this for his 1st birthday. He's almost a year and a half now, and really has not played with this toy much. We are thinking about getting rid of it because, though it's not huge, it's just taking up space. It is very durable and cute, but my son just doesn't have much interest in it. I do like the little bins on the bottom to store blocks and other toys in."
1,"Do not buy this toy, it is dangerous","We bought this toy for my 17 month old son for Christmas. He really enjoyed playing with it. However, last night he put his arm all the way down the ball chute and got it caught. He started to panic and lurched back. If we were not right there to rescue him, he could have dislocated a shoulder. Also, the toy tips backwards, especially when he is pushing and pulling on the door that opens and closes. My son wieghs 24 pounds, slightly lighter for babies his age. I would not recommend this toy for anyone who has a baby that is pulling up on toys. If the toy were to fall back, the activity shelf would give him/her a good belt right in the gut."
1,The whole Story!,My son decided it would be fun to put his foot through the hole of the Little Tykes Workshop... I can't believe his foot even fit but yes it did.......... Ugh I am rattled to the bone still. That was madness.. Heart attack one of Parenthood... I don't like these.... I will be taking it back up to [the store] and filing a complaint for it to be recalled they shouldn't even have open holes like that to fit little feet through... And there is nothing that goes in those holes only if the shape is put through... The worst part is there is two sticking out clamps that when you try to pull his leg that way they are pointing in the opposite direction and clamp on his leg....
1,Boring Clutter,"Our 13 month old is not too interested in playing with the thing - but he does love to pull the door off the front and scatter the useless balls, trays, shapes, phone and hammer throughout the room. We are constantly picking up the pieces, re-attaching the door, and prying blocks and other toys out of the funnel-thingy every evening. The toy takes up more of our time than his!Do NOT recommend..."
5,"Good toy, but not very sturdy","My son got this when he was 5 months old and even at that time, he could pull it down on top of himself. Now he is ten months old and still loves it, but he seems to enjoy pulling it over to look at the back of it. Although it is lightweight, I'm afraid that he is going to hurt himself. A good way to use this toy with a younger infant is to have them practice kneeling at at while the parent sits behind the child to hold the toy steady and to catch the child if he falls backwards."
5,"Great, lasting, educational toy","This toy was a Christmas gift for my oldest son when he was 14months old. He could entertain himself for long periods of time placing the balls in the holes and seeing where they came out. He also had great fun banging the hammer on the shapes and listening for a response. He played with this every day and within a month he was telling me what shape he was hitting, ""tri-tri"", ""circle"", etc. This toy gave him great pride. It was his favorite (12-24mo)toy. Now his 7 month old brother is looking at it with interest. This toy is extremely durable and we have not had any problems with unsafe parts. I would highly recommend it. Fun, Fun, Fun!"
2,Not so great,"My son is almost a year old and he has had this toy since he was 8 months. Despite our encouragement, he does not seem interested in it. He plays with the balls, but the toy itself doesn't get any attention except from grown ups. Also, it is VERY UNSTABLE and falls over if he tries to pull up on it - which is the only time he touches it."
1,This toy has too many parts!,"Ugh! This toy is was a pain, all the pieces go missing. The shapes to hit are the first to go along with the hammer and buckets. I just thought it was a waste of money, all it was used for was to pull up to stand on, then of course it falls over."
5,favorite toy so far,"It's for 9 months to 3 years old, but we gave it to our 7 month old and it's his favorite toy. He plays with it all day long and loves the drawers and measuring slide. He loves playing with the hammer and phone. It's great but he does tip it over quite a bit."
5,"All day, over and over, for 1/2 a hour of more.",My 16 month old LOVES this. For the last seven months he has played with it constantly over and over every day.He adds his own small toys for variation. The electonic sounds break after awhile of little fingers poking them.We had to replace the peice where the shapes go because it would just sit there and make the funny little noises without anyone putting the blocks in the holes or being near it. It has no shut off switch. But we love it.
1,I thought I really liked this until my son's had got caught,"Hi,I Love Little Tikes toys and have several...but this toy unfortunately is unsafe in my opinion...The sound effects are great the colors are wonderful...and there is quite a bit for my son to learn and enjoy.The big problem that I found with this toy is on the end where my son likes to drop the balls into the circular container.The area is too small and when my son(12months) tries to put his hand inside to touch the balls his had gets stuck. It instantly throws my son into a panic and it isnt easy to get his hand out.. Safety is a Huge concern with this Mom as I am sure it is to many others. If the circle was larger this problem wouldn't occur...or maybe even take that end of the toy off...there is so much else to hold the childs attention. I am returning this product to the store and do not reccomend anyone else buying it until this problem is corrected...Again I do like Little Tykes products...just not this one."
3,Mixed reviews!!!,"My son of 9 months loves to push this little workshop all over the livingroom. He loves putting the balls in the slots and opening the little door. My complaint is that it is a little light weight and you really need to put it against something so that they won't tip over or come the other way and smack them in the face, both have happened to us. The sounds are not that great and have already broken ( with in 24 hrs.) I do not see this as a toy that he would be interested intil 36 months like the box says. Don't get me wrong my son does enjoy playing with this but I don't think I would buy it again if I could go back. If you are looking for something for your child to pull up on this is not the toy for you. Would be perfect for Grandma's house!!! Hope this helps somebody. I guess we live and learn."
4,One of my son's favorite toys.,"My son got this toy for Christmas when he was 11 months old. He loves to hit the shapes and put them in and out of the yellow and red buckets. Unfortunately, he also loves to climb up on it and it falls over VERY easily. I lean it up against the wall so it doesn't fall over while he is playing with it. He really loves this toy because he can build like daddy. I just wish it wasn't as light as it is."
3,My son's foot got stuck,"My son got this for Christmas shortly after his 1 year old birthday. He played with a lot until he got his foot stuck in one of the holes. He put his foot down in the hole and slid it past his ankle. We were unable to pull out his foot so we had to cut the toy to get his foot out. Little Tikes was very sorry about this happening, but I would not get another one for my son."
3,Hazard!,"My son received this toy as a Christmas present this year. Within one week he had cracked one of the storage bins. I'm concerned because the crack created a sharp point with the plastic and we had to take the bin away. The toy is rated from 9 to 36 months, and he's only 19 months--I can't imagine how well it can hold up to rougher play with older children.Better plastic would have eliminated this hazard altogether....I'm working this issue directly with the company."
2,This was a hit...for about twenty minutes.,"My son got this a year ago and tore into it like a madman. Once he did everything there was to do, he grew bored with it and just talked on the phone. The bench itself turned out to be my sons favorite stepstool."
4,Could be a lot sturdier,This toy is very good. My 9 mo daughter got one for christmas and that's the only toy that keeps her attention. My only complaint is that it's not sturdy at all. As soon as she leans on it (even if it's up against a wall) it falls over. When she plays with it someone has to always be right there to hold it against the wall. Other than that though it's great!
4,Great toy to keep baby entertained!!,"My ten-month-old son loves this! It keeps him entertained longer than his other toys seem to... There are lots of cool sounds and things to do with shapes and balls, like put them in the corresponding shape cut-out and slide the balls down a cute into the bins below. He always knows where to look... I definitley think this is an educational toy!My only complaint would be that it was a little smaller than I thought it was going to be. My ten-month-old is taller than the toy and has to squat down to its level to play... It also tends to fall over when he puts weight on it... He hasn't gotten hurt, I just have to make sure it is against something. It is light enough, though, for him to move around himself, which I have caught him doing many times! :) I think he will have fun with it as he grows, I just wish is were a little bit bigger and heavier so it would stay put!"
3,Where are the pieces?,"This toy I was positivly going to be a hit with my son of eighteen months, and it met my expectations for a short while after he recieved it on Christmas. What went wrong was that the pieces could be found (or worse, not found) in every corner of the house. The tool bench is then just an empty shell which is not very entertaining. The phone didnt fit in the holder which was kind of frustrating for my son and there were some other warped areas of the toy. I would not say everyone would have the same problems, but if your house is more chaos then calm you probably will find yourself asking, ""Now where are the pieces."""
5,The gift that keeps on giving,"My mom bought this for my 9 month old son and there hasn't been a day when he hasn't played with it. He has had some older friends over (11 month old girl and 2 year old boy) who also were happy to play with it for some time. From this we can deduce that it will entertain him even as he gets bigger. There are some things he couldn't do when he began playing with it, but he has learned how. It's wonderful to see his mind working!The only drawback is that he tries to pull himself up, or hold himself up, on the toy and it is not that stable. I solved the problem by making sure there is something sturdy behind the toy -- like a wall or an end table."
2,Very Disappointed,This toy was built cheap and my 10 month old son was bored with it and had the shapes lost within the day.
1,What's the BIG DEAL!!??,"My son got this toy for a 1st birthday gift. He loves it, AS A STEP STOOL!!!! He never plays with it, only to climb the thing to reach the unreachable. It is cute though, and might be good for a less active toddler. It makes noises, and I like the bright colors and shape sorting aspect, but really it's not worth 30.00."
1,This one's for the trash - TOO DANGEROUS!!,"I purchased this toy for my son last year when he was about 14 months old, and while he seemed to enjoy figuring out all the activities, he also liked to CLIMB on it. Like others have said it is very lightweight, and obviously not meant for climbing on, but tell that to a toddler...well he tried to climb it one night and he foot popped right through the shape sorter and got STUCK...an hour of screaming and greasing and maneuvering later (I was also 8 months pregnant at the time which made the maneuvering interesting) he FINALLY came loose. I was just about to give up and take him to the ER with the toy attached to his leg! The underside of the shape sorter holes are rough as well, and he had bruises and cuts all up and down his shin/ankle. It immediately went into the basement and then to the dump! My niece also got her head stuck in a Little Tikes Cozy Coupe and ended up in the ER...I will never again buy Little Tikes..."
3,"The toy is great, but shipping on the other hand...","I ordered this toy for my son as a Christmas gift. I failed to notice the note that says, ""may be shipped in manufacturers packaging"". Well, it was. A nice fat packaging invoice covering up two sides of the box with super-sticky tape. Holes are in 2 corners of the box. Basically, it looks like the poor toy took a trip to hell and back before it made it to my house. You would think with the $9.00+ shipping charge, Amazon could afford to supply a cardboard box...Very disappointed"
1,UNSAFE!,"My son (18 months) enjoyed this, but liked to use the shelf to step up onto, and got his foot stuck in the round hole. We had to cut the toy open to free his foot. The maker was notified, and they picked up the toy vias UPS and replaced it with another item. I'm surprised this is still for sale, it really hurt his foot and ankle. (the maker was very apologetic and responsive, so I'd likely buy from them again.)"
2,not so great,I was not impressed with this toy. It doesn't do much. The pieces get seperated and lost easily. My three toddlers used it as a bench to sit on more than they played with it as intended.
5,One of my son's favorites!,"We received this as a 1st birthday present for my son and it is now one of his many favorites! He loves putting the balls in the drill press, and yanking on the drop lever (and believe me, he YANKS and it is still functioning). I like that the sounds are cute but not annoying. My only problem with this, as with ALL toys, are the various pieces get dragged halfway across the house LOL It is a bit lightweight too, so he's managed to knock it over a few times but no harm done to him or to the toy. A note: the green tray that holds the shapes/sound mechanisms...it WON'T come out if you READ the DIRECTIONS which tell you to SCREW it to the BASE! I'm sure my son will be enjoying this toy as long as it will withstand his aggressive and enthusiastic playing."
2,Buddhism Colonized,"The format and layout of this book is well done, and it is a descent quick reference guide for terms. What I disliked about this book (starting on page 3 ""The Vedic Religion"") is that the author goes out of his way to link Indian accomplishments to fanciful European or non Indian influences without any citation or even a plausible theory. This causes the non novice practitioner of Buddhism to question even the most basic facts presented by the author. Max Mueller, Thomas McCully Aryan invasion theory was based on pseudo science and racism, and has been disproven by archeological evidence. why is it being present in this book as fact? The Vedas never even mentions an Aryan homeland. If I were an invader I think I would make sure my history and origin was keep alive. Buddhism can be claimed by all for the enlightenment of the self it does not need to be stolen. Respect the ingenuity and creativity of others."
1,What have we done to deserve this?,"The Pet Shop Boys are some of the best pop songwriters around, so WHY on earth would they accept a song written by the infamous, middle-of-the-road (I'm trying hard not to type ""hack"" here)composer, Diane Warren? And she didn't even write it for them! They only got it after other, wiser groups rejected it! Buy the album (which is excellent), skip this regretable single, and marvel at how amazing it is that Neil & Chris have given so much first-rate material over the decades. They are peerless."
1,I'm shocked,"I really can't believe the Pet Shop Boys would release THIS song as a single off their stellar album, ""Fundamental."" This song is the weakest song on the entire album. It's so slow that I want to fall asleep, and if anyone has a mental illness or suicidal tendencies, I'd highly advise that you don't listen to it.What the PSB should have done was release INTEGRAL as the next single. I'm still waiting for that one. That would've been the next logical single to come out. With this release of ""Numb,"" that's exactly what my attitude has become to these boys."
3,The holder didn't stay stuck!,My cats love it and I really wanted some entertainment for the times when I'm away from home. So I've got to find a better hanger.
5,A lot of play for a little price.,"My friend Amy told me about this years ago. It's such a plain looking thing, but oh my! My cat, after 10 years, is ready for another. I've actually bought several over the years because she keeps taking them and I can't find them! Cat Dancer makes a wonderful little gift to a kitty parent...my cat actually plays until she has to quit because she is panting.It's just wire and little twisted brown paper...not much to look at; but then, the colorful toys are mostly to please US, not them. This has been her favorite toy for 10 years, and I've bought a LOT of cat toys in that time.Cat Dancer 101 Cat Dancer Interactive Cat Toy"
2,i didn't get the paw mount...,"so i can't say if that bit is good or not (even tho it is shown in the product photo, i didn't receive it). this upset me because i would've ordered from someone else. anyway, this toy has always been a fave with my friends' cats, so i'm giving it a try. it has a tendency to hit kitty in the head and make him not want to play with it, so i'm looking for one of those leather strings instead, which other people's cats also seem to enjoy consistently. i just have a silly old cat!"
4,Nice low-tech cat toy.,"None of my cats can resist this toy, although they ignore it when anchored to the wall; they only like it when I hold it wiggle or drag it around them."
2,Not as pictured,Item does not include the wall mount paw as pictured. Other vendors sell this exact item for two dollars less on Amazon.
1,cat dancer product,MY CATS HAVE NO INTEREST IN THIS AT ALL. IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD TOY BUT THEY DONT LIKE IT.
2,Be careful where you mount this,"Just buy this cat dancer toyCat Dancer Products Original Interactive Cat Toyand forget the wall-mount style.I thought I'd be lazy and buy the wall-mount cat dancer - I stuck the wall-mount part of it on the back of my bedroom door and the adhesive sticks way too much; no matter what I use to try and remove it, the residue and part of the foam will not come off the door. The cats quickly lost interest playing with it this way, they want ME to interact with them. I have more fancy moves than a stationary cat dancer mounted to a wall or door.Plus I also think it's a bad idea to make this a toy where you do not supervise the cat's play - the cardboard tubing eventually shreds and the bare wire can be dangerous to your cat.Original Cat Dancer: 5 starsOriginal Cat Dancer with Wall Mount: 2 stars - just use it as the original and forget the wall mount."
4,A fine album indeed,"This is another album like Legs Diamond's Fire Power that I did not buy for a long time due to mixed reviews. Just like LD's third album some fans thought Starz had sold out. While I think that Starz second album (and LDs) is their best, this album contains some classic 70s rockers. So Young, So Bad is an excellent song with a great verse and chorus (check out Mayday's version from 1981 as well, it smokes!). Take Me is a sleazy rocker with some classic lyrics from Mr. Smith. My Sweet Child is a well-written ballad. Outfit is a catchy song that I think most guys can relate to. My favorite song is probably Last Night I Wrote A Letter, I love that chorus! Coliseum Rock is a decent instrumental and It's A Riot is a cool tune. This album is certainly a fine piece of 70s hard rock worth owning."
1,Do not buy this book,"This book is copyright 1997. There is nothing in this book that has not been superceded. Even the code ""samples"" (which are few) have nothing to do with current extranet development. Pass this book by. Save your money."
1,POOR QUALITY CHEW,DO NOT BUY THIS CHEW if you have a large dog that knows how to chew!! My G S PUPPY destroyed this item in [3] days! returned it to amazon for a full refund.
5,"Factual, Humorous, Insider Stuff, Great Characters, Great Read","Author Steven Gaines's The Sky's the Limit: Passion and Property in Manhattan is a delightfully charming and seriously factual insiders guide to the nuances and eccentricity of selling/buying New York City's high priced, top tier real estate. It is immensely readable levened with the author's humor and insight. It is also a very interesting history of the wealthy landowners occupying upper Fifth Avenue, the exclusive Eastside and sections of Central Park West and how it all evolved. For me, someone who loves NYC and lived there (9th Avenue, East of Fifth Avenue) from 1973 to 1980, it was a revelation of the hugh wealth it requires to live in the ""right"" places or buildings and the ruthless nature of the people who sell exclusive NYC real estate."
3,Very selective Cooperative Board Committees,This book is fairly engrossing. It's amazing how selective the boards of these buildings can be and how careful a prospect has to be in an interview even if they meet wealth and income requirements. This book could serve as a preparatory guide for those about to go before a cooperative board for the first time.
2,"interesting topic, poorly executed","Gaines' prose is all over the place. I was also yearning for some footnotes to legitmate some of his stories. The topic is quite interesting-- I only hope I can find a version of this tackled by a legitimate historian or if that does not yet exist, that an historian will take on this feat."
3,Can you say Snobs?,"Buying real estate in Manhattan is like buying real estate nowhere else in the world: a hoity-toity book called the Social Register dictates who can live where; co-op boards in luxury buildings often require a buyer to have at least 20 times the price of the apartment in assets; and the cost of an apartment rarely holds any relationship to the true value of the space. Indeed, Manhattan real estate is a cutthroat, baffling but thrilling world, and Gaines takes readers on a spectacular ride through it. Real estate done by the social register, Gaines implies, may be a thing of the past. His last chapter focuses on a new breed of Manhattan brokers, those who are solely interested in racking up sales. A gossipy, entertaining peek into a glam world."
1,Sad and poorer after buying this book.,The book in my opinion simply dropped the ball. Why? I could probably name 100 reasons after reading. It simply does not measure up.
3,Drip spout can be better,SHAKE WELL before use. when you tip over the bottle the oil will just pour out so it will get all over the place.
4,Smooth but heavy,"Does stay clean, and rides smoothly, but it feels like it creates more friction than oil based lubricants (used to use Tri-flo)."
2,Better than nothing,"Might be good for long term storage to prevent rust, but as a lubricant it is very poor. WD-40 and olive oil are better choices for actually riding. Chain waxes may be appropriate for motorcycles, but for human powered bicycles every watt is precious. This crap at least doubles drive line losses."
5,I absolutely love it!!,"I had purchased a Kodak Easyshare a year or two ago. It's not a bad camera. But, I needed something that can fit into my purse, yet, not be too tiny or uncomfortable for my fingers. When I saw this Canon Power Shot, I bought it. And have absolutely no regrets, its small, compact and does all a standard size camera does. It takes beautiful pictures, colors are so true to life. One would be amazed of the quality this camera gives off. I love it and HIGHLY recommend it too others! I can assure them, they won't be disappointed. And, another good part is, its not too expensive. The price is right."
3,Teenie-Weeie print,"I was very disappointed with the print size. Anyone old enough to remember the Beatles will certainly be reaching for their reading glasses. The notation and lyrics are both a bit smaller than newsprint. One more thing, the first song I tried was ""A Day In The Life"". I thought everything seemed accurate except on ""...they had to count them all..."" the chords are listed as C C Aug 7th and the chord chart shows C F."
2,I love the Beatles...,"But really, the notes in the book are way too smal & I don't need glasses btw. The notes are teeny tiny!&The; book needs to be bigger.as it doesn't open up properly so how would I even put it on my piano stand?The only option is to hold the book in one hand and play with the other. & That's silly because obviously pianists play with two hands!!Sorry but this is a definite return.I am saddened as I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Beatles.Apparently there is another Score book to purchase, that's for the recommendation Amazon.Hopefully with notes that I can read from the piano bench!God Bless John, Paul, George, and RIngo. MWAH"
3,text needs to be bigger. need to make it so the pages dont shut,good but text needs to be bigger and they need to bind it so the pages turn easily and stay there.
5,This book has everything,"Great book for musicians and fans a like. word by word, note by note. Composers would also enjoy this book as part of their collection."
3,Good but for reference only,"It's a good and complete book for all Beatles fans. It's got tabs for all instruments, guitars, bass and drum. For reference it's good but to play and read as you are playing, it's crap because of it's small size, 8.5'' X 11'' and it's scripted small too."
3,false advertising,"1) SCORES do NOT include tablature. Musical illiterates do not read SCORES.2) ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"" are NOT Beatles songs: the Beatles's founder, the most intelligent, creative, and interesting Beatle, was not around to approve their release. This book DOES include some sort of transciption of EVERY song commercially released by the Beatles during the time the Beatles were extant.3) The errors in this book ARE significant. You can almost choose any song at random. Take ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", for instance: The bass line is accurate for the first verse only, not for the first refrain, not for subsequent verses, not for subsequents renderings of the refrain. Why is this significant? Because Paul McCartney's bass is not randomly deviating for the sake of variety: McCartney is much more of a musician than that; he is deliberately and methodically building up musical tension: a song needs to GO somewhere."
4,The Beatles - Complete scores review,"The Beatles - Complete Scores is in fact ""complete."" for those of you wanting a book that would be used as a reference have found a great book. However, those of you who actually intend to play from this book should look elsewhere. The print has been reduced from standard ""score"" size and is too small to read at the piano. The book is too big to open and have it stay open."
4,Must be pretty accurate...,"I've been playing Beatle songs in bands for 43 years. Most of us older guys learned the guitar parts by listening to the records which wasn't easy considering most of the recordings were mixed in mono and made deciphering the separate guitar parts really difficult. And, very few of us ever really learned the solos correctly, note-for-note. A few years ago, I played in a band with a brilliant 16 year old girl guitarist who could sight-read and play her butt off. She'd never really studied the Beatles or played their songs, but she came to rehearsal with this book and played the Beatles' stuff more accurately than I'd ever heard anyone else play it. I can't read music and most of my bandmates can't either. The ""charts"" in this book must be pretty accurate given how good the songs sounded when this girl read and played them."
5,The best compilation of its kind!,"Who would have guessed someone had enough time on their hands to transcribe every Beatle song. However, the task has been done and done brilliantly! Any four-piece can now get incredibly close to playing exactly what the Liverpudlians did thirty years ago! But don't be fooled, this is not like other books! This not only contains the rhythm and vocal transcriptions, this even charts the sound effects, miscellaneous instrumentation, and any other sonic production of the recordings the Brits blessed us with. This is not just a must-have collector's item--this deserves to be purchased just because someone(s) devoted an exhausting amount of time putting this together for people who range from remotely interested to the addicted and fettished!"
3,A worthy effort,"I will say that an undertaking of transcribing all the Beatles songs is quite a difficult task. This book does a fairly decent job of getting things correct. 2 Complaints First ,the format makes it difficult in some cases, to read. I have ( or had prior to getting this book) good eyes, but I find myself squinting at many of the pages. I'd rather pay a little extra if this was in a larger format with bigger font. Second, If it says complete scores, then all the notes should be there, I have found many errors in just the first week that I have had this book, most notably in the bass parts. Look at ""While my Guitar Gently Weeps"" what is written sounds fine, but it's not what on the record.It is a fun book, but don't think you are getting complete accuracy, and be prepared for a little eye strain."
3,THIS BOOK NEEDS TO BE EDITED AND REVISED!,"This is a classic book. It's the most talked about rock sheet-music book in score format. But it has ALOT of mistakes (duh!)! Some of the songs are way off - especially the songs with more than 4 instruments! The transcriptions are sloppy. And being handwritten makes the pages look ugly. I think Barnes Music Engraving Ltd. should go through the entire Beatles catalogue and transcribe all of the albums! The ""Off The Record"" series are, for lack of a better word, perfect! The Beatles Complete Scores should at least be revised and edited. They need it! This book is far too important to be left alone! Please, guys, edit this book until it is perfect! How 'bout it Hal Leonard?"
5,Amazing. Binding easy to fix.,"As previous reviewers have said, the transcriptions aren't perfect, but the errors are minor enough that anyone with enough of an ear to notice them can fix them. For the amount that this collection is an absolutely awe-inspiring piece of work, I don't think that a few minor errors should count against it.Many reviewers have had issues with the binding being too thick and the book too big and cumbersome to balance on a music stand. I fixed this problem by simply taking the book to a copy shop and having them rebind it for me into three volumes. It only cost me ten dollars and it has made my life infinitely easier."
2,Print to small,This book has everything you would want within it. The problem is the font is so small there is no way it can actually be used. No kidding.
4,Where's the revision??,"Yeah, there are errors; but with so much of it right on, me thinks it's as much a printer's error rather than the transcriber's error. And sure the font could be bigger, but then you'd have to have 2 or 3 volumes, and 2 or 3 times the cost. Overall, an outstanding attempt to capture the Fab Four's sound on paper. Now, where's the revision??"
4,A better Beatles book - finally!,"I was pretty anxious to receive this book after reading the reviews and ordering it. I had researched other Beatles song boks and publications for lyrics and music and found that the others were not as complete as I would like. ""The Beatles - Complete Scores"" (hard cover) has everything I was looking for and more: chords, lyrics, Tab, and music score - with one problem. The book is printed in a small type and is difficult to read. As I sit with a guitar in hand, the book at arms length, initial read-throughs are tough. The main advantage for me is that the book is 98% complete and accurate. I can work out the basics and, if need be, reproduce it at a larger scale. For all it contains, the somewhat compact size is helpful and the high construction and print quality will add many years of life to its use. (I would have rated it at 4.5 or 5 if not for the small print size.)"
5,Excellent,"Apart of the mini size of the capital letters, apart of the small space for the scores, this book is absolutely necessary if you play guitar, bass, drums or piano. And, obviously, if you are a Beatles fan."
5,The Beatles Complete Scores,"Amazing book with every song ever written, performed or recorded by the Beatles. A great resource. I had to buy it for my Music Theory class, and there's no way I'd sell it again."
3,Only a good start towards playing great songs.,"The music covered in this book is wonderful, of course, but if you have a good ear you'll find many instances where you won't believe what you see on the page. A fairly simple example is ""No Reply."" The song is in a minor key, and if you have a trained ear, you know the chords are minor chords - - but the music is written here with all major chords. In addition, on the recording you'll hear sevenths which the sheet music doesn't mention.The format could also be easier - - the songs are ordered alphabetically, but if you don't use the table of contents to find a song it will be difficult: the top margins don't have any key words to indicate the songs on the page.But if you have a good ear, and are adequately suspicious of what you see on the page, the book will be a time saver. And for that, it's worth the money."
3,The Beatles Complete Score 5 to 2 = 3,"Who gives this Five Stars your nuts! Yes, it is very accurate and helpful. You do need a magnifying glass if you were really there in 1963 like I was. Now if you are under 25 and just discovering the Fab Four you can probably read it ok. I am taking this thing apart and I am going to Kinko's and make my own large print edition. I'm going to do it a little bit at a time each week. The publisher really screwed up with the format or did they? I still paid about $70.00 when it first came out so I guess they didn't screw up. I would of gladly paid $100.00 for larger print and pages you can actually lay flat."
1,BEWARE - Have a Magnifier,"Well the title explains that the print is so small that if you are over 45, you will have difficulty reading the music. Yes it is detailed with everything you need.If you buy it and decide that you cant read it - be prepared to only get 50% of the cost refunded to you. They consider if you remove the sulfate plastic that it is not in the same condition as received.BEWARE Beatles Fans!!!!"
1,About the small print size,"For those of you complaining about the miniscule print size (and absolutely right to do so - quite ridiculous!), why aren't you simply returning the book for a refund? I did this and was refunded immediately. It's NOT fit for the purpose, so get your money back, then maybe the publishers will listen to the customers a bit more closely."
2,Uneccessary,"I reccomend getting this book only if you want it to have...not to play from. The Beatles are great but it's impossible to get a feel for their music by playing from this book. They often played with several guitars and overdubbed alot, particularly in their later work. Therefore, trying to play many of their songs from this book is incomplete unless you have a whole band to play with. The INCREDIBLY small print is a pain to read as well. I would reccomend getting The Beatles Complete Chord Book instead. It's not in tab form, but if you are good enough to play most of their stuff, you can probably figure out the picking/soloing yourself. If you are still not satisfied, there are alot of good free websites with guitar tabs that have most of their songs, including good versions of Dear Prudence, Blackbird, Julia etc. The version of Blackbird wasn't even that good in this book. So, in conclusion, this is really only for the collector."
3,Hal Leonard Strikes again,"The book is really neat to have, but as a guitarist of 10 years, I just found too many mistakes to even take the book seriously. I just find it ridiculous that this can be published in this state. Regular folk and musicians alike have been admiring, worshipping, and studying all aspects of The Beatles for many years, yet a 20-year old casual musician like myself opens the book and finds laughable mistakes in just minutes. Good material to have, but purchase with caution, especially because of the hefty price tag."
3,"""read the small print""",...yes the print is very small.Yes it has every Beatles song.Yes I did enjoy the transcriptions.I would have paid more for a larger book with larger type.
5,Best Beatles Transcriptions,"The most comprehensive book of Beatles music, this is the end all. Transcriptions are perfect, all instruments are transcribed, and it still gives guitar tab and chord boxes for those so notationally inclined."
3,"sketches, not ""scores""; still useful; still recommended","This is filled with inaccuracies and sketchy. I don't doubt the transcriber labored much, but a work such as this requires a team of transcribers comparing versions, some basic research, and--most important--careful editing. It is the responsibility of the publisher to make sure its books are what it claims they are. This is a collection of sketches, not of scores.Compare this transcription of ""Eleanor Rigby"" with George Martin's score printed (in part) in his ""All You Need is Ears"". George Martin probably keeps a library of his Beatle arrangements. Why didn't the publisher contact him? The frequent and often nonsensical mangling of lyrics is inexcusable. Compare the clarinet rhythms on the recording of ""When I'm 64"" to what is mis-notated here. Listen to ""Blackbird"": that's not a bass drum; that's McCartney tapping his foot. I could go on.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,Binding and print make it unsuitable to its purpose,"I have to say I'm exceedingly disappointed with this book. Not so much the content, but the packaging and rendering. It's about the size and shape of and bound like the average collegiate dictionary. That's fine for a dictionary where you open it, look up a word, and close it. But this format is totally unsuitable for a music book that you would want on a piano or music stand. And like a dictionary, the print is tiny. For me it's too small to try to follow and learn while playing an instrument. And, again, because of its binding it doesn't even lend itself to placing on a copier and enlarging. I'm even contemplating cutting the pages out with a razor so I can feed them into a copier and enlarge.The Beatles music is a lot of material to cover and the author did a good job of compiling it. But it really needs to be split across multiple volumes, printed on large paper, and spiral bound to lay flat on a music stand."
1,Printed for collectors rather than musicians,"When this boxed, hard-bound volume arrived, I thought it was a bit on the small side to use for reading music, and my disappointment deepened when I opened the book. The paper is of lesser quality, the printing is small and also of less than distinctive quality. On the plus side, this volume would probably satisfy a collector but not someone who wanted to use it to perform music. Historical record perhaps but not a useful publication for a musician to use"
4,"Not perfect, but impressive nonetheless","I can only speak to this as a piano player. I've had a lot of fun with this book, playing various or multiple parts on piano. It is comprehensive, covering every Beatles song and every instrument for those songs. While bands or groups might find more use from this than I did, I still found several songs that were very playable and better than any other sheet music out there.There are a couple drawbacks. First, the print size is small. It's not impossible to read, but sometimes it takes a second glance to see what it is. Once you learn the song, however, this should not be a problem. Secondly, because it is written for all instruments, it can be difficult to use this music to play a song on just one instrument. You have to integrate different parts to make it sound like it's supposed to. Some songs lend themselves to this better than others.Overall, for musicians who are fans of the Beatles, this is a must have."
3,Smudged,The book is great for people wanting to learn and play Beatles songs which they haven't quite been able to find before. Only problem was when i opened up the book i found a few pages smudged and couldn't replace the item.
1,Poor.,"I recently got myself a second-hand copy for 10 (and I even grudge paying that much!) thinking that if I'm going to criticise something, it should at least be with some authority.This book is awful. I have yet to find one transcription which doesn't have at least one major error. Even the relatively simple earlier songs are badly transcribed. There are many wrong voicings of chords, capoed parts written without capos ('Nowhere Man', 'Michelle'), missed notes and missed parts.As for the later songs, the transcription of the piano part for 'Lady Madonna' is a joke and the other piano parts are well wide of the mark. Also, the fact that George Martin's groundbeaking orchestrations are reduced to single, cursory staves marked 'strings' or 'brass' is wholly inadequate.This is an expensive book which does not live up the claim on its cover. Anyone buying this book thinking it is a definitive work will be disappointed."
4,Great book but agree with format problems... could be solved with electronic version,"Obviously the book is great and the transcriptions are excellent and almost too comprehensive (tab for Revolution #9? Really? lol) Worth money for the attention paid to the vocal harmonies alone. But since a large percentage of Beatles fans are, to put it kindly, ""of a certain age"" then I think this needs to be addressed.An electronic version of this book which could be zoomed solves every problem and eliminates the high cost pf printing such a big volume. It would also be great if you could isolate particular parts.So c'mon, publisher, some of us want to buy this book AGAIN, in electronic format. You're leaving money on the table!"
4,"Truly remarkable content, but tough for musicians to use","This book is a terrific achievement. But the small print and hardcover binding make it tough for musicians to use as a practical resource. At the least, the book should be published with a durable soft cover and sturdy spiral binding so it can be laid flat on a piano or music stand."
4,Beatles Complete Score - Scores,This is an awesome book showing the arrangements for many of the instruments covering all of the beatles songs. I only wish the print were larger as at my age it is hard to read at any distance.
5,Beatles Fan,"This book was suggested by a musician friend for my 20 year old son. He was so surprised and loved it all - he has been consumed by music for the past 5-6 years, writes his own music and lyrics for accoustic and electric guitar, as well as sings. This was a great gift for any music lover!"
1,I dont know what is happening,"the product isn't in my hand yet, the mail didn't came to my adress, today is dec 28José Carlos"
4,Beatles for intermediate musicians,"The work that went into this is impressive, but it is not every note from every album. The harmonies are notes picked from chords and don't include the subtle nuances that were unique to the singers. There are minor mistakes, typos, that will keep you on your toes and the notes about capos, alternate tunings and why the band recorded a few songs in cumbersome keys could be a little more explicit. That being said, it's a wonderful , all-in-one reference book. It would challenge all but the expert musician to improve their Beatles knowledge. The only other warning is this: the print is fine. You old codgers out there with reading glasses will need plenty of light to follow the notation."
3,Beatles,"I should have considered the comments of other reviewers who said the print was too small - IT IS. OK, the book is great but not as user friendly as others."
4,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!","I wish I'd bought this when it first showed up on bookshelves in the early '90's. My eyesight was better then!Good collection, well orchestrated, but as others have said - very fine print. Adding the full orchestration compounds the problem by spreading the songs over too many tiny pages.I also own ""Beatles: Complete"" published by Warner Music in the mid-seventies ($12.95 then). While it is much less accurately transcribed, and lacks the scoring, it is MUCH easier to read.This book should come with a gift card good for unlimited enlargements from your nearest Kinko's. Once properly enlarged, I'd give it five stars."
5,Most useful item I own!,"This book is great. Ive run into a few mistakes, but not enough for me to give this less than five stars. The fact that its handwritten gives it a great look. I'm obsessed with the Beatles, and if anyone else out there feels the same way they should buy this book. ... You should also probably know how to play an instrument."
5,Clever Book!,"A superbly weaved story that provides a clever and unexpected conclusion, packed with all the twists, turns and copious quantities of thrills and action we expect from our fiction writers. A great read to all lovers of fast paced, cleverly constructed thrillers"
4,A Great Read,"Downloaded the the sample and was immediately pulled in. Deftly written, the author makes his characters very believable and the scenarios they encounter more than plausible. Nice use of dialogue which draws you in and you burn through the pages at a pace which does damage to your sleep pattern, but which leaves you looking forward to the knowledge that there might be a sequel to this book waiting in your ""books to be read pile."" I only hope that his imagination and his energy level remain high, so that he can keep drawing us through his world of danger, espionage and intrigue.The only downfall was in character development; though he made them believable, I feel as though he could have expanded in this area just a bit more."
3,Good story poorly copy-edited,"While this story was reasonably compelling, the spelling, punctuation, grammar and all manner of mistakes made the book seem as though it had been written by a person for whom English was a second language and not copy-edited at all. I found the errors so distracting that it completely spoiled the book for me. I've noticed errors in other Kindle books, but this was ridiculous!"
2,"Great story, poor writing","I'm right there with William. It was a great story, kept moving, wasn't too formula, took some unexpected turns, but.......The grammar was atrocious. There was some kind of problem on every page. William outlined some, I found those and some really offensive ones like,...for all intensive purposes. It's for all intents and purposes, or...they detonate on. Which should have been one, not on....speak you mind. Do I need to explain this one?...as a big rig blew by during 70 miles per hour. What? Maybe ""doing""?The problem was all these errors were in 2 Kindle pages! I can understand one or two typo's in an entire book, but this was worse than a high school paper. I'm sure it would have been an ""F"".I like to speed read, and I had to keep stopping to check out the mistakes and figure out what was intended. Liked the plot, but someone needs an editor."
3,So-so performance after a year of use. Uses to avoid.,"Executive summary: don't expect the claimed 10,000 hours lifespan, al least if you live in a warm southern climate like mine. Investment return is questionable...your results may vary, and savings, if any, of course depends on the cost of your power.When new these are generally very nice bulbs that have a pleasing color temperature and color spectrum closely similar to incandescents. I've run about 30 of them for a year, and have found they get gradually dimmer--in about 40% of cases too dim to continue to operate--after just one year (3000 hrs.; about 8 hrs. per day). The color shifts to pinkish in most cases.Also do not use these in fixtures that hug the white (electronics) portion of the bulb too snugly, or fixtures like glass globes that prevent all air flow and thus, cooling. The bulb's own operating heat kills its electronics in a couple months in that sort of fixture."
3,Large bulb,"These pear shaped bulbs are quite large in diameter. This is a problem in many of the lamps in my house, since the wire frame that holds the lamp is made to fit a standard bulb. Also the ""Cool White"" bulbs have a very fluorescent look to them - perhaps the ""warm light"" bulbs look better. I have used the GE helical fluorescent bulb and really like the light and the performance they offer but thought I might try a different bulb. The GE helical bulb has no flicker and similar delay to this bulb. I prefer the helical florescent over this bulb."
4,Beginner Swim,"I could never figure out how to change the nose piece. The goggles came with various sizes but I didn't want to break the goggles so I just kept the original nose piece attached. Otherwise, googles are fine."
4,"Pretty good, for the one day that I had them","Accidentally left them behind in the locker room, so I didn't get to use them for long. They fit me great, they cupped my eyes, like goggles are supposed to, and they didn't leak."
3,"no leaks, but fogs up bad.","These goggles are pretty, and they fit securely on my face.The only thing i don't like about them is that they fog up pretty bad, and i can't see where i'm swimming!"
3,Broke in only three months,"I liked these goggles when I first got them but after only three months of swimming with them, the spot on the eyepiece where the nose piece fits snapped. They also got foggy really quick. I took care of them by following the directions too. I would recremend these goggles to someone who does light swimming."
2,They get scratched VERY easily,"I keep my goggles in a pouch, but they still managed to get badly scratched. I've had them for about 8 months but the internal scartches have become a problem.Other than that, they are leak-proof, and do not usually fog up unless I swim on my back.Also, they are either too tight and create a blue circle around my eyes, or too loose and let water in a times...Good goggles overall, but definitely lacking."
4,Speedo Womens Vanquisher Swim Goggle (Clear),THEY WERE A GIFT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND WHO IS A BIG SWIMMER AND SHE HAS BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THEM.
1,frustrated,"I have contacted, or at least attempted to contact, this seller twice since receiving this item. It arrived without the nose pieces which renders it impossible to use. It is very painful, water leaks in and simply not usable. Not sure whether the seller is even getting my feedback, as Amazon is interfering asking me not to give negative feedback but to contact seller first. This is happening with another item as well. So, perhaps this would be easily resolved if the ""old"" method of Seller contact was still in place.The goggles are lovely-looking and I do not doubt that if I got nose pieces they would be great.WILL THIS SELLER EVER CONTACT ME????????????????? GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
1,swimming blind,I bought these goggles to wear at the Y for a year membership. Began swimming about a month ago two to three times per week and the goggles constantly fog up. I tried everything I could think of to fix the problem and asked others for their feedback. Nothing worked. I finally was so frustrated after a swimming session that I took the goggles and threw them in the trash in the dressing room. I do not recommend these goggles. Went to Target and bought another pair and they are just great. No fogging.
1,foggy!,What's wrong with mine! I ordered the product based on many positive reviews. Just couple times using it and it's foggy.
1,"everything looks magnified, ant-fog fails","the first time I swam with these it took a little getting used to. in the water everything looks magnified, it was disorienting because the object in front of you is much closer than it appears through the goggles. and the issue only exists when viewing under water. the first couple of lap I swam I had issue in judging when I was going to hit the wall.also this pair of goggle has quite a bit of blind spot, you can't really see around you unless you really turn your head. this is due to the small lens.only good thing about this goggle is the anti-fog, no more stopping between laps to adjust goggle. but I would definitely not purchase the vanquisher again. I will stick with my old aqua sphere kaiman, which has much larger lens and no weird magnifications.EDIT: anti-fog coating failed after just 2 weeks. Horrible goggles, half way down a lap and I could barely see anything other than my hands. Will never purchase again. Completely useless in water."
2,"great fit, but fogs up","i bought these for my wife as i have the first vanquisher and have nothing but good things to say about them. however, for both me and the wife both lenses of the vanquisher 2.0 fog up within 10-15 seconds in a pool. i switched out the nose piece to a narrower one to see if that would resolve the problem but got no better results. i am disappointed."
3,Swim Goggle,"It's not as comfortable as I thought it would be. It's ok, but it's pretty hard to adjust."
5,Now I can see,"The Speedo Vanguisher is the best goggle I've ever owned. I've had it for half a year, and I go to the pool a few times a week, and my goggle still doesn't fog up. It is completely watertight, so I can wear contacts and not worry about the chlorine irritating my eyes or my contacts washing away. The rubber padding and string are quite comfortable, as well. One can see quite well with these!"
1,Impossible,"How did any of you change the nose piece size? My fingers are red and sore after trying any way possible to remove the original strap, and I only got one side to finally come out. I wish Speedo would have made it easier to adjust this part."
5,Awesome,Great goggle for the price. I love the pink. Comes in many great colors. Awesome customer service. I rec'd my order 2 days after ordering it!
3,"Comfortable, worked til it fell apart","The soft silicone eyes gaskets came undone from the frame after 2 swims. Til then, I really liked them. And they're pretty."
3,Swim Goggle,At first I thought this was a great product. Yet at the end of my swim I found my nose bone a little bit hurting. The goggles were pushing too hard on one side (I don't think my bone is sticking out more than usual). I normally only write positive reviews but I decided to make a mentioning. They look great which is why I still give it 3 stars. And I will still use them as they do a good job otherwise.
4,OK but not anti-fog,"I've worn these about 10 times now, swimming laps in a pool. I didn't touch the insides, & rinsed off the chlorine, hoping the anti-fog would last, but it disappeared after the second swim. A little saliva works ok, tho, if you're not opposed to being a bit gross. Once I got the right nose-piece in place, they have worked well & fit comfortably enough, altho I agree with the other reviews--the nose piece is tough to change with these delicate-feeling goggles. They also basically nix peripheral vision with what I guess could be typical glare-reducing sides? Anyway. Over all they seem worth the money to swim laps in a lane. I won't be using these in the lake though bc of the peripheral issue."
4,speedo vanquisher goggles,"silicone does not have the flexibility of rubber , so is less comfortable and harder to adjust the strap length. silicone eye pieces tend to be less comfortable if the strap is even a little too tight ."
4,scratches,"I purchased the Speedo Womens Vanquishers Goggles based on the reviews I read on Amazon and other sites...I was starting a swimming exercise program and really wanted to see where I was going in the pool.The goggles I bought were the pink color, and they were very nice,but more detailed instructions would have been helpful to adjust the straps. If I had to adjust the nose piece I would have returned them because I feared breaking them to make the switch in nose pieces. Luckily I didn't have to change that. I was upset that after my first use and drying the goggles with a soft cloth that they got scratches on the inside. I can still see in the water ,but I'm not happy about the scratches. I think that others should be cautioned not to dry them at all."
2,Unusable in a week!,"My wife ordered this product just 2 weeks ago. She swims thrice a week, and is a serious swimmer. When she first got it, she seemed very happy with it and could swim for long periods without having to adjust them. But now, water gets in constantly. No matter how much the band is adjusted - tightened, loosened - worn at different angles, it just won't protect her eyes. They also seem to get foggy at the end of every lap. She takes care of it as suggested, by rinsing them with clean water at the end of each session. For a $17 product, we don't seem to have gotten our money's worth. I wouldn't buy this pair again.The two stars are for Amazon's packaging and speed of delivery! No stars for these goggles."
3,tight fit,"The gogle keeps the water out but it's so tight on the eyes that I ended up with bruised/swollenarea around my eyes. I don't have the straps tighten at all, it just sucks onto your face.It's suppose to be no-fog, that is mostly true."
1,It was terrible.,"I got this goggles for my grils, 10 & 11 years old. On the second day at swim team practice the strap of one of them was snapped. Second one was also snapped with in two weeks."
2,Nose pieces,"Yes it comes with additional nose pieces. I saw this as an advantage as a small woman (I have even worn children's goggles before). But, the nose pieces are very hard to change. Yet again, this product proves that products are not generally designed for small people."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped for,"I have thick mid-back length hair. It fit in the cap, but did not keep the water away. My hair turned out wet, though not completely soaked.The good side -it stayed on for most of the time I was in the water, which is better than most.I wouldn't purchase this again."
5,Speedo Women's Vanquisher Swim Goggles are the best!,"Loved the color! My daughter does triathalons and she loves wearing these. Would recommend these for any swimmer, novice or pro."
2,Suuuuuuper foggy.,"I got these for my summer swim workouts, and I really wanted to like them. Unfortunately they're so foggy that they're barely worth using. My first couple swims were okay, but now after the first couple laps I can't see a thing. Bummer."
1,Uncomfortable,Although these goggles look great they are uncomfortable. The material pinches your skin and makes them impossible to use. I expected more of Speedo.
2,Not a great product,I was extremely disappointed with the goggles. I wanted a second pair that provided UV protection. They do. BUT... 1) They are uncomfortable. 2) Adjusting them is NOT friendly 3) They fogged on my second use (BIG no-no) 3) It comes with nose bridges of different sizes but it is IMPOSSIBLE to change them 4) They either suck your eyeballs out or let water in if you try to adjust... no happy medium :(Will return product this week. This review is specifically for the Vanquisher product. I have other speedo goggles that work perfectly fine. This one is just not the right one for me.
1,Anti fog coating worthless,I've had 2 pair of these one I bought and another pair my boyfriend bought for me because I forgot to tell him to avoid these. Both fogged up horribly on the 1st swim. I'm not sure what the deal is with these goggles but Speedo needs to change what they are doing with this style.
3,swimming goggles,"These goggles come with 4 different sized nose pieces. I have tried all four and still get some leakage in these goggles. I like the color and they are comfortable, but the leaking is annoying."
4,Speedo Vanquisher,"Both me and my wife love our goggles. However, as the season wore on and it was mildly cooler both of our goggles fogged up. If it never cooled down, I would have rated them higher."
3,Not the greatest,"OK, but not the greatest. Has some occasional leak, but pretty solid most of the time."
5,Speedo swim goggle,"They are so nice. The fit is great, the seal is wonderful. No leaks, just great swimming."
4,vanquish goggles,"Very professional looking goggles, with the sleek mirrored lens. Changable nose clip makes sizing much easier, and silicone straps ease over head so much more nicely than rubber. My only gripe is that being very narrow, the bands are very difficult to adjust, and require a lot of fiddling about, and resulted in my having to use my teeth!Great colour, cool style but Speedo need to look at making those adjustments a little easier please!"
3,Not for small eye sockets,"I have a pair of speedo hydrospex I have had for 8 years that have worked great. But they seem to have shrunk because the bridge now hurts my nose and leaves a dent and the eye seals have become hard and leave bad raccoon eyes after I swim. Despite all this they still work great and they keep the water out but I decided it was time to upgrade.After reading all the great reviews I was excited to try these, especially because they had adjustable bridges. I tried the suction test as soon as I got them and to my disappointment they do not come close to creating a seal. So if you have small eye sockets these may not fit you."
5,great pair of goggles,"these goggles are great. i'm an average swimmer who swims about twice a week. i had a pair of tyr goggles which used to slip off my head slightly and water would get in them if i didn't put it on right. with these, everytime i wear them, water never gets in, they never slip off, AND i don't have to spit in them to make sure it doesn't fog up. they fit comfortably and feel great."
3,Good but not perfect,"I've had these goggles for 2 weeks now - I lap swim about 2-3times a week, and I'm a fair swimmer. Pros are the mirrored lens helps with the sun, and they are definitely more comfortable than my last pair of goggles. They keep the water out for the most part also. Con is that due to the suction of the goggles, they still leave marks on my face which is the reason that I bought new goggles - I have them pretty loose on my face to avoid this, but since there is a suction I guess it's unavoidable. Also, the nose piece is a bit difficult to change as they are fragile goggles."
5,I LOVE vanquishers!!!,"When I needed a new pair of goggles, my friends from swim team recommended that I get Speedo Vanquishers. I assumed that they knew what they were talking about, since the majority of them had been on swim team for years, and WOW did they!!! I LOVE my vanquishers. They let in no water, they don't fall off when I dive in, and I never have to worry about the straps breaking. Now, I won't use any other kind."
2,Clear but painful,"I was excited to get new googles for my lap swimming. I love that these are very clear, so provide excellent visibility; however they feel as if they are bruising my face when I wear them, and the marks they leave last for several hours after my swim. Hoping to find a pair that provides suction to keep the water out without the pain."
2,no leaks but fogs too much,"I swim two or three times a week in a pool and my goggles don't leak and they don't leave the goggle imprint on my face which is nice, but they fog up every lap. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
4,"Misidentified, but nice!","About 15 years ago, I was lucky enough to find a limited edition reproduction of the Soprafino Tarot from about 1835. It came in a handmade paper-wrapped box (made to look antique) and was hand numbered (I believe it was limited to 2000 sets). This deck is a mass produced knock-off, but the art is so nice it's hard to complain! :) Nice to find a set like this so I don't feel guilty shuffling the rare set! Too bad they don't have a better, more accurate description of the set."
1,demolision of the classic tarot deck,"Don't waste your money, the poorly conceived boarder of these cards serve as more of a distraction then an aid, with the classic images polluted by the boarders. Obviously designed for mass production and maximum profit there is nothing classic about these other then the images."
3,"Works, But Uses A NiCad Battery","You may have assumed that the built-in generator was charging a capacitor. Not so. This flashlight uses a Ni-Cad battery (see the photo I uploaded). Yes, I cracked open this flashlight to find out.Now you may ask ""does it matter?"". Maybe, depends on what you are going to use this flashlight for. If you assumed you could put this into storage (like an emergency survival pack) and expect it to work five years from now - you could be very disappointed. NiCad batteries only have so much shelf life - and there's no way to tell the quality of the one that's in this flashlight. It you don't use a NiCad battery regularly, they can die a slow death.So fair warning - only buy this flashlight if you are going to use it regularly.If you are willing to pay a little more, you can get a hand crank flashlight with an ultra capacitor - like the AIT Lightstorm CL1 made my Applied Innovative Technologies - the disadvantage being that it will loose its charge within hours."
4,works fine,"This flashlight works fine, but it feels a little flimsy. If you don't mind how it feels, then don't worry about it. It works perfectly fine."
5,what makes an old man happy,this is the best one yet.try to find the vinyl version though.it has the full lemgth cd enclosed as a bonus.
5,this isn't some kind of metaphor...,"this is entirely in response to the hack review a few (two) down:This may come as a surprise to a few persons who listen to ""underground"" music, but some of us listen to music period without the concern for any sort of ""indie cred"" and, gasp, some of us even listen to music (even Steve Albini's music) and don't even read the reviews on pitchfork! This is definitely, without question, a GOOD, heartfelt (expletive) rock alblum if there exists one. Fear not to buy this record (and if you have a decent record shop nearby, and a turntable, prithee forego the amazon and buy it on vinyl--it comes with the cd anyway), imbibe the pure rock sound and fury, and thank yourself later."
4,Real Musicians create Real Music,"I have another Shellac record that will spin round and round on my player for weeks. This album shows, once again, the superior musicianship of Shellac versus most of the garbage that is released today. Sounds coming from a pure source, no over-the-top effects pedals on bass, guitar and vocals. Shellac proves there is no need for any of that nonsense to get in the way of creating amazing tones and rhythms. The warm, natural overdrive from tubes is much more pleasant to the ear than any digital effect. Definately an album that musicians can appreciate."
4,No 12-minute songs,"The promo sheet proudly proclaims ""no 12-minute songs on this one"", and it's all the better for it. It's back to the angular boogie that we loved so much on At Action Park, and the packaging as always is marvelous. Docked one star for the regrettable ""New Number Order""."
5,Redeemed,"For those who hail At Action Park as one of the best CDs of the 90s, 1000 Hurts delivers more of the emotion-fueled rock that Terraform seemed to only hint at. My only complaint is pure greed - the album is too short. Clocking in at under 40 minutes, the ride is too brief, especially for a fan who was disappointed in Terraform and has been waiting for these tracks for what seems like ages. I don't want to spoil the CD with quotes of lyrics and ""best songs"" but rest assured that is a happy return to the days At Action Park!"
2,huh - the sarcasm won,"Huh, That was the only word that I could muster and not in a stunned way but rather a sigh. I have been a long time fan of albini and have enjoyed many albums from the days of big black, rapeman, on through to shellac. This album, seems consumed by its own sarcasm. It seems like steve may be a bit board and lacking much enthusiasm for ""it"" anymore and it comes through. It left me feeling drained...which is not a feeling I am fond of these days, regardless of his goals. I do not expect people/bands to always put out 10's each release, but I am also not interested in paying to listen to someone else's disinterest. Anyway, I will always give steve a listen down the road, but this album is definitely not for me, and not worth buying."
4,"No the best, but damn close too it.","One of the reviews on this list here gives this album one star? Do you like Steve Albini at all? Why did you bother to review it? Have you heard at Action park? Have you heard Terraform? Ever hear of Big Black? What is the point of challenging everyone else's taste and credibility? This album is excellent, a bit different from Shellac's other releases, but that's the point, different emotions, and feelings go into the production of each album, Steve Albini is one of the only people in music today who makes good choices. Go buy this Record (not CD)."
1,"Unfocused, Poor, Pointless","Shellac and Steve Albini treated this venture as an experiment and that's what you get here. There is no goal to this record other than to ramble and really test your patience.While some people may find in this album as its saving solace and claim to be minimilist, eccentric, or otherwise, you will not listen to this album much. I can find no real use for it other than background music for a drunken party.This was money poorly spent and I should have listened to clips first, though the band won't release clips on their website.Better recommendations might be found in work done by Hermano, Om, Boris, or Cog. Give them a go instead."
3,Not what I expected,"From the reviews in the press I was expecting a mind-bending time-change-laden noise-metal masterpiece. Instead I got what sounds like a recording of three guys in a small club with no audience noodling away on their instruments, or like protest poems spoken over some guys practicing in the background. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole album was recorded in a day...Still, none of that necessarily implies it's a bad album. People who are into lyrics will probably find some interesting stuff here. But it's just a bit too tedious (Mama Gina... oh god make it stop) to keep my attention."
1,I feel embarassed for Steve Albini when I listen to this.,"This is one of the worst, not to mention most downright annoying albums to come out in recent memory. Anyone who claims to like this overrated insult to underground music is just trying to sound cool, and failing miserably. In fact, I'll go out on a limb here and say that anyone who says they like this album hasn't even heard the damn thing, and probably just saw it on a pitchfork list somewhere - and if pitchfork says it's good, it must be good, right? Wrong. This album sucks. It's sad to see people so desperate for indie cred (which, I hate to break it to you, isn't that cool either) that they degrade themselves by publicly admitting they enjoy this album. However, I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys hearing Steve Albini ramble on like a douche, with mediocore music being played in the background. Everyone else, save yourself the trouble and the $10."
4,A bold first novel,"Terrence Cheng writes a bold new novel re-imagining the circumstances surrounding the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. He has boldly (and some would say presumptuously) fictionalized the accounts of the man who famously held up a column of People's Army tanks by merely standing in front of them, and that of Deng Xiaopeng. Both of these stories would be difficult to tell in the hands of a lesser writer, but Cheng pulls it off admirably.The novel isn't so much about the Tiananmen uprising as it is about how the uprising affected the main characters. That said, perhaps the most important scene in the book (holding up the column of tanks) comes too soon in the narrative. After reading that dramatic sequence, everything else that follows falls flat. It's no coincidence that Cheng's narrative loses steam in the beginning of the second half of the book.That said, ""Sons of Heaven"" is an important work and an impressive debut novel."
5,Pretty good,"I thought this was written nicely and was well worth reading. I just randomly picked up this book at the book store and I'm glad I did. Without giving anything away, I liked the ending, and I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,great planner,"i am a dedicated daily planner person. there's something about writing things down and carrying my plans with me. there's lots of space for notes, great health suggestions, and the planner is laid out very nicely for people who really have their weekly/daily schedules planned down to the hour. i'm very pleased and recommend this to people for personal use who need to take frequent random notes throughout the day and need to carry the planner in a purse or small bag."
5,"Wonderful, helpful, insightful, deeply moving, but not for the average Joe","As a professional psychotherapist, I found this book to be a goldmine of information for my practice. However, I have also been told by the two clients I recommended it to, that it was too scholarly and intellectual and the psychological concepts too lofty. And, both of these clients have graduate degrees! Rynearson writes with such raw emotion about his own personal journey in this arena that I found myself crying at one point while reading this book. Personally, I think every professional should be required to read this remarkable book before attempting to help a client recover from the devastation of losing a loved one to murder or suicide."
1,Disappointing.,"Poor arrangements, generally not in the song's original keys, means that there are very few ""good"" selections in this anthology."
5,Dean Martin Songbook,"Excellent Condition, as indicated. Thank you! What more is there to say? I love Dean Martin so I'm sure I will enjoy the songbook."
4,944 Truck Bed Extention,"Used this product once to haul some long boards. This item worked great. Plan on using this product more often. Will be used in uprigth position, to haul long ladders."
4,bed extender,"For the price, this works great. It does move around in the hitch socket a bit, but It's not going anywhere. Most of my loads are just long wood trim, It's perfect for around town, and easier to use than a bolt in rack."
2,idea good/fit bad,"I choose this truck extender hoping to miss some of the problems associated with the other model on amazon. Unfortunately, this model also suffers from some less than excellent production methods. The two pieces that go together to adjust the height of the support have 5/8 inch holes that do not line up, making use of the included pin impossible. I was able to use this item only because I wanted to transport lightweight mouldings, so I used a 1/2 inch pin instead."
4,Extend-A-Truck 944 Truck Bed Extender,"Hitch extender is good for Kayak transport and allows me to secure slippery kayaks to bed, with minimal effort. There are rings on Tee, allow straps and Bunge Cords to effortlessly secure boats to bed. After securing Kayaks in place with Rope and cords, this method of support and tiedown of ends of Kayaks just makes sense. Good product, Well made and painted with good coating for corrosion resistance. Stores easily or hangs from hooks on Garage wall, though it is somewhat weighty. Yo lil' mamma will struggle to move it, but that's why you have one! Also mounts to support cab level or bed rack level loads like ladders. The ladies will like it's slender frame. You yakkers with hitches, should get you one!"
4,Great for light work.,"The Extend-A-Truck works great for long loads that aren't worth getting your trailer out of the shed for. I used it to haul 16' 2x4 and 2x6 on several occasions and 7 sticks of 3"" Std Wt steel pipe between 10' and 12' long on one occasion. All this was done in my crew cab half-ton Sierra with the 5.5' bed without the luxury of a headache rack. There is a lot of flex in this piece since it is fairly thin gage and since receiver hitches were never intended to be used like this. This being considered, with a little care in use, it can be a great asset."
5,Love it!,Fantastic product. Have transported my kayak with ease. Also great for the supply runs to the local home improvement store when you don't want to pay or wait to have it delivered.
4,Worth Every Penny,I purchased the Bed Extender on a Friday and it was waiting on my porch Monday afternoon. I put it in use hauling 16 foot long boards for a decking project the next day. It works as good or better in my opinion than advertised. Paid for itself in the money I'll save on paying for store delivery of my lumber and other large items.
4,A usefull item,"Got this mainly to carry a canoe in my '04 F150 to local lakes here in north jersey. A 15' craft in a 5' bed doesn't seem to work so well, I know, I've tried. Easy to set up and dismantle, and stores in the back seat area of my crewcab. Also good for longer lumber transport. It could be a little thicker steel but it is still easier than trying to fabricate it yourself. Haven't set it up in the vertical position for a load yet, but it looks to be just as good as the flat setting. One note, you will quickly see that tiedown straps are needed to stabilize the rack especialy in the vertical position.That setup I would suggest only light loads, i.e. kayacks or aluminum ladders. Price was the best on the internet."
3,Damaged and reboxed,The box had been opened and retaped with no visible damage to the box but the tube was bent at the end. Had to pound out the dent to insert the parts but it worked well once I fixed it.
5,great item,"I use it to haul a 17 foot canoe in the bed of my truck. Works great, and the best price I found."
4,Works as advertised,"This is an excellent product if you have a short bed and need extra length to haul items such as kayaks,canoes, or lumber. Fast delivery, was here inside of a week."
5,Nice extra space,We have used this several times for taking 2 kayaks out .It has enough space for them both and place for the strap to attach.
2,limited positions,"The Darby bed extender can be mounted in two positions: crossbar at bed height and 4' behind the bumper, or crossbar at roof height with vertical post so close to bumper you can't open the tailgate. Not enough choices, unsatisfactory."
4,Nice addition,"This extender is nice for sure. I use it when I pull out a sheet of plywood and rest it on the extender to create a work table behind my truck. It would be nice if it was a bit longer though. Also, the price is a bit high considering it's just welded steel with a painted finish. Should cost about 50 bucks at most!"
5,A must-read for all Americans.,"This is the book to read if you only read one book this year. It is a must-read for all Americans, and for all the world. Dr. Greer has done a masterful job in bringing together credible and knowledgeable leaders in their various fields, to testify as to the existence of extraterrestrials who have been visiting earth for hundreds, if not thousands of years. The truth of this fact has been kept from the public by a world-wide shadow government for their own purposes, including exploitation of advanced technology obtained from the extraterrestrials. This technology could change the world as we know it, providing free energy, advanced medicine, and ultimately world-wide peace. It is time that this information was disclosed to the public. This is Dr. Greer's mission in writing this book."
5,Outstanding...,"It's about time that insider witnesses came forward and divulged their facts regarding ufo/advanced technology. Now if we only had a Congress with any guts to notify the American public. The fact that we could have a better world with existing technology is truly disheartening and revolting. The Leaders of this world are not leaders. They are bought. As explained by one of the witnesses who stated we have already shot down extraterrestrials...the decisions of a few will impact humanity on a scale far beyond the sociopolitical events here on earth. I am thankful these witnesses have come forth. Maybe some day, news media will go beyond Paris Hilton and Anna Nicole Smith as the only news items worth spending hours on..."
5,"jaw dropping, compelling testimony of factual events.","as i made my way through this book i felt like i was reading something that could get me in trouble. jaw dropping stories and documents really make you think. im uncertain about the credibility of stephen greer but regardless, this book is very entertaining to say the least. glad i read it. certainly gave me a new outlook on things. i also felt a little burdensome after reading. i wanted to tell everyone about this but all i got was ridicule and sheeple looking at me like i was crazy. little do they know..."
5,This is it. All you will get until they decide to show you.,Here is the ONLY book that documents the what and why of actual E.T. contact with modern life on earth.
1,Good info mixed with disinformation,"After reading the entire book, I find the reports about the physical crafts mostly credible. I find the reports about aliens from other worlds and the energy systems these crafts employ firmly rooted in the realm of typical disinformation. To get a handle on what's really happening I recommend reading books from William Lyne."
3,WAP11 Works OK,"Purchased the WAP11 wireless access point to extend and improve my wireless service to the upstairs. Unfortunately, getting the WAP11 to communicate with my current wireless Netgear router was not a simple task. After several attempts and wasted time, I gave up on going wirelessly, so I hard wired to the ethernet port and it works pretty good. Signal has some trouble passing through my brick walls, but it serves its original purpose."
3,Close... but no cigar.,"This book is not a true portrayal of a normal high school atmosphere. Being a high schooler myself, I have never met anyone half as crazy as Ugly Girl or anyone who calls themself Ugly Girl. While the author bruoght up many good points, the characters did not always react as normal/actual people would. The writing styles were well executed and the story as a whole was well written. The plot was exciting and a very suspenseful at times... I think this is a good book for teens to read because it shows how a rumor can get out of control. I liked the novel and I only wish it would relate to real life a little more."
3,not bad,"It starts out when Matt says something like he's going to blow up the school and it gets him in trouble because someone tells the principal what he said. Ursula is the only one who is brave enough to come forward saying he didn't do it. Then, it all leads out to something you didn't really expect and no, it's not that they start going out. You'll be really surprised when you find out who told the principal too. It's a really good book. It tells a lot about two different people and how they're there for each other when no one else is. Ursula also doesn't really believe in herself (she calls herself the ugly girl) and when Matt comes along, he changes that for her. They help each other out. It's a good book for friends to read."
2,Big Mouth and Ugly Girl,"I rated this book 2 stars becuase I havent finished it yet..but I do have a statement thats startiling me.In thesorta middle (when the word gets out and rumors start and Urula is looking for Matts number) anywayz, when shes lookig in the phone book under donaghys....and the person answers the phone and says ""if you are the damned reporters, You have the wrong number""My staement is...They didnt release information on Matts name, so How would that person Know about it? Since I didnt readfar (I'm in the 30s-40s at least) maybe it was the real number...but once I finsish reading it, You can forget this question, But whille aent finsished reading it, someone answer that question, If you can. I will be back next week after I'm done. Oh, other than that, its a good story so far."
2,To know who are your friends!,Ursula Riggs is 16 years old and an outsider but she does not care about it. The other major character is Matt and very popular until he is accused blowing up the school. Every friend breaks up the contact and only Ursula wants to prove his innocence. They become friends very slowly and at the end they even come together.I do not like that you need a very long breath to read through this book. You are waiting that something happens and it does not. It is sometimes very boring. What I like is the growing friendship between Ursula and Matt. At the beginning they do not know each other and later they realize who are their real friends.In addition to that I would say that it is not written in a difficult English and it could be read by people at the age of 14.
4,don't succumb to the hostility of others,"This book offers a glimpse into the lives of two unique high school students. One is a definite outcast, and the other becomes one over the course of the book. Big Mouth and Ugly Girl is an excellent novel because the characters act ""outside the box."" Both of them undergo numerous hardships throughout the course of the book, and they take comfort in unlikely places; each other. This book will teach you to look beneath the surface and discover who they truly are instead of acting like all the rest of the kids at the high school; so ready to point fingers and accuse people at the drop of a hat. I adamantly recommend this book to everyone whether they are in high school or not, they will surely learn something from Big Mouth & Ugly Girl."
3,"Who are your friends, really?","What happens when the most popular boy in school and the least popular girl are thrown together? This is the story of Big Mouth and Ugly Girl. Matt Donaghy gets to know Ursula Riggs when he is falsely accused of a shocking crime. Everyone has doubts about him with the exception of Ursula.Somehow Ursula uses her confidence in Matt to start believing in herself and, this leads us into a touching and unique story where romance blossoms and good triumphs over evil. If you like realistic and pointed characters, real life modern settings, romance that defies the odds and happy endings than this is the book for you."
4,Pretty Good Book,"Hi, I read the book ""Big Mouth and Ugly Girl"". This book was pretty good, but it didn't have loads of excitement in it. This is not a book that would keep you excited throughout the whole story, but it's not so boring that you won't want to finish it.In this book the main character Matt Donaghy is supposely accused for something that he said, but he apparenly never said it. No one in the school knows if his side of the story is true or if he really did say something worth being accused for.Matt loses a lot when no one believes him, but he starts to think that he's gained more than he ever lost.This book takes Matt through thick and thin and back to thick again leading him on an outrageous high school journey.I liked this book pretty well and I think if you will read it you will like it too!"
3,Big Mouth Ugly Girl,This book is written by Joyce Carol Oates and is a fairly interesting book. I would give it a three out of five because some parts seem to drag on forever and others seem like they will never reveal the rest. It is about a fictional character named Ursula Riggs and her life. Ursula was the star of her school's basketball team and was not usually getting in trouble. When a boy in her school gets accused by a couple of kids of planning on blowing up the school and massacring a couple hundred people. But sure enough Ursula is at the right place at the right time to tell the police and a lot of other authorities that he was joking around with his friends when he said that. After Ursula saves him from being expelled they become good friends and life returns to normal.
4,Child Development,"As far as textbooks go this is a pretty good one. I really like the inside cover, which lays out a lot of the stages that children go through, as well as different theorists & their theories. It is a great place to turn to when you are stuck trying to figure out an answer. The book is very well laid out & fairly easy to understand. The only thing I don't like about this book is that is skims over so many things. I really feel that if you don't know a lot of background psychology information a lot of the text is going to go over your head."
1,Terrible,"I received my book in the mail about 2 weeks ago, I recently opened it and found that the first chapter was not even connected to the book (the pages where just set in there) and several pages throughout the book are actually missing. I'm not happy at all."
4,Nice for my big behind,"I am an occasional drummer for my church and I have to say this is the nicest throne for which I have ever had the pleasure of resting my large rear.I also purchased the backrest for it, which helps immensely when getting tired after sitting through a church service on it. The backrest does not like to stay in place and I have to constantly tighten it. This could be solved by a set screw hole or something of the like.My only wish is that it could adjust a little lower since I am a short drummer and have my kit adjusted to my height. If this throne could go about 2"" lower, my legs would not feel like they are going to sleep during longer periods of sitting on it.Otherwise, thanks for a great product."
3,this could have been at least 4 stars,I have read about 4 of Webb Garison's Civil War books and though all have been god except for Friendly Fire they are all basically the same. This is a good book and yes it might have 1 or 2 stories the other books didn't but you can only read the same story in the same format som many times and Garrison repackaged these stories to death. He is a good author though and I do recomend reading most of his books but be warned that they are very similar
3,Love's Insecticide is NOT DDT,"This mini-album is well worth the price for the wry ""Love's Insecticide"" and the doric, quiet, and heartbreaking ""Please Have Everything."" Since you cannot buy Scrawl's ""He's Drunk"" or ""Plus, Also, Too,"" this is a good direction for your otherwise worthless cash. Just because. Because I said so. Because consumerism's only reward is manifesting spiritual want. Because RiotGrrl forgot its history. Because wretched March weather goes on FOREVER in central Ohio. Because memories of flirting with the girl with freckles at the smoky bar would fill your eyes with tears of regret, too, if you had them. Damn."
2,waste of your money,very loose fit. found it very annoying. Its speaker cuts are not big enough so it covers up the speaker and lowers volume.
1,Nice when new - cheap,"This lasted about 3 months b4 the clip broke. Looking at it made me wonder how it lasted that long. The leather is of excellent quality, but quality failed to make it to the rest of the product. I will avoid this brand for all future phones."
2,Did not fit the phone,"I really wasn't happy with the fit of this product on my Env. Every time I opened the phone, the snap would come undone and the bottom part that covers the key board would fall off.I don't feel that this is what I would want to use (and I don't) to protect my phone.Spend a little more and get one that actually fits."
2,Cell Phone Case,I really liked it at first but then it started to stretch and is loose. Also the plastic sticks to the phone and it makes the phone hard to remove from the case.
2,Bad product!!,this case is horrible..first my clip broke off after 2 and half month of use and the phone flips open if u do a little jogging around...lastly it doesnt feel comfortable when opening the lg envy for texting and it makes the phone look bulky.
4,The Semi-Pros,For someone interested in football this is a great read. It combines a little romance with blow by blow details of playing the great game of football. An insightful melodrama applied to the game as it's most basic level.
4,"Not as good as ""Beauty for Ashes"" but solid","Nothing earth shattering here, but still a great album from Crystal. I thought ""Beauty for Ashes"" was terrific, and she follows the same sound and style here"
5,Absolute Perfection,"This is a breathtaking CD. I am not a long-time Crystal Lewis fan -- in fact, this is the only Crystal Lewis disc I own. But this disc has made a life-long fan of me.Crystal's voice rings with a God-given strength that comes across clear as -- you guessed it -- Crystal. What makes the songs every more impactful is that most are written by Crystal or her husband (and the title track by her Brother-in-Law). This is a family affair -- a family that is tracking with YHWH, a personal God with whom they are so obviously in fellowship.Thanks to Crystal & Co. for the blessings!!! Christ is using you in some amazing ways!"
4,Golden,"The song ""Gold"" is worth the price. I have the original version of this song, but you can't beat the way Crystal sings this song. It's unreal. I'm not a fan of vocal singing just for the sake of ""check out my pipes"", but this song is simpy mindblowing. I think ""Beauty for Ashes"" is a better all-around disc, but this one is worthy, too."
3,Overhyped media production glitz,"I know that popular christian music artists must suffer the line of struggling with humility between worshiping God and their own media image, but it seems that on this CD Crystal Lewis tries to talk the talk, but doesn't convincingly walk the walk on this cd. I was moved by the lyrics and content on ""Beauty for Ashes"", but on this album, even on the third listen for Gold, all that seemed to come across was a lot of commercialism and media production. Granted there were some good songs and Crystal Lewis does have a powerful voice."
2,Not a fan of Crystal Lewis,"This album has some good songs on it, but am I the only person who can't stand her voice? Plus I don't understand the hype about Kirk Franklin who sings on Lean on Me. Actually he doesn't sing he talks. I guess I will never understand his popularity."
1,What happened to Crystal Lewis?,"This is not the WORST Crystal Lewis CD EVER MADE! I have been a fan of Crystal Lewis since 1992, and one of my first CDs was Crystal's 1987 recording ""Beyond The Charade"" (which is ultimately her best). My dad has let me borrow all of her cassettes. I checked this CD out at my public library and I thought it was terrible. If you want good Crystal Lewis, buy ""Beyond The Charade"" (good luck trying to find it) or her new CD+DVD release ""More"" which features some classic and brand-spanking new Crystal Lewis. Just stay away from this terrible CD!"
2,Not exactly what I had hoped...,Good quality as far as stitching and fabric however where the garters attach rubbed me raw and it wasn't as long as I had needed...
4,yummy grahams with no HFCS or trans fats,"These are a delicious snack, and you can get for much cheaper on Amazon than buying by the box at retail in the ""special grocer's"". The only drawback is that Annie has not decided to use a whole grain graham flour. I am still looking for a whole grain graham cracker, and until then, these will cure my craving."
1,AWFUL!,"The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag is how thin the cookies were. Second was the scent, I made a verbal note that they smelled weird.Then I tasted one and thought maybe this taste is because I brushed my teeth. ... NOPE! They are just awful.I even got a lady at my work to try them and the first thing she said was ""they taste like cardboard!"" She told me I should take them back to the store for a refund. I hate wasting anything so I have resulted to chasing the cookies with a breakfast shake."
3,Of the times,"Fine example of what passed for the modern folk surge of the era. The guitar is excellent as to be expected but the vocals, though striking, sound over stylized now. But recommended for a pleasant listen."
1,low bid sucker bait,"This outfit prices this item at 20 bucks lower than others, then adds 20 bucks to the shipping cost. Beware of outfits that do business like this. I would not trade with them at all."
2,Prefer to buy in local store or Shiseido's website only,"I bought this cream in a local store before and like it. But for this one, the container is different from the one I bought before, the botton part is very loose and can be taken apart very easily. I don't feel the cream as the same as the one I bought before. In a summary, it's suspicious to me. I will just buy it in local store or Shiseido's website."
2,Weakest of the Herbie Mann Live Recordings,"Let me preface this review by stating from the beginning, I am a huge fan of Herbie Mann's music. I've been listening to him since 1974, soon after I began learning to play the flute.Like many jazz musicians, Herbie Mann was able to convey the energy/vibe from the crowd, back to the audience. This is especially evident in the second of the Live at Newport recordings, ""Standing Ovation."" Listen to the encore of ""Comin' Home Baby"" and you'll hear what I mean. On ""New Mann at Newport"" Herbie's solos sound just a bit forced and it seems to me that there's a certain cohesiveness that's lacking. The title also seems ironic since the playing seems to be trying to recapture the magic of the previous Newport recordings.Herbie Mann recorded a genuinely satisfying wealth of music to listen to. If you're looking to get started, I suggest you check out my list here on Amazon."
5,Excellent CD,Keni Thomas sings from the heart. Great music that makes you think. You can tell that his is very proud of his country and the people who served with him.
5,Great Tribute!!,"I just recently purchased this CD and I can't stop listening to it. It's just so great! The lyrics are powerful and heartfelt. This is a powerful tribute to all the heroes that have died for the red, white, and blue. God Bless America!"
2,Average - Good Pictures,I could not find any secrets from this book. Since digital is now the new photgraphy this book is totally film. Even so it was not too helpful.
5,It is pretty good,This is kind of a fancy m&m with a vanila sugar coating. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it as 8. Of course your paying $8 a pound and not the $40 a pound they get for the best. I would not hesitate to put it out for any social event.
4,Peepee Teepee,I am giving it to my daughter who is due in December with a baby boy so I cannot comment yet on how she liked it.
1,RUDE RUDE LOUSY SELLER. BUY FROM SOMEONE ELSE,"The item is OVERPRICED and NOT worth the extra this seller charges. The seller is rude, and the so called laundry bag is MICROSCOPIC. The description is misleading and there are much cheaper items that are made better. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS SELLER. I was counting on the delivery promise date- then the seller claims that HE KNEW WHEN I RECEIVED IT- I have the documentation which states otherwise. Take your money and buy from another seller. The item is not worth it."
3,"Good for a Newborn Boy, but...","This little teepee worked well for my newborn boy, but now that he is older, the teepee will not -ahem- stay on. Not only does it fall off when he wiggles around on the changing pad, but his bladder is much bigger, so the ""knock-off"" power is much greater. :) Of course, the humor factor is priceless when you see the teepee shot into the air."
1,unnecessary,"Unless your baby sits completely still and has no interest at all in moving his legs, don't waste your money because it falls off constantly. If you'll notice in the picture, the hands are holding the baby's legs. That's why."
1,Turned out to be a waste of money,"An adorable idea, seemingly ingenious, but in the end horribly executed and a waste of money. They make for a couple of cute pictures when your newborn is very small and still in the beginning, but as soon as they can move the product becomes more of a hassle than a help. We found placing a burp cloth/cloth diaper over top of them during changes worked just as well if not better. I honestly wish I had saved the money for something far more useful."
2,Not needed!,This is once again a product that is not needed at all. I bought it before my son was born and guess what...didn't use it. The washcloth is much better alternative. It actually stays in place.
2,Novelty Only...,"They are a great shower gift sure to get a lot of ""oo-o-ooh""s and ""a-a-a-awe""s... but they fall off of baby the second he moves."
5,Awesome,I play it over and over all day at my desk on my second monitor while I work!The picture is clear and stunning.
5,Been watching this one for 2 days..,"I have had this running for 2 days now on a 60"" Plasma and I love it. The colors and contrasts in these waterfalls is breathtaking. One of the one star reviews said that they wanted to see some other waterfalls, which is fine, but that's no reason to put this one down. They use a lot of panoramas in the afternoon when the light is just right. It will calm your nerves."
5,Great !,"Very peacefull videos, with natural sounds perfect for to read some books. Great naturall sounds with great HD definitions, beatifull waterfalls."
3,Six of the Twelve Falls are okay,"Six of the Twelve Waterfalls are okay.If my copy of this DVD were lost or destroyed, I would NOT purchase again."
3,"Beautiful video, but poor sound unfortunately","I own quite a few of these DVD's and I like to watch them as a substitute for actually being in the great outdoors at times when I can't be there. Many of them are so good they make you feel as if you're really there. This DVD has some unbelievably beautiful video of some of the world's most majestic waterfalls. Unfortunately the videographers, in most cases, were unable to capture the sound of the waterfalls. It's a shame. Because of this I don't want to watch this DVD. I think what happened is that they were getting zoomed in shots from a great distance from most of the falls and recorded the sound at the camera location. The video, however looks like you are right next to the falls. It needs to sound like you're right next to the falls to be realistic. If I were Living Landscapes, I would get down at the base of these falls, record the sound and rework this DVD."
5,(review was extracted from letter to publisher),I plan to use this excellent London Underground map as a gift..
1,"Old, maps need to be current",This map is outdated. Several lines have been extended. I noted that when going out to Greenwich and finding the Docklands Light Rail line had been extended and I didn't need to walk from the end of the line.Freebee maps are available at all tube stations and on the web.
3,Mixed Feelings,"I read this book and I had alot of mixed feelings about it.Castle Wrath was really disappointing. It had me curious until the end and I almost thought about selling the book back I was so angry. But I decided to read on.Running with Stone Ponies is what saved me the time to through the book aside. I thought that was a good story and it really had me on edge. I think if there was a director reading this I think he or she should make a movie out of it. It would really be good.Elsewhen I really couldn't get into it. I half went off into another world while reading this. I don't know if thats possible or either I'm just weird. But I think it could've been better.We Recruit I can see this as a movie as well. Unlike Running with Stone Ponies where the situation was serious, this one was more comical. But it was good.Overall it was up and down emotions of disappointment, sadness, unimportant, to just plain funny. So I'm not really sure how to rate this one."
5,Fabulous Motown,"This is a great album - a good selection of classic Motown songs and artists and remixed in such a way that only enhances them, rather than with so many other remixes, distorts them unnecessarily. Would recommend to any Motown fan!"
4,Durabull as Durable!!,"Have had this tool box for many years. Just like the name, the toolbox is very durable and holds up to quite a bit."
3,"White Willow - Ok, But They Would Do Much Better","Fans of this band tend to differ when it comes to how much they like their early as opposed to late material. For me White Willow has gotten better with every release as they have moved somewhat away from their early more folk-prog roots. For others the opposite is true. Of the three White Willow albums that I own ""Sacrament"" is my least favorite. It is a very moody, mellow album with lots of dynamic shifts which lean in the symphonic folk progressive rock direction. The music is all good and the female vocals of Sylvia Erichsen fit in perfectly with overall feel of the pieces. Yet for me this is still an album of a band in transition that had not really found the right direction in where they wanted to go at this point. Opinions are going to vary a lot on this and the band's first two albums, but for me it is just average and the band would do much better later on. I am sure there are a lot of White Willow fans who have the exact opposite opinion."
2,Hmmmm.,"I never slam music, because it is open for interpretation. Thought I would like because I love progressive music like Porcupine Tree, Ozric Tentacles, Lana Lane, Can, etc. Just not my cup of tea."
5,Vintage Isley,"Vintage Isley brothers. They give you the fast phase, then smooth it out so very nicely in the middle and at the end of the CD. In my opinion this should have been nominated for a Grammy."
4,NEW GENERATION ART,"Another fine album by the mighty isleys. Their first for the 90s.The overall aura is somewhat different from the other albums,Each album is like a new frontier, ready to be explored!!.Not the ultimate isley album,but nonetheless, we got some gems here,give an ear to ""searching for a miracle"",""sensitive lover"",""bedroom eyes"",""whatever turns you on"" and ""lost in your love"" are true ballards in every sense. We got some uptempo ones too, like ""morning love"", ""red hot"", and ""kooling out"". Socially concious songs like ""no axe to grind"" and ""get my liks in"",are worth some attention. Weighing in at 14 songs total, no matter your musical taste, there is going to be a few here that's going to get your love!!. I suggest this piece of art to diehard isley fans. For the questioning person of this generation,it's worth a keen listen!!!."
1,what carbide?,This holesaw was a mistake in the ad it didn't have carbide teeth as advertised other than being the wrong thing it is OK
4,Commit to Memory,"This is a story that kept me on the edge of my seat with anticipation. The back cover basically tells the reader about Aisha's fate--I just strapped my seatbelt for the ride. Aisha's courageous fight for survial when all of the odds were against her was empowering. Although a lot of knowledge was dropped, this was an easy read and in one word - compelling. The lifestyle Aisha lead didn't equal her consequences. These events could happen to anyone regardless of religious stature. The safety tips for women the author offered are something we should all commit to memory."
2,watery,this was a book written by a man so it lacks passion. there is no erotica. it tells a simple story about an African girl and her family.
1,Knife Sharpener,DONT buy this Sharpener!!! I got this sharpener for Christmas along with a buck knife. I attempted to sharpen the knife and scratched the knife really bad! Keep looking!
3,big wave,"I got a 7"" from these fine folks back in the early 90's and I remeber it being pretty good. This though is'nt as good as it could be though. Indierock girl vocals kinda Velocity girl kinda jangle jangle. My wife digs this CD though, maybe i should give it another spin."
1,item did not work on ipod touch!,siad item would charge an ipod touch in car...did not work ..got message saying ipod did not support this product.
5,"Brilliant, incisive, insider's view","You wouldn't expect this topic to yield a ""breezy read"" but this overview of Strauss, the Straussians and the ""philosophy"" behind the neo-conservative position is engaging, thorough, and critical without being didactic or overly abstract. Norton provides the clearest definitions I've seen of neo-conservatism's various positions and their similarities to and differences from conventional conservatism and neo-liberalism. Essential reading for anyone seeking an understanding of the sinister and deeply misguided minds behind the Bush regime. David Heintz, professor in Media Studies."
3,Is book about Strauss or attacking Bush's War on Terror?,"Perhaps Anne Norton really is an expert on Leo Strauss. She writes well and throws out a lot of names. But half way through the book, the reader realizes that her interest in Strauss is secondary to her interest in, and dislike of, the Bush War on Terror. By the end, it is apparent that Ms. Norton feels that the War on Terror is being fought by the United States on behalf of Israel.If you share her conviction that the Neo-conservatives, descended from Strauss, have hijacked U.S. foreign policy on behalf of Israel, read the book. It is well written and makes the conspiracy case about as well as possible. If you just want to learn more about Strauss, try a different book."
1,The title is misleading!,"Obviously this DVD is on ""another level.""I feel that the sole purpose in creating this DVD was to provide an outlet for the photographer's exhibitionism and various fetishes, which is okay for a soft porn flick in adult section. What is not okay is to present this DVD as a photography manual.The only type of photographer that can benefit from this is an extreme beginner with no imagination, one who does not know that he can use a lamp, candle or anything else that shines as a light source. The narration is very mediocre.The value I got out of the purchase of this title came in the second chapter. I had to laugh vigorously when I imagined myself and my photography colleagues dressed in the see-through fishnet overall outfit the photographer was wearing.No disrespect to the photographer and her lifestyle, but I feel I was tricked into buying this DVD by its title."
4,An especially useful tool,"Anyone who's just getting started with photographing nudes or semi-nudes in the studio would find this video a useful reference. Each of the ten segments explores a photographic idea such as backlighting, shadows, costumes or candlelight photography that can be used as a basis for a singel photo session ... or combined if one has the time available. Obviously it would be impossible to fully explore all the possibilities of any one of the exercises in the context of such a video ... but that's the point. Each segment in the sequence provides a jumping off point for the photographer. It is intended to stimulate experimentation rather than to map out all the possibilities.If one has many years of experience in the studio, perhaps this is not the most useful video but, for anyone in the early stages of their career, I believe its a good investment and worth reviewing periodically as a reminder that there are any number of techniques that one can use to achieve engaging results."
4,Good video if you're looking to increase your creativity,"If you're looking for a photography ""how-to"" video (or some kind of ""Playboy"" style video), you'll likely be disappointed with this DVD. HOWEVER...if you're an artistic photographer looking for help with the creative side of your work - I think you will find it quite useful.It starts a little slowly, but quickly takes off after just a few minutes! I got a few direct ideas from it, but what was most valuable to me was help with ""thinking outside the box"" more. I felt that this video was more ""inspirational"" than ""educational"" - which is really the more difficult material to find (IMHO). Technique without creativity can only take you so far!"
4,A Sensual Approach,"This film explores creative experiments in photography, lighting, and costuming that you can do with models/amateur models, or that you might try with your wife or girlfriend. I found that the film's narration was informative without being too technical, and the photographer explained what she was doing to the model she was working with, and us the viewing audience. The film moves at a relaxed pace, to display the workings of a real time photo shoot in each experiment presented. I found that one of the most valuable lessons shown in this film was how a relaxed and open communication with the model, can really bring out her sensuality. Experiments is a sensual approach to photography."
1,"1 star, because 0 isn't an option","A fully regrettable purchase. Amateur in every respect. I wish it were a book, then I could rip the pages out and put them to use, one at a time... Don't waste your money."
2,A Slow Moving Story,"I picked this book up at the library recently and I have to say that although the storyline is a good one, I found the telling of Bo's tale to be much too drawn out.The story begins with a car accident and Bo, a bi-racial child, is dangling upside down in his mother's car. His mother Jenny has been killed and Bo is now an orphan. From here the story continues with both sets of grandparents fighting for custody of Bo. The white grandparents only want Bo when they come to the realization that there may be some money involved. The story of the whole custody battle was slow moving and really not developed enough.I enjoyed parts of the book but really felt it could have been a little less confusing in its depiction. It was somewhat disjointed and the characters never became real to me."
4,"Quite a ""Mood-Setter""","The author of MAKE BELIEVE certainly knows how to create a mood. She has a way of becoming the character. I could tell when she wrote through the eyes of the child, Bo. A couple of my favorite lines while reading were:Laughter was evidence of a person's value...Who needs words when you can say everything you need to say with your eyes?All images had stories to tell, causes to explain.The story will make you smile in some parts as you reminisce about being a child all over again. There are moods of alarm during a few sudden and unexpected events. A few days after completing the book the story made me wonder what is real and what is not (make believe). The reviews on this book were amazing which caught my eye. I am truly glad I read it. You won't feel left out when you're done. It is a worthwhile book!"
3,tragic and atmospheric,"This book both drew me in with its beauty and realistic portrayal of 3-year-old Bo's thoughts and repelled me with its unstoppable sense of tragedy. About responsibility and piousness as well as familial love, Scott also deals admirably with the tricky subject of interracial relationships. Bo's father dies before he is born, so he is left in the care of his still teen-aged mother (who has been disowned by her own family for falling in love with Kanon, who is African-American and Bo's father) and his father's loving parents. When his mother, Jenny, dies, a custody battle ensues between the grandparents and the situation escalates into one which is dangerous for everyone. I recommend this book due to the poetry of Scott's writing, and also the beautiful fragmentary style with which she switches between characters in the past and present."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"The drummer was described as being a 'Master Drummer."" I was expecting him to be at the same skill levels of Ron Tutt and Jim Keltner inThe Sheffield Track Record Drum Record. They play drums like musical instruments. I wanted to hear a skilled drummer on different types of drums. The drummer in Poems Of Thunder had the different drums but played them to where it sounded like a bunch of obnoxious noise. Being Chinese, it may be a cultural thing, but not the type of thing I would wish to buy again."
4,Poems of Blunder.,"I eat a lot of wicker furniture and unprocessed wheat so mainly I use this albumn to stimulate my colon. Traditionally I hug my boombox and let the thumping beats of Duck's Quarrel loosen things up for me. I use the bathtub for this because I caught my wife cheating on me and as near as I can see this is the best way to get back at her (I blame the dog).Furthermore, having engaged this album with the sense of touch rather than sound I feel I have a more intimate relationship with it and following that, with Yim Hok-Man. I can't explain with words how I feel about it but if I may...bum bum bum BUMBUM BUBUM Shugga dugga dugga dugga dugga dugga.For those of you who haven't enjoyed the album I'll translate: ""The fragrance of a lily flows until the lily's end, it does its duty until the lily passes. So must we pass the fragrance, the kindness and generosity, until we pass. Curses on the white man who spreads yellow fever, may he be kept in a prison of ice as pallid as his face."""
2,plain collection of data,"I bought this book not realizing that is nothing more that two sheets for each element, collecting useful, but quite easily found data. Do not expect any written text. In the internet era, just look at the NIST site, I hardly see the need of such compilation."
4,Great Light but...,"The light from the bulb is excellent, the warm light feels like day light, while the Verilux daylight really feels too strong on the blue spectrum to me, at least I don't see the same color under the sum light.The Panasonic bulb is great except it takes a while to reach full brightness(like 20 sec. or so). and it starts very dim. The 15w looks like a 20w. incandlescent for the first 5 sec. if you have not turned on the light for a while(10 minutes). which might annoy some people. Yet I don't have problem with other bulb flourscent light with such a long delay such as Verilux."
5,Awesome,"Some people said that since it has slight nudity, it's bad. one thing to say: READ THE REVEIWS! It doesn't really cover how to draw basics, but it's great for an experienced artist."
2,Neutral,"Well, don't expect too much from this book. I don't really reccommend this book. The first part has nudity all over the place. Really. Even in other parts of the books which teaches you how to draw things OTHER than body parts, it also includes nudity. I have many examples, but only 2 will be said: When they teach to draw the neck and water drops/sweat. So if you want to draw females, head over to pretty gals (great book) this one does not teach you to draw female characters but they teach you how to draw naked girls. Only a small part of it doesnt, and mostly its ""learn from the pros"" which the author of this book did not draw the images in their, but got from other artists. So, as a final saying, do not buy this book, dont waste your time and money."
2,How to draw manga or females in sexual positions?,Thinking this book would make drawing the female form easier in the manga style might not be the best motivation for buying this book. The book is almost completely based on sexual positions you may want to draw in and in my opinion isn't what drawing the female figure should be about. Buy this if your not interested in drawing anything but dirty pictures!
5,Great for learning figures and proportions,"This book is excellent for learning to draw to female figures for manga that isn't highly stylistic. It does assume that the reader knows basic rules for drawing faces and other parts, what equipment is used, and has access to tools commonly found only in Japan (like screentones). There were a few publishing errors made when flipping the book over to read left to right, but they are minor and easily caught. Overall, this is a great book for the developing manga artist who already has some practice. I hope the book on drawing young boys is as helpful (if I can ever find it)."
1,Awful at best,"This book did not help me at all. Breasts, buttocks, crotch, and tastless panty shots took up the majority of the book, though I found a few helpful hints. I guess guess the ""techniques for drawing female characters"" was different from my expectations. The male character book wasn't anything like this."
1,Poor Illustrations,"As other reviewers noted the book is abound with upper body nudity and some rather indecent panty shots (Which are made all the more hilarious by little warnings ""Be careful not to draw the crotch in too much detail. Otherwise the affect is obscene"" they should have told the illustrators that. Despite pages on n the jiggling of the breast drawing the female face and portraying different female characters is almost non-existent. Add into that the poor illustrations and the affect is a pure waste of money. The illustrations were rather crude and unrefined and not something you want to aspire to.If you really want to draw female characters check out Volume 2 of ""more How to Draw Manga"" by go office. Although, the title is officially penning characters there's a lot about female body types and the art is consistently top notch. It also briefly talks about women's eyes, a very important feature of any manga character.Just save your money and don't bother with this title."
