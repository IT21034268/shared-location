1,Impossible to install,"None of the hardware was included, nor are there any holes in the round part at the bottom through with to drill screws. What am I supposed to use, super glue?"
1,worthless,"They work like a slinky....which means you end up annoyed playing with it and never get to use it because it tangles, snaps back and clogs...oh and water never gets to come out where you want it..."
1,Please send the complete set,"I suppose I would get two books(volumn 1, volumn 2) because I purchased Ultrasound Physics and Instrumentation, 4th Edition 2-Vol Set.But I just got only one book(volumn 2). I hope the seller send the other one(volumn 1) ASAP."
1,Failed the test with this book,"Yupp, I failed it. Too much detailed information that confuses the heck out of you. The actual test has a lot of simple vocabulary that this book was not able to convey to you. It is a good book if you just want to read something (on your spare time, which I do not have) for your C.E's. I trusted this thing 100% that it will deliver good results but wrong! Do not trust this book if you are taking your SPI, read and review something else, because 3 of us that have this book all failed and I told others to review something else before taking their exams. Good Luck everyone! Now, I'm back to square 1. I am so mad of myself for trusting this book. I saw that someone wants to use it for bonfire, let me know, I want to join in....."
5,Great Purchase,I needed this book for the Physics of Ultrasound class for my ultrasound program. I got it much cheaper here than at the school's bookstore (which I am boycotting for dismal customer service). I had terrific service here though; the book arrived on time and in pristine condition. Thank you!
2,gnomes,I wish I'd paid more attention to this book before ordering. I thought it would be in story form and not just informative. It wasn't what I wanted at all.
2,Cute little thing.,"This itsy bitsy work is great for the children. Gave three out to my GKids. For adults you might want Ms. Virtue's Healing book with Fairies. There is a World Guide if you want a vast historical review of what distant past generations have to say about nature people. If You Could Only See .. A Gnome's Story is a more modern, direct-channel of the Gnomes for those who want to learn how to see, sense, hear and feel the wee folk. If you want light reading, the Christmas book here fits in a stocking, looks real Christmasy and is a very simply written bookette that the kids will enjoy for their first introduction to Gnomes. Good for 6 - 12 years old, I would guess. Consider it.Windy"
5,Gnomes make me Happy,Book arrived in excellent(new) condition in a most timely manner-2 days if I remember correctly. I'm quite impressed.
5,"Great Video, Must See",I am an Airman. I lost my brother-in-law in Iraq. We miss him dearly. This video gives viewers a glimpse of the pain from those left behind.
3,Sure cure for mania,"Keep your tissues handy if you watch this one! It's a real tear-jerker. There can't ever be ""too much tribute"" to our brave military people, and this DVD is obviously done with the utmost respect for ""those who gave all."" The only draw back is that it wasn't more professionally produced and edited. It strikes you as ""amateurish"" from the start, but full of touching scenes nonetheless.This DVD is sort of a tribute / documentary of Area 60 of Arlington National Cemetery. It shows family, friends and other people affected by the death of their loved ones. It also shows part of a military burial that most people never see (covering the grave, etc.)"
2,HP Media Center,"Although the HP Media Center works well, I've found that structurally the unit is not built very well. After four months of use the start button broke and I haven't been able to get HP to send me a new one. I even shipped them the broken piece and asked for a replacement and they refused. I now operate my new computer with the front face panel removed so that I can push the on/off switch. A lot of frustration in dealing with there customer service over a 50 cent piece."
2,"This monster roars, louder than an airplane.","Trust me, do NOT buy this PC. I bought one 2 weeks agoand am very disappointed. I even equipped it with a 3ms,19"" LCD and 5.1 speakers. I want crash it now.The noise from the fan is very loud. Especially when a DVDis in the DVD-ROM, it become an airplane and you arebeside that monster. Put it simple: you can NOT enjoyany thing from the ""media centre"" of this PC.If you just want a PC, don't waist your moneyfor the useless ""media centre"" package. If you wantto use the ""media centre"" function, you should go fora quieter one. Now, I can't return it because it's not a""defect"" or I pay 15% restock fee.Another problem of this PC: many DVD data or movies burnedby other PCs can not read by this PC's DVD-ROM or DVD-RW,while other PCs can read them without any problem.Also, HP installed 100s junk and monitoring services in thesystem and make it extremely slow. Visible applications canbe removed easily, but invisible services is hard to identifyand remove."
2,Fatal Errors,"I have owned this computer since November. In more than 20 years of computer usage, I have never, ever, ever had a system with more problems. I have experienced all of the problems that Jessica mentioned, but because I need to review television programs for a living, these problems have cost me lots of time and some money. I'm averaging 2 fatal problems weekly and have had to go out and purchase a much more reliable Tivo to handle the recording functions. I can agree that when the system does work, it is wonderful but the frequency of problems far outweighs everything else."
1,I GOT A LEMON,"I HAVE THIS COMPUTER, IT IS 8 MTS. OLD. A NEW MOTHERBOARD AND A NEW HARD DRIVE HAS BEEN PUT IN. A TECH COULD NOT DO THIS AND IT HAD TO BE SENT TO CA, TWICE. INCONVENENT,, PLUS THE FACT EVETY THING ON IT WAS OFF AND I HAD TO REFORMAT IT. THE STORE I BOUGHT IT FROM HAD PUT THE THINGS I WANTED ON IT( I PAID FOR THAT MYSELF) I HAVE HAD PEOPLE IN TO REDO STUFF ON IT AT MY EXPENSE. I WILL NOT BUY ANYTHING FRUM HP AGAIN. THE THING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE SINCE IT WAS UNDER WARRENTY, IS REPLACE WITH EVERYTHING INSTALLED LIKE IT WAS WHEN I BOUGHT IT"
1,Broke the hi E string in a matter of minutes,"I figured I would try and see how these strings are, and I put them in, stretched them, then tightened them, and stretched them again before final tuning. I bent it up 1 note higher, and broke it without even getting warmed up. Not something I would buy again."
5,Great Wacky Packages Binder,This three ring binder is a big hit with my 10 year old daughter and her friends. This is a great item for anyone who likes Wacky Packages
5,Pandora Likes It,The Genome Music Project (Pandora) classifies music by hundreds of attributes. Apparently Inner Circle tracks share a number of attributes in common with with some of the best reggae music in the world. My IC station keeps me busy hitting the thumbs up button. This album appears often in the playlist. Jah Music. Praise God.
3,thisbookwasgood,"In a future world consumed in destruction and poerty, Jake Lawrence risks his life for the people he loves. As an assignment for school, Jke must find the relusive storyteller J. Adam and interview him. However things start to quickly get mysterious and challenging. Jake must take are of his plague stricken brother Evan, and keep his friend Mellie from her evil father. As Jake finds himselfgetting in over his head, all he can do is ask more questions. Will he find J. Adam? Can he find a cure for his brother? And can he keep himself from being killed? Jake must not give up, unless he wants kicked out of school. Evan's Voice is filled with science fiction, adventure, and mystery, and is a wonderful book."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,PLEASE BUY THIS BOOK!!! it is really really good! you will never guess the ending! its soooooooooo awesomely excellent!
2,"Classic Fairy Tales, Vol. 1-3","Was not what I expected and was very disappointed. Maybe my fault, maybe I didn't read the product information very well. The DVD show is not like moving mini stories. Its more like a still shot of a picture from a book and then a long written page that is then spoken. Not for small children.I would say more for older children if they will sit down long enough to listen. I did get my 7 year old granddaughter to sit (with me) to listen to one of the stories. Not written with young children ease of understanding I believe the stories are original writings and do not use the everyday language of today. She did seem to enjoy somewhat but was constantly having to ask what so many of the words meant. I guess I should give it 3 stars for giving her this type of exposure but still all in all..."
2,Not Easy to Read,"There is a lot of information in this encyclopedia, but it is not easy to read. If you need an immediate answer at a glance it is helpful but I think it is not fluent in language and idea."
1,Don't waste your money!! Doesn't work with Windows 7!!,"This book was a great buy ten years ago -- easily worth 5 stars --because it really is encyclopedic. But the really valuable part of itis the CD-ROM, that has ""complete text and fantastic searchcapabilities,"" as one reviewer said. Unfortunately, the CD-ROMdoesn't work with Windows 7, so it's completely worthless. The bookitself is very hard to navigate, but if you really want it, then get aused copy for a couple of dollars. Don't waste your money on a newcopy."
3,How many more errors are there?,"This volume is very handsome--beautifully typeset. And the illustrations are nicely done, too. However, the very first person I looked up, Charles A. Lindbergh, revealed an error. At the bottom of the first column on page 729, the year for CAL's flight is given as 1925, not 1927 as it should be. (It is correctly noted on page 428.) Needless to say, finding such a significant error almost immediately after opening the book has made me more than a little untrusting of the book's other dates and facts. Buyer beware."
4,Bible Condition,"I was introduced to this bible in 1991. I purchased one for myself and it was very informative, I loved it so much that I purchase 2 more for 2 of my sisters. In the past I owned two KJV Full Life Study Bibles, once the 2nd bible was worn, I thought that I would purchase another copy. Well, all the Bible Stores that I went to did not sell that particular bible anymore. I saw it on Amazon.com, and I had to have it. At the time the price was higher than what I had paid for mine. Later, I decided to see if they had this bible again. They did, the price was reasonable, so I decided to purchase a used copy. I had never ordered a used product before, so I did not know what to expect, but I wanted this particular bible. When it arrived, I was very excited. It was in excellant condition, now I would not be apprehensive about ordering a used product from Amazon.comJenny, Greensboro, NC"
2,overly dogmatic commentary and articles,"Of course, the Bible itself was great. (I am reviewing this as a pastor within the AoG). The commentay and the articles written within were very narrow in their theology. They were dogmatic on some points that are very debateable, even within pentecostal circles. The article on wine and alcohol were honestly written with very shameful scholarship. The idea that it is sin for a christian to drink alcohol is anti-biblical. Jesus made kool-aid?! ""Mixed wine"" does not refer to wine dilluted with a lot of water, it is different types of wine mixed with spices. The dogmatic eschatology was also troublesome. The basically preached their pre-trib eschatology chart with the same conviction that they preached the divinity of Christ! There was not more then one point of view presented even int he most secondary and controversial matters."
3,1950 What A Year,"We needed a gift for a woman who is retiring from our company after 33 years on the job. She was born in 1950 and we read some excerpts, at her party, from the book. It was worth the purchase price."
4,Power-playing and role-playing in harmony,"This book offers DMs and players the rules to incorporate legacy items into the game. Legacy items are powerful magical items that grow stronger as the wielder gains levels, but the item requires certain sacrifices from the wielder.If you have ever played Earthdawn, you will find some ideas used in the book familiar, which is - I think - more than just a mere coincidence.Using legacy weapons in your game is absolutely not necessary, but they are a great way to reward good role-playing, or to force power-gamers to better role-play their characters.The book contains everything you may need to incorporate weapons of legacy info your game, including special feats, spells, psionic powers, and the rules to build you own magical items of legacy."
4,Weapons of Legacy,"This book provides some excellent rules to implement and develop weapons and items of legendary proportion. I have seen many different rule sets from various sources that create ""leveled"" items that a PC can use throughout their career. Most of them end up creating unbalanced situations. These rules seem to be thoroughly thought out and well balanced. We have already implemented this book into our current campaigns."
2,waste,"mostly a rather incoherent mismash of ideas. Most of the book is a bunch of weapons which are poorly motivated. The new rules are poor; penalties are poorly motivated, and the epic support does not make sense. Save your money"
4,Exceptional weapons,"My playing group is fast approaching epic levels, but their weapons are still boring. I had begun to create exceptional weapons (and gear) that they could take with them over the 20 mark, but it was a slow process to map out how the items would increase in power as the characters did.This book goes into the many steps and details for creating artifacts (as opposed to magical items). It was just what I needed. It helped me balance the power with some drawbacks without making my players feel like I was stealing all the thunder of their new weapon.Written in the style of the core books and other supplements, the Wizards team clearly explains the rules for exceptional items. I have begun using it to create the items for which my players will search and fight in the next several adventures. In fact, the retrieval (or creation) of these items can be a module in and of itself.Well worth buying."
2,Fundamentally flawed.,"This book, while pretty as always, falls way behind WotC's usual standard. The amount of actual content in here could have filled a Dragon article and then it was packed with 50 so-so examples.Please note: In order to use a legacy item, you must take a feat at 5th level. NO character gains a free feat at 5th level. 1st, 3rd, 6th, etc. So this sets back the rules by a level, which are subpar compared against the magical weapons available at those levels anyway. Am I the only one who noticed?"
3,Great Fires and Some Melodrama,"Lau Ching-Wan stars in director Johnnie To's look at fire fighters in Hong Kong. And this is much better than Ron Howard's ""Backdraft."" The final warehouse fire is incredible.However, to get there, one has to sit through some melodramas involving several members of Lau's team (which is said to be jinxed) and some minor emergencies (a car accident, an elevator collapse). Fortunately, these incidents and the characters are worth watching.Nonetheless, it's the warehouse fire that pays off. The DVD also includes an un-subtitled documentary about the filming."
5,Chicago,"I loved this story. Not only were the escapades fun, but it's well-written as well. I was particularly interested because I grew up in a neighborhood not far from the one in the book. Many of the places mentioned were part of my youth."
5,A great read,"This book was entertaining and made me laugh outloud. It reminds the reader the importance of love and quality time with family and friends. I'd love to take a walk down 1950s Chicago and see it through the eyes of these characters. As a second grade teacher, it gave me a new perspective on how my students might perceive me and their world."
3,An Okay Book,"I thought that this book was qiute good but I am getting quite sick of Francine Pascal's ridiculous storylines. Otherwise, the whole mini-series was quite good."
2,"okay, not good.","So, okay. Let's get real here. Paul is an idiot. Always was, always will be. I mean, he's the villian of the story, and he's not only engaged to some idiot named BUNNY he IS an idiot! There. Now, how can HE possibly the mastermind behind everything? I mean, the guy can't even walk without tripping over his own feet, for god's sake!"
3,Good but...,"Not a bad SVU but I really wish Tom and Liz would just get back together! And yet another contradiction, Bruce Patman was a tennis star all through SVH and now all of a sudden he's a terrible player? What happened????"
5,"""BTO Continues To ""Roll On Down The Highway""","I purchased this CD from ""AMAZON"" a few months back,I am very impressed with its content,the Re:recorded ""HITS""and the ""NEW"" tracks are ""OUTSTANDING"".I consider myself a friend and of course one of the groups most ""LOYAL""supporters!With the departure of RANDY BACHMAN IN 1992 to go it alone,the other three original ""NOT FRAGILE""lineup:FRED TURNER,ROBIN BACHMAN&BLAIR THORNTON,added a guitarist by the name of RANDY MURRAY to fill RANDY BACHMANS departure.This lineup is the longest in tenure of any amalgamation in the groups history,I have seen this lineup perform multiple times in the MINNESOTA area,the sound and performance is something to behold!!I will do all I can to make the recording industry wake up and sign this group to a new recording contract!!To those of you out there reading this,order this CD from AMAZON.COM,you will love it!!To FRED,ROB,BLAIR&RANDY.M,""I THANK YOU FOR THE FEELIN""!!!"
4,Trial - not Trail - by Fire!,"BTO hasn't done much recording in recent years, so this collection from 1996 should be of interest to fans of the group. They do 5 new songs, including their version of ""House of the Rising Sun"", and 10 of their oldies. Most are faithful to the original versions, but it's nice to hear a few variations. ""Hold Back the Water"" is done acoustically on this CD, and ""Blue Collar"" has an extended solo by Randy Murray (you gotta see him do this one live - he has that guitar smokin'!). All of the new songs stay within the well defined BTO sound - best of the bunch IMHO are ""Trial by Fire"" and ""Sense of Danger"", spotlighting the great, gruff vocals of bassman C. F. Turner."
5,This is a must buy for any fan!!,"This is the latest cd single by Alanis Morissette. How can I sum it up in more that one word? PERFECT! Joining You is the best song on her new cd, and the version that is contained on this single is even better!! I really wish this song was released in the USA so other people could know how great it is. The b-side, These Are The Thoughts, is just plain great! It starts off with her singing with just a piano and slowly builds throughout the song till it climax's at the end with a beautiful string arrangement. With lyrics like ""how can you say you are spiritual, yet you treat people like sh*t"" proves that Alanis is still the same old Alanis! I wish she would have put this song on her new cd! Peace!"
4,silverware caddy,Great item and serves the purpose. It prevents silverware from falling through the bottom like some other caddys with slotted bottoms.
5,Silverware caddy,The caddy is just what I was looking for. Large enough for my needs but fits nicely on a buffet table.
1,"Not a ""Drainer""","The title of this product is misleading, as it does not drain. Water accumulates in the bottom of it, causing the base to rust if it is used as a drainer."
3,flateware caddy,"Since there were no measurements on the size of the caddy, it is smallerthen what I had in mind. Need to include size of product on your discriptions."
4,Nice Serving Piece,This is great for doing buffets. It is attractive for holding your cutlery. It could stand to be a little larger and weighted more. At this size it probably works better for plastic than my heavier stainless pieces.
5,Genuine Bosch quality,Genuine Bosch quality just like you would get if you bought it at the Mercedes dealer but for less than half the price! Can't beat that!
4,"Great method, but had a hard time with results","I'm a huge fan of ""stack and whack"" style quilts using only one fabric. This book is no exception, and it lets you create quilts that look amazing but use only one fabric.Fabric is what can make or break this quilt, and unfortunately, I've yet to have much success finding the appropriate prints to use this method. Of the five or six I've tried, only one has turned out well due to fabric that is too busy, too many colors, or just plain ""not right.""If you bring a mirror with you to the fabric store (to preview what kaleidoscopes will look like), you will have much better success, so be careful with the fabric (since a failed quilt is EXPENSIVE, as you need 5-6 yards for a lap size) and you'll do fine."
4,A reinvention of quilting altogether!,"Once I picked up this book in a fabric shop and leafed through it, I could not get the idea out of my head. So I HAD to buy the book!Rosenthal makes her special brand of kaleidoscopic quilting look very simple. With clear guidelines and stunning pictures of completed quilts for inspiration, you'll be ready to start!Presently I am searching for a good fabric to use for this project--be warned that not every fabric can work. The selection of colors and prints is key.The only thing that annoyed me about this book is that some instructions are left out, most notably the formation of a hollow block cube. However, I understand that the sequel (One-Block Wonders Encore) includes these directions.I'd recommend this type of quilting to people who like to play with colors and patterns. It's very untraditional, so I can understand why it's not for everyone. As for me, I'm inspired! I'll never see fabric the same way again!"
5,One-Block Wonders,When the book is used in conjuction with a class it is a wonderful teaching tool. The author's visual examples help you in making the best selection of fabric for any of the projects listed in the book. Learning this new technique will open your eyes to the large scale prints in quilt shops that you might otherwise have passed over.
5,One Block Wonders,"The book arrived in a timely manner and I can't wait to get started making my own beautiful blocks. It gives very clear instructions, so you don't need to be an expert to create these blocks."
1,One-Block Wonders,I was excited looking at the first three quilts then it just became more of the same thing and became bored.
2,One Block Wonders,"I was fascinated with the Stack and Whack concept so saw this book and thought it was similar. It is not! Definitely not for the beginner. I have made several quilts but I would never be able to figure this out. Also, I thought these quilts were much too busy."
4,A great stack n whack kaleidoscope technique,Another great book to walk you through the stack n whack kaleidoscope technique. I like how this book takes different sizes of blocks / kaleidoscopes and puts them into one quilt design.
4,Intriguing gateway into hidden secrets of fabric,"The book is well presented with an appropriate blend of descriptive text and clear supportive photos and diagrams. Rosenthal uses a thoughtful structure leading the reader through consecutive stages in clear and effective language. As evidence of the motivating and reassuring qualities of the book I have chosen my fabric and plan to begin my initial one-block wonder quilt soon, so with bated breath mixed with excitement ..."
5,Made up a great quilt,"I asked for this book last Christmas. Had to pry it away from my wife and daughter (both quilters.) We got a large, colorful print, enough to get six repeats(guidance in book.) I pinned the six repeats exactly on top of each other. They cut out many sets of six identical triangles with a rotary cutter. We voted on which of the three ways of making each set into a hexagon was the best. They sewed them together, and laid them out and decided which hexagons went where(guidance in the book.) Some we rejected, because they stuck out too much. The result was a stunning quilt. It is unique: even if two people used the same fabric, they would come up with different results."
2,space force rogue universe,"sounded like a good game but for some reason my computer has a hard time running it, that and the fact that i can't see the stations i'm trying to dock at make it less fun than it sounded. I do not know if this is just a game glitch or just a problem with my graphics card."
1,Save your money!,"This game is poorly made, improperly documented and plays like junk. I can't say enough bad things about this game.I have played many space fighter games in my day and this is the worst!Buy X2 or TARR Chronicles, both are superior games and worth the money spent on them."
3,wtf?,"I LOVED THIS CD, ESP. ""ONE STEP CLOSER"" BY LINKIN PARK; IT'S MY FAVORITE SONG FROM THE CD. I GIVE IT THE 2-STAR DROP, THOUGH, CAUSE IT'S F***KING OVER 35 BUCKS JUST FOR THIS CD!!! BUY IT FROM FYE OR BEST BUY FOR MUCH, MUCH CHEAPER!!!"
5,size 10 dockers = xtra large,I have size 10 dockers and the xtra large fits perfect. I have a pair of workboots size 10 small soles and they are tight need xxl
1,P,"It is really not well designed. Ugly, difficult fit. I sort of imagined the totes overshoes or those old fashioned rubbers that were softer and more pliable. This is hard. Don't waste the money or time."
4,Husband says they are great. His co-workers all want to order.,"We are from the Philadelphia, PA area where we had been hit with snow storms every week for a month straight. My husband is a courier for Fedex Corp. so is outdoors making package deliveries in all kinds of inclement weather. His work boots were getting ruined by all the snow, ice and slush we've had this winter so he asked me to find him a pair of rubber boots to fit over his steel-toed work shoes. I decided to search for them on Amazon and found them right away. He says they are perfect for keeping his shoes from getting ruined while keeping his feet nice and dry. Some of the other couriers asked about getting them too, and he told them to go to Amazon to order and receive within a few days."
2,Not made for sneakers,"Unfortunately, the largest size I can order from my Postal Uniform supplier is size XXL. I wear a size 12 sneaker and while putting the Tingly overshoes on over them, I just about pull my shoulder out of socket trying to pull them on. I hear this same complaint from other carriers I work with as well. Tingly seems to be stuck in the past where everyone still wears wingtips, and conventional dress shoes. I'd bet that 50% of their customers wear them over sneakers. They really need to make their overshoes with more room inside."
3,Works... but a bit too snug for size 12,"I purchased the XL 11-13 version and, despite the great price, they are very difficult to slip on to my size 12 B dress shoes. It seems like I might need the next larger size."
2,What?,"This series is usually great. It is filled with action, adventure, love and all that other good stuff but for this book and the end of the last book I believe my title is appropriate. This book does not exactly deviate from the story line but it does make the characters seem totally different. I mean Hiro was like a stranger in this book. His personality totally changed and Heaven seemed weird too. The only semi-good part of this book is the very end when Heaven finds something out. Other than that though, this book left me wondering if Carrie Asai wrote it. Maybe her publishing company took away her creative freedom or something, I don't know. But this book was a total dissapointment and if she keeps writing like this, I know I won't be purchasing any more of her books."
1,Moon over rubbish,"Oh please. Did someone say this movie is watchable? OK, there are a couple of hot men. That's it. I wish I could say the writing is laughably bad. It's just bad. The acting is...well non-existant. A couple of the appearers can almost change their expressions, which I think is about the extent of their talents. Except of course in hard core porno. I'm sure there they would be great. They are good looking, have beautiful bodies and are impressively well-hung. But please, don't ask them to act. Don't let the so-called writer put fingers to keyboard again and do the world a favour[...]. Above all, don't buy this [...] thing. It really is unwatchable."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This best of collection covers the second period of Georgie Fame's recording career from 1967-1971 and the five albums released during this period.Compared to his early recordings with the Blue Flames many of these tracks are heavier arranged with jazzy horn-arrangements which you may either like or hate. Personally, I prefer the more relaxed arrangements of songs like ""Peaceful"" and ""Yellow Man"". Another stand-out track is the soulful ""Knock on Wood"", which may be the song that comes the closest to his early sound.The hit-single ""The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde"" is still fine and amusing and also ""Because I Love You"" is quite good.His jazzy main-stream covers of songs like ""Mellow Yellow"", ""And I Love Her"", ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" and ""This Guy's in Love With You"" seem unnnecessary and uninteresting.All in all this is a mixed bag with Fame's great vocals as the connecting thread."
5,Quite simply a pleasure to read. . . .,"Mr. Esolen has done the english-bound reader a fine service: we are drowning in Dantes, up to our eyeballs in Homers and Virgils and Ovids, but where are the compulsively readable and poetically enjoyable modern translations of Pulci, Boiardo, Ariosto, and not least of all Camoes, who has written the most neglected major epic in Western literature, ""The Lusiads""! Most thankfully, Mr. Esolen has given us Tasso's ""Jerusalem Delivered,"" which in his magnificent translation is quite simply a pleasure to read--I could not put it down! If you are intimidated by ""classic literature,"" don't be--this english Tasso is just a jolly good adventure/love story. If you enjoy this, and you will, then let's hope Mr. Esolen will favor us with his rendition of Ariosto's ""Orlando Furioso"" in the not-to-distant-future!!!"
5,An Epic Read,"I am just about to finish this translation of Tasso's venerable crusade and I just had to express how wonderful I think it is. I have to admit I experienced a slight bit of trepidation before beginning this work, but I was found to be foolish. Not only is the work readable, it loses none of its beauty in the translation. I have found myself reading page to page hungrily. Who needs mass market paperback best sellers when oen has such a unique and beautifully translated work at one's fingertips. I wholeheartedly recommend this translation."
3,Review of BluegrassBanjo by Peter Wernick,"I really needed more of a beginners book, also, my book didnot have a cd in the back. I believe that could help me.Kay Clower"
2,Somewhat dated,"The problem with information on learning the banjo isn't a lack thereof - it's just the opposite. There are tons of available books, CDs, DVDs, online printed and video lessons; some free, some at a minimal cost.This particular one is from a series that includes bluegrass guitar, bluegrass mandolin, and others. I had used the guitar and mandolin books back in the 80s, so ordered this for the banjo. Two principal complaints: the first is that the tablature is hand-drawn, with notes ""on top"" of the assigned string, rather than ""in"" it. Example:__0__versus --0--No doubt an artifact of when it was published, before computers and .txt files.The other is that it contains a 33 rpm thin plastic record, rather than a CD. Much less user-friendly; again, a function of when it was published."
3,"great band, average album","It's hard to live up to your past, but when you have created an album as engaging as ""Lost Souls"" expectations will forever be raised.""Some Cities"" and even ""The Last Broadcast"" can't match the depth of Doves debut album. Tracks like ""Black and White Town"" and the title track are deginitely worth listening to, but I can't see this album dominating my cd player (ipod) the way that ""Lost Souls"" did...does?"
2,Aggressively Mediocre,"I thought the first record, ""Lost Souls"" was masterful. The second record had definite moments but was not nearly as good as the first. This, their third CD, just doesn't do anything for me at all. I think these guys might be caught up in the album-tour-album cycle and it's killing their creativity."
3,"Big Doves fan, but this CD is not their best","The playing and singing is more loose and raw this time, so if you particularly liked the symphonic sounds of their last 2 CD's you may be disppointed by this CD. Their new playing-style would be fine, if it weren't that the songs also are often less-melodic than what I would have expected. The lead vocals are in a few tracks not studio-over-dubbed and the faults in his voice are distracting. For me, this is their least interesting CD and I REALLY liked the first two. I liked their live DVD too. Just be aware this is a different and lesser sound than before."
4,pay no mind...,to any person who rates this record less than four stars. what more could one possibly ask for? here you have a record that actually exceeds lyrically and sonically both _lost souls_ and _last broadcast_! Imagine that! j goodwin's brilliant. enough said.
2,What a disappointment,"I hate Coldplay. For starters they're not very good -- at their absolute best (""Yellow"") they were a passable impersonation of Catherine Wheel. At their worst they're essentially the new Doves album, 'Some Cities.'It kills me to say, but this album is an homage to Coldplay's style of crap/emo rock. There's far too much GOOD music out there these days to bother with the process of letting an album 'grow' on you, the common theme of all the reviewers who've posted so far. I've given this pig four listens and each time I want it to end.The only decent song is ""Walk on Fire"" because it has catchy guitar hooks, doesn't involved useless wailing, and makes you want to hear the next track. In other words it's more of a classic Doves tune. That's why it gets two stars and not one.I know 85 people will rip me for this writeup but if it saves one person from wasting their money then I've done my good deed for the day."
5,Another great Doves Album,Doves somehow retain their great sound yet always expand further into their musical expression.This band adds to Last Broadcast and Lost Souls.Someday Soon is my favorite song on this album. But every song compliments one another.I cannot wait for the next Doves album.
2,"this is no ""Lost Souls""!","I bought ""Lost Souls"" and was just blown away by how awesome it was. Then I bought this, expecting more greatness, and I was sincerely and tremendously disappointed. It is not even in the same ballpark as ""Lost Souls"", and it's sort of hard to believe it's the same band. Oh well-maybe their next one will be better."
2,Being that two stars equal one okay song,"I'm not one to exert my opinion on anyone but, now that there's an opportunity... I think that all the songs are ok in them-selves but combined on this one albulm was like listening to that one song over and over again, that is, judging by the samples provided. There was no progression, the only reason i tuned into all the songs was because i was giving the next song the benefit of the doubt in hearing a different tune!"
2,totally middle of the road new order ripoff,"like Coldplay and Travis and Starsailor (the total worst!), this band plays it way safe and bland. the production (slick to the point of unctuousnes) is partly at fault, but the main offender is the vanilla-ization of the vocals plus the lack of interesting melodies...there was an early 90s bandcalled THE RAILWAY CHILDREN who, in purloining from New Order, at least had GOOD SONGS....these doves don't fly...sorry for the feeble pun, but heck, kiddies... i have purchased and subsequently sold immediately back all three doves albums now...the hope is over..."
4,"Not bad, but far from their best","In 2004, I felt Starsailor was stepping in the toes of both, Doves and Coldplay, with their release ""Silence is Easy"", yet I didn't give them five stars, because the album was repetitive after a while. It seems that 2005 won't be all that different for Doves' ""Some Cities"". While a very good album (arguable better than Starsailor's), the band's third effort still is nowhere near their first two productions.After having listened to it a couple of times, as much as I enjoy their sound, it doesn't quite catch me. There's one more attempt left for this kind of music in 2005: the release of the new Coldplay, in May. We'll see how that one turns out. If it ends up being a flop, it may mark the last days of this sound that peaked in popularity some time in 2002."
2,I should've seen this coming,"Dear Coldplay,We here in the Doves love your work (& Gwnyeth, wink wink nudge nudge). So we've decide to make our own Coldplay record. That's right!! And boy is it dull. You'll love it. I know the vacuous trendy girls do!! (wink wink nudge nudge)Take Care, your friendsThe Doves"
4,'tis Doves themselves,"This album is the Doves, pure and simple.If that description seems intriguing to you then Some Cities would be a wise purchase.With Some Cities the Doves discover that they have their own established style which they can move around in and enjoy. It has examples of elements that made both of their previous albums (Lost Souls, Last Broadcast) unique and terriffic, while also showing signs of the things those albums shared.This album represents a bit of a holding pattern but not a muck through boring formula like we heard from other brittish bands this year (Coldplay, I'm looking in your direction).Some Cities is the sound of a very good band comfortable with its self, and is the perfect album for fans firmly with them.Initiates might do better to hear the earlier ones first.Read their respective descriptions to decide which one suits you best."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Justice League of America Archives, Vol. 4 (DC Archive Editions is 240 pages this time. The actual contents of this hardbacked beast are the issues numbered from 23-30 of Justice League of America. It also includes the covers from those issues, as well, as an added bonus. There are cover shots on the back of some things."
3,Not His Finest Effort,"It's not that I disagree with Walzer's ideas in ""Politics and Passion,"" it's that I find them unexceptionable to a rather boring degree. Even the title essay lacks the fire that I look for in a political essay. Unless the reader wishes to be a Michael Walzer ""completist,"" to read every word he writes, I would suggest purchasing an earlier collection called ""Arguing About War."" Walzer at his best is possibly our most humane political thinker, and an essay such as ""Can There Be a Decent Left"" would be required reading in my utopia. I eagerly await his next book and hope it avoids the blandness of this one."
5,You'll be stoked,Bought this for my surfer brother-in-law. He was stoked. Loved the book and is still trying to find himself in one of the photos. All surfers will enjoy this book. Makes a great gift.
2,A Califorian view of surfing,"Kampion has the sixties cult outlook on the sport of surfing and his book reflects that perspective. As with the many other ""official"" history books of surfing most of the facts are accurate."
5,A National Surf Treasure,"Drew Kampion has been chronicling the surfing subculture since the start of the modern era. With ""Stoked!"" he's produced THE defintive history of this ""thing of ours."" (As a surf-writer myself, Kampion's stylistic influence has been indelible.) There is no one else in his class.This guy is a national surf treasure. If you surf, read him. (If you don't surf, please don't start.)"
4,Perfect for any surfer,"Lots of details about the history, and full of cool photos! One of the most comprehensive guides to surfing out there and recommended by many experts in the field. Covers surfing in the key spots around the world...."
2,Wrong model,Ordered top for 98 Jeep wrangler and received top for 95 model. I put the correct make and model into their form and thought I was getting the right one. The process selected the wrong model number which they delivered. The process should not have let me order a top for a vehicle different from the one that I selected. Amazon quickly delivered the top and made arrangements with UPS to pick it up the next day.
5,SUPER DRIVING WHEEL FOR LITTLE TODDLERS WHO WANT TO DRIVE.,"MY GRANDSON JUST LOVES THE ""DISCOVERY EXCLUSIVE STEERING WHEEL'. WE PUT IT ON THE FRONT OF HIS STOLLER AND AS WE PUSH HIM DOWN THE SIDEWALK HE STEERS. I JUST WISH IT HAD SOMEWAY TO ATTACH IT TO ANOTHER OBJECT."
1,UNCUT DIAMOND,"A VERY GOOD BAND, BUT THIS IS NOT THEIR BEST WORK. NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BAND'S ABILITY. SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS RECORDED IN A GARAGE"
5,A MUST for De Palma fans!,"There aren't too many books out there on De Palma, so when I saw this one I was very excited. I must say, I wasn't disappointed when I got it. Great interviews that are very informative, covering the majority of his films throughout his fascinating career. De Palma comes off as a very intelligent, humourous man, and his thoughts on films and directing are refreshingly frank and wise. A must-own companion to ""The Devil's Candy"" and ""Double De Palma"", this book should be on every film buff's nightstand. Except the ones who suck."
5,Tropicana and Cuban music comes alive!,This was a pure joy for the eyes and ears. Fantastic production of songs and dances that brought back the memories of Pre-Castro Cuba.Wonderful and most entertaining. Real value for money! I wish we could get other DVDs celebrating the music and dances of Cuba 1930 - 1960 celebrated by the artists from Cuba.
3,i though it didn't deliver.,"could have been better. some people will like it. it had it's moments. not great,not bad. watch it on netfilx."
2,"LAME - This movie should be the wheelchair, not Barry Bostwick!","Had potential, but didn't live up to it. After awhile it fell into a stream of ghetto street slang bits (which were funny for the first ten minutes.) Barry Bostwick gives it whatever watchability it possesses, but it's not enough to warrant buying this one. Rent it... it's not worth buying if you're over 17 years old. Peace - out."
2,"Awesome trailer, horribly unfunny movie","I couldn't wait to get my hands on this movie after seeing the trailer, which was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. After seeing the whole movie, the 90 second trailer was the best part by far as it had almost all of the funny lines in the entire 90 minute movie. Most of the movie was downright stupid with scenes with Abe Lincoln and a campaign stop in Georgia with a ""Repube"" and his wife going on for a long time and being massively unfunny. Also, the Axis werewolf leaders were incredibly lame, and things like the fetishs of FDR's secretary and his son were more messed up and disturbing than funny. I badly wanted this movie to live up to the trailer, but it's not even close. My recommendation is to wait until it's available for rental instead of spending the money to buy it."
4,Interesting,The book was interesting with points that I had never thought of or would look at from his point of view.
5,A Moving Novel of Post-Apartheid South Africa,"Galgut's well written and thoughtfully conceived novel offers a compelling view of challenging issues facing post-apartheid South Africa today. The relationship between the two central characters, Frank (a doctor at a remote hospital) and Laurence, an American who is doing a year of community service there, serves as the anchor for the book's larger themes of commitment, friendship, service, and loyalty within the context of a country that has been torn apart by racial and class divides. The writing is simply first rate and this haunting book will stay with you long after you complete its final page. If you enjoy Coetzee's work (as I do), you will find this novel of great interest as well."
2,A great disappointment!,"I actually ordered two copies of the book (one for myself and another as a Christmas gift)in great anticipation of a great read. I was very disappointed with the scope of the novel. The author fails on many accounts. First, the reader does not get a great sense of location - quite ambigously depicted. Also, one does not get the sense despite the title of ""doctor"" that the author knows much about medicine. The character is not well developed and really doesn't give ""a damn"" about them. I wonder how this novel even got nominated for the Booker????"
2,Corroding ring,"Not only does the cap not seal, but once the rubber sealing ring that surrounds the cap rips and corrodes off, as it did on mine after 2 months, then the only thing the shaker is good for is measuring recipes. I had to find a new bottle to store the dressing in, and the MIU Dressing Shaker is now collecting dust in my cupboard."
1,lousy item,"the stopper will not seal once it hits the oil in the dressing. useless, but would cost me as much to send it back as the cost of the item itself, so it will sit on my shelf until i can find another use for it. very disappointed."
2,Unsatisfied,"There are helpful recipes on the bottle, however the stopper is not secure. I do not feel safe storing fresh made salad dressing in my refridgerator in this bottle."
1,Cracked twice,"Over the past 6 months I order two of these. The first one developed long cracks down the length of the bottle and slowly leaked into my kitchen cabinet. I figured it might not have tolerated the heat in the dishwasher and ordered another one, making sure not to put it through the dishwasher. The second bottle developed the same type of crack, but much bigger, seemingly on its own, causing the dressing to leak badly all over the cabinet and causing bad damage to the wood. I'd stay away from this product as the damage from what appears to be a faulty product can be much more substantial than just the bottle and the salad dressing."
2,Nice except for the low quality rubber ring,This is the second one I have owned. The design is great over all and works for mixing salad dressings and anything else well. Recipes on the container are handy. The fatal flaw is a low quality rubber sealing ring that will crack and fall off if ever it ends up in the dishwasher. Without this piece the shaker is next to useless. I tried to fix with a standard o-ring of that dimension but the fit is no good. Does anyone know where to find a replacement rubber ring that is dishwasher safe? Cheers.
2,alp,"The top doesn't seal so shaking and storing the dressing can only be done with tinkering. Also, the bottle being so narrow it's hard to clean."
3,Spanish Translation of Defy Not the Heart,"This book is in Spanish.From the back cover:A fin de defender su castillo de aquellos que uieren tomarlo por la fuerza, la reina de diecisiete años acuerda un matrimonio de conveniencia con Ranulf, un gigante con tropas bajo su mando.La reina ofrece a Ranulf un título y respetabilidad; él le brinda su lealtad y sus armas. Ella jamás había soñado siquiera con sentir la fiera pasión de ese haombre; Ranulf nunca imaginó que capturaría el corazón de la joven reina.En esas tierras en guerra, nadie creía en el amor."
1,Useless,"There was not enough product information on Amazon site, or elseI would not have bought this item. This is not what I expected.When you say ""Flash Cards"", my understanding was that it would beindex cards that I could thumb-tack on the walls in my office/room."
1,Useless....Just take good notes,"This product is not worthy of your money....These are just global review of general topics. If you read the book, you won't need these. If you need these, you won't pass the test. Don't fall into Rita's clever web of buying her stuff...which is repackaged material. It's all in the book...."
4,Good but...,"This is a good book but not great. I prefer PMP Flashcard Quicklet by Paul Sanghera, which is very self contained and comprehensive. This book by Rita has quite a few errors and too many references to Rita's other books (not self contained)...as a second flashcard book, it's fine."
4,The Catalyst for Millennium Career Marketing,I read this book from cover to cover in 1995 and it catapulted my career in Recruiting and Online Consulting. It gave pertinent information for career marketers and job seekers who wanted to branch into the unknown. It did not boast of 100% guarantees but it promised information and delivered. I am a long time fan of Kennedy.
3,Zoe jokes about being a lion,"This little book may be a bit confusing for young children. Zoe, a character from Sesame Street, decides to dress up as a lion for Halloween. She enjoys it so much she decides to dress up a bit early and spends the day in costume meeting her friends from Sesame Stree in the park. She roars and pounces like a lion, but doesn't understand it when she is not invited by Big Bird to a party that takes place the next day. She goes to the party and apologizes to everyone for ""joking"" with them the day earlier as she takes off the lion costume. I'm not sure that there is a clear message here. It seems that the lesson may be that imagining is good, but too much can have bad consequences. In any case, young children might have fun considering Zoe using her imagination to be a lion."
1,Warning!! This is NOT Paranormal Activity 3!,"Well, I finally fell for one. I saw the cover art, the font style, ""..ormal Activity 3"" and hit the Rent button. I thought I was renting Paranormal Activity 3, but they got me. I just spent my money on ABNORMAL Activity 3.I guess this is a spoof on the Paranormal Activity series, but so far (15min in) it's not worth the $2. Maybe the rest of it will be interesting enough to be background noise for a lazy Saturday afternoon.We'll see......Nope. Despite one or two scenes that made me chuckle, this was a poorly done movie; worse than a 1st year film student.I wonder if someone could create a spam filter for video rentals. I'll just have to read title's and descriptions more carefully in future."
1,what a horrible movie!!,"I've just freaking waste 1:30hr of my live to watch this piece of crap,friendly suggestion: Do not waste your valuable time of watching this crap. It will makes you wanna suicide"
1,Waste of money,"I can not think of much else to say other then this was a complete waste of money. I was looking for Paranormal Activity, and this was an accident. I was prepared to watch because I enjoy most movies."
1,Touche',"I've been wanting to watch Paranormal Activity 3 for a long time, I missed it in the theaters because of school. Netflix is too expensive for me to wait for the movie. So Paranormal Activity 3 only 2.99 on Amazon Video seemed a perfect fit, that was until my stupid butt realized I paid for Abnormal Activity 3, the only thing that I could possibly find funny about this movie will be years from now when I look back on this moment and realize what a fool I was for not paying attention. The only scary part about this movie is that schmucks like me paid 2.99 USD to watch it when we could all pay about 2 bucks each and go down the street and get the movie we really wanted at a red box kiosk. To the creators of this movie I hope your soul burns in the darkest pit of he11 for eternity, some of you may know that area by it's other name; Riverside California."
4,Ultimately Scrumptious!,"My husband got this for me after I bungled about four batches of cookies in a row. I haven't bungled one since. The recipes range from the simple and traditional: the ultimate chocolate chip, the ultimate oatmeal, and the ultimate sugar cookies, to brownies and bars (the lemon bars are PERFECT), to more unusual: specialty and holiday/party cookies. If ever I need a recipe for krumkake or orange madeleines, pizzelles or springerle, I know where I'll go.The recipes are well organized and easy to execute. The pictures are in mouth-watering color and plentiful. My little boy loves to page through it to look at all the yummy varieties. If I had one criticism, it would be that this book should really be spiral bound, for those of us who really USE our cookbooks in the kitchen!"
4,"Nice coasters, Imperfect Stand","The coasters are nice and as pictured. However, they do not fit in the stand. It is imperfect or defective. Luckily I had already planned to store them in a pretty box on my cocktail table."
1,Arrived shattered twice,I ordered these. They came in a cardboard box with NO PADDING. They shattered. I asked for replacements and asked them to pad them. Those ALSO shattered because they weren't padded. The third time I called they said they can't promised they'd be padded and gave me a refund! They won't send them again because they can't tell the shipping people to pad them. Ridiculous.
5,This book explains the natural power of living.,"This extraordinary book explains the powerful life of one woman in a way that impacts us all. The interconnectedness of living, learning and loving are demonstrated through the author's personal experiences which travel through europe, New York City and even Bennington, Vermont. Somehow the improbable happenings of her life find a way of relating closely to our own. I recommend this book."
2,Not as good as Nature Made,"I gave SAM-e a try, but bought the Nature Made Complete brand (200 mg). I noticed a positive difference in my mood and energy level. I don't mean that I felt an overwhelming since of euphoria or anything like that...at least that wasn't the case from my experience. The difference was subtle, yet noticiable. I didn't tell my wife I had started taking it, yet she also noticed the difference. I decided to keep taking it, and switched to this, less expensive option. I do believe there is a difference in what you get. I have noticed no benefit at all from the Source Naturals brand. I'll continue to take it since I paid for it, but I wish I had stayed with Nature Made and will switch back over to them once these are gone. (no, I do not work for Nature Made!)"
5,Good Value,"I bought this brand to compare it with the Life Fitness brand that I bought from CVS. This is as good as the Life Fitness brand for a lower price. It is also packed in blister foil for maximum protection which is not mentioned in the description.In my opinion, if you have tried an expensive brand of SAMe and it helped you, then the Source Naturals brand is probably just a good for much less. At least this was my expereince.I am not in the medical profession but I read that it is recommended to take a B complex vitamin supplement with SAMe, and since this brand does not contain B complex unlike the Life Fitness brand, then you may want to buy B complex separately."
1,Cheaper but not as good,"I started taking the Spring Valley brand in January and loved it, better moods, less joint pain and the diet I've been on for the last year finally started working. I lost 25 lbs in 2.5 months. Then I switched to the source naturals to save money. It was twice the quantity for the same price. I noticed a difference within a week. I'm irritated, moody and depressed again and my joint pain has increased. I tried doubling the dose, but saw no effect. I'm going back to the Spring Valley brand."
4,"Melts in your hand, not in your mouth ...","This works great but the enteric coating melts just in the temperature inside my home! It sticks to my hand, to other tablets, to the different tablets inside my vitamin container ..."
4,My Vet Prescribed SAMe For My Dog,"My Shih Tzu's liver enzymes were over the top and the vet told to to give him SAMe. Truthfully I don't know if they helped, but I gave him the pills daily for about 3 months, along with Milk Thistle and a change of diet, and his numbers dropped back to normal.I bought the first package at a health food store and paid almost twice as much as I did on Amazon.Something worked and it just may have been the SAMe. The main thing is that he is fine now and full of piss and vinegar."
3,"Great quality, but SAMe did nothing for me","This was a hard product to rate. Source Naturals is great quality, so if SAMe works for you, then this is a 5-star product. However, SAMe did not work for me, so SAMe as a general supplement gets 0 stars."
3,"Was fine, but now it won't ship","I am signed up for Subscribe and Save. I got two deliveries of this product, but the next one didn't come. Now I have discovered that with no explanation, and no way of finding out why, it will no longer be shipped to Alaska! Weird. I am not impressed by the service, though the product was all right. Not as good as Nature Made, but all right."
2,Slow and Tepid,"A slow and tepid tale of the Vietnam era. Set in New Jersey, the central character is a teenage boy who is trying to deal with growing up in a time of changing values. His father works at a gun factory, but he falls in with an odd leftist who runs a local hotel and is the main anti-war organizer in the town. Loads of typical events occur: golden-boy older brother goes to Vietnam and gets killed, Mrs. Robinson syndrome as boy gets involved with the older activist, boy becomes estranged from parents, parents refuse to admit futility of older sons death, blah, blah, blah. I think you had to have lived through the times to remotely enjoy this book."
1,Not as nice as it looks here,"I was very disappointed with this ""gourmet"" basket. I bought it to donate to a charity for a chinese auction for Breast Cancer/Haiti Relief. it was so embarassing- I had to dress it up big time. It looks nothing like it does in the picture. The items are woefully cheap....the crackers were pathetic....one of the packages was open no less. The itty bitty sausage was wrapped with wrapping paper as though it were some sort of prize! That tiny weeny was pretty disappointing, as was the puny sliver of cheese that is included. Pathetic! Also, one of the boxes was crushed. There was one decorative green sprig...that was it. The bow was tied on the side of the basket instead of the front. The whole thing was just awful. Everyone I showed it to said, ""You paid 90 dollars for THAT???????"" I say...>SAVE YOUR MONEY and purchase these items in a real brick and mortar store if you can. Otherwise, prepare to be disappointed. (but the actual basket was nice, I will say that)."
3,Disappointed,"This product was exactly what I was looking for: underwire, full torso length, cups that mold to the body, etc. Unfortunately, I had a lot of difficulty getting it on and off. I bought a 3X which ""should"" have fit a woman weighing up to 275 lbs (I weigh about 180). The fabric was so tight that it created tremendous back boobs which I think are uglier than a sagging front. The garment may be appropriate for a slender young thing, but this fat old woman will probably return it. From the way it fit me, I evidently would need to order at least a 5X which probably isn't manufactured."
5,family love,I was so glad i found this this is my dad's favorite movie and when i got it for him on Christmas it was one of the best feelings ive had in my life
2,3 STOOGES GO... is one of the reasons they went,"One of the Stooges' last and arguably their least starring feature film. I sure hope all the good stuff happens in the final reels, 'cause I've never been able to stay awake very long when watching it.Columbia, what the heck are you doing? There's plenty more short subjects out there, and some fairly decent Stooge features (HAVE ROCKET WILL TRAVEL, 3S IN ORBIT, and especially 3S MEET HERCULES) so why are we getting this turkey?"
2,"Good Film, Bad DVD","My favorite Three Stooges film of the 1960s features deserves much better.Columbia's DVD presents THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE in its original widescreen format. But although it's advertised as ""remastered,"" the visual quality leaves much to be desired... grainy overall, with several low contrast moments.Even though no classic Curly or Shemp short subject is included as a bonus, they advertised the DVD to include trailers. BUT, they aren't Stooge trailers... just three trailers for other upcoming Columbia comedy discs.Columbia dropped the retail price ... It wasn't enough. This DVD's presentation quality is not much better than some bargain basement pd vendors...Message to Columbia & Sony: between the Stooges' great legacy, and the profitable property they've been to you for the past 70 years... the fans and the Stooges deserve better! Very disappointing DVD!!!"
3,Missing brake line adapter,"This master cylinder appears to be fine, but the port size did not match my OEM brake lines. It came with one of the necessary adapters, but the other (for the front port) was not included. This necessitated a lengthy trip to several auto parts stores before a suitable adapter could be found. Given the distance, extra cost and added effort, I would have been better off buying the part locally. I can't find any info on the warranty, but most competitors offer a lifetime warranty on the identical part."
4,For One Video Card with Two Monitors (PC),"Don't waste your money on this version, get the standard version. While it does say on the box and common marketing material that it supports multiple displays, what it does not point out is that this is only true (PC) if you have a video card-PER-display! If you are a mac user you can ignore this annoyance.I am extremely frustrated that ColorVision does not make this very clear in their comparison of versions.Otherwise the calibration is fine, I have not tested the printer side of the software just yet."
4,Good Product,I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me. I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software. The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.
4,Monitor Profile Color Fix,"Spyder Pro Sensor works well, print fix program is a joke!I now have true colors on my LCD screens setup was efforless, happy with proformance.It now seems that i cant get anything to print correctly to match the screen though? Printfix program includes is meant to fix this but is slow and labot intensive to get anything calibrated, waste huge ammounts of ink and paper?"
5,Monitor Calibrator,Very pleased with ColorVision's Spyder2PRO monitor calibrator. Easy to use and produces great results. The colors in the digital photos that I print and what I order online now match what I see on my monitor.
3,On the Fence...,"I specifically purchased Spyder2Pro to calibrate my MacBook Pro 17"" to a new Dell Ultrasharp 2407WFP. After many failed attempts to get the Dell to look closer to my MBP display with its built-in Dell monitor controls, I turned to Spyder2Pro because I mirror the display. I ran it a few times with different settings, but I honestly have not found the right profile yet. It certainly looks better than it did before but some colors are just not right and that bothers me. My problems are blues look too purple, tans lean towards orange, and whites have a cast. As a Web Designer, I want better accuracy when proofing my sites on my own monitor before I present to clients and see it on their different monitors. I have not tested the printer side of the software yet. I'm on the fence as to whether I'd recommend the product."
3,Spyder2PRO not clear,"We purchased the Spyder2PRO after reviewing the information on Colovision's website. Because of a delay in loading the program, the return timeframe from the 3rd party supplier had already passed. When we loaded it, we found out that it was incomplete. We had not received all we THOUGHT we were getting. We really needed PrintFix PRO suite. I take responsibility for loading it late, and not being able to return it. When I called Colorvision, they were very helpful, and for an additional several hundred dollars, supplied what I needed.I think Spyder2PRO needs to supply more accurate information to their retailers and to their customer relations people. We find the product to be helpful rather easy to use."
1,"NOT Accurate, Annoying Process","I was happy to finally get my many computers aligned with the proper calibration tool. Unfortunatley, this is a failed product. I tried calibrating many of my computers - a have a dual screen LCD setup, another wide screen design machine, and 3 laptops. I used the Spyder on 4 of them already, and it's really awful. Why are these reviews so good - this product is weak, too complicated, asks for too many manual adjustments and has not really calibrated anything. It's really just been a waste of my time. I am going to search for a real tool. This is just terrible."
1,Mistake buying Spyder2PRO,Bad judgment on my part for buying the Colorvision Spyder2PRO. I want to calibrate my DLP TV. This product will not do that.Colorvision's instructions for this gear are poor.
4,I would have rather given this 3.5 stars...,I bought this because I try to take photography seriously and needed my images to look right on the screen while editing.The software does an okay job of getting this done right.My problem is with the printer calibration software in that it supports a limited amount or printers.I have four Epson printers none of which are supported.It's kind of disappointing for the price you pay for this.-Mario
1,Not worth the effort,I had better results without using this thing. It changed my monitor color so much that I could not get a photograph printed as good as just using my defaults on my printer & Monitor. It may be good for some people but it did not work for me. I had to return it.
4,"Great Monitor Calibration, ok printer calibration","I bought this product because it has the best value: a lower cost compared to its competitors, and ability on calibrate monitors and printers.Setup is easy, takes about 10 mins, and gives multiple options for standards to calibrate against, such as sRGB. Measures gamma, color temp, and blk & wht luminances, and has ability to make ICC profiles (maybe edit too?)Printer unit works by calibration against known setting from paper type and ink. No spectrophotometer unit to verify color absorption."
5,Great Book to Buy for Birthday Favors,I purchased 20 of these books to give out with crayons for my son's first birthday. They were a hit and reasonably priced..
2,Item not as pictured,"I purchased this item after ordering a different style unicorn cookie cutter from a different seller... much to my dismay, it was exactly the same of the first one I bought. I contacted the seller, and was told ""Amazon allows other sellers to duplicate our listings and somehow our listings always get messed up. We have never had the cutter in the picture on the listing. I do apologize for any inconveniences."" There was no offer to exchange it for a cutter I don't already have.If you don't have the item as pictured... take another picture and submit it."
5,Great Gift,This make s great gift for unicorn lovers! If your are looking for a baker that loves unicorns this is it. Cutter is a nice one does not look cheap. I would be very happy to give this as a gift!
3,Fun but could have been even better,"While more fun than the original as we have really enjoyed the Pirate twist, we agree with a couple other comments that the money is too fragile and the houses and hotels are not quite enough. We know that Hasbro wants to keep some of the original Monopoly theme, but the Jail should have been changed to the Brig and Free Parking should have been changed to Free Docking."
4,collectables,this game was bought as a gift for a grandson who still has monopoly jr. He's been collecting them and playing them ever sience
4,Not what I expected....,"I was a bit disappointed playing this version...I've only ever played the original. I didn't like the Money, and while the playing pieces are different, some of them are sort of dorky; I could have come up with better one's if I do say so myself. Some of the original symbols like Parking seem Stupid on a Pirate based game, they could have come up with something different. Not sure I like this version, I loved my British set and my Las Vegas set better than this one, they just made more sense being land based. They are Really Coming Out with some silly one's now....Sponge Bob Square Pants Monopoly? C'mon Mattel...Ridicules."
3,Monopoly stills a family game,"Well, after all those year Monopoly stills as classic family game, the fun is always present with this game, but the quality of the components it is a problem, the money bills are very fragile and the cards too, there are a very limited number of houses and hotels, it should be bigger!Anyway, monopoly is my fav game!"
1,boring and pictureless,"While I learned a great deal from Tesla from another website and online journal and patent information, this book almost had the effect of me not being too interested. I think it is due to the fact that most pictures are not being printed at all (black squares cover them. Not happy and rather had my money back.For those who are interested in Tesla go here http://www.tfcbooks.com/"
1,Fully illustrated? With nice black boxes!,"This book is not really illustrated.Most of the figures are just black boxes.So, it is nearly useless.That ain't working..."
3,It is ok,I am not sure how well this works. I think it makes my hair smell and feel wonderful. I do notice a difference in how the different colors of my hair stand out when I use it but I cannot say it is a dramatic difference. I still really like it though. I like it more than the shampoo which I do not think does anything for my hair.
3,"Ok, but not great","I may have misread, but these glove were not what I expected. I was expecting full neoprene construction reinforced by the synthetic suede palms, but that is not what they are. The gloves have neoprene backs, and synthetic suede palms, not full neoprene, so once the get wet they are not as comfortable and not very warm. They also take quite a while to dry out. If half neoprene and half synth gloves are what you want these are ok, but I wanted full neoprene construction with reinforced palms, so I would not buy these gloves again."
4,great glove,"Keeps hands warm in tropical water, very comfy, and great price. I use these for spearfishing and I often forget that I'm wearing them"
4,Very comfortable,"Used these on a recent snorkeling and spearfishing trip to the Pacific Ocean - comfortable fit, kept me and coral from damaging each other."
2,not waterproof,"I entered waterproof gloves in my Amazon search.These gloves fit very well and are comfortable, but the synthetic suede is not waterproof. Strange for diving gloves."
1,WARNING,This is NOT an audio CD as promised in description. This is just the Japanese version of the Live In Cuba DVD with bonus CD. Don't buy. I had to return :-{
3,Edited release and bad framing sinks this cool movie.,"Rock n' Roll Cop was one of the few movies in which Anthony Wong Chau Sang doesn't play a weird, psycho or a slimeball. The super hot Carrie Ng co-stars as a gun moll and Yu Rong Guang co-stars as well playing the evil mainland Chinese criminal who's on the run looking for Carrie. Kirk Che Wong shot this movie with several brutal scenes which earned it a Cat. III rating. But the DVD release is edited and full screen. When will they re-release this action packed gem?Recommended for Anthony Wong fans."
4,Excellent for playing songs from JCS,"The songs included in this book are Heaven on Their Minds, Everything's Alright, Hosanna, Pilate's Dream, Last Supper, Gethsemane, King Herod's Song, and Superstar. A few things should be noted: Firstly, Heaven on their Minds does not include the ""all gone sour"" last four verses that are used in live productions of jcs. Instead the song is written to fade away. That might present a problem to people performing or using that song for an audition. The last supper only includes the chorus that the apostles sing. Superstar is tuned to a C instead of the original E that is on all of the recordings and live productions. Other than that, all the other keys are the same as you might hear them on cd recordings, 1973 movie, and live productions. Chords are also included for guitar players."
3,Good book for beginners,"This book contains the partitures of the songs mentioned in Uppercase in the Editorial's review and the lyrics for all the other songs of this great rock-opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The partitures are written for piano, with chords for guitar and lyrics, and are quite faithful to the original songs. They aren't difficult, so you can play them without too much troubles and remember with pleasure the voices of Yvonne Elliman, Carl Anderson, Ted Neeley and the other artists. This book doesn't give you a complete satisfaction if you are instead looking for a more ""seriously"" thing, with all the partitures including the instrumental songs."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the fact that music to all the songs were not included in the book. The nine songs that are in are good but to leave out the songs with Judas and the High Priests and Jesus and Pilate and Simon Zealots is not right.
4,JC SuperStar Piano Edition,"Although this score does not include all the intermittent recitatives and orchestral arrangemtnts, it does offer a good piano transcription of the major songs with words. For anyone wnating to use any of the songs of JCS, this publication is very good."
3,Wouldn't buy it again.,"DH, the blade is marked ""USA"".I should have read the other review first, this wasn't really what I was looking for, I was looking for a Gerber like the Bear Grills folder but without the serrations. It looks like the Freeman Guide Folder might have been a better choice for me and I've already ordered one.I like the blade shape but the handles are too thick and it's not easy to open it one-handed, I'm going to round out the edges of the finger grooves a bit more, that may help.Safety concern: there is a notch on the back of the blade that stops it halfway (but doesn't lock) when opening or closing the knife, preventing it from moving smoothly and possibly making it unsafe to handle one-handed, not sure if that can be ground down easily."
3,not the best,This DVD is a okay compare to other ones my daughter have (she is 2 1/2 year old). It quite boring actually. Don't buy it if your child already know how the alphabet and counting 1-10.
4,Interesting - kept you attention,"I like Stuart Woods - this book was a bit different for him, but I did enjoy it. He incorporated a character from another book which was interesting.Kept you interested enough to keep going and not put it down.I would reccommend the book, but it's not a best seller"
3,woods earlier works are his best,"Somehow I had missed reading this one year's ago. I loved Palindrome and Chiefs, but this one was a bit long. Too much description that took away from the story. However, much better than the Stone Barrington novels he is churning out these days."
3,Huge Stuart Woods fan,"Have read all Stuarts books, most were page turners.. this one.. not so much. Looking forward to something more exciting."
3,Could have moved along faster.,In as many books as he has wriitten about a variety of characters--He is bound to have a okay book once in while
3,interesting background for an important future character,very convoluted story which has some carry-over interest for following novels in the barrington series. President will lee has more solidity.
4,Great Book,Very good introduction to the young Will Lee. Sets the stage for his personality and what drives him. The story itself was excellent.
5,My New Favorite Stuart Woods Book!,"To really appreciate Run Before the Wind, you have to read Mr. Woods Memior, Blue Water Green Skipper first. He has taken a great deal of what took place during (and before)the 1976 OSTAR race and turned in into a stunning novel. I found myself unable and unwilling to put it down.I admire Mr. Woods ability to put some of these more difficult events into such a gripping novel and wonder if maybe it had a cathartic effect for him. I had previously been a devoted Stone Barrington fan, but since reading many of his backlist, I am now an enthusiastic Stuart Woods fan!"
4,Run Before the Wind,"""Run Before the Wind"" is part suspense novel and part adventure. Will Lee (a character also in ""Grass Roots"" and ""The Run"") is in Ireland to help Brits Mark and Annie Pemberton-Robinson build a boat that will sail in the race from England to Newport, RI. Mark's venture is funded by the mysterious Derek Thrasher. Robinson is hated by the IRA and there is a plot to kill him. This is one of Woods' earlier novels, and the writing is very clear, and ""Run Before the Wind"" is a very good book."
2,"Not a suspenseful, can't put down this book!","Run Before the Wind was the second book in the Lee series. At this time, Will Lee IV is in law school and not doing well scholarly. He decides to take a year off and travel England and Ireland. In the course of his travels, he meets up with a couple who sail and are in the process of building a boat for a reclusive businessman. He joins them on their adventure which includes problems with terrorist. I was disappointed in this book. It's not the suspenseful, can't put down this book that most of Woods work is, and the book is more of a disappointment after reading Chiefs, the first book in the Lee series."
1,310 pages of YAWNS,"Woods style kept me reading until the lukewarm end...Now, I regret not only what I paid for this ""thing "" but also the lost time I invested in this awful book"
3,"Very good music, but the production values are minimal","This is a fascinating listen for serious John Coltrane lovers, and you can't beat the price. However, the second song (Brazilia) is, in fact, an edited version of the third track. And the first notes of ""I Want to Talk About You"" are cracked, warbly, and harsh, making me nearly regret my purchase at first. But John and the band do a wonderful version of the song, and the sound quality isn't awful- better than, say, the Monk/Coltrane Live album, but not a sonic masterpiece like Live at Birdland. Not an essential album, but a nice discovery for the Trane fan."
5,wonderful rhythm and illustrations,"My whole family loves this book. The rhythm of the rhymes is very soothing. I like that specific species of birds or trees, for example, are mentioned and reflected accurately in the illustrations."
5,This CD is the best I recomend you buy it!!!!!!,"This cd is realy cool. Misha Shifutinsky is realy good. I remeber my mom playing his songs, I thought they were bad but now after listenning to him i realized what a great singer he was. Buy this cd if your Russian, you'll understand the words and they are fun. It is fun to listen to Misha, his song tell like a story."
5,Russian,The one who thinks that this CD is not worth buying it does not have even a little clue about Russia in general. This CD is one of the most loved CD's by russian people. Here is Shufutinsky at his best. Plus he is one of the most loved singers of Russia
1,Tasteless banter,Absolutely the worst part of the Russian culture - equivalent of the U.S. rap and gang music. Stay away from it.
5,this junx is CrrrrRRAaaaZZzzYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,------>>> absolutely dumbfounded over this album <<<------- some of the PhaTtest beats you've EVER laid your ears on with CRuciaL smooth rhymes that hail from the UnParaLLeLed StyLez that beatnuts can only provide .. ALL HIP HOP HEADZ MUST BUY THIS.. sounds SOOOO good.. it's freakin unbelievable.. it's aLLLL about da NuTS!!!!!! truly.
4,BEATNUTS NEW JOINT!!!!!,"BEATNUTS NEW ALBUM ""TAKE IT OR SQUEEZE IT"" IS PRETTY TIGHT. JUJU AND PHYCO LES LAY DOWN SOME ILL BEATS LIKE ALWAYS. THEIR LYRICS ARE TIGHT ALSO, BUT LACK KNOWLEDGE AND JEWLZ FOR YOUR DOME. I ALWAYS LIKED THE NUTS MOSTLY FOR THIER PRODUCTION SKILLS WHICH SHOW OUT AGAIN ON THIS JOINT, BUT THEIR LAST ALBUM ""MUSICAL MASSACURE"" WAS COMPLETE WITH BEATS AND ILL LYRICS WITH JEWLZ FOR YOU. I LIKED THEIR LAST ALBUM BETTER. IT HAD MORE BANGERS ON IT. STILL THIS NEW JOINT IS ILL. MY FAVORITE JOINTS ARE OF COURSE ""NO ESCAPING THIS"" (STRIGHTBANGER). ""HAMMER TIME"" (HOT JOINT) ""U DON'T WANT IT"", ""IF IT AIN'T GANSTA"", ""WHO'S COMMIN WIT THAT S**T NA"", ""SE ACABO REMIX"" WITH METHOD MAN. NOT ONE OF THE BEST HIP HOP ALBUMS THIS YEAR, BUT BETTER THEN ANYTHING ROCCAFELLA RUFF RIDERS WILL COME OUT WITH. IF YOU LIKE ILL BEATS PICK THIS JOINT UP."
1,I'm handicapped and I love this album...,"I may be considered mentally handicapped to some. But it doesn't mean I don't love music and rap music. And if there is any group bumping in my stereo right now it is BeatNutz ""Squeeze it hard"". I love this album so much and I listen to it a lot. At least 3 times a day. SOmetimes many times in the rows. I like the song they sing about girls. The album sounds so cool. It's so good. It's number 1! So I give it #1 star!!!"
2,Just Okay...,"Easy ordering, fast delivery. The product wasn't what I thought. I thought the pretzel was filled with garlic and cheese (sort of like the product Combos), but it was seasoned with garlic and cheese flavor (which was too salty)."
3,"good, but I have OD(over dosed) on them",This is great if you will share it with at lesst 3 or 4 people but not for 1.15 is too many for me. I am forcing my self to eat them.
3,Nicely-sized remedy for a snack attack,"I like the flavors chosen by the Pretzel Pete manufacturer, and the added little surprise of a little dollop of peanut butter treasured within the pretzel is a smile-maker.What irks me a bit, though, is that the nuggets themselves (in this shipment at least) approached ""too hard"", even ""like crunching on a rock"".Maybe that's why the small bags are so much appreciated -- they make the work to snag that peanut butter hidden treasure more palatable. I know my teeth think so."
2,Way too salty to be nutritious!,"These pretzels are very tasty and not hard little rocks like some pretzels are but they are WAY too salty. One package actually lasts me a week to ten days because I can only tolerate a certain level of salt in my diet and so..... by day 10, they are tasting a bit on the stale side and therefore quite unappetizing. I wonder why they have to be manufactured with sooooo much salt? If you like and can tolerate a high salt diet....these will be great for you since they really are very tasty. Try them and see what you think!"
5,wonderful,I have ordered these twice-everyone who has tried them loves them and the size bag is very convenient to take along when you go out.
3,Not so spicy hot any longer,"I've been enjoying Pretzel Pete's Sour Cream Spicy Hot pretzels for several years, and I have to say that they've changed the formula within the past year or so. They used to have a real spicy tang to them, befitting the use of the word ""habanero"" in their name. But lately, and I mean within the last two boxes of 12 bags I've purchased from Amazon, they've cut back on the spicy leaving a rather bland sour cream-flavored pretzel. There used to be a streak of green-colored spice along the cleft in the long side, but the vast majority of the individual pretzel bites lack this flavoring now. Cost cutting? Catering to the boring blandness of the average palate? Who knows. I do know that I probably won't be buying them again."
3,"Messy, Salty, Filling",Nice flavor but on the salty side. Very messy - not for working on the computer! My kids don't like them. They are very filling.
2,kindle version,"For those wanting the Kindle version . . . this does not have a TOC. For such a large work, one would think a TOC would be a given."
1,Disappointing,"If one is to pay for a Kindle Book, it should be formatted and indexed. This book is not. The content is great, but the formatting horrible."
1,not like it use to be,This snake in a can was nothing like they use to be. First of all the can did not even rattle like it had nuts in it and second when you opened the can the snake did not even jump completely out of the can and third the snake was plastic paper stuff.It was so bad I did not even give it to my six year old nephew I had to go buy something else. I would not recommend this item.
1,Not what I expected,I ordered this item and was very dissappointed when I received it and opened it because I expected like a snake to jump out of the tin and it was nothing like that but just this annoying sound coming out slowly
1,didn't expect a cheap plastic...,"didn't expect a cheap plastic version of what was billed as the ""classic"" can. the original was a real metal can, which rattled, with snakes that jumped out. This one looks like kids plastic food toy, doesn't rattle when closed, has a smallish snake that sticks it's head out rather then boing out of the can at the opener. very cheap imitation of the classic prank. I would have been fine buying this version -- but the seller should not have led me to expect something better. false advertising - fraud."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,The graphics lead you to believe there is going to be a significant snake flying out of CAN when you open lid. This is not the case. A very disappointing squeaky worm!
1,"Not what was pictured, want a REFUND","Usually when I buy something, I like to get what is actually advertised. What was sent to me was NOT what was pictured, plus the package was already opened and in bad shape when I took it out of the envelope it was mailed in. Had I read these comments before I purchased the item, I would have never bought it. Please provide me with a postage paid return shipping label so I can return this item for a refund.Much like many other comments here, the snake is different from what is advertised and only slowly springs out and only about half way. This a poor product, that was obviously already used by someone, and I would like a refund. Thank you."
1,Dont waste your time!,"I was expecting a CLOTH snake in a can as pictured not a plastic piece of trash! the snake is all plastic with a yellow head. It makes a ""dog toy"" squeak when the snake comes out.Plus the lid is very difficult to open. I should have read the online reviews before i pressed my buy button. My son, who is 2, played with it for maybe 5 mins and was bored with it! Im glad it was only 3.00 or i would be returning it. Please dont waste your money, even if it is 3.00. Its not worth it."
1,Snake in upside down can,"Don't waste your time on this snake nut in a can. I bought it as a goof for someone at work, and couldn't even use it the label was on the can upside down and it really does not look like a real nut can at all. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money."
3,Dont waste your money,"This turned out to be not at all what is advertised. Was looking for snakes that really pop out of can, all this does is rise a bit and squeek. Disappointed in the product."
1,CRAP!,"This didn't pop out at you or scare you at out like a normal ""pop out snake toy"" is supposed to. It was slow and just plan stupid. Don't order this crap. Totally worthless."
4,Classic Prank,"This product is good if you are using it for the purpose of just getting a prank gift. It's very cheap and cheap looking. But the use of it for surprising someone for the classic prank of a snake popping out of a can. Do not buy this item if you want a genuine gift. But for the price, it's worth it."
2,Don't Buy,This stuff doesn't hold up to heat better than any other Loctite I have used. I've had Blue Loctite that held up as well. Doen't waste you money.
1,What a waste of time !,"Erotic Ghost Story: Perfect MatchIf you are ever thinking of buying this DVD, my advice to you is :""Don't even bother !"". It is not worth the money spent and the actresses and actors are all so ""wooden"". Apart from showing off some Asian girls and their well toned bodies, the story-line is bordering on the most ridiculous and the ending is so abrupt. And where is Amy Yip as advertised in the product description ? In the DVD, there is a ""Diana"" but no Amy Yip and her infamous assets. What a big let down !"
2,Mildy erotic fairy-tale,"Lifeless plot, with little in the way of erotic charge. No sexual tension, just a sequence of lustful encounters."
5,Fabulous and fascinating book!,"I gave this book to my husband, as we were on our way to Switzerland and he loves military history. He had a hard time putting the book down, and read a number of excerpts to me during our trip. Even though I bought it for him, I feel as though I've read it also, due to the number of times he said: ""Let me read this section to you""! He commented that he now wants to read all of the other books by John McPhee, so I now have books to add to his gift list!"
2,product new?,I have worn this perfume for over 20 years and it is difficult to find in department stores. I ordered this in December and I immediately wondered how fresh the bottle was when I opened it. The perfume smells old to me. A lesson learned to probably only buy it from a reputable store like Saks Fifth Avenue.
4,Quelques Fleurs,"This is a gorgeous and full fragrance that plays beautifully on the skin. I have tried both the parfume an the eau de parfume and both are lovely, though i found the eau de parfume lasts a bit longer than the parfume. Of course, a lot of perfume preference is personal taste, but the classic elegance of this fragrance is one that a woman could wear for her whole life. Enjoy!"
2,"More like ""Horse-crazy People""","This book is wonderful if you're looking for photography of people's interaction with horses. I have to admit that I mistakingly bought this book thinking is was going to ""just"" be horses. True, it is about horses, but all the images are of the people from across the U.S. who care for them. Some chapter examples include Living with Horses, Working Horses, and The Competitive Horse. These are images of the millions of boys and girls, men and women across the world that cannot imagine life with out horses. I would not recommend for people looking for horse photography books by authors such as Robert Vavra, Gabrielle Boiselle, Tony Stromberg, and Bob Langrish."
1,This is a very poor song and the songs with it are even wors,"Joining You is one of the worst songs on SFIJ. The acoustic version is no better and These are the Thoughts and London are absolutely horrible. What a disgrace. Alanis, why did you release this???"
4,we need a english dubbed version region 1,i would like to see this movie in the english dubbed version. we miss the movie reading the subtitles...
1,All the Drowned Sailors,"This may be the most poorly written historic non-fiction book I have ever read. It's amazing that any publisher would agree to print this dull rehash of a subject covered so much more successfully before and since, including a national best seller."
2,Doesn't work with T10 as advertised,"The packaging explicitly states that it works with the Samsung T10 as well as the T9, but all I can get it to do is charge the T10. I have no way of knowing how it works with the T9, so if that's what you have ignore this review."
2,Not what I thought,"The product didn't work the way that I thought that it would. It is very easy to use and set up but the reception in my area isn't that great. I live in a very large city and are unable to get a very weak signal in my area for this device to run on. In the middle of a song, it can go in and out due to the changing of the frequencies. I wouldn't recommend spending the money. I would rather buy the cd and know that it will come in clearly."
2,"A great product, but not made for a city",This product works fine and is easy to use. I live in a city and their is no empty signals. There is static and bleed through from other radio stations.
1,Lots of Static,I can't seem to find the right channel to make this product work without static. I never have clear sound coming from my radio.
3,BELKIN TUNECAST AUTO REVIEW,"WASN'T SURE WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN I ORDERED THIS BUT IT WASN'T TOO EXPENSIVE. THE 12 VOLT PLUG DID NOT WORK CORRECTLY IN ONE OF MY CARS, NOT BECAUSE IT OR MY CAR'S POWER SOCKET WAS BROKEN; THE PLUGS CONTACTS WERE NOT MAKING CONTACT IN MY MAZDA'S POWER SOCKET BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE PLUG WAS DESIGNED. ALTHOUGH IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE ""UNIVERSAL"" IT MAY NOT WORK IN ALL CARS POWER SOCKETS. ALSO THIS PRODUCT PLAYS THROUGH YOUR RADIO ON AN FM FREQUENCY AND IT NEEDS TO BE TUNED IN TO A FREQUENCY THAT HAS NOTHING BROADCAST ON IT (STEADY ""STATIC"" NOISE). UNFORTUNEATELY I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE ALMOST EVERY SINGLE FREQUENCY IS BEING USED OR HAS SOME BLEED-OVER FROM ADJACENT FREQUENCIES. I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED BUT UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES IT DOES WORK O.K."
3,"Excellent Instruction, but very dated technology","Judy Byers' instruction and guidance on creating marketable spoken word audio is excellent. She concentrates on the development, marketing, nuts and bolts of producing profitable audio programs. Great information!Unfortunately, the book is highly focused on Cassette Tape production, and pooh poohs CD audio production as expensive and unlikely to surpass cassettes.From the book:""A minority of customers currently request spoke word CD's.""""I suspect different technology will replace audio CD's long before consumers will give up low-cost, easily accessible and convenient cassettes""HUH???This book should have been updated with the reality of CD and digital technology which has clearly surpassed cassettes by a LONG shot. However, if you can ignore her tech ignorance, the rest of the book is worth the price."
5,A must-read if you want to enter the audio publishing arena,"I received the book on a Friday and could not put it down until I finished it on Monday; cover to cover. It was the most information on the audiobook industry that I have found in one place since I began my research 6 months ago. Actually, it contains more information than all the other resources I have been able to locate combined. I especially like the Resources Section at the end of each chapter. It is a wonderful reference for neophytes like myself. It clearly presented the publishing process as well as the obstacles that a start-up audio publisher will encounter. Although the focus seemed to be toward the self-publisher, it was still extremely informative for me as a future (hopefully!) publisher of fiction written by others."
2,Very Cheap looking product,"This item was only $10.00 when I purchased it. There was a reason for that, because it looks like it cost less than that. This is a very cheaply made product. Remember the saying "" you get what you pay for"" well it certainly applies to this product. It is as seller reports it to be, just very cheaply made."
1,DeadHouse,"Extremely low budget, terrible acting, everywhere the characters go, it has a yellow tint in the camera. Not only that but before turning it off about 5 mins in, I realized that the beginning credits were done in windows movie maker with that generic fading text tool."
4,Another great Johnnie To film,"This movie pays homage to many of the classic gangter/1930's crime films made in the USA in the past 40 years. When you watch this you can't help but be reminded of ""The Sting"", The first two Godfather films and Once Upon a Time in America. I'd even put it above Leone's film in that it knows where to cut out the unnecessary; which can be a problem in some Hong Kong films. Andy Lau steals the screen once again, and if you haven't seen him in Infernal Affairs 1 & 3, get it now before Scorcese releases his remake. Leslie Cheung also had played the drama and action into his already complicated character with pure professionalism.The story is great, better than most of the crime films released in the US in the past 5 years, and the film is cut to leave you forced to rewatch the film to catch the subtleties that you missed the first time through."
3,Forgettable,"Good acting, scenery and creating the general mood of the period, but, the story itself was not as earth-shatteringly memorable as was advertised. Typical mobster fare. Lot's ofcoolness and cold-blooded killing. I kept waiting for the deep story that was supposed to be so ""electrifying,"" but it never developed. I wish I had rented this one. I did watch it all the way through but it didn't it didn't leave me particularly stirred."
5,"Stunning, Awesome, For Fathers and Sons, Just a great movie","I just saw this movie for the first time and I was blown away. This movie is really awesome. Tom Hanks plays his character so well. And so does the kid! And Paul Newman is great as the Godfather type, and he delivered one of the most insanely moving and true lines I have ever heard: ""Open your eyes! This is what we do, and there's only one guarantee, none of us will see heaven."" Okay I don't remember the exact quote off the top of my head but it was just awesome. Directing was also great. Mendes is a genius. One of the last scenes in the movie where Hanks is blowing all of the gangsters away while it was raining and he was far away, I will never forget that sequence. It was stunning. I was like OMG, that's awesome! This will easily go on my top 10 of greatest movies ever made. Spectacualar!"
3,Great mood in this one!,"I think the appeal here is that I've seen the graphic novel of this movie, and I like Tom Hanks. The mood was a little retro, a little dark, and Hanks definitely knows how to put some emotion and sympathy into a performance. If you like dark stories, or even if you just like Hanks, give this one a try."
1,"Americanized ""Lone Wolf and the Cub""","""A new Mafia movie""? Hmmm... How about a remake of a Japanese samurai epic. Has anybody seen the TV series ""Lone Wolf and the Cub"" or read the comic books? I dare say most who have seen the original will agree the TV series was way better, in all ways."
2,Pacing and Miscasting hurt this film.,"I was enthusiastic about seeing this film. The cast and story really held a lot of promise, and reviews I had read up to that point were promising.While it was a text book 'good film,' I just couldn't buy Tom Hanks as an assassin. I certainly don't fault Hanks for this, but the way the character was written, I didn't see much opportunity to develop that aspect of a redemptive-cold blooded killer. If this premise doesn't work for the main character, suspending disbelief for the rest of the film is a little difficult as well.And the pacing. While it's not a lightening-charged piece of entertainment, the pace is slow and methodical. But sometimes it gets so slow that your mind is given ample opportunity to wander. A well-constructed film doesn't give you the chance to do that. I felt this could have easily lost 30 minutes and been better for it.I can't give this a hearty recommendation, but if you insist, it's not a bad film."
3,Yee....ah,"When Newman last played an Irish-American (Frank Galvin in 'The Verdict') it was done with something close to grace and understatement. This thing is like an Irish version of The Godfather. From the opening 'wake' scene, replete with every Irish cliche possible (""When we lose one of our own, it hurts us all"", Newman brogues), one senses that what lies ahead will lack Coppola's particular finesse, as indeed it does. What ensues is an entirely mundane series of events, done before and done to death. I doubt that even the most ardent Hanks fan will buy him as 'Michael Sullivan', which further suggests the question of miscasting. Newman is crisply professional - as Newman always is - but this film was the wrong vehicle for two such towering talents. Jude Law shows up as a necrophiliac photographer. He looked better on the Italian riviera with Matt Damon."
5,"Gorgeous Imagery, haunting soundtrack, solid cast","It's all so f*cking hysterical.A cinematic triumph here. Not the most action packed of the ganster genre, but one of the most beautiful to watch since Miller's Crossing. I think the younger crowd will not appreciate it as much as the over age 25 film buff would.Set in the 1930's, The story is slow to begin, but eventually you are sucked into the plot and the characters. I think it's a great addition to my DVD collection, and more so on widescreen than the fullscreen that I rented, which was my first viewing of the film.It is one I shall watch again at least once a year."
4,Very well done,"Great casting makes for great movie. Set back into the 30's, Michael Sullivan(Tom Hanks) is a cold blooded murderer, hitman, but also a loving father and loyal husband. He must save his son, Michael, from not continuing in this business. Some twists in it and nice fighting scenes, and a brief appearence from Harry Groener(The Mayor on Buffy, About Shmidt, appeared on Star Trek(don't know which, obviously not a fan)) as Mr. Mcdougal. He really brought alot of joy to the screen like he did on Buffy, too bad he couldn't have been in it more. Tom Hanks can act, which is something I learnt. Here's my review:Plot: 4/5 Much different then your average movie these days, father protects his son from being a hitman.Acting: 5/5 Great acting from Hanks, Newman, Jude Law and Harry Groener. Not a problem in this movie.Characters: 4.5/5 Nothing special, just a hitman.Cheapness: 4.5/5 Not too cheap, very well done.Overall: 4.5/5 Great movie, see it."
4,Beautiful period piece,"The acting in this movie, both by Tom Hanks and the young man who played his son, were splendid. Paul Newman, who never seems to grow any older, just whiter, also played his part well. Being from the same time era that the movie took place in, I can tell you that the scenes, autos and clothing were all authentic appearing. (Didn't they always looked so overdressed compared to today?)The only negative: one could certainly believe that gangster assains were just good family men who went home most nights. It could be said to glamorize a person who in real life would probably have been a pschopathAll in all, n excellent movie!"
5,Wonderful movie!,"We enjoy this movie greatly. It is one of the few movies we can see more than once and still get more out of it. Definitely one to own instead of rent.My son is 11, which is a little young to watch this. It is graffic with violence. But he also sees the ""bigger picture"" of gang warfare during the prohibition. And to be honest, he sees the horrors of guns in this."
3,"Well acted, well shot... but...","This was a very well acted film with a strong cast. The film has some great visuals and sound as well. However, the story plods along a bit, and is fairly predictable. It is a pretty dark and depressing film, and so there are those that will automatically brand it as 'deep' because of that. I thought it was an ok film but it wouldn't of been memorable at all if it wasn't for the cast. Rent it if you must, but I'm not sure it is worth owning."
2,Rambo in a trenchcoat,"Film is obviously a great seducer with the ability to create dramatic effect with all the great cinematic effects and music, not to mention the faces we've all come to love. This movie has plenty of all that. Some of the scenes are really gorgeous to look at. But the film ultimately rings hollow, offering no deeper insights into the violent nature of man as its' effects are continually smeared across the screen. Paul Newman's character, at one point, says, ""These are the lives we choose"" but rather than using this as a stepping stone into meditations on this potentially profound theme, it comes at the end, and in the next scene machines guns are being cocked. Trying to mimic reality a little more than a film treading similar ground, Rambo, here our protaganist dies. (Shucks, no part II.)"
2,Ok movie to fall asleep to,"I must be the only person who was bored out of my mind watching this movie.It is a great cast and the acting is great. The plot, about a mafia-father who has to take his son and run for their lives after his wife and other son are killed by one of his ""partners"", is a good plot.But, after the first 15 minutes I was so bored I was ready to turn the movie off and my husband was fast asleep.Everyone I've talked to says the same thing, but obviously none of them have written a review here."
4,Why a different end than the book?,"I loved the movie, I thought iy was visually stunning and well acted. I picked up the original book after seeing the movie, and was suprised to find out the ending of the novel was so much more poignant. Was the director more concerned with commercial appeal?I understand some of the changes, as they were made for time, streamlining and condensing. Easier to have one hitmanetc... but why change the end, why deviate form the book there? The ending seemed predictable but at the end of such a well crafted movie I was not disapointed, but after reading the novel, by comparrison the movie's end seems to lack the impact of the novel's. The director played it safe."
4,Tom Hanks pulled it off.,"I was a little skeptical at first about Tom Hanks playing a gangster, but he did a very good job of doing so. When I popped this DVD in my player, I really didn't know what to expect, I haven't heard anything about the movie, all I knew was that I am a pretty big Tom Hanks fan (beside Cast Away). The movie is about a gangster (Tom Hanks) and his son that are on the road for six weeks running from the people that killed their family and at the same time trying to get revenge on the people that killed their family. At the climax of the movie I couldn't help but wonder why I ever doubted it, it was terrific. A must watch."
4,Unexpectedly moving climax ...,"Serious, intense, moody gangster drama set in the 1930s, with Hanks as quiet hit man Mike Sullivan who must go on the lam with his one surviving son, after his wife and other son are murdered (an unfortuanate scene, but it sets the story in motion). A few twists make it slightly more intelligent than most genre films of this type, and the period, acting, and characters are vivid and believable. Leigh has a thankless role, but Law is chilling as a murderous photographer. The script adaptation by David Self (while it alters Max Allan Collins original script for the excellent graphic novel upon which this film is based) is fine. Mendes handles the gangster film with taste and style, and in the midst of all the bloodshed there is actual humanity. The film is rated R for shock violence and profanity."
3,good and yet,"The visuals are beautiful, the acting is wonderful, the music and sound are stunning, and yet I feel like it did not live up to it's full potential. Tom Hanks is better than he demonstrated in this film, and the script seemed to suffer from a lack of interesting dialogue."
3,O.K. but it doesn't change your life,"I just saw this movie and i can say that it was a GOOD movie , but nothing more...Way benneath American Beauty , this movie has great photography, as expected, great acting, as expexcted. The music, though, is rather mediocre, and the plot lacks in substance. I mean this movie doesn't have a meaning, a deep one, it's only about showing off good skills in making cinema. Sorry, Sam Mendes, without Alan Ball it's tough out there..."
2,Something went very wrong here.,"Fascinating scenario, wonderful screenplay, some marvelous performances and beautiful to look at. So, why didn't I love this movie? I'm not certain. There was a sense of something ""false"" throughout every frame which I remain unable to put my finger on. This bothers me.I hate to call something a turkey, but this movie - which seemingly has most of the elements of a great picture - fails to pull them together into a cohesive whole. Here, we must blame the director. There are, to be sure, some wonderfully riveting performances by an almost uniformly excellent cast, but these performances feel like they belong in another, more deserving, and ultimately better movie."
1,BOR-ing!,This has to be the most boring movie I have ever sat through in my entire life. There doesn't seem to be much point to it. All they do is shoot at each other. What a waste!
2,BORING MOVIE,"This is a very bad movie. I can't seem to figure out whether the script or the directing is what lacks but it's defintely a bad melodramatic movie. The cinematography is good, and of course so is Tom Hanks but there's not much to it really. I personally found it very boring."
5,Toms Hanks Has done it again-Ben N. At The Movies,"Tom Hanks is in my opinion one of the best actors alive he has outstanding performances that make you smile, cry, or simply laugh, this movie was grand Paul Newman played a really great supporting actor as Mr. Rooney and Jude Law did okay at playing his part over well this movie is good a drama thats not worth missing has alot of action as well mixed into it"
3,A revenge movie,"The story reminded us a lot of the many westerns of the 1940s and 50s in which the murder of the wife and child had to be avenged by the rancher. We give it 3 stars for its technical excellence (sets, costumes, sound, etc) only."
2,Disappointing Plot,"As fans of both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, my husband and I were both disappointed by this film. There is nothing wrong with the acting, or the cinematography, but the plot leaves something to be desired. Both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman acted their parts well. There is a lot of several hit men chasing each other around, and a lot of killing, but very little to the plot or story. If you really enjoy the 1930's Mobster Era, you will probably like this film. If, like me, you don't enjoy that era, try another Tom Hanks film."

1,ROAD TO PERDITION,"I just so Happen to love this movie and when I recieved this product I was excited to watch it. The only problem is that half way through the DVD skipped and I was unable to watch the remainder of this movie. All in all, GREAT movie but the DVD itself did not work..."
3,Terrible movie to watch. Fine performance by Tyler Hoechlin,"No! This definately is not another Bob Hope/Bing Crosby Road picture. I was very disappointed by this Tom Hanks/Paul Newman movie. I will say that Tyler Hoechlin did a fine performance and I hope we will see him in other films as he becomes mature as an actor. It was good to see Paul Newman in a movie again even though he does play a ""heavy"". Seeing Tom Hanks as a ""heavy""/father sends chills up my spine, however one of his early films, he did play a murderer. It was a terrible movie to watch, but it did hold my interest. The DVD contains many deleted scenes which I thought some should have been included in the film. Many scenes with Jennifer Jason Leigh were cut out. Interesting production notes. Best to watch this film in the standard version.Tyler Hoechlin went on to be a regular in the tv series, ""7th Heaven"" (1996-2007) as ""Martin Brewer"" from 2003-07. Recently in Hall Pass (2011) and is in the MTV tv series, Teen Wolf."
2,Pathetic Gangster Style Movie,"I've read a lot of reviews for this movie stating that it is an excellent film and some even call it one of the best movies of all time. I couldn't disagree more. I found this film to be a disappointment. Tom Hanks & period-gangster style films just don't go together. When I see Tom Hanks, I see him in Big.. not as a serious actor. In ""Road To Perdition"" Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a born and bred gangster in the 1930's, who is forced to abandon his lifestyle when his wife and one of his sons are killed and he is forced to protect the elder son, a witness of a killing. The story does leave something to be desired. Predictable and hackneyed plot, with pretty weak story development. I'm a big fan of movies like the Godfather & Goodfellas but this one just plain stinks."
2,Saw it twenty years ago...,"I am a huge fan of Hanks, Law, Newman, Leigh, etc. They were all great in this movie. However, I was very disappointed in the screenplay itself. It was said to be based on a DC comic novel but it was a ripoff of an early seventies Japanese series Lone Wolf and Cub...or maybe DC stole the idea first. Even much the cinematography were taken from Lone Wolf but set in the US. It's not a bad movie but save your money and watch the better version, rent the original."
3,Having A Go With Us,"""Road to Perdition"" isn't a terrible film and not as boring as some ADD kids might have you believe. There really are some beautiful scenes and great acting, but some truly confusing/laughable scenes. Father and son bonding scenes always confuse me. Why is it they always bond by learning how to drive stick? After ""Over The Top"", viewers stopped caring.Shortly after this scene there is a strange montage sequence to a wacky ragtime ditty. These uncanny moments would be overlooked, but it's directly after some truly awful events.Suppose they couldn't get Robin Williams for the deep-dish pizza scene. Ho hum, we've seen worse."
4,Road to Perdition - as viewed by LBlancke,"I know most of us are thinking its a pretty safe risk to spend [money]. ... on a flick starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. Road to Perdition is no exception. The story line reminded me of the movies of yesteryear. Just a strong story with strong actors. There were no flashy special effects, no hot sex or hard core language. Don't get me wrong the story revolves around a family of hit men, so the violence is everywhere but understated. Paul and Tom carry their understated personalities well. But for me the star was the young man who played Tom's son. Excellent acting! Excellent story! I'd like to see a sequel starting the young man (the son) as he makes decisions into manhood."
4,to the point,"This movie is a good crime thriller, some great actors and a plot that keeps you well into the movie itself. A movie about a young boy led to the dark side of human behavior by his father. All in all, a good flick."
2,tom hanks descends into hell -- not to mention bad movies,"the hype when this was released had this as one of the big movies of the year, but for once the public caught on and this silly thing has disappeared from consciousness. tom hanks continues the downward arc of his career, and paul newman is utterly unconvincing as the patriarch of a crime organization. what pretends to be a metaphor for the american family is little more than a 2 hour yawnfest; watch ""the godfather"" for the 27th time instead."
3,Paul Newman steals the movie but I'll read the graphic novel,"Tom Hanks as a gangster whose loyalty to his boss (Paul Newman) conflicts with his family? And what in the world was Jude Law doing at that diner? Probably got lost trying to make it back to Nicole Kidman in ""Cold Mountain"" and wandered from the 1860s to the 1930s.Tom Hanks isn't horrible as a gangster--at least he manages to be subdued and and solemn, even almost honorable about what he's doing rather than the much-lampooned gangster stereotype. Paul Newman's no Godfather, just a guy who makes his living as a criminal, and a respectable nicely polished well-spoken guy at that. The movie changes from an exploration of the 1930s Irish mob scene to a ""Road"" movie with father and son running for their lives. While putting kids in jeopardy always makes for a good story, it feels a little confused in this movie."
3,"Good, but could have been better","This movie is rather slowly paced, but largely makes up for it with excellent performances from most of the actors, a first rate musical score, and absolutely gorgeous locations and cinematography (the only movie I know of which visually represents the period as well or better is ""Miller's Crossing""). The only thing I am really disappointed with is the ending. I know the exact dramatic reasons that prompted the writer and director to make it the way they did, but the ending is all too predictable, and I really can't admire anyone who is too squeamish to try and defend himself from his own inevitable murder."
1,This movie was a dissapointment.,"This movie lacked character development. There was not a single character in the movie who I cared about. Yes, it was a heartless gangster movie, but at the same time the producer made no effort to develop empathy in any of the characters. Thus, when the sequences start showing different individuals being murdered, there was no pain, no sorrow. I was thinking, when is thos movie going to be over. My feeling is that this was an excellent story -- theoretically -- but when it came down to creating the movie, it looked differently in reality than it was when it was first thought up. That's unfortunate, of course, because there was a great deal of potential."
1,"Or, The Road to Pretension","Genuinely awful. A glop of pretentious falderal. Horribly directed, embarrassingly bad acting, a truly uninspired script. Beautiful cinematography does not a great movie make. One of the most overrated films of all time."
1,Huge disappointment,"I don't know where I got the idea that this was supposed to be a good movie...Lots of advertising hype? I love Tom Hanks, and I enjoy watching Jude Law's development, but this film is seriously bad. The plot is impeneterably confusing until it finally becomes clear that the Hanks character is trying to save his surviving son's life, and from then on it was a simple and predictable formula. The only thing remotely interesting here is the '30s mood, and even that was thin. A miserable yawn, literally: my husband and I actually fell asleep watching it."
1,Dark and Moody,"Whether or not Tom Hanks and Paul Newman fall into the great actors category for their roles in this film seems irrelevant when measuring the film's overall ability to entertain. Sadly, this 30s period piece involving murderous Irish gangsters flops miserably. The plot although reasonable is predictable from the moment the young son appears and begins his monologue against the backdrop of the roiling surf. Actually watching the trailer and drawing your own conclusions sufficiently will convey the film's complete content. Jude Law's lesser but equally grim appearance pushes the negative aspects of the plot to a dark precipice which no healthy mind wishes to go. This is no study of amorality like the much more entertaining and thought-provoking ""Talented Mr. Ripley"". This one makes you wish you hadn't bothered.Don't waste your time on a story and atmosphere that depresses rather than engages."
2,Tom Hanks is no Al Pacino (in Gangster Roles),"Although Road to Perdition is not a terrible movie, I feel that the entire movie suffers from a fatal flaw made before the first day of filming, and that's the casting of Tom Hanks as an organized crime hit man. Sorry, it just doesn't work. Hanks, although a brilliant actor, simply wasn't believable as a hit man. He's no menacing Al Pacino (The Godfather, Scarface), or even Gary Oldman (JFK, Sid and Nancy, Air Force One).Even if I could have gotten past Hanks as a hit man (I can't), there's the dark and brooding look to the film, which obscures a lot of the action. Another bad decision in the making of the film. Ultimately, it was kind of boring and a waste of time.This movie compares unfavorably to the much better crime genre movie ""Miller's Crossing"" by the Coen brothers. Now that's a good mob movie set in the 1930s, only done in a very artistic and entertaining way."
1,1 star is too much,This film had so much potential but it just didn't come across well enough to be believable.
5,Excellent,I seen this movie once in I was touched Ive never got it out of my mind if you havent seen it yet then you should it worth it Tom Hanks GREAT ACTOR.
5,some of the best!,"This is a great movie! Would highly recommend it to any one!If you liked good fellas, then you will love this movie, (specially in H D blu-ray)."
5,Beauty and filmammking at it's best!,"Road to Perdition is simply stunning with the acting and cinematography. While it does have to do with the genre of ""gangsters"", it is really a movie of a father and son. Mendes has done an enormous job of presenting everything in a slow, simple way that is acted out wonderfully. Everything is suble about the film, but yet everything is powerful and moving, with a lot of that being credited to not only that actors but Mendes editing and camera shots. Such is the case in the scene in the beginning of the film when Tyler Hoechlin's character sees his father from a distance getting ready for dinner. There is no dialogue but when you see the camera closeup of Tom Hanks getting out his gun and his son's wide eyes, the scene speaks for itself. Breathtaking, tremendous, it gives new life to the the stale gansgter movie!"
2,How to make a boring gangster movie...,"Not unlike many other movie fans who enjoyed American Beauty, I awaited the arrival of this film to theaters with great anticipation. For the hype it was getting (including comparisons to The Godfather!) I was expecting a fast moving, thought provoking gangster epic. Instead, I was subjected to the equivalent of a shot of nyquil. It put me to sleep and never tasted right. There were too many moments that should have been seen in this movie that were left to the imagination (anybody getting gunned down must dance with bullet impact, not be heard only!) Film is a visual medium for crying out loud! To the producers, director, actors, and hell even the authors of the graphic novel: it is not the audience's job to make your film interesting or even enjoyable. For the price of tickets is high, and there are other films to choose from.P.S. The Crow was a fluke, unless you're going to animate the feature. Leave the comics, err, graphic novels alone."
4,Road to Perdition,"I've read several negative reviews at this posting site and I find them hard to swallow. This film is good. It's not slow or perdictable in my view. IT may not rank up there with Casablanca, but it has plenty to offer. The book that it's based on has a different ending and several other differences from the film.I read the book first, and parts of the book I think are better. Having said that,the film did not disappoint."
4,Very good movie.,"It's a good movie but not a great movie. I think Road to perdition is getting overrated bigtime with comparisons to the godfather. The Godfather is moviemaking at it's greatist but road to perdition to me is very good and worth seeing but after all the hype about it was almost disapointing. All the acting was good in the movie. Tom Hanks of course play a excellent role but to me was not much compared to some of his other great roles like Forest Gump or Cast Away. His acting was good but not great. To me the biggest flaw in this movie was thier wasn't enough dialogue and that left me a little bord during the movie at times but not much. So overall if you want to see a godfather like movie classic you won't, but if you want to see a good well made movie you will."
2,Prep-School Imitation of John Woo,"This is a remake of The Lone Wolf and the Cub, and it borrows heavily from John Woo's Hong Kong gangster flicks - the male bonding, the shooting ups, the religious motifs... However, it is missing the intensity and passion, and Chow Yun-Fat. Tom Hanks just cannot fill Chow's shoes, and he appears uncomfortable trying to portray a ""family-oriented"" hitman.The original Japanese TV series, which has been remade into movies and other series several times in Asia, had much more heart and spirit."
2,dull gangster movie,"I went to see this having no idea what it was about... and found it dull, emotionally shallow, and highly predictable. It had none of the flair of The Untouchables or diligent detailing of The Godfather, the sets and locations were mediocre, and the lighting is pointlessly dark.It was in every way forgettable. I think too much has been made of Sam Mendes' direction of ths film (he's a fellow Brit, who commanded American Beauty magnificently, but not so here). The character development was wafer thin to the extent that you didn't really care who was killed. The plot was excruciatingly obvious.Hype is a dangerous thing when the goods are below 100%. Quad erat demonstratum."
3,Good movie,Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are fabulous actors but I wasn't deeply impressed by this picture. Jude Law is also a great actor. However I'm not a huge fan of violence. It is a great movie though.
3,Hype,"Tom Hanks as a hitman? I don't buy it -- and neither will you. Paul Newman's greatest performance? Nope. Overly-hyped, predictable Hollywood product? Yes."
2,An utterly predictable and ordinary mafia tale,"Although this movies does have beautiful cinematic images, the acting is less than motivating and Tom Hanks, the over-rated academy award dominater, does little to reach the audience. Also, Hanks just does not fit the profile of being a mafia gangster. He was much better in any of his other movies! Throughout the movie one can easily predict exacly what will happen. I heard one editorial say that this is the next great mafia movie since Goodfellas. No way is this in the slightest bit true! Goodfellas beat the hell out of this movie! However, if you don't specically care to see a great movie and you just want to kick back and see some great cinematic images then this movie might suite your desire. Overall it may be worth your time; however, this is no Oscar winner!"
2,Miscast & slow moving,"The title of my review sums this film up completely.Hanks as an assassin? Come on.And it dragged on for what seemed forever.If you enjoy ""mafia"" type films, this one falls into that category but it will leave you bored throughout."
4,Awesome!,I bought the full screen edition but still I really like this film and was surprised despite what the hardcore reviewers out there say. It has action and has story but first as a good film always starts is the relationships and the connections amongst the people of the community and what is occuring at the very moment due to actions and threatening revolution from the past. If you can't waith for Once Upon A Time In America to come out yet or already have the untouchables than you should look at this film cause it is a good one.
2,Below Mediocre,"I've read that this is a fairy tale gangster movie. That it is meant to be unrealistic. One review saw it as a modern epic. Well, I thought that it was a badly made movie. In a time when movies appeal to the masses and have to give people a happy ending, Road to Perdition fits in well. The story is unbeleivable and ridiculous. The character played by Hanks is flat and a charicature of what he is meant to be. The only character who appealed to me was the killer trying to track down Hanks and his child.If you liked the godfather, goodfellas, or the Sopranos, you will most likely find this movie to be ridiculous, simplistic and supar coated. I am upset that I paid to see this movie and added to it's success."
3,pretty good but predictable,the thought of having Tom Hanks&Paul Newman in the same Film is reason enough to create a huge buzz afterall they are a couple of the Greatest Actors Ever&whatnot.but while they each give Solid Performances here for a Gangster Film it's to Soft for my taste&the pacing&overall Writing Script is rather to tame&just there for a kinda long film with predictable Action.Newman&Hanks do really well even though this film is figured out by the first hour.
3,A home theater disappointment!,"I will leave the actual film review up to others. I was disappointed in the video quality. This film rates 3.5 stars for poor video compression. Objects in the background are often lost in noise. While I watch this on the big screen I was often distracted by blurry images. With an industry that pays so much attention to detail, why do they release products like this? I am sure this film would look fine for small or medium sized TV sets, but if you are viewing on a large screen, be warned.(I have seen better video, so why should I see worse)"
4,better than i expected,"i expected another too much singing long overly drawn out boring play but it was surprisingly good, i never would've thought Cole from Martin would be good at a serious role but he was and when i had my sister over thinking she may not like it, she did, so to each his own on opinions but it did get me to thinking about my life and times i've judged others and been wrong."
5,Spectacular Prokofiev!!!,"This disc is a winner in every way! The selections are great. Symphony No. 1 is one of Prkofiev's finest pieces of music. The famous 3rd movement, the Gavotta, is wonderful and performed with outstanding panache by Seiji Ozawa and the Berlin Philharmonic. The ever popular Love for Three Oranges is presented equally masterfully by Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony. The filler, Sni (Dreams), was unfamiliar to me, but it, too, is beautifully performed by Vladimir Ashkenazy and the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. The sound is brilliant and perfectly balanced. No matter what other Prokofiev selections you have in your collection, you certainly should rush to buy this great CD while it is still available and an outstanding bargain! Highly recommended."
3,It might be a good book for a mathematic student but not a good one for an engineering student.,"It might be a good book for a mathematic student but not a good one for an engineering student. There are too many mathematic jargons with very limited explanations. Many notations just take for granted that the readers have already known them. It is very hard for people who have limited math background. Moreover, there are so many editorial errors in the current version. I would suggest that the author put a mathematical symbol/sign index at the end of the book and make it easier for the readers to look for their meanings."
2,sizing is the problem,"The XX-Large sizing is a joke. I struggled to put this on my hound because it was so tight on him. It especially did not fit across his chest, which is XXL. Therefore, the sweater was returned immediately. I think the sizing should read XX-Large for a small dog. Amazon did a nice job with the return and refunding my money."
1,WAY to small,"Ordered this for my pit bull mix. The listed length and weight should have been fine, but I couldn't even get one paw in. Very tight through the shoulders and chest."
5,Excellent Basic Moisturiser,This is a basic moisturiser for very dry skin. No bells and whistles but works well. I use this after I use my Cellex-C serum
5,"Sing, Spell, Read, Write - EXCELLENT PROGRAM!!!!","I have used this program with various students for the past three years and have found it to produce the BEST/MOST EFFECTIVE reading progress for my students. The songs only reinforce student learning and make it fun for the kids. With even only 15 minutes a day, your child WILL learn how to read."
4,It works,"What can I say? It works! The lessons are a bit repetitive. Same activity, different letter. But my kids at 3 and 4 are more than a step ahead of the rest."
3,Cassette Tapes/VHS/ This needs to be updated!,"This is a good program BUT what am I suppose to do with an instructional VHS tape of 1hr and 9 minutes and 6 cassette tapes for kids. Seriously, for $250 there should be some sort of updating on this. I am so annoyed about the contents of this box right now. I have NO WAY to play these tapes or VHS tape and the side of the box was misleading when it said CD (this is ONLY for some songs that the kids sing). IF this was updated...then it would be great!"
4,Incorrect Readers,Love this curriculum can't say it enought!!! However the readers that correspond with On Track are not correct. There are many difference from the reader and the questions asked on the comprehension page in the book which is frustrating.
3,Helpful,"I used this when I first was looking for a place to rent. It was well-written and well organized. It touch on topics that I would never have thought of. But now that there are good resources on the internet, I think this book is now out of date."
5,Samurai Girl #5,"This book was awsome, just like the rest of the series. Its just so good that its addicting. There is alway something going on it never boring. I can't believe that Hiro would keep such a secret, Heaven needs to learn that everyone has there dark secrets from the past that they just want to forget."
2,Cryptic Portrait,"David Krell's avant-garde biography of the great philosopher is borderline incomprehensible as it is steeped in an impenetrable post-modern litany of obscurantist literary techniques. However, the novel is truly ambitious, as Krell attempts to tell the Nietzsche's story from the point of view of his late insanity. The result is extraordinarily unreadable and esoteric. Perhaps the one notable achievement of the work is that Krell has reproduced many of Nietzsche's original letters to friends and family and all of his medical documents recorded during his years in mental institutions. The reader is provided with a rich insight into the poor man's regression. Still, one is left with a broken storyline, undeveloped characters and scenarios, and prose that is entirely too derivative of Joyce's Ulysses."
1,who can read this stuff?,"How anyone finished this book is beyond me. Stream-of-consciousness modernism became a literary cliche many decades ago, but it still survives to provide swanky intellectual cover for authors like Krell, who are unable to tell a compelling story. The flouting of sexual taboo is another tedious literary cliche, yet Krell attempts to use it as his meal ticket, with ridiculous effect: see his speculations about young Nietzsche sitting on his father's lap during a piano lesson and feeling an erection in Daddy's pants. Is this ""novel"" vile or simply ludicrous? Don't waste your time or money trying to decide which."
5,THE SHOAH: THE PARADIGMATIC GENOCIDE,"Mr. Zev Garber, is an exacellent writer and teacher. I'm a student in his clss, and the way he teaches is beautiful. This book is the best book i have ever read. I advise all of you to read this book and learn the true facts about The Shoah."
5,This book is amazing!!,This book is definitely the best I've ever read! It captured the feelings so well and I could completely relate to every word of it. This book is for every teenage girl that ever wondered about life...I love it.
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!,"This has to be by far the best book I had ever read. I first came across a blurb from this book in a Seventeen magazine from Sept 2003 (I believe) and I had to buy the book. It's crazy that another human being feels/thinks/went thru the exact samething I did,and currently still struggling with. I carry a copy of this book with me in my bag. A line from the book is embedded in my head; ""If you brought 30 ppl right now who knew me they would say I'm a wonderful person. But thats all lie.""A wonderful written book, the author is a very talented person. Hope she is still writing!!"
5,How Did We Get Here?!,"I so enjoyed reading this book - not only was it educational and fascinating, almost like a detective story of how we got from the years when computers were just entering our consciousness, through the birth of the internet years to our world now, filled with games, CGI, movies with fantastical effects, smart phones, tablets and who knows what next.The creativity of the minds behind the innovations that led to and make our day-to-day world, the nets and connections of those individuals, is well laid out and inspiring. Whether you are young and curious, interested in movies or the worlds of Lucas, Coppola, Pixar and more - or just a history of the refinement and evolution of ""personal"" computers, I believe you will enjoy and learn from this book as I did. For me, it filled in all the gaps of what was going on behind the scenes in computers from when I graduated college in 1975.Just loved it!"
3,Droidmaker : questionable research,"I'm not too far along into this book, but I've already read that the Summer of Love ended with the concert at Woodstock, and that the US was just entering the Vietnam war in 1965. Both of these statements are wrong. The Woodstock concert took place in 1969, a full two years after the summer of love, and by 1965 the US was fully engaged in Vietnam. After all, the battle of the Ia Drang Valley (one of the biggest battles of the war) happened in November 1965.Apparently, given all the five star reviews this book has received, not too many others are concerned about these errors, but to me they cast doubt on the entire work. If a writer can get such easily verifiable facts as these wrong, how can I trust him to be right about the primary subject, which in this case I think would be much more difficult to get right?Droidmaker is a very well written book, and I was enjoying it until I came across these mistakes. Now I don't know if I'll bother finihing it.Steve"
5,Pizzazz Your Quilts,"Great idea book! I love the way the author shows you how to showcase fabric. If you bought a piece of fabric because you love it and don't want to cut it into little pieces, you can keep part of it intact and highlight it with nine-patch squares to create a lovely quilt with your favorite fabric highlighted by the your pieced design of coordinating fabric."
4,"Quick, easy and fun",I have completed one quilt using this technique and already have fabric set aside for the next one. The directions were easy to follow and the quilt turned out great!
2,Don't Bother,The idea for this one is simply to layout your nine-patch around your favorite large scale fabric. It was a waste of money in my opinion. Buy it used if you must.
4,Fun and flexible,"I am a beginning quilter and this book freed me to do my own thing. I used 3 plus wildlife panels and now have a wonderful wall hanging. I did not do it in a day but in two weeks I did cut, sew and quilt the wall hanging. Spectacular results for me! I highly recommend the book."
2,Terrible book!,"This book is too old, it has the the basic concepts and nothing else! It was a terrible resource to use for the biology GRE, I ended up voiding my score because I realized that this book didn't prepare me at all for the test!"
1,Not a good guide...,"I started off using this book, the Kaplan 2009-2010 edition, and my intro bio book to study for the Gre Bio, and very quickly realized that the Princeton Review book is utterly useless. It doesn't cover the material with enough depth (1.5 pages on digestion compared to 9 pages in the Kaplan). If you compare the material in the book with the checklist given by ETS, you'll also see that it doesn't fully match up. It is also riddled with mistakes. Save your money, go Kaplan for study guide + Intro Bio book for clearing up concepts here and there + wikipedia for alternative definition of certain terms. Good luck"
4,Explains clearly but doesn't include all subjects fully,"The book is easy to read and gives background information and a general review but does not cover all topics, although it did mention some subjects not included in the Kaplan book. I think if used with proper review material to expand on the subjects mentioned it is useful."
5,TRACK LIST,"When Javier Calderon played his solo recital debut at Carnegie Hall, the New York TImes called him ""a virtuoso with poetic sensibilty.""

2,Naturalistic Reduction of Sanctity to Sadomasochism,"I first watched the Vatican-approved version with Lindsey Younce in the starring role, and while I enjoyed the film as part of my growing admiration for Therese, I felt the film was too emotionally drawn and lacking depth.This film, evidently directed by an atheist, went to the other extreme...too artsy fartsy. And what's more, the director's atheism portrayed the saint as well as all the other nuns in the Carmel as deranged neurotics with a latent S&M; streak.I'm reading the writings of Therese and those who knew her. That's where you will find her spirit...not in this film."
1,An Insult to St. Therese,"I threw this movie in the trash after watching it and felt guilty for having given any time to it at all. It is a repulsive attack on the life of this holy woman. She is shown as mentally ill and secretly hating her Catholic faith. there is a scene where she drops a crucifix, steps on it and intentionally drags it along the floor under her foot...the directors attempt to somehow suggest her disrespect for Christ. There are many disturbing scenes which are based on the sick, anti-Catholic imagination of the director and not at all on any facts about St. Theresa's life. The only person who could enjoy such a film would have to have a similar hatred for Catholicism and be fond of these creepy, repulsive, so-called artsy movies. It taught me to do my research before buying a movie that I think might be edifying!"
1,An Awful Film about St. Therese,"I was not crazy about the American movie about St. Therese because I felt it portrayed the characters as too one-dimensional, and everything felt too airy fairy. However, after seeing this film, the American one now seems like a pure gem.This movie portrays St. Therese as a demented, neurotic, little creep. It portrays the monastic life as something that is dreary and rather depressing. It seems to me that the movie was based far more on the director's opinion of Catholic monasticism than on the actual life of St. Therese itself. For anybody interested in the actual life of St. Therese I recommend reading her autobiography, and avoiding this film at all costs!"
1,Unusual...Dark...Uninspirational,"The setting of this film was entirely on stage and thoroughly cinematic with a sense of darkness and lack of joy all throughout. It's not that the characters didn't express joy, it's just that I couldn't feel their joy from the way they expressed it. I found it to be at the utmost unusual, not in the least bit inspirational, and even scary to watch. I haven't read ""Story of a Soul"" (St. Therese's autobiography) but know about St. Therese's ""little way"". If I were to rely on this film alone, I would certainly have a misconstrued understanding.I've watched other films on saints, including ""Bernadette"", ""The Passion of Bernadette"", and ""St. Teresa of the Andes"", and found these films to be so much more inspirational."
1,Feeling Bulimic? This Will Help,I wanted to throw up while watching this film. What a horrible depiction of a saint's life - it is sacreligious and false. (One scene I find difficult to forget is Therese calling Christ the best lover she ever had.) I could not suffer through the entire film and it is NOT meant for a Catholic audience. I'm not even a religious person and this offended me. Another reviewer points out that the director is an atheist; it shows in his final product.
1,This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,"As if the low budget background wasn't enough, the movie jumps from scene to scene often leaving the viewer saying 'huh?' It is full of sexual innuendo, usually when you least expect it. The actor also depicts a sick form of thought when talking about being a bride of Christ. This actor gives it an infatuation that is enough to make anyone gag. Rather than showing a true charity emotion for Jesus Christ, the movie gives it a 'my boyfriend is cooler than yours' type of teenage approach that was simply sickening. The movie even goes further by humiliating people of the faith by 'bragging' about her prayer and how much good it did. This movie is a definite waste of time. [...]"
3,"Good for DMs, but not so much for players.","Stormwrack is a nice book about sea trade, pirates, and aqauatic adventures. It has a few bits of rather nice advice for those seeking to add an aquatic touch to their campaign or make a purely aquatic one. They have some of the best rules for boats (as far as I'm concerned) out of any d20 book.That being said, this book is really only about oceans, and is most useful to DMs. Players won't get much out of it unless they know they're going to be playing in waterbased campaigns for a long time."
5,"Different, but very good","Normally I do not like remakes of songs, but Talisman has a nack of pulling it off. They do a remake of Queen, Prince and Madonna. At first I said No Way! Then, the Talisman fan that I am, I started to listen to the cd. Jeff and Marcel pull it off again. great stuff. Who would think that they could do ""Darling Nikki"" by Prince or ""Frozen"" by Madonna and turn it into a Heavy Metal song? Don't get me wrong, the rest of the cd's original songs are great also."
4,Love this stroller BUT very heavy,"This stroller is great if your going to go on long walks, amusement parks etc, it can carry all your stuff with no problem! works great, very roomy for baby, smooth ride, when in upright position my son tends to go to the side, so I keep a small blanket to make him more comfy.He loves the toy, sounds, etc.I just purchased the clear plastic cover for those chilly days and it fit perfect.My only pet peeve is that it's so bulky, heavy and clumsy, closing it you have to make sure the back is all the way up or it jams and if your not strong, you'll struggle. I have a mini van and it takes up a huge amount of space back there.Other than that, I would recommend it."
2,"I love it, but its way too short",I love the color and the cloth fabric. I bought this stroller for my daughter. I love the toy on it as well. However it is too heavy and it is way too LOW. I am 5 foot 8 inches and the handle bar does not come up enough. I have to walk humped over. I would have never bought this if I knew this. Since the handle bar is so short I can not take long strides either. You stay too close to the stroller. I hate this.
4,great stroller for walking!,"I LOVE the music on the move feature- it makes my walks so much more fun, and my baby loves music too! Cup holders and storage basket are big. It has a nice ride and folds pretty easily. I won't be putting it in my car, so not sure about how it will fit, but for the most part a great stroller. It was very easy to assemble too. The only thing is, it could use a little more cushioning on the seat, but I just put a nice soft blanket and head support in."
4,A Smooth Stroll,"If you have a vehicle with a large trunk, this is a very good stoller. It is easy to turn and it's smooth on a bumpy terrain. There is a lot of storage space and the seat reclines to any degree you wish. The space for the cd player on the adult cup holder tray would be better used as a storage compartment but, it may be a plus for music lovers. I would actually only recommend this stoller for SUV or mini-van owners as it does not fold down compactly. It barely fits in my Nissan Maxima Sedan."
4,Great Walking Stroller,"Pre-baby, I loved to walk for exercise. I received the Peg Perego Pliko for a shower gift but found it inadequate for walking on park paths and in our neighborhood (no sidewalks). I am 5'9"" and the Liberty also accommodates my long stride-length. Following the directions, it was easy to assemble. Overall, I am please with my purchase."
4,Great Stroller,"This stroller has everything. The music is a nice to have but I don't find myself using the music that often. Can Easily manuver this stroller. It is heavy and big when folded and I have heard from a friend that it does not fit in the trunk of her Honda, but I have no problems getting the stroller into the back of my station wagon."
4,A rich novel about International Law in 19th Century Russia,"My admiration for Jaan Kross first developed after reading The Czar's Madman a number of years ago. I then bought and started this later book, but found it required a degree of concentration that I could not give it. Now, several years later, I have finally picked it up and re-read it, and am very glad that I did.This book is beautifully written, and for that alone it is well worth reading. However, if one is interested in the history of late 19th Century Russia, it is also a refreshing tale filled with interesting historical connections.Jaan Kross has proved himslef to be a great literary figure, and one of the rare examples of Estonian fiction available in the West. His writing is not particularly well suited to all audiences and tastes, but hold great promise for those with a love for Russia and Baltic culture and history."
2,Unbelievably bad CD from a usually reliable artist,"I usually like Carly Simon - the OLD Carly Simon of ""You're So Vain"" and all the other hits she had right through the 1980's, but I don't like the Carly Simon who sings on this CD. It's simply awful.It almost sounds like she's forcing herself along. She seems to have no sense of the meaning behind the classic lyrics she's singing; her interpretations are uniformly flat and uninteresting, and performed without any ease. ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" and ""In the Still of the Night"" are especially, un-listenably, bad. The arrangement and vocal for ""My One and Only Love"" --woo, particularly awful, especially when this version is compared with the glorious, sensual Paula Jones/Chris Botti version of a few years back. Gershwin must be spinning in his grave with Ms. Simon's interpretation of ""How Long Has This Been Going On"". I am extremely glad I borrowed this CD from the library as a ""test"" before any purchase took place!"
2,Disappointing,I loved the song selections. But Carly's voice doesn't seem to reflect the mood. Sorry....
3,Carly Simon slightly overreaching,"It's a spotty album--some beautiful cuts and some where she goes where she simply shouldn't go. You have to admire Carly Simon's attempts at reaching beyond her artistic range, but sometimes it just doesn't work."
1,Unfortunately Past Her Prime,"Like many 70's artist now in their sixties (think Rod Stewart, Barry Manilow, Bette Midler, etc.), Ms. Simon has cut and album of standards instead of producing new original material. Initially, I thought this was a good idea as I liked the ""70s"" Carly Simon and hadn't heard anything from her in a couple of decades. Unfortunately, she does not have the breath or range to sing these songs properly which are more demanding than her original work. In many songs she almost talks her way through them and simply cannot hold or reach the notes. I prefer to remember the early Carly when her voice was stronger. If you like the material, try Diana Krall or Nora Jones instead."
1,Channelling Lucy,I thought that Carly Simon sounded like she was channelling Lucille Ball!She sounds like every other lounge singer in a small bar in a small town. She actually made Rod Stewart sound good.I'm the same age as she is and I knew when it was time to stop.
3,"Carly, fire your producer.","Longtime fan of Carly Simon and an afficianado of standards, I appreciate her vocals. Producer Richard Perry has blanketed the whole album with what sounds like band-in-the-box synth string-and-drum kit -- and, incredibly, he doesn't even seem to have changed the tempo setting from song to song. Carly might as well be singing karaoke. I sense that Perry doesn't respect the material. Please, let's have a return to the inventive and eclectic approach on MY ROMANCE and TORCH, where the arrangements gave Carly room to interpret."
1,Carly can do better,"On yet another ""standards songbook"" by Carly, this is probably the worst one she has to offer, listen to all her S pronounciations (lispy) in the songs (did she do this on purpose?), it was annoying. They could of at least dubbed these or remixed them, she sings off key in alot of the songs on this CD, her voice sounds strained, its not the Carly most of us are used to. I bought this CD and since it had been opened I only got a partial credit when I went to return it, I traded it in for some earlier stuff, Carly was nominated for a Grammy for this CD?, you would be better off listening to the singers that made these songs really great, I had high hopes for this CD to.............."
5,Wonderful,Love her love the CD. Its just great. You may think ahhhh another standards album but this is wonderfully arranged and Carlys voice just adds to these old standards. Lets hope she puts out a pop CD next time. A number One in my book.
2,Not her thing!,"Carly stepped into the standards area a la Rod Stewart, but seems to be out of her element. The voice just doesn't fit the style and actually shows the weaknesses in her talent. I'm a Carly fan, but this was a mistake."
4,doesn't work with iTunes,love the album---her voice is still as amazing as it was in the 70's and 80's but the only big complaint is that you can't put the disc into your iTunes library. So forget about enjoying the great music on your iPod. Would never have bought it if I knew I could only listen to it on home stereo or in my car!!
1,Sad,"It's really sad when a once first rank performer doesn't know when it's time to retire. I'm reminded of the old review of a concert where the critic said ""So-And-So played Beethoven. Beethoven lost"". This pretty well describes this performance, where Carly Simon struggles to sound no better than a semi-gifted amateur."
2,a big disappointment!,"I am a Carly Simon fan but this CD didn't do it for me. Listening to the CD I remember thinking: gee, I can do that...it seems to lack, well, passion maybe?I think a lot of people are comparing her CD with Rod Stewart's beautifully put together albums of old melodies, I know I do and unfortunately, she doesn't compare.."
3,Watch out! It may not play on your player!,"Amazon should note (as does the packaging) that ""The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players."" In my case it does play on my audio system, BUT the audio side of the disc does NOT play on my Mac. The DVD side does play on my Mac. Had I known this at the outset I would have purchased the audio disc."
1,Dreadful.,"Carly just kills these songs, these are some of the most anodyne versions of these that I've heard.Do yourself a favour and get the originals."
5,Midnight Serenade by Carly Simon,"Being brought up to Glenn Miller music and the music of the late 40's and 50's, Carly Simon's latest reminds me of the songs I heard on the radio as a little girl. The songs are romantic and easy to sing along with as compared to what some people call music today. Carly is at her best in this cd. I sent one of these to a friend in Germany and he also related to the songs and the wonderful arrangements. Carly gets better every year."
4,Lush and Rich and Perfectly Retro,Carly can sing just about anything. Her unique sound is perfect for these classic romantic songs. She digs in with both feet and it's gorgeous!
3,Disappointing,"I enjoyed Carly Simon's other forays into the American Songbook, but I cant say I like this one very much. I can only lay the blame on producer Richard Perry. Does every song have to be sung at the same tempo or arranged like 2nd rate lounge music? There is also a curious lack of feeling in Simon's singing as well. I guess it beats listening to Rod Stewart, but I'm very disappointed. I'm being very charitable in giving this 3 stars. More for Carly and the song choices, than anything. Pop Film Noir into your CD player after listening to this and you'll get my drift."
1,Mitch Miller meets Carly,"I am a worshipful fan of Carly Simon. Her album, My Romance, is my all-time favorite album, but Mooonlight Seranade is an awful album. Richard Perry, the producer, ought to be ashamed. The music behind Carly sounds like Mitch Miller with synthesizer. The beat is so mechanical that I suspect a drum machine was used. Clearly the tracks were pre-recorded so that when Carly went into the studio to add in the vocal, she was totally hemmed in by what had been done. Even Carly's superb voice couldn't save this album.Budget is no excuse for this travesty. The same material recorded with a trio: piano (or guitar), bass and drums would have been memorable but with a mechanized Mitch Miller feel...Lord... what was Perry thinking?!"
2,No Torch,"Having been a Carly Simon fan for years, I bought this because it was new and enjoyed the selections.But, too bad she recorded with the Holiday Inn band. What a disappointment of accompanying artists and arrangements.When the disc is on multiple choice and her trac comes up, people say, ""Who is that?""I tell them it is Carley disguising her voice being embarassed over her musicians."
1,CARLY SHOWS HER AGE,"AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT CARLY HAS DEFINITELY LOST HERONCE MAGNIFICENT VOICE? YES, IT WAS HUSKIER, BUT IT WAS ALSOSHAKY AND AT TIMES HER VOICE SEEMED TO CRACK. I WAS VERYDISAPPOINTED IN THIS RECORDING BECAUSE I LOVE HER OTHERSTANDARD ALBUMS BUT THE YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN KIND TO HERVOICE. THE SONG SELECTION WAS GREAT AS WERE THE ARRANGEMENTSBUT SHE SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS 70 YEARS OLD INSTEAD OF 60.I'M AFRAID MY DAYS OF BUYING CARLY CDS ARE GONE."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I usually prefer listening to male singers, but Carly Simons renditions of the old classics are excellent. She has a low, soothing voice which suits the mood of the music. Its a great choice along with Rod's and Barry's albums ofthe same genre."
1,Not the stuff that dreams are made of!,"granted, I may not have liked it because it wasnt what i wanted, I didnt even know about this CD, I said i wanted her recent CD, thinking it would be some new stuff.....when i realized it was similiar to what Rod Stewart did, i thought what a waste!! The first song was good....her voice sounded great, by the time i got to I only have eyes for you?? i thought what happended!! that song seemed sooo off key!!what i do want and know i will love it the CD Reflections. she is too good to be following Rod in his pursuit of whatever it is.This CD was just not ""the stuff that dreams are made of""!"
1,Disappointing. Pedestrian.,"I was really looking forward to this one for a variety of reasons; & no one's going to want to hear it, but this disc just leaves me cold.The best thing I can say is ... a great list of tunes. Should have been a smash!So much talent not just undelivered, but not even stirred. Some of the tunes sounded like she was in the wrong register, 'cause she just couldn't get her diaphram under them. She didn't seem to be really trying, but coasting or something ... it just wasn't there. ""Disappointing"" is what it was for me, big time.Add in the arrangements, which seemed even less inspired, like it was played twice from the songbook's sheet music, then recorded. All in all, it was real ""pedestrian."" Compare with Linda Rhonstadt & Nelson Riddle, or with even the least of Rod Stewart's 3 recent discs, & you'll see what I mean.Carly can do better, a lot better; & we deserve better."
2,the star has gone dim,"Unfortunately, Carley's singing has gone rather flat. She tries hard with some great songs but the results are disappointing."
4,another lazy record. Maybe she's so vain...,"Good job but maybe just a job. Too much people had sing that songs. Too easy take some classic tracks with a great producer, like ""immaculate"" Richard Perry, and make a ""new"" record.Great interpretations, but I hope some good original love songs by Miss Simon, played with young musicians. She need new energy."
1,Carly- please retire now!,"I used to be a Carly fan in my younger days. No more.This is a very disapointing recording saved only by the good orchestral arrangements.Her voice has tired, some notes were wrongly pitched and it lacks soul all together.One day, when Carly retires to an old age home, I hope they will play these serenades back to her every day, by the moonlight."
2,Kathleen Herrera - Whitehall PA,"DISAPPOINTED! Ran out and got this album as soon as Borders stocked it. Although the songs selected are terrific, this album does not compare to her Film Noir album. Carley's voice on Moonlight is flat and lacks tonal color. The orchestrations are unimaginative. Too bad Jimmy Webb couldn't have worked with her on this one,also."
2,do yourself a favor and get TORCH,"this is carly simon's 4th CD of standards---i am a carly simonfan---love her elektra/warner bros. CD""s---this new one isjust slow and boring---just a bunch of hype due to a bigpromotion by sony---they are all putting out classic songsCD and none of them don't even come close to the beauty andhonesty of ""Torch""--maybe it is because carly was going throughher divorce with james taylor--all u have to do is look at thesongs on ""Torch"" and you will say this is the absolute mostperfect CD"
1,Carly Simon Moonlight Serenade,"Sorry to say, though I have enjoyed Ms. Simon over the years..this latest CD is an uncomfortable listen. Menu of songs could not be better..however, Simons voice sounds...""old""...and unpleasant to the ear. Also her ""cute"" little remark following a selection makes her sound just silly. Perhaps her illness in recent years has caused the voice change. Perhaps she should wait til this situation clears, should that be able to happen...Surely she doesn't want ""stuff"" out there to be remembered years from now..(think recent Liza groanings/err recordings)"
5,Moonlight Serenade,What a great CD; Carly is very good with these standards and brings many good memories. Excellent CD and recommend highly.
3,longtime Carly fan,As much as I have enjoyed Carly Simon over the last 30+ years this CD is disappointing. The song selection is comfortable but the voice quality is just not there anymore. Nobody is sadder than me.
2,MOONLIGHT LEMONADE?,"CARLY....WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? THIS IS NOT A SERENADE,IT'S LEMONADE WITH NO SUGAR!TAKE MY ADVICE...WHOEVER ADVISED YOU TO MAKE THIS CD, YOU SHOULD KICK THEM BETWEEN THE POCKETS!"
1,BORING!!,Expected soooo much more. Carly just breezes through each song as though she were singing it for the first time from the sheet music.
1,Time to go home,"It is time for Ms Simon to go home and enjoy the fruits of her previous labors. Her latest CD reveals that age has not been kind to her voice. It cracks and struggles for breath, although the producer has tried to secret her foundered attempt with electronic imaging. The songs are true standards, and that, unfortunately, is the best that anyone can say about this very bad CD."
2,very Average,I dig Carly Simon as a Musician&Songwriter but this direction isn't the answer. alot of the songs have the same arrangements&her voice never fully swings for me. this Album might have worked 10 years back for Her were it not for everybody else jumping on the standards bandwagon.this Album never cooks for me.
1,A Carly Simon Fan,"I'm sorry to say so, but I totally agree with others who have been disappointed in this CD!I remember hearing Carly's first album back in the 70's and being so thrilled by what an original talent she was ...and still is I'm sure ...even though you'd never know it to hear this recording! I agree with other reviewers who fault the arrangements ... they're typically ""elevator music"" inspired. Great songs but my goodness, Carly, you, personally, must have been very disappointed when you heard the final result."
3,Moonlight Serenade by Carly Simon,"The songs (old standards) are great, but just in my honest opinion, her voice just is not tuned for these type songs. Her voice isn't as smooth and polished as you would expect from someone singing these songs. Now Rod Stewart did a wonderful job in his trilogy and would like to see him do more. Carly Simon just didn't pull it off !!"
1,Moonlight Serenade,"Carly is holding back! She's holding out! While I adore MY ROMANCE, on MOONLIGHT SERENADE she is consistently restrained (as opposed to disciplined), her voice has lost some brilliance and the tempo on almost every selection drags and droops. Oh my gosh, Carly, find new/better people!"
2,Ouch...Very disappointing.,"My wife loves the Rod Stewart albums. I bought this for her as a present. When listening from the other room, it sounded like there was a sick cow in the house. I don't think this CD will get a lot of play in our house."
4,Memories from a long time ago,"The dual disc is great. The songs brought back memories from World War II when many of them were among our favorites. I've listened to it many, many times and find no fault with the arr-angments or Carly Simon's renditions. Thank you."
3,A Great Addition to the American Songbook,"This is a delightful album and it's a pleasure to see Carly continue to embrace great standards. But it certainly pales in comparison to the stunning debut album by John Stevens. Steven's 'Red,' with amazing arrangements and production by Steve Tyrell and David Foster, sets a new ""standard"" for standards.Still, I don't want to discourage anyone from buying this CD. I'm especially pleased with Carly's song selection which includes some less frequently recorded gems. Get Carly and John Stevens, add a little Rod Stewart, some classic Peggy Lee and Julie London and the gold standard of all, the three disk Linda Rondstadt collection, hit random play and you're in heaven."
1,major disappointment,"Terrible album. The arrangements are blah and Carly sings them as if she's sleep walking or zonked on Valium. Her interpretations of these great songs are soulless, styleless and simply boring. The voice seems to have no high register anymore, but even using her lower register, Carly could have put a little feeling into her renditions. She did it on Torch and My Romance, so what in the world happened here? What was Richard Perry, the ""great"" producer, thinking. Or maybe she just can't sing anymore. If so, please retire, Carly, and live sumtuously on your royalties, which last I heard amounted to around half a million a year."
1,WARNING: DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"When my CD player refused to recognize the audio side of this DualDisc, I got curious and started reading the packaging. Inside the box, on a separate card, is the following statement: ""The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players."" In other words, the company is knowingly selling a defective product. They are marketing this product as having a CD audio side, but it is not CD audio."
2,Stick to what you do best,"Carly does not presently have the voice for standards. Shepossibly could with retraining, but that would change the soundof her core repertoire that made her famous.The pieces are sung too low to show the nuancesand colors of standards. Then there are pitch problems. I'veloved Carly on her earlier music, and recommend she stick toher own genre and not try to cross over. For standards, I'drecommend Jane Monheit, and Queen Latifah's Dana Owens album."
2,I've heard her do better,I was rather disappointed in this CD. I guess I am not crazy about Carly in this genre.
1,The GAS will recover,"Yikes. Poor Carly has trouble enunciating the lyrics, and the half-an-octave range of her gravelly voice turns these Great American Songbook tunes into mush."
3,Great but...,"Very nice video, what there was of it. Carly sings well but there are only 11 songs. I couldn't help but compare this to the Rod Stewart CDs. Rod's selections were much better. I bought the two-sided disc but the audio side would not play in my DVD player."
4,Worked well for my board,"I had a large (15x21) board covered with flux residue from soldering. I used most of the can, but it did do a pretty good job of removing all the gunk from the board. Evaporates quickly without much odor, leaves no residue behind."
4,Ak's Review,"This laptop is very nice in it's white color. It stands out from the rest. It is a good, fair price and it is not the most High tech but it is a nice computer for a younger kid like me. I'm getting one this week."
2,Sad,"I have never owned one of these computers, but In school we were assigned a research project to find information on the internet. Our teacher allowed us to use some new Ibooks that our school had just purchased. Everyone was so excited because these computers are so cool looking and everyone thought they were fast. We started our project and quickly realized that these were the slowest computers anyone of us had ever used. We were using wireless internet which may have contributed to the computer's slowness, but still it was pathetic. There were maybe 10 people using these computers and about 2/3 of us abandoned the Ibooks to go use the Imacs that our school got in 1998. It also could have been that (even with nortan anit-virus) these computers are very vulnerable to viruses. I'm not sure about how these computers perform in things other than the internet, but if you are planning to buy one of these Ibooks mainly for use on the internet, I would definitly not recommend this computer."
5,Value Priced Reissue of the 2003 boxset,"This is a real bargain reissue of the 2003 edition, which is identical in musical content and remastering. I have that. I wonder if this edition has the 2 books with photos from that 2003 edition (which were in French), or whether it has different books(in English? same photos?)or just the absolute minimum info (songs and dates?) Can someone educate us with another review? What is the internal packaging of the discs like: paper sleeves, cardboard sleeves, or CDs in little slots in a foldout?"
5,Mesmerizing....Piaf,"I don't normally write reviews here ,this; my first I think . I am published elsewhere.What can I say..I have listened to every cd...I prefer lps. However; this collectionwas a work of love. I have compared these discs to other tranfers. The entire collection is musical and the tranfers are superb. To me, given the price and excellence...you need only buy this one, no other. If you are not mesmerized by the quality and gifts of this tortured artist..there is nothing more that I can say. To those who buy this and have the same experience ( I own over 30,000 records plus cds with a world class system) as I did ..I envy the pleasure you will find in your discovery....enjoy!!"
1,NOT worth your money or time,"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter. We sat down together to play it and I noticed right away the HORRENDOUS quality of the graphics. Oh my gosh, the Barbies didn't even look like Barbies and there were quite a few fuzzy spots and the landscape was blocky. When she talked, her mouth wrinkles up weird and the rest of her face is like stone.The second bad thing about the game is when two hours later, my daughter said, ""Mom, I wish I hadn't got this game. I've already beat it."""
2,one word...aw-full,"this is a cute game but needs some changes like a better challenging game or some neat and pretty graphics oh yah and its a plot change because the story in the game dosent follow the story in the movie! its a weired, easy and basically ugly game! im sorry for the people who like it just that thats my oponionfacts:terrible graphicsdosnt follow the story plot lineopinion:easy game(maybe good for under 6)not as fun as the movie!hope it helps and remember my opinion dosnt count! but the facts do!"
1,"Terrible, terrible quality! Do not buy!!!","I bought this game for my daughter at Christmas and I wish I could take it back. She wants me to watch her play it but I can't, I get headaches watching it. The quality is horrible and the story line was changed but despite all that, she loves the game. It's very easy to play and she beat it within an hour. Next time I will definitely check the reviews out before buying and I hope you all do too!"
4,Lots of fun for my granddaughter,"This computer game is lots of fun for my granddaughter. It took her a while to get into it, because in the beginning she got a bit frustrated with the program, going round in circles, but eventually she got through the intitial stages and then she loved it. She is 10 years old and pretty handy with her computer games.I can recommend this game based on her experiences with it."
1,ZERO stars ZERO fun! very poor quality game,"When I first put this in the computer I thought it was a badly burnt fake copy, the quality is TERRIBLE and I have more than the minimum system requirements. It is too difficult to move Barbie around, the silly arrow key movements are too difficult - she won't walk in the direction you face her, the angle keeps changing and I was suffering a major case of vertigo watching/helping my daughter play it.The Princess and the Pauper game also has arrow movements (but thankfully you can use the mouse for most of it), but they are much easier than this one. Save your money and buy the Rapunzel game (our favourite) or the Princess and Pauper game, the Pegasus game is rubbish. Really poor graphics, difficult to move Barbie around, sound is way below par - a big disappointment - I'll be using this one as a coaster for my coffee cup!"
5,Fantastic. I'm not crazy! It really IS them!,"I am so glad I read this book. It confirmed the problems I had with NA/AA that I could not put into words. Clearly written, Ragge lays out exactly how ""newcomers"" are tricked into turning their lives over to ""the program"" and kept there by the threat of ""jails, institutions, and death"". Bless his heart for writing it. He put an end to 8 years of NA/AA hell for me."
3,A very technical look at what AA is really about,"This book really won't hold any interest to anyone who hasn't actually been to an AA meeting before. It does ring true though to someone who has gone through the process and realized that it does not relate to them. This book does a nice job of confirming the notion that alcoholism is not a disease, but rather a character defect; that the 12-step process is a counter-productive process riddled with endless cliches; and that spirituality nor religion have anything to do with controlling, and ultimately ending one's addiction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has found that the AA process doesn't fit with their ideals or desired way-of-life."
1,How about joining a 12 step group,"I suggest the author actually decides to work the steps himself, they help you to deal with things like resentment! Almost anyone in a 12 step program will be wondering what on earth he is talking about, not all groups are the same, but at the end of the day the real issue concerning AA and others is if a group is actually working the steps or not! 12 step groups may not be for everybody who needs them, and even lots who do decide to join may not be so willing to follow the program. But that's a completely different issue! I can testify to the fact that anyone who is humbly and honestly working steps 1 through 12 will see new hope and a new joy in their life, this program goes beyond simple sobriety. How much are you willing to let it do what you can't do for yourself!"
2,You guys have it all wrong....,"I can't believe that they packaged Casual Sex? with Cold Comfort Farm. All I want is my own copy of Casual Sex, but I am forced to buy Cold Comfort Farm? Who's even heard of this movie? Please..."
4,Great Jazzy Funk,The Titles (Down With It & Rod's Tune) go under the skin. Great CD for all occasions. Pure Jazz for everyone. Enjoy!
1,Some books on planning can be too basic; this is one of them,This book is published by a vanity press. Its contents would amount to an average size essay save for the fact that every page is double spaced including examples of forms and questionnaires. There are many questionable assumptions best demonstrated by the author's claim that most family reunions are planned around summer holidays! Perhaps I was looking for a little more substantive suggestions than provided by this book which takes one through the most basic of basics in planning. Fully one-third of its 83 double-spaced pages is taken up by sample forms and illustrations.
2,Disappointed with CD,I have seen this movie several times over the years. I was hoping to get some of the Welsh music from it to play at my daughter's wedding (for example: Myfawny played at Blodwyn's wedding in the movie) but it wasn't on it. Just really disappointed that all of the songs from movie weren't on the soundtrack.
5,A good reference dictionary,"This is an excellent dictionary for students of Russian. It is well-organized, attractive, and I have to not find a word I need. However, it is pretty big. I wouldn't advise buying it as a travel ditionary."
3,crappy shipping,"I have to say that I was not impressed with the shipping. I ordered the flutes for my own wedding, and they arrived broken and shattered. While I have ordered replacements at the cost of amazon, it will be 2 months before they arrive. I am glad I ordered them early, because I could have potentially been without the flutes for my wedding if I had waited 2 months before the wedding as recommended by others."
1,Badly packaged--arrived broken!,"The flutes may be nice, but I don't know. When I picked up the box I knew I was in trouble as it sounded of broken glass. Although the box did not appear to have been mishandled, there was no packaging on the inside of the box, so the glasses had bounced around like pinballs. I will have to return and will update when the actual product arrives. However, I am highly disappointed by Amazon's packaging procedures. There was literally NOTHING to protect the glasses from breaking."
2,I was disappointed in this one because it's never worked...,"I was greatly disappointed in this toy. One of the units has never worked. But, with the papers, boxes, etc. from Christmas, the packaging got tossed so I couldn't return it. For a... gift, it was a huge let-down. I was hoping for so much more! At LEAST a toy that worked! Don't waste your $$ on this one."
5,Its just like paintball,It rocks.If your parents dont wont you to play real paintball because its messy......get this virtual paintball game.just as good as real paintball.
3,12yr old paintball player,"This toy was ok, but it is a disgrace to the paintball name. No. 1 real paint ball dosent hurt it sings for about a second but it goes away and pluse the stinging is half the fun thats what keeps you wanting to play. No. 2 if you wash your clothes, (like most of us do ) you can get the paint off it wont stain. This toy was ok but nothing like paintball."
1,REALLY BAD TOY,Who in the world invented this cheap game? This has nothing to do with paintballing the guns don't even look like paintball guns and thats just the start of this horrible TOY that they call safer than real paintballing!
3,Doesn't even compare to the real thing!,"This is another sorry infringment on paintball. The box for this reads 'No Pain, NO Stain"". First of all, real paintball doesn't hurt. It feels like someone thumping you and it goes away in a few seconds. Second, paintballs do not 'stain' your clothing, If you wash them off within 48 hours, they do not leave a mark ( if people would read their packaging they'd know that). I don't get why they had to turn laser tag into a paintball rip off. This has nothing to do with paintball, or is it an accurate simulation. The reason real paintball markers can't shoot 500ft is because the paintball is a round, un-aerodynamic projectile that creates drag. Lasers are beams of light and are 100% accurate and not affected by wind. With paintball you have to guess trajectory, and put the wind into consideration.Conclusion:Don't get ripped off and schemed by some company trying to put the real sport of paintbal out of buisness"
1,terrible,I was excited to get this for my 6 yr old. It looks likea lot of fun but it is decieving. The batteries dont last verylong the sound is not very loud and it just doesn't workfor any distance and overall its a lousy product. I have itright now still sitting in the box after trying it a couple oftimes and being dissappointed. Don't buy this there isplenty more things out there for the money....the shippingwas not worth it either
2,Poor quality -- DOA,"I bought this for my 9-year old son as a Christmas gift. The idea is great but the execution is very poor. As soon as we put the batteries in and turned on the laser guns, one of them just died!!!I've tried to contact the toll-free customer support line but all I get is either a busy signal or voice mail.I am disappointed with the product's poor quality and the manufacturer's poor customer support."
1,Defective Toy,"I'm with you Bill Samford! Got this toy for grandchildren for Christmas. Opened it up on Christmas morning...loaded the batteries...and BAM! One gun fires, the other one doesn't. Try telling a 5 and a 3 year old that their Christmas present doesn't work! How disappointing is that?"
1,Broke when I bought it,"Got it for my son for Christmas. Opened it up on Christmas morning...loaded the batteries...and BAM! One gun fires, the other one doesn't. Imagine the look on my 6 year old's face when I told him we couldn't play, the gun is defective. You really let me down ToyMax. Sorry, you get no points from this Dad."
4,fFinally a comprehensive text for MEDIA SELLING,There have been scores of texts devoted to transactional selling skills. There are also some fine texts on Media Planning and buying....This is the first that I have uncovered that gives a comprehensive view to the skills needed to establish value and compete as a media sales rep. I was in radio sales management for27 years..I am currently teaching Advertising Sales at the University level...this text resembles the first 3 months of a rookie sales person.
5,This book is clear and comprehensive,"I have worked in the media business for more than 15 years, have taken training courses offered by my company and industry groups. None of them covered all the topics in this book as clearly and comprehensively as this book does. It presents the ""numbers"" aspects of media very well and says more in a direct way about how to deal with clients than any other book I have read or course I have taken. I would have avoided a lot of mistakes if I had read this book 15 years ago!"
2,Westinghouse intercom,"Mine quite working after about 6 months, but I don't know what to recommend instead, since Westinghouse was supposed to be the best."
5,Perfect Watch-,Love this watch!!!! Perfect size for someone who doesn't like the large face watches. The band is slightly long but ok. Bought a similar skagen watch in 2004 and it has lasted until now-quality product!
5,"Very, Very Nice!","Slim, supple leather, beautiful case! This is possibly my favorite watch; Nicer than some of my much more expensive watches. Quality made. You should love it!"
5,Cute little watch,"This watch is a little cutie, fits perfectly who has small wrists and likes small watches. The watch works great without any complex settings and the the leather strap is one of the finest we ever see. I gifted this watch to my Wife and Sister and they are in love with this watch instantly. It goes well will all occassions. I will definitely recommend this product."
4,Looks Great!,"This watch looks really nice. However, the face is quite small and it's pretty hard to read (and set) without any numbers. I love it though!"
4,I love Skagen watches!,"I have a Skagen watch collection and I like this size of this one because it is small & delicate, and I didn't have one with a black strap. I have recently sold my larger more bulky watches."
3,Watch for all styles,"Loved how this watch looked. However, my biggest flaw with this watch was how hard it was to tell time on it!! When I first got the watch I did not think that numbers were important, but they are. I love Skagen, and I will keep buying watches from them because of how nice they look and how well they work. Another small issue, the band gets bad after about a year, and is hard to find a replacement for."
2,Too small,"Its a very nice watch, however when they say slim, they mean it!! I almost needed a magnifying glass to see anything on the watch. Needless to say, I returned it."
2,Bamboo Storage Chests,"This beautiful bamboo storage set is not practical at all. I really thought I could use it for winter hats or gloves but that didn't work out. Gave it to my mother who uses it in her small apartment to block the kitchen by placing it on her entry way bar. I'm giving it a 2 star rating because although the baskets are lovely, the storage is not there!"
4,third way--a viable option,"This book was used in an Episcopal adult Sunday school Class. Discussed, and rediscussed, argued, pried apart from many more than 3 sides.Content was complete, literate, challenging. This book is still causingdiscussions, with the third way emerging from obscurity to reality."
4,Jesus and Nonviolence,An excellent clear and inspiring work. Presenting an interpretation of the Gospel passages that are frequently wrontly understood. A must read for those working for Social Justice.
1,Stuck in the 1980's,"I couldn't believe it when I got this thing in the mail. The data set for the software is on a FLOPPY DISK! How many students have even seen one? It's almost impossible to buy a computer with a floppy disk drive these days. Worse yet, the software is antiquated, with an obsolete user interface and a worthless help system. I had to upload the data files to our shared data area so that the other students could download them and write them onto some other kind of drive (USB stick, for example). You MUST have the data saved to a rewritable drive - it won't accept a directory on your hard drive.What a piece of junk, and at an outrageous price. Oh yes, did I mention that the software doesn't match the written instructions in the book?"
4,A Sweet Story about a sweet lady,"Betty Jean writes honestly of her childhood in the hills of Kentucky. She went on to become a writer-in-demand in Nashville for her country-western songs. She wrote of how she had everything life had to offer, but no joy and peace of mind could be found. After recommitting her life to God, it made a difference in her song-writing. Now she writes songs about the change in her life, her love for God and her plans to make Heaven her permanent home. You will enjoy this book."
5,One of the Best!,"One of the best books - a true story of triumph thru sorrow and also continuing gladness thru anything! Be ready to read it through as you won't want to put it down (except to maybe wipe some tears!) But not all tears of sorrow; you will have tears of gladness, too! After the book, get some of her CD's and share them. I was first ""introduced"" to Betty Jean about thirty years ago and never tire of her, and the Holy Spirit flows over her into your presence. (The first time I heard Betty Jean, I did not even know ""the Holy Spirit"" could ""flow"" on earth AND I STILL SENSED THE SPIRIT OF GOD!) You can't miss it with this one! Get some for gifts -great for mothers, sisters, everyone!"
3,Good for understanding the word's way of thinking,"I'd recommend this book if you've been indoctrinated with the world's way of building relationships and are seeking to see things from a biblical perspective. It exposes the flaws and pitfalls of the world's way of building relationships.It explains ways in which men and women view commitment and show commitment based on the world's standard. What I liked most about it is how the author delves into how we ""unwittingly"" become attached to people without knowing it (see the chapter on counterfeit oneness).It does however suggest that the reader seek the guidance of God on choosing a mate 'subjectively' which opens one to error (the author makes references to 'Experiencing God' by Blackaby).Romans 8 says the Holy Spirit will lead you if you're a child of God so let's just trust God (John 14:1).Prov 3:5-6 - Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge and he will make your paths straight."
5,God's Blessing,"This book is truly a blessing from God. For years I have been praying for God to send me a girlfriend and mate. But God kept telling me that I was not ready and even that I may never marry. This disturbed me greatly and I became depressed. God took me from my depression and I discovered this book at a Christian Book store. It changed my whole perspective on God's plan for my life and what he has in store. I realized that being single is a blessing and not a curse. I shall wait for whatever God has in store for me and pray for his continued blessings. This book is a study guide which always references the word of God and provides real life examples of how God's plan really works. Love and marriage our not ours to decide. It is a gift from God and ""Choosing God's Best"" is a uplifting guide which helps you through the journey."
4,"Clear, detailed, & to the point","As of father of 3 - '20 something' Christian children, I enjoyed reading this book. After reading E. Elliot's things & ""I Kissed Dating Goodby"" , I found this most helpfull. The author talks in a 'concrete sequental' manner, with diagrahms of spiritual/emotional/physical involvement. He focuses on Courtship being the only biblical answer for romantic relationships, and although somewhat legalistic in his out-working of that premise, still very helpfull."
1,I would never recommend this book...,"This book is waaaaaay too legalistic. If your looking for a good book to see how God views dating, get Boundaries in Dating. My girlfriend and i loved that."
5,Changed Life!!!,"This book was suggested to me and it has change my life, thinking and improved my relationship and fellowship with God. I am recommending it to others and would highly recommend it to you."
4,TWO DIFFERENT COVERS -SAME INSIDE,"Hey,I confirmed with the publisher that there are two different covers for this item but the inside is the same!"
5,Excellent Book- Great for Youth Group Study,"I have read this book several times and the truths are timeless. The book touches on quite a few important issues such as Counterfeit Oneness, and making a good choice versus a God choice.I found chapters 3, 4, 6 and 8 to be particularly inspiring. It is a definite must read for every single Christian who is serious about pleasing God and preparing a Godly foundation for marriage.Read this book and you will have a wiser approach to relationships."
2,Not what I was hoping for!,"If you are not a card carrying member of the Christian Coalition, this book will most likely not pertain to you. While the author's ideas are very commendable, some are quite extreme! I am a good Christian girl wanting some direction on what to do have a Godly relationship now that I have met the one and did not find it in this book."
5,God's Best Found Me!!!,"This book changed my life for the better. I was a content single in 1998 when I read this for the first time, but now I'm happily married because I learned from Dr. Raunikar that ""dating"" was not for the Christian. The key I learned from this book is what we choose is usually what we consider ""good"", but it's not THE BEST which God has planned for us. Singles can be healed from the damaged caused through ""dating"" relationships and learn to put things in Godly order: spiritual (first - as the basis for selection of a marriage partner), emotional (during courtship), and physical (only for marriage). My husband found me through a blind date in 1999 and we used the principles of the book throughout our courtship. We were married in 2000. I highly recommend that all singles would practice ""Choosing God's Best"" as there's no better than His best!"
2,Disappointing,"I must say that this book was a disappointment. I am a Christian man with a strong faith in God and am always trying to better myself for Him, but this book just seemed to be a typical self help book, but with the fire and brimstone of the Old Testament thrown in to scare you into behaving a certain way. I realize that some religious denominations operate this way, but God is Love. Trust in God, He knows what is best for you and He will always guide you to lasting happiness."
4,Pretty Good Movie - 2 Titles,"I liked this movie. It moved well and was a typical 80s/90s movie, trying to make a point about a current event problem happening at the time. I noticed when it first came on that it was the same movie that I had purchased earlier under a different title ""Hostile Witness"". I'm not sure what the reason was for this. All of the actors were good in their perspective roles. The movie is captivating but you do have to pay attention. All in all, a nice flick."
2,Wrong Picture,This is for the two sway bar bushings ONLY. Not what's pictured. End links are NOT included with this purchase!
1,NOT A DOT -A-DOT ART book,"This book is overprice, It is JUST A SIMPLE COLORING BOOK!!Nothing special about it.It is not a dot a dor art book...it doesn't have the circle in the pictures to use dot a dot art.I am very disapointed!! It is just waste on money and time. I am tired of being lied as a customer.If I want a coloring book I can get one in any store in town for less than $3.I was lloking for a dot a dot art book not for a simple coloring book!I went online and find cool printables for dot a dot art activities for free.Im sending this COLORING book back!!"
5,Solid performance,"I got my iBook (600 Mhz) a year ago and have been thrilled. I was a PC user before, and decided that it was time to see what else was available. I couldn't have been happier with my choice. I've used the iBook to make movies of my new son, organize my digital photos, program, surf the web wirelessly, manage all my e-mail accounts, and many other things. To put it simply, it works well. I haven't had any problems with it working with my PC and am able to move files back and forth without issue.You can't go wrong with the iBook. It just works."
5,redesigning my house to go with my ibook,"Firstly for those of you who aren't sure if you should get the 12inch or 14inch ibook. I was a 14inch ibook fan, only reason i got the 12inch was because the 14inch was out of stock. i am sooo glad now that i actually got the 12inch. i was worried the screen might be small but its perfect, its all perfect. the ibook feels strong and can handle bumps here and there. i am a graphic designer and actually looked at the powerbook first. but for the price of the powerbook i could get an ibook AND emac. just make sure you add as much RAM as you can.i orderd the ibook without actually seeing one in real life ever. once you get it, no matter how many pictures you had seen, you will be shocked at the beauty.in conclusion, definetly get the ibook, its really really worth it!"
5,What a great investment!,"I am so very glad that I switched to Mac. I was frustrated up to my neck with Windows, and I am very pleased with the Mac OS--incredibly stable. I am a student, and really need the portability factor. This definitely gives you that! It is so light. I have all I need here: internet, word processing, and cd/dvd combo. I did buy some extra memory, which is a good idea; you can work very well with just the 128 MB, but to be able to open a dozen programs at once, it's always a good idea to have that extra memory--particulary with memory costs as low as they are now. And Amazon.com DEFINITELY had the best price--I did plenty of comparative shopping. Great investment!"
4,Just Perfect!!,"I had been wanting an iBook ever since they came out and when I finally got one, I was thrilled!(700MHz, 256mb) It is the best little thing I have ever had. I am a student, so I take my iBook to school on a regular basis. It is very light, I don't even notice it in my backpack. I use office, and all of the I apps(except for iMovie) and they all run beautifully! I do strongly suggest spending the extra buck and getting at least 256 megs of ram, it makes a big difference. It is very durable. I got the 12' screen and I really prefer it over the 14', it is just the right size. And the battery life is soo good. I have watched a DVD and listened to an hour and a half of music on one charge. I have almost gotten 4 hours out of it. The only downside is that is seems to get really hot on the bottom after running it for a few hours. But other than that, it is wonderful, and very quite and light!!!!!!"
2,iBook highs and lows,"They are sleek and lightweight. I was so happy with my iBook, that I quickly bought another one for my fiance. Even though they were slow to respond when running anything more complex than a text editing program, the small size, top design, and ease of use won me over.However, recently, I have serious doubts of ever owning an Apple again. Now, less than 6 months after making these two purchases, both iBooks are back with Apple technical support services for repair.My troubles also appear to be related the common 'logic board' problem, that has caused hundreds of posts on the Apple support forums.At this point, my only thoughts are how to unload these two systems for something that I can rely on :("
2,Rotten Apples,"Howdy,After months of research I eagerly placed an order for this ibook. The Mac OS was a joy to use, and with maxed ram, I found the ibook to be snappy enough.However, I received a unit with pixel problems. Returned it, ordered another one. Even more pixel problems. Returned it, decided to try my luck with a 14"" ibook. No dead pixels, yahoo! But the logic board and power management unit failed after only two days.Returned it, and have since decided that the ibook, while a nice design with a super OS, is simply too unreliable for my hard earned dollar. More reading on the net has showed that logic board failure is not uncommon for ibooks, even relatively new ones.The only positive in this experience has been Amazon.com. They have been absolutely great about the returns, providing a 100% credit each time.In all, I'm very disappointed in Apple's quality control for the ibook.Your Mileage May Vary!"
1,You'd better think twice!,"I work at an office that has decided to go wireless. I had always used PC's, but was willing to try the ibook. Luckily, I do not have to pay for these worthless machines. In one year, my ibook has completly died four times. The monitor doesn't turn on, and there are no signs of life to it. It does not matter how carefull you are with taking care of it. All four times, the moitor becomes fuzzy, then black, then the machine is dead. Besides the fact that the computer has a life span of two months, it freezes more than any PC I have ever used. When a colorful circle appears on your screen (as it does so often), you can forget about your presentation, or anything else you had been working on. Also, If I recieved a nickle for everytime the desktop suddenly apears and a message saying ""Application Unexpectedly Quit"", I would be a very rich man. Do not invest your hard earned money into this junk, buy something reliable."
1,"students, steer clear","at my school, we have many of these apple notebooks. mabey i got the wrong impression, but these ibooks are horrible. they take litteraly 9 minuts to turn on.they are slow and unreliable. im stiken with my new hp. rock on/"
5,The Perfect Astral Tourguide,"If you are more creative and imaginative than practical, then Flying Without a Broom is definitely worth reading. It shows you the more wonderful, more magical side of the astral world. The exercises and guided tours inside have given me more than enough of a start to go wherever in the universe I want. My results have been wonderful, and yours should be, too!"
2,Um...,"Maybe it's just me, but i did not GET this book. I did not think that it helped in astral projection at all. it tried to get you to travel to the places the author thought you should go. I was truly confused as to why I ever bought it."
3,WHAT A TRIP,"And here we go. I guess I envy D.J.Conway a little bit for her faboulus trips. I had OBE-Experiences but up to now, it was more a helpless stumbling around on this plane. After reading about the great places to visit and the spiritual teachers, I asked myself: What am I doing wrong? Even with her techniques I didnt get that far by now.I tried some of the oil-recommandations but it only made my dreams very lucid.D.J.Conway writes about going back in time to visit Atlantis and Lemuria and it sounds like a fantasy novel, without a storyline. Sometimes I asked myself what kind of mushrooms she tried before (just kidding). All the places are LIKE WE EXPECT THEM TO BE (in our fantasy) and like novels and fairytales are describing them. But the book is entertaining and if I progress in my Astral-Travelling To Ms.Conways Level, or at least a little bit closer to it, than it will be a pleasure to rate this book with 5 Stars. Meanwhile its a little bit to ""spacy"" for me :-)."
3,HOLD THE PHONE,"I was told by a friend to pick this book up because it was a good read. After only reading the first couple chapters, i could tell that this book is a good read, but not very helpful. I am just beginning in astral projection, but i find that this book tends to make me feel that im doing something wrong. If you want to just waste a couple of hours, than this is the book for you."
5,It's a great CD beacuse it just is!,This is a great CD beacuse the guyz are so fine and also they are great musicians.So if you like fine guyz who can sing pick up this CD!
4,Right Made Might,"Professor Cardwardine gives his take on the most written about man in U.S. history. The professor focuses on political power--how it was formed in America the mid-part of the 19th century, how Lincoln acquired it, to what uses this power was directed. A good book.I do find it odd that in summing up, the professor says he sees Lincoln as mainly exceptional only in that he was in a very difficult job in extraordinary times. A man who had no money by birth, only a few years of formal education, who becomes president, steers his country through its greatest crisis, and writes the Second Inaugural Address--this man is not exceptional?A helpful section pointing interested readers to other books on Lincoln's era and a useful glossary of terms close this volume."
5,surveys the office as much as the man .,"Richard Carwardine's biography LINCOLN: A LIFE OF PURPOSE AND POWER has already received the prestigious Lincoln Prize and is an exceptional presentation by an Oxford historian who considers the extent of Lincoln's political career and impact and his moral and social philosophy. Carwardine uses original research to probe Lincoln's personality and objectives, providing a different set of viewpoints about the war president and his use of power during office. LINCOLN surveys the office as much as the man and is an outstanding, detailed coverage which will prove a 'must' for any researching Lincoln's life or times."
2,Psychologizing Lincoln,"Presumption presented as bold fact. I do not like others telling us the hidden thoughts and motives of others (as this book does). We barely understand ourselves. The bible says of our own hearts ""who can know it?"". Yet this writer presumes to know more about Lincolns heart than even Lincoln did. Sorry but ""No""."
5,A much needed book for todays youth!,"Today, when we see teen violence more and more present in our society, Daisaku Ikeda arrises as a beacon of hope and vision for all youth!"
2,Terrible mixes by Hex Hector and Norty Cotto...,I'm really disappointed by this release. Third CDS by Alyson and the worst. But that's are Hex Hector last mixes from what i know.... where is he gone? Norty Cotto failed with this song in my opinion. The vocals just don't fit. Only 2 stars i'm sorry.
5,Best Album In The World.,"This album is just amazing. No words can describe it. From the opening track ""Suddenly Tragic"" the CD takes hold of you and never lets you go. The riff is the definition of CKY. The lead guitar parts are unbelievable. Definately the most technical album the band has put out to date. Now not only does CKY have a riff style of their own as well as a sound of their own, but they have solos of their very own style as well. They sound incredable with all the effects, hand movements, foot movements, and such. Plus they do the one thing the many bands fail to when it comes to soloing on guitar, fit the overall mood of the song. My favorite tracks are ""Suddenly Tragic"", ""Tripled Manic State"", ""All Power To Slaves"", and ""Sniped"" if I HAD to pick four. But who am I kidding, the whole album will mesmerize you. Not one bad second on this CD."
2,Boring - Tasteless - Mundane,"Upon stumbling across this record at my local record store I really was not sure if I should purchase this album. I was a cKy fan for quite a while, but after some time all the songs get old and you start to forget about what it is exactly that you did like about them in the first place. Volume 1 was definitely a good purchase, but after all the hype from the cKy gang about IDR, listening to it, and realizing that it was nothing all that really different, I fell away and realized they were not all that different from other such bands. So, I bought it. I listened to it. It's quite ordinary. Now I'm depressed for having spent 13 dollars. I could have purchased a 12 pack of beer. So, to anyone who cares, it is nothing different from anything else. This whole ""it's a revolution"" stuff, is really just from 13 year old kids who love Bam and will listen to anything that anyone will tell them. Buy something different."
5,the best band out there,THis album rules...maybe not as immediately catchy as IDR but it is still awesome
2,my faith in the band is even dimmer on this bored with itself album,"CKY have always had a knack for make up original guitar riffs, offbeat elements (the odd keyboard effects scattered on there previous effort) and an old school aura to there music despite how repetive and simple it was mostly enjoyable. here they make that same atempt but fail.the guitar riffs arent as memorable, the rythyms are even flatter, the drumming keeps things at snooze level mid tempo, and the singing never hits the inevitable through filtered harmonies and forced catchiness, and amateruish lyrics. my big problem is the lack of anything new here. But at times its not something they couldnt of fixed but it they jsut dont hit the traget as much this time around. Tehy should spent more time making this album. and stop making your stupid videos and pay attention more to the music!!"
1,Chad Ginsburg = LOL,"From the band who used to shout ""F--- choruses!"" comes a cd full of them. And to anyone who boasts about how great their self production is; all the production in the world couldnt save Deron's mediocre vocals that get old after the 2nd track.The guitar riffs are slowed down metal, the drums are okay at best, and the vocals suck. Now they claim they are forcing change and anyone who knows my opinion knows I think theyre just enforcing a horrible trend.This is mediocre music by a mediocre band with a gimmick of revolutionizing the music industry. The only CKY cd you need to hear is Volume 1, IDR they sold out, and with this release they go straight down the toilet bowl.Please dont waste your money, there are many other worthy cds here that amazon offers at a cheap used price. Get 2 awesome cds instead of this piece of garbage."
1,Save Money...Buy ALOL,"If you have the first two CKY CD's just save your money. This sounds just like the last two in fact I thought the song ""Familiar Realm"" was a riff from the last CD. I'll save you some money...burn it from a friend.If you want a great CD to listen to...go buy, A Life Once Lost new CD ""Hunter"" and rock the Sh%t out of that."
2,Boring.,"Volume 1 and IDR are probably two of the best hard rock albums I own, They had a sound that was all their own. This sounds like a watered down IDR. After hearing Deron and Chad hype this album up as much as they did, I was expecting nothing short of perfection. Somehow they managed to make an entire album without making any songs stand out from the rest. You won't find and Disengage the Simulators or Flesh into Gears, but rather you'll just end up finding yourself listening to what seems like a bad parody of Infiltrate.Destroy.Rebuild."
1,THE demise of CKY,"[...] This band has lost something immensely, and im not talking about Vern, their old bass player. I Put this cd in and played it start to finish, reading the lyrics of every song.And let me just say the lyrics are so weak and retarded. All i could say is W.T.F is this crap. 93 percent of the guitar riffs are just as lame. Im still in shock and disappointment.""An answer can be found"" is a TOTAL catastrophe..The last track on this cd sums it all up ""dont hold your breath""I guess only time will tell the future of this band. It dont look good though.I wouldnt keep this cd if you paid me the 10 bucks back i wasted on it!!!!"
5,Reveals The DuBois you Didn't Know,"Most Black History fans think they have DuBois figured out. You either hate him for his haughtiness and elitism or you love his militant stands. This collection of DuBois' writings shows that the truth was somewhere in between. We see DuBois change his mind on Marcus Garvey and the elitist ""Talented Tenth"" idea. We see DuBois evolve from Integrationism to Black Nationalism to Communism. We basically see a man who is not afraid to change his ideas and admit his errors, a very human and complex man."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book. I have read other music theory books and found them difficult to understand. Felts knows how to communicate his deep knowledge in an easy-to-understand and inspiring manner. Importantly, the book deals with one concept in each chapter, so you never feel confused by the complexity of the subject. There is the right level of details and some very good examples. Even if you might not want to reharmonize every tune--which is actually great fun to do--you learn a lot about music by studying this book, and I have noticed that leadsheets have now become much more meaningful. You will soon have an amazing number of choices to give tunes you own harmonic interpretation. You can't go wrong with this book unless you are a complete beginner!"
2,Not for serious jazz learners,"Elementary level. In jazz, the term ""reharmonization"" is generally used to refer to the process of reharmonizing an entire tune, where an existing melody is refitted with a new chord progression.I think this book is good ONLY for a beginner just starting out in learning how to reharmonize/improvise because this book does *not* include John Coltrane's multitonic reharmonization. John Novello's contemporary keyboardist book is better than this book in explaining berklee method, but I would recommend David Liebman's A Chromatic Apporoach to Jazz Harmony and Melody (Chapter VIII Reharmonization of Standards) for advanced (master level) learners."
3,"Pouco a acrescentar se voc já sabe, pouco para entender se no.",Este livro tenta ser pragmático. O autor se enrola demais no comeo - onde é fácil - e se aprofunda de menos do meio até o final - onde é matéria mais difícil para os alunos. Nem é a beleza do pragmático American Way e nem profundo como os alemes. Mas vale à pena entender a viso didática da Berklee.This book tries to be pragmatic. The author is in the wind too early - which is easy - and that deepens from less than half by the end - where it matters more difficult for students. Neither is the beauty of the pragmatic American Way and not deep as the Germans. But is a good way to understanding the vision of didactic Berklee.
1,I would not recommend it !,"There are some mistakes about harmony theory in the book which could make students confusing . Example: Page #46 - ""B7 was included as Original Diatonic Chord in C Major"" - No one could get this chord using the C Major scale bacause (Ab) does not exist in the scale . Therefore it is not an Original Diatonic Chord."
3,Good refresher,"This book is a pretty useful refresher of things you probably already know. I imagine it coming in handy when a composer is in a bad rut (to the point of having a difficult time reinventing the theme with any harmonic difference). Still, a good read and is likely to force some (very restricted) composers out of ""the box""."
5,61 inch TV,"I could not be more pleased with the TV. I had to customize the sound to suit my hearing deficiencies, which says nothing about the TV. Now I only wish I could buy a Blu-Ray DVD Player and some Blu-Ray DVDs to take advantage of the full capabilities of the set. The TV fits our family rm to a tee."
3,poor quaility inspection,"The purchase of our new 61"" LED Samsung rear projection TV went smoothly and the delivery took less time than estimated by a full 7 days. Delivery was efficient and scheduled when it was convenient to us. The TV was in beautiful shape, no dings or dents. Five days later the TV just quite working. I must say that I called Samsung that evening and they promptly put in a work order, gave me the name of the repair company and their phone number. I called the repair company the next day (they hadn't gotten the work order yet) and they were prompt in picking it up and in a week we had it back working. Apparently it had a faulty DMD Module as well as a faulty ballast power supply. Hopefully, this is the last of our problems, but it should not happen to a new TV."
3,"Samsung HLT6187S 61"" Slim LED Engine 1080p DLP HDTV","Yesterday I received my Samsung HLT6187S from Amazon. The TV is working a few minutes then the screen went total black just have sound only. Lucky for me. The Eagle Freight still around to make sure the TV is working before they leave. I contacted the Amazon's customer support. They are very helpfull. They will ship me another TV. In the meantine, the Eagle Freight picked the defected TV with them. I am waiting my new TV. This is the first time I ordered a big item online. Amazon will let me know in 24 hours. Hopefully I get my TV soon without any problems. I gave 3 stars because the TV is defected."
1,Regret buying this tv online,I ordered the televion three weeks ago and it worked for one day. The video went out but I had audio. It has been in the shop ever since! The worst $2500 I've ever spent!
5,Exceptional Value -- Fantastic Picture,"We had the 51"" older version of this TV -- the one that required the bulb change -- and loved it. I expected this to be basically the same, but larger. WRONG! The picture is incredible -- almost 3D and with Blue Ray DVD's it's beyond awesome. The Amazon price was exceptional and the ease of set-up was surprising. We couldn't be happier with this tv."
5,Samsung TV,We recently purchased this TV and we are delighted with it's performence. The picture is excellent and the unit itself is very pleasing to the eye.
3,Good for 3 years,"Had this TV for 3 years and the picture no longer comes on. For the three years before this, I was very pleased as it boots up fast, great DLP clarity and works as advertised.In researching why my TV no longer works, I noticed there is a trend for the Red LED to be replaced. My issue is likely due to a LED driver. Most likely cost to repair is around $400-$500.I did not purchase the extended warranty which is my own fault. The fact that a TV which claims 20K plus hours on the LED DLP engine not lasting 6K hours is worrisome.I have purchased the Mitsubushi WD-65638 with great results so far. Will likely buy the 73 inch version next. No more Samsung for me."
1,White Dots,"I purchased TV back in July 2007. Now white spots are appearing all over the screen. I found that this is due to a widespread problem with the DLP chips. The repairs are about $600 from an authorized Samsung repair shop. However you can do it yourself for about $180. The chips themselves are about $170 plus a few bucks more for some thermal paste.Anyways I am pretty disappointed by this TV and in Samsung. A 5 year life for a $2400 TV just doesn't seem right. Sadly I recommended this TV and other Samsung products to others - Hopefully my friends won't experience similar problems.Just as an FYI the white spot problem is prevalent across several models. Some models are covered for out-of-warranty repairs by Samsung. So its worth calling in if you are experiencing this problem with a different model. In addition, if you have this model call in anyways - I am thinking if there are enough reports Samsung may include this model in their list of TVs that are covered for the white spot issue."
5,If you want WOW!...,"then this is the one for you. If you like to watch sports, the motion is smooth and clear. Movies, the colors are true & bright, and the black level is excellent. My kids play XBOX 360 on it and say they feel like they are really in the game. Had a bunch of family over for Thanksgiving, and other than coming back for dinner, I seemed to lose everyone to the basement for most of the day. I think I sold 3 more of these that day.Convenience factors are a plus too: inputs on the side of the back, adn on screen menus are easy to use. I'm looking for a smaller set for the bedroom, and I'm sticking with samsung."
5,I love this TV,I looked long and hard before deciding to buy this TV. If money were no object I would have probably bought a comparably sized LCD tv but that would have cost at least twice [maybe 3 times] the price of this set. The only benefits to an LCD are the flatness for wall mounting and viewing angle. Neither of these issues affect me so I am really happy with the tv. The picture is great. It displays my computer via hdmi really well. And the built in sound is very good as tv's go. It has all the needed inputs and outputs to do just about anything you might want to. I also really like the fact that I dont have to deal with bulb replacement.
1,Sony is better with less troubles,I went thru 2 of these sets with the blue halo issue and the (((((((()))))))) problem on the screen. Samsung tech support was terrible and denied this was a big problem with these sets. I decided to get the Sony KDS-60A3000. The set looks better and the only problem is a slight geometry issue which was also on the Samsung and is inherent to RPTV's. Get the Sony while you can and avoid this Samsung as it has many problems.
1,Only lasted 2 1/2 years,"After 2 1/2 years the light display engine went out and will cost $1200 to fix.This is horrible, and I will never buy another Samsung product."
5,Flawlwss process!,"This Samsung 6197 is very cool. We got it today, Eagle delivered 2-3 days earlier than the expected date. They unpacked it and set it on the table for us. He waited until I turned it on and made sure it was ok. Although I haven't got DISH Network's HD setup yet, we did also purchase the OPPO 912 up-converting DVD player. It is too cool. Amazon is the greatest!"
3,GREAT TV BUT DELIVERY SERVICE BAD,"FINALLY GREAT TV...FIRST DELIVERY TV DELIVERED WITH SCREEN COMPLETELY BUSTED AND BOX IT CAME IN HAD BEEN OPENED... LOOKED LIKE I RECEIVED A TV THAT WAS SENT OUT ALREADY DAMAGED..... REPLACEMENT CAME ABOUT 10 DAYS LATER WITH ONLY 1 DELIVERY PERSON TO BRING IN THIS 61"" TV..GOOD THING I WAS HOME TO HELP BRING IT IN MY HOME AND GET IT OUT OF BOX...HAPPY THAT THIS TV WAS FINE"
3,Samsung HLT6187 Slim LED 1080 DLP HDTV,"This TV is great for the price and size. The HD picture is really sharp and we couldn't be happier with its performance.We do not like the picture quality of non-HDTV broadcast. A technician has been here, updated software but no real improvement in the quality. If you are going to buy any HDTV make sure you have them show you a non-HD broadcast."
2,Venting,I was happy with my Samsung DLP until about 2 weeks ago. The TV started making these squeaky sounds one afternoon out of the blue. It lasted about 30 minutes then went away. Two nights ago it came back. Then last night I tried to turn it on and it was dead. I've only had it for 3 months! Now I have to wait a week for the guy to come look at it. This is my only tv so now I guess I'm not going to be watching tv for awhile. The price is right and Amazon did a good job getting it to me quickly but I would suggest buying something else. A friend of mine has a Tashiba and he loves his.
5,"Big picture, great value!",We bought this as a entertainment TV for our new place. The delivery was earlier than expected and the television came intact and undamaged. Which is good considering the size of the box. The TV was lighter than it looks and 2 of us got it into place easily. Turned it on and BAM! Beautiful picture and sound. Have really enjoyed this and recommend Samsung products across the board.
2,Dont buy samsung dlp.,"I have this Samsung DLP rear projection after 3 or 4 years is having problems. First when plugged in now, the screen will show picture(which is good), but after 30s or 1min, the picture will turn into 2 dozen horizontal lines of garbled picture for 2 seconds, then the picture will change to green screen, then to blank(or black) screen) and the back to a good picture. Meanwhile the tv will not respond to the remote except for in a 1 second window(then the channel can be changed). I have another problem with another Samsung tv in the past. They like other manufactures are using bad parts and not talking responsibility for their Tvs. Samsung are not the only ones who have this problem. The reason my parents picked the tv because of their picture, which looks great, when it works.Samsung has a recall but not for this type of problem described above.Now I dont know which manufacture to trust. Sony has had similar problems and their picture is not as good. Who else is there?"
2,Not Good for off angle viewing,"Do not buy this TV if you have any seating that is at an angle. The TV is best for viewing straight on at eye level. We bought this TV and put in on a mantel that is at eye level standing up. The picture is amazing when we are standing up or if we watch it from our kitchen, which is 12 feet away. But from our Sofas which are at an angle ( 45 from the center), the screen dims significantly. Also if we sit down on chairs in front of the TV, the screen dims. We are going to return this TV and get an LCD TV which is smaller than this but is better from all viewing angles.Update: We bought this TV from Best Buy and returned it to get Samsung 52 LCD HDTV from Amazon. The Samsung 52"" LNT5271F LCD tv from Amazon. The LCD TV now has vertical bar or dead pixels and I am trying to get Amazon to exchange the LCD. Amazon wants me to contact Samsung to get the issue fixed. In best buy we returned it with no questions asked. I wish Amazon provided me with a similar service."
4,No optical audio out with HDMI!,"For those of you looking forward to using the audio optical output to connect to your receiver, beware that the 87 series will only output HDMI audio to the standard audio jacks. You would need to look at the 89 series to get optical out with HDMI."
1,Service?,"I am having serious problems with my recent purchase. I had the TV delivered hooked it up to all my devices' and nothing. A little sound was made but no contrast on the black screen. No menu, no volume, nothing. I called the seller twice and was put on hold for more then 20 min each time. I tried calling them today to confirm my exchange and all I get is a busy signal. I am really not happy and hope to get a now WORKING tv soon. I called Samsung and they say about 8% of these models that go out are completely defective. Buyer beware."
3,Bad out of the Box,Within one day I was on the phone with Samsung Service. That in itself was not an easy task. The TV was down for almost two weeks. As for Amazon purchase and shipping. That was great. Received the TV sooner that I expected.
5,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"""Play It Again, Sam"" is a charming, insightful, well-written novel. Sam Rutgers, its main character, finds strength she never knew she had and a freedom she never knew she wanted while wending her way through the unexpected obstacle course that life has placed before her. I found myself rooting for her as I would for a friend or sister and relating to her as a woman with a world of choices--if only she can muster the courage. It was a smooth, fun read--thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend it."
5,Fantastic,I was so excited about his toy - my nephew is a really huge Superman fan and I ordered this to give to him for Christmas. He loved it and I was extremely pleased with how much fun everyone had with it. Thank you!
2,Junk,"I thought this would be fun, but ended up in garbage after 2 days. Fighters dont stay in place and dont really move well. Very hard to hit at other player"
3,Superman always win,"My child liked it, because he always wants to play superman and superman always wins.(it seems to be designed that way). By the way, it is difficult to hold the controller for long time."
2,Dont make'em like they use to ...,"Dude this looks cool but plays crappy -pretty cheap plastic, mechanics are lame. You cant really tell when Superman is hit because his head barely leans back. You have to constantly adjust the arm positions of the figures so their reach can strike the head or chest targets -and it seems rigged that Supermans arms are just a little longer to stack the odds for truth, justice and the American way. Again, Cool figures weak cheap playability."
2,God as ideologue,"I bought this book for my son thinking it was a serious work discussing serious religious issues. It is not. It is a political treatise with a smattering of religiosity (two stars for the smattering). It is unfortunate to find another Christian minister whose political agenda is so intertwined with his faith that he cannot distinguish between them -- whether a Wm Sloane Coffin or a Pat Robertson.One must be extraordinarily cynical to preach to a ""young doubter"", as Coffin does, that a particular political ideology is a prerequisite to following Jesus Christ. This book has little to offer serious seekers. Christian parents, progressive and evangelical, should refer their children elsewhere for answers to their doubts."
2,Do not Exceed 10 pounds....,"1.Hollow plastic snapped together2.10 pound max weight......C'mon.3.Pricey for the above.4.But....grip diameter is perfect5.Strap rocks.I'd avoid this, unless you would rather do more reps than weight."
5,Excellent for wrists and forearms... I use it several ways.,"This is excellent for wrists and forearms. Based on some things I read, I actually use it several ways:- I hold the horizontal bar (at arms length), going up one way, and then down ... then I go up the other way, and then down.- I hold the edges so my palms are facing to the sides instead of down while holding the bar (like turning a jar cover), going up one way, and then down ... then I go up the other way, and then down.I have only been using 5 pounds and have been getting a great burn quickly. I think it likely it can hold 10-20 pounds without much of an issue. Perhaps would like a stronger one (metal instead of plastic) for the future, though. I like the stability of the strap instead of a rope on other ones, though I have not used those admittedly."
5,Perfect winding balance,This is the one and only wrist roller that actually winds up the middle without shifting around and making one arm work more than the other.
2,mysteriously badly recorded,"As much as I love Gong, I can't recommend this. It's really a collection of odds and ends, many of them very poorly recorded indeed. When I say ""odds and ends,"" I really mean it; for example, the version of ""Tried So Hard"" here sounds as if it was recorded by a cassette off a television speaker. And do you really need re-recordings of the little gnome voice saying ""Gong! La planete gong!"" from the beginning of Camembert Electrique?Unless you're an absolute fanatic who must have every beep and bleep Gong recorded, you can probably live without this. I've had this for a number of years and I don't listen to it that often at all."
3,Gong - 'Mystery & History Of ...' (Thunderbolt),"This is it, the one-disc pressing I was talking about in my review right below THIS one. Total of twenty-one tracks of bits and pieces by none other than the glissando guru Daevid Allen himself and crew. For old school Gong fans only."
2,Poor design destined to fail catistrophically,"I purchased this trapeze bar for my kids. It failed after about 18 months. One of the rings snapped off the bar under the load of an 80 lb. kid. The rings appear sturdy enough, but the eyelet that attaches the ring to the trapeze bar is the weak point that failed. Fortunately no one was injured. The retailer would not replace it and the manufacturer stated that 'accessory' parts to the paysets they make are only warranted for 1 year. Buyer beware!"
5,fits the bill perfectly on our swingset,Got this to replace an old one that came with our play set 6 yrs ago. My son just loves it! He using it every time he goes on the play set. Simple to set up & has been standing up to the elements well.
5,Essential reading for anyone interested in the oil industry and resource economics,"I first read this book in 1996 and consider it to be the most useful book I have ever read on the oil industry. If you want to understand the basics of resource economics, risk sharing and rent sharing (taxes vs profits), no book will serve you better.Don't be put off by the fact that the book was published in 1994 (and as far as I can tell, has not been updated since). This is a book about core principcles that works as well in a $100/bbl as a $10/bbl world."
5,Enduring Ec0-Activist...In Memoria...,"At 88, he died of cancer,at Berkeley, Nov. 6th,2K. It may well be that 'his' Sierra Club will prevail- to have Lake Powell drained--making Glen Canyon 'live' again. This effort,underway in court, would take more than 8 years to drain! & be biggest enviromental restoration project ever, a precendence. A fitting tribute to founder of Earth Island Institute....we lost Carl Reisner recently,(Cadillac Desert)"
2,"Review, Encounters with the Archdruid","Encounters with the Archdruid by John McPhee was an interesting book. We read it as part of our AP Environmental Science class. Three developers encounter Dave Brower, a conservationist with the Sierra Club. The reading was easy, but at times it was hard to follow because McPhee often jumps around and talks about the scientists' families. It was often repetitive because the developers and the conservationist argue about the same issues all the time. One of the strongest points of the novel is the description of the wilderness. It is very detailed and really gives the reader a sense of actually being there. Overall, the book is unbiased. It offers people the opportunity to explore both sides of environmental issues. It's a good book to read if you're really in the mood to read it, but it's not something most people would pick up and read. -GHHS AP Environmental Students"
2,too many dam dams,"It made me want to hike the Sierra Nevada mountains. The cover of the book enticed me to read this book. The book was very informational about David Brower's life. It was good how the book was divided into three parts to makea it more interesting. John McPhee did a good job of describing how the mountains looked. It helped show how nature is affected by humans and how we shouldn't interfere with it. It was very interesting to see the differemt views of a conservationist verses a copper miner or a developer. Overall, this story has enlightened all of its readers to the effects of human growth and industrialization in the wilderness."
3,Encounters with the Archdruid,"In an AP Environmental Science Class, we were assigned to read an environmental book and do a book report. Six of us chose Encounters with the Archdruid. The main consensus was while being a very informative and descriptive book, it was boring. Being 17 and 18 year old seniors in High School, this book was not our forte due to the slow moving nature of it. This book presented 4 viewpoints of people in the enviromental world: the dam builder, hardcore enviromentalist, developer, and the miner. The dialouge between the characters is somewhat interesting, but this book is definatly not a ""Joe-Jim"" read. For an excellent environmental book I highly suggest Ishmael."
3,Encounters With The Archdruid,"Encounters with the Archdruid, by John McPhee, was interesting because it showed the progression of the battles that preservationists go through for the environment. Throughout this book, two point of views are taken, the convervationist and the preservationist. Each presents valid arguments, and at times becomes boring after a lot of the same arguments have occurred. In general, this book is easy to follow, and is recommended to people who want to learn basic opinions of protecting our environment."
2,Review of the book,"Overall, the book was dull. For example, in the Cascades, all the narrator does is describe the scenery and write down what Brower says. It was more like a biography than a story. Also, the layout was very coarse. It's as if the narrator wrote down anything he remembered. One good thing about this book was that hte decriptions of nature were very detailed. We do not reccommend the book unless someone really wants to know about conservation and conservationist views."
3,hello,"Part one is very informative. It talks alot about the characters, their personalities, and their backgrounds. We didn't like the fact tahtcopper"" and ""mine"" was in just about every other sentence. IN part, we believe the author was trying to emphasize about the characters' obsession and how strongly each man felt for his argument, however it made the section extreemly boring, long, and hard to read. In the second sectoin, the story line picked upi. We enjoyed how throught the novel, the author would continuely add depth and different demensions to the characters with more background information about each characer. Part three was definatly the most enteretaining out of the three with it's fast paced storyline and action scenes. The beginning of the book was slow but then it picked up and ended well."
1,Encounters with a bad book,This book is not very interesting. It is very jumpy and hard to understand. There are many enviormental issues that are barely if at all touched on by the author. Characters are over developed and there is to much background information on unimportant characters. Brower is just on big whinner. Overall it is not that good of a book.
1,Encounters with the alcoholic,"Encounters with the Archdruid is an out-drawn, boring biography about David Brower. The three sections are repetitive and have no important facts about conservationists. The entire book is full of pointless arguements that usually end with Brower getting drunk. The reader can not even fully understand the opinions of Brower or the other characters because it is all being told by an unidentified narrator. This book is a waste of time and doesn't tell any stories of interest."
1,Have to be updated!!!,This book have to be updated with the new technologies. I do not recommend it! It will be useless to me!
4,"Great portable for consumers, with the Best OS!","I have the 800 mhz model, and I have to say it's a great machine. Light in weight (I can hold it in one hand easily), fast, and super sleek. The operating system, OS X, is fantastic: powerful, beautiful, and it doesn't crash! The book comes with quite a bit of software, and despite what someone else wrote here it DOES run RealPlayer just fine, as well as display web pages properly. It comes with AppleWorks which can open and save in the Word format, so that is a non-issue.It plays DVD's perfectly, and iTunes 4 burns CD's as fast as my external FireWire drive. If the speakers were just a bit better (i.e. as good as the legendary Pismo model), I would give this Mac 5 stars.BTW, before relying on a Windows user for info about Macs, talk to a knowledgeable dual platform user such as myself. You'd find the stuff you hear (they are slow, over priced, Apple is dying, etc.) is just not true."
3,This should actually be 3.5 stars...,"I enjoyed this book but I still have a few complaints...There were only 2 stories within, but they were both kinda long so I guess that's OK. But my real complaint is that if this is the '3rd and last' book of Cowboy Bebop, then why doesnt it have a proper ending? That kinda annoys me...oh well.Now on to the good points. Although the second story 'Fight for your RIght' didnt interest me that much, the first, 'What's your number', was so beautiful it touched me in a way I never felt again until reading book 4 of Chobits when Manager Ueda tells his story about his persocom.This sweet little story is about Ed being reunited with 'Tomato', (and you thought that was just her COMPUTER'S name, huh?) and all the trouble they go through to outsmart a government conspiracy to block the earth from the net using a virus that they created themselves 3 years ago.I just wish that happened in the anime..."
2,Seiko Men's Alarm Chronographic Titanium Watch,"I purchased this watch for my Husband, but it was TOO bulky, showy and heavy. He did not like it at all. It is not good for every day use either."
4,Good solid value,"This is a quality product. Just as good as products costing half-again as much as far as I can tell. Adjustments are easy. I'm 5' 6"" and can easily reach all areas of the roof on the middle adjustment.D.Bone claims it's overpriced and maybe the one that costs half as much (yes, I found it) would be just as good. I got free shipping on this one and the shipping on the cheaper one was more than the step! Would've cost about the same as what I paid for this.This is a well made product which I can definately recommend."
1,Excellant Product BUT overpriced,Well made product but overpriced. Too late but I found a comparable product for half the price. Keep shopping.
3,It's an acid trip.,"Throughout the whole thing, it feels like reality is being covered by a layer of warped glass. The two exceptions are the clinic waiting room near the beginning, and the hospital near the end, which feel out of place amongst all the surreal imagery. Maybe there's some kind of underlying message in the fact that the two most normal scenes take place in institutions of wellness. But this trip is way too far out for me to figure out something like that. A compelling curiosity rather than serious literature."
3,Weird.,"If you've read other books by Abe, you may like this one. I found it less cohesive than his other works. Just....weird. The radish sprouts on the protagonist's shins was cool. The children chanting ""Help me please"" gave me the creeps."
4,Kangaroo Notebook: A Novel trip,Kangaroo Notebook: A Novel is a great weekend read! Abe combines a Jacob's Ladder (the movie) feel with Burroughs' The Naked Lunch. A must-have for any fan of Eastern culture.
2,.,"Okay, I'll give you a wonderfully imaginative and playful premise. And understand that I am a fan of strange literature. But I just couldn't get through this one, somehow. It was interesting for a few pages, but then over the next few dozen, it just became *too* nonsensical. I don't mind nonsensical things in general, but ... I don't know ... I can't figure it out ... but this one just bored me to tears. Shrug."
1,Read it and weep -- if you paid for this book,"Stop right now! If you're contemplating the purchase of this book, put the thought out of your mind and move on. This slim paperback should never have made it to the manuscript stage. If you can get past the typos, poor grammer, and sloppy dictation -- because surely someone read this into a tape recorder then had it typed by a fool -- you will find nothing of substance that couldn't be gained from an article in the Sunday newspaper real estate section. I'm shocked that Amazon.com would even bother to list it, it's that bad. I'm returning it. Please don't even get that far!"
3,THE BROKER INFLATION FACTOR,"The author makes a good case for Real Estate Brokers significantly adding to the escalation of housing prices and the lightening of your wallet. An Appendix on Bankers, their hidden costs, points, high interest rates should be added to the next printing.The book is a basic primer for FSBO sales. The author's major argument is savings on the house by selling it yourself. Perhaps he could also emphasize the feeling of accomplishment by doing it yourself. I also found some positive points for the wouldbe homeowner turned seller: factors of house inflation, reviewing your home, and newspaper advertising ... points that help a seller to think!I am keeping the work because I really like the size, cover, printing and color. My compliments to the publisher and printer. There is an old sales adage ... everything eventually sells if promoted!"
5,"Fantastic album , Wonderfull Guitarplaying A True Classic","This is Al's best album , and as such a fantastic guitar-tour-de-force. Reviewer 'MTV Rocks' has his ears filled withs**t , period."
5,Obviously a classic,"THis CD is a classic, and Al Dimeola is one of the greats. Considered by most who know great music to be his essential CD. MTV-rocks is either incredibly brilliant for his sarcasm, or incredibly stupid, because, well,read his reviews (also essential). I'd hate to think that this view of good taste is where the music biz is going, jeez, so I prefer to think of him as the ""weird al"" of online reviewers :)."
5,"Maestro, 5 stars are not enough","I bought this album when 18, just guided by the cover. I was trying to play the guitar, so anything that sounded 'guitar' was good for me. I never learned to play the guitar, but I met Al's most valuable album ever : Elegant GipsyThe album is instrumental I know. Is there any need for singing? Definitively not. A voice just would ruin this magnificent masterpiece. I still have my old LP, it's a treasure, no doubt.Buy this album right now."
5,The Greatest Guitarist in History?,"I worship Hendrix, Beck, Page, Metheny, Holdsworth, Vaughan, Howe, you name 'em, I've got 'em. But over 30 years later I'm still amazed at what Mr. DiMeola does on this MASTERPIECE. I HATE awards and awards shows and polls but if I HAD TO CHOOSE(gun to my head) I would pick Al as the greatest ever and present Elegant Gypsy as exhibit # 1."
4,Neither flamingo music nor flamenco,"The correct term would be fusion. I read an interview with Al Dimeola where he lamented that this period of his career was devoted to attempting to be the fastest guitarist in the world (at the expense of deeper emotional development.) If the energy derived from youthful competitiveness is what you're after, this album is for you. This is a poor copy of flamenco if flamenco is what you're after, but for Paco de Lucia fans, his inclusion provides another interesting version of his ""entre dos aguas"" in ""mediterranean sundance"", and his presence and soul carry the theme of the album as evidenced even by the artwork."
5,An Early Inspiration,"I was 13-14 years old when I first heard this in the late 70s and it had a huge influence on my burgeoning guitar playing. I saw him live with essentially this band minus Jan Hammer as well as with Paco and John on the ""Night in San Francisco"" tour, awesome stuff. I owned all his albums through the eighties, after that he mellowed and I went in different directions, but this is still my favorite of his, one of my favorite albums of all time and a timeless fusion classic, not to be missed!"
3,Kind of a let-down,"This book is supposedly centered on the writings of Posidonius, a Syrian-Greek philosopher who traveled widely through Celtic lands shortly before the rampages of Julius Caesar. The problem is: the writings are lost and Freeman is working from second-hand fragments. While the book is interesting, generally, I felt that it was a bit of a let-down. You buy it thinking your going to get this unique first-hand account when it's really just a synthesis of other already familiar sources. It should be titled ""An Introduction to the Celts"" There's very little by the ""Philosopher"" and even less about the Druids."
4,required reading,"To be honest with you, I had to read it for a class and I kinda got into the story, it was easy to follow..."
5,Tha Mexakinz would scare the hell out of Limp Bizkit!!!,"This group is known for their crazy hip hop, so was shocked to hear them blowing up with the alternative stylie competing with groups like Rage Against The Machine on this record. Live instruments, with hard guitars and a Latin ska/punk feel, and somehow they never lose their hip hop credibility anywhere in the record - these kids are tight! The single, ""Rain on Your Parade"" is as good as anything out there. If you want to hear where music is headed, check this CD out."
5,A TREMENDOUS TASK FROM A GREAT FRIEND,"I bought the four volume book as soon as the books came of the press. My telephone bill immediatley went through the roof as I conversed via land line with Harve in Wisconsin. Harve did a super job with these books, his research was numba one bar none. The writing is superb, the wit is there as are the heroes who did the job that did not exist. I will surely miss this fine friend. Sua Sponte, buddy"
3,cosmic dude,i felt a bit like the guy who doesn't do the acid at the party .some great insightful and wise storiesand some trippy 'smoked to much weed with those mushies' stories.i love kampion's stylejust this one not quite my tasteif your a voddo child of the 60's you'll love itpeace
4,"Transformation, not Information.",Let's face it folks - We are never in control. Events just happen and our attitude shapes our life regardless of situations. There is only the oneness split into positive and negative polarity. Ride the surf.
5,Get This Book,"If you consider yourself to be a spiritual seeker - get this book. This is the most clear and practical account of genuine awakening that I have ever read, having read a lot of them, and the experience of just going through the book itself has practically turned my mind inside out. My mind is still spinning from it. Get this book"
5,withstood the test of time,"This simple rule is as usefull today as it was 1500 years ago. No matter what your position in life, following some or all of these principles will help simplify your life. It will help you to re-discover God's presence. Simple wisdom that has stood the test of time."
5,Eye opening,"I actually picked this book up at a yard sale. I love what she had to say so much I bought copies for all the ladies in my Sunday school class. This book isn't as much a how to(I think there are plenty of those)but why. Our homes are a ministry to those around us. The author really challenges alot of what we ""think"" hospitality is. There is too much to understand(at least for me) in one reading. I see why it can be used as study. I intend to buy copies for all my girls (We have 5 daughters and one daughter-in-law). There is a serious need for the teaching in this book and I'm glad it is in print. Thank you Karen Mains for listening to God and sharing with the rest of us."
3,Disappointing,"I had read positive reviews of this book on a number of sites, but I was disappointed. There is very little practical, specific information in the book. There's a lot of vague talk about Biblical reasons to become more hospitable, and different types of hospitality (from welcoming home family members to fostering children), but very little specific advice about how to carry out this hospitality.I could sum up everything I got out of this book in five pages or less."
2,Did not love it,The lady seemed to really really like herself and her view points seemed very radical...in a way that would not be safe for families...
5,LIKE TO FISH? THIS IS GREAT!,"This book covers all those fishing spots within a day trip of Washington, DC. A great read for all those places they cover which you would never know about otherwise. My 12 year old son and I found several great spots from this detailed read!"
1,"No Floss, A Toothpick","This is labeled a ""floss-pick"" but it is a plastic, pliable toothpick. It has no floss (string). My teeth are tight so this item does not remove anything in-between my teeth. It is does provide gum massage. This is also a non-returnable item to Amazon (catigorized as a ""grocery"" item)."
3,MI5.,"This book was obviously written by a woman. Aside from that, I do not think I am that dumb to consider this as atrue account of the life of the Director-General of MI5. Do not get me wrong; the book is very well written, andcertainly worth reading; however, to insult readers that this kind of picturesque English life is what theDirector-General of MI5 has, is asking a bit too much."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"I can certainly understand why a few women, as well as (possibly) a few men, might not like the protagonist, Tracy, in this wonderful novel of Voodu, adventure and love. After all, she is brave, resourceful, intelligent, well-read and traveled, speaks several languages, and is quite open-minded. And not so very frightened of spiders and things with ""too many legs"". Of course these qualities are completely unbelievable for a woman to possess, especially when combined with logic and reasoning, and therefore the entire book should be dismissed as ""a waste of money"". However, my only regrets in buying this book are that it isn't available in hardcover or in French."
2,"Great Title, Disappointing book","Being someone who devours anything written regarding Haiti, I was excited to read ""Bones Become Flowers"", but was soon skipping entire passages as the author became mired in description that did nothing to further the story. Also there are times when an author can believably write from the other gender's perspective and get it right, unfortunately this was not the case here. It was pretty obvious that the author was a male, not in tune with what a 30+ female thinks, feels, admires etc.The most disappointing thing was the ending. In all honesty, ""Bones Become Flowers"" was a waste of money."
4,Bacarra's new hits,"This album is just the same as Bacarra's greatest album, with the exception of the two new songs ""Woman To Woman"" & ""Heart, Body & Soul."" the two new songs are alright but they are not written by Rolf and his partner that I can't remember, who wrote the original songs. The good thing is that the original girls Matje & Maria are here to sing all of their hits when they were together. It is unfortunate that this group broke up because when Matje decided to get other people to sing with her, it was not the same when they did the original hits as ""Yes, Sir I can boogie"" & Sorry I'm a lady! If you like Baccars you can add this to your collection. but your best bet is to get the 3-disc ultimate set with everything they released with M&M."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T BUY A SHARK. IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. IT HAS TO BE THE WORST PURCHASE THAT I HAVE EVER MADE. YOU CANNOT CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER. SMART MOVE ON THEIR PART, THEIR PHONE SYSTEM WOULD BE OVERLOADED WITH COMPLAINTS."
2,no good!!!,I bought this because I heard it was powerful and cheap.Yes! it's true that it's cheap and easy to carry.. butit's not enough to get dust and hair from the carpet..This vacuum is the weakness machine in the world!!!
3,NOT CORDLESS,"While the sucking capabilities seem to be fine for cleaning my car, my intended use, I'm not sure how where the PORTABLE component comes into play, as it is not cordless. If I had payed more the 4 bucks for it I would be pissed."
2,works ok but bad warranty.,"I bought this for $5 and while it did an ok job at picking up little things, it did after only a handful of uses. I was considering sending it back to get a new one, but the Euro-Pro warranty requires you to send them $8.95 to cover shipping. That's more than I paid, and frankly, more than I think it's worth. The Mini Turbo Shark is now sleeping with the fishes."
1,What a mess!!,"I bought this little vacuum to replace my broken Eureka Mighty Mite. The Shark is extremely loud and doesn't have enough suction power to pick up dirt under my potted plants. Furthermore, after finally getting some smaller dirt particles picked up, I put the machine on the floor and it burped back up all of the dirt I had just tried to suck up. This is a piece of junk that I am returning to the store today."
4,Good Things Come In Small Packages,"Living in the desert, dust is a fact of life and cleaning it can be a full time job in itself. I purchased this cute little vac through a special offer and have been very pleased.It is not intended to be the main vac, but it is great for doing small jobs such as window sills, around the edge of the room and around furniture legs where the big vac misses that last inch or so. I also used this vac to clean my furniture and was very pleased with the results. It easily reaches into small corners and crevices.This baby vac has tremenous power, a long cord, and an easy on/off switch. It is light weight and fits comfortable in the hand. The collection bin is small and needs frequent emptying, but I placed a trash can in the middle of the room while cleaning which saved time and many steps.Keep in mind this is a little bitty vac intended for minor jobs and quick clean ups and you won't be disapointed.I give it two thumbs up and rate it a good value for the small price."
3,Handy But Too Little Capacity,"It's a powerful little vacuum that I can easily cart around the house. It's especially great at cleaning ceiling fans with the long hose and brush attachment. However, it has a tiny holding vessel and is filled to capacity so quickly. It's kindof a hassle to keep stopping in the middle of sucking up a spill just to empty it. Forget using it in the car, you'd be better off lugging out the big vac."
3,Only because it was on sale,"I got this vacuum because it was on special for a dollar. For the price I paid it does a good job. I am amazed at the power this litle vac has, however there are some problems. The hose is way to short, you have to get the motor so close to what ever you are sucking up that the exhaust just blows it around. I was also disappointed in the size of the collection canister. It fills up way to fast. All in All not a bad deal, but I would never pay full price."
1,I gave it a star because I couldn't give it none,This thing would be worth more if you could recycle the cardboard box it comes in and sell it for scrap. This thing immediately loses suction and it is terrible. I would never spend money for it. Good thing it was free.
4,I know this is kind of gross,"...but after a stuggle with ants, the exterminator came to visit - my land lord let them into my apartment. I could not believe what I saw when I got home - dead ants everywhere! You mean to tell me they don't clean up the dead ants? So much for service. But Mini Turbo Shark came to the rescue. This thing was powerful enough to pick up all of the ants - and fast. I had the whole gross thing over with in less then 7 minutes for my whole apartment. The Shark is also great for the car, for picking up a pile of swept crumbs (I don't like using the dust pan) and a lot of other quick clean ups."
3,It's okay,"I purchased this item for five bucks, so basically you pay what you get. I think this is great for a quick pick-ups especially if you have young children. This is certainly not intended for major cleaning events or to replace your vacuum. It picked up the plaster, dust and crushed cereals, so no complaints there. The up-side is that I can finally vacuum the stuff out of my keyboards. The down-side is that the gadget gets very hot after prolonged use."
1,Disappointing,"We received this vac as a housewarming gift, and I thought that it was great the first 3 times I used it. Then the attachments would not stay on during use, it lost suction, and it died the 4th time I used it. This product was seriously disappointing. My dyson vaccume has such great attachments that I will never use a handheld like this one again."
5,great value for a great vacuum,"was skeptical because it was so cheap and was thinkingprolly it's the suck cos it's NOT cordlessbought 6 nonetheless and am pleasantly surpriseit's great for small clean ups around the computer desk(crumbs, cat hair, dust) and comes w/ alot of different attachments"
2,Okay for spot cleaning...,"I, as well, got this thing for a buck. If I had paid full price, I would've been pissed, but it does come in handy once in a while. It's good for sucking up dust bunnies and little pieces of kitty litter that are always a problem at my place, but I would never use it for anything bigger than a door mat. Don't get it if what you really need is a full sized vacuum cleaner, and certainly don't buy it for full price."
1,Not for your car,"I bought this unit for car vacuuming. Receive it today and find it is corded, not a portable vacum.What do you expect for $8, right? At least Amazon could have stated in its specification about the cord, so I don't have to waste both time and money because of their insufficient info."
1,Infomaterial Material,"I guess we all should learn to avoid whatever is sold on TV! I bought this as a 2nd vacuum, to get the dust from corners & other such small jobs. Unfortunately, while it is light & easy to carry, that's the only good thing about it. It has no power whatsoever, and even if you beg and plead, it wont pick up pet hair from carpet. Don't get this vacuum, unless all you're looking to clean is big easy things like cheerio's from the kitchen floor!"
3,power cord limits portability,"Just be aware that this unit must be plugged into a wall socket, it is not cordless. You may need an extension cord to use it in your car for example. This is somewhat surprising because it limits the portability of this otherwise small unit."
3,Strong suction but not reliable,"This thing does have a strong suction but you have to be really close to dirt or area you want to suck. I used it mostly to clean my car. It does a a pretty good job at getting the cracks but gets really hot if you leave it on too long. Few weeks ago it died on me when I was cleaning my car. I guess it just got too hot and burned out. Total hour of use is around 5 hours. If you have one, I suggest you don't leave it on for long period of time. Maybe 15 min at a time and let it cool down. I dont' think I'm going to buy another one. I'm going to open it up and see if it's just a fuse I can replace."
1,Sleek Appearance and Powerful Name are Deceptive!!!!,"This was one of the biggest purchase disappointments I've ever made. The life span of this product in my home was only about 60 days so I returned it and got a new one hoping it would last longer. (I figured that it was an unique situation.) I figured wrong. The second one lasted only about 90 days and then died completely. I called the manufactuerer and they suggested I get a new battery for it. Unless you're interested in spending time and money on a product that is supposed to be a time and money saver, I suggest you, cautious shopper, shop for a different product."
1,Beware keep your money in your pocket,"This is one of the loudest portable hand held vacuum cleaners I have ever used. If you do decided to buy it use ear plugs as I feel you could actually loose your hearing from prolonged use of this device. I just threw mine in the trash about an hour ago, $40 in the trash."
2,loud,"Long cord and reasonably good suction. Shape is awkward to use in many areas, filters are hard to find and expensive. Probably should use ear protection it's so loud. Only holds a tiny bit of dirt. attachments fall off easily."
1,useless,It definately has very strong suction but if you suck any amount of dirt it gets clogged and it's useless. i wouldn't recommend buying this.
4,"good, but doesn't hold a candle to Stories of the Spririt, Stories of the Heart","this compilation apparently replacedStories of the Spirit, Stories of the Heart: Parables of the Spiritual Path from Around the World, which is now out of print. while i can recommend them both, i strongly urge those interested in the the book being reviewed to find a used copy of the other. i remember looking for a copy as a gift for someone, and mistaking Soul Food for it. i couldn't find some of my favorite stories, which clued me in to the difference, and overall was struck by more glossiness inSoul Food: Stories ...at the cost of depth. it's worth seeking out used copies of the other. (i recommend that at some risk of depleting the supply - i continue to give away copies as gifts, over the years, and hope they don't run out!)regardless, i appreciate the good and constructive work of the authors of both books (jack kornfield the link between the two) - the best kind of work."
3,Many nice stories,"This book contains many wonderful teaching stories. It is weakened by including many stories by Forrest Carter. He wrote Little Tree, published it as fact, but was later reclassified as fiction. Check out author's story on Wikipedia."
4,You Won't Forget It,"This movie is not what we Westerners are accustomed to in movies, therefore we tend to dismiss it. We like all emotions openly displayed. lots of dialogue and the plot must be resolved.You will find none of this in this movie, but it is certainly worth viewing and once you understand the reason for the lack of interaction between characters, it does make sense.Another aspect that makes the movie difficult is the long scenes when nothing is happening on the screen. That was the director's approach.The family is totally disfunctional as a unit. The parents never speak to each other, they all eat alone, and they function in their own little worlds with virtually no emotion.Even sex is random with no emotions attached.After the encounter between the son and the father, no one speaks of it and life continues on as before. There is no resolution to anything. That is the horror of the whole movie."
3,50/50,"This is simply the kind of film that one will either like or dislike. I really can't see there being two-ways about it.It has only been a year or so since I emersed myself into the world of independent/international/arthouse/whatever you want to call it, films. The River is not for the novice!I forced myself to finish the film because I felt it was important to at least give the director's vision a chance before judging. I am glad I did. The film has no music in it, all you get is the natural ambiance of the characters surroundings. That kinda leaves a haunting echo over each scene."
2,slow agonying fast forward-button movie watching experience,"i love artistic movies...but what happened to this one? it's a strange movie indeed. viewing from an artistic point of view, it may make some sense, but with lots of forwarding. if you like slow artsy movie, watch ""scent of green papaya"" instead."
1,Another dud from an overrated director.,"...Ming-liang Tsai's films drag along endlessly with no direction and, quite frankly, no real acting. The River is a story which could have been easily and effectively told in 30 minutes, but instead it drags on for two hours. Scenes are needlessly drawn out and tell the viewer rather little. This is not avant-garde or alternative film making..."
5,Dr. Gayle Preach the WORD - Heal the Soul,This book is certainly a healer of the soul. Dr. Gayle has used therapeutic techniques as well as the Word of God to reach the heart of the people. I'm excited to see something of this magnitude in print that will literally change the lives of people who have experienced abuse at the hands of predators.Keep preaching the Word Dr. Gayle.
4,Excelent,"I already bought and used this product and thought sometimes very good, so I evaluated 4 stars. I recommend this product quietly. View tips and guidelines | 20 more words required"
4,You need more clear,"The idea behind this is a great one but in order to get all the orange peel sanded out you need another full can of clear. As I was wet sanding with 1500 grit, it went down to the color. I stopped immediately and purchased 2 more cans of clear. Now it came out looking like glass and the color does shift. I am pleased with the results and would purchase this product again."
4,"Big storm, Little map","Overall this book was riventing reading for me. Loving nature disaster stories like I do, I was glued to the pages till the storm petered out. However, I do have one complaint and that is the lack of detailed maps of the area included in the book. Anyone not familiar with the area is going to be at a loss without an atlas of the area for reference. Towns are named that mean nothing to me without a map, not to mention distances. Perhaps in further editions a good map of the area hardest hit could be included, otherwise a gripping read. Meanwhile, dear readers, read this with an atlas on your lap but do read it."
3,Amon Duul - 'Meeting With Menmachines' (Thunderbolt),"Not 100% sure,but it seems to me this is more or less another compilation CD,filled with left over tracks that never did make it on to an actual album.Oh,don't get me wrong,'Meeting...' is okay,just not great.Best tracks are the spaced out progressive ""Pioneer"" and ""Burundi Drummer's Nightmare"".Certainly not for the new AD/AD II fans,but for the followers that have at least a dozen or so of their other releases.It may be like second class krautrock,but still worthy."
1,Terrible product,"After reading all the reviews I decided to go ahead with this purchase anyway. Other reviewers warned that this would take your door right off the hinges if it was pushed too hard, but I figures, how hard can my 14th month old really push anyway? He loved to close doors and I thought these would be perfect to keep him from getting stuck in a room or losing a finger in the door. It certainly stopped my toddler from closing the door, which was great. However after only 3 uses my door started separating from the wall at the top hinge and now I don't need the door stopper at all, the door won't even close now. Hopefully we can repair/replace the hinge without too much trouble, but dont bother wiht this product. Try the Safety 1st no drill door stopper, works awesome, and I've had one in place for 6 months and absolutley no problems with that door whatsoever."
1,Not the best at all,We use these ever so often. Most of the time they fall off. We have normal sized doors and all so I don't know why they end up on the floor. I would recommend looking into other door guards. My daughter can still push the door to the point where the door meets the frame...so she could still potentially get her fingers caught in between the door.
2,Great product but absolutely not for vintage doors. Very hard on hinges.,"Let me say first, that if you have industrial steel doors or a very, very sturdy frame, then this is the finger guard for you. But I have to second the emotion of the poster who says that it takes that door right off the upper hinges. All it takes is a few times and BOOM! You have a bigger safety issue than smashed finger-you have dangly door. Totally not the fault of the product-it works. It's easy. Pops on and off. If I had a loft or newer doors maybe? But I wish I'd *really* listened to the other reviewer. If you have an older home, you might try blocking the doors open during prime baby time instead."
2,"Great teether, not a great finger guard","Super easy, yes. But, when your 11-month-old decides that he really wants that door shut, that door is going to shut, and take off the upper hinges as well. Granted, the hinges are 60 years old, but still. So, a new upper hinge later, the door works.And now we have two new teethers. Perfectly sized for little hands, I might add. The notches work well as a grip. So, for $5, we have a great new teething toy instead of a finger guard. Oh well."
3,"They work, but door can still swing a few degrees","I bought these to prevent my 16 Month old from slamming doors close. They work, door won't close, but my 16M old can still swing the door. In one ocation, my son was able to put enough pressure while attempting to close the door that it messed it up. I couldn't close the door after that, I had to adjust the hinges. So Be aware if you're toddler is strong, he/she can still try to close it. My lil one is no BAM-BAM (Flinstones) but he can still swing the door with these. After this incident, we opted for a door stop and a couple of these."
1,Pulls door hinges off the frame,"I bought these because some of the reviews said that they don't pull the hinges off the wall. I was living in a brand new condo with heavy doors. Within two days, the doors would not shut right because they were being pulled from the door frame. Would not recommend, sorry."
4,"Pretty good, but not worth $10","I bought several packs of these when our twins started walking. And they worked great and were very easy to put on/take off as needed. Since they were affordable I bought extras for the in-laws house. But after 10 months of use the rubber in them has softened up a bit (from the kids trying to close the doors) so they are not as firm and therefore allows the door to be closed further. So now we are using 2 of these per door. I thought I would come back and buy a couple of more packs, because we have lost some. But I see they are currently $10.xx for 2. I thought that seemed high for 2 small pieces of rubber, then I checked my Amazon purchase history and see that I only paid $5 for 2 of them 10 months ago. I definitely won't be buying any of these now at $10 a pair."
3,flip flops,"i was disappointed...after a month, the foam was compressed and not supportive and now a little uncomfortable. I was looking for something a little more supportive...and would last longer"
4,"Very good, somewhat supportive flip flop","I really love these sandals. I'd have given them 5 starts if they were just a bit thicker and didn't squish down so much, but I am heavy, so I hope that when I get back down to a reasonable size, they won't squish as quickly. They are quite comfortable even though they are compressed. I think, if they were just a bit thicker, I would like them even more. They have a slight support for the arch, which is nice and you don't often get with sandals like this. They make a thicker sole, but they are not flat, which I would not like. Overall, a good choice."
2,Teva Sandals run small...,"I purchased the sandals for myself but was not able to wear them because they run narrow, I even went a size up because I have wide feet.. I ended up giving them away to someone with a narrow foot.."
4,Cute and comfy,"These are really cute, and I have received many complements on them. The only complaint I have is that they are already showing a lot of wear in the sole. If you step on a rock, it is easily embedded in the shoe and you will feel it everywhere you step. So 5 stars for looks and comfy, 3 stars for construction/quality."
4,Love them!!!,I wear them almost every day. They are comfortable for standing and walking for long periods of time. The only part is the strap across the top of my foot sometimes slides down and I have to fix it.
3,"Comfy, cute, but wear out quickly","These are amazingly comfortable and look nice enough to wear to work (as a teacher). Downsides are that they get smelly after a few wearings - but I've thrown them in the wash and they come out fine. The biggest disappointment was that even though I've only had them 6 weeks, the soles are already losing their tread and they are becoming slippery on wet surfaces, even outside on cement."
4,Happy with purchase,"These do just what I want them to do - and they seem sturdy and comfortable. Only small issue is the ""teva"" tag in the sole of the shoe - I can feel it when I wear the sandals (though I eventually adjust). Probably with time it will press down into the shoe more.I'm not much of a ""flip flop"" kind of person, to I'm adjusting to the thing between my toes, but it's been a gentle adjustment with these sandals and they stay on my feet well."
4,great shoe for kicking around,This is a comfortable shoe for everyday wear. You can wear it in the rain when your suede sandals can't come out to play!
4,Better than expected.,"I was a bit nervous ordering these shoes because many wrote how narrow and uncomfortable they were. I have a difficult fit, yet these shoes were comfortable from the moment I put them on. The material did not cut between my toes, they were very chique looking, and almost felt like they had an arch support. I too wish they came in a solid color, but the pair I ordered, red, is lively and fun. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I have not worn them enough to know if my raves will continue after extended use. I would definitely buy more, especially at this sale price."
3,"Big fan of Teva products, but not this one.","I'm a big fan of Teva products but these flip flops were just not doing it for me. I love the strappy criss-cross and the blue color, but after a while the straps were just too much trouble to readjust every time i put the shoes on. I've had shoes like this before and the straps gave a little, but these just weren't as comfortable and I didn't where them as much as I had wanted to. :("
3,"Really cute, comfortable, but possibly defective","These are really cute sandals, with wonderfully squishy soles, and if my other pair is any indication, they'll stand a good bit of wear and tear for such a reasonably-priced shoe. Unfortunately, I'm having to return this particular pair to Amazon, because one shoe is solidly a half-size bigger/looser in the width than the other.Another small point is that I was expecting ""Stitches Black"" to be black sandals with white stitching. The stitches are actually metallic electric blue, which may not come across on all monitors (it certainly didn't on mine). I actually liked the blue better, but with the fit issues, back they go!"
3,OK But sized Small,Sized small.. Little toe on left foot hangs out No way to get full foot into it. This is my third Olowahu Flip FLop. The first was great and lasted forever. The second was like this one. Wore heal down in 3 months. Small Little Left Toe wont go into shoe or stay there if forced. Tore my little toenail back attempting to wear. I love Teva but wont buy another pair of these.
2,Unhappy,I bought these sandals because of the name and users recommendations. I found then to be uncomfortable due to the material between my toes.I offered them to my daughter and she also found the material uncomfortable.
2,"I got a badly manufactured pair, but color was what I hoped.","The pair I received were a beautiful color--just what I was looking for, but one of the sandals was not manufactured properly, one of the bands that crosses over the foot was way too long, so it didn't fit properly. I was disappointed to have to send it back, bc there were no others to get a replacement."
2,Sizing different this year,"I've been buying a new pair of Tevas every year for the past 4 years because I've loved & used them so much.I ordered a 7 again this year, but it was too small. I ordered a 7.5 and that was too big. They must have changed manufacturers, or changed something about the shoe.I've been looking in brick-and-mortar stores as well, hoping the shoes shipped from Amazon were just a bad batch. No luck yet though.I will be really disappointed if I can't find any that fit next year."
3,"comfy, but not good if you have plantar fasciitis","These sandals are extremely comfortable. The only problem I have with them is that I have heal spurs and plantar fasciitis and if I wear these for too long a period of time, my arches begin to hurt. That was a little disappointing to me, but not because of the quality of the shoes! That is the only reason these did not get 4 or 5 stars.I would recommend them to anyone who does not suffer from heal spurs or plantar fasciitis."
3,good & bad,"I absolutely love the squishy bottom texture, it makes my knees and ankles feel better than traditional flip flips. I feel like I'm walking on a cloud! However I have long & narrow feet and the straps do not hug my feet nearly as close as I'd like, I feel like I'm swimming in them. I think these would be best suited for a medium-wide width foot."
3,"Not pleased, but not disappointed.","This flip flop has a thick foam bottom, which makes it a little too ""chunky"" for my taste. Bought it so I could embellish the straps with beads, etc. Probably won't go through with that because the straps are taught when I have the flops on. Perhaps if I wear them in they'll get more comfortable."
5,Cushy summer comfort,"I love love love these comfy, durable summer sandals. They're perfect with skirts, capris and shorts. I have them in several colors and wear them daily."
3,A little too small,"Nice sandals. Seemed like they would be comfortable and fit my needs however, they ran a little small. I would have ordered the next 1/2 size up but it wasn't available."
2,ARRIVED LATE ....,"Due by 2/24/12 - 2/29/12 .... arrived 03/03/2012. LATE and extremely disappointed, will NOT purchase from supplier (HEART & SOLE SHOES) again. The correct item (color/size) was shipped correctly - so i gave it 2 stars. Amazon is usually better than this.The actual sandal was comfortable and acceptable. It deserves 5 stars. I have bought 7 pairs (from other people) and I do LOVE the flip-flops."
1,Gave me plantar fasciitis,Wore them once. Thought they felt good. They looked really nice. Woke up the next morning and couldn't walk. Have been limping ever since (3 weeks so far). Thumbs down for lousy arch support.
4,a more supportive flip-flop,"I bought a pair of these for myself and for my daughter. We both have high arches. These were perfect for the beach, around the house and everyday wear. More comfortable than my croc flip-flops. I only gave this product five stars because the foam sole will most likely last for only one spring/summer season."
5,Great Product!,I bought these sandals specifically for my trip to Mexico. I knew I was going to do a lot of walking and I wanted something comfortable. These sandals are SO COMFORTABLE!!!! We were walking for hours and my feet did not hurt once! I would recommend this to anyone!
5,Teva Flip Flop,We were very happy with the flip flops. My daughter loves them and we were happy with the servce we recieved.
3,Not in love with these,They fit but I do not like the feel of the flip flop :( Ive been wanting to try these for years and feel let down
5,I Luv These Flip Flops,"This is the 3rd pair of these flip flops I've purchased. They are very comfy and don't make my toes hurt. They do run a little small, so if you wear a 1/2 size, purchase the larger size."
3,"comfy sandals, but very little support offered","I bought these as I needed a slightly ""dressier"" sandal than my chacos. While these are comfy, they provide very little support, and the fact that they mold so easily was a downside for me. I have fallen arches, and my feet just squished the arch support in these shoes, they did nothing for supporting my foot. They're fairly comfy, but again, I don't recommend them if you're looking for a sandal with good support.Like others, I did find I needed to ""round up."" I usually wear a 9 or 9 1/2, and the 10 fits me perfectly."
5,Teva's are great!,I love my Teva's. This is my 4th pair. I hope they are always available. The price was great too.
4,"Small width, but comfy shoe","I was looking for a flip flop that would stay on my foot a little better for walking around festivals and a friend recommended these. Came very quickly in the mail but as soon as I tried them on I noticed it is very hard to get the straps in a comfortable position on my foot. Ordered size 11, what I normally wear, and I do not have wide feet. I would recommend ordering up at least a half size in these as they seemed a little tight and short in the footbed. Otherwise it is a VERY comfy sole and I hope to find these in a 12 so I can wear them!"
4,teva flip flops,"Comfortable, cute. The 'extra' straps (3rd and 4th) are a bit loose on my foot, but nonetheless I will wear these and I am glad I purchased them. Well worth the sale price!"
2,Nice product sizing varies,Have bought several pairs of this exact sandal in the past few years. The pair I received was too wide to wear-so I had to return it. Not happy. Will not buy this product online again--Not consistent sizing.
5,Worth Every Penny,"I would suggest to everyone to visit the Teva website and sign up for their emails, because often you can get a good deal on their shoes. That said, I used to buy $2.50 Old Navy flip flops, and thus thought my mother-in-law had lost her ever-loving mind when she purchased Tevas for me. Now I LOVE TEVAS!! This style in particular is wonderfully supportive and conforms to the shape of your foot. They clean easily-- they can be thrown in the washer-- look nice enough for business casual wear, and feel amazing. Regarding the size issue, I have a fairly wide foot, as does my husband, and we haven't had a problem with fit. (Common sense should dictate that if you are a half size, you need to purchase the next larger size, not smaller.) Do not hesitate to spend the money on this shoe. Your feet will thank you."
2,No longer good for narrow feet,I have very narrow feet and bought a pair of these a few years ago. They fit perfectly. Now they're old and not very supportive so I went to get another pair. The straps are so loose on the new ones that they barely stay on my feet. I was so disappointed. If you have narrow feet the 2011 version of these probably won't fit. I'm sad that shoes for wide feet have taken over the world. I am stuck with my old ones until they fall apart.
2,Returned them,"I like flip flops. These were cute and on a good sale. For me, the sensation of webbing wrapped around my big toe wasn't comfortable - or was it just too tight around the toe for my liking? Had to return them, since I knew they wouldn't get worn."
2,I really like the color,shoe is not supportive. Even if it is a Teva. I am need support for arches. It is very cute but if you need stablization even with extra strapes this is not it.
5,comfortable sandal!!,"I like every product from Teva, it is really comfortable for everyday walking. The style is very casual though...but i am student, it's fine for me to wear casual sandal to school everyday."
4,Best Flip Flops,"I adore these shoes, they are all I want to wear in the summer. I only wish you could get the straps in solid colors."
4,"Wasn't sold at first, but then..","These are definitely comfy shoes. The soles are squishy, just like the other reviews said. My only complaint is the strap by my littlest toe needed some breaking in. It took almost 2 weeks, but my foot is no longer squished. Great shoes now. I wore them all day today as I chased my preschoolers around the aquarium and my feet still feel great this evening. I absolutely recommend these shoes."
2,"Comfy, but too tight!!!","I ordered these shoes because I loved the way they looked. When I received them, I was shocked at how comfortable they were! However, the reason why I gave these shoes only two stars was because of their tightness. I wear a size 7 and I am always true to size, however, these shoes felt extremely tight, even after attempting to stretch them out. In addition to feeling quite snug, every time I walked in them, I felt as if my feet were slipping out the back little by little each step. Also, these shoes do not offer much support. If you want a shoe this in this style, I recommend checking out Rafters Antigua Sandals."
3,Too wide,I have numerous pairs of these flip flops which I have loved until this recent purchase. I was very disappointed as the straps were too wide compared with my previous purchases which resulted in foot strain.
3,Cute & Comfy but sole blackens feet,Very cute and comfortable but sweating in them seems to draw out the dye from the sole and causes my feet to blacken. Will try soaking sandals in soapy water to dilute dye.
5,The most comfortable flip flops ever!,"I purchased these flip flops for casual wear, but I find that I want to wear them all the time. They are so comfortable! I even wore them the other day when my husband and I did one of our 3-4 mile walks, and they were perfect. I bought these in all black, but now I'm ready to order some more in other colors."
4,Awesome!,Bought these for a Disney trip. I can't wear tennies and being Pooh sized (20)I looked for a shoe with some support that would absorb the impact of my weight. Large concern was the wear on my foot (rubbing etc..). Teva lived up to my expectations. I did have to switch up shoes after about 6-8 hours of walking is why I rated a 4 out of 5.
4,Very Comfy! Go one size up for proper fit. Makes Slapping Noise,"I love the way they feel on my feet. Cute straps, but the only thing I do not like is when I first tried them on to walk through the house they make a loud slapping noise more than other flip flops, which my husband heard from the other end of the house. I did not really see a review for that, so that is why I am writing that now. It is annoying sound, so keep that in mind for others. My guess is probably the Olowahu is softer material, so they will make more noise. I know it is always a gamble ordering shoes online, but reading the reviews help make my decision on the purchase. If you don't mind the noise you will love the shoe. I don't have wide feet, but according to the reviews I read they have made the shoe narrow from previous ones. I normally wear an 8 to 8.5 and ordered a 9, which fit perfect. So remember one size up for most."
3,Not for Narrow Feet,Two friends with narrow feet had purchased these sandals so I ventured forward ordering two pair on sale. Had to send them back. The straps were not nearly snug enough to keep them on my feet. Each step was an effort.
3,Sizing - runs large,"These are a neat looking sandal, but I ordered my usual size and found them to be extremely too large; I cannot comment whether they would be comfortable when worn, although I think they would make a comfy sandal. There is no support in the sole - but that is usual for most of your typical flip-flops; at least with these, if one had the right size, they could fit snugly and hug your foot - what I hoped and anticipated. I returned them and opted not to try to next smaller size, risking the need again for a return."
2,"pretty to look at, but...","Very uncomfortable to wear. I did not realize from the photos before purchased, that this was a ""thong"" - thought it was a criss/cross flip flop. Not only is it a thong, but a coarse and narrow thong material is utilized, making them quite painful and uncomfortable - cutting between the toes. Teva has a good name, but this flip flop is a disappointment - only good for bath to bedroom to dress. Too bad, as they are quite attractive"
2,I wanted to like these shoes.,"I have VERY narrow feet. I ordered these and actually had trouble wedging my foot in. Once I did, wearing them was impossible due to the straps rubbing blisters on the tops of my feet. I had to send them back."
2,not good for short pinky toes,"I had hoped these would be good for walking around campus during summer semester but the narrow cross strap keeps slipping under my short pinky toes. This makes it really uncomfortable and I have to keep stopping and repositioning the strap. Nice colors, not very cushy sole because it's so thin and overall very sorry I bought them without trying first."
5,My favorite!,"This is my favorite Teva flip flop! It stays put with no effort (I have narrow feet). It's very comfy and NEVER hurts my feet...I wear them ALL THE TIME! (all day, everday, almost everywhere)"
5,"Comfort, Versatility and Class","I keep buying these sandals in different colors. The totally black version is great for something a little more dressy. Other colors are great for more casual days. These far outstripe typical flip-flops. I love how the sole gradually molds to your foot for ultimate comfort and the straps are sturdy to keep the sandal in place, but gentle enough not to cause blisters or pain. I wear these everywhere... I have hiked many rocky trails in them and love that I can walk through streams without worry then jump back on the main trails knowing that my feet will be dry in a short time. People try to make me buy closed in shoes but they just don't offer the same comfort."
3,retromommy,this teva sandel is very pretty in the purple. One problem...the dirt & dust get embedded at the base of the straps and on the foam bed...BUT very light in weight and sporty enough to take a walk in & to wear with a skirt or dress..
4,Cute style,"I ordered these before I found my ultimate flip flop, the Sanuk Yoga Mat. I had read a lot of reviews and ordered these in my usual size, 7M. They fit fine in length but they are slightly wide on my feet -- not to the point that they're flopping around too much but the outside strap that goes from the pinkie toe to the inside of the shoe is quite loose. The other straps keep the flip flop fairly secure but I think it would be better if the pinkie strap were a little tighter. The style is very nice which is the reason I kept the black pair ( I had also ordered brown but returned them ). They look a little dressier than your typical flip flop. For comfort, my favorite flip flop is the Sanuk Yoga Mat -- super comfortable and a better fit for a foot that isn't wide."
3,sizing has changed,"I LOVE these sandals. I have one in brown, and this is my third pair in black. I am sad to only give 3 stars because the sizing has changed. After wearing a size 10, which felt like two surfboards on my feet, I went down to a size 9 in the brown which I bought last summer, and they fit perfectly! My black Tevas have been worn through so I recently bought another size 9 in black, and they are about a half size too small. It's a huge shame they have to change products when loyal customers go buy the same size and brand, and then don't get what they are expecting."
2,Darn sandals,I was sure with all the good reviews that these sandals would be awesome. Well for me...they are not. I do not like the way they feel at all. They are cushy on the bottom which is nice but they are just not comfy. The straps are not comfy. Sadly..I threw my money away on these since I had to wear them to find out I do not like them. Poor me..
3,cute sandal,"These are really cute sandals, however a little uncomfortable for me since one of the straps catches my small toe, but that's probably just me since my small toe is REALLY small. I'm hoping there will be some give to the stap at least that's what I hope because I really like them and bought two pairs."
1,Straps loose and not uniform,"This is the 2nd pair of these sandals I've ordered. I LOVED the first pair. They were so comfortable, light weight, fit secure on my feet and provided arch support. So I ordered another pair of the exact same sandal for this season. I don't know what's happened in the manufacturing process but the quality has definitely suffered. The straps were all over the place, some were way too loose, others too snug. They were not comfortable mainly due to the way the straps were sewn, so I sent them back to Amazon and requested a refund. Have not received yet. I also ordered a pair of the Mandalyn Wedge Ola flip flop at the same time. Again, I have had another pair of those, and the new ones were not as comfortable. Foot bed was harder than first pair, straps not uniform as to fit. TEVA WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR QUALITY???"
3,Not as Comfortable as they Used to Be.,"I bought these flip flops from Teva a few years back and had to buy a new pair when my new puppy got his little puppy teeth into them! On a good note, they did last for three years and would have lasted many more if it were not for the pup. However, the newer version has a LOT of arch support, much more than than my old version. As I have low arches, it means I can't wear them more long periods of time or I feel aches in my knees and low back. And I'm only 27 and quite fit! Be warned: if you have low arches, wear them all day in the house before you settle on keeping them. If you have high arches? Well, you'll probably love them. Great cushion, well made, does not cause blisters, but NOT GOOD for those with low arches."
2,returned this,"These fit a little small for the size, even from other Chacos. I ended up returning them since the straps seemed tight."
5,"Love these sandals!! Comfy, colorful and fun!",I bought a pair like these years ago and can't find them anywhere. I've looked for these sandals for years and was so surprised to find them online. They are so comfortable and go with so many of my clothes. Thanks Amazon!
5,Firebird Moms' Favorite,"I'm not a flip-flop fan, but once I tried these Teva Flip-Flops, I was a changed woman. These are the greatest. I spend many hours at the softball fields. I needed something washable, affordable, and comfortable. My friend from Boston came to visit, and I tried her Teva's on. I was on line in no time. When I went to the next softball tournament, all of the moms were trying on my flip-flops. By the next tournament, all the moms had their own pair of Teva Flip-Flops. Our daughters were saying to us, ""Hey, my mom has flip-flops like that in a different color."" They are now the official ""Quad City Firebirds 93's moms'"" flip-flops. Thanks Teva..How about a red, white, and blue pair with a QC Firebird on the side...."
5,Olowahu Teva Flip Flop,This is a very comfortable sandal and just the right height. Love this style- it's my third pair of Teva's and they're all wonderful!
4,Great!,Love them!They are so comfortable.I'm thinking of getting them in different colors too.I only wish they made more colors.
5,Very comfortable!,"I have the all black ones, they look great. They are soft but seem to be holding up to daily use. I ordered my regular size, perfect fit. Slightly stiff out of the box but loosened up."
5,Eclectic Blend,"An excellent medley of international mellow tunes that flow with perfect precision. Chill Lounge is similar to the Hotel Costes series with its ripple of French tunes and classic chill favorites. Perfect for background music, car travel, and even studying."
5,Lounge Music,Great album! Great to relax with and enjoy the music. It will bring you in a good mood. Highly recommend it!!!
2,elevator/music/chillout,This CD has that smooth jazz sound. They chose the most uninteresting tracks from good artists and built generic elevator chill out.
2,Disappointed,"After reading all the reviews and ordering the CD, I was disappointed. It was not what I expected. Out of the dozen CDs I bought this was my least favorite."
4,Good and relaxing,"This is a nice, relaxing but upbeat vibed CD. I like to put it on when having cocktails and unwinding. Good background for a party. Like you're at a high-end lounge."
5,Love it!,"If you want to find a quality music- this is it. Modern, vibrant, relaxing at the same time, classy-chic. It brings the atmosphere of romance and celebration. Great and succesful mixture of different artists. I want more!"
5,"Perfect Quiche Dish - More ""Lime Green"" than ""Avocado""","This is a perfect quiche dish in a great color. Although it is called Avocado, it really is more of a lime green. I came of age in the 60's so trust me, I know Avocado! But that being said, I love the color. I bought three in three different colors to be able to set a colorful brunch table and I am not disappointed. The colors are bright and cheerful and the glaze is shiny and smooth which makes removing the quiche a breeze. I highly recommend. Someone has tagged this ""quiche pan"", but obviously doesn't know that in cooking terms, ""pans"" are metal, ""dishes"" are glass, pottery, or ceramic, etc. So now you know!"
4,A Great Remix Compilation,"I was looking for a breakbeat compilation and found this. A few tracks have some sweet breakbeats, but there's so much more funk that can't be contained by just one musical subgenre. These new school remixes have taken these already great tracks and transformed them. There are a couple tracks on the CD that don't quite slide with me, but the majority are awesome. Whodini vs The Freestylers, A Tribe Called Quest vs Aphrodite, and A Tribe Called Quest vs Norman Cook especially are otherwordly and deserve to be cranked up on everyone's stereo system."
5,THIS CD IS DOPE!!!! BUY IT!!!!,"This is on of the best CD compilations to come out in a while. This brings back to the limelight two of my all time favorite groups, ATCQ and the Stone Roses. The first time I heard the mix of ""Can I Kick It"" it got me so movin I brought the house down, serious. BUY THIS CD!!!"
2,Dearly dissappointed...,"After hearing a few tracks from the second volume I thought the first one would be even better... Yet I was extremely dissappointed when I heard the album... If you like old 80's hip-hop with boring, weak techno beats then this is the album you have been waiting for..."
1,Talk about bias!,"This film starts out by saying that it presents its subjects ""in their own words"", then goes out of its way to show these patriots- National Socialists in 1979 California- as oddballs, betraying an obvious prejudice at every step. But the filmmaker fails at several junctures: the families portrayed are obviously very loving and close; at the protests shown, the anti-National Socialists are screaming savage animals; and despite the efforts of the filmmaker, the organizational skills and leadership abilities of Allen Vincent shine through. All in all, though, a very one-sided waste of time."
3,I bought it for Sion Barzahd's theme.,"There's only one song I really like on the disc, but that's okay since it was only like two dollars."
2,Not Very Original Sadly Enough!,"The Bouncer is a sad case when it comes to music. Mainly because almost all the songs sound the same! It's one of those few CD's where you can fall asleep on song 3 and wake up on song 15 and feel like your listening to the same song! The one saving grace for this CD is The Bouncer's Theme ""Forevermore"" sung by Japanese superstar Reiko Noda! While this is a good song, sadly the english song that was in the game failed to make it on this CD (God only knows why)! I gusse if you're a lover of Squaresoft music (Or you just like collecting game CD's) this may be for you. I just wish that all the trcks had their own unique sound to them besides re-hash."
2,"""Taming of the Shrew"" Rip-Off","This book was a blatant ""Taming of the Shrew"" rip-off. It was ok, but not great and took me a very long time to really ""get into"" it. It lacked detail and historical accuracy. The author is certainly no Jo Beverley."
4,A bit like others..,"Theo tries to save Stoneridge Manor and poor Sylvester, the hero, has to choose which of the sisters to marry in order to get the inheritance. Even at that it was a good story and great characters. I know it sounds familiar but it is a fun story and the sisters, especially Rosie are great. Try it, you may like it. I love the insert art too, as so many of her books are done by Pino Dangelico, his art work is so wonderful. He is one of my favorites next to Jon Paul."
2,Not too pleased with this memory,"I purchased two sticks of this 1 Gb ram. I put it in, but then the computer started spontaneously rebooting.I ran the Microsoft memory test and 1 stick failed the test. I sent that one back to Amazon. They were good about returning my money on that one. I tried running the other one with 1 stick of the old memory - still spontaneous re-boot. I gave up and just put the old memory back in."
5,the ulimate falco cd!,I actually found this cd for less than half the price while vacationing in germany. so finding out how much I would have to pay here in the US let me know I chose the right one. I love the album pamphlet; its covered with great pix and every song is better than the last one.
1,Can't rate something I have not got!,Seriously? You want me to review a CD that I have not been able to listened to yet because I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT!!!!That is sort of rude don't you think? Let's see I purchased it on 2/10/11 and this is 3/15/11. What's up with that?
2,Disappointing,"I'm 46 and have my share of golf related pain and minor injuries. I can say that this book has done nothing for me. I've had some minor lower back pain and the advise the book gave was rest, and stretch more. Good advise, but I had already figured that out after googling ""lower back pain golf"". I have also had some minor persistent pain in my left thumb and hip. I found nothing in the book to explain these pains.This may help those who have no clue about the basics injury prevention. I found the book full of basics that I learned while playing high school sports and I found nothing in the book can't be learned on the internet."
4,"Some great songs, some less so","I'd suggest starting with The Ark's previous two albums, 'We Are The Ark' and 'State of The Ark'. This is another collection of campy retro glam rock, which these Swedes are masters of. But whereas their previous albums were jam-packed with solid material (aside from a couple slow numbers that I tend to skip), this has some great material ('No Decorum', 'Death to the Martyrs') and some filler ('Thorazine Corazon' might be the most blatant example). The Ark specialized in a very particular type of music, and I think this is where their concept started to run aground."
2,Experimental music,"I would call this type of music 'experimental'. There's some complexity to the music, but not enough to control the listener's interest in any aggressive way. Don't get me wrong, I like this stage in Miles' career, but I would suggest that you buy his ""Live at the Fillmore"" sets over this package."
1,Amazon shills again!,"Do not order this from Amazon Direct unless you want to pay $45 for a regular plastic jewel case. The product detail says ""Miniature LP 2007"" but all I got was the 2000 edition housed in a plastic jewel case! Normally I would suck it up, but considering how much I've spent here at Scamazon I thought they could have extended themselves a little beyond the standard boiler plate response and apology.LAMEP.s. I LOVE MILES!"
2,"The african wild dog:Behavior, Ecology and conservation","I ordered this book for my husband as a gift, because we plan to go to Africa and he loves the wild dogs.The book is too technicle and is more appropriate for research. I would not recommended this book for pleasure reading."
2,Odd One Indeed...,"Although I LOVE Takeshi Kaneshiro in this, the movie itself wouldn't be worth watching without him in it. And if I hadn't read the plot summary prior to watching the film (that informed me of certain points), I wouldn't have known what was meant to be going on most of the time. I did laugh a couple of times during the movie. That elevator scene was very comical. Overall, it's not a movie I regret watching, but it's also not a movie I feel the need to watch again."
3,Wanted: script editor,"The Odd One Dies is another film from Hong Kong's ""doom generation"" of film making, the 5-7 uneasy years leading up to the hand over of power to communist Chinese control. It is a fresh and occasionally funny film about small-time criminals that oozes with hopelessness, a sentiment representative of many citizens who could not leave Hong Kong. However, what keeps The Odd One Dies from being a completely depressing film like Wong Kar Wai's brooding crime dramas As Tears Go By or Days of Being Wild is Takeshi Kaneshiro, who despite the somber material, has an amazing comic presence (and the film's running joke involving severed fingers doesn't hurt either). The one major fault with The Odd One Dies is the story, which has some neat ideas but tends to meander and lose focus on many occasions."
5,Sicilian Dragon Yugoslav 9 Bc4,Very good work of theory its best for the hard study chess player you will learn a lot from this a nice old man gave me this book sence i played chess with him and it done me wonders.
5,A great expose,"In a topic that could quickly and easily become extremely boring this book is written with style and humor. It's hard to make taxes, abatements, and TIFs fascinating (see your eyes are already glazing over at the mere mention aren't they?), but Greg LeRoy does. He gives information on who does it (nearly all corporations with a noticeable exception of Toyota which he points out), how they do it (short answer: consultants, meaningless studies, and no accountability) and the consequences of these actions(school underfunding, road underfunding, etc). A phenomenal book that makes me greet each ""success"" in luring a new business to the area with increased skepticism."
4,Good advice,"I found this book on my first read to be informative, well sourced, and well thought out. Marilyn offers many tips on diet and supplements, many of which I'm trying to implement but I'm having a little trouble with the dietary because I'm a vegetarian who doesn't eat too many eggs or dairy, and she recommends 3 servings a day of dairy but then goes on to let you know that there can be some problems associated with dairy for infertile women, and that if you have PMS you can help the symptoms sometimes by avoiding dairy. Anyway, I thought the rest of the advice seems sound and is worth trying! It's a well-written book and I'm going to recommend it."
4,Great book with a grain of salt.,"This book provides some very very useful information.I found the tone to be a real turnoff though...seemed overly newagey and preachy.I preferred to use it as a reference and basically skim it for the info I needed. I read certain sections that applied to what I was observing in my cycle more closely. I also applied a lot of my own common sense to her recommendations. I erred on the side of taking the supplements she recommends in the lower dosages since I have a very small frame.I would recommend this sort of book and any other book that approaches fertility naturally to be read with ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"". I believe that you really need to chart your cycle to see exactly where things are going amiss."
2,not much info,I didn't find this book very helpful in listing what foods to eat or not. It was just general information. No real gems of knowledge. Basically eating a lowfat diet is recommended. Seems out-of-date.
4,"highly practical, excellent book","As a Family Physician, this book gave me some practical advice and solutions to many of the ""untreatable"" problems that many women suffer today. The diet and supplement program, particulary the ""Optivite"" supplement by Optimox Corp. has in many cases dramatically improved or cured patients and friends of frequent headaches, chronic low energy, infertility, dysmennorrhea, and severe PMS. One patient, a middle aged woman, still complained of severe fatigue and low energy in spite of adequete thyroid and hormonal replacements. With one week of diet and Optivite, as per this book, she was waking up early, and even had done her spring cleaning. This is only one of the many remarkable and unbelievable results I have witnessed. Spread the good news, this is an important read for all women."
5,Hopeful and Helpful,"Let me start by saying that I am 39 years old and expect to deliver my first child a few days before my 40th birthday!I give this partly to Marilyn Shannon. I was unwilling to do synthetic fertility treatment, and a bit discouraged (sometimes very discouraged) because of my age at the chances of getting pregnant. Some friends and most Medical professionals were very discouraging.Ms. Shannon's book was recommeded in 'Taking Charge of your fertility' , also a fantastic book. I learned things every woman past puberty ought to know about what the heck is going on in there.My cycle changed dramatically when I started to take Ms. Shannon's advice. I am also hypo thyroid which makes it less likely to conceive.So, I didn't meet my fella until a few years ago, and we were married only 6 months before we got pregnant.Don't give up hope!"
2,Read with Caution,"This book does contain useful information about general nutrition, especially when it comes to encouraging whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Beware, though, because the author advocates megadoses of vitamins that in many cases are not considered safe by the medical community. While she does reference studies in some cases, she also bases a lot of claims on anecdotal experience, and any scientist knows this isn't science at all."
4,"Good information, very biased","This book has the single best source of concrete medical information about menstrual disorders that I have found. Unfortunately, the author has a strong anti-choice bias, and an actually nasty attitude towards relaxation techniques, of all things. (Apparently, Christians don't need to relax). She also blithely recommends buying vitamins from an anti-choice provider. So, be warned. On the plus side, the instructions on getting a sample of sperm in a 'moral' way provide some comic relief.I can also heartily recommend 'Take Charge of Your Fertility.' These two books were very instrumental to me rectifying my menstrual disorders, using only vitamins and herbal supplements, and those in small quantities."
1,From a LEGIT nutrition professional,"Don't waste your money on this book. Most of the info in the book comes from what a few (literally 3) male physicians think about nutrition and pms, and Ms. Shannon simply rewites their thoughts. She practically sells supplements in the book, most are mega doses of micronutrients which any legitimate nutrition professional will tell you to be cautious of. Mainly she never even mentions credible nutrition research organizations when telling people where to turn for info, Instead she recommends supplement sales people for advice. HELLO-taking your money and BIASED! This book does give validity to the connection between mood and nutrition-HOWEVER Credible nutrition professionals have letters behind their name and sign a code of ethics-high standards to which they will be held to- this Ms. Shannon has not agreed to not advertise erroneous information. It's not worth the ink and paper used to print it."
1,Scientific and ojective? ---NOT!,"Some of the information was basic common sense, and some of it may actually be helpful. However, I have to doubt the validity of the author's recommendations based on two factors: 1.) Her ""evidence"" is often anecdotal and has no scientific support, and 2.) Most importantly, her militant views on religion would obviously not allow for other possibilities to be considered. The religious bias in Shannon's writing leads me to believe that she would sacrifice objectivity in the face of furthering her cause. I also took offense to having her brand of Christianity shoved down my throat and I hope non-Christians don't think we're all like this zealot. In retrospect, I see that the publisher is an affiliated religious organization, but the company seems eager to deceive the purchaser by not stating that affiliation or bias anywhere on the covers. I wish I had my money back because who knows what radical causes it has now gone to support."
1,Great Dancing but the sound is Out of Synch!,"Don't waste your money. Unfortunately, this long awaited DVD was transferred badly and the sound in part one is out of synch by several counts. Suzanne Farrell and Merrill Ashley are dancing off the music and it is very annoying. It is unbelievable that something like this could happen when you take into consideration that Balanchine was probably the most musical choreographer that ever lived. Never pedantic, always magical. I did inform the Balanchine Trust. They were surprised and are looking into it. They are aware that the transfer was done incorrectly. The company that produced the DVD, Nonesuch was also called but did not respond. Wait until it?s fixed unless you like dancing 4 counts behind the music."
3,Not on music!,"I was extremely shocked to see that the dancing was not synchronised with the music. The dancers are wonderful, as is the choreagraphy of George Balanchine, and it's most unfortunate that the DvD is obviously flawed."
3,Not NYCB; there is no choreography in ballet,"First I want to say that ballet is art, and subsequently, it is dangerous.This DVD is a mash. It is not New York City Ballet. You are seeing Suzanne Farrell in .3. The ""corps de ballet"" is a professional army invading the sea. You see Heather Watts, in theme 3.There is no choreography in ballet. They just dance in a starsea. You are looking at space bleeds and catapulting. There are no theatre entrances, only air grates and valences. There are no curtains. There is no audience. They dance in four walls in space. There is no rapport with an audience.In ""Tzigane,"" Suzanne is looking at the air. What is behind her is what is in front of her. There are no cameras. The Holy Father crafts the day by way of a bee. It is a star pass.They are NOT all New York City Ballet. This DVD was done deliberately. You are looking at drag queens in the other ""scenes."" These DVDs are attacks on the United States and the British Royal family.Here's the proof: [...]"
4,Hawaii Atlas,The subject matter is broad and the graphics are well placed.However the demographic and statistical data is dated (ten years old) and not reflecting the more recent changes in population and density.
2,Old edition,thought it was an updated version based on the 2010 census and it is actually the previous addition so not up to date
2,Not a good map source,It you are looking for topographic maps or nautical charts or any other useful type of map do not buy this book. It is mainly geographical and social information with maybe a few general maps but nothing of detail. I was disaapointed in the atlas expecting a comprehensive collection of detailed maps of the islands.
3,Not what you think!,"This misnamed 2-tape VHS set contains the 1st Doctor episode ""The Daleks"", in which we first meet the saltshaker-clad mutants on the planet Skaro. It does not contain either of ""The Chase"" (a later 1st Doctor episode also featuring the Daleks) or ""Rememberance of the Daleks"" (a 7th Doctor episode)."
2,Like reading a book written by Yoda,"The authors of this book have a great deal of technical knowledge. Unfortunately, their technical talent is stunted by their inability to use simple language, or hire an editor who can translate for them. When not reading like a dictionary, the book reads like a volume written by Yoda. They make simple concepts extremely complicated by their inability to use anything but the most complicated manner of explanation.I am not actually taking this test, so I cannot rate it as a study guide."
3,"Not bad, but lacking","The book seems a bit basic in that it tries to cover only topics you will see on the exam. Despite that fact, I found that a fair number of questions on the exam were not covered in the book... at least not well enough. If you want to actually get some hands on practice, this is not the book for it. With the exception of a few commands, the book has nothing for you to try out.The practice tests on the CD are decent. Don't expect to see all the Network+ questions on the CD. Some explanations for wrong answers are helpful, others are trivial/useless.If you plan to take the Network+ exam this book should work for you if you already have a fair amount of networking knowledge and/or you use it in addition to another book to supplement what's not covered."
3,Barely passed exam,"I just took the Network+ exam today and barely passed. The book has lots of good information, however it does not tell you everything you need to know for the 2007 exam! This book was written for the 2005 exam. Maybe if I took the 2005 exam I would have done much better, but I studied this front to back thoroughly and barely passed. There were many questions I had no clue on, because the book never spoke about it.If you get this book, consider it a foundation, and then get something else that focuses on the 2007 exam. The book has very good information, just keep in mind that you will need to continue further than it gives you."
3,Author needs editor,"This book may be substantive and very relevant to a certification but it is not well written. Author makes assumptions that the reader is knowledgeable of a subject in one part of the book than explains those concepts in detail later. I found double negatives, senseless sentence structures, and misspelled words throughout the book.Function A+Form C-"
4,Great book for the exam,"I really enjoyed using this book to prepare for the Network+ exam. I used another book from McGraw-Hill/Osborne and it just didn't help me as much. What I liked the most was the fact that the author did more than prepare me for the exam, he helped me prepare for actually supporting networks. Great book!"
5,Quantum Quest,"Power Rangers Time Force is AWSOME! My guess is that this movie will have Worlds Apart on it (possibly), The Quantum Quest, and Clash for Controlle parts 1, and 2. However, Fox ... ... currently not aired all of the episodes featuring the Quantum Ranger, so there will probably be more!"
3,Feel the power of Time Force!,"Power Rangers Time Force is probably the best of the Power Rangers series. Although this isn't the best Time Force video, it does leave you wanting more, and is vital to truly enjoying the finale episode. Good stuff!"
1,NOT the ORIGINAL CRAWLSPACE from L.A.,"This is NOT the ORIGINAL CRAWLSPACE from L.A. Releases by the original Crawlspace are available on Majora Records, The Lotus Sound, and Sympathy for the Record Industry."
2,Quality piece but didn't fit !,"This is a quality pad as all the Pachmayr products are. It was purchased for anewer Marlin 1895 .45-70 22"" lever gun. It was advertised to fit this gun howeverit wasn't close at all, to small as I recall. If it were oversized, I may have done whatother have and trimmed it down by grinding it and shaping it.Now that I shot the gun more, I may stay with the factory pad as it doesn't kick thatbad for a 100 yard shot. I got a Pachmayr triple for my .300 Win Mag. and that'sa winner !!William"
3,What you pay for is what you get.,"I purchased this book for $6.95 and when I received it the binding was not intact. The book was supposed to be in new condition, but it was obviously not new. For the price, I'm not suprised. I glued the binding back together and it's been working well enough."
1,Loved it until it broke,"This was a nice piece of equipment, until the handle broke after only four months. The design is cheap. Once it is broken, you just throw it away because it can't be fixed. I would recommend something else that is a little better designed and won't break after a few months of normal use."
2,"Good concept, but not very durable","This is a very convenient 2-1 grinder/shaker. However, the part that you press to grind the pepper broke after about a year (I used this product very sparingly so it wasn't from excessive wear and tear)."
3,focused more on pepper,The combination is a great idea. Being able to choose the coarseness of the grind for pepper is unique for this price range. But the salt tends to be effected by humidity quickly and binds up. As a pepper mill it is a good buy but the salt is decoration after a very short time.
4,Happy with shaker,"We have been looking for a practical combination salt and pepper shaker. When this product first arrived, I was a bit worried because the actual shaker looked and felt flimsy. But, so far so good-it's easy to use and re-fill. It's also super-easy to grind the pepper in one fell swoop, which is nice. We are really happy with the shaker. If I needed another one, I would definately but this again."
4,Cheap but pretty good,"Got these for my old yellow schwinn. They look great. Yes, they get dirty easily, but that's the breaks. They are easy to clean even thought they never get back to pristine white. it is a little tricky making them stay on. I've had to keep gluing them back on repeatly and use hairspray and tape to make them stay. Especially in the summer and wet weather. Someone stole mine and I'm buying another pair now."
4,Worth the Wait,"After a three month wait while Amazon located a copy of this I am more than satisfied. While not in the same ballpark as Elvis, Burnette etc. It is a good collection of various less common titles. Outstanding tracks include Skeets McDonalds' Heartbreakin Mamma, Jerry Reed's Mister Whizz and the Farmer Boy's My Baby Done left me. Some titles may stretch the definition of Rockabilly with too much Jordanaire type background vocals there is enough guitar licks here to make up for it."
3,Good skills developer,"Builds Kindergarten Curricular Skills by helping Reader Rabbit collect supplies to prepare for the big campfire party! Sounds great, except that the party doesn't happen. After doing all the necessary tasks the campfire party crashes the software and we can't get back to the campfire. The benefits of the skills development are very good."
4,Great but out of sync,LM.C are great and really fun to bounce around to. The only problem I have with the DVD is that most of the songs are out of sync. Some by just a fraction of a second and some by a lot more. That's something that just annoys the crap out of me. But because I love their colorful videos and catchy songs (and they're so darn cute) I can look past the flaw and give this DVD a 4/5.
2,not up to date,"The author knows much about the church, it's organs and funktions. Unfortunately there is much he ignores also. The style of his books is very critical, which, done by system is not very attractive and makes his book too long."
4,A very good read,Spanning from WWII to the 1980's is a very difficult task. To do this in 180 pages is near impossible. Mulisch does this successfully with The Assault. This story follows Anton as his family is murdered for simply having a member of the Nazi party dead in front of their house. Anton suppresses the memories of the events and restarts his live with his aunt and uncle. Through out his life though people continue to show up and jar his memory and desire to understand what happened.Mulisch could have made this story longer and no one would have complained. He is poetic in his language and lets his readers find the details instead of revealing them. The 5th star is absent because I felt the book had some political preachiness and it seemed unrealistic for the Anton character to move on the way he does.All in all it was a very good and quick read. Suggested for all ages.
5,The best Dutch book on WW2,This must be the best book written about the German occupens of the Netherlands in WW2. It's a true story of a family in the war. Read it and weap.
5,Don't watch the movie the book is even better!,"Although the movie won an Oscar and was directed by Fons Rademakers, the book is even better, if you want the most supreme Dutch novels about WW2 also read WF Hermans' The dark chamber of Damocles (litteraly translated title) with that you have the best. (of world litterature)"
4,The assault on a German officer makes hell brake loose...,This book should be read by everyone who is interested in the Second World War and the consequenses of this terrifying event. The main question is how to live with the memory of the horror of war; how to cope with people who were 'wrong' those days. Read this book and think about it. It's a must.
4,Well Written,"This is a very well written book. The first thing that you should know about this book is that it is not like any other World War II novel that is about the Nazi's. Let's just say that it takes a different viewpoint all together. This novel kept me interested and has a lot of imagery as well as foreshadowing. It is kind of written like a mystery novel in the way that you have to think in order to understand what happened and you must tie everything together in order for the story to make sense. Overall 4 out of 5 stars because it was well written but at the same time it didn't keep me at the edge of my seat, like a typical school required reading."
4,A work of art,"This is a classic book which should be read by anyone interested in WWII, or for that matter, human nature. This is the story of a man who slowly learns the truth about the events which led to the death of his family. What we perceive to be true may not be; those who seem to be our friends may not be. This is a work of art"
1,Who ever published this should be banned from publishing!,This is supposed to be a book that will help students do well on the ACT. I thought that it would be a good chance to review key concepts and then apply those concepts on practice questions. The review was there but there are so many mistakes on the practice questions you can't trust their answers or explanations. Here is an example on page 324: -5 + 9(3) = 17. Give me a break it is 22!! The mistakes are so numerous that I would recommend that everyone spend a few dollars more and get a good ACT study book. This one isn't worth the paper it is printed on!
1,It'll Make You Dummer,"This is the most useless prep book I have ever come across. There is way too much fluff in trying to get across their tips, which is ironic since conciseness and being quick is the key to doing well on the ACT. On the actual test I score 32 and 33 in the English/Reading, but in taking the practice tests from this book I scored 26/27. It's absurd. Their explanations for the correct answers were not thorough or well explained and definetly not the best choice possible. Don't even get me started on the math and science sections. Use Kaplan's Procrastinator Guide or Dummies Guide instead."
1,warning to librarians,"If you are buying this for a library, please know that the CD-ROM cannot be used repeatedly by patrons, but has a limit of only one or a few uses. Not very library friendly."
5,chamois,I have always used these on my face!!! They are soft and are really durable!! Every woman should have one!! Last better if it is colored
3,Works Just as Advertised,"The thing about this bowl is that it looks like it came from the 80's. I guess it is that bit of nostalgia that makes the soup taste the way that it does.Delivery: Bowl arrived intact and without cracks.Function: Placed hot French Onion soup in bowl. Topped with bread and Emmental cheese and placed under the Broiler. No cracks able to withstand temperatures up to 500 degrees.Cleaning: Would not recommend a dishwasher. Best to hand clean, especially if cleaning off baked on cheese.The bowls fill a niche and are really only used for special occasions. But they fulfill the need adequately for which they are used. Yes, I could order Le Creuset cookware and pay more of a premium, but for immediate needs the Fox Run product fits the bill."
3,"Small Portion, Lonely Soup Making","I am writing this review as a courtesy to other Amazon Customers. This is a Single Bowl and is NOT a ""set of two"" (as claimed in another customer review).I am not an expert on bakeware, but the bowl itself seems like it is of good quality.However, 10oz is very small for a soup bowl and I would strongly suggest getting a 16 Oz bowl for much greater versatility.And buying a set would be a much better value."
4,How does your Boss measure up? Are you a Best Boss?,This read offers some interesting tales of best and worst bosses. You can compare your boss with them and get some tips on how to cope with the boss who micro-manages or gain tips in how you can be a better boss. Enjoyable read! The anecdotes were great for illustrating the traits we love to hate and the traits we admire in our bosses and in ourselves!
5,Excellent purchase,"I have a polar FT60 HRM and I use constantly in my physical activities. So after four years the original strap was flaccida and needed a new one. I made a purchase at Polar store via Amazon and got a great product, even better than I've ever used. I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Big guy means big strap,"Much more comfortable for someone who wears 3x shirts or larger - had to ratchet it down quite a bit, suspect it would be good up to 4-5-6x"
5,Euro sizing?,"Just like some other reviews and the other one on here at the time I've written this... I wear an XL t-shirt and find the M-XXL strap that came with the polar HRM to not be large enough. While I can stand to lose a couple lbs (10-15) like everyone else, the strap fits way too tightly around the ribcage. I just checked, I'm pretty much skin-and-bone around this area... can't be due to body fat. The XXXL strap fits WAY better and allows me to get the fit just-right. Just a hint for anyone shopping around for one of these. Kind of disapointing that you have to shell out the additional $$$'s just to make the strap fit right on an honestly average-sized guy's chest.Like the other guy said, don't let the sizing be a blow to your progress or ego, I think they must have meant womens XXXL or something like that!"
4,Works quite well.,It's a little big but the size down was too small. Shih-tzu's seem to be hard to fit.
4,We Love This Little Rain Jacket!,"This little rain jacket is fantastic. I followed the sizing and got the medium for my 13 pound miniature pinscher. It is the perfect size for him length and height. The only thing that does need to be fixed is the strap that goes around the belly, it doesn't adjust enough for him. The quality of the material is great and seems really durable. The little elastic straps that go around the back legs could use a bit of improvement as they aren't very high quality - minor detail though. Overall I love it, and so does my pup - he looks so cute in it, especially with the little hood up - it actually stays on and kept him really dry in our hour long walk in the rain."
3,"Duke says ""I'm not goin' anywhere in this thing!""","My Yorkie, Duke, usually doesn't complain about sweaters, jackets, etc, as long as it means he is going for a walk, but when I put this raincoat on him, he sat down and refused to move! I thought it was cute, but he would have nothing to do with it. The coat is well made, nicely designed, quality fabric, everything I would look for in a raincoat, but for some reason, Duke thinks otherwise. For a dog, he has very strong opinions!"
4,Perfect little raincoat,"Looks adorable. Hood does not stay in place, but the rest of the coat does. Keeps pup dry."
4,great set-but not as advertised....,"i was excited to receive this, having only just recently come across the man's amazing music. as a big fan of Townes Van Zandt, Gram Parsons, and the country rock of the late 1960's i am kind of baffled as to why Gene Clark's music is not better known.that said, although i am very pleased with this 2 cd overview, i was a bit disappointed that it arrived lacking cover art. the image you see on Amazon is not what it ships with. it arrived with a cheap 4 sided black and white insert, instead of the sepia oval portrait shot you see here. it was also completely lacking in liner notes--there was no information whatsoever about the tracks.musicwise tho-top notch!"
5,Romantic,"Narciso Yepes made a beautiful sounding LP in the 1950's of these first two works with conductors Ataulfo Argenta and Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos. This CD is perhaps a little less magical, but it is still very engaging. Yepes is miked very closely, although the orchestral sound is full and enjoyable. I am perhaps a bit biased on the subject, because Yepes is the first guitarist whose records I bought (Vivaldi concerti with Paul Kuentz, now on CD). His playing sounds wonderfully idiomatic to me, with an added reflective feeling in the Fantasy. I have recordings of the Concierto de Aranjuez by Parkening, Garcia, and Williams, all of them very good. I just feel that this one has a degree of authenticity, both from the soloist and the orchestra, that the others lack. The Concierto Andaluz features The Romeros recorded in a more natural perspective, with beautiful sounds coming from the Academy of St.-Martin-in-the-Fields. This is a simply lovely album."
3,Far from the best,"Buying this album is not in your best interest. This is probably the worst recording of Aranjuez I've heard and I've heard many different versions. Narcisco Yepes's interpretation is amature. He especially butchers the cadenza in the second movement of Aranjuez. His performance of Fantasia para un Gentilhombre is uninspired. His technique is lame and the entire recording is just going through the motions. The only gem on this CD is Los Romeros' performance of Concierto Andaluz. It is very well done and the St. Martin in the Fields orchestra is much better than the Orquestra Simphonique that Yepes is playing with. I give this album three stars because it is simply not special at all. Buy a recording of Aranjuez by Isbin, P. Romero, Williams or Tennant. They are much better players and musicians. If you want Andaluz you can get another recording of the Romero's without having to hear Yepes' half-hearted interpretation."
3,A Dog and Monopoly Lover's Game,"This game is not for the impatient type, like every Monopoly. If you like monopoly, and if you like dogs, buy this game. You will like playing this, trust me. But if you (like me) are impatient, easily-bored, and not that into board games, don't waste your money."
3,Gave it as a gift,I gave this game as a gift to my 7 year old neighbor who is crazy about dogs but a little too old for stuffed animals. He seemed happy when he opened it but I have not asked him if he has played it yet.
4,great for all kinds of music,"been playing for close to 6 years and i bought this 5 years ago and i still play it to this day it is great for metal,rock,blues and anything in between, its dirt cheap but plays like a dream only thing i do not enjoy is the tremolo could use a little work"
4,Part of my capstone,"I originally purchased this kit as part of my capstone project for my associates degree in computer and electrical engineering. The manual that comes with the kit makes for a very good learning lab, especially if you have an RF generator and an O-scope to use. Make sure you follow the directions to a T and never assume. Once assembled the AM Part of the radio worked really well. The FM side worked OK. I had problems picking up stations inside of my school building on the FM side more than the AM side. The kit does react to noise, as it does not have a box to block it. The silk screen board is really nice as it labels the sections of the radio, but mine came with small cracks on the surface.This project is good for someone just starting out learning electronics communications."
3,"Pretty happy overall, but could be better","I bought this kit for my 12-year-old son to get the electronics bug to bite him like it bit me at that age. Overall we enjoyed building it together and he's happy with the result.Pros: nice silk-screen schematics on the board; a few steps where the assembler learns to use test equipment if it is available (but this isn't strictly needed to assemble the kit); nice large PCB gives rookie solderers space to work; parts were supplied on nicely-labeled cards; solder was includedCons: outdated PC board with only one side tinned, no through-hole tinning makes soldering harder than it would be on a modern board; some components didn't fit quite right, for example the screws to mount the tuner variable capacitor didn't fit so I had to tap bigger holes in it. The board feels like a low-end PCB from the 1980s instead of what even a low-end modern board would look likeOverall it was a good purchase but I expected something a little more up-to-date and high quality."
4,"Does not come with a solder, but still a great kit & a fun project!","I purchased the radio kit for my almost 15 year old nephew who spent few hours building it. There are small parts, but everything was in there and easy for him to follow the instructions to assemble it. Unfortunately, it did not come with a solder, so we had to get it from a hardware store."
1,not as advertised BEWARE!,"This item is not as advertised BEWARE! What I recieved was a solderless kit no speaker, a earbud. It is not even from Elenco, it is from Maxitronics, something that you would find at toys R us!"
1,This is crap,this is the crappiest toy ever. when i bought it half the pieces were missing an when we called them to replace them they gave me a peice that wasnt even part of the radio. save your money to buy a real radio!
2,This DVD is for newbees,"It's not that detailed. Read the books. The maps are nice but would have been better if they had also drawn paths traveled. Better to get the Middle Earth Atlas book. The ""soundtrack"" after about 15 minutes was reduced to the same short musical phrase over and over and over...I wanted to tear my hair out. Only redeemed by the thoughtful insite of a few commentators. If you have not read the books it will entice you to read them (if the theatrical movies haven't). Peter Jackson is not on this DVD as an other reviewer implied. It does have bits of JRR himself. The Biography was good but also is on other DVDs. The Brothers Hildebrandt discuss their paintings but it would have been better if lead by an interviewer..they do babble on a bit. Quality of the DVD does not do the artwork justice (you need to see them in print). A bit of a teaser to get the viewer to learn and see more."
3,I Like this book.,There are many things that I don't like about this book but there are many things that I also like about this book. One thing that I don't like about this book is the foul language. One thing that I do like about this book is that it shows that being in gangs is not pleasant.
2,Danny Santiago is a pseudonym,"Danny Santiago is a pseudonym for Daniel Lewis James. If you google him, you'll realize he wasn't a Chicano but posed as one using this Santiago fictional name. Then the New York Times Review of Books outed him soon after the book's publication in 1984. Does it mean you shouldn't read the book? No. But it might make a difference to you if you know who really wrote it. James died in 1988 at the age of 77."
5,All hail the adorable guinea pig!,"Kate Duke's charming book ""Guinea Pigs Near and Far"" puts welcome emphasis on the adorability of guinea pigs! So often in children's books we see mice, hamsters, squirrels, bunnies and all other manner of sweet little fuzzy animals, but the guinea pig has been sorely and notably neglected.Duke rights that wrong with ""Guinea Pigs Near and Far."" Simplistic in the extreme--just simple comparisons of words like ""near"" and ""far"" and so on--the text isn't the main attraction here. The drawing power of this book is the guinea pigs, of course. They are shown hiking, biking, riding trains, flying kites, sailing boats, and generally being completely and utterly entrancing."
2,Ghost Stories,"Bought this item for Haloween, but the kids found it a little boring.The Story teller did not grasp the kids attention.Would I buy it again , I have to say no."
2,Avoid - there are a lot of better options out there,"Because these earmuffs curl up each time you put them down, you must uncurl them EVERY TIME you want to use them, which is a hassle if you are in hurry or your hands are oily. I own three sets of these (the store only had this style at the time) and 5 sets of other styles. I much prefer the other styles due to the ease of use. Comfort, for me, is about the same no matter which earmuffs I use. While I like to avoid using these muffs due to the reason stated, I gave them two stars because they are comfortable after you go to the trouble of putting them on."
3,noise rating should be higher,"I used these when crossing on a freight ship from Europe to New York City, as my cabin was located next to the very loud engine room. I slept with them on and they were bent when I woke up each time. They don't block out that much noise, rating should be higher but it's better than nothing. Also noted: I felt doubly nauseous as I became sea sick and dizzy from hearing sensory depravation. I would recommend not shaving one's head if you wear them for prolonged periods as I developed a rash."
3,This is the wrong description!,"This is either the wrong description for this item, or it has the wrong title information."
2,Rating,"Commercial surge protectors provide KVA ratings. what is the rating on this device? What adavantage is there in having a higher ating? Upon a failure, how does one prove that the rating had not been surpassed?"
1,The mystery remains,"The author provides a explanation for what are now white anglo-saxon Jews, but what about the Jews who were dispersed throughout africa and Ethiopia, they are never mentioned. After reading this book I had more questions than answers."
3,Should have been better...,"I love Muddy Waters and was stoked about this DVD. Unfortunately it couldn't keep me awake. I was expecting much more in the way of concert footage. What was there was usually chopped up with random interviews. The smokin' version of ""Got my Mojo..."" only teased. Very few actual interviews of Muddy. I'm not sure it was even a good general documentary on the blues. The best parts were listening to Keith Richards mumble incoherently...this at least provided some comic relief."
1,"cheap, cheap, cheap","I guess you get what you pay for. The cover is very thin cardboard and was all tore up when it arrived. Cheaper to keep than to send back. S&H; was more than the product cost. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!Docket Padfolio with Pocket Cover, 5x8, White, Jr. Legal Rule, 100 Sheets/Pad (TOP63345) Category: Ruled Glue-Top Writing Pads"
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"I recently discovered T.W. Wright while browsing for books at a used book store. I came across Nursery Tale and read it within a couple of days. He is an amazing writing that mixes fantasy and horror very well.The Place is a very engaging novel. As with Nursery Tales, Wright does not just tell the story from one point-of-view, but several intertwining ones. You get to read about what each character is thinking and why they are doing what they are doing. The plot, yes there is one, has to do with how two highly intelligent individuals (the little girl and the crazed murderer) handle their unique `gifts'.The story starts with a man and his wife and son driving on an unkempt side road. They get stuck and encounter a man with a gun. The wife and son disappear and the rest of the story is about finding them. I can understand why certain aspects of this story may seem a bit out there. However, this is easily forgiven because the story is so well written.Overall, highly recommended."
1,24 month old opened in less than 12 hours.,"Maybe we should have put them on the doors before he figured out how to turn the knob.But, we waited. The first time he went for the pantry I heard him saying ""no, no no"" as he was denied checking out the snacks.By the end of the day, he found he could put pressure on it in a certain way and it opened easily for him."
2,Too complex and didn't fit our door knobs,We ordered a number of different door knobs locks and these were the ones that just didn't find a home in our home. They have rubber on the inside which actually seemed to help the kids open the doors and they were easy to pop open. They are slowly migrating to the trash can.
1,Totally useless for us,"This knob lock was totally useless for us. Too tight for our knobs, which are standard knobs from the 80's. It was actually easier to open the door with this installed as it produced a larger grip on the knob. Newer knobs may be smaller and it may work for those, I don't know."
2,Good thought,"I think that the design makes sense, but the execution just is not there. I have an old Victorian house that is updated but has many of the old door handles, like the round antique ones. On those, this product makes it easier for my daughter to open the door. She is 14 months and could not even open the door at all on her own until I put this door lock on. The second door, is an updated knob, and it did not work at all . It spun, but when you, as the adult tried to push in the bottom part to open the door, it wouldn't catch, so you literally could not open the door, baby or parent. Returning them ASAP. The good thing is the returns are really easy, even going to pay for my return shipping, so A+ to the seller!"
1,Not child proof.,"Installed this on Saturday, my 2 year old was out the door on Sunday. Does not work, it's purpose was completely defeated within minutes."
1,Figured it out in 2 days!,"Installed these on a Friday night and my not quite 2 year old had 'em figured out by Sunday afternoon!! A week later they don't even slow him down anymore :( Not sure if its the design or what but if you have a kid who's motivated and persistent... save your money! Gave it one star simply because they were easy to install and fairly inexpensive. However, if I had bought these at an actual store I probably would have returned them."
5,IT WORKS,"Was sceptical so I ordered 1 pkg. now I'm ordering 2 more,finally found a child proof doorknob cover that works!!!! Bought for my 2 yr. old even my 8yr.old has difficulty opening doors."
2,Doesn't work on small smooth knobs,"Our grandson is too young to open doors, but I found that I couldn't open the door if the knob was smooth and 2"" in diameter. On a larger door knob with bumpy perimeter, it seems to work well."
2,"No space,Rubs doorframe","Very disappointed with this product. I am unable to use it because there is not much space to push the buttons in on the sides and turn to open the door. when I turn the handle, the bottom of the lock rubs the door frame & makes it near impossible to turn to open the door."
1,Two Toddler Mummy,"We just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by Safety 1st and Parents. This cover lasted about one minute. Seriously! By the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors, my son had opened the first one my husband had installed. The tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open."
2,Kid-proof not for long,"I thought this was a great product until my child turned three. All of a sudden he figured out how to snap the thing in half. Then when my second child became two years old, he figured it out immediately."
1,Horrible!,"I was trying to find similar safety door knobs like we bought a few years ago. Not being able to find the exact kind, I opted to buy these. They are difficult to use and fall off the door handle constantly. Both of mine are now in the trash."
3,"""Ok product""",For the most part they do there job. Sometimes my 2 1/2 yr. old son can get these apart. They make it hard for my 67 yr. old mother to open the door. I don't have a problem with them myself. I don't regret buying them.
2,Business Cards,"At $30 this is a fine product for someone who does not want to design a card as the only changes that can be made to the several thousand cards are in the name, phone number and address. The location of text can not be changed and graphics can not be imported. Once I realized that this was not a program for me I deleted it and manually had to delete the extra fonts added by this program as my OS complained about too many fonts. My Print Shop program is more versatile."
4,It could be better,"The case is a bit too large and the battery could last longer as the one that comes with the camcorder, but the price is great for a kit.In the botton line, it pays off."
5,Great value!,"I got a brand new carrier, and battery for a great price. I would buy from Amazon and this dealer anytime."
3,sony bag,i bought this item seeing the picture on the net...the product is absolutely fine but the only thing is that it is too much for my handycam.. mine is a sony sr42 handycam and the bag is very large for my cam and have to fill the bag with cables to compensate the empty space... battery is doing fine
3,Satisfying buy a growing concern,"This bag looks nice, feels nice and fits my SR300 neatly. One really sad thing is their buckle. It looks so flimsy, and if it ever breaks we an throw the whole bag away.Thats the weakest point of this bag, which I somehow feel was done intentionally for marketing skills."
5,Nice accessory kit for our Sony camcorder,"We've been very happy with this accessory kit for our Sony HDR-SR12 Handycam camcorder. Comes with all sorts of useful goodies. Great buy, if only for the spare battery and carrying case together."
4,"Nice combo, bigger than it appears in photos","Recently got this product as an accessory to my Sony HDR-SR11 camcorder...Pros:======1. Oodles of space. I could pack everything from my Sony Camcorder's box (cables,dock,remote ctrl etc, except CDs) into this case still leaving space to pack some more.2. Good build quality, has adequate padding inside to protect the camcorder from regular bumps. Also looks like it should withstand normal rains without an issue .I have to yet check the Battery but the one that came with my Sony wears out real fast so its better to go for this spare which has been reviewed to be long lasting one ...Cons:======None except the size. Its a bit bulky to lug around, kinda like a photographer's bag. All in all pretty practical if a little bulk around your camcorder doesn't make you too uncomfortable. I am happy with the purchase ..."
5,L'Oreal Paris Couleur Experte Express-Med. Blonde/Toasted Coconut,"I wanted to make my hair darker blond for the fall with lighter highlights. This hair coloring kit did exactly that. The instructions were clear and everything you needed was in the kit. The finger brush that came with the kit made it easy to add highlights. Depending on how many strands of hair you cover, you can go from subtle highlights to bold ones. The conditioner in the kit was also excellent, leaving my hair soft and shiny. I was very pleased with the color. I was worried that the highlights would be too brassy but they were soft gold and very pretty. I really was able to do this myself. If you want to achieve a medium blonde shade with gold highlights, this is the kit for you. I would recommend doing this over two days, first applying the darker all-over color, and then adding the highlights to dried and styled hair the next day so that you can see exactly where you want your highlights."
1,"""76% savings""? On what planet?","This stuff retails for like $15 in the local drugstore chains like Longs and Walgreens. Who is charging $44 for it? Nobody. Where does Amazon get this phoney baloney pricing? There's no ""savings"" here!Word to the wise: Use Amazon to comparison shop, but don't blindly take their word for anything."
3,The color came out not as shown on the box,The color came out much darker than the box (factory mixup?) BUT it did cover my grays and i like the way it looks.
1,Eh not so much for me,"I was very excited to use this product. I love the L'Oreal Feria hair color line and thought this color was very pretty and the highlighting that was gonna come with it was going to make it extraordinary but, I was wrong. This color turned my hair orange. Not a bright pumpkin orange but orange none the less and the highlighting step didn't work for me at all. The mixture was way too thick that I could barely get it on my hair, not to mention get it on evenly. Once I did manage to get it on the best I could I left it on for about 30 - 45 mins and nothing. Didn't give me any sort of highlight. I had to re-color my hair with some tube color I had because it didn't look nice at all. Maybe this particular one wasn't right for me but I won't be buying this product again."
3,L'oreal Couleur Experte is ok,"The highlights turned out a bit orangy. They were orangy for a while, then got blonde. I would only use this product again to use the first step color-the dark blonde."
2,Not what I expected AT ALL!!!,"My hair was colored a medium blonde before coloring. I wanted a more natural color, so I chose ash thinking it would neutralize the possible reds from my hair. After the first step - applying the color only, my hair turned a lot darker, a medium brownish, no blonde at all, with a little orangey roots. I thought the highlights might help, so I applied the highlights the same day, after I let my hair dry first. It was worse. The highlights turned out orange. I'm going to have to use a different product now, maybe a semi-permanent color to cover the orange at least, and bring the hair to one color at least.Will not buy this product again, it obviously doesn't have enough lift power, and it will bring out every red you might have in your hair. Plus the ammonia smell was so strong...It's better to stick with salon brands, that are higher quality, especially when wanting your hair blonde."
1,list price,"Where on earth is this product listed as $44.60?I have seen this product anywhere from $15 - $21.00, butnot $44.60. I think the 59% savings listed here is hugelyinflated and makes me suspicious of the other ""savings""offers offered by Amazon. I'm not saving $26.47 on this product!Maybe, if anything one or two dollars.GET REAL!!!or I will shop elsewhere!!!"
4,Beautiful color,"This product was easy to apply, however, I mixed it with another hair color, so I can't say for sure how true the color is. I do love the highlight results that I achieved."
1,Not As Easy As It Looks and Highlights Looks Brassy,"The base color was good but applying the highlights was very difficult and messy. Not surprisingly, it looks awful. I am not happy! It came out really brassy and looks very unnatural. I have highlighted my hair before with cap and hook using Clairol's Frost and Tip and that's what I'll go back to for highlights. Now - I've got to try to fix my hair."
1,damaged and incomplete,"The boxed kit was already open when it arrived. Some components of the kit were missing altogether. Product is unusable in the condition in which it arrived, and now I learn that the item cannot be returned."
5,Hair color,"beautiful color and highlights,have enjoyed for a while.I hope they always make this color.because it works so well for my skintone"
4,Love this color,I have been using this color for such a long time. It is getting difficult to find in some of the stores. I hope Loreal won't stop making it. I love doing the highlights at the same time. I get so many compliments. I paid over $150 for color and highlights not too long ago when I got a gift certificate. Less compliments.
1,NOT THE COLOR ON THE BOX IF YOU ARE LT BLONDE!,"I have used L'Oreal hair color for over 20 years. I was a natural blonde, but my hair became dirty blonde as I got older, and now have some gray as well. I usually use Lightest Natural Blonde in the summer, and Light Natural Blonde in winter, and have always been happy with the results. I recently used Natural Blonde Preference 9, as I wanted to go a bit darker, but the color came out ashy and not ""natural"" looking at all.I decided to try Couleur Experte in Toasted Almond. I was looking for a warm, darker blonde with lighter highlights as the result depicted for light blonde hair on the box. I followed the directions exactly, and boy was I disappointed. I wound up instead with some sort of weird greenish, grayish, brownish color. I didn't even bother with the highlights. Will be wearing a baseball cap until my trusted hair dresser can fix me next week:("
2,Did not work well on my roots,"Usually I use Loreal Excellence Creme (light brown #6), but this product did not cover the roots which are 50% gray and very dark brown. I did like the highlighting process which was fairly easy, but the color portion just did not do as good of a job."
4,Great Product,"I have used Dark Golden Blonde/Butterscotch Cream 7.3for over a year. This time I decided to try a highlighting cap to apply the highlights. I am happier with the results than I have ever been in the past! I was able to do most of it myself. My daughter did the back. Through much trial and error,I can say that this is the easiest way to apply the highlights! I have found it very difficult to do this ANY other way. Wish I had thought of it sooner!"
4,Damaged packaging,"I LOVE this haircolor and have used it for many many years with spectacular results. I am often complimented on how natural the highlights look, even by my stylist.I gave the product 4 rather than 5 stars since I suspect that the product supplied to me by this outside-of-Amazon vendor may have unknowingly been a 'knock-off' product, OR very old OR subject somewhere to intense heat/cold. All of the plastic containers cracked with minimal and gentle handling spilling product everywhere. More importantly, the product didn't seem to color my roots as well as it has done in the past. Maybe this was a one-time fluke.....Despite the savings through Amazon, I will not purchase this again via this outside vendor. Back to the drug store"
2,"Easy, you say? Not!","I bought this when the price of salon highlights started going through the roof. Really thought I'd have a better experience considering how ""easy"" it was supposed to be. Definitely hard to use, sloppy, and made weird stripes of orange appear in my hair. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I consulted the color guide and according to it, I was using the right shade. I'm going back to my hair colorist (even if I have to take out a loan)...."
4,"Fun, not as pictured, gentle","Almost but not quite 4 stars due to major difference between results and package pic.I like this color, which is a good thing since it is not as pictured- unfortunately it would require some lowlights to get it to the picture. BUT my hair is really soft and much healthier looking after I dyed it- did NOT expect that! I started with natural dark/medium brown hair and now have a dark red color- not the dark rich brown on the box picture. But the color lets through all the subtle highlights that I already had, so it is not a matte effect. The highlights were easy to apply and did not spread. I have a few greys and they are a brilliant red now- I would suggest placing highlights near any grey-now-RED hair."
1,I HAVE DARK GREY HAIR NOW.,"ok, looking back now, i realize that i should have had a red flag go up about how it was ""discontinued"" but hey i wanted a nice golden blonde color with highlights, seemed the perfect shade on the box. well i get it in my hair and wash it out and ITS DARK GREY. IT IS THE COLOR OF MOPS. THE COLOR OF A SOUL CRUSHING STORM CLOUD. DARK FREAKING GREY MAN. WTF. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE. im gonna have to spend twice as much money fixing this so i can show my face and mop-hair to the world again. DO NOT BUY."
5,Fabulous!,"This poduct is simply the best! It's a natural looking red - meaning not raspberry-ish. People who didn't know me Pre-redhead assume it's my natural color! It's pretty easy to do; I've been doing it for 10 yrs, when my husband cut off my salon color/highlight budget. And ever since I've been doing this & saving over $100/month easily! I get stopped ALL the time, ppl asking me where I get my color done , what exact color it is, etc., tee hee! My ONLY complaint is that this particular shade is very hard to find :( but, I HIGHLY recommend it!!!"
1,Still waiting...,"I read a lot of non-fiction. Once in a while I try to mix in a fiction book. I read the Stephen King review and thought to give this book a shot.I am still waiting to be scared! What is so ""horrifying"" about this book? I will tell you - that it even got published. I only made it through because once I start something I have to finish. The characters are unlikeable, the plot predictable, the big scary threat is humorous - not scary. I was waiting for some surprise at the end.I am still waiting. I am glad I got the book from the library and didn't spend money on it. Terrible."
1,The HOSTEL / SAW of novels,"Have you ever thought to yourself that you would like to read a long, detailed novel about 6 little white mice--cute, fluffly little white mice*--being thrown in a cage with a big hungry snake and then spend a few hundred pages following the action as seen from the mice's point of view. No? Me either. I wish I'd read some of the 1 star reviews here before i wasted a weekend on this snuff novel.*The characters are so underwritten that they actually have a conversation about what cliche character from the movies each of them would be. And that's the most detail we really get about them."
1,worst.... book..... ever,"My high hopes for this book were dashed about a third of the way through. While the Smith's writing style is excellent he wastes his talent with a story that is oddly predictable, if not a bit disgusting. The book adds nothing to the conversation about the human condition in the way King or Bradbury do. I finished the book thinking ""please, no...please, no"" not out of horror for the fates that befall the characters, but because it slowly dawned on me that I'd wasted my afternoon. Stay far away from The Ruins."
2,not impressed,Found it shallow and more like a pitch writer looking for a filmaker buyer. Had the suspense of opening the prize in a cracker jack box. After the review I read on amazon expected a whole lot more from it. I should have waited for it in paper back at the doctors office free book exchange.
2,"Ugh, a rerun of an old SciFi genre","If you have seen The Day of the Triffids, then this book will be a let down. The books starts slow, peaks with some action about halfway, then starts to repeat itself over and over in the last half of the book. Ignoring the improbable in the guise of science fiction, the characters do not make sense. There appears to be no survival instinct in any of them. They sit on top of mine shafts, yet never explore them. Wind is blowing through the tunnels but they never think to find out from where it is coming. You can skim the last 100 pages and not miss a thing. And worst nothing is explained about the ruins, the Mayans, or the plant. Want a scarey book? Go buy Stephen King's ""It."""
4,Creepy and engrossing,"I understand some of the criticisms of the Ruins, but I would recommend reading this book with an open mind and you might just find yourself caught up in it, like I was. The book starts a little slow but takes off about halfway through...some horrifying situations throughout and I started to feel the characters' frustrations and growing sense of doom as the book progressed. I can't say that the characters were particularly deep or well-fleshed out, yet I think Smith gave them just enough depth that we DO begin to commiserate with them by the end. There were some very memorable and tense scenes that will be forever etched in my mind. I'm not sure that this is the best horror novel of the new century, but I certainly found it to be an engrossing read and I believe it will make a very good movie as well."
2,Oh No! Killer Ivy!,"Jaws made you afraid to go into the water. Psycho made you afraid to take a shower. The Ruins will make you afraid to visit your local arboretum.SPOILER ALERT.To be fair, the writing is pretty intense, particularly in the begining, but once I found out that the weed was the killer, I wanted to know why. Unfortunately, there is no answer, it's just a killer weed. That's it.I realize that not knowing the backgroud of a villian can be even more scary. I thought Darth Vader and Leatherface were much more terrifying before all of the sequels and prequels ruined all of the mystery. On the other hand, we're talking about a killer plant here, It's not scary to begin with.Even though I don't think this book is that great, I still don't think it is as bad as everyone else seems to think. I kind of like the fact that the ending is such a downer. I would say that if your favorite movie of all time is ""Open Water"" then this book is right up your alley, otherwise, you'll probably want to pass."
2,King WOULD like this,"For one thing, it is FAR too long. It should have been a short story, or a novella at most. Smith writes well, but from the beginning, we know what is going to happen, it takes too long to get there.For another, this reads as if it were a movie. It's the typical kind these days, and if you've seen one, you've seen them all.I got the jist, then skipped to the end. That was enough. No surprises. I feel like I've pretty well wasted my time on this one.Pegleg"
3,the ruins,"Interesting book,something different to read.I had to keep reading waiting for the end to come. The end came! Not an ending just a drop off. If I had known that I would have read the first few pages, skipped the middle go straight to the ending. That's just my opinion. I should have read a good murder mystery."
3,Good and not so good,"I read Scott Smith's A Simple Plan and loved it. Smith is an extremely gifted writer, able to probe the human mind like very few writers are able to. As for The Ruins, honestly, I thought it would have been perfect if the ""creeping horror"" wasn't man-eating vines. Man-eating vines!? I'm sorry, but this is really pathetic like some crappy Sci-Channel flick after 10pm. The first half or so without the vines is great stuff and Smith's evocation of suffocating despair is a delight to absorb and heart rending events in The Ruins goes from bad to worse to horrible. Read the novel for Smith's style and everything else except for the vines. (What I don't get is how an author like Smith or any author, cannot write for 12 years. This is probably more frustrating than man-eating vines.)"
2,How much were people paid to endorse this book?,"It's really hard to believe the kind words from Stephen King and the book services about this book.It is average at best, and I fail to see the 'horror' in a vine.What I DO like is this may be the first book I have ever read that required ZERO research on the part of the author. There is no history, no technological explanations, no geography. I think if anything this book should be used as a learning tool for young writers that shows you can just write a book and have people talk the whole time. That's pretty amazing."
4,'Ruined Lives',"I really enjoyed this well-written and suspenseful book and while I didn't read it in one sitting, I did read it in four big chunks. For me, the thrill was figuring out page by page what was going to happen to each of the very realistic characters--and then being wrong. Like other reviewers, I thought it was going to be related to the Maya. I was wrong about that too. So the book defies expectations. Kudos to Mr. Smith."
1,"Well, this book certainly sucked","First, this book was recommended to me via e-mail from Borders Book Store. Amazon had a better price and had it in stock.However, when I saw Steven King giving it a thumbs up on review pages I should have dropped all ideas of buying but I was intrigued by the title...THE RUINS. I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones type stories and I thought this book was headed that way into the dark labrinyth of secret passages and bad South American priests.Well, there are no ruins. The only ruin was the book itself: a waste of trees. The story line is like thin soup and there is no depth to the characters. It reads like a ""what I did on my summer vacation"" written by a bored summer school student and I found myself flipping through pages hoping to find something exciting in the story.So five young tourists die on a hill side eaten by a plant. Wow. What a story line. Thats all folks. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Possibly one of the worst,"This is possibly one of the worst books I've finished. I guess in ""horror"" you have to watch the characters do dumb things. This book is no exception (though I admit I was rooting for some characters more than others, which must mean something). It's almost at the level of ""I know, let's split up"". I'd point out a few examples but it would give stuff away. Also the monster is just un-believable. I think the writer owes us a little bit more explanation about how it could come to be than the clueless, unconvincing speculations of our heros and sheros. Finally, it's hard to believe that its future prospects are good. One of these days someone's gonna show up with a working cellphone, an automatic weapon, or a container of paraquat - and then the game's over.Oh yeah, why did I finish it? My wife was telling me how scarey it was. I thought if I kept reading, I'd get to that part (it never came)..."
2,Huh?,"There wasn't a single character I came close to liking in this book (well, maybe the happy Greek - he didn't speak a word of English). The whole story just seemed so dumb. A killer vine?? That sings?? And mimics humans?? I just didn't get the story (and honest, I'm not a stupid guy) - what was the relationship between the Mayans, the archaeologists, the vines and the bunch of unlikable dopes, uh, I mean, characters? Don't waste your time."
1,Disgusting,"This has got to be the most horrible book I have ever read. I am an avid reader and can get through Stephen King books without a problem. This book is just plain evil! I had my husband burn it for me so that it would not be in my house. I love books and would not consider burning them, except for this one! JackieB."
2,Disappointed,"I have been waiting for years for Scott Smith to write another book. I think A Simple Plan was one of the best books I have ever read. I was extremely disappointed with The Ruins. Killer vines--come on! Beyond ridiculous. Please, Mr. Smith, go back to at-least-possible fiction!"
1,Make it into a movie,"You'd be better off wasting an hour and a half on a B-grade horror movie than a whole afternoon or evening actually reading this book. Yeah, I get the premise, roads not taken, life turning out differently than you thought, etc. But please, these characters had to work really hard at getting themselves into the life-and-death situation they face, much like the horror film actress who opens the creepy door into the attic when you know nothing good can come from it. I'd pass on this one."
2,A disappointment - was hoping for so much more from Scott Smith,"This book is like an extended version of a Stephen King short story that King pecked out on his typewriter in about 45 minutes. When I first read the summary about a month before The Ruins was released, I was expecting a more complex story and not just a basic horror story. Not that there's anything wrong with horror stories. But they need to have more substance. And the basic concept of The Ruins, or the ""monster"", is pretty dumb.It's hard to explain exactly why the book is a disappointment without giving away spoilers, but suffice to say, this book doesn't hold a candle to A Simple Plan, which was horrifying and compelling and engrossing in all the ways that The Ruins is not. I feel pretty cheated to have spent $17 on the ebook, which I can never print or share with anyone else. But that's my fault for not waiting for it to be available at the library for free."
2,Just skip this book,"I have NEVER written a negative review about a book before, but I am actually annoyed that I wasted 3 evenings of my life on The Ruins. I read it based on Stephen King's recommendation (I LOVE his work), and I cannot TELL you how disappointed I was. This is just not a good story. Period. I'm an AVID reader, so I feel like I'm a pretty good judge. I've read work by all different types of authors (like Clive Cussler, Michael Crighton, Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Erik Larson, Annette Shreve, Pat Conroy, Ken Follett, Nicholas Sparks, etc.), and I read quite a bit that shows up on the NY Times Best Seller List. The Kite Runner is one of the best books I've read in five years. It's with great regret that I must say The Ruins is one of the worst."
4,AMAZING!,Not sure what is going on with people but this book was great! Heard it on audio book and loved it. It's 6 hours on audio book and ya finish it in no time.Highly recommended!
2,300 Pages Too Long,"Not much of a story, less than interesting characters and simply not very well written. That about says it all."
2,Disappointing,The ending was disappointing. It could have been a 30pg short story and been just as affective.
4,"sad, claustrophobic and scary","I think those who feel this book is a better short story than a novel are used to reading James Patterson books, where there are three page chapters that lead to cliffhangers every time. I find Patterson very entertaining, but The Ruins made me squirm, and think about how I'd react to the situation. Admittedly, it sounds silly to describe it to someone else, but reading it was convincingly horrifying. I thought the characters were well drawn. We're given interesting flashes of insight about them, and I was fascinated by how quickly the group's survival instincts broke down. There's definitely unanswered questions, but that's what's so scary to me. Not knowing makes it creepier. I think if there'd been a final confrontation with a discovered central foe, it would've made the novel trite. I recommend this book highly, but not for someone who doesn't want to be stuck thinking about some seriously unsettling images when finished."
2,Very disappointing...........,"I guess my expectations were too high. I was expecting something of the caliber of ""A Simple Plan"". This is nothing more than a script for a teenage horror flick.Even the ending reminds me of so many horror movies.I can't believe that this is the result of 12 years of work.Now THAT's scary! ;)"
1,"Probably the Dumbest ""Horror"" Novels I've Read","Don't let the title ""The Ruins"" fool you into thinking this story involves ancient Mayan ruins, with maybe some kind of supernatural, demonic presence. It is about 6 knuckleheads on a barren hill getting attacked by - a vine. Yes, a thinking, talking, flesh-eating vine with little red flowers that creeps onto them anytime they lose any bodily fluids. I kept waiting for some type of explanation on this thing, but it never came. Don't waste your time with this. I can't imagine that the movie coming out will be any better."
1,"Visceral, gory, ultimately disappointing","This book was a disappointment. I read all the great reviews of it so perhaps my expectations were set too high. There was just a lot of blood and other bodily fluids and it wasn't very scary at all. The only reason I finished listening to it was to find out if anyone survived, even though by the end I really could not have cared less about the characters. If you really want to read this, I'd suggest checking it out at the library where it's free."
1,Waste of time and money,"For the life of me I cannot understand Publisher's Weekly giving this book a starred review. I gave up halfway through it and normally I hang on till the bitter end. But in this case I was bored to tears and didn't want to waste any more time on it.The book was boring, the plot repetitive, the horror tedious, and the characterization inane. I generally agree with Stephen King but not in this case."
2,Just too implausible ...,"I thought the situation was interesting and the character development was good, but the villian in this story a vine that can lay traps, read minds, pick up things and move them around, and speak both english and german. I actually got pretty engossed in the story sometimes, but then suddenly the magic vine was mimicking one characters voice, saying exactly the things that would most likely cause conflict with another character, and I'd pop out of the story and think, ""Oh, come on...""Another complaint is that early in the story, Eric is being lowered into a shaft and he sees a tunnel to the side that holds promise for escape. Apparently he forgets about it and its never mentioned in the story again.The story held a lot of promise, but now I feel that reading it was a waste of time."
4,Interesting but predictable,"The story is very intense, but the end made me question myself why I was reading the book. In my opinion, it lacked logical explanation about the events-it looked too impossible to happen."
2,Loses its way,"Completely peters out about the halfway mark, when you've seen everything there is to see and know exactly how the last 150 or so pages will proceed. Maintains a nice, creepy atmosphere for that first half (despite a complete lack of characterization), but once you discover what's going on it's just a slow countdown to each bloody death.In movie terms, this is (far) less 'The Shining' than it is a 'Hostel' or a 'Saw.' If you're into cartoon sadism, go for it. If you're into subtle spooks, just read the first half - you'll know what comes next."
2,Don't waste your money,Bought this because of King's review... Skipped through most of the last half not interested in the development of his characters as they talk and think to themselves. It was too late for that.
2,This is NOT the Yucatan!,"I have no idea why Scott Smith chose the Yucatan Peninsula for this novel. It could be set in any of the other various mysterious places on earth and the story would remain the same. As a regular visitor to this magnificent locale, I found nothing recognizable here, and in fact, found many discrepancies in the descriptions of the terrain, flora, fauna and the Maya people. Shame on you, Mr. Scott, for not having visited or better researched the Yucatan."
2,Great concept but missed opportunities,"I was excited about reading a book set in Coba after having spent time climbing the ruins and learning everything there is to know about the Mayans. My husband and I are probably the only people to visit the Mayan Museum in Cancun. I was also curious how the author would make a vine into an adversary. Scott Smith accomplishes the task of setting up man vs. nature,but I wanted more Mayan intrigue and biology teasers. I think he failed in his task of developing man vs. man. What was the purpose of setting us up for a survival story when it only goes downhill? The women were so annoying and pointless. It is my personal nightmare to be trapped for in the jungle with three whining yuppies."
2,Ho-hum,Implausible one review states and implausible it is. There is a lot to be scared of in this world but plants that talk and eat people and play tricks just doesn't do it for me. Stephen King said this book scared him....hmmmm.....what does that say about Mr.King?
1,The Most Horrible Book EVER,"If the only problem with this book was the excruciatingly drawn-out storytelling style, I'd be enticed to give this book 2 stars. But the stupid premise of the story and the relentless description of disgusting deaths, told in the style of pre-teens trying to out-gross each other at horror stories around a camp fire really pushed this book into the trash heap. It was dumb and pointless. Find something else better with which to waste your time."
2,i felt completely empty at the end,"i didn't want to read the reviews prior to reading this book. i felt that stephen king's review was evidence enough to check it out. i felt that the premise of the story had great potential but i felt that scott smith left you feeling flat and empty, as if nothing had been accomplished. i was intrigued by the possibility that i was going to led into a mayan ruin with a deep and horrific past. all i got was a bunch of blood thirsty vines. and WAY too much delving into the meandering minds of the main characters! i kept turning the page expecting something suspenseful to happen and i never got it. i still plan on reading a simple plan because it seems to be a much better example of scott smith's handy work."
3,Imaginative but hollow,"Warning--this review will give away key happenings in the novel. Interesting & imaginative story about a group of college-aged kids trapped on a hill, one-by-one falling victim to a voracious plant, thanks in part to Mayan locals who are determined to keep them stuck there. You figure out pretty early on who the villain in the novel is & how others have fallen prey prior to them, but the unraveling of a mystery ends there. No explanation of the plant's origins, no clues in the archaeologists' tent, which is what I'd expected. Also I kept thinking to myself that they'd use fire to their advantage, since it worked in the mine shaft, and that's what kept me reading this novel, but that never happens & instead a bloodbath ensues. So it was a page-turner for me, but for all the wrong reasons. Also I thought the talking, laughing plant was ridiculous. Interesting concept but limited by a hollow plot, predictably morbid ending, and no one's surprised that the Greeks finally arrived."
2,"Stephen, What Were You Thinking?","Setting aside Stephen King's head-scratcher of an endorsement, this isn't much more than an overextended survivalist story with an unimpressive monster thrown in for good measure. Take away the monster, substitute a desert island for the ruins, and the only thing that would change about the book would be its length. (If you've read it, you'll understand.) It kept me reading through the end, which is something; but it ultimately feels like a cheap knock-off of Dean Koontz's ""Phantoms."" It wasn't worth the five or so hours I invested in it."
1,"Creepy leaves and vines and sap, Oh My","Ranks right down there with the worst ever. If it receives a good review from Steven, Turn 'Em Out By The Dozen, King it's GOTTA be bad. And to think they chop trees down to make the paper on which this tripe is written. Disgraceful !!"
1,The Ruins,"Basic premise of book is a bit unbelievable, just shy of ridiculous. Character development was good and it was a page turner; however, had the evil element of the book been something believable, such as a government agency conducting testing with dangerous chemicals, it would have been a much, much better read. Scott Smith's previous book, A Simple Plan, was terrific, as I could envision myself acting as any one of the main characters acted. In The Ruins, however, Scott Smith asks us to believe in the unbelievable. Perhaps Sci-Fi readers would enjoy The Ruins."
2,Page Turner? And how!,"I read the first 25 or so pages and then scimmed the rest. Pages turned like mad! You know these young people are doomed from almost the beginning of this book- stolen hat and sunglasses in blistering heat of tropical jungle country, lost insect repellent, paths leading nowhere with people they don't know who speak languages they don't have a clue about. Just a question of time until they are all dead. For supposedly smart people they are so very dumb. And we're not much interested in just how they blunder into the increasingly pointless horror after a short time. A murderous vine?! This book is a bent way of heaping horror on horror to more than 50 ways to kill your lover bit by bloody bit. Yuck."
2,Art for sadists,"Not an actual story, more the slow description of people dying in improbable circumstances. Other reviewers have pointed out the logical flaws and plot holes, but there's also the author's bumbling prose and the lack of explanation: what are these vines? Why do the natives trap people there when it'd be so much easier just to kill the prisoners and feed them to the vine?Interesting that Stephen King calls it the ""best suspense novel since Silence of the Lambs"". About as suspensful as a butcher's shop or watching surgery, pure slasher."
3,AVERAGE,"This book was very suspenseful and easy to read but the ""mystery"" of the horror is too easy to figure out. Also it went a little too far. You could almost believe that because of some organic mutation what happens in this book could really happen. But he takes it to far when he implied that the veins were copying the voices of the victims.Plants eating people = acceptable. Plants Talking = not acceptableWith that said I really enjoyed the ending!"
2,Awfully Entertaining? NO. Just Awful.,"I was very excited about this book, being a fan of his earlier book. I must say though, I was more than a little disappointed. The book just doesn't do what it could have. I guess my biggest complaints are that most of the characters are just too annoying to want to spend any time with. That, and the suspense seems disjointed and improperly set up, only to lead nowhere. But the biggest problem of all is that the plot is simply way too ridiculous to even attempt to buy into. After finishing this book, I was just happy to be done with it. This book does not deserve a movie, or the attention being paid to it."
2,"...""can you hear me now?!?...""","okay, i really liked the book 'a simple plan' and yes, was excited and alerted by stevie's rave review of 'the ruins'.butt!!!...i'm not a cell phone person...never had one, probably never will...however, i'm literally and loudly surrounded by them, annoyingly so...so, please sir scott, there's NO WAY IN MAYAN RUIN HELL that NOBODY!!!, not just the six kids most recently trapped there (somewhat explained away feebly) but most certainly SOMEONE in the archaeological crew would have had at least ""juan""......that's not even mentioning the fact that most phones now have picture-taking capabilities...wouldn't ANYONE, esp. the kids, make sure they're getting a photo-op outta most situations?!?...the scientists?!?...hmmm...lap-top computers, anyone...!?!big holes in the plausibility of this plot point sink it simply, plainly..."
1,What a waste of time...,"I give this book one star because in the 123 pages I've read so far I haven't found any typos. I rushed to get this book because it came highly recommended by my favorite author (you know who you are). I very rarely put a book down unfinished but I have wasted too much time already. Zero character development, snail paced story telling. I've gotten almost to the halfway point and still nothing exciting or ""horrific"" has happened."
1,The Ruins,"I Stopped reading it on page 31. I gave it to my sister to read, she finished it and said I had to read it. She said the book was very different. She would not recommend it. We both liked his previous book ""A Simple Plan"". This book was way far out. Will try it again. I Think??????"
3,Where's The Beef,"Throughout most of the Ruins we have all this great character development (Though one Amazon reviewer felt it very little, he must've read the abridged version), and awesome story telling, not too much is revealed, we are left to figure out most of the back story concerning the vines ourselves, which I enjoyed. There's about 550 pages of awesome storytelling.(SPOILER)Then in the last 50 pages it all drops, all of a sudden everyone dies, and the climax, is well pretty lackluster. There just should have been more there."
4,Lives up to the hype but ...,"I read this book after hearing several friends tell me that it was a great thriller. I ususally do not go in for what is popular. I read this with an open mind over the winter. The movie was out at the same time and I kept me imagining what the movie was like. Also, I have been to the Yucatan and wandered in the underbrush (not a place for tourists). Mr. Smith's writing and tale-spinning were able to overcome these facts. Wow! I enjoyed it but have one warning. The book will make you cry out ""NO STUPID! DON'T DO THAT!"" It is this type of reading experience that pulls in a reader. The only critisms I have is that the writer leaves us with the winpiest character as the last victim and we never get to know any of the locals."
2,"It was a fast read, not high literature","It was a fast read. A lot of dialogue over vines and what to do. I actually was somewhat mildly surprised at the ending. It was good to lay outside in the sun, read this book and veg out. Not a book or story you would want to save or reflect on its virtues later. I felt that this book, The Prey, and Deep Water were all about same."
1,"Pathetically Bad, But Who Cares?","I would have given it NO stars if I could have.I liked his first, A Simple Plan. This one is simply appalling. A vine that eats people. What a great idea! Obviously he was writing it with the idea it would be a movie.Ridiculous, unbelieveable plotline, cardboard characters, with the writing really nothing more than boring, unimaginative and predictable exposition, yet, still, over 1000 people have reviewed this horrible book on Amazon alone.It goes to show you that you can write trash, and still sell tons of books, making tons of dough.Scott, you should be ashamed of yourself.I listened to the audio of this, while I was doing other things....I'd never have wasted my time sitting down and reading it."
2,Mindnumbingly Boring!,"I too picked up this book partially because of the King quote and what sounded like an interesting plot. Boy, was I dissapointed. 4 vacationing Americans make friends with a group of foreigners and on a whim decide to help find one of the group's missing brother who left on a supposed dig on ""ruins"" in the middle of the jungle, but has yet to return. What follows is page after page of whining and stupidity. I actually hated all the American characters, who barely have enough brain power between them all to walk up-right. The Greeks they meet are actually creepy. The only person I liked was Mathias. Midway through the book I was praying for someone/something to just kill them all already so I didn't have to hear any more complaining or stupid ideas. Horrible plot, way too slow, characters no one should like and the most intense part for me was trying to finish the book so I could move on to something worth my time and the paper it's printed on. SKIP IT."
2,Not so creepy creepers,"Let me start off by saying that I wanted to like this book. I love horror, and I had high hopes for this one reading the author's other novel, A Simple Plan. But I was disappointed. It just never took off for me, and even by the end of it, I could have cared less about the characters. Ultimately, this probably would have made a decent short story, but as a novel, this is one to miss. One of the book's few redeeming qualities is that it was slightly better than the movie based on it."
3,"Nowhere near ""A Simple Plan""","Scott Smith hit the ball out of the park with __A Simple Plan__ in the 90's. The book was phenomenal, and so was the film (for which he wrote the screenplay).__The Ruins__ is nowhere near the quality of his first novel. The book has pages and pages of long-winded exposition, with little dialogue. It reminds me of Stephen King's later work--terribly over-written. The characters are not sympathetic--they're college age yuppies. We really don't care about them because they're flat characters--unlike the vivid characters in _A Simple Plan_.The premise of the book is great, but if we don't really care about the characters, where is the horror when they have to confront the ""evil"" in the Mexican jungle?_A Simple Plan_ was apparently a single flash of brilliance. Some writers do this: They create one brilliant work, and they can never again match it."
2,Horror for it's own sake...,"THE RUINS is a rather disappointing example of a horror novel that limits itself to just the horror, leaving little room for anything else, Poorly sketched characters head gradually toward their doom; not one individual is described enough detail to develop any compassion toward his or her plight so the reader remain emotionally distant. When left with a lack of any compassion for the characters, the book is dependent on atmosphere and the novelty of the setting to carry it and it turns out that this isn't enough. What you're left with is a good writer trying to make something compelling out of very little. There are some truly grotesque and horrifying set pieces that will provide fleeting thrills, but the lack of interest for the characters makes this nothing more intriguing than any run of the mill entry in the genre and from the author ofA Simple Planit's fair to expect quite a bit more."
2,Distrubing Drama,"This is not a book many people should read. I've liked some of the author's previous works. This one is horrible. It is an extremely dark, disturbing drama that has little sense of purpose. It's like an adult version of Lord of the Flies with a supernatural element. The Ruins is a mistitle and should have been called The Vine. The group and groups of people captured on the hill by a supernatural force are intelligent people who never once try to attack their predator. I kept asking myself ""why don't they try to attack back?"" Most of us fight when faced with death. This book is pessimistic and hopeless. Why waste your time on such a message? Clyde R. Horn"
1,"Feed Me, Seymour!","It's been 13 years between his first, great book (""A Simple Plan"") and this, his second, and all Scott Smith could come up with is a retread of the musical ""Little Shop of Horrors"" minus the songs and jokes. The laughs in this book are, I'm certain, completely unintentional. Are we seriously supposed to get the chills over the threat of a killer weed? I'm not sure what grand theme Mr. Smith is attempting to illuminate here. Can it be that the vine is a metaphor for his many fans who, no doubt, will feel utterly disappointed about Mr. Smith's pointless, nihilistic story?"
2,Ruins - a Long ways to go for a somewhat empty read.,"Maybe I was expecting too much from Scott Smith's The Ruins. I loved his previous novel A Simple Plan and was excited to delve into what critics were calling ""the best horror novel of the new century.""And yet...I just didn't get it.At 509 pages The Ruins feels like it could have been told easily in under 200 pages. Not much truly happens. The story has 6 characters essentially trapped in a confined area of the jungle and yet it took far too long for 4 of these characters to even be partially fleshed out. The 5th and 6th characters never get the chance to become anything more than background.Still with each turn of the page I kept hoping for something more and was always met with disappointment. I hear the movie is worse than the book so that makes the decision to skip it easier.If you're a fan of tight-paced horror stories, you probably want to look some place else. The Ruins just misses on every level."
3,The Ruins,"Fast read. Page turner for sure. I would have liked more history about the Mayans, but it was a thrilling story."
1,Most depressing book I've ever read,"It's not that I don't like horror novels, King is one of my favorite authors, it's just that this book, simply put, is a MAJOR bummer novel. From beginning to end, one bad thing after another, one sick thing that just gets sicker, gross, depressing, not even a sliver of an ending that is begrudginly satisfying. A ""novel"" that runs on and on with without even a chapter break. Ugh, not going to invest a dime in this author again.I'd give it a zero if there were an option here ......"
1,Wow! What a Disappointment,"If you are looking for more of the same out of Smith because you enjoyed ""A Simple Plan"", please don't make the same mistake I did and waste any of the precious hours of your life reading this argument for succumbing to writer's block. This is an attempt at a physchological/horror thriller and it's a badly failed attempt."
1,Baaad Book....very bad,"1/4 star!!This book is just plain BAD. It reads like a manuscript.The characters are poorly,no, not developed at all really;and the little there is in the way of development makes you not care what happens to them. It got great reviews how I dont know?? It has been of a dozen years since ""A Simple Plan"" that was a GREAT book.. this book dispite all the acolades just plain SUCKS. There is something to be said for having a library card!I wish I had read the reviews here first I would have saved $8 bucks..."
1,why is this awful thing so successful???,"Reads worse than a script for a Saturday night SciFi channel original movie. Giant people-eating plant, bunch of lame characters, and no ruins! Yech."
1,A Disappointment,"Far fetched tale of misbegotten woe that makes no sense whatsoever,talented, tinkling little flowers and all that......The ending is a total cop out..."
2,I expected better,"Okay for a vacation read. It started out well, but fizzled towards the end. The characters have their distinct personalities, but don't expect any character development. The ethnic stereotypes are tiresome (the Maya, the Greeks, the Germans). A bit like Halloween or Friday the 13th, only with a plant as the slasher--you know each is going to get it, you're just not sure exactly how. Better luck next time."
5,Incredible Novel!,"Wow, this guy is talented. He isn't very prolific - if I'm not mistaken, this is his first book since A Simple Plan - but when he produces, it's something of substance.This is one of the best horror novels I've ever read.Don't let my use of the word ""horror"" turn you off. Yes, it has the basic trappings of a horror novel, but it's so much more! The characters, the moral dilemmas, everything adds up to a deep, meaningful read that you'll be thinking about for days and days.A movie is inevitable, I would think, and I would personally love Sam Raimi to direct.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for any serious reader."
1,Don't bother,"The first half was good, but the second half was awful, it made me wish I hadn't bothered to read it."
1,"Lame, boring, ridiculous...you get the picture.","I opened this book with high hopes and an open mind. I was ready to be terrified. Unfortunately, The Ruins never failed to disappoint me from start to finish. I won't go into details in case someone still wants to suffer through this boring book, but let me just say the heroes are significantly stupider than a flowering vine. Please, don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,This book stinks,"I enjoyed this author's first book. I read or listen to approximately 100 books per year. This is one of the worst books I have encountered recently.The characters are poorly drawn. The book is depressing without any redeeming features. I finished the audio CD only because I kept thinking there had to be something clever or profound that would occur. Instead I was ""treated"" to non-stop, poorly described, repetitive, and grim horror that was not particularly frightening."
4,Eli Roth fans....READ ON,"If you are a fan of the gory, unstopping, unrelenting horror films of Eli Roth, read on! A great beach read, this book will keep you on the beach - and out of the jungles forever! As our troop of tourists traverses away from their resort vacation, they inadvertently stumble into a jungle terror that they cannot escape. Whatever you think might happen next, hang on because the twists just keep coming. The novel is entertaining and delivers on its promise to keep you on the edge of your seat."
4,Don't read this book in your garden!,"The detail in the characters, places and events in this book are fantastic! It's a great read BUT.. what starts off as creepy and suspensful soon becomes rather sickening and terrifying. Still, I couldn't put it down even when my stomach was churning! A very clever novel."
2,Silly and Totally Implausible,"While the book was compelling, it was also very silly (i.e. contrived and unbelievable). Then there's the gratuitous violence and sensationalism, and you end up with a potboiler. It's fun, but it's totally ridiculous."
2,Title Is Misleading,"I found the book equivalent to a script for a bad B movie. The title has nothing remotely to do with the premise of the novel. It is a cross between Little Shop of Horrors and a bad teen slasher flick. If I were in this book, I would have killed myself because of the bad writing before the plants could feast on me. There was no real character development, just a group hurling insults at each other and boring flashbacks, while they waited for their numbers to be called as plant food. The best part of this book was the knowledge I had finished it at last, and I was free from the torture of reading this book."
1,A lot of build-up with no pay-off whatsoever,"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this should have been a short story- might have made for a creepy Paul Bowlesian one.I could tell within the first 100 pages where the build-up was going nowhere and kind of lost trust in the author. I could tell that ""the plants did it,"" and the protagonists were not worth staying with for the duration, so I had to put it down. Looks like I made the right decision."
1,Horrifyingly Bad,"The horror of this book lies in how dreadful it is. The story is incredibly stupid. Some tourists wander off into the jungle with no money, no supplies, no guide, and having told no one where they are going. They all deserve to die."
1,Yuck!,"How can anyone think this is a gripping page-turner? How could you base a major plot device on a communication break-down? This was not scary in the least, just gross and stupid. The characters were so unpleasant, I found myself rooting for the plant. One of the few books I could not finish, I just read the last page and was not surprised in the least."
1,Arghhh,What a waste of paper. 500 pages about a group of people fighting jungle vines. Thats it. No plot. I can't believe they turned this into a movie.
1,weak,"Can you say, ""Sentence Fragment??"" i couldnt get past the fact that every third sentence from this guy was an incomplete sentence, so i couldnt ever get into the story. just a preference, but using it sparingly would have been better, instead it was extremely annoying. wouldnt recommend."
3,"Thrilling suspense, sadly, non-exsistent plot","I read ""A Simple Plan"", and saw the movie. As the book was so well done, I picked up ""The Ruins"". While itheld my interest and was really suspenseful, I found myself wondering how the author was going to explain hisvillain as I approached the end of the book. Unfortunately, that was not to be. I would recommend this book forthe thrills and chills, just not for those who like their books to have a tidy ending."
2,BORING...,"After reading A Simple Plan, I patiently waited for Scott Smith to dazzle us with another example of his exceptional imagination combined with a page-turning, late-into-the-night read. Alas, what a colossal disappointment tortures us in his second ridiculously tedious effort, The Ruins.Touted as highly intelligent (after all, they are post-grad students), not one idiotic character in this wildly absurd contrivance deserves mention. It vaguely occurred to me that the architects of another equally banal production presented through a divergent distinct medium which attracted a vast weekly audience may owe Scott Smith a smidgen of legitimate credit for their innovative or serendipitous ingenuity in the creation of the series, ""Lost.""Revised: 10/02/2010"
1,Ugh!,"Scott Smith sure has a way with titles. ""A Simple Plan"" was simply brilliant. ""The Ruins"" ruined my day.The problem is not the lack of originality; a novel needn't be original to be good. The difficulty lies in the characterizations. There are three types of characters in fiction: characters who are too smart all of the time (sometimes you can say this about Lee Child's Jack Reacher), characters who are too dumb all of the time, and characters with a more varied, more human intelligence. Every character in ""The Ruins"" is too dumb all of the time, even the stereotypical smart guy. They are so dumb, they deserve to die!"
2,Hollywood & Vine,"The ""Ruins"" will certainly be a movie packed with grossly highlighted special effects. I don't understand the mostly favorable review given by the ""NY Times Book Review"". When do you ever see 6 ""twenty something"" people go anywhere without a cell phone? They do here and without this hiccup we have no story. In my humble opinion ""Ruins"" is a mostly boring and depressing tale that will do for plants what ""JAWS"" did for sharks. You will never look at your garden vines in the same light again. Buy it if you are going to Mexico or South America for a vacation otherwise wait for the library edition."
1,Ridiculous,"The opening chapters seemed promising. A group of young people head into the jungle for what they think will be a simple day trip to find a missing traveler. Knowing how the last ""simple plan"" worked out I settled in for what I thought would be a great read. The villain of the story is ridiculous. As more and more of the vine's evil capabilities are revealed the sillier they seemed to get. Since no one can communicate with the natives - including the author - the reader is never given any background of the vine, the ruins or the people. It's too bad the author felt the need to cross into the supernatural realm - it ruined a perfectly good story."
1,Gross Out Gorefest.,"I was hoping for a smart thriller wrapped in the mystery of the Yucatan. What I got was a sickening gorefest with no redeaming features. I did enjoy ""A Simple Plan"" but this book is no ""Simple Plan."" I did finish the book but only because it was like watching a terrible car crash, you know you should look away but cannot."
1,Time wasted,"This book was a huge disappointment. The author used over 300 pages to say what could have been said in 75. The writing was tedious and boring. Is this a case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" and I'm just not getting it? I couldn't force myself to continue reading past the first 100 pages--after that I just skimmed through to the end."
1,boring and predictable,"So bad. So preditctable. And where are ""the ruins""?I kept waiting for a twist, and explaination..something..but no just one boring gross out scene after another. I love King and don't quite get why he loves this book. It could have made a great short story, where questions are often best left unanswered, but as a novel it's the same scene over and over. Evil plant kills person. BORING."
2,"Not the worst book I ever read, but close.","I really really wanted to like this book. But the story dragged on, I felt trapped by the internal dialogue that the characters had, with little payoff in story advancement. I kept reading the book although I was bored because I wanted to find out how things turned out. Not to spoil it, but I'll never get the time I spent reading this book back."
2,More Depressing Than Scary,"""The Ruins"" is a relentless novel; Scott Smith ratchets the tension up to 11 in the first few pages, and pretty much just keeps it there -- there's no comic relief, no hope, just a trudge to the ending.The characters are wooden; they are more collections of traits than living, interesting people. I can see that Scott Smith was more interested in group dynamics than in individual character development, but the result here is that I didn't care about anyone.Tension without drama doesn't make for a very satisfying read. Honestly, if Stephen King thinks this is the best horror novel of the new millennium (at least, that's what the quote on the cover of this edition claims), then Mr. King's taste has gone downhill."
3,Pretty Average,"I loved Smith's, A Simple Plan. It was one of those books that I knew little about, started on a slow day because it was there, and was amazed at how good it was. A really wonderful yarn! Naturally, I was excited to hear that, at long last, Smith was doing a second novel. I love horror, science fiction, and thrillers so I had high hopes for The Ruins, a book that tries to blend all three. Sorry to say that it is just an average beach book. Not bad, but not a stand out in any way. It had a promising start, but the setting for the drama was just too closed and too limited. The characters were pretty thin as well. And it requires huge suspension of disbelief and a willingness to avoid questions like ""how did this vine get here anyway?"" Oh well, maybe his third book will be as good as his first."
3,"As much as I wanted to love this book,","I just couldn't. Scott Smith's first work, ""A Simple Plan"", was a terrific character study and a look at the banality of evil. No earth shaking revelations about who we are, just a wonderfully written story about what we can become. ""The Ruins"", unfortunately, offers little in the way of characterization and its story about what happens to a group of tourists in Mexico. The machinations of how these tourists become trapped in the ruins is not implausible, just lazy and frankly not particularly terrifying. The characters are not interesting and I didn't care whether they lived or died.In ""A Simple Plan"", I did care about the characters or was at least interested in what happened to them. If you are a completist and just have to read the book than do so. Otherwise, pass by ""The Ruins""."
1,"-20 stars, for the worst book that I have ever read.","I can't believe that I actually finished this book. It was just totally, and utterly horrible. I hated this book, which on the cover says that Stephen King said was one of the scariest books of the decade. This book is about vines that attack people that are stranded on Mayan ruins. Stupid. Vines are not scary!!!!!!! They are stupid!!!!!I don't like telling people what to buy or what not to buy, but I'm going to have to do it here. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLE BOOK!!! It just isn't worth the money or the time.The reason why I gave this book one star was because they wouldn't let me go any lower, otherwise, I would've rated this book so low that it would look like M.C. Hammer's bank acount--in the negatives.Look, I'm just trying to look out for the customers and I have to say that this book was a flop and that I would to have you make the same mistake that I did by buying this book.***DON'T BUY THIS BOOK***"
4,The Ruins,"I bought this book after reading Steven Kings review in one of our local magazines. I just want to say I thought this book was fantastic, it is such an original idea. I loved how it was set in the mexican jungle with backpackers as the main characters. It was exciting and different. It was great from start to finish. I read it one night and have now given it to my 16yo son to read and he is really enjoying it also.Angie (Queensland, Australia)"
2,"Maybe it will make a good movie, but...","Honestly, I had high hopes for this book. And by all means, I HAD to finish. The characters are a bit weak and the entire story revolves around the awful situation they find themselves in, but I really thought the resolution would come. No such luck.It feels absolutely meant for film, but people may be disappointed with the ending."
2,Bloated Short Story,"There's some stuff here that would make Clive Barker ill, but those scenes are few and far between. This book could easily be 150 pages shorter. I kept reading the same scene over and over, without learning anything about the characters as people, and without discovering anything new about their situation. If this book had been, say, 190 pages OR LESS, it would have been much more effective. I saw the ending coming at the half-way point, so, as I read the last page, instead of shock or fear, I simply shrugged, and cast the book aside. Save youself: don't even bother to pick it up."
1,So many good books out there ..,"Geez, what a waste of time this book was. Just plain awful. The whole thing can be summed up in one sentence: A group of young people find themselves kept from leaving a mound covered by a murderous plant -- and then they all die, one by one. That's pretty much it. Meanwhile, you, as the reader, have to endure page after page of description of their interaction, all of which is pretty freaking boring. I wasted a day on this one, and that's a day I won't get back. It went to paperback? And was then made into a movie? Go figure."
2,I don't recommend this,"***** I've got some spoiler info in my review *****I listened to the Unabridged version on audio. Got to the chapter in which Jeff had decided to amputate Pablo's legs ... for no good reason that I could see ... and gave up.I realized that the rest of the book was probably going to be about a fairly likable group of people diddling around in the jungle and dying gruesome, meaningless, deaths,one by one. And that is exactly what the wikipedia article for this book says happens.So, goodbye and good riddance. Interesting that no one really tries to see if the plant can be defeated. And I don't see why the plant didn't kill them all the first night out.I suppose that wouldn't have given us a chance to *enjoy* all the gore.The plot is bad. But, I think the writing is very good. So, I wish the writer good luck and perhaps his next book will be a winner."
2,An ultimately disappointing 'Teenagers Get Into Trouble' story,"The horror cliche exists for a reason: teenagers are fairly dumb creatures. What's interesting about it is that, during the eighties, in terms of plot, this technique was relatively new. In 50s & 60s SciFi-Horror, yes, you had lustful teens getting into trouble, but they typically ended up running to the police and, of course, the adults just didn't believe them. Until, of course, the adults had to confront the enemy themselves, and then, gee golly whiz, them teens were right. This was abused with entertaining results in the 70s and 80s because creators turned the idea on its head. The kids were right, but there were no adults around to help. The result was nudity and plenty of gore. The Ruins tries to use this initial ploy to get the story going, but does nothing with it, and instead, we're left with a preposterously long tale of dumb youngins (none of whom are likable) who end up meeting their well-deserved fate.But that's all."
1,Bored,"Page after page I hoped there would be something, anything more to this book. Five hundred pages later I realized, nope that's it. While the concept had promise, I believe the plot was never written to realize its full potential.Entertaining - certainly, Enthralling - not even close."
1,One of the Worst Books Ever,"This was one of the most boring, bloated books I've ever read. The characters were unlikable and barely developed, the plot was never sufficiently explained, the horror was UTTERLY absent, there was ZERO suspense, and the killer plant was ridiculous. God, 500 pages of 'surely it must get more interesting than THIS?' There weren't even any twists or false hopes."
1,one of the worst books I have ever read,"Stephen King was an idiot to recommend this book. The plot was ludicrous, the characters were lame, the writing was horrible."
4,Captivating,i was transformed into their midest..felt their despair and all the raw feelings of their plight..at times i was hopeful that jeff would come up with something to kill the vine...Its an hour to hour struggle to survive..it seemed so real!!!
1,"Really, Really Bad Book","What ruins? I admit ""The Ruins"" as a title is much more compelling than ""Killer Vines Killing Witless Tourists that No One Will Ever Miss Because They Are Made of Cardboard"" but still...The fact that S. King hyped this book has convinced me that his accident must have jarred his brains loose - either that or he is on the take from the publisher."
1,Hollywood & Vines,"Yup, it'll be a movie for sure.I won't bother reiterating all the other negative reviews, nor will I slog through over three hundred reviews in total... but if no one has mentioned this already--If you want to a thoughtful, well written and frightening story about killer plants, try John Wyndham's Day of the Triffids instead of this swill."
2,Did not like it,"This book is well written. However, I did not like it. It is born of and dies with hopelessness. Not something I like. The characters are well formed and the plot moves along, it is a quick read. I just like upbeat endings."
2,The Ruins,"This book looked interesting, especially because Stephen King has a positive quote on the cover. It was very disappointing. The entire time I was thinking, when will this be over. The worst part is that the book is suppose to be about ancient ruins...or it portrays itself as such but it is not about that at all. I was very disappointed."
4,Good Read,"I've been waiting years for this second book from Scott Smith. I think it was a bit harder to get into that ""A Simple Plan"" was, but once you're in the story, it's a fascinating look at what happens to people when they're faced with a situation that is spiralling out of control. Smith has a fascinating way of making his characters behave, and it makes you wonder if you wouldn't have done the same thing!"
3,Ruined?,"With the hype presented before this books' release, i thought i was in for a real treat. Sadly, this was not the case. I grew up in the south, trapesing through overencompassing kudzu and always thought... what if? What if kudzu was given free reign (it doesnt?)?The vine in this story reminded me of my childhood dreams, but, lacked the finishing touches. for some reason, i expected an ending that follows most of the horror code. An ending with an answer or explanation. we get neither.the horror is there, the charectorization is there (rather formulaic but true to form), but the end is elusive.I give this 3 stars because i was rivited enough to read it in a few days out of anticipation, simply to find out what the heck is up with those vines. But, alas, no answers. In other words, it would have been more fun to trapse through a kudzu infected field in north georgia and make up my own story instead of reading this one."
3,Stephen King competition?,"While I found this book interesting and a page turner, it never gave me nightmares like King does. The psycological aspect of the book was creepy but not terrifying. I enjoyed the book, but the ending was rather unsatisfying. Read this book, but don't expect to lose sleep at night."
1,It's all been said,"I won't waste anyone's time by restating what's wrong with this book, but I want to go on record as saying this is probably the biggest waste of time I have ever spent reading a book."
5,Can't wait for the movie!,"You can tell when I really like a book. It's when I can't put it down, and that's exactly what I did with this one. From start to finish I barely took a break. Shock and disbelief followed each page as the story unfolded. The horror of it stayed with me well into the next few days and still comes back every time I glance at it sitting on my shelf. I read that the film rights have been bought and hopefully the movie will do it justice. It has the potential of taking horror films into a whole new direction instead of the old ""been there, done that"" slasher film."
2,How to Make a Short Story into a Novel,"While not poorly written, the character development is thin and irrelevant emphasizing a sense of dread at the expense of empathy. For some reason the author drives us down a single path with a predictable outcome effectively removing any sense of tension. I stayed with the story convinced that Smith would be artful enough to introduce some twist to justify the popular critical reviews. Unfortunately the story comes across with all the excitement and interest of a terminal tooth ache."
2,A cut below previous novel,"I found this novel to drag along with an unbelievable premise. I would have stopped midway, (and should have), but kept hoping something good would turn the book around. It didn't. The characters were people I could have cared less about."
1,arezee,"With many books in this genre, you think you know by page 20 where it's going. But the author's just sandbagging you. You're yanked around corners, pushed into plot pits from which there seems to be no escape. By the end of the read, you wonder ""how did we get here?"", and your page-20 certainty seems kind of silly.Not so with this book. By page 20 you know where it's going and you're right. This is not a rollercoaster ride, it's the kiddee train at the zoo.Also, in this age of computer spellchecks and word counts, you would think a careful author might want take a few seconds to determine if any word or phrase is seriously overworked in the manuscript. For example, the phrase ""of course."" See how many you can find."
1,The Ruins - SPOILERS,"This isn't the kind of story where the characters find themselves in an impossible situation but figure out ingenious ways to escape. Once the identity and properties of the mystery killer are revealed it's fairly obvious what's going to happen, and hopelessness runs through the tale-- things are bad, then worse, then worse still-- the killer is too smart, too lethal, too powerful for the (mostly unlikeable, immature, selfish, stupid) victims to overcome. I kept waiting for the problem-solving part of the story to kick in, but Smith bombards his characters with problems that cannot be solved-- threats from which they cannot possibly protect themselves-- and the inevitable carnage ensues."
5,The Ruins - Worth the wait,"This book is wonderful. The characters drawn so well that you have met these people through-out your life. The food you taste, the smells are pugnent. Mr. Smith, by his writing, puts you there with these people and it is a magnificent ride."
2,TOTALLY WEIRD!,"Ever hear of a vine with an attitude...and on steroids? Ever read a book with no chapters? Grab this book if that's what you'd like.Two couples (Jeff & Amy, Eric & Stacy) on vacation in Cancun meet up with Mathais and three Greek guys. When Mathais's brother runs off to a ruin in the jungle with his new love, Mathais wants to go get him, and the two couples and one of the Greeks (Pablo) join him for a day trip. They get several warnings not to proceed, but go ahead anyway and end up in a hellish nightmare.The author could have made the book 150-200 pages shorter and not lost anything. He goes to agonizing depths describing the physical and mental breakdown of each character. The movie made from his first book was good; let's hope this bomb doesn't make it to the silver screen."
2,"Appropriate Airport Page Turning Fare, nothing really new...","Typical of many books I've devoured while waiting for a plane, this one keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next, but there is no great connection with or feeling for the characters. This is a hamburger to Steven King's steak. While the subject matter is scary, the author lacks King's talent to really draw you in and ratchet up your nerves. Take it for what it is any you will be satisfied, but not mind blowing or surprising in any sense."
3,Too long-winded,"Although the author writes well, this book was incredibly long-winded and could have been better if it was tighter and much shorter, at least by a third to make it more suspenseful. Otherwise, a three-star rating."
3,"Fascinating Plot, Not very well handled.","I got The Ruins along withThe Human Effecton a 2 books discount offer. The Ruins is just too easily written for a book that should have been full of tension likeThe Beach, still a fairly gripping ride. Will be a great movie other than book!"
3,"Very Readable, but with a Large Caveat","Is this scary as hell? Yes.Is it also farfetched, laughable and downright silly? Yes.Is it a great book? No, but it's pretty darn good.This is one of those that not everyone will like. In fact, most people will probably love it or hate it.I think it's more in the middle. This is definitely one that you don't necessarily read for plot and definitely not for logic, but one that is amazing in terms of how well the suspense and its technique draws you in."
3,Decent summer read but I was expecting more...,"I thought this was a decent beach book but not much else. Scott Smith's earlier book ""A Simple Plan"" had me thinking and debating with fellow readers long after I put down the book - where did the characters go wrong? Which was the irrevocable decision? Where does bad judgment cross into evil? What would YOU do if you found that much money? In contrast, ""The Ruins"" is a straightforward and less complex horror tale - no moral decisions, just the Innocents vs. The Big Bad Terror. This book seemed a hybrid of the graphic blood and gore of Stephen King's ""Gerald's Game"" crossed with the who-will-survive tension of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"". Unlike some other reviewers, I found the character development thin and the characters stereotyped and unformed, but the suspense and pacing were strong points.After waiting eight (or is it ten) years for Scott Smith's follow-up to ""A Simple Plan"", this book was a moderately disappointing effort."
2,Made me feel physically ill for days afterward,"Though it kept me turning the pages, it was not an enjoyable book for me. By the time I was done, I felt like I had the stomach flu--nauseous and exhausted.The true horror of his story is not only the situations the characters find themselves in but the overwhelming feeling of hopelessness that pervades throughout the book. I couldn't help but think that the title of the book is aptly named. Even though there are no actual archeological ruins in the book, I felt like the actual ""ruins"" are the characters themselves.WARNING -- SPOILER FOLLOWS --They each die in a state of ruin--physically (from a variety of excruciating injuries), emotionally (from a breakdown of their own humanity), and spiritually (no sense of God or any kind of hope).If nihilism could be considered horror, then I guess this qualifies. Otherwise, 20% creepy, 80% stomach-turning and depressing."
3,Should be called THE VINES,"After you read this, you'll know why I think the title is misleading...but all I can say is: Very strange book. I read it in two sittings and couldn't put it down, but...it's not as good as A SIMPLE PLAN and could definitely have been a short story. I kept waiting for something different to happen, but it didn't. However, it was still gripping, and it gave me nightmares. All in all, a very unusual book. Will make a good horror film."
2,Disappointed after A Simple Plan,"Ordinarily, I might give this book about 3 stars. But I probably have to downgrade this because my expectations were so high after A Simple Plan, which I adored. Perhaps that's not fair. Certainly, this book is a page-turner - I had to keep reading it and reading it until I got to the end. But, unlike A Simple Plan, this went from a potential real-life situation to surreal horror - you really have to be able to suspend disbelief. To the point that it's just not credible. To me, that marred Smith's fantastic sense of story-telling. He really is a good writer, and he certainly did well with the subject matter he'd chosen. But I just couldn't buy the premise, and that somewhat ruined it for me. Sorry!"
1,LAME!,I have three words for you folks: THIS...BOOK...SUCKS. I think Stephen King was paid off to give such a poorly written piece of garbage such a glowing review. Save yourself sometime and skip this piece of poorly written and developed trash.
1,The Ruins,"When I started reading I got hooked because Scott Smith is a good writer. I thought his book A Simple Plan was just fantastic! However, The Ruins was incredibly dark, without hope, horribly gory, and I had a hard time reading it. If I hadn't spent so much money on the hardcover, I would have thrown it away. I stayed with it, too, because I continued to hope that these young kids would finally be rescued. This book is incredibly depressing. Toward the end it became obvious that no one believed in God and they were, indeed, truly alone, forever. Very, very dark and depressing. I will do my best to warn others not to read this book."
2,"Fun to read, but disappointing in general","This book starts great, but then things turn wrong. I would suggest it as a good read for its fiction writing in detailing the human feelings and emotions, even the story itself is not bad, but detailing it closer to the end is just too much.Spoilers here onward --> I mean a plant that can eat people is good fiction, but a plant that speak german and imitate smells of hamburger, then this is bad!!!!!"
1,Most Boring Book I've Ever Read,"It took over 500 pages to write basically what should have been a short story. It didn't need chapters, because it was just nonstop rewriting of the characters actions with each other. I went through 200 pages before even coming to the horror of the plant. He should have developed the plants horror, instead of going into how the characters constantly whine about each other. Where did the thing come from, why didn't they at least try fire to burn it, and couldn't they have flung some at the natives who kept them isolated to protect themselves. I gave it one star because there was nothing lower, and am throwing out the book, instead of keeping it as a paper weight. If writing this book is his only day job, I really recommend a career change. If you have trouble sleeping, read this; because after 10 pages you won't be able to stay awake. No wonder Sams Club was selling this for $4.75; they probably got them on a close out from the publisher."
5,A Wonderful Novel,I can't believe this novel is not uniformly getting five stars! It's brilliant -- totally riveting and great. I gave it to my boyfriend and a friend who also loved it.
1,I just lost hours of my life,"Having read A Simple Plan I thought I would give The Ruins a try. Sadly- I wish I hadn't. It's like a really bad horror movie you pick up at the store for 5$. Pretty good review by Stephen King- so it has to be decent right? No- it's not. I feel like I have wasted a few hours of my life on this book. It was so bad- yet I couldn't put it down. And, just having finished it- I am so much more dissapointed. The characters are weak, stupid and selfish. It was a battle of wits with one man holding up the other four, and as soon as he died- it was all over. Just to begin again 3 days later. And the vine- is never explained. Some sort of closure regarding the how and why the vine came to be would have been nice. Instead Mr. Smith thinks we'd enjoy it more if we only knew that it just traps 5 more people. Really, do not waste your time or money on this poorly written book. I'm already very sorry that I did (luckily though, I am only borrowing it from the library.)"
1,Who Cares?,"We waited 12 years (or whatever) for this? [SPOILER ALERT!] If you're thinking of reading this book, don't continue.Four kids hunting ruins in the Yucatan get trapped and eaten by a sentient vine. Smith writes well, but who cares? It was obvious that Smith's goal is a summer blockbuster film starring Julia Stiles and Natalie Portman. I suspect his goal will be achieved and, when I think about it, I guess I'd prefer to spend two hours watching Julia Stiles or Natalie Portman get eaten by a vine than spend three or four hours reading this ridiculous book. If you haven't read this book, but have read this far in this review: You have been warned."
2,A Serious Disappointment,"Internal musings, meant I guess to add characterization, weigh this story down. While the premise is intriguing, the story would had been better served as a novella. Yes, there are some wonderful images, but after ""A Simple Plan,"" I expected more -- much more. The movie is being released soon and will undoubtedly take liberties with the narrative, probably creating a more visceral experience. It took me weeks to get through this because I could easily put it down -- and clearly did. A lot. A thriller that fails to thrill until the final 60 pages doesn't make for much of a good read."
1,Too Silly & Contrived,"I bought this book because it was supposed to be a great summer thriller. What I got was a silly, contrived plot of dimwitted kids and man eating flowers. What a waste of time and money."
1,Overrated,"I cannot figure out the excitement about this book. The writing is average, and the plot is only slightly better."
2,A Disappointing Read,"A book with an interesting story line that does not develop characters or a cohesive explanation of the main plot. If you are interested in repetitive dialog, characters that never develop and gore...this could be your book."
1,A wasted afternoon,"This is one of the worst books I've read in a while, and I'm shocked that Stephen King liked it. My guess is that he is applauding the complete lack of competetion in the book. Any author who, like this one, starts with a great premise and adds adequate characterization (but not to the point that I cared about any of the characters) and then completely forgets to include a plot should be spanked in public. I kept waiting for the characters to try to figure out their situation, for something to actually happen, but nothing happened at all. The author presented various clues to the situation and then just let them lie there. If this story had been told around a fire in the depths of winter in a Norse village, the storyteller would have been killed and eaten."
1,This book is terrible!!!,"I have read many books in this genre and have never read one as boring and slow as this. The book never gets to the point (which is?). There is no story to the book, just rambling continuation of the same thing. Also there is hardly a climax and end to the story. If the movie is anything like this, it must be a bomb too!!"
3,A stacked deck,"Take an interesting premise, characters that are individuals who make decisions that are not outrageous. This should work, and you stay with it for a while.But this story is totally unsatisfactory. This plot is the equivilant of placing ants in a bucket and showing no mercy."
2,Little Shop of Horrors Redux,"I had high expectations but was ultimately disappointed by this read. Truly a page turner until the inane and improbable overtake the stark and suspenseful writing. Once the conflict is established, character development halts, the plot bogs down and the scenery never changes. Most limiting is the fact that the villain is a plant -- no matter how hard Smith tries to spruce it up with preposterous properties, it remains a plant. A better format for this tome may well have been a Choose Your Own Adventure Book."
2,"""Ruined"" by the ending","""The Ruins"" is a great ride, but the ending is so disappointing that the book was very much of a let-down. I kept waiting for the twist that would never come - even when there were only 11 pages left I kept up hope. Maybe on the second time around (e.g. the movie version) a more creative ending will be written."
3,An easy read,A friend loaned me this book and we usually enjoy the same type of read. It was OK but certainly no lofty tome. If you are looking for an interesting easy read go for it. It isn't really scary but I no longer look at our creeping vine the same way.
3,Plants rule!,"I was anxious to read this. It had been billed as one of thescariest books to come around. A book has never frightened me,so I was intrigued. This author's first book, ""A Simple Plan"",had been a good read, not scary but good. Well, I'm afraid ""TheRuins"" didn't make the grade. It's predictable. Frankly, I beganskipping through it midway through. I hear a movie might be madefrom it. Maybe it will be worth an investment of a couple ofhours. But not the book."
5,gripping,The story reminded me in a lot of ways of Stephen King. A good book thatyou really get involved in quickly and have to finish regardless ofwhatever else is waiting to be done at the time.
2,The Ruins follows simplistic plan,"Ensnarled by the hype I had expected a good page-turner scare with Scott Smith's The Ruins; I was resoundly disappointed. This novel is highly formulaic, its characters dull and predictable and once the potency of the threat is revealed there is little suspense nor surprises for the reader. It read like an okay hot summer afternoon, with rain, at the $4.25 matinee."
3,A flaw in the plot..,"I find this obvious flaw in the plot.Why the plant does not spread to the outside world through natural elements like rain and wind (of which there is plenty in the story itself)? Why parts of the vine (a twig, spores, flowers/ petals, leaf)cannot be washed down into the jungle outside, why it cannot be carried in the wind to the outside jungle? Even the settling rainwater can carry micro-sized parts of the plant to the terrain outside..isn't it?The 'ruins' is not hermetically sealed, is it? Then how can there be isolation of the plant on the Ruins? The whole plot collapses if this cannot be explained, doesn't it?"
2,The good: refreshingly simple plot. The bad: unsurprising and dull.,"I believe that I have permanently burned myself out on horror. The Ruins came highly recommended-- author is supposed to be good, the book itself is supposed to be smart. One of the best entries in the field at the moment, supposedly.But, sad to say, I really wasn't impressed. Although there is something to be said for the kind of pleasantly retro simplicity of the plot, that's nearly the biggest praise that I can muster. In general, I found the characters irritating and the plot predictable. And while the simplicity *was* nice, it simply did not carry 509 pages. By the end, I was seriously bored.But the biggest crime? Once I understood the set up, not one single thing surprised me about the book. A death sentence, really.I would give this one a miss. Anyone got any recommendations for horror out there which I would actually like, or should I give up on the genre completely?"
2,Torture Porn,"The plot--and the deficiencies therein--of The Ruins, by Scott Smith, have been recounted by other reviews effectively, so I'll try not to be redundant.The good--Smith is a quick read, and, for a story that doesn't move much from a single location, that's an accomplishment.What I have to add to the bad--first, a strange choice for a title. The story barely has anything to do with ruins.Second, The Ruins is bascially yet another installment with the horror genre's recent infatuation with torture porn. Don't worry, gentle reader, The Ruins is softcore when it comes down to it, but the concept is really the same: isolate some young people and make horrible things happen to them.Third, the epilogue of the book, which is supposed to leave us with a creepy feeling as we put it down is so wildly implausible it just didn't work for me.Average work, at best."
2,Not worth time/money,"I was way not impressed by this book. Felt like I needed to rate it appropriately. Many of the one star/two star reviewers hit on the points not great in this book. While the story line not great, I was very surprised by how NOT developed the characters were. I couldn't keep the two couples straight at all, it was as if they were all the same...If I were you, I wouldn't spend time/money on this book. Wish I had read the reviews before I read the book!"
3,"A step down from ""A Simple Plan""","Having read this book, (after watching the movie on cable) I was hoping that the book would expand and/or answer some questions that the movie left. But the book and the movie seems to be almost mirror images of each other. The movie answers some questions left in the forum posts but leaves the origin of the vines in the dark! (check out the forum reviews for a expanded discussion about this and my views on it). I just wish when Scott wrote this book he kept the writing style of ""a simple plan"". THAT book at least answers a lot of questions (in the story)that ""The Ruins"" leaves open and making the viewer and reader scratching their heads over.IF you had to make a choice between buying 'The Ruins' or 'A simple plan' I would recommend buying 'a simple plan' mostly for a well thought out and semi-fast paced story vs a slow prodding one that leaves a lot of questions that arent answered!"
1,Im Sorry I read it,Im sad that I can never have back the time I wasted reading this book. This was probably the worst book I have read in several years. The characters all were unrealistic. People do not behave in such a way. I kept reading thinking that something cool would happen and everything would make sense or that the characters would smarten up and be intresting but it was all downhill after the fitst couple chapters.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"This is one of those books I wish I'd stopped reading about halfway through. It's boring. It's predictable. The four American characters are indistinguishable from each other. A half-hearted attempt is made to imply that one of the group that sets forth for the ruins might not be all that they seem, but it never goes anywhere. And the writing itself is paltry. Very little description of the world which resulted in my never crossing that boundary where you start to live out the events happening in the book. It was always just words on a page. Plants are green and red. A hat is blue. Someone has curly brown hair. It's pretty plain. But my biggest complaint is that Smith TELLS us everything. Very little is SHOWN. The end effect is like listening to a very long-winded acquaintance tell you about the bad vacation of someone they know. ""The Ruins"" gets my vote for the most overrated book of 2006."
3,Not very good but I can't put it down. A guilty pleasure,"I watched the movie twice, I like it enough to watch it with my friends one more time. In a boring afternoon, I browsed the book. Wow, I can not put it down -- the book was more complicated than the movie, but not by much; some plot and characters were changed for the movie, they were good one way, or another.The book was flawed for sure, but the writing was so skillful -- I can't help to recommend it as a guilty pleasure reading."
2,"If you have a few hours to waste, go ahead.","How about a book that grabs you through the first half and then provides jaw-breaking yawns to the very end? There is enough plot summary by other readers to give you the 411. I'll just add that it was a total waste of time. I should have taken a nap or cleaned out the fridge; either one would have amounted to something, whereas reading this book dulled my senses and robbed me of $4.88 (bought it at Sam's....)."
2,dull,"Perhaps the movie will prove a winner because the book cannot remotely claim the title. The work is often dull and barely kept my interest. None of the characters felt genuine or likeable in any sense, and I was left not caring what happened to the lot. From the ads on television, the film seems more of a horror flick than anything else, and the exclusion of much of the tedium in the novel might save it from a similar fate."
4,Not bad at all,"I bought this book during a recent road trip. My expectations were not high. As a writer Mr. Smith lacks polish, or any sense of subtlety. This may be because he is writing for a mass audience. Therefore, there is no time to get into any psychological complexities. The characters are merely plot devices. Having said that, this author succeded in doing the one thing all great authors do - force you to look at yourself. I kept thinking, what would I do in a similar situation? How would I react? The atmosphere is set up so effectively, even if the premise is both unnecessary and ridiculous, that the tug between fighting to survive and just quitting never lets you go. That puts this book far above your average mass market paperback. Come to it with an open mind, a willingness to suspend disbelief, and a willingness to look at yourself, and you will find it an enjoyable read."
1,"Disappointing, Sucks...Need I Say More","Horrible, sucked my will to live..........if the possessed plants did not get me first. Long, boring huge parts missing. Stephen King gave this book high regard he must have been on crack when he read it."
1,overhyped waste of time and money,"First, let me say that I almost never leave reviews of books on this site. But, I feel so strongly about this book that I felt compelled to write a review. I had high hopes for this book. We were going on a trip and I bought the audio version--VERY predictable, VERY boring...after a while you really don't care whether the main characters die or not. This book needed a really good editor before it went to press. Even my teenagers who LOVE horror/thriller books and movies wanted me to fast forward through large sections of this book. Really a waste of money and time. VERY DISAPPOINTING!! Hard to believe that anyone thought this was a good read."
4,EXCELLENT READ; SCARY,"This book was an exciting surprise. College kids on vacation enter into ""The Twilight Zone"". Actions of the Natives are puzzeling at best and forboding. Without giving the clincher away; an evil so base but yet intelligent, war with these people in a fight for survial."
3,"Couldn't put it down, but still disenchanted","As a loyal Stephen King fan, I can't see why he promotes this book so much. True, it's horrifying as a concept. And the story was addictive- I really got sucked in pretty quickly and read the book in about 3 days obsessively. And yet, I think I was hoping the conclusion and the long path leading to it would end up differently than what seemed obvious from very early in the story- I was hoping to be surprised, and I wasn't. Yes, the vine's capabilities were a bit 'unique', in a BIG suspend-your-disbelief kind of way. But the outcome was very predictable, disappointingly so. Also, like other reviews say, the characters are a bit generic. Although, I have to give credit where it's due. I finished this book days ago, and am still thinking about the story. So, it must have done something right. Concluding sentiment: it left a bad taste in my mouth."
2,A short story extended into a novel,This would have made a good short story but as written was waaay too long. I lost interest quickly and I tend to love stories like this. Part of my problem was that I did not care for any of the characters so could care less what happened to them. I actually found myself rooting for the plants. I would not waste my time on this book.
1,A Total Waste of a Read,"Are you kidding me? It's as if Scott Smith never read a horror book in his life and thought he was creating a genre. I've read ""Goosebumps"" that were more entertaining. The book is about survival, or rather dying, all of which is done in a cliched and repetitive way. There is no suspense, you know what is going to happen from page 50. It is the lamest ""evil"" since the plant in ""Little Shop of Horrors.""Stephen King's review influenced me to buy it and I feel betrayed by an author I used to truly enjoy. However, after aliens came out of people's bums in ""Dreamcatcher"" it shouldn't surprise me that ""The Ruins"" is a book King would recommend."
2,The Terror of Tedium,"What Ruins? The only thing related to ruins was my ruined 3 days of trying to slog through this tedious, bloated story. It would have been better as a novella or a very short, short story. The title is a non-event. The story is 200+ pages too long. The only terror was tedium. In all my years I have only stopped reading a handful of books, giving them 1 stars. I forced myself to complete this book hence the 2 star rating. There is no terror. It is not scary. It is superficial at best and does not develop any kind of plot-line. Both my wife and I found ourselves skimming many pages as they were just too painful to read.All in all not a recommend. Save your money. Sad since Mr. Smith's first novel was terrific, ""A Simple Plan"". If you want to read something along this thesis try Mr. James Rollins."
3,Average Hollywood storyline...,"Note: I have not seen the movie.The first thing that's obvious about Scott Smith is that he is writing almost as if this story was made for the big screen. It is written in a style similar to a screenplay. While stories like these are intriguing in it's human component, you don't actually learn anything about the protagonist, that's probably where the story could've been more interesting. I picked this up since it had sort of a cryptozoology theme (can't say more without giving it away). But the story was not so much about that as it was more of a horror/thriller type book. If you want to explore more interesting cryptozoology themes I would recommend Amazonia by James Rollins."
4,I'll remember this one,"This isn't a perfect horror story, but it is quite good. I think my biggest problem with it is that I felt more sympathy for the peripheral characters (Pablo, Mathias) than I did for the American protagonists, and I wonder if that's intentional on the part of the author. I'm also a little bothered that locals didn't make more effort to keep people away from the jungle site. Anyway, it's a good, creepy read that you'll remember for quite a long time."
5,Do Not Read This Book Alone!,"This is, without qualification, the MOST FRIGHTENING book I have ever read! One of my cats jumped onto my bed while I was reading it and I nearly had a myocardial infarction! Holy Cow! The plot literally sneaks up on you. Like the wonderful old ""B"" movies. Starting slow and quiet, the pieces of the puzzle begin to form, then coalesce, and when it all comes together and you realize what's happening, and it all just blew me away. If you love being scared out of your wits and a good story to boot, read this book. It has an interesting moral: Be very slow to discount the beliefs of people just because they may seem ""less than"" your society, your education level, your standards. How smart you may be in this world depends upon where you are standing at the time of assessment.I would give this all the stars in the world, and it wouldn't be enough. Suffice it to say, this will scare you out of your complacency, and probably everything else, too. At least in my humble opinion!"
1,A Literary Root Canal,"The horror of this book is that you feel compelled to keep reading, thinking: the unsympathetic characters will develop more fully; the navel-gazing will turn to thoughtful action; the source and intelligence behind the scheming carnivore plant (which is smarter and more resourceful than any of the wretched humans) and abandoned mine site will be revealed; and some glimmer of hope will surface for these witless morons.Disappointment is your reward.We listened to the audio version while on a long vacation road trip. It was a chore, but we expected some pay off when we got to the 12th and final CD. Finishing it off was a relief."
4,Lost sleep over it,"I was in to this book the second I started reading. The characters were so well defined I felt like I could reach out and touch them. It was like I was literally in the book living the horror myself. I was sad to see it end, but at the same time felt a sense of relief that I could finally breathe again. Great book."
3,Poor representation of the Greek tourist,"My biggest disappointment though was the author's portrayal of the Greek tourist, as unthinking folks who would do nothing to stop such poor vacation planning. The Greeks are some of the most organized and savvy people on this earth. Many times in my travels in Greece and Macedonia I have had Greek peasants ready to give me the Fodors out of their suitcases in order to help find this or that good deal on a B&B. On my last trip I ran out of gas in a remote part of the Acropolis. After a time a pita truck came down the highway. The driver, a middle aged Greek man, stopped and siphoned gas from his truck into my car, (getting a mouthful of petrol in the process). He would not take a traveller's check for his trouble no matter how much I begged. If your looking for a thriller that is respectful of the Greek culture (both past and present) I highly recommend ""Zorba the Greek."""
3,How to become really depressed,"I really enjoyed reading the book as the author keeps the reader on the edge. However, as the book begins the conclusion of the story, the reader realizes that the situation will continue after the primary characters are caught in a trap they cannot escape. For me, I prefer a more positive conclusion. I read for information and enjoyment, but the book, while I enjoyed the journey to a point, disappointed me in the end."
2,This book hurt me at times. It really hurt.,"When the author stayed on topic, it was actually a fun read. But there is so so so much filler in place to stretch this out to a novel. Another bad thing is that many of the author's thoughts are predictable. And at times just in bad taste. This is my first Scott Smith novel and will be my last.Now, had the story been written as a short story or something like that, I think it would have been much better. It just seemed to me that the effort it took to make a novel just ruined the story."
3,Not as great as I thought it would be....,"After reading Stephen King's review, I thought this book would be the best summer read since Jaws. Was anyone else slightly disappointed in the book? Yes it was engrossing - I read it in almost one sitting - but it's so dark and depressing - the synopsis has already been told - 5 visitors in Cancun go off to find a missing brother in the Mayan jungle. They end up in a really strange place where they have no control over what is happening to them.That's all that I'm going to say because to say more would really ruin the story for those of you who haven't read it.However, I felt that Scott Smith should have had even a little bit of historical or factual information in the novel so that you knew who the Mayans were - this actually could have taken place anywhere in any jungle - not just Mexico.I did like the book - I just didn't love it and I really wanted to."
1,Waste of time,"I can't believe this is the same guy who wrote ""A Simple Plan"". I loved that book but I can't believe Smith spent all the years in the interim writing this tripe. Save your money."
1,Of course King liked it...he wrote It!!..30 years ago!,"Of course Stephen King gave it a good review.....he wrote the freging concept himself. I too was drawn to all the hype this title garnered, it was suppose to be one of the best selling horror novels, it was suppose to be the next generation in great scare novels, what it turned out to be was a whole lot of nothing!... I made myself read the whole book just knowing it was going to get better, just around the next page it was going to start really rocking....nope, stayed boring the whole dang way. Oh, and not to be a party pooper but, if you have read Creepshow or seen the movie....you know that one where the teenagers are stuck on the platform in the lake cause something around them was picking them off one at a time?......then you already know this book."
1,repetitive and boring,"This author goes on for chapters about the most mundane things, and nothing ever happens. He repeats things incessantly. The story line provided great potential for many scenarios, but the author belabors the same things over & over. He is not an accomplished writer."
1,Boring!,This book was a waste of my time and money. Absolutely a worthless read. Poor writing and a poor excuse for a book.
1,DO NOT READ THIS,"Ok, I wish I could use sure profanity here because this book is so bad that it should be required. Yes it is crafted fairly well until you start seeing thru the BS that has grabbed your attention causing you to not noticed the holes. This book is a sick joke. It has no purpose. I wanted to get thru the end, thought about reading the last page but did not. I wish I had. Instead I skipped sentences, paragraphs allowing just word patterns to guide me past the thinly veiled sim plicate of plot. What a waste of time and anxiety. Read the last page if you feel compelled to read this piece of crap cuz it sucks."
3,Scott Smith's Jungle Book,"While the premise of this book seems simple and straight forward;there is a sinister undertone from the beginning.Language barriers,young people who have no sense of their own mortality and nature exhausted by our abuse.This book has it all! I was reminded of the kudzu that was brought to this country to stop erosion and it has literally taken over in certain areas of the south. At our bookclub,it was posited that the vine was representative of infectious diseases.I enjoyed the book.It was not a challenging read and it probably won't be nominated for the Pulitzer but worth your time.It makes one think which,after all ,is the purpose of any book."
1,Great reviews - disappointing book,"Picked it up at an airport store for some easy reading. The book cover had a lot of very positive reviews. Yet as the book progressed I found myself skipping more and more, until finally - something I dont think I've ever done before, I actually skipped to the end. It's 500 tedious pages,a drawn-out story about a vine that kills people. Don't even bother."
1,Yawn,"Sadly, this book is NOT very good. Just goes to prove that either Hollywood is not really looking for quality or that Stephen King's influence can get anything made into a movie."
1,rwobrien says no.,"Probably the worst novel I have read in 25 years. Dont waste your money. Usually I place my hardcover purchases in my library, loan out to my friends or donate to the public library. This one I threw in the garbage."
1,A waste of time and money and paper,"All I can do is add to the negative reviews below, most of which have pre-summarized what I might have said. I liked ""A Simple Plan"" (even though it is depressing, and the movie was awful), so I thought I'd give this book a chance. But it is really, really bad. The story was dumb, the characters were badly developed, I cared not a jot for what happened to them, and the whole thing could have been summed up in about 500 not-very-interesting words. I read it to the end, but found myself skimming pages - I think I covered the last 100 pages or so in about ten minutes, and saved myself a lot of wasted time. A summary of this book: some vines kill a bunch of people. Whatever."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The characters were one dimensional and, at times, down right stupid. When I read a thriller I expect to be scared or at least a little nervous and anxious. This novel does not deliver any of that."
2,"figures King would like it, it's unresolved like his own stories","This book was an intriguing but slow slog through the jungle. The characters were not especially interesting or likeable, and while the situation they were in was compelling, there was no psychological payoff or resolution. Like some Stephen King stories, there was no wrap-up or explanation given for all that had transpired- like the story itself was so great and absorbing that you wouldn't care. But I did care, and closed this book thinking, ""I read all this for what?"""
2,Agonizing read.,"The book caught my attention waiting at the airport. I've read better books. The characters just made me want to vomit, no depth. The story has gaps in several areas and the end was not suprising to me. The idea of the book would make a good hollywood movie, that's it. Blah..borrow it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This book seemed like it couldn't be put down. I have to give credit to Mr. Smith, he did force me to read this piece of junk all the way through hoping something would happen or some plotline would be explained. After reading this ""horror"" book, I feel less than satisfied. The plot was the dumbest idea ever and there were way too many leaps of faith. I want my Sunday back. Do not waste your time with this book."
3,Looking at my plants closer!,"Are my plants looking at me? I didn't think this book would spook me but it did. I loved the pace...the narrative moved slow, from different perspectives, and ended differently that I expected. This was a quick read, enough spookiness to wake me up but not so scary I was afraid to walk through the dark house. I just had to know what was going to happen next. At times some of the narration felt 'clunky' but for the most part it was an enjoyable read."
2,Not a fan....,"I've read so many great reviews about this book that I couldn't wait to dive into it...but after the first 100 pages, the story line failed to engage me,"
1,A miserable read!!,"When I pick up any genre of fiction book, the bottom line is that I want to be entertained. The author writes so well,yet I had to put the book down from sheer misery. If I want total hopelessness and abject misery, I can just turn on the news!!J.S"
1,Don't Bother,"There is nothing to compare this waste of time with. It lacks everything except it does entice you for awhile. How can this ""acclaimed"" author make up a killer vine without explanation at least at the end and then expect us to believe any of it. What was the point? Did Stephan King really read this book? I read a Simple Plan, but this defies the comparison. YUUK"
5,Great gruesome survival,"Such a simple story turns into a great book...no spoilers here, just a few comments. I read A Simple Plan, which, plot wise, is brain surgery to what is going on here, but I think that Smith pulls this type of story off better, it just kind of boils until it boils over...very effective use of character management, he treats all the characters equally, which keeps you guessing as to the inevitable fate of each. I can only hope it will not be 10+ years until his next book."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad.","Quite possibly the worst book ever.Not interesting, Not scary, and certainly not worth anyones time."
1,Stephen King Endorsed This?,"This is a 30 page short story painfully extended into over 300 pages. I generally enjoy Stephen King's work - his endorsement was the reason I purchased The Ruins. The plot is beyond weak. Two young couples meet a group of Greeks and a German on a vacation in Mexico. Despite speaking neither language, they agree to follow them to a Mayan ruin. I won't ""ruin"" the storyline for those who wish to indulge but the ""monster"" they encounter is never explained. The ruins caretakers, when first introduced, are malnourished and despondent. Without explanation they suddenly become an organized tribe of fierce, healthy warriors. Go figure. Character development is endless pages describing what it feels like to stick a knife in your own leg. Regardless, I would've rolled with it if the plot had any redeeming qualities. Now I just feel like a sucker for buying the book. After a decade hiatus and an endorsement from King, I expect better. I guess Mr. Smith needed the money."
1,Bad novel! Bad novel! Stay Away!,"I was under the assumption that the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest limited its entries to one paragraph or so. If they have changed the rules, this book will win going away..."
1,This is not a Simple Plan,"I was truly dissapointed with this book. A Simple Plan is practically a masterpiece and Scott Smith comes up with a real disspointment. It is just not scary I am sorry, and it just becomes a truly repetitive and boring read. I thought this was written more for the sale of the film rights (its already happen), than as a truly horror book a la Stephen King. Better luck next time for Scott Smith, and you will not regret skipping this one. Erik S."
2,The Longest Short Story Ever Told,"In short, this book is a bummer. Scott Smith is a talented writer. I recommend his 'A Simple Plan' which details the downward spiral of a seemingly normal guy into a possibly deranged murderer. Its a great read with some surprising twists. But this book is another matter entirely. Although well written, it is essentially a 500 page Edgar Allen Poe short story. It locks onto you like python and never let's go. And that is the main problem. It is relentlessly negative without any real surprises after the first fifty pages. Anybody who has seen a few Tales From the Crypt episodes already knows where this story is going. The only thing missing is the closing screech of the Crypt Keeper.If you love doom, gore and depressing stories, help yourself. Me, I wish I had never picked it up."
4,The Ruins -- a simple review...,"Definately worth the read. Not as 'scary' as I hoped based on numerous quotes and reviews I read.The Ruins takes place in Mexico; an unlikely group of friends/tourists/strangers travel off the resort to assist a tourist find his brother (who left with a beautiful stranger, archaeologist). This group of friends follow a map to the excavation site, find the ruins, and become trapped there by the Mayans. The Ruins are controlled... by mysterious vines.Where I was not scared to the heights of sleepless nights, I did catch myself waking up scratching my arms and legs for ""no apparent reason"".A good, quick, creepy read!"
1,I was SO disappointed!,"""A Simple Plan"" was one of the most entertaining reads of my life, then Scott Smith went for YEARS without writing a second book. As soon as I heard about ""The Ruins,"" I dropped everything else to read it. I only finished reading it because I had waited so long, and because I kept thinking something good (or at least entertaining) had to come out of it. But I have to say, I can only recommend that you NEVER read this horribly depressing story devoid of entertainment value. I think Scott Smith must have waited too long, was probably under a lot of pressure to repeat his wildly successful first novel, and just couldn't come up with another good story."
4,Have an Open Mind and Enjoy,"I really enjoyed the book and think it was so well written that it seemed plausible to me. I have travelled all over Mexico, Central and South America and I have been in some places that reminded me of the jungle setting of the Ruins. I have also seen enough nave tourists get themselves into some horrible situations. I really can imagine something like this happening off the beaten path. There are so many places that exist that we never really hear about in the United States. If you like horror, have an open mind and a good imagination, I think you will enjoy this book."
1,Awful,I have to agree with the other one-star raters.-Horrible character development-Not frightening-Way too long.Where was the editor for this book? How many times did we have to have a particular scene told from the perspective of each of the characters? Agh! This story should have been no longer than 100 pages.I can't believe Stephen King gave this book a favorable review...he must have been temporarily insane.
4,Relentless and Unflagging,"If you're looking for comic relief you're reading about the wrong book. The Ruins is an unrelenting and unflinching story that doesn't even attempt to give its readers even a one-page break from the horror that's been mounting since around page 30. Once Smith's cast of characters reach the ruins, there is no stopping. You see the bad side of the characters as they seek to come to terms with the truth about the ruins. Whether this involves cannibalism, self-mutilation, or just plain stupidity you are treated to it.I enjoyed this book, but it won't be for everyone. It's the kind of thing Stephen King might have written if he were able to not 'be Stephen King.'"
1,Just Awful,This is truly mindless garbage. I feel swindled by whatever review I read.It feels like it was written by a teenager. Seriously. By a child.Just awful.
1,predictable and gross,I forced myself to read the entire gross mess in the hope there would be something worth while in there. Save yourself the trouble unles you enjoy slasher movies and that ilk.
1,Venus flytraps finally have a mentor,The paper thin characters in this book had me rooting for the vine - it just needed to eat more quickly to render this as a short story instead of a 300+ page book.
1,Please don't waste your time.,"There were so many moments I thought something interesting might actually happen ... yet it never did. This story managed to be both disturbing and boring at the same time. And if you happen to be even remotely science-minded, it will be VERY difficult for you to suspend your disbelief concerning some of the ""biology"". Please don't waste your time and money."
3,Review of the Ruins,"I thought that the book started out strong but then got slower. While I enjoyed reading it, I do not think that it is on par with other writers of horror/suspence novels."
1,The worst novel I've read in a long time!,"This book was horrifying in many ways: Horrifyingly dull and tedious, horrifyingly long, and horrifyingly predictable. I'm sorry I wasted the better part of 2 days reading this sad and trite little story. This is not a thriller as the cover may lead you to believe... It's just a gory, simply-plotted horror story, with no redeeming value whatsoever. I found the ""monster"" to be overdone and unbeleivable. Don't waste your time. Jim in Denver"
1,What happened?,"Loved his first book, despised this one. A complete waste of time. A page-turner - but turning pages only to be disappointed time and again. Poor character development plus a non-plot equals a rotten ending. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS BOOK.I am sorry, Mr. Smith, as I wanted to love your book. Your assumption that people the age of those in your book are complete idiots is really very irritating. Good luck if you decide to try again."
1,predictable and not scary at all,"I think Stephen King liked this book because its basically a re-hash of many of his favorite themes. I could not muster much sympathy for the characters and I guessed the true ""monster"" very quickly in the story."
