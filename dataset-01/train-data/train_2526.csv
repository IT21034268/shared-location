4,Incredible imagination!,"Great stuff by Clive Barker. His vision (and that is the only appropriate word for it) of the Imajica is brilliant and detailed. However, less experienced readers might get a little bogged down at the start. There are parts where the storyline slows down, but once Gentle discovers who he really is, the story really takes off. Gentle's blocking of his own pneuma is the best scene in the book (I had to grab my trusty collins dictionary to find out what the hell a pneuma is). However, Barker's sex scenes are just a little sick for my tastes."
3,"morbidly fascinating, but too many plot holes","This is honestly one of the most bizarre books I have ever read.It's gripping, no doubt about that. You put it down and find your mind wandering back to the strange lands of the Five Dominions, wondering what will happen next. The strange events, places, and people stick in your mind and invade your thoughts.While the premise for the book is good, it could have been written better. Too many things are left unexplained, and near the end of the book the characters start acting very out-of-character. Mr. Barker also throws in some pretty graphic and disgusting scenes, seemingly just to shock the reader into going, ""Ewwww, gross!""I enjoyed reading the book once, but I don't think I'll be opening its pages again. In addition to leaving many things unanswered, it could have been about 200-300 pages shorter. But even though I'll never read Imajica again, I think that parts of it will continue to haunt my subconscious for a long time to come..."
2,Great imagination with nothing to do with it.,"Let me start by saying that this book is not for everyone. Now that might sound obvious, but its true. It has a very otherwordly feel to it and Barker paints a picture of the five dominions very well. Yet, he doesnt do much with them. Its like having a photo album buried in the ground. The pictures might be good, but they are still in the ground doing nothing. He makes this unique world and people, but it seems to me they all meander around aimlessly without a clear purpose. Ok, they going to reconcile the dominions or are they? It seems to be longwinded for the sake of it. The plot seems to introduce new things all the time that just come and go. Nothing wrong with the writing, just a little boring. I like the Damnation game way more"
3,Imaganitive,"Imajica certainly is an interesting book from a story point of view - and would probably make a good movie. I found it interesting and Barker certainly has a creative mind for fantasy. I would recommend this book to someone who wants to read a straightfwd story. I gave it 3 stars because it was 1)a little simplistic in terms of the characters, 2)graphic sex passages which seemed totally out of place (compareed to the rest of the book). Thank you."
5,de-lish-us,"I started getting this sausage from a friend of mine years ago for my birthday and Christmas just about every year. Lately, I have found it at Asian/Chinese markets. It is awesome sliced up and steamed with white rice. Yum!Dif brand it looks like, though."
2,Be very cautious before buying,"The name is a misnomer. The title, had it been correctly descriptive of the content, should have included such qualifications as ""highly selective, extensively abridged, and subjectively chosen points of historical interest."" On top of these limitations, I found the price to be quite unreasonable. I must admit that I did not read the book more than just skimming its list of contents and a cursery turning of the pages. Realizing that it was not what the title implied and that it did not seem worth the price, I returned it."
3,"Great Basics, Bad Rushed Ending","the first several chapters are good if you are a beginner as I consider myself. However, I wanted to learn some techniques not covered. The last chapters seemed rushed and most of the c# examples do not work with Visual Studio 2008. The Infopath application examples worked fine on InfoPath 2007, just anything with Visual Studio code samples did not work on Visual Studion 2008. There may have been some drastic changes between VS 2003 to VS 2005 to VS 2008. I also noticed more errata towards the end of the book with words appearing multiple times and misplaced words more noticable in the last 3 chapters."
5,incredible stuff,"chavez is one of the most inventive rock groups alive. i was blown away by the originality, beauty and force of the songs on this album. they don't sound like any other band, they know how to play their instruments and they write great songs. it's very refreshing to hear music that rocks so hard without any pretense or self-importance. if you like interesting and unconventional music, buy this."
4,2nd installment,"Though not as tightly wound as their first record, ""Gone Glimmering,"" Chavez still manage to captivate once again with ""Ride The Fader."" Clay Tarver and Matt Sweeney's signature dissonant riffs and block-rocking beats (courtesy James Lo and Scott Marshall) suffuse this record, and it's all bigger, better, and louder than before. Standouts include ""Unreal Is Here,"" ""Tight Around The Jaws,"" and the bombastic ""You Must Be Stopped."""
3,good but better ones out there,"i just purchase this sketch book and im not fully satisfied with it, it only has 24 sheets which is disappointing, and the pages are cream colored not white but the size is good and binding seems feeble. the only reason i bought this one was bc i purchase a sketch like the pic for this item before and the book i received is not the same one ."
5,This Bedside Commode is of good quality,"I purchased this chair commode for an elderly lady. It is made well. It looks good, and it is easy to use and clean"
5,An amazingly great buy!,"I needed this commode for my elderly mother. I was amazed by the quality, because of the low price, compared to other similar commodes, which cost over a hundred dollars! In addition, the shipping was free. It arrived very quickly, was well packaged and easy to assemble. If we need similar products for her, this will be the company I plan to deal with. Thanks."
2,Not what we expected,"Too heavy. The toilet seat cover is flimsy, not big/ wide enough, and just plain uncomfortable to sit on. Feels as if you are sitting on the bar underneath. The image provided on Amazon is not what it looks when assembled. Additionally, the box was partially opened when delivered. If we had bought it locally, I would return it."
4,toliet,seems to be good. not as wide as I had hoped but bought it for my husband who broke a leg but he didnt use it because it wasnt wide enough/ i decided to keep it because its a good thing to have on hand in case of emergencies or camping..
5,home needs,My bathroom is very small so this was just perfect. It easy to use and I like that you can adjust it to the right height. thank you
5,"Great product at a great price, unbeatable value","The product is a great value, very sturdy and easy to set up. It is also easily movable and not bulky. Very happy with it."
3,Kind of small,"This arrived promptly and and in good condition. It is strong enough and the width is fine, but the front to back depth is rather small. I would not recommend this for a large person. The legs are adjustable so the height is no problem."
5,Look no further,"This is the best possible commode for the money. It's big enough, I weigh around 260, it's sturdy enough, and comes all put together in the box. Truly, you don't have to shop any further. This is the one. The price is fantastically inexpensive for what the product is."
5,Good Product,Bought this for my 95 year old mother to give he handles when she gets up from the toilet. adjustable legs make it easy to make it work for her to not have to work so hard to stand
5,Bedside commode,I purchase this when my mom got sick and she has loved it ever since.It is beside her bed in case she feels she can't make it to the bathroom at night.In the morning it is washed and it does not keep any smells
5,great value for the price,"What do you say, it works as expected and we are very happy with our purchas. A great value for the price."
3,Good not great,"The frame is easy to adjust, comes assembled. The seat is not a real sturdy seat so I would use caution for heavier persons. Easy to assemble, arrived in great condition when expected."
5,Girltalk from someone who really knows,"I first read Girltalk in middle school and I remember how reassuring so much of Weston's advice was on issues such as body image and relating to boys, and how informative the sections were on how to deal with long-distance friendships or the first whispers floating around school about alcohol and drugs. Now a sophomore in college, I recently paged through the book and was struck by how true (and, in fact, relevant) the advice still was. Girltalk mixes real letters from readers and answers to them, with Weston's own memories, research, and comforting advice, all of which makes this book ideal for girls of all ages."
3,Kind of like...,...trying to navigate a Piper Cub through the heart of an oatmeal-storm. LAPSED is nowhere near as compelling as its predecessor (AMANITA). I found most of it I too dense to get through. Hope the new one (August '99) is more listenable.
4,Ella - A Complex Woman in Complex Times,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it well researched. Ella was a complex woman living in complex times, and her strange and cold husband, combined with her sister Alexandra'a increasing madness and dependency upon Rasputin, proved to be two huge crosses of the many she bore in her life. I wonder how different things might have been had Ella not been murdered as so many of the Romanovs were. Ella's story is good follow-up to Nicholas and Alexandra. The Massey book started me on my Imperialist Russia kick, which still continues, and I am continually fascinated with this family, whose members included so many tragic figures, some mad, some stupid, others noble, and others trying to be. I believe Ella wanted to be a saint and she actually got her wish. She has been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. I found it satisfying reading and believe it will lead the reader to other Romanov biographies."
1,"stilted, lifeless biography","A formal and very correct study, this biography has little new info about anything. An all-around poorly done job."
2,VERY Disappointing,"I've been reading about the intertwinings of 19th century royals for a long time, and was really happy to get this book, since it's about a woman who has been dealt with only peripherally in other books about her famous relatives.I'm in total agreement that it should have been SO much better. As far as I'm concerned, the only good thing about it was the photographs, most of which I'd not seen before.Sloppily edited (translated?) and poorly written."
4,"A ""good-enough"" biography.","I hvae long been fascinated with the Romanov dynasty, and looked forward to reading this biography of the saintly Ella. I felt, after finishing the book, that her status as a saint of the Russian Orthodox church is well-established and well-deserved. I greatly appreciated the insights into her difficult relationship with her husband Serge, and her devotion to good works after his murder. Still, I left this biography with less of a sense of Ella as a ""fleshed-out"" human being as I might have, given the length of the text, which is why I have given the book four stars. Still, an engaging read and a good addition to my extensive library about the Romanovs and their contemporaries."
4,The starting point for your research into the Saqqara area,"This book is part of a series, dedicated to listing the bibliographical references of texts found throughout Egypt. It sorts the texts in topographical order, with indexes on names of kings, names of gods and names of private people. This part deals with the discoveries between Saqqara and Dashur, the southernmost part of the Memphite necropolis. It is the starting point for any research into the Saqqara area and into the lives of the inhabitants of Memphis during the Pharaonic era."
3,I'd call you a liar if you said you didn't love Culture Club in their hey-day,"If you're over the age of 25, I'd call you a liar if you said you didn't love Culture Club in their hey-day. Live in Sydney captures the group at the height of their popularity with a fifteen song set that mixes longtime favorites with rare gems. the lighting, performance, and production may not be as slick as the DVDs put out today, but it's Boy George's voice that carries the show. Although it's an average show, it's a perfect slice of eighties pop culture."
3,George live in Sydney,"I purchased this DVD because this concert was the first ever concert I attended as a 15 year old. It's in my collection for reasons of nostalgia, rather than musical reasons.It's like looking at old photos. Mikey Craig's hair should have it's own credit and Helen Terry was Culture Club's secret weapon for three albums."
3,GETTING YOUR MUSIC IN FILM & TV WITH BREVITY,"There are now many books on the marketplace that explain how to get your music into film and tv, but there are very few that can be read in a couple of hours (or on a plane ride). This book is literally a crash course in copyrights, performing rights agencies and there functions; the role of film directors; executive producers; music supervisors; clearance companies; agents; music publishers; and music brokers. His USPs (unique selling points) are simple lessons that can get musicians to think like marketers as he stresses that marketing is the most important thing in your career and he views getting your music into film and tv as means to that end. Good primer."
1,Messy and Poorly Designed,"The handle is way to small to fit in an adult's hand. The hose is too stiff and tries to stay coiled. The pause button is difficult to hold down. The entire unit is very loud especially when you try to pause it. I bought mine tonight, but it will be returned tomorrow. The pulsating water does seem to do a decent job of cleaning if you can get good enough to apply it properly. I do not recommend purchasing this unit!!!!"
1,total piece of junk,"Ok, I'm an idiot. My 3rd (or 4th?) Water Pik has given up the ghost after 2 months. The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle. The latest one leaks water and so it's obviously an electrical hazard."
2,great when it works,after 3 months stopped working. why would company want to acquire a bad reputation by selling such a poorly engineered product.
2,Leaking after 1 day,"Started leaking at the handle after 1 day of use. I like the features, but will return and consider other models. Previous waterpik lasted 5+ years."
1,FANTASTIC--BUT 100% FAILURE RATE. 2 OUT OF 2.,"The WaterPik name and reputation and past experience led me to an enthusiastic purchase of this item. Work(s/ed) great until it die(s/d)a sudden unforseen death. I thought the first one being bad was just a fluke...one out of many, etc. So, I returned it for replacement. I mean it r-e-a-l-l-y was effective. But the product life...isn't!! The first was purchased/delivered on Feb. 20/22. The second arrived on March 1st. Today is March 7th. Today the second one died. If third time is the charm, I'm afraid I won't be taking that chance...I want a refund!"
4,"Feeling Clean and Fresh ,aaahhhhhhh ! all the time.",Me and My husband have a bridge that needs to clean all the time certainly help us . its easy to use and effective.
3,Sticks and must be repaired after 3-4 months.,"This item works well when it is working. The jet can be adjusted depending on how much pressure you desire. Problem is that the mechanism that pumps the water tends to stick. You can shake the item or click the switch on and off and this will usually get it running again. However, after 4 months mine gave out. I had to take it apart and manually turn the gear and oil the mechanism. It is once again working, but what a pain."
2,Please don't use bleach to clean your teeth,"Despite the ""advice"" of the dental hygenist mentioned below, please do not use a diluted bleach solution to clean your teeth. Bleach is toxic. Use diluted Listerine or other antibacterial mouthwash.I bought this model, and the jury is still out as far as reliability. Mine worked the first time, at least. I have to agree that it is amazingly loud, even with a towel underneath. And yes, I fear my neighbors will think I'm running a lawnmower in the bathroom. The tongue scraper attachment seems worthlessly small; buy a stainless steel one instead for $3. Yes, the cord is too short and the unit is difficult to maneuver. But if you follow the directions enclosed in the package, you won't make such a huge mess."
4,"Clean braces, but gums can bleed","I have braces so I got this to keep em clean. does a great job for that but the high setting can make your gums bleed....also pretty noisyoverall, does a good job in cleaning out the mouth"
2,Bad motor,"We bought the WaterPik WP-60 last week and the motor has failed on the second day. I really liked it on the first day, but if it cannot last, what's the use?"
1,Cheap Junk,Foolish me read these reviews and still decided to give it a try.It worked for 4 days before the hose detatched from the handle. 4 days.Shame on Waterpik.Shame on me.
3,"WaterPik is a great product, but ...","I received my Waterpik, and within two weeks, the pump failed. A replacement unit was sent and received within ten days, but there was a large piece of plastic rattling inside the unit. I am hoping the third one is a charm. They are a great product and do an excellent job,- when they work. I have decreased my dental visits because of good dental hygiene, and these units contribute greatly."
1,Can't Someone Design A Decent Waterpik??????,"This is the 4th waterpik I've purchased in the last year. The latest one was purchased earlier this week and after only 2 days of use, the motor has frozen up. What a pile of JUNK!!!!!! The one before that lasted 3 months until all the water leaked out of the handle. Whose building these things?????..........."
2,"It worked great, but only for 10 days","I loved it. It's very powerful. It cleaned every thing from in-between teeth. I used it twice a day. But after only 10 days, the pump stopped working. I sent Amazon an email, they sent me the replacement right away. (Great service from Amaaon). I hope the second will last."
1,Piece of junk,"Like so many others, I've found this worthless piece of junk has about a 3-month lifespan before it stops working. I've had two of them die in exactly the same way.Save your money, don't support this badly designed and overpriced peice of junk"
4,Great product...,"But very loud. Any adults/ teens with braces should definately get this product. It helps clean up any residue food particles that my have escaped your brush and dental floss. I havent experienced any of the problems some reviewers seem to have, I think its only a matter of using the product as specified by placing on a flat surface, priming the attachment before every use and ensuring that the reservoir is firmly in place. I only concede on the fact that it is pretty loud, with the exception of that one factor its a 5-star product!"
2,Defective Hose,This item has a lousy hose... over time becomes brittle and almost impossible to fix.Splits keep occuring - ok if you want a shower - poor hose material makes an otherwise good product very frustrating to use.For a real adventure try to go to their web site and get a real body...
4,It's fine but a simpler model is good enough,I bought this model and another inexpensive personal model as well. The personal one is good enough and saves you money. My son wears brace and uses this everyday. It helps a lot.
2,sorry gang...it ain't all that!,I was excited to see this as a DVD and ordered it immediately. We watched it once and added it to the Peerflix list! It's worth watching once - if only to remind us that we all get older and aren't what we once were. I'm truly sorry I can't give it a better review!
5,Class Act,"Wow.....John Kay is a class act. He's mellowed with time but hasn't lost a step as a rock and roller. I loved the interviews with John and his band mates....they have allot of respect for him, and as one of them mentioned, it's not the John Kay show with a back up band.....they are a true band and they're all make up Steppenwolf. I enjoyed all the extras (watch that Last Wolf Fest sampler......wow, this is a band who loves and respects their fans as much as their listeners love them......very cool). Most aging rockers embarrass themselves 30 years later.......Kay and company deliver the goods here, and the Steppenwolf songs have surprisingly stood the test of time well. Kay has no ego and is a gentle, thinking man.....a great package of music, and the extras help us really understand these guys. A really terrific package."
3,John Kay hasn't lost a step.....,"John Kay hasn't lost a step.....However - the package is misleading. There is no DD-5.1 - It is a Dolby 2.0 stereo soundtrack only - though an acceptable Dolby -2.0 soundtrack at that. But not what the packaging describes it as. Also, the video is not all that good either. It looks better on my 36"" Toshiba than on my 65"" HDTV - but not a good video transfer. A good compilation of Wolf tracks but I am sorry I purchased it because of the audio/video quality...."
1,calculator - doesn' work well,This calculator has been nothing but trouble since we received it - it locks up and just stops working. would not order again.
1,This is School Property,"I expected not new, but usable silver graphic calculator. However, first when i opened, i was shocked at the yellow cover color. And inside of calculator, it evidently has mark showing that this is school property. I do not know if this calculator is stolen from high school or sold by high school. However, this is bad. I would understand if this worth couple of dollars. however, the seller sold it for above $70. If one has conscience, one should not sell this kind of used product to other people...no battery, scratches everywhere, mark saying SCHOOL PROPERTY, dirty, different battery cover, i rather would buy a NEW one. Disappointed."
4,Good calculator,"The TI-84 Plus Silver Edition is a good calculator to have for college classes that require them, ie. Statistics. I don't know if I would pay the full 100$+ for a new one, but my second hand was just as good. It requires 2AA batteries, and so far (3 months of average use for Statistics class) it's still going strong.Everything I use it for it does it fast. The most time it uses is a few seconds and that only happens with the more advanced problems. The display is big and clear and the best thing of all, it is one of the more popular ones out there. This means when I had a problem figuring out how to solve something, all I had to do was type in the problem I was working on + TI-84 in Google and bam!! many sites and youtube videos to the rescue."
4,wet and squeezed,"ti-84 is a great calculator. however some warnings - don't keep it in your backpack if it's raining (it will never work again if it gets wet), and don't squish it in with books (the display will have black marks)."
5,It was quick!!!,"Very Fast!! Thanks!! If I need to order again I will! Thanks for the discount card!!!The Pastor will love it!!!Regards,Emi Aguila"
5,grandparent,My grandson who is 13 was given this item as a present. He is a great math student and has enjoyed this calculator immensly. He is excited for all the programming he can do as well as games.
1,Devours batteries,"I purchased this calculator for college and it works fine for the most part, although there a couple quirks about this model that it took me and my professor some time to figure out. The main problem I have with the calculator is that if you use it and shut it off, the next time you go to use it the batteries will be dead. It continues to feed off the batteries even when powered off. I have to actually take the batteries out after every use. I've never seen anything like it. I don't know if it's a problem with my particular unit or if this is a common problem, but it is extremely aggravating, not to mention expensive."
3,Piece of glass,This was purchased to replace one that had a cracked LCD after being dropped on the floor. Not very durable or economical to repair.
1,Wrong calculator,"I didn't get the calculator that was in the picture... But I did get a calculator, just not the one I order... I didn't want to go thru the hassle of returning it... And then waiting for the next one... Thanks"
1,money wasted on used calculator,"Do not buy it used. The description was deceiving. It claimed to be in good shape. There were dark spots on the screen. I was willing to overlook that part, but after just a few day of simple use for my math homework, it turned on me. The ""-"" button would press itself multiple times to the point where there were just lines and lines of ""-------------"". Then, I would try to turn it off, and it wouldn't work. I took the batteries out just to get it to stop. Then when I turned it back on, it just continued. Oddly enough it started to work again...but only for a few minutes. I'm gonna have to buy a new calculator."
3,eh...,"I got the calculator and it's clean and works fine, but it did not come with the usb cable. Kinda disappointed but other than that, it's alright..."
3,strange happenings,"I ordered a plus silver edition graphing calculator described as ""almost new"". The calculator arrived days later than what I was told. The calculator was not silver. Beware of the term ""almost new"". The term is too broad. It has scratches on the back and some on the front. So far it works fine. Thank Goodness."
3,Decent value.,"Bought this for my girlfriend's college algebra course. Served its purpose. Did not come with drivers or data cable however, but worked out okay. Expensive, but comparatively not a terrible value."
4,too expensive,owned it for 8 years until i lost it in school. i abused this machine during those 8 years and its performance never faltered.i would have purchased it again but decided the cost was too much and i was paying for features i didn't need. there are much cheaper graphing calculators available that are equally if not more capable than the ti84 but simply dont have the perks or the popularity of TI. have a look at the casio's and hp's
5,Great !,One of the best Texas Instruments Calculators.Excellent for secondary studies. Great design.A lot of programs ( download on : http://www.ti-bank.fr.st ).
2,Displeased,"The item I received was supposively in new condition. When I received it, there were dark spots on the screen, scratches all over it and th pervious owners name scratched in it. That is not new condition. I also received this product 3 and a half sweeps after I placed the order."
5,Went above what I expected.,"When I got the package in the mail I really wasn't expecting much, but the quality of the calculater I got was really good. It felt like it was new to me."
3,Could have been cleaned up.,"I think the description over rated this one. We are hoping it works fine. I felt it could have been packaged better in shipping and I had to clean it up before giving it to my granddaughter, In hindsight, I would probably just buy a new one that had the book and the cord to go with it."
4,Good,Good and fair price then the original one and I use it for statistic class and it has so many functions.
3,calculator is great; PC interface software disappoints,"The TI-84 Plus Silver Edition is a powerful calculator with almost every function that one could desire, a powerful programming environment, and a well-organized keyboard.On the other hand, the calculator-computer interface is slow and the PC software is limited and poorly documented. One can transfer programs from the calculator to the computer or vice versa, but this capability is not documented in the user manual. I would like to be able to edit a calculator program on the computer, but it appears that this is not possible.I also have one complaint with the programming environment-- There should be a ""break"" or ""done"" command to exit from a loop without using a goto.Based on my current knowledge, I would rate this product at 4 stars rather than 3 (Amazon does not permit me to change this).Dr. Phillip M. Feldman"
5,Texas Instruments TI-84 Plus Silver Edition,"My high school is making us buy these calculators, and I want to say it is definately worth the price! This thing works wonders, and it will do ANYTHING Math-realated that you want to do!!!!!! I would strongly encourage you to buy this calculator. It also comes with a great unit converter and the periodic table, so it's great for students like myself to use. BUY THIS CALCULATOR!!!!! You can also hook it up to your computer through a USB cable, so you can view your screen that is on the calculator, on your computer monitor, and you can back up and restore your RAM memory."
4,Very good,I find this calculater easy to use and fully functional. It has come in very handy with the engineering course I am taking at night. It remembers and shows long equations that is a very handy feature.
5,Great calculator,"This TI-84 plus silver is AWESOME.The features are extensive and it's easy to use. I do find the ""mini"" manual a little sparse on instructions but there are lots of sites online with explanations when you need to figure things out the first time.GREAT piece of electronics."
5,The best choice for school,"I found that this calculator is the best the best choice. Most teachers use this one, and some math boooks contain tips on how use it. I bought this one as a gift and customized it with an orange faceplate and cover. The one problem we have with this calculator is that the software will not download onto a computer running Windows Vista. The price was good and the shipping was quick."
5,great product,I bought this computer because I am in college and will be taking a lot of different types of math classes and I found that this device offered everything that I could possible need. It is hard to use if you are not familiar with these scientific calculators. The product is great and worth the money if you are going to use it to the max. Highly recommend. Once you understand how to operate the device you will love it!
4,TI-84 Plus Silver Edition Graphing Calculator,"This is an easy to use, quick to learn tool, that makes any mathematical experience pleasant. Although the manual looks daunting, it is very clear on most functions. I mostly use the periodic table on the application list for my science, and then of course, the statistical and graphing functions are a breeze."
3,Hard To Learn!,"This calculator is very hard to learn. Also, I had to reinstall the OS three times because of errors I was getting."
1,calculator,"Nice size, easy to see keys, good for advanced high school or college math classes. Bought it for my son."
4,good,it is good but it's really not easy to use it for mebesides it is so expensivecan it be cheaper?oh my gosh
3,TI-84 Plus Silver Edition,"I had to purchase on of these for my Algerbra class this semister at school. The calculator works great, but it had writing and was obviously very used from looking at the cover. Other than that, it works great!"
4,Overall nice calculator,"The TI-84 Plus is an overall nice calculator, and pretty durable. I've dropped it several times and no visible damage to date. I'd like to see ""Matrix"" have it's own button, and ! (factorial) be easier to get to, but overall a nice calculator."
5,Works as expected,"Required calculator for any high school or college student. Can't live without it if you are attending math classes, so a review is worthless besides the fact that it works fine."
5,great buy,"great buy thanks for the calculator. came with everything promised, cd, cable and calculator case was also included in the purchase."
5,Very Impressed,"For the price, I was expecting a few cosmetic problems with the calculator, but I was very pleased to see that everything looked nearly new and worked flawlessly. Should I run into any problems with the functionality of the product, I will update this review. Also, I ordered this calculator on August 16th, and I received it only two days later on August 18th with just the normal shipping! I was very happy with this seller and product. Excellent and a low price!"
3,get it but not reliable,This product is not reliable at all. It gets hang and you have to take out the batteries and it waste so much of your time. If i was buying this for taking a SAT than i wouldn't be doing that. Overall it does the job and every thing else is good.
3,Good buy,"Bought this for my niece so she can use it for her ACT exam and throughout college and so far no problems with it. Came with all the necessary components, pdf manual, and batteries.I suggest if you need one, purchase from this buyer."
3,Why so serious(ly expensive)?,"This same basic design has been around for well over a decade and hasn't dropped in price. Why is that? What other electronic gadget has done that?Any iPhone/android/smartphone is FAR more powerful than this dinosaur, has a much greater resolution color display, and EASILY connects to your PC with a usb cable. Plus, you know, you probably ALREADY HAVE ONE IN YOUR POCKET RIGHT NOW. How has TI been able to milk this cash cow for so long? There is NO reason to purchase this calculator other than the fact that it's required for your school. Why, exactly? What a racket! That xkcd comic was pretty much on the nose."
2,"Great interface, but hardware is ancient","The TI-80 line of calculators has a very easy-to-learn interface, and this is probably the reason it has become the de facto standard calculator in highschools and colleges across the country.But would someone please tell Texas Instruments that it's 2009? We don't measure processor speeds with double digit MHz anymore, nor do we measure ram in kilobytes. Not that they need to use world-class hardware, but on the TI-84+ it takes about three seconds to graph sin(x). If my similarly priced nintendo ds and slighly more expensive iphone touch can render 3d graphics in real time, why can't my calculator graph sin(x) in less than 3 seconds? I think for over $100 dollars, Texas Instruments could make a much faster calculator (and a higher resolution screen wouldn't hurt either)."
2,"Nice Calculator, but TI won't fix Mac software","If you've got a remotely modern Mac (running Lion or Mountain Lion) you're out of luck with the TI 84. TI's connect software apparently relies on older libraries that don't exist on modern (i.e. in the past five years) OSX versions, and TI hasn't addressed this problem in HALF A DECADE.So if you want to update your calculator, back it up, load software, etc., and if your Mac runs modern Mac OS, it's not going to work.TI, I'm sorely disappointed in you."
4,just the right thing,I LIKE shopping on Amazon. The product is right there with the pricing. It was just the right thing I was looking for. It's easy and eco friendly (no driving all over the place).
5,TI-84 Calculator,Item was in good shape. As good or better than the ones supplied to my child at the local high school.
3,Wish,"I recived the iteam. It works the only thing is, it's rechargable and I had no idea. It did not come with a cord, or directions, it was a little dirty (I cleaned it) but I was still happy I did not have to pay full price for this."
2,TI-89 Titanium,"Ive used this calculator for awhile, then switching to the TI-89 Titanium I realized the TI-89 Titanium is in so many ways better then the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition. The TI-89 Titanium has a Symbolic Math Guide which will show you the answer and the steps it took to solve it. Either get a TI-89 or TI-89 TItanium!"
2,"OK Caluclator, overpriced , supposedly needed for high school BUT my kids I-touch 4th generation does all the same functions","This is a Good Calculator (quality and durability wise) and was needed for son for 10th-11th grades inhigh school BUT my boys soon learned their I-touch 4th generation does all the same functions, with apps which are MUCH easier to download than downloading via TI to its devices.In fact the I-touch displays are bigger and MUCH easier to use than using multi-button key strokes of calculators like this one...ex; <2nd + shift + who knows hwhat other keys....> to do anything... eeeegadsMy ADVICE is if you have an IPhone, IPAD or ITouch 4th or beyond, see if it can be ""apped"" up to do what you kid needs before spending $150-$200 on a single function calculator of any brand."
5,"Shiver me timbers, this book be scurvylicious!!","DK eyewitness books are some of the greatest non-fiction books around. The distinctive white background and high-quality photography gives this book an edge over any other pirate picture book. And -- these pictures are real! They're beautiful photos of historically piratey things, accompanied by informative captions and text.Learn about Anne Bonny, a fearsome female pirate, peruse the pictures of pirate treasure, from Spanish doubloons to richly ornamented crosses. Compare the different pirate flags, and learn about who made each one. Check out the different types of ships, authentic pirate clothes and weapons, and a storehouse of other REAL pirate information.If you know someone (young or old) who is fascinated by all things pirate, then you must introduce them to this book! It's a visual crash course in pirateness, and it's excellent!"
5,"Aye, Aye... Matey!","A little gem! This wonderful book about pirateology is supposed to be for kids, but don't get fooled, adults may enjoy it as much as children. Great pictures, and pretty good information about pirate life in general, in spite of being only 72 pages long. Get this book along with any pirate book by Angus Konstam and you'll have plenty of historical facts and information to increase your knowledge about those fascinating predators of the seas. Totally recommended!"
2,Not for very young children,This book is not for young children. I purchased this for my 5 year old who is just crazy about pirates and I was did not end up giving it to him. Heed the age recommendations. There are a few disturbing images of pirate punishment devices. It is an informative and interesting book for older children though.
1,Crocodile tears from a Thimbleberries Fan,"Why the tears? Cuz I'm used to the quality of the Thimbleberries books and this one fell so far short. If you are looking for a quilting book don't get this. It has pretty pictures, a few projects (though they are the same as in her other ""real"" books). This would be strictly for the person interested in decorating or a pretty coffee table book. I was hesitant to buy it because the book plainly states decorating, collecting and inspiration...well I was right. I will be returning this book and I have never done that before. So that should give you some indication of just how bad it is. For decorating it is way too cutesy and it's very thin on quilting and projects. Only good for the pretty pictures. Before spending money on this get it from your local library to make sure you are happy with it."
4,Christmas charm,I enjoyed this book because Christmas is my favorite holiday and I love interior design. It was a good book for designing ideas.
4,Nice Storage,Easy to put together. Have one in my garage and one in my kitchen area being used as a sort of pantry. Well made. I like the Sterilite stuff. Use this brand for other storage needs.
5,Assembled in a Flash!,"Half the price of a leading competitors similar unit, More sturdy after the build, and the fit and finish was great! This is a much heavier unit than I expected for the price.Talk about ease of assembly, absolutely no tools required! (I did use a folded towel to tap sections together to save my hands)I would recommend this cabinet for storage anywhere in the house, and the price was right!"
4,Easy Assembly,"This cabinet will make excellent storage for small items in the garage. I bought it for the kitchen to store can and dry goods. Although it works, it is not the most suitable kitchen furniture. It was very easy to put together."
5,Strong and durable,This is my second time buying this utility cabinet because it is strong and easy to put together. It has lots of space and can use a padlock.
4,almost perfect,"This cabinet is strong, sturdy and simple to assemble. However, it is only a bit more than 2 feet wide. That's TWO FEET! It looks tiny in my basement corner and holds a lot less than I orginally anticipated...It should be AT LEAST 36 inches wide... Having said that, it is still very sturdy and extremely functional just off the mark a bit on size and price."
3,Easy to assemble but has no metal,"The instructions were better written than most. Found this after a search on Amazon site for ""metal cabinet."" Unfortunately this cabinet contains no metal. This is OK in the sense that no screws are involved but bad in respect to my desire for a fireproof cabinet. The plastic is thick and sturdy, but the doors do not close tightly."
3,Too expensive,"This same item, walmart has it for under $80.00. Amazon had it for $81 last week plus free shipping and inflated the price to $144! It is still a good cabinet for a small area but not worth all that money."
5,Very Big Hint for you,"I purchased 4 of these from walmart a couple of years ago. I am still using them today. The BIG HINT for you is to turn the shelves upside down every few months. If you use these for can goods or heavy items, the shelves will in fact begin to bow in the middle. Simply turn the shelves over every few months. Actually, the shelves in the upside down position, are stronger. You'll have the grooves on top when you turn the shelves over, but for the most part, that is ago, actually functions as dividers of sorts."
5,awsome,it is great for my needs and exceeds my expectations. I recommend this to everyone who needs to store things.
4,outside storage unit,"bought this for gardening and backyard item storage--needed a place to keep things away from our young dog. Good instructions for assembly, went together as described and does what I want it to do. It does have a hole through the doors to insert a lock or latch but found it was a little awkward to access so just close the doors tightly and no problems so far."
5,Perfect Cabinet!,"I was hopeful that this cabinet would be as it was described. It was! I am using it on my back patio. We have an outdoor kitchen and it works great for keeping oven mits, utensils, paper towels, bug spray, sunscreen....DRY!!!!We also have toys in it. The shelves are big enough and deep enough for bubble machines, sand toys...I am thinking about getting the 1/2 size one now for our shoes to go in on the patio. It was very easy to put together and it is very sturdy!Well worth it!!!!"
3,It's ok.,"Very durable, with the exception that the pop-in doors seem to want to fall off everytime you open or close them."
4,Good storage unit,The unit is easy to put together. It is sturdy and holds a lot of items in it. Turned out to be just what we needed.
2,Very poor quality cabinet,"This cabinet is not worth the sale price, let alone full price. I've had the cabinet for about a year now. The hooks that hold the doors to the cabinet itself have already broken off. Both of them. The top is supposed to snap into the sides and back, but was poorly formed and has never been able to. To remedy this, I keep a 20lb stone on top to keep it on so water doesn't seep in. Also, I keep a couple of slate stones on the floor of the cabinet to weigh it down, as the slightest wind topples the whole cabinet. Lastly, the doors do not stay closed, so be prepared to use twist-ties through the door handle holes to keep the doors from being wide open every time you walk by it. If you go with this cabinet, do not use it outdoors. Pay slightly more for the Lifetime or Rubbermaid and only have to buy it once. I learned the hard way."
5,Compare Prices at Home First,In Michigan this costs $69.99 at Wally's World and $69.99 at Meijer. It's $59.99 at our local hardware store. $89.99 is $20-30 more than you can get it for today at a B&M store.
3,"Great for light items, but nothing heavy","This was super easy to put together, and fits very nicely in the tightest of spaces.But, you can not fill it with heavy stuff, except for the bottom shelf.Overall, for a light duty kitchen cabinet, this has been perfect. Easy to move, easy to use, and easily organized. I wish it could handle heavier items like canned goods, but for the price, I'm not being too picky. If it could handle heavier stuff, I would give it 5 stars."
3,About as expected...,"This product is all right for the garage, but you need to make certain the floor is level in that area or the cabinet shape will distort (this can also happen with metal cabinets) and the doors won't close correctly. The only real problem was the poor design of the door latches. They are more trouble than they're worth. I ended up removing them with a hacksaw blade. The doors still stay closed due to friction at the bottom."
3,"Not exactly ""by Funakoshi""!!!","Although the book is announced to be written by master G.Funakoshi, only a 10% of it was actually written by him, the other 90% are commentaries by G. Nakasone. Despite this the book is quite inspiring in the advanced study of karate."
5,A GREAT AND KNOWLEDGEABLE BOOK,"This is an excellent book. It is an easy read, and covers the important spiritual, social, physical and practical parts of Karate. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what Karate or martial arts in general is really about."
4,Should be required reading by any child in Karate,"This is it folks!Easy read and addresses the ""DO"" part of ""Karate-DO"".... To the ""way"".""There is no strike in Karate"" means so much more than most people would understand. Sure... we all know (I hope) don't hit first.... But... what about once the confrontation is already underway... this principle always applies through any confrontation. This is the biggest case for continued dedication to learning a martial art and in my opinion should be the motivation behind submission styles. Read it and understand."
5,Martial arts is a lifestyle,"After reading this book, the simplicities - and complexities - of martial arts make more sense. This book is a tremendous complement to a first degree black belt! So simple to grasp the concepts, yet so difficult unless you are quiet and thoughtful."
4,A New Attitude: 21 Days that WILL Change Your Life,"This back-to-the-basics book isn't about the latest workout techniques or philosophies touted on late-night infomercials. Nor is it an unmotivating work that you'll soon want to tuck away with your other books full of ""good intentions."" No, this is a doing workbook that you can begin at any time, at any fitness level.Some people say that `old habits are hard to break.' Batz responds by demonstrating that you can establish new, healthy habits and develop a positive attitude towards reaching your fitness goals."
3,when music is sometimes good,"I only have one problem, really, will Robert Pollard. He needs to be more selective on the songs he chooses to release! You can't just release every single song you write! Even John Lennon couldn't get away with that. Some of the songs on Not in My Airforce are really good, for instance, ""Maggots Turn to Flies"" which has a grunge guitar riff and a mechanical drum track. Other songs are so short it's not ever funny. Why would you make a song 1:23? Is anybody really going to get what you're trying to do in that short of a song? Not me! At least Tobin Sprout makes his songs three minutes long. With some better editing and a little more effort on the recording process I could of given this album four stars! I would recommend Alien Lanes to the new collector."
2,Poorly Constructed,I ordered this for my 100 pound Lab as he loves to swim but tires quickly. The first day I put it on him.... before he even got in the water the side seems pulled apart.The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one is because I like the design of the vest and how they made the part under the chin very buoyant to help keep his head up as well as his body.I tried to sew the seems shut with my machine but it didn't work. I may try to hand sew them shut but I doubt it. I will probably shell out more money for a vest that is constructed better.
4,"Works well, but very stiff","I bought this for my 85 lb lab.The underbelly section is a tad long for male dogs. It rubs just in front of their ""boy part"" and looks like it may be irritating after a bit. I think I'm going to cut this section out and give it more room.Also, the bottom part should be mesh in my opinion, not solid fabric. He gets very hot with his chest and belly covered up in a double layer of thick neoprene.Also, it's VERY stiff. It's hard for him to lie down but he gets used to it. I wash it on occasion to hopefully soften it up a bit as time goes.I still gave it four stars because it does what it's supposed to by helping him float and is highly visible."
4,A refreshing visit from the relatives!,"Such a fun read, even the sad stories since they, too, are part of our shared history. Can't wait to make the pernil. Helped me understand the crazy notion of ""asalto"" that I grew up with but had no idea was cultural in nature; I just thought my Dad was nuts. As a second generation ""born here"" there was so much I had an inkling about but this book taught about our history and traditions in the best way possible - through food and music, tears and laughter."
3,Not my Christmas!,"I was hoping, when I ordered this book, I could recommend it to my book-club but I was totally disappointed. I had wanted to educate my fellow book club members about Christmas in Puerto Rico when I was growing up. The Christmas my family and I remember with nostalgia. It was however, something else. It is a recollection of different authors about growing up in some Spanish-speaking country. Stories which sometimes, did not have hardly anything to do with Christmas, as I remember it. I am not saying the writing was not good. I am saying that it simply it did not deliver what I expected. It was my mistake! I am not recommending the book because it will not do what I want!"
5,Unexpected twists and turns will leave you spellbound!,"You have definitely never read a book quite like this! Set within the worlds of the FBI and the Mafia, Someone's Picking the Daisies combines the intrigue of a murder mystery and the romance of a love story - with a bizarre look into the disturbed psyche of a madman tossed in for good measure. It will horrify you at times, and charm you at others. And it will have you questioning your sense of good and evil, right and wrong, up and down. This book is real thriller, a page-turner to the very end. If you're tired of reading fiction with expected plots, you will find Someone's Picking the Daisies an exciting and refreshing change."
4,My poor ears,"This is my first attempt to listen to this album from start to finish with headphones. I'm currently on track 8. If the reader says ""So what's the big deal?"" then they haven't listened to this album. Few survive a Guitar Wolf concert without earplugs and some can't even listen to their records without them. All songs are great and horrible at the same time. The shrill feedback may make one cringe but the chugging fuzz hooks produce incredible gastric effects deep inside one's intestines. Uhhhhhhhh. My personal favs are Missile Me and Link Wray Man.Now I'm on track 11, but I got to turn this off. My ears feel like a piece of pig skin that has been gnawed on by a dog for the last 20 minutes. Time for some Bach."
1,Rocking but not rolling,Guitar Wolf makes me want to run away and cry in my mom's stomache where I came from. I am an ustable man.
2,"Good idea, but not for grays at temple","So I'm starting to have silver hair at my temples, which drives me crazy. They are very thin hairs. This is a giant waxy crayon that you wet and rub on the gray hairs, but for my temples that means the skin under the hairs also turns orange - a dead give-away that it's been colored. Also it's a light orange, so it's not quite bright silver but it definitely doesn't math my auburn hair. I tried rubbing it on my fingers and then just running my fingers over the hairs directly but it didn't cover the silver at all that way. So this is not for me. Maybe it's better for parts near the back of the head."
5,Smokey Dalton's Debut,"Kris Nelscott has done something noteworthy and readerworthy with this first novel in a series of six. With a compelling story, wonderful characters, and spot-on writing, it's everything I look for in a mystery, an historical novel, or any kind of book.Smokey Dalton is a man in the middle of events on the cusp of history. There are mysteries in his past he's powerless to solve, though solving mysteries is what he does. A boyhood friend of Dr. Martin Luther King and a friend to Memphis's burgeoning civil rights movement, he lives and works and cares for others and gets by day to day.It's 1968. A young white woman walks through Smokey's door and sets off a chain of events that will cause Smokey to question everything he knows about his life. Meanwhile, a fire smolders under Memphis and the entire nation, waiting to burst into a flame that no power on earth can put out."
5,Smokey Dalton is a great character,"""A Dangerous Road"" succeeds on several levels. It is a damn good detective story. It is a story about race relations in the United States fifty years ago. It is a love story. It is a story about families and their secrets. All of this is woven about the tumultuous events during the sanitation workers strike in Memphis in 1968, culminating with the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.Smokey Dalton, a black man in the segregated South, struggles to eke out a living as an unlicensed PI. Then (it is almost a cliché) ""SHE"" walks into his shabby Beal Street office. Laura Hathaway, a wealthy young white woman from Chicago, hires Smokey to look into her family history. The thing is, her family history and Smokey's seem to be tied together somehow. And that is the mystery this story turns around.Great book and Smokey Dalton is a great character."
1,disappointment,they sent the wrong tracking info. it took too long to get here. then when it finally arrived it was the wrong item. instead of the log which blossoms mushrooms every few months for several years..they sent a bagcalled a mushroom patch which only is good for 3 months.i am so disappointed and upset over spending my money on this order..
3,I expected something a little different,This tool is best for commercial use. The scraper part is a little too stiff and the handle too narrow to fit well in older hands.
4,almost a rubber mallet; huge spoon,"I bought this by accident; was 'aiming for' the equivalent scraper, didn't zoom in on the picture and bought the spoon version by accident.I was going to return it but treating it as a 'happy accident' because it will be the PERFECT utencil for stirring my chili and getting all that wonderful fond mixed in!4 vs 5 stars because rather than having some internal structure to make the 'spoon' shape have strength they just designed it super super thick making the spoon side quite heavy; it's like a rubber mallet with a dent on one side to make a spoon!this thing is desgned to be used in a commercial environment, scraping out a 5-gallon size mixer etc. it will be comfortable in pots bigger than 6qt and oversized on smaller pots.-awr"
2,If you are looking for a 'stiff' spatula...this is NOT it.,It may be 'heat-resistant' but it is not stiff enough to scrape baking bowls effectively in my opinion. It would certainly be good to stir sauces and the like but it was not what I hoped for.
5,Old Time Bluegrass Music,"I love the real old time Bluegrass Music and the Lllly Brothers and Don Stover fill the bill. I like the old time playing and close harmony. If you like ""real"" bluegrass this is for you."
4,Elated/The three sopranos,"I am so elated to find Tibor Rudas presentation of these great artists. Since I saw them and listened to them onPBS I was hooked, I have been looking around music stores but they are not available, now that I found,I ordered 2. I am very happy. Hi Em"
1,"YEP, I SAID IT. IT HAD TO BE SAID.","If your intentions are to pigeonhole spoon's new album, 'GIMME FICTION', through a scant and grossly overexaggerated 'Telephono' review; By all means go right ahead. However, I would think that if you had enough respect for the band to fork over an exorbitant 60 dollars for one album; Then at the very least, you should be respectful enough to spell their upcoming release, 'GIMME FICTION', correctly. G I M M E F I C T I O N. Not GIMMIE FICTION, not any derivation there of. You elitist music snobs, listening for obscurity's sake, never cease to amaze me.What good is an album, which is supposedly the best of their catalog, if a majority of your fans don't have 60 dollars to spend on a single disc.Continue on."
2,Very Disappointing!,"I purchased this book with high hopes. I am so disappointed with this book! The stickers are right in the middle of the book and you have to almost ""rip"" the book to get them out! The stickers are hard for young kids to find a place for all of them. They crowd the book and make it hard to read! After the stickers are placed, it can be frustrating for young kids, as they want to pull them back off the page. I would have never purchased this book had I known!"
5,Kids love indoor and out.,"My kids and friends really enjoyed this toy. We bought it in hopes of using it inside and it worked out. We were worried at first with the size of the fan, but it isn't that loud. It is very large and won't easily fit in a large sized living room, but we had some trains going down a hall way. The kids just love it and it inflates very quickly. It is pretty easy to put together as well. When connecting the tubes, be sure to pull hard as you are velcroing the tube. You need as much slack as possible, it is a tight fit."
4,Perfect for small spaces and hard floors,"I took my Quick Broom with me to college. Graduation is next week and I'm still using my Quick Broom. It's lightweight and stores away easily in my limited student-dwellings. The brush does need frequent cleaning, especially if you have long hair (which I do). Overall, it's great for quick cleanups and best for hard floors."
2,You get what you pay for...,"When I first bought this vacuum, it worked pretty well, especially on hardwood and linoleum. On carpet, it did not pick up dog hair or fuzz but did seem to suck up dirt and other particles. As time wore on, however, this vacuum's suction power began to disappear. Now when I vacuum, I have to use the attachments (which actually work great) in order to pick up anything, even on hard surfaces. Last week, the handle broke in half, so I am now on the market for a new vacuum. While this vacuum is inexpensive, lightweight, and effective at first, don't count on using it for longer than 2 years."
5,RELAXING WITH JIM REEVES GOSPEL,GOSPEL MUSIC JUST RESTS THE MIND AND BODY AND THAT IS JUST HOW I FEEL WHEN I LISTEN AS JIM REEVES SINGS THESE SONGS..HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL VOICE FOR SINGING GOSPEL OR ANY KIND OF MUSIC..I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM OR CD...
5,GOOD FAMILIAR GOSPEL SONGS,"THERE WAS ONE SONG IN PARTICULAR WE WANTED TO LEARN FOR NURSING HOME MINISTRY ""HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN"". ALL WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL"
4,Jim Reeves,"I bought this cd because of one song...""Scarlett Ribbons"" and was completely satisfied. I could never find the song on another cd and I sung it to my children and grandchildren. I butchered it , but Jim Reeves didn't."
5,Gentleman Jim Reeves - 20 Gospel Favourites CD,"What a wonderful CD !!!! Lots of food for thought and whata beautiful legacy to leave behind. What prompted me to this CDwas one of his others: ""We Thank Thee."" I've listened to it somany times I've almost got it memorized! Would suggest these twoCD's to anyone who enjoys listening to really, really good music,the kind where you can understand the words! J. Jones, Michigan"
4,Works great,"I thought of writing a review for this as there were no reviews for this product. Though I saw 1 recent review with 1 star. I have given 4 stars for the following reason;Pros:1. Yes I do agree that the end which we use to turn the Water Meter (or any other like it) is big. You have to heat it up and press it accordingly with hammer. Though be cautious while doing this as it shouldn't be pressed more than required.2. Worth for the price3. Long enough to avoiding kneeling-down to reach the water-meter in the hole4. Damn strong. Made of Iron.Cons:The handle could have been with a rubber grip to hold. It's grooved so can hurt. Though not a big deal, you can wear hand-gloves if it's hurting you.We got this as we had water-leakage issue in our house. Wrote this review after several months of purchasing this key. Great tool to have for Town-homes/Single-family who have the main water control in front of their house."
3,The Complete Guide to Self-Publishing,"Useful to a degree but there are better, more useful books. Dan Poynter's ""The Self-Publishing Manual"" is more useful and actually lists websites and email adresses for his appendix lists. This guy Ross is obviously ""old-school publishing"". His book reflects the publishing industry's stubborness to adapt to a changing market as evidenced by the inclusion of his preposterous ""checklist"" for picking a subsidy publisher. Page 43. His advice will inevitably exclude 90% of the writers of the world from following their dreams. He seems to tell the reader to steer away from subsidy pubishers but go ahead and use my hand-picked resources in the appendix, who perform virtually the ""same services"", only at incredible rates. An otherwise good investment."
4,Wealth of Information,This is not a book you will just read from cover to cover (though you would gain alot of insight). It's more of a reference book and a very good one at that. It includes almost everything you'd want/need to know about self-publishing. A must for the beginning self-publisher.
5,A Valuable Reference For Anyone in Book Publishing,"There is hardly a week when someone doesn't ask me about self-publishing. While the majority of my work is in traditional publishing, I know some will never locate a traditional publisher. If the person wants to get a book into print, self-publishing is about their only option.Tom and Marilyn Ross lead the reader step-by-step through the various stages of self-publishing. If you are headed to self-publishing, get this book and follow every page. You can't go wrong with such seasoned guides."
4,Learning the Basis of Self Publishing,"When I received this book It was a monster book. I didn't think I could even get to the middle of it, but when I started reading I keep reading It gave me so much information for at the time I was a new writer and was searching for help. Tom And Marilyn Ross, had the knowledge and help which I needed to understand many things about the publishing field. This book covers all you have to do to publish your own book and be your own publisher, but it also told where and how to market. This has been helpful for me to be able to keep my own writing career on track. Thank you. Shirley Kalpin-Olson author of ""The Truth Shall Set You Free"", ""Train Wreck in the Sierras"" and coming soon to Amazon ""Life After Death"" under Shirley Olson."
3,Overrated,"Given the solid-five star rating in the Amazon reviews, I expected this book to be a real gem. Instead, while this book has some helpful tips, much of the book is composed of:-common sense advice;-self-promotion by the authors, including references to other books or organizations affiliated with the authors;-no-brainers such as ""use the internet for research"", ""try a search engine called 'Google'"", etc.; and-home-spun ""witticisms"" or ""words of wisdom"" in the form of quotes from various authors & publishers.To wrap up, this book is decent, and probably worth the money and time to buy it and read it, but you need to wade through a bunch of verbiage to find the parts that are interesting and relevant to you."
2,"I'm in the minority, not overly impressed","Maybe it's because I had already read Dan Poynter's book as well as How to Publish and Promote Online and several others, but I was pretty disappointed in this book. I found very little new information.I wish I had passed on this one."
3,Heavy on promotion and selling; light on actual mechanics,"I was looking for detailed information regarding the actual publishing of the book and while the topic is briefly covered, over 85% of the book is dedicated to promotion and selling."
5,A must for anyone who wants to embrace this endeavor to get their work out there,"Getting your own work out there is more troublesome than one would think. ""The Complete Guide to Self-Publishing: Everything you need to know to Write, Publish, Promote, and Sell Your Own Book"" is a guide to those who want to get their work published through the self-publishing avenue. Publishing a book is not as simple as getting it bound and printed, but promoted and sold in stores. From print on demand services to PR and more, ""The Complete Guide to Self-Publishing"" is a must for anyone who wants to embrace this endeavor to get their work out there."
5,Great book for beginners!,"When I decided to start my own small press, I bought perhaps a dozen books about publishing. The Complete Guide to Self Publishing was the best of them all. It is somewhat outdated (2002 edition) but the information is very solid, practical and well-organized. I carried it around until it became stained and dog-eared."
2,a bit outdated,Luckily I bought this book along with two others. Had I not had the others at hand to fill in the many gaps and bring me up to date on current information I might have thought that the only way to print your self published book was in huge runs on an ink press. The two books that I have used along with this one is Dan Poynter's Self Publishing Manual and Aaron Shepard's Aiming at Amazon -both very useful reads.
5,"So many tips, so little time","A thick book that covers just about all aspects of publishing and promoting your work. If you want to get a book onto the shelves, the book provides a decent overview of the publishing industry, particularly the self-publishing side. It's biggest value, though, comes in the form of tips for promoting your work once it's out there in the ether of the book buying world. Tons of practical advice for blitzing your audience through traditional advertising and online marketing. If the book has any shortcomings, it's that it's geared almost directly toward authors of non-fiction books. However, if you have a hot novel you're looking to blast into popularity, you'll still find plenty of ideas here."
3,No real info!,This book is like most other (how to) books it does not tell you anything that can really help you. I have a feeling that most of the things that someone would need to know about the subject are dirty and unspeakable and it would be like a kiss and tell book filled with dirty details!
4,Tobin's first (and possibly finest),"Sprout's most GBV-like album is a gem of low- to mid-fi pop craftsmanship. His melodies aren't as original as former fellow bandmember Robert Pollard's, but that cuts two ways. Where Pollard's tunes occasionally meander fecklessly, Sprout's are always direct and appealing. Varied, tuneful and engaging eccentric pop."
1,Time for a beer,"How on earth this got a rating above one star is beyond me. With a comendable and highly respectable pedigree of Guided by Voices one would at least expect some good songs. I find this cd weak, incipid and unlistenable, this being particularly applicable to the irritating Natural Alarm and Gas Daddy Gas. Anyone need a beer mat?"
5,"A great, pounding album.","Steve Albini is a genius. He may be a lot of other things, but first and foremost, this guy is the recording engineer (producer) of the 90's, and late 80's. As well as being a member of the great Big Black, Shellac and Rapeman he has recorded the 'whos' who' in indie and alternative rock. And on Silkworm's ""Developer"" he gives it a great, pounding sound, to the drums as always and a very exquisite sound to the guitars and bass. This is a great album with unique force and power."
4,Una Vida con Proposito,"I got what I expected for a used book. All pages were clean, the book looks neat. A few scratches on the edges, it could have being sold cheaper. My friend got one brand new for about three bucks more than what I paid for mine, in a Christian store in our hometown."
2,"Not bad, just not good","I did the 40 day program with my pastor and two others. While we found nothing really wrong with this book, we found little to recommend.As other reviewers have said there are several ""problems"". The use of several versions of the bible certainly seems to be an attempt to make everything say just what the author wants it to say. The use of ""the bible says"" or ""the scriptures say"" without showing where it is actually written is very disturbing. And the ""hawking"" of Warren's other books is just plain materialistic.In short, if a person wants to be told what to do and how to think then this book is for them but if they want a book to help them understand Life and how to use their own brain to ""live right"", then this is not the book."
1,dishonest,looking for Spanish Purpose driven Life-RECEIVED Spanish DIARY of thots on Purpose Driven-for what reason would I want a stranger's diary on Purpose Driven....RIPOFF
3,Bueno,"El libro es un compromiso diario personal muy pequeño donde se te permite reflexionar día a día sobre preguntas de cierta profundidad para asi ir descubriendo (claro, si tú así lo deseas) heridas, aspectos que tal vez no te dejan avanzar, preguntarte sobre ellos: cual es su origen, el por que de ellos, etc; para luego, sanar."
5,Excellent,Este es Un excelente libro que puede contribuir muchisimo a la vida de cualquiera. Es muy motivador y sirve para aprender a lidiar con las situaciones mas comunes de la vida.
5,Excellence life experience,This book will give you an opportunity to really see what your life path should be and how to achieve a better way of living. It is very rewarding.
4,Purpose Driven Life,This cd was purchased as a gift. The cd is well formatted and enjoyed by my mother.
1,Made for kids,This anime was not at all what I was hoping for Gummi Bears is a better series than this. If you don't want any depth in your anime and like boring mindless pointless storylines than get it. Otherwise save your money for something worth watching. really really boring.
5,OH it is the most valuable CD that I have ever bought.,It is great. Worthed every penny that I have paid for
5,Beautiful songs and beautiful voice,"Wow, what a great band. I saw them at Picnic Day in Davis, and they are awesome live. So not fake! The songs are very well written and the band members really know their stuff. Expect these guys (and gal!) to make it big soon. To all you Big Music Labels: what are you waiting for? Sign them!!!"
2,BE PREPARED FOR A LONG SETUP,"The adapter will work, but only after many frustrating attempts to get it properly set-up. Tech support is hard to understand as it is, but pile on top a poor designed software and your life its misserable. Once working I hope and pray it never needs to be programmed again or its back on a 3 hour tech phone call."
1,The Next Great Bubble Boom downloadable version - stay Away,"Please stay away from this version of the book. There is only 5 pages for this book and that too the description of the chapters in the real book. I lost my $4 by downloading this book. I would have given zero stars, if they would allow me to do so. But the least rating I can give is 1 star."
5,Necessary Accessory for ACs,"This head is the only one I'll ever use on a can of air. Drastically reduces the risk of accidental burns, has an ergonomic and clean design and delivers"
1,"Can you say ""common sense""","This author was obviously out to make a quick dollar. Not much thought was put into this piece. It's unrealistic common sense on how one ""should"" act in the workplace."
2,dvd,"Don't waste your money. All this is ,is a bunch of college kids guzzling beer, and so girls showing their breast."
4,The only calculator you'll ever need,I bought this calculator for my AP Calculus class in high school and have continued using it through my junior year of college so far. I've gotten so used to this one that I can't go back to any other kind of graphic calculator.
5,Works,This calculator does everything but your homework sadly. I would recommend this calculator to anyone in high school or college.
5,Nice Unit,"I needed this for a Modeling class however, it has turned into my official do it all calculator. From Statistics to financial. There are a lot of features packed into this machine and you can plug in and update the unit. I even added some games to play while waiting for class to start. For me batteries appear to last for about two semesters. The price seems to have inflated a tad bit though."
4,great calculator,"the calculator does what it needs to do, the only thing that I didn't understand is the ""package"" I ordered. it was suppose to come with a protective skin or something, but it was just the calculator, which is cool. just kind of confused."
5,It works,"Third one of this product I have bought, one for each kid, and it seems to be holding up well. My senior daughter has had her's since 6th grade and while she has beat up the outside, it works fine and it was used when I got it then. This one seems to be surviving my 6th grade son's treatment too. Have never had any problems with any of this model, doesn't eat batteries either which is nice."
2,Not satisfied and not amused,"I paid for this product, and three days later the money was refunded to my account. Apparently they had sold the same calculator to two people, then sold out. I'm sure the product was great as evidenced by it's popularity, but it was rather irresponsible of the company to oversell. I needed the calculator for my math class at college and wasted three days waiting for it to show up."
5,TI Reviewed,"Great calculator. Just what every high school teacher should require students to have. Oh, wait, that's the only reason we bought this calculator. So it's great for a mandatory purchase. Want one? I'll sell you mine."
1,what??,It took time to receive and it came damaged. The calculator only works if it is connected to a computer. I am trying to returne it.
1,Umm WOW.,I was quite puzzled when I pulled the item out of the package.It had the tissue paper you use to decorate gifts wrapped around the inside and on the outside the oh so fabulous brown plastic bag.If you are sending something worth so much i recommend you change your packaging style.It looked very tacky and cheap.On top of that there were some rubber grip pieces missing from the bottom of the calculator. And in it's place: permanent marker.
3,Calculator is fine - service is terrible,"Nothing more to say about this calculator. Works fine. However, seller sold me a used one for the price of a new one. Even has ""Brandy's"" name on the front of the calculator. Going to return this product, item review will be updated as the days go by."
1,Incompetent employees,"I ordered TI 84 plus graphing calculator but I didn't get it according to the estimated delivery. Apparently, one of the employees forgot to put in the order. But I learned about it few days later because I was tired of waiting for my order To arrive so i emailed them.They didn't spot it!!!! Then they were very slow in emailing me back, I had to constantly send them emails about inquiry of my order. Finally, they offered me replacement of my TI 84 plus graphing calculator, which was not even the same as what I ordered originally. Over all I could go on... but I was soooo disappointed in EZCORP."
3,"Good Machine, Expensive",I was told I needed this calculator because I was supposedly going to use it throughout high school and college. I was very unwilling to spend over 100 dollars on a calculator but at least it does all the necessary functions. It is a state-of-the-art machine however its price is a bit discouraging. You'd think by now TI would have made accessible graphing calculators...
4,It's a nice calculator,"I needed a good graphing calculator for my Geometry class, something that I lacked for the coming school year. I looked on Amazon in hope of finding a good, cheaper calculator tat would be able to fit my budget. As soon as I saw the price of this one, I immediately set out to purchase it.The delivery arrived on time; in fact, it came about a day earlier than expected, which, is very good. So thanks to the seller for that. However, the calculator I received was the same kind that the school had purchased, which was rather awkward for me to explain to them that no, I did NOT steal from their supplies.Also, there were a few kinks with the calculator; the cover was scratched with a doodle, and it didn't fit very well. However, I only needed a working graphing calculator, and that was good enough for me.So all in all, four stars for the speedy shipping, and for the usable calculator."
5,Refurbished isn't so bad after all,Everything works fine. No cd came with the calcullator but seller noted that in the description plus it's not a deal breaker. I just went on TI website and downloaded any drives or manuals I would need. Definitely saved $$$ on amazon vs the regular brick and mortar store.
4,Good deal on new calculator,Product shipped and arrived promptly will data cable. Minimal packing but the unit arrived in fine shape. Daughter used it and says it is just like the ones she used in school.
5,I am happy,No complain. I don't have any reason for not to recommend this product. It works just fine. Reasonable price. I am completely satisfaid.
5,Late review,"I forgot to write a review about this, I recieved this product in late 2011 and still have it. It has been literally my companion from 9th grade all the way up until now (11th grade). Awesome calculator!"
3,This calc works great,It doesn't even come with batteries but I guess that is okay because it works perfectly fine definitely a plus for calculus and ib chemistry
5,I love this calculator!,"This calculator is amazing. I am taking a statistics course and by having it, I have been able to save hours of time. You just plug in the numbers and instantly you have the answer. Doing the calculations by hand would be tedious and time consuming. The calculator has also been great for standard calculations and scientific applications, I like how the rubber grips hold it steady on a desk. There are so many different applications it can do, I am still learning.... Great buy!"
4,TI-84,"The TI-84 was required for my 7th grade son's math class. At the beginning of the school year I ordered the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition from Amazon. It worked fine for eight months, then it froze and was completely useless. The math and computer teachers at my son's school did everything to try and fix it, but nothing worked. Since it is still under the one-year warranty, I will try to get a refund, a replacement, or at least have it repaired.In the meantime, my son needs a TI-84 graphing calculator to do his math, so I ordered the less expensive TI-84 Plus (not the Silver Edition) and it is working fine, at least for now. My son says that his new TI-84 is easy to use and has all the functions and capablities to get his math done, and he is happy with it.Lets keep our fingers crossed that this one last more than eight months!"
4,"Good Device, but TX needs competition","The Ti-84 is a great tool, and is much easier to use than the product I used when in high school. As a stand-alone product review, I'd say this is great.Aside from that however, a question. Why is it so darn big? For 1/2 the size you can get a powerful little computer in the form of a PDA or GPS-like device. I think TX needs serious competition to start innovating on design again."
4,Good enough for student.,"I give it 4 stars because there is no 4 1/2 stars to choose from. The functionality is great. It serves its purpose well, but i think the graphic resolution could be better. The diagonal line still zigzagged like the old day. The price is reasonable. Good, usable for high schoolers."
5,The Standard,"This is the second TI-84 I've purchased for my kids. Each one had to have it for their math classes. It was the model we were told to get so it wasn't like I shopped around and picked this model for a specific set of features. Having said that, it's worked well and my other one has worked several years so far."
5,school math,"This calculator has been used for pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, Algebra 2, pre-calculus and Calculus and meets all of our needs and expectations."
4,Excellent price!,"I needed a good graphing calculator for my Geometry class. As soon as I saw the price of this one, I immediately set out to purchase it.I only needed a working graphing calculator, and that was good enough for me."
5,A++ For TI84 plus,"Sure wish I had one of these graphing calculators back in the day (late 70's). Would have made my algebra and calculus classes much easier. Today this has been a must for my college classes, I have even up dated my app's to include chemistry. Visualization on a screen from graphs, equations to the periodic table has increased my learning ability ten fold. Thanks Amozon for the great buy, and TI for a great graphing calculator."
5,Does the Job,"I don't know anything about this calculator, but my fifteen year old son needed it for school and he likes it. Per him - It does everything he needs in his math class, plus he can play games on it and make cartoons!I guess that is okay as long as he is making A's."
1,Great machine poor condition,I received it and then in the battery place there was all this kind of junk. The batteries were old. Ihad to clean the junk with aspoon in order to replace bateries. Overall is whay my title is.
3,Not as product description,"When I viewed the product description, it said in the box would be the cables, sliding case/stand and calculator. It was the calculator but had a old case and no cables. There was writing on the back and a pad of some sort missing. It will do the job and decent price, but for the money I will have to spend for the cable I should I purchased a new one on sale."
3,so-so,"Its not TI's fault.Schools should encourage the use of RPN entry calculators as it is more akinto how PC's operate.The only fault, so far is the blister pack is hard to open, and thehard cover is poorly designed. It does not slide smoothly.Functionally it seems sufficient.pi"
5,TI-84 or 83,"I didn't actually get to use the TI-84 because the used one I ordered was broken. I'm taking a statistics class and had a test coming up soon, so when all I could find was the TI-83+ at local stores, I took it. I was really nervous I wouldn't be able to learn to use the calculator fast enough for my class, but was pleasantly surprised. The menus can be a bit involved, but just searching online led me to a great free guide and I did fine on my test.I've never used any other sort of graphing calculator, so I don't know how this one stacks up, but it's the one the professors seem to recommend."
5,Awesome calculator,"Wow, this SERIOUSLY can bring back memories of DOS. Even better it can have games and all sorts of stuff on it! So.. my sister had this, and my dad noticed it had a calculator to calculator cable and bought one for me. I must say it is very well done.You can even make programs for it! I'm making a Rumble Robot Remote program by making a IR transmitter that can hook up to it.Rumble Robots Interactive Fighting Robots - Clamster<Rumble Robot. So BUY IT, for Pete's sake! BUY IIIITTT!!!"
5,great product,bought the calculator for a college intermediate algebra class and have just started using all the neat features this calculator offers. Would recomend to anyone taking a class where graphing calculator is needed.
5,Ms,I am very satisfied with this product. I would definitely recommend this product and the price was great!!!
5,graphing calculator,The product was ordered and recieved within the time frame given. It is in good working order and easy to use.
4,I wish if I've bought the silver edition,"I liked it but I wish if I've bought the silver edition, especially it is almost the same price.Actually I didn't because I search well."
4,Graphing calculator review,"It workds very well, easy to use. Although it is on the expensive side, through Amazon, it was comparative, if not lower than other sellers. In addition, it arrived much quicker than I anticipated."
1,Stolen?,"I was shopping on Ebay today for one of these and there was a noted review on every one of the listings that said if you are getting the ""yellow"" one, it has been stolen from a school. That these are school issued only to students, so if you see one it's stolen from schools. Just passing this along. I have not verified."
4,Very pleased,Having two children as juniors in high schoolcan get pricey so I was very pleased to get this calculator at a great price in a timely manner. It works great. No complaints.
2,Cannot connect to newer Macs,"The low two stars are for the failure of TI to upgrade the software that allows connecting this calculator to a desktop computer. Specifically, if you have a newer Mac, then you will not be able to connect this calculator to it.This is annoying, as TI has not upgraded the Mac software since 2010. It works for Mac OS 10.4 and 10.5 only; it might work on some versions of 10.6 (it failed for 10.6.8 in my case). But if you have a newer Mac running 10.7 or 10.8 then there is nothing you can do and you will not be able to back up data or programs that you use with this calculator.This is a shame for a product that is more or less a required purchase for most middle and high schoolers."
5,So far so good,Got this for my daughter who is in 11th grade. She needs it for math classes as well as for taking SAT. It was recommended through school and supposedly will be the one she needs in college. We are pleased so far.
3,TI-84 has me stumped,"I have yet to learn how to use the many,many functions of this calculator. I bought this calculator for my college Calc I class. I took Pre-calc 18 yrs. ago and still have the Texas Instruments calculator that I used back then which is way smaller and easier to use. This calculator is huge and the manual is equally as large. I've tried to sit down and read the manual for a better understanding, but that lasts for about 15 minutes before I get bored. I'd probably do better if this calculator came with VHS or DVD instructions."
3,It WORKS...,I hate that it is extremely bulkyI hate that it is still too slowI hate that it is the best thing out thereI hate that you have to go through complicated menus and you still have a lot of buttonsI only use this for graphing.I bought it because it was the only calculator allowed in college
5,100% satisfied!,"I just got my T1-84 plus graphing calculator today, ordered Wed. afternoon..it's BRAND NEW even it was only defined as ""used-like new""..fast shipping too! Thank you..I'm 100% satisfied.."
5,Daughter loves it,"I bought this for my college bond daughter and the price was a lot better than local stores , which is nice because I need to save every cent with price of college , she is very pleased with it. It was the most recommended by her teachers."
4,Does What The School System Wants It To Do,A required item for our school system. Does what it is suppose to do. Works well and a workhorse of the calculator family.My only complaint as with those of others is that it is not available as an app.
4,TI-84,It works good so far. I bought it used and it works good but i am skeptical. I will see in a few months if it is still working.
4,less is more.,"I am on my third TI-83+ (my first two were stolen). My brother owns an 84, and I can tell you that it offers nothing that the 83 doesn't have. Many of the preloaded apps are useless (an address book? please!), and take up so much space that the memory increase is worthless. The 84 is a continuation of TI's tendency to offer huge amounts of style with little or no substance. I prefer the 83 for its streamlined design. The one improvement is that the slip cover on the 84 does not become loose with a great deal of use, which is a problem I have encountered with my three 83s. It looks as though the USB connectivity could be a plus (for the 83, you had to buy a separate connectivity kit to connect to a PC), however, most buyers will not need to connect their calculator to their PC."
4,TI-84 Plus,"Much better than the TI-83 ... Great device, comes with lots of programs the TI-83 doesn't ... but now that I'm using it I would have rather forked out a few more dollars to get more computing power the TI-89 offers. For example ... The TI-84 can't compute factorials above 90 or so... Hope this helps..."
2,Full functioned but not really functional,This calculator has pretty much everything in the world you would need from a calculator but why oh why did they leave out a fraction and mixed number buttons?? The process to enter fractions is frustrating when you have to do it over and over and even the most basic calculators have these buttons. Even the simpler TI-34 has these buttons. It's an omission of such a basic feature like this that looses stars from me. Otherwise it is a great device I just have no idea why something so basic and common isn't one of the buttons. If I wasn't required to own it I would return it for a device with the same features but with the fraction buttons.
4,Calculator arrived as described,satisfied with calculator description and arrival time. Works perfectly and looks exactly as had been described. There were no problems with the manner the product functioned
5,TI-84 Plus Graphing Calculator,"This is a very good product, easy of use, good price and quick shippment. It satisfied all my needs for a college calculus course."
1,don't buy from this seller!,"I wanted a graphing calculator that would last me 3 more years of college so I payed a little more to get a used one that was in ""very good"" condition. What I got was a calculator with marker and pen marks all over it that acts like it was dropped from the 3rd floor of something. It only works when it wants to. It cost me 24 points on my first test because it quit working. I keep buying new batteries thinking it is the batts but lets be real. This calculator is crap! By now I could have purchased a brand new one. Wish I would have..."
5,Math Students Needs,"This calculator was recommended for Algebra, Geometry, Trig and also physics by or local school teachers. It was out of stock in all the local stores that carry it here."
2,Okay... Very Frustrated,"I ordered the TI-84. It came with a Caculator, batteries, two connector wires, but a BLANK software CD. I am very dissapointed with my purchase due to the fact that the cd was blank. Do they not think i need to connect my calcualtor to the computer? Well now i cant thanks alot. i didnt spend 80 dollars for nothing."
2,"Too wordy, not designed for a basic learner","I'm not a writer. I'm a trainer who needs to design a writing course. I need to give people basic tips to write better. This book might have tips, but they're buried in words. It's not a book about how to write better. It's a book about writing.Other reviewers love the book, but they sound like professional writers. If that is you, then you'll also like the book as it talks about the process of writing, it's importance, it's history, whatever. I don't need that stuff."
4,Brief but useful,"This little book has a lot packed into it, which means that it's both manageable and sometimes superficial. Everything the author says has some usefulness, but in the real world of business, it's not always practical. For instance, the author uses an hour to illustrate how to divide time into smaller chunks. In my experience, most business writing needs to be done in just a few minutes. Following the author's advice, I would be hard pressed to squeeze in any significant time for preparation. It's more likely that I would bear in mind the author's advice while writing furiously in the moment. If you're the kind of person who is self-disciplined and can learn independently, this book would be a very good introduction to business writing. There are short exercises at the end of each chapter and a final exam. The author's tips on how to keep your writing intelligible are worth the modest price of the book."
4,Human Crack Rock. Nuff Said.,"More Than Music Vol. 1, to me, is the best Dipset mixtape I've heard so far. I hear oh boy sayin you either love them or hate them. He's absolutely right. You either love dipset or hate dipset. I jus happen to fall in that category of the ones that got mad love 4 em. Production is golden on this album, as I would expect nothin less 4rm dipset (Heatmakerz). As far as lyricism... jus look at my title... Hell Rell is probably the coldest one in Dipset rigt now. JR Writer is right behind him. If either them come out w/ a solo project, ima b tha first 2 get it. Overall, If U got love 4 deez niggas GET THIS HUMAN CRACK ROCK!!!"

1,Students Do Not Purchase,"Are you a student taking a course that requires this book? If yes, do not purchase - this is not the book you need. The book mentioned on Amazon appears to have the CD but it's not included.Search the web for Introduction to Jazz History, by Megill with CDs or ISBN# 0131829319 (just the CDs), ISBN# 0131061895 (book and CDs) - this information is per Peirce College.About the book itself - very well written and appears to be the start of an excellent class."
2,great playing but the tape hiss is intolerable,"The playing is top-notch, but I can't stand the hiss. The CD was manufactured in the early 90's. They need to remaster this album soon; wait for the remaster, it will be worth it."
1,Same ol Same ol,"This guy appears to have borrowed everything he wrote from somebody else, and doesn't stand on his own legs. Obviously an ego-driven motivational speaker who had a ghost writer fill in the blanks for him. No real meat, don't waste your money."
3,A good book for the Christian reader.,"The book starts out great but gets carried away regarding the view on God which was a real turn off for me. The beginning chapters are powerful and uplifting but I became bored later. Christians are not the only readers that need a power boost. Paul is quoted throughout the book, and though Paul surely was a great leader in his time he would not be respected in this day and age for his closed minded version of God or the Christ. One may feel the promise keepers are very near. May no person ever need to become submissive to another and may couples everywhere know that marriage is a union not a train. Lead together."
4,The Power to be Your Best by Todd Duncan,"Motivational expert, Todd Duncan wrote an inspiring book on how one can attain their best in life through determining one's values and then making winning choices based on those values. Duncan achieves his unique approach to personal and professional empowerment by asking readers to answer some basic and critical questions relating to one's purpose in life, values, vision and mission and what one needs to do each day. The answers to these powerful questions become the compass to guide anybody successfully in life.I certainly was greatly inspired as the book nourished by body, mind and spirit to seek a productive and purposeful life. For those seeking to achieve lasting success or those who need to recover from failure or from a reckless and muddled life, then this is the book to read."
1,This book was not worth the money.,"I was highly disapointed by this book. Based on the review, I expected a comprehensive guide. Instead, the scripts was general and would not be much help to anyone but a pure novice. The price of this book is about $40.00 too high. Skip it."
1,Outdated employment agency stuff,The quote on the cover of this ten-year-old book from Robert Snelling of Snelling and Snelling Employment agency says a lot. For that is who this shallow book is suitable for...old style unsophisticated office support agencies. [...]
3,The Recruiter's Almanac,"Good product but less creative than I originally believed it to be. Secondly, I fell it is a $10-$15 book not a $55 book."
3,Parts are good,Parts of the book are good ... written for the 80 / 90 not for the internet / cell phone age
4,Lorus LR3330 watch,"This is a nice, basic watch. I have a larger wrist and I ordered it because the band was listed as being a bit larger. It is, but I wish it was just a little larger than it is. (My wrist is 8.5 inches and I find it a tad bit snug.) However, it works for casual use."
2,Too big,"I thought it would fit me with a small wrist size but it was too big, I was never able to use it. Not good if you have small wrists."
5,Love is not loneliness,"Of course all albums worth reviewing are five stars, and every ""best of"" is so personal as to be meaningless. Cat Power is so insular as to be beyond review. You either feel her pain, or you don't. If you have ever seen Cat Power live, you have been treated to either the most moving or most embarrasing performance of your life-- sometimes both in the same night. Much the same with this album. This is Chan at her most raw, most intimate, most compelling and most distancing. It is almost funny to watch the progression of her career, to see her perform with ""famous musicians"" and to see her on Letterman. She is ultimately an outsider artist, creating something not quite ""art"" but rather a daguerrotype of her soul."
5,haunting,"Chan Marshall can do haunting like no one else...both aggressive and lonely, her songs sound to me like Kim Gordon meets Kristin Hersh...but admittedly it is unfair to pigeonhole her unique expressiveness. When I first acquired this album (after falling in love with Moon Pix, which is also beautiful but does not have the range of emotion or music that WWtCT does) I spent hours late into the night making art while listening to this cd...""Water and Air"" is one of the most aching, chilling songs I have ever heard. There is something creepy underlying WWtCT that makes this album stand away from CatPower's other work - her lyrics do not rest easily."
5,An excellent album,"In my opinion, this is the best Cat Power release. It is more well-rounded than the others, covering a wider range of sounds. It has the typical acoustic southern gothic tone of all her other releases, but is much more varied, taking influence from the Velvet Underground to Sonic Youth. Nude As The News is the closest Cat Power has ever come to a ""hit,"" while the title track is a beautiful excursion into the avant-garde. The cover of Smog's Bathysphere is also a highlight. Definitely worth your time, this album covers a wide scope of emotional terrain and is definitely a work of tragic beauty."
1,Don't Like It At All,"I had heard Cat Power on the soundtrack for the movie ""Juno"". I really like her rendition of ""Sea of Love"". I bought this album based on that. I was very disappointed to find that I don't like a single song on this album. I think it was a waste of my money."
4,Great Starter Album,"The best recommendation for any album is that you buy more albums from that artist. You should buy this album, looking for the right price. Your friends will think better of your music collection when they hear this.The album moves along at pace. The voice is great. All tracks were good. Nothing from left field leaving you wondering why. You may possibly want a little more variety.The last track ""The Coat Is Always On"" left me wanting to listen to the album again, possibly with headphones to hear the background.There are twelve tracks, good album legnth making it value for your dollar. The only downside was there was no booklet."
3,and I still haven't found what I'm looking for...,"I have thick wavy long blonde hair. I'm trying to tame it without spending an hour or two in the process. Unfortunately, for me, this brush is only ok. The size is good for my long hair but the tines are so short that I can only brush a very small section of hair at a time or half my hair blows away. If the tines were twice as long it would be the right brush for me because it would be able to hold larger sections of hair without them slipping away."
2,Not pleased,"I bought this product because a friend recommended it to me ,and being a fan of organic products I thought I would love it! But after a couple times of using it I noticed my face feeling a little irritated like a burning sensation but nothing to painful, so I researched more about the product and found that they had added some harmful ingredients that can being very irritating to the skin and very bad for skin as well. I have to say the only thing I liked about it was the citrus smell. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have a sensitive skin type. good luck !"
4,Makes my skin feel soft and clean,"This cleanser works well. I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser doesn't burn my face like many other cleansers have. My face also feels very soft after using it. It's a gentle cleanser that removes dirt, oil, and makeup without the harsh chemicals. I like it."
3,Love the smell but doesn't work that well,"Smells fantastic, but I still broke out using it. Not the case with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, 9.1 Ounce (Pack of 3)"
4,UM NOT,"THIS STUFF ALMOST COMPLETELY MESSED UP MY SKIN, I STARTED HAVING PIGMENTATION DISORDERS AFTER A WEEK OF THIS STUFF, NOT GOOD."
1,a waste!,"Don't even bother.. Waste of money, right after I applied it my face was red and itchy plus breakouts within two days.."
3,Good,Many of my friends recommended it.I have a dry skin. It was good for me. It smells a little citrus and moisturize enough in this winter (Tennessee).I like it but I'm not sure whether I will buy one more.
1,Refuse at all cost,"Too small, too expensive and misrepresented by Amazon. Please respond to me directly if you are really concerned. I doubt I will get any kind of answer."
1,still contains Paraben,"I cannot believe that this so call ""organic"" healthier cream still contains paraben ( propylparaben) it has been shown to cause breast cancer! many ""health"" products clearly states on ""paraben free"".Disapointing"
1,"Avalon Organic Botanicals, Oil-Free Moisturizer, Rejuvenating, Vitamin C, 2 oz","I don't recommend this product, after reading a few reviews i ordered Avalon organics oil free moisturizer but, within 2-3 days of application i stated developing allergic reaction on my face. Seems some user are happy with this product but m completely unsatisfied with Avalon. i would never buy any other product of Avalon organics. The best thing is Amazon considers return policy and i could return this product."
2,Cleanser LEAKS form Pump!,"Most of the product leaks from the shaft of the pump where it inserts into the bottle as shown in this picture:[...]The product also has a fairly strong orange smell, which I am not too fond of.It does clean my face pretty well, but I think I am going to try ""Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for normal to oily skin"" instead after reading so many glowing recommendations on the internet (not just amazon). Also, there is a CVS generic of Cetaphil daily facial cleanser which has the same ingredients."
4,this is the only avalon product that works for me,"maybe is because I have sensitive skin but the other avalon products either didn't do anything for me (the serum) or were to harsh for my skin and left it all messed up(toner and cleanser), I dunno but I will keep using this moisturizer for a while, the only thing that I am not sure about is that if this is the product that is giving me little break outs on my cheeks or not... anyway, it gives you the right amount of moisture all over the face but if you have combination/oily skin, use another moisturizer on the forehead."
2,It doesn't erase my mascara completely.,"I am assuming this cleanser doesn't make my face squeaky clean because its purpose is not to dry my face out. So I don't want to say this product is bad. But I just don't understand it. Once I am done washing with this product, I have faint raccoon eyes. After that when I use a cotton pad with toner and swipe my face, I am left with smudges of makeup from the day.Maybe this is the way I'm supposed to use it? The product doesn't warn me about it nor does it tell me I have to wash my face twice preferably with another cleanser. Currently that's what I am doing.I am trying to find an organic product without parabens that really works well as a cleanser. I am wondering if this is the best organic products can do without using harmful ingredients."
1,junk,"Avalon ruined this wonderful product when they made it ""more sustainable"". Complaints are rampant and warranted. Don't waste your money - it's chalky and gross. Shame on you Avalon!"
3,"2 formulas - one absorbs, one doesn't...","When I first ordered this product from Amazon, I was thrilled. It was light and creamy, absorbed quickly and smelled amazing. When I ran out, I had no qualms about ordering a multipack. However, when I opened the first jar, I first noticed that the label was different (off-white and orange) as compared to my previous jar (all orange - like in the product picture). Then I quickly realized that the product I had loved was also EXTREMELY different. This new formula does not absorb AT ALL. I was using a pea-sized amount for my whole face and rubbing and rubbing it in forever to get any benefit. When I opened the next box in my multipack, I was happy to see that it was the old formula (all-orange label). BE CAREFUL - you don't know which one you're going to get!!"
4,night cream,not too heavy and has a very nice scent and the price is very reasonable . I would purchase again.
4,Love this product!,I love this product! The cleansing gel has a nice citrus scent. I only use it on my face. My only complaint is that the bottle is made from very thin plastic. First time it dropped in the shower it cracked completely at the base and I had to quickly find another container for it. A 1/3 of it was wasted due to this. Needless to say I was upset considering how expensive it is!
5,Eliminates wrinkles,Eliminates fine lines and makes my skin look moist and fresh looking. I noticed a difference the first week I started using this product. It's great on gentle skin too.
3,Face Cream,Its actually not as moisturizing as I thought it was going to be...but I like it! It smells nice and mild as well :)
3,Eh...Nothing special,"I decided to try this because i need some ""glow"" on my skin. I've used it for two months (at first i used it morning & night for three weeks, but then i only used it at night.) and I'm almost out. Pretty expensive if you ask me. I don't know, but my skin feels dull as usual. Even though the cream is thick, i didn't feel really moisturized. It just didn't work for me."
5,LIKE IT,THIS WORKS ...DONT USE IT EVERY DAY ....YOU COULD OVER DO IT AND GET LOTS OF DRYING! BUT IT IS AMAZING AND DOES EXFOLIATE DEAD SKIN!
3,All natural... but strong smell and irritating to my skin,"I bought this item because I read about vitamin C being good for your skin and it is advertised as all natural. I like the ingredients, but it has a really strong smell that gets annoying, even if you like it. It also ended up irritating my skin, natural does not mean non-irritating. It has orange peel oil, which I am allergic to, to I had to return it.I found a brand with natural ingredients, a nicer more mellow smell and no irritation (alba botanica), which I like better, for about the same price."
2,my face getting worse,It does not appear to do anything for me. I started to break out after using it and after about a week I just couldn't keep using it as my face was getting worse and worse. It doesn't really lather up at all but it is a large bottle so there is a lot of product.
2,getting worse,It does not appear to do anything for me. I started to break out after using it and after about a week I just couldn't keep using it as my face was getting worse and worse. It doesn't really lather up at all but it is a large bottle so there is a lot of product.
1,New formula is a disappointment,"I have bought this product for years, they just changed it and you can see the word NEW on the packaging.The product is so white and the texture is so thick now that you will feel like you are spreading white glue on your face and you look like a clown with white face.I wrote to the company but did not get any response. They also changed the formula of their serum and it is really bad, in fact you can check other review about their NEW line and figure it out.I am very disappointed as I really like the product the way it used to be and now will need to find something else."
4,"Moisturizing, love the scent",I love the orange citrus scent. Moisturizes well. Does not clog pores or break me out. I use this with my RX tretinoin (which dries me out pretty bad) - This helps with the problem.
2,Smells STRONGLY,"VERY strong orange smell. I don't know about anyone else, but I prefer NOT to smell like an orange. I always buy unscented items so they don't clash with my perfume. May be a great cream, but.... I am hoping the smell fades....and fast! Makes me wonder if I'll attract flies when/if I go out with this cream on.It says it can be used under makeup. Don't think I'd wear this cream out of doors.Update: The smell DOES fade after about 5 minutes, though my dog can still smell it. Not sure if I just got used to it or if it faded completely.It would be nice if they could, somehow, remove the smell.Update: The cream does seem to do a good job of moisturizing."
2,stings,"maybe good for some, but my skin, normal and very clear, not being overly sensitive,burned slightly from this product. Have tried other products in this line with the same irritating results. Also, seems to strip a bit. (over tightens)"
4,Delicious Orange Scent But Not For Everyone's Face,"I love Avalon Organics, especially the naturally scented orange (Vitamin C) & lavender moisturizers and creams, but I don't recall labels claiming they are noncomedogenic (non pore clogging). I occasionally use the Vitamin C spf 15 on my cheeks and have had no resulting break-outs, but the essential oils *especially* citrus, are potential irritants and can also cause photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight). I advise anyone who wants to apply Avalon Organics on their face to do a Patch Test if you have oily or hypersensitive skin, dermatoses, or are prone to acne or pimples. Otherwise, there is a risk of breaking out or having a reaction, and the safe route is to stick to using Avalon's skin care on other areas, like neck, hands, elbows, etc."
2,Average Product,"The ingredients in the eye cream is similar to the serum with but thicker in texture. I probably would not be purchasing the eye cream again, since with shipping it costs about the same as the serum, which I like better anyway. I would not recommend this product but would suggest the Vitamin C serum."
5,MY FAVORITE CLEANSING GEL,I love Avalon organics product line!!! This if my favorite cleansing gel for the shower. I bought it originally for my face but it was to harsh for my face so now I use it for my entire body and it leave my skin squeaky clean without overdrying. Thank you Avalon organics for your Vegan & organic product line!!!
2,Breaks me out a lot,"While it is quite moisturizing I really would not recommend this for acne prone skin. The first time I used this I broke out all over the next morning. I stopped using it after that and used it once more just to see if it was this breaking me out... and I broke out again. So overall, while it is quite moisturizing and oil free, there is something in this that breaks out my skin. It's a very heavy moisturizer and I'am definitely not recommending for acne prone skin."
1,What a Mistake!!,"I ordered for:Avalon Active Organics Vitamin C Revitalizing Eye Cream, but they send me another cream for eyes i didn't order for, andWITHOUT EVEN NOTIFY OR ASK ME!!Very disappointed!i didn't like the other brand they send me, so i have to buy for another eye cream now."
2,oil and lotion seperates,I decided to get stuff from a fancy store for once and this product was big disappointment. The lotion separates and a 1/3 of it is oil. There's beads like an exfoliate beads inside and if you sweat that vitamin C really feels like citric acid hit your eye.
4,"Creamy, subtle and lovely","This is a thick and creamy, lightly orange scented cream for face, neck or hands. Very nice.Update...had to stop using this on my face. It makes my eyes burn and my sinuses close off. I'll try it on my hands."
3,A little bit too oily,"the product seems good, but the problem is it feels oily and make my face look shiny if wearing alone."
1,Not for brown skin people,"This product leaves a white film/residue on my face so basically I can't use it. I'm black so if you have lighter skin, it may not be an issue."
4,Pretty good but applies 'white' on dark skin.,"I love the fact that this is one of the safer sunscreens out there. I am a fan of the avalon vitamin c lotions. We are dark skinned and the zinc oxide in this does apply 'white' coverage on our skin. I am still trying to find something that will absorb into the skin easily and is harmless. But until then, this product does a great job."
1,Not Good For Oily Skin,"I have very oily skin and this product made my face very greasy after a few hours of applying it. I'm glad I tried it, but I would not recommend it to someone who has very oily skin."
2,"Eh, not for the sensitive skin",Wanted to check out a new cleanser unfortunately this product was not for me. It left my skin feeling extra dry and burning.
3,Is this new packaging??,"I used this product before (the one pictured) and I liked it but the product I received was not the same...it's still the revitalizing eye cream but on the top under Vitamin C is says ""renewal""...and the box is different too...not enough for me to complain and sent it back but the pictures need to be updated because this is not the product you get."
2,Not as good as stated,I tried this product with a lot of hope for quite sometime. I didn't see any improvement what so ever. I would not recommend buying it.
2,Ehh,It's not smooth going on at all. The original one with out the sunscreen is sooooo much better. Would not buy again.
1,Junk,"I began using the Waterpik many years ago and highly recommended it to anyone who would listen. Unfortunately the company changed a good thing into pure junk. From day one it was time consuming to get the tank/reservoir to fit properly on the base. I bought the unit December 15, 2009 and it's July 2010, 7 months later, and my Waterpik now will only work on the lowest setting. The rest of the settings only produce a loud noise and no water. Now comes the hassle again to get it replaced or repaired.If someone at Waterpik is listening, remember that reputation is everything. Please revert back to ""the good old days"" when you made a decent product."
3,replacment unit,"REplaced a model I had for 15 years. This one is not as handy to turn on, handle or adjust. Has more pressure then old one"
1,A gift that was burnt on first use,"I bought the waterpik for an aunt, unfortunately she plugged it directly to 220 and burnt it."
4,Good value,"I purchased my WaterPik from Amazon , and got a very good price. I didn't purchase the newer model since no sinus irrigator adapter is available for it from either WaterPik or 3rd party suppliers such as Sinupulse. I like the ability to rotate the adapters with your thumb&finger without turning your hand/wrist. Overall I am satisfied with it with only 2 minor caveats . The slider switch on the handle which controls the speed/strength can easily be moved inadvertently during use. ( You could tape it to your favorite position, or simply learn not to touch it while in use)A better design in my opinion would be to put the control on the base unit instead of the handle. Lastly,it is somewhat louder than I expected, and might disturb a light sleeper."
2,Bad purchase,"I purchased 4 waterpiks for my family in the mid '90s, and though model is now discontinued, the same quality was expected. Don't waste your money as I did, because the quality has degraded. The on-off switch is the biggest complaint, since it does not turn on when pulling up as it should. This started shortly after the warranty ended, and it is necessary to push back down toward off in order to get it to operate. It sticks, and slight force is necessary to to push it back. I have tried pulling up slowly, but it just will not start until the switch is on the downward push toward off. Also, they no longer supply the 4 color coded jets as previously, and were careful to see that the extra package purchased for my previous appliance no longer fit. I intend to give this away or throw it away, and have already ordered 4 Hydro Floss for my son, daughters, and myself."
1,You'll Be Sorry,"I have always loved predecessors of this product, but this one is terrible. Its bulky and vibrates terribly. When making your buying choices, select another model number, I wish I had."
2,too much pressure,i tried the product . it has too much pressure i thaught it would injure my gums. i went back to my battery powered unit
1,Machine gets weak fast,"We purchased this WaterPik to replace one that had stopped pumping water and couldn't be resuscitated. This replacement fared no better, its performance deteriorating within the first year of purchase. It would then only work in the lower settings. We just stuck with it, and It did continue to operate at that lower setting for a long time, until finally it would only work at the lowest power setting, then not at all. Too bad, it's a useful tool. I wish some other company that valued manufacturing over marketing would make one that would last."
4,Great product,"This is a good product ! But need improve on the water refill , can be easier and noise when operate."
3,Alright,"I was disappointed because the water pressure was not what I had expected. A bit weak, but still gets the job done! I would recommend it for the price point"
1,unreliable,"Purchased the WP70W model two months ago. It is already nearlynon-functional. It appears to be leaking water from inside the handle therefore no water pressure at all. I have purchasedTeledyne Water Piks in the past and they didn't last very longeither. It had been a few years since I used this model, so Idecided to try them one more time. Big mistake. The Braun Oral-BMD-15 Oxyjet is your better bet."
4,Water Pik has been good for me over the years!,"I bought my first Water Pik in about 1970 at the recommendation of my dentist at that time. I think that I am on my 5th one now. I think that they have each lasted about 5 years on the average. Like others have mentioned, generally the hoses fail. In more recent years they have not allowed us to get hose parts and repair this ourselves. There have been years when I did not replace a failed Water Pik. However, I keep coming back to using Water Pik and am hooked on using it. I am especially dependant on Water Pik for a good cleaning of the few dental food pockets that I have. It has also helped me to have healthy gums."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this product since I have gum disease and need to floss. I always had trouble flossing and this product seemed to be a good solution.I read some of the reviews before buying this product on Amazon. The reviews were not necessarily glowing but okay. I should have paid more attention to the reviews since they are not wrong. The problems that I ran into are as follows...1) There is no switch to shut off the water stream without turning the system off. So if you move the spayer from your mouth, water will spray across the room. At the lowest setting the stream is strong...2) As other people have noticed, the WaterPik has a vibration problem. The WaterPik periodically starts vibrating and it makes use very difficult.Since my dentist is now recommending an oral irrigation system, I need to look at a different brand. I am now considering the portable Panasonic irrigator. It is not perfect, but I have a number of Panasonic products, at home, which I am happy with..."
2,dissapointing,The unit cannot be covered unless the tip is removed;so I don't do it. Looks like hell uncovered.The handle is too thick to easily revolve the tip when using in mouth.I'm comparing the new one to old 25 yr one and yes they don't build them like they used to
1,Piss-poor design,"I had always wanted to try a WaterPik. So I finally bought one here on Amazon. As soon as I had it assembled and ready to go, as per the instructions, it leaked everywhere! The unit never snapped on securely, no matter what I tried. I also disliked how the cord goes from underneath the unit instead of behind it. And the piece that you put into your mouth is where the OFF switch should be, rather than on the base unit.Good thing that Amazon and this vendor honored my return hassle-free."
3,Waterpik,The unit accomplished its purpose of cleaning between teeth.The problem was that it kept tripping the GFI outlet in my bath.Probably a random mfg problem. I do not know if this is a typical problem for these units.I know the outlet is good since I can ( and DO ) regularly plug in a vacuum sweeper that draws around 10 Amps.
3,Really quiet,The older models are much louder. It's a shame that I have to keep getting new units as they start to leak after a while.
1,GINGIVA GETS GUMMED,"Based on my experience in owning water picks over the past two decades, I would rank the WaterPik WP-60W as having the worst quality in my experience. Its lowest-power setting for the water stream is too low to be valuable. It has several power settings for the water stream. Any more forceful setting than the lowest setting is too strong, i.e., probably has the potential to damage gingiva. I have had this instrument for only one day, and I have tentatively decided to return it. The box says that it was made in China. I can only speculate that the designer and/or manufacturer intended it for a species with more durable gingiva than mine."
1,Undelivered purchase,I am still waiting to have news of my order for a Waterpik WP60W Teledyne Personal Oral Irrigator
3,Short-lived Power Monster,"This baby can blow out your back teeth. But it blew itself out after six weeks. The good news: the Pikheads were willing to replace it with a phone call. So if they keep replacing it, I'd give it five stars though it is noisy and I use it in my apt at three in the morning. A towel underneath dampens most of the ruckus."
4,Waterpik saved my gums!,"Ok...I hate to floss...........I was getting bad and worse reviews by my dentist..........pockets getting deeper, and warnings of expensive repairs ahead........dentist informed me he used Waterpik and his gums really responded.........Tried it.............INCREDIBLE improvement......a little messy with the water, but after a really good brushing, watching those impacted little food particles floating into the sink with the water spray keeps me using it......and no more worry about bleeding gums........so I use it about every other day!"
1,Motor gone in 4 weeks!,"This product, although poorly constructed, did a good job while it lasted! I bought this waterpik on March 9, 2005 and as of April 5, 2005 the motor is gone. What a rip off!"
1,Waterpik NOT Durable,"I have been buying as family gifts and using WP-60 higher end models of the WaterPik for the past 5 years - approximately 17 units. Every unit has been used habitually on the average of at least 3 times per week. Only one unit had lasted for almost 15 months before the handle and tubing began leaking resulting in hardly any water pressure at all. Every other unit failed in the exact same way lasting less than a year. All units cannot be repaired and have no replaceable parts reasonably available. Even on sale, this product is too expensive for an expected useful life of one year at a frequency of 3 uses per week. This product is very cheaply made in that it fails to return a reasonable value. Yesterday, my newest WP-60 tube and handle finally broke down exactly like its predecessors. I put this into use new only 8 months ago. I am now going to look for alternatives elsewhere.Be a smarter consumer than the marketers."
1,"don't waste money, buy a waterpik ultra","I owned one of these bottom of the line waterpiks some years ago and when my waterpik ultra failed (after a year or so of heavy use) bought another to save $30. Bad decision. The personal is noisy, ineffective, often does not deliver a stream of water. I threw it away and purchased another ultra even though I did not want to spend more money with this manufacturer. The ultra is quiet and the force of the water strem can be varied continuously."
3,Worked great for a two days!,"I had never used a waterpik before, but my dentist recommended one to me. The first time I used it I was surprised for two reasons. The first was how loud it was! The second was that I had never had a home cleaning that was so good. It was so great I didn't mind the fact that I needed ear plugs when it was turned on. Okay it's not quite that loud.Here are the things I didn't like. When gripping the nozzle I found myself accidentally disconnecting it because my fingers were too high. If I lowered my grip I would accidentally lower the pressure. Both things were easy enough to get around, but annoying.Then two days later it would only work at a low pressure which was both dissapointing as well as useless. Two days! Not that I was too surprised. When the motor is on it seems to pump violently.Well, I bought the WP-100. I've used it once, and love it so far. It's quiet, and the nozzle is easier to use.Pay the extra few bucks and get the WP-100."
2,Loved it the 2 months before it began leaking...becoming unusable,"Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet. Wow, can I tell you how improved my gums and mouth felt for about 2 months! But.... It was very short lived, as the tubing leading to the pic began leaking--then quickly lost all function. Sorry, but I cannot afford to buy multiple units. Also, it seems the motor is fine...what a waste! Not doing it!"
3,Not as powerful as previous models,Product weighs much less then my previous model and it is not nearly as powerful. I have to use the highest setting - previously I used the middle setting.
3,A useful supplement to flossing,"A very handy supplement to regular flossing, gets into the gum pockets but I am not sure it does the whole job between my teeth."
4,Been using for over 15 years,"My dental problems have been dramatically reduced since using the WaterPik. It takes some practice to use it without spraying the bathroom, but when you get used to it, it's easy. It does not replace flossing, but gets out stuff that flossing doesn't. Handle traps water inside which allows thing to grow in there. I drill a hole or two in the bottom of the handle so it can drain, and problem is solved. Rinse handle in hot water after use to keep sanitary. If you find it too noisy, fold a washcloth under it to reduce noise. Also, drying it after use keeps it cleaner (water spots). Just bought the fourth one; first one lasted longer than later ones. Highly recommend."
3,WaterPik WP-60W,Product works but not like it used to.Motor runs loud and the entire unit is considerably lighter than the older one I had.Made in China explains everything.But it works.
2,WP-60W vs. Ultra Water Flosser,The WP-60W is clumsy to use! The Water Flosser is much easier to use. The amount saved on the WP-60W over the Water Flosser is not worth the difference in quality of operation. ALWAYS BUY THE WATER FLOSSER!!
2,Pain in the you-know-what...,"This is my third Waterpik oral irrigation system. The first two lasted at least 3 years. This one is a piece of you-know-what. First, the resevoir does not fit over the unit with the irrigator tool in place after use. Second, I have to fiddle with the resevoir several times before the water will travel through the irrigator tip properly...pain in the you-know-what. Third, it seems to need flushing with bleach and water to rid it of a musty smell in the irrigator tip. Once I get the blasted thing to work, it does a wonderful job of getting debris left after flossing, but it's still a pain in the you-know-what knowing that there are better models available."
1,Water pik WP- 60W failures,I bought a WP-60W less than one year ago and the pump has already failed. It never did work well. It pumped intermittently with very low pressure or not at all. It is a cheesy contraption at best in my opinion. Previously I had a WP-32W. It had 2 Pik Pocket Jet Tips 2 reservoirs Lg. & Sm. and it lasted 10 years. Teledyne has stopped making this one. Go figure !!I am looking for an alternative obviously.
4,A GOOD DENTAL HEALTH AID,The WaterPik dental health aid product I purchased replaced one I've used for a number of years. I bought this brand because I was very well satisfied and comfortable using the my previous unit.
3,"Lousy design, great results.","This is perhaps my 5th Waterpik. Eventually they die or start leaking in odd places, turning your bathroom into a rainforest. Why do I keep coming back? THEY WORK! I get compliments from my dentist and my dental hygienist. Better than flossing. Keeps those gums healthy. It's bulky, it tips, and I love it."
4,Quit Carping!,"I don't know about you, but my dentist charges $35 a minute for his fillings. For the same price, you will get two years from a device which, no matter how hard you brush, will kick surprising amounts of crud from between your teeth, can be filled with mouthwash to kill halitosis sources from between your teeth, virtually stops gum bleeding (me) with use 3x a week, and (bonus) can clean industrial parts quite well! Sure, its 89 decibals, vibrates like a banshee and squirts all over the bathroom (until you become expert), but let's not quibble! There is no substitute."
1,don't do it!,"Ok, I'm an idiot. My 3rd Water Pik has given up the ghost after 2 months. The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle. The latest one leaks water and so it's obviously an electrical hazard."
4,"It's Great, But----","I'm on my 3'rd water pick. I love it, but each one I've owned had to be replaced because the little tubing ends up breaking and seemingly can't be repaired."
1,Bad spelled with two bad's,"I didn't believe all the bad reviews having used WaterPiK for over 20 years so I went ahead and bought one anyway, what a disappointment. Within a week it started to stutter and lost water pressure now two months later almost all the pressure is gone. I could have saved some money had I just disregarded all those glowing reviews from questionable sources. I am not sure just what we old time WaterPiK users are to do. Anyone know of a product that works? Please email me if you do."
4,So far a very Good Product,"I've had my Waterpik about a week. I bought it to use with the Waterpik Gentle Sinus Rinse attachment. And it Works very well and does not leak, and the motor sounds as expected.Only improvement is to make the motor run well at its lowest setting as it does with it mid to high settings. The Lowest setting seem to strain the motor, so i just avoid that setting.Overall this is a very good product."
1,Different Voltage,"Unfortunately the product acquisted wasn't compatible with my country voltage. Altough it's the same voltage, the electric components doesn't work properly here. Therefor, the product is unusable. Be aware if you are a foreigner."
4,Good Gums,"I used water pik as a teen with braces, then stopped using it for a long time and my dental health suffered greatly. I had lots of cavities and one root canal. Finally I started using the waterpik again a few years ago and my gums and teeth are in great shape now! Of course, I quit drinking soda a long time ago and stopped eating sugar, but, I have been getting good results from this and never use regular floss. I use it with warm to hot water three or four times a day and I think it's easy and effective. I bought the cordless one for my kids because they have braces and it has really made a huge difference in their dental health. My younger son had repeated tooth abscesses and had three teeth pulled way before their time. Also, he was ineffective at brushing. Now, he has not had any cavities and is getting A's on oral hygiene at the orthodontist. My husband refuses to use it because he says it is to much trouble, but to me it is way easier and way more effective than regular floss."
3,WaterPik WP-60W Dental Water Jet System,Bought this to replace older model that had broken hose. Not as easy to attach tip as old one and have to remove tip to invert reservoir when not using the system. Hose needs to be longer.
3,"Accurate, but outdated","My 3 year old grandson loves firetrucks and was enthralled with the video,but what we adults noticed was how very outdated it is...must have been produced in the 80's!! I would suggest that it be updated or lower the price."
5,The last one was great and so is this,"I read Kelly Harte's last book and thought it the best of all the RDI novels I'd read so far. I didn't expect this one to live up to Guilty Feet, but hey, the author's done it again. I loved it. It's a real caper involving a very intelligent parrot, sorry - African Grey! - and a host of interesting characters. The main one being Tao, who gets to live in a beautiful house because she discovers she has a way with exotic birds. It's laugh out loud funny in parts and I'm already looking forward to the next one!"
4,"Funny, cute, entertaining","Personally, I'm confused by the other reviews of this book - including those who like it! So let me tell you what I think - Kelly Harte writes a likeable, funny, fast-paced novel that you can spend a summer's day reading (or a winter's night). Nothing deep here - but it's fun. I don't find the main character unlikeable at all (as one reviewer notes) - she's not sickly sweet, but goodness who is? Sure, the plot is far-fetched, but I don't read books like this to stay rooted in reality. Overall, it was a very entertaining tale, and I'd certainly recommend it."
2,Not very entertaining,"Tao Tandy & the love interest get off -surprise!- to a bad start, but it's forced & lame. There's no chemistry between them, no tension, no romance. The storyline with the American chef fizzles out, goes nowhere. So we have to rely on the criminal aspect of the book, which is too small to carry the book. So all we have left is the amusing parrot (sorry -- ""African Grey"") and the neurotic mother. Too many elements, nothing well-developed. Ultimately I was left unsatisfied with the hero & heroine and the overall story."
4,Everything I expected,My bunny chewed through the wire for my old keyboard. This works great & the price was right.
2,No Relief for Me,"I thought this might really do the trick in keeping my SI joint where it is supposed to be and thereby reducing my pain. Unfortunately, it didn't get the job done. I thought it might have done some good in the beginning, but recently cast it aside because the Velcro would hurt my skin."
4,"Didn't help my back pain, but it's made very well.","I was actually very surprised with how well made this belt is. It's easy to put on, and it doesn't move around and get out of place either. However, it didn't help with my lower back pain. I've got a bad disc in my lower back and a torn ligament in my SI joint. I've also tried another back belt and it didn't help either.Nevertheless, this Serola Sacroiliac belt is a very well made product and I would recommend at least giving it a try if you have lower back pain. The only product that has really helped relieve some of my pain while sitting is the Back JoyBackJoy Core BlackIt really seems to help take the pressure off while in the car."
3,Didn't help much but.......,I bought this belt for my wife who has terrible back pain. She doesn't get any relief wearing it when she is inactive such as reading/watching TV or engaged in mild activity such as preparing dinner or light housework. But she gets some mild relief (20%) when she is more active such as puttering with her flower garden for a longer period of time. This item was highly recommended by her physical therapist who also has a very bad back and gets a lot of relief when wearing this belt. The therapist said it improved her life substantially. The belt is not that expensive so I would try it. You won't know if it works until you wear it. Everyone is different so you just can't assume if it doesn't work for one person it won't work for you. Good luck.
4,Back belt,Glad I bought it. Works like it should. Was recommened to me by a friend who had one and help her tremendously. Family member had terrible back problems. She bought one and it helps her when the her back starts going out. Helps stop it in its tracks. Supports the back and keeps it from getting worse. I bought 2. One for husband and one for me. Glad I did. It works...it helps...It's my back's new best friend.
4,"doesn't slip, stay in place","It works pretty well in stabilizing my SI joint. However I'm a lean person and the belt creates bruises on my hip bones and sarcasm. My physical therapist recommends trying something with a padding on the SI joint, if I can't get used to the pressure."
2,not good,maybe it is me but i felt no diferent with it on. did not take the pain away. would not buy again.
3,help me move freer and sit longer,"I had an accident 3 months ago, have sacrum fractures on both side that not only limited my movement but also hurt a lot. This new Serola Sacroilliac belt helps me move freer and sit longer, but..the material makes my sensitive skin have redness around the belt area. Anyway,I still will recommend this product to any one who have sacrum problems. (I'm also enjoy the fast delivery.)"
3,"For me, this didn't help much.","For me, this product didn't help much. In the end, frequent hamstring and piriformis stretches were more effective.Your exact SI problem and solution may be different, so it may be worth a try."
2,Good to hold ice in place but other than that . . .,"Good to hold ice in place but other than that it is mostly a rip off of the older, larger back braces that have been around for decades that also are not useful in the long run. Stretching is the best thing you can do for SI Joints and lower back. If you cannot tolerate NSAIDS, all that is left is to buy an OTC Topical Analgesic Menthol product and spend a good deal of time messaging it in and I suspect the messaging itself does more good than the product."
5,WOW,"I had been having severe hip and groin pain for several weeks and have been going to physical therapy, but still hadn't been back to my usual activity level. My physical therapist recommended this belt, and I'm so glad she did! I can wear the belt under my scrubs at work and you can't tell i'm wearing it and it provides a lot of support and really helps decrease the pain.the only bad thing i can say about it, and it's unavoidable seeing as what it does, but it gives even the skinniest person a muffin top. it's a fine trade off for how well it reduces the pain, but it is worth noting. also if i'm planning to wear it for several hours, i'll wear it over an additional layer of clothing to prevent any skin irritation.the product was shipped on time and everything, i was happy for that. i don't go anywhere without it! strongly recommend it for anyone who suffers from hip/groin/etc pain"
5,Works as described,Brought this for my wife who is having back pain after pregnancy. This was recommended by her physio therapist. She feels very comfortable wearing this and it minimizes her pain while working. A very good buy.
4,Very good option,"It gives me excellent support to my lower back. Helps minimize the pain, it's like it keeps me together. Comfortable and flexible. The only bad thing is that I didn't know I was allergic to certain rubbers and it caused me a lot of itching during the first two weeks. I solved it wearing it not directly to the skin, but wearing a long tank top first. It arrived before expected and the price is very convenient vs others in the market. Its a keeper."
3,Helped a little,This belt got me through the rough stages when my back went out. The problem is that the belt is bulky and not very comfortable to wear. It did what it was supposed to do and kept my hips supported. I used this belt for about a week.
3,e5simon2,"I read ""Moonlight, Wine and Stakes"" and really liked the book. That is why I purchased ""Only For This Time"". I was disappointed with this story. The female lead is supposed to be a strong character, but every time the going gets rough, she gives up and walks away. The book never explains why Nic feels he doesn't have the right to a personal life. Towards the end of the book, it gets confusing. It implies that other characters are messing with the time line; however, it doesn't explain how they get access to it. Only Nic is supposed to be able to get into the room it is kept in. The ending was a let down. Yes, the main characters seem to end up together; however, it is all wrapped up on the last page and you are left hanging on how other characters were involved and why. If Nic has always been Time, why does Lucien think he can take over? It doesn't make any sense. Three stars was probably higher than I should have scored it."
3,Good for plunking,It is good for plunking it has a tendency to not hold gun up it clasps under the weight of the gun if used for hunting it would have to keep adjusting stick
2,not strong enough,"the shootin stick was light and handy, but not strong enough. i thought it only natural to also use it for a walking aid, but it broke on the 2nd trip."
1,Too superficial,"I picked this book up a couple of years ago and when I read it then, I thought it was too unreal, too fictitious. Everything the author wrote about Oracle was that Oracle is the paradise and there is not a thing wrong about Oracle.I read it again a month back and thinking it would changed my mind. It didn't. In fact, it made it even worse. I have been with several high profile Silicon Valley tech companies and despite the rosy outlook of these companies (especially during the dot-com days), it was not all heaven. The author failed miserably to inject realism into Oracle machinery. I would definitely give this book a thumbs down."
2,Oracle Edge by Stuart Read,"i was expecting to get some hard facts about oracle, but this book seems like a fairy tale. Everything about Oracle is glorious here, infact at times I had a strong urge to joing Oracle, while reading the book. The book is well written but would have proved helpful to people if it mentioned the struggle at Oracle and the real life history of the employees in general. overall an easy to read book."
4,"Love the music, but why only one song?","I have been to the festival many times and considering how many bands there are and how long each of them play, it like a mini-concert by each artist. So why not put more songs out? There were sooo many good songs that where played live and yet not all of them made it to the DVD. Forget the 2 disc set, what ever happen to the 10 or 12 disc box set like the Live Aid DVD or the compilation of Bob Dylan? Even Ericka Clement Robson who is dead has a box set out. Come one, no love for us country loving folks? Figures considering some marketing machine, literally, in New York decided what songs should be allowed. How about being brave and getting some real songs out there in the mix. I don't think anyone wants the junk that Madison Ave deems PC. Come on Austin people, we are progressive, not like some so and so's we know. More songs for next year and more artist that are local, please."
4,Good,Shoes are exactly as they look in the picture. One hint: buy in 0.5 size bigger than you need. Thanks Amazon.com!
5,"Cute, but small","I am so sad! I ordered these shoes and they are absolutely adorable. They are everything I could ever want in a skimmer. Unfortunately, I ordered a 9 (my shoe size ranges from 8.5-9, averaging around 9) and they are most definitely a size too small.They don't have a 9.5, let alone a 10 in a color I like for the same bargain.This is truly heart-breaking."
1,ugh.,"I should have returned these shoes. Ugh. poor sole quality, no cushioning at all, very narrow as described but finish poor, the surface finish peeled at the sole shoe sidewall seam. Mia normally a good brand these shoes were not a good example of that."
3,Not a bad dish set,"The firing and glazing of the product is not consistent or the best quality. I also would say it looks better online than in person. But, this is not top of the line elegant dinnerware. This is middle of the line casual dinnerware, and as such looks pretty good. You get a lot for the price, and it is a nice set...just be sure to get the sale price to get the best deal."
1,Broken in pieces,"WARNING!!Don't buy this dinnerware because it will not come in one piece! I received the box, didn't even care to open it because it has a tear which clearly shows the plates were broken into pieces.When I moved the box I heard the jingle of the dishes a clear sign that they were just a mess.Poor packaging to start with, they didn't even have bubble wrap to cushion the item. I am very disappointed."
2,Not a bad dish set,"I was a Little Shocked when it arrived the box was smashed half the set was cracked, i called up amazon the said not a problem will send you another one and just throw out the broken one so now i have 1 half sets for the price of one (speaking about price it was only 30 dollars)"
1,Dinnerware Set is lovely but Amazon's shipping stinks!!,"Should have listened to all the reviews...My dishes arrived at least half shattered.One would think Amazon would get tired of refunding and start packaging properly. It really is a shame since the couple of dishes that arrived in one piece were lovely. The funny thing is I have received unbreakable items from Amazon with way more packaging and cushion then this very fragile, breakable set had.Such a shame!"
5,"Perfect, once you......","The dishes are beautiful. They are modern, but very classic.They are simple,yet elegant when placed on the table. I have used them since the Holidays and have gotten many positive remarks.Because of the classic white look, they complement all styles of table settings and accessories.The most difficult thing about getting these dishes was to get them ALL in one piece delivered. The packing was lousy. Several dishes were broken, which I requested to be replaced. But, policy prevented me from sending back only the broken ones. The entire shipment weighed more than 60 lbs. which, in my opinion, should not have been shipped back and forth. It was very costly in frt. charges for Amazon."
3,pltaes,"ALthough the dishes came 90% broken, the return was easy. It is for that reason I shop Amazon"
2,Deficient Pieces make assembling impossible...,"Mission Futon Frame - w/7"" Quality Futon Mattress - FullThe Room Doctor Futon came on time and ahead of schedule but the Back Panel Pieces were deficient and made the assembly of the product difficult. The Back Slats of the Back Panel were shorter than needed for the structure. All I can do now is sit on the futon. I am currently awaiting a response from a customer service representative regarding this matter."
4,"hard to assemble, very sturdy","so I have had this item for a while now and it lives in a home with a toddler, a mostly mobile baby and a husband...It sees hell and its working just fine and showing no signs of coming apart. My only complaint about this item is that the holes did not line up on the very top piece (with the slats)If we had not had a power drill to more or less force a connection, this piece would have only been connected by two holes. No matter which way we tried it, the top bit didnt fit anywhere else and only 2/3 holes matched up. I made a little diagram, hope that helps.=o==o==o-o--o--o-"
4,Old Pentagle fan gets rid of scratches,"When I recently had an urge to listen to Pentangle, I discovered that two (yes two) of my old Pentangle albums had gone missing (and maybe had been for years).This selection appears to be pretty close to what I would have chosen myself (usually there's one favourite mssing). So if you're familar with the music it's nice to supplement those ancient albums with a CD and if you're not, this is pretty much all you need."
4,Cake pan,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas this year. She had be quite upset with me because i lost her old one...opps. Anyway I got the pan and is a rather thin metal, but for 7 bucks....i think its fair. I haven't given it to her yet so we have not gotten to try it out, but i think it will do just fine."
1,Cheap,"Good price for four pans, but cheaply made. Thin aluminum, rolled edges are not fully rolled and have sharp edges which will cut fingers, if not careful. Returning the ones I ordered. Ace Hardware also has a restocking charge for returns. Overall, pass on this one and spend the money on quality pans."
1,Don't order this pan,"I ordered this pan for my daughter and she received a MIRRO brand pan instead. After 2 months of use she calls me to let me know that the pan has small holes in it. I could not believe that T-fal would have a defective pan. I asked her to check the brand and that is when I found out that they had sent her a MIRRO brand. Don't order, you might get taken too."
3,OK,It was so dinged and dented that I had to set it flat on the floor and step in it to flatten it out - the lid was the same way.
3,Like the product but what I received is not T-Fal brand,"I like the covered cake pans because I have been searching for a set with metal covers. They were advertised as T-Fal brand. However, what I received were not T-Fal, they were Foley brand. It still is a good product, but not brand-name and probably overpriced."
2,Poor Quality,"How did T-Fal even allow their name to be placed on this flimsy pan? It does not even measure a true 9X13 pan. I do like the idea of being able to use both the pan and the lid as a cooking sheet, that is very creative."
2,Disappointed,"I received my ""MIRRO"" pan this morning... it is very flimsy... the edges of the lid are rough and it looks like I will have to be very careful to avoid cutting myself when handling it... for half the price it would be barely acceptable, but $13.00 is definitely steep for this item... I don't recommend this baking pan..."
1,Mislead,I am giving pan as a gift so I haven't removed the plastic seal. What I ordered was described as a T-Fal aluminum cake pan. This pan is a Mirro which usually is of lower quality and price. The pan may be fine but I do not like being deceived.
3,"Not practical, but fun","While the ability to write in latin is not practal, it is fun and useful. By teaching latin composition, this book inadvertantly improves ones ability to read latin. By using the constructions in this book it becomes easier to recognize them in context. Ex libris, sapientia."
5,what a wonderful treat!!!,"i rarely have such a wonderful time like watching this great film. it almost included any possible ingredient that a movie could be rendered, a thrilling and joyful ride along with the wonderful scenario. akira kurosawa did it again this time with his ingenious adaptation from a novel. you have to admit that kurosawa indeed was a genius, he was destined to be a great artist, like mozart, beethovan, lizt, chopin, tolstoy....those great composers, writers, painters, sculptors...brought the most wonderful things to human civilization. this 'alley cat' film indeed is a great viewing experience.i've read some people highly praised 'when the last sword is drawn', but that movie was flawed, not as perfect as this 'dora-heita', furthermore, the actor who played this heita role was absolutely far better.please do not overlook this great film, get it at any cost."
4,Very good period Japanese swordfight movie with interesting plot.,"I found this movie easy to follow. The acting and sets were credible. It reminds one of the Western movie cliche of ""the lone stranger rides into town, tears the place up and all wrongs are righted as he rides off into the dust."" Good to see Kyoko Kishida (Women in the Dunes) in a cameo shot later in her life. An enjoyable flick."
2,Leg hoof paint brush for horses,I would prefer a longer handle and stiffer bristles. I thought for the price it would be much more than it is.
1,recording device,"Received in good shape and in the time stated.I tried the device using Sony digital recording recorder. My voice came through loud and clear,however the receiving voice was so faint as to be barely audible.I will be trying it on another recorder to see if that will make a difference.The device sets up very quickly and is easy to use, as to the quality I'm going to have to reservemy final opinion until after I've tried the device with another recorder."
1,Avoid!,This product is complete garbage. It does not work with standard telephone cable for digital phones such as V-Tech. The hole on the adapter for the phone cable is much to small to accept it. Complete waste of money. Save yours!
1,got mine to day and tryed my luck ?,"tryed with all my heart and it just don,t work on any thing i have and 5 new old type phones wall mount to a new out of the box 1954 black heavy heavy phone and 2 type that are counter top and all work well the phones that is and i have to walk about hones that cost me 200 dollors and i know it won,t work on that type .i like phones and like to record the talks i have with my mother and 2 kids .it would be sweet if it worked and had a old one that did .but it was stipped on and went by by . with one come to open and no info inside and looked uesed and had figer prints on it ! so i can,t till ya how good they are but sharen what happen to me for you will be awear about this site ! from me wess."
5,This book is a must-own for any Stooge fan,"My brother and I grew up watching and imitating the Stooges 'cause they were the best sibling role models ever (y'know, when they stuck together, they beat Nazis and gangsters and when they fought each other they looked like, well, stooges). After totally digging this guide, I gave him a copy as a Hanukkah gift. He's driving his wife nuts with his constant reading aloud from it. It's amazingly comprehensive and written with the love of a true fan. Larry, Curly, Moe, and especially Shemp, deserved this book! I can't watch their shorts without this encyclopedia at my side."
5,The best Stooges book since....since forever!!!!!!,"As a novice Stooge fan I didn't know what to expect. I was blown away. I always thought ""Mashed potato muscles"" was a term of endearment meant only for me. Now knowing that Moe Howard made it up I'm proud! Excellent book Mr.Kurson."
1,What a major disappointment!,"When Comedy III acquired the official rights to the Three Stooges name, lots of low quality items started flooding the market. The Three Stooges Encyclopedia is a continuation of this low quality trend. The book is difficult to use, and really tells very little about the famous comedy team. Instead of being a reference book to the Stooges, it clutters its pages with worthless items like obscure quotes from the shorts. You want to see a good encyclopedia about a classic comedy team? Flip through the Marx Brothers Encyclopedia. This one isn't worth your time."
1,Disappointment,Disappointing Stooges book wastes too much time on what lines they used in movies and not enough time on the Stooges. Best part of book is the section dealing with the supporting players in the Stooges shorts.
4,Beautiful piece,This was more than a picture could do it justice. Very true blue color with lots of detail.
2,not as described,"I have the previous Zeus tent the EXO. I like it's ease of use and the spaciousness. It is somewhat difficult to enter and condensation is sometimes a problem. So, when the revised Zeus, the 2LE was introduced it interested me. Eureka states that there is more useable space without adding extra weight. That sold me, and the new tent arrived today. The box states that the minimum weight is 3 pounds 10 ounces, which is exactly what the Zeus EXO said. But no, the real minimum weight for the 2LE measures 4 pounds 1.4 ounces. In the day of lightening backpack loads, 7.4 ounces is just too much to lie about. If it really was 3-10, it would be a good light weight purchase. At 4-1.4 it is now with many other tents that outperform the Zeus. If Eureka would have told the truth, they would have a dedicated customer. Now that they blatently lied to me, I will take my business elsewhere."
3,Nice Map,Buy your maps in the USA if you are at all cost conscious.This map gave up the ghost after a total of 90 + days in Sicily over six years. It's replacement bought in Sicily was 4x the price and probably not as good of a map.
4,This album is an adrenaline rush,"I love driving to this Cd. I would recommend this Cd to anyone into Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, or stuff along that line."
5,Gaba Elmex Toothpaste,"On my last trip to Germany Customes took my toothpaste away from me when i borded the plane, so i needed tootpaste when i arrived in MunichMy cousin introduced me to this toothpaste with i brought back with me, but this time in my suitecase i really like the taste and the smoothness on my teethand it also the fresh breath.Gaba Elmex Toothpaste without Menthol"
2,outdated book.,"outdated book. If you are new to Oralce dba, you can pick some unix scripts. Otherwise this book is out dated and covers 9i."
2,Good but not nough,the book is great but it is quite old that i dowsn't consist of theetire new technology between linux and oracle database.
5,Like Cake met John Spencer at a They Might Be Giants Concert,"The headline says it all. If you like any of those three bands, or some other related artists, you will love this CD. In this one CD, you get: dry vocals and the occasional yodel; dirty, half-folk half-country half-rock guitar and bass riffs; pounding drums; that pure, comforting lo-fi feel; an earful of clever lyrics; and a love song to a librarian. It's so beautiful I am going to turn off my computer and listen to it now."
2,Cute but easily broken,"We bought the red Alessi timer because it would have been a perfect fit for our kitchen. But, we had trouble getting it to work right and we're pretty sure that we broke it while messing with it. We're really not rough people; it just seems that the timer is much too easy to break. (Note: We learned that this timer must be turned all the way to 60 and then back to the time you want. The instructions don't say that. The timer still didn't work for us, but we think it was already broken by the time we learned about that.)"
2,Dissapointing ...,"I bought this book simply on R.K.Laxman's reputation. The ""Stories"" section in this book is worthless in my opinion and is simply a waste of time. His stories almost end abrubtly and give you a feeling as if the author fooled you into wasting your time reading it.The Travelogues and Sketches are not that bad. It does contain some funny one-two-liners of legendary Laxman wit. But to understand it you need to be well versed with the Indian psyche of looking at things.Overall, I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone. I should have stuck to his ""Who Said It"" in Times Of India."
1,I used to hate this sorry game!,"Don't get me wrong...I absolutley LOVED the Sega CD.I thought it was the coolest thing ever at the time.There were also some really good FMV games out there for it too.Which alot of people hated...but I loved.Anyway.Sewer Shark was NOT one of those games that I enjoyed.This game totally sucked.And it was SO f-ing hard too.I couldn't even get passed the first level....or whatever it was.I would always crash EVERY...SINGLE...F-ING...TIME! No matter how hard I tried to avoid it.Ugh! This game was such a headache.Fortunatly,I didin't pay anything for it,because that was the game that came with the Sega CD console.I only wish they would have included a game that was actually PLAYABLE! Would have been bad ass if Sonic CD was the game that was included instead.By the way...The guy who plays in this game,is the same dude who does the voice for Solid Snake."
3,The plastic is okay,"I love the Time pedals and have been using them for years. I preferred the old-style cleats without the extra plastic to make for easier walking, especially since the forward cleat was metal. In this version, the forward cleat is plastic, and since my old cleats had worn quite a bit on the front, I'd gotten use to a looser connection for easier clipping in or out. It's going to be awhile before my new cleats wear a little bit and make it easier to clip out.These cleats come with a spacer to help fit them to my Time shoes, which are the most comfortable cycling shoes i've ever had."
4,"Too Good To Be True, But We Can Wish","This is a great fantasy/romance novel. You know that it will never happen to you (or to anybody), but it sure sounds good. It is really easy to get swept up in the passion and romance of the book, but coming back to reality is a real drag! I recommend it for those hopeless romantics who want to be reminded of why they are so hopeless and for those who aren't romantic at heart but want to be. It's easy reading and will take your mind off of your problems and deep into Janelle Taylor's world. Just remember, you have to come back..."
3,This book is great,"I read the book in one sit down and recomend it to all norse mythology enthusiasts. i really liked its comprehensive ans semi-reader friendly view on norse mythology. i give it one thumb up beacuse of all the things it covers and its one of the only norse mythology books that gave me a crucial fact, that i'll let the reader discover for him/herself"
4,Pinta tu aldea y serás universal,"El insigne escritor ruso Fiodor Dostoievski alguna vez dijo ""pinta tu aldea y serás universal"". Y que mejor que esta frase para sintetizar este tarot. Este deck está basado en la mitología de los antiguos vikingos y sorprende sus analogías con el simbolismo tradicional de los arcanos. Las imágenes son sugestivas pero algunos arcanos mayores son demasiado despojados, coartando un poco a la interpretación. El clima logrado en cada carta invita a investigar la religión asatrúar."
2,I think it could have been much better!,"The reason I beleive that is because, Lisa was being a total disappiontment! I mean who in their right mind, would let their friends down like that?!? She was totally blocking out the fact that they were really hurt about her column!!! And I also think Carole could've been a little easier on Stevie about the little game thing she played withSampson! I say this because I've trained all of my own horses, and sometimes they'll mind better if you take a minute or two to play aroud with them! Then again Stevie did play around too much. Also I think it was a real treat with Trudy in the story, I especially liked the little Topside inncident!!!"
2,"Long on Lists, Short on Help","""Beyond Shannon and Sean"" offers parents lists of Irish names not alphabetically but by category: Irish family names, saints' names, even names from James Joyce books. The names are all CAPITALIZED in long list, which is distracting.As other folks have indicated, there is little clue in pronunciation. Okay, so AOIDHGHEAN is an Irish saint's name. But male or female? The saint of what? And how in the world does one pronounce it? Not very helpful for the expecting parents looking for a name."
2,There was not enough assistance in pronunciation and meaning,"My wife and I enjoyed the book but found it to be extremely deficient in providing pronunciation and also in defining the meaning of each name. The book also seemed a bit disjointed. It did not follow well from one section to the next, with the same name often appearing in multiple sections."
3,"Fair, depending on your purpose","This text offers a selection of Irish names, but does so in an eclectic and whimsical method, rather than in a clearly organized manner. Some sections have fictitious names, listed just for humour. On the other hand, some context is offerred in order for the reader to learn of Irish cultural context of names. Some sections include Irish Saints' Names, Irish Place Names, etc.The largest drawback, in my opinion, is the deficiency in pronunciation assistance. Although the authors do provide some pronunciations, they do so only sporadically, and even then, often their provided glosses either confuse or contradict other sources. With truly Gaelic names and a readership unfamiliar with these names, more careful glossing is a strong need."
2,Not Impressed,"I had a very hard time reading this book, it just did not keep my interest. I have read other books by Black Lace that have made it very hard for me to stop reading, and this just was not one of them. The eroticism was lacking and the sudden closing (death) was so ackward. I did not enjoy this book at all."
4,Read this book before you scan,"When performing vulnerability assessments, a mistake many people make is that they will use simply run some software tools, without taking a big picture look at things.Such a haphazard approach will not be effective for large enterprise networks. With that, Managing A Network Vulnerability Assessment, gives the reader a all-inclusive framework for running a network vulnerability assessment.The book goes over issues such as scooping, assessment and scanning methodologies, reports, etc.The main part of the book is quickly readable at 187 pages.Appendix A is an ISO 17799 self -assessment checklist, which can be used to validate a system to an external reference. There are a few other checklists.Before anyone blindly runs a network scanner, they should read this book first to ensure that their scanning is done effectively and productively."
2,Doesn't work like the picture,"Well, I should of gone with my gut before I bought this. I thought this was a good idea that I could charge my Archos 705(704 uses most of the same stuff) in the car. Then I wondered if it came with the right tip and if I could charge it and use it at the same time. Well I was disappointed when I got it. It was plainly packed with no instructions or anything. It did come with a tip, but like what I was thinking, it was not the one that plugs into the side where you charge it (as the picture shows). Instead it was a regular looking cell phone tip. I did try it though and it works if you plug it into DVR Station plug. You can not use your device then though, because it thinks it's connected to a computer. I looked at their website and they don't even sell seperate tips. Oh well, at least it seems to charge. This is a very misleading product listing."
4,"Five stars for convert, but..","Let's checK:a. Concert: amazing. The best AC/DC video ever. In this concert, you can actually see the guysplaying, contrary to the annoying habit of bliding afst editing of recent realeases like RIVER PLATER, where you can'' t even see what's ging on, so fast the takes change from second to second.b. Package: very nice metal box, everything cool.c. Extras: the cards are ok. The pick also. The little book about the concert is well written. The really weak spot are the interviews, a bunch of guys (including awful Susan Masino) saying how great, magic, stupendous, marvellous, geniuses, beatutiful, breathtaking, everybody in AC/DC is.d. And, of course, you will not get a single special new interview made for this product by AC/DC themselves. (maybe due to Sony/Warner rights)."
4,Something about DVD thing,Ya know what could help? making a DVD!!!!!!! well another thing you could do is buy this video and then burn a dvd. but i would just wait cuz the actual dvd would be better
4,The 3 B's,"Bourbon, Beer, & Bon. Buy It!Let There Be ROCK! fantastic footage but the sound quality is not there. Who cares.Its classic AC/DC."
5,Ain't noise pollution - & that's what I <3,"For me this was hell of a trip.The old movie, wasn't that great (I was really disappointed on the quality). The quality is highly improved, especielly on the video quality: on the old one it was sloopy, it was dark, it was in low pixel, but now it has changed a lot. The colors from the spotlights are far better than before you can't really not compare it to the old one.If you thought there would be new camara spots or a lot new material, then you'll properly get disapoint if you buy this. Yes there are some bonus material, but it's mostly photos & some rocker fellows talking 'bout the band.For me the whole watching experience talks for it self and to watch this movie in High Definition [HD] is far better than watching it in low sloopy quality.The sound is also improved, but not far as much as the video quality.Conclusion the movie talks for it self & if you really want a better experience, than buy the new one in HD & see what modern technology can do."
1,ac/dc,Set was incomplete. The photos were missing. Was ordered for a friend. Both him and I were very disappointed. Too bad he decided not to return it.
3,good,"The video is good,but the sound quality is very poor.It's got the greats:Highway...,Live Wire,and others.The bottom line is: good choice of songs, bad sound quality!!"
4,WONDERFUL,"THe only trouble is that the lights on the stage are very dark, you cannot even see the faces of Malcolm, Cliff and Phil sometimes. Anyway, a great rock show. The interviews are weak, the band seem to be sleeping."
3,pen lite doesn't work -got a replacement - Happy Now,Bought these for Christmas presents and was disappointed to see that one pen light didn't work even after changing batteries.Update- returned set and received a replacement- rate theproduct set 5 stars now- good quality and value- seller standsbehind merchandise.
2,Was hoping for a little more....,"This movie starts out promising. It has a nice house and some interesting characters. It seemed to be shot and edited well. The plot starts out good enough. However, by the end of the movie the characters are trying to hard. They are yelling and emotional but not for reasonable cause. You have to have some realistic scenarios to capture your audience and draw them in. It seemed like the writing fell apart towards the end. The characters were interesting enough but it's like the writers just quit trying towards the end of the movie."
3,Not for sensitive skin,"I'm all about natural products, but something about citric acid doesn't agree with my sensitive skin. Or maybe product isn't PH balanced. Either way, if you have sensitive, dry to normal skin, I would suggest using a different product. I couldn't wash my face every day with this, but rather every two days, only using water and moisturizing in between. It was too harsh for me to use everyday."
4,Good,"I like this, but when I makeup on my face, it is not easy to remove it completely, so I am usually using it in the morning."
2,Displeased,"This product did not work in my machine. I did not like how it was packed; there was know anti-static bags used; it was just put into a box that had a light bulb in it. And I believe when you ship CPU's they need more attention than just a cardboard box. They are very touchy, especially with static electricity as with most computer products. Enough said."
2,"small, easily breakable","They look so cute, and I thought they would be great for my little animal lovers... but they are so poorly made. The first one cracked within a couple days, and the rest are now ""on display"" and not used. If a toddler stepped on one it would break... they are not at all sturdy enough for kids to handle. They are also smaller than I expected... much smaller!"
2,awful translation,"These are sometimes portentous and ponderous translations of Rilke's quixotic poems: not generally inaccurate, but leaden and often incomprehensible in English, weighed down by the decision to rhyme (even though Barnstone does not always follow Rilke's actual rhyme schemes). Just one example: in sonnet XVI, Rilke's final line is ""Hier. Das ist Esau in seinem Fell"". ""Fell"" rhymes with ""schnell"", which Barnstone translates, unexceptionably, as ""fast""; but then the final line becomes ""Here/is Esau in his belt and fated caste""- which is unclear, pompous, and a mess. The Unicorn sonnet, 2. IV, sounds flat and odd. Leishman's translation is incomparably better, maybe because Leishman saw himself as giving a a discreet crib, not as making, in Barnstone's claim, ""the literal literary"". Barnstone is often a fine translator. Here he falls into the bizarrely pedestrian. If you're looking for a good literary translation of the Sonnets to Orpheus, keep looking."
2,Informative but dull,"I have to agree with another reviewer that the presentation of the material is pretty dull. Large swaths of this book read like a recitation of facts or a timeline written out in prose form. I don't usually read history books, but was inspired after reading Kissinger's ""On China"" to read more about the history of other countries in the region. Unfortunately, the human interest elements and occasional touches of humor that made Kissinger's book an engaging read are largely absent from this title. I'm sure that the book is am impressive work of scholarship for students and scholars of history alike. However, an educational text doesn't have to be dry to be informative. I would say that a layperson who is interested in reading a history that is both educational and entertaining may wish to look elsewhere."
3,"decent, but a bit dull","the book prevents the basic facts, but lacks analytical depth. a good intro nonetheless for beginners. for a more detailed approach, check out ""The Generalissimo's Son"" though that book as well is not too engaging theoretically or analytically."
5,Extraordinaire,"I have 2 friends (who like progressive, fusion and jazz) who purchased this cd and did NOT like it. I don't know but if you like unusual time signatures and like instrumental music with super tight arrangements AND compositions in the melodic and harmonic side of the spectrum, than you GOT to love these guys! I know i do! Mahavishnu, Zappa, Magma, Jan Hammer and Albert Marcoeur came to mind while playing these great tracks! If these mentioned artist are welcomed in your cd collection then Thanks For Flying with Us is a safe bet!"
5,MARVELOUS!,"What a ride! This is an album that MUST NOT be overlooked. Mats/Morgan Band explore space! Great band, great album. Buy it!!!"
3,Still infested with ground squirrels,The company was great...seamless transaction and speedy shipping.The product did not meet my expectations. I covered my flower beds with this spray and the ground squirrels didn't bat an eye.
5,A student of Dr. Russell who loves the book as much as class,"OK. after one year of Latin taught by Dr. Russel, her mantra whenever we didn't understand something was to ""look in the book"". Ya know what, it worked. She spent summers upon summers working on that text, and the polish and plainness of the wording in the textbook really shows. It is very easy to learn out of a book that tells you exactly what you need to know, and nothing extra, even when it explains every concept descriptively enough so you understand it. Though in one year of 8th Grade Latin I've only finished the first 6 chapters, I am confident that the last six will be just as enjoyable as the first."
3,The inventory bar code label goo wouldn't come off!!!,"The ladle is fine, just a simple acrylic ladle for serving my Christmas party punch. My problem was that I couldn't get the goo from the inventory label to come off. Very frustrating. Finally got it off with a product called Goo Gone. So you might want to order some Goo Gone with your ladle."
1,do not order this ladle,"I was not very happy with this product. the ladle looked as if it was used a few times, because it had smudges on it that could not come off. I don't mind that since it did'nt cost much, but I will not order another and I do not suggest anyone to buy it."
5,Good Buy,"I use my punch bowls for fruit salad and need a strong ladle. This really fits the bill. It's strong, attractive design, and has a good size bowl."
4,Holds up great,"These are exactly what we needed for the residents of the retirement community. Multiple users, heavy usage, great product."
2,Just okay,"This seemed decent when I first opened it. In trying to get the label off of it, I had difficulty. I tried soaking and soaking the label with no luck. I resorted to Goo Gone. The Goo Gone ate into the surface of the ladle. Money not well spent, as it ended up in the garbage."
4,An Exciting and Involving Read,"I am very partial to ""overseas"" mysteries/thrillers....etc. Having read all of Henning Mankell's Inspector Wallender series, the Shanghai detective series (e.g. Death of A Red Heroine, etc.)and learned of Bitter Lemon Press and their activity in translating and publishing foreign mysteries. Well, this is a very well written and very introspective book; and having learned that the author translated much of Richard Brautigan's and Raymond Carver's work into German you can see the influence in his writing style. It's a very suspenseful read with lot's of interesting detours. Would love to read some of the author's other works --if and when they are translated into English."
5,With this book you'll make wonderful boxes!,This book has wonderfully clear instructions (better than those of Tomako Fuse). The best part of it is that it has color photos of each stage of the projects so that you can make sure you are following the directions correctly. The boxes I've made are beautiful and make nice gifts on their own. This is the book to buy if you are a beginning paper folder.
3,Impressive gift boxes made by a beginner!,I can't seem to put this book down. I take it with me and make boxes on the commuter train to work. I'm going to put homemade candy in them for Christmas gifts. I made them for my 2 grown children and wrote messages on scrolls to place inside.These boxes make unique gifts even when they are empty!
4,A good introduction to origami for the casual hobbyist.,I've often been interested in origami but never heard of an origami box until a friend introduced them to me. Besides being decorative they are rather a funtional craft for creating presents and holding small keepsakes. The books directions and illustrations are easier to follow than some crafts texts. I intend to use this as a manual for a adults' chafts class; material is inexpensive and the directions are easy for the beginner. The color photography does an excellent job of illustrating the variety of possibilities in colors and configurations.
5,Great for teachers!,"This is a good workbook for teachers and those who want to reproduce handouts on geography. It has limited descriptions and factual information (sparser than I expected). It is also useful for families with multiple children if you don't want the first to ""spoil it"" by writing in the pages for the second. A simple photocopy and each child can have a worksheet that does not have the answers marked up all over it."
2,that jon spencer sure louses up anther good record,"Jon spencer sticks his foot in the door again and his contributions are of questionable merit. Un-Spencered albums Too Bad Jim, or Acoustic Stories are much more to my liking. Sheeeesh! Spencer, butt out!"
3,a half-empty pocket,"I must unfortunately add to the low buzz of listeners who believe that JS detracts from this record. On their own, the JSBE is a mildly charming amalgamation worthy of a listen. And their riffing behind RL isn't without some merit - the guitar tones are what they should be. But John's shouting and hollaring get in your way like a drunk in the next row at the Super Bowl. Anything RL does qualifies as an essential purchase but when you add the fact that RL isn't making any money off this record (it never trickles down from Matador), this qualifies as the least essential of all."
4,jam session,basically a jam session with jon spencer whose guitar work really compliments and adds extra dimension to cd
5,Nice Value,"Yeah, I have art work of all sizes, especially up to about 25"" x 30"". This bag has plenty of pockets: places for your hard matted art work, soft art work, a pouch to carry your pencils, a pocket outside to carry items slightly larger than 8"" by 11"". The handle is equipped with Velcro so you can combine the handles when you're ready to carry your work. Great Item!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I am very disappointed to have had to pay $23 plus shipping for this minimal information book. Its scant 159 pages includes 18 blank pages for journaling, 4 pages of advertisements, 27 pages with small amounts of text ranging from one sentence to less than half a page, huge typeface (few words per page folks!), 2 pages of code of ethics, 2 pages of miminum teaching requirements, and many pages of about 1/2 page of text artfully centered on the page. So this leaves us with what - 98 pages of information, half of which is fluffy stories about the author? Please, wait for a better book - don't bother with this one unless you can get it for a few bucks."
3,No new information....,"I got nothing new in this book. When I got my attunements from my teacher, I got all the same info from the accomapnying manual by William Rand. Besides, I felt that the print in the book was like reading a draft on MS word!! The book was over-priced for what it gives the reader (considering you have to take a class anyway to get the attunements). Very disappointing."
3,Some interesting points,This book is OK. It has some interesting stories. And some limited practical uses.
5,"A well written resource, best read after a Karuna Reiki course","My first review was kind of negative and a bit unfair, because I was not ready for this book yet. I purchased it a few months before taking the Karune Reiki training. I was disappointed that there were no Karuna symbols in the book, as they were readily available from a variety of online sources. I now understand the reasoning for it.I was privileged to attend a Karuna Reiki Master Retreat in Sedona this Summer. I got this book out again beforehand to re-read it, and was surprised to see how much better it flowed for me a year after being attuned to the Karuna energies. Laurelle is truly a gifted Reiki teacher and writer. Her Karuna toning is nothing less than incredible, as is her work with Angelic realms.I highly encourage people to purchase this book, with the caveat that you should have the appropriate level of development to be able to truly take it in. Congratulations to Laurelle on a great book."
2,this book is poop,i used it for firewood because i was cold and i couldnt afford wood because my mom is in jail.
4,Steady Training,"Rarely does one find the time to read a book. It is even more rare to start a book and not want to put it down. Such was the case when I first started reading ""Steady Training"" by Antonio Bustillo.I've been fortunate to meet the author and to enjoy a training session with him prior to the Publication of this book. The guy was so sneaky as to not even let us know he was busy writing a book.I really enjoyed the book - many of the incidents were so similar to what I had experienced that it brought a good feeling to me knowing that the author wrote from within himself. This is a no-frills book which clearly highlights the author's travel from beginner level to where he is today.I certainly encourage you to read this book as it can only be of benefit.SincerelyHoosain Narker"
5,Steady Training,"This is one of the best books that I've read about martial arts/karate in recent years.I could not put the book down.It's a must read for all martial artist regardless of style or rank. The book was absolutely absorbing,opinionated,informative,funny and easy to read.The author is an old school karate ka with a modern and practical flavor to his training and teaching.I would buy the sequel to this book or any other book written by the author in a heart beat. Alex"
5,An Incredible Introduction to Feminism,"This book was my introduction to feminism several years ago, and over the years I have re-read it many times. The poor reviews clearly come from people who were threatened by Pollitt's intelligence and wit. I did not agree with all of her stands on the wide variety of issues she covers, but regardless of her opinion, the presentation is with great intelligence and wit. I was often rolling on the floor in laughter. The Smurfette Principle and On the Merits are among my favorites."
1,"yep, its pretty lame","well, women may indeed be reasonable creatures, but KP isnt one of them, just as this general category (women) is not equivalent to upper middle-class white gals from the upper East Side.P is fine on the Right, but horrible on the left and center. Kinda like HIlary and Bill.. It is too bad that the categories of race and class do not complicate her thinking. To the remainder bin with this one!"
1,"wish I could give ""negative stars""! the banality of it all!","well, as several other reviewers have noted, this is a boring, simplistic look at white women versus whiteguys. Has nothing to do with people of color, or issues of race, and if I am not mistaken, she is just annoyed that we all just cant forget our differences and realize that we are all middle-class whitefolk like M Wollstonecraft!One can see why pollitt is just a marginal reporter. She needs to stop writing, or go back to school!"
1,dont believe the hype......from either side,"its simply boring or, as one reviewer put it, it is awfully conventional. Good book for kids, though, who should all be able to read it. (Is that a good thing I wonder! ) She is not right wing but simply a progressive who simply isnt that deep or scholarly or learned. Her research consists of reading the Times, and her only move is the exposure of hypocrisy, neither of which makes her conservative (or radical!)-- just conventional."
3,"Fairly interesting, but...","I'm afraid that Katha Pollitt does very little to present the Woman of Color's differing, within these pages written by an economically and educationally priviledged white woman, who went to Radcliffe in the early '70s. I suppose her narrow perspective has rendered her arguments in this book extremely predictable, but there are more courageous voices writing today, especially bell hooks. Perhaps someday Pollitt will broaden her frame of reference, and we will see a genuinely revolutionary perspective. Until then, all we get is more of the white-male-this and white-male-that, which suggests that she identifies with them far more than challenges them."
1,racist trash,"dont bothertries to acknowledge critiques of the whiteness of US feminism, but really , she just wants them different folks to shut up and think of themselves as whitegals"
5,What an amazing book!,"I absolutely love this book! Along with the bible, this book has changed my life in so many ways. Being the godly woman that this book describes has changed my life and marriage for the better. I have recommended this book to so many women I know!!! Love it :)"
5,I recommend this book to EVERY wife,"This book was better than I ever hoped it would be. I felt more than just ""challenged"" in my role as wife and mother but inspired, encouraged and motivated!! LOVED this book"
5,THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"If you are a Christian woman this book is a MUST read. I was invited to a book/bible study and the woman's group where reading and discussing Feminine Appeal. I believe that this book has changed my life!! it has made me a better person, wife & mother. Give it a chance, you will not regret it.Elly O."
5,Going against the flow.,"This book has not only been insightful but also heartwarming. It confirms what I aspire to be with grace and refreshing charisma. What a useful tool this book is and will be in years to come. As I am entering my newly adult life, these viewpoints will challenge and make me the Proverbs 31 woman I so long to be. Thanks Carolyn for this wonderful gift, and may the Lord use this as an enlightening mechanism to open women's eyes all throughout this country."
5,Loved it,"Although this book may seem a little archaic to the modern woman, I really think the biblical principles it teaches are timeless. It's set up beautifully and easy to read (took me a few hours)and really helps you set standards for yourself and the kind of godly wife and mother you want to become. It doesn't say it's easy, or the norm in our world, but as a christian you know in your heart that it's right. Submitting to God and your husband is really the opposite of what we're taught on a daily basis from watching tv and movies, all the womens lib, feminist stuff. Yes it's important to be a strong, intelligent woman, but being a godly woman does not make you less strong or less intelligent. Quite the opposite :)"
5,Well written and enjoyable read,"This book is FULL of TRUTH without being preachy. She speaks the truth and backs it up. Simply, she just inspires us to do better, while humbly giving examples of her own failures and how her own eyes have been opened to these 7 truths. She reminds us of what is important to others (and getting our eyes off ourself), what the Bible says about these 7 subjects, and continually prompts us to look into our own hearts. She certainly does not talk down to women or put men on a pedastal above women.I found this book encouraging, and in some ways, life-changing. She helped me make a few changes that have had a tremendous impact on the atmosphere and joy in my own home, and I thank her for writing this gem."
4,excellent book for growth!,i love this book. it has been such an encouragement to me at this place in my life. i'm not married and i don't have children yet but someday i hope to (if the Lord will allow). this book is helping me prepare now.i'm in a small group Bible study that is pouring over this book and the scriptures mentioned in it. i highly recommend this book to anyone over the age of 16. i think it's a must read for all females.
5,Javascript for programmers,"This is an excellent book about Javascript/ECMA. If you want to learn the language that controls browsers from a programmer perspective, this is the book. Congratulations to the author that took Javascript seriously and wrote this book."
4,A Lesson For Us All,"For me this was not just the stories of the people directly affected by the attack on the World Trade Center. Rather it is a journey into and through the depths of grief. The people highlighted in this book, widows, siblings, survivors, witnesses, rescue-workers, take on the horror of 9/11 in different ways. Their recovery too must be as unique as they themselves. This is a hope-filled story, illuminating the fact that as much as a group may share a tragic event, their internalizing and their movement to recovery is theirs alone. Others may help by walking near us, but only we can heal ourselves."
5,A great read,"I was attracted to this book because the author describes it as a book about hope in the prologue. From the opening pages, Sheehy pulls you into the lives of these people who suffered tremendous loss on 9/11. It is a very inspirational and compelling story, not only about the people of Middletown, but also rescue workers, psychologists, policemen and firemen who were deeply effected. Sheehy weaves the many characters in the book and their personal stories with the great research and insights found in all of her books. A dramatic true story that reads with the pace of a novel. Great book."
1,"Sloppily researched, interesting trivia...","This author serves the subjects she chronicles poorly, with extremely sloppy research and writing. It's hard to believe any author could spend two years in a location, and so mischaracterize it!But, there is interesting trivia: Middletown South High School's principal is Nathan Lane's brother. Still more fascinating is the fact that passionate activist Democrat Kristen Breitweiser's murdered husband Ron was a ""rabid Republican"". Ever notice how there's no such thing as a ""rabid Democrat""?"
1,Altogether terrible.,"What a waste of time! This book is poorly written, redundant in the extreme, badly (if at all) edited, and replete with Sheehy's liberal bias. For example, all the Moslema/Arabs in Middletown are portrayed as victims of American bias--even when one of them repeats the canard about ""2900 Jews staying home from work at WTC on 9/11."""
1,Creepy,A blatant partisan account by a creepy psychobabbler who injected herself into the lives of mourning 9/11 families for her personal gain. A societal parasite who should stop meddling in other people's lives.
2,Review from Middletown Resident,"I've lived here all my life, and it is disappointing how Sheehy characterizes the area. I'm not talking about getting names and places wrong (which she does often), but getting the feel of the town wrong. She makes it seem like Middletown is filled with 2 types of people: low-class lifelong residents or high-class NYC transplants. To say that the town was ""disconnected"" before 9/11 and then ""joined"" after is not the case. Sheehy also continually links Middletown to the neighboring town of Rumson, and I am not sure why.The book is also much too long. Half the pages could have been sufficient."
2,"Started off good, but...","The author promises ""from tragedy to hope"". Sadly, after a while this spirals into a political book of blame aimed at the Bush Administration. I thought ""hope"" would be about being able to move on, not partisan politics. What a drag!"
5,Thought-provoking and irenic,"This book is a must read for any man or woman desiring to investigate the complex issue of gender roles and relationships in ministry today. Wrestle with her arguments, especially on the thought-provoking metaphor of head. You won't find Dr. Sumner supporting either side of the debate, egalitarian or complementarian, so if you are expecting something to support your preconceived views, you may be disappointed. But if you are willing to give these issues a fresh look, this book will spark new thinking. Her irenic spirit is refreshing. And if you are a man attempting to understand women in leadership today, her book will be invaluable because she has been there! Not heady, but substantive and well written.Dr. Sue Edwards, Assistant Professor of Christian Education, Dallas Theological Seminary"
1,Dr. Groothuis couldn't have said it better,"In reading the reviews of this book I began to wonder if they read the same book I did. However, I must concur with Dr. Groothuis assessment in referring to this as a ""frustrating"" and fuzzy book, and that ""clear compelling arguments are absent."" At times I believe Sumner over analyzes arguments by others, and at other times does not analyze them enough. Further if men in the Christian church are half as arrogant and chauvinistic as she at times portrays them to be, the Church of Christ today is indeed a mess. Time and time again she tell us how men feel or what men believe. Time and time again I kept thinking that she is wrong. I would not recommend this book to anyone, as there are many other books out there that deal much more realistically and Biblically with the subject than Sumner's."
2,Eve's spirit still with us,Interesting to note that how easily it is to see through the subtle attacts upon God's order through seemingly reasoned thoughts. Even the serpent of old reasoned with Eve and swayed her. Then she swayed Adam. Must let God's word be the final authority and not man's reason alone.
4,Early Oldfield Live!,This DVD depicts Mike Oldfield's musical artistry and compositional talents with an enjoyable admixture of his earlier works in his incredible litany of offerings.
5,This One Blew Me Away!,"I have been a fan of Mike Oldfield since Tubualr Bells was first released. He is one of the few artists that I never got to see in concert. Well, this little jewel of a DVD more than makes up for this. I always knew what a great composer he was, and figured that his records were mostly studio overdubs. Well, this video shows what an incredible guitarist and musician he really is, even in a live setting. The backup band are all stellar musicians as well, some playing several different instruments. There are two drummers, and at one point, there are three. The very polite audience knew what a rare treat this concert was, as you can tell by their enthusiastic response between compositions. This was filmed at what is probably considered his artistic peak, with the release of QE2. I can ignore the few minor quibbles, since this was filmed 25 years ago. Mike Oldfield on DVD is better than none at all. Money well spent!!!!"
3,Learn in a hard way,Decent one for anybody trying to grasp Java - with an abundantly available time of course.
3,Found,"Have you ever been lost? Well this book was all about being found. That's the books name. It's about 4 kids who are hiding because of a law that's saying you can only have one kid. While hiding they find a child on their bed. So they name it ""found."" This story is like a book of survival between these 5 kids. I really enjoyed this book because it was about adventure and survival. In the end, ""Found"" gets really sick and that's were the book begins to get exciting. They try to find help and they do. My opinions about this book is that it is a good book and I really liked it.The reason I liked this book was one, because it was really self explanatory and made you feel like if you were in the story. Next, you can imagine the whole story from beginning to end. I loved reading this book."
5,"Humor, suspense, mystery and romance","When I read the first pages of this book, I had to buy it. I immediately identified with the heroine, Tiffany, and was compelled to turn the pages to find out what she would do next. The book was a quick read, and a real page turner. This is the first book I have read in a while that made me laugh out loud one moment and be indignant for the heroine the next. I guarantee I'll be one of the first in line to buy Shirlee McCoy's next book."
4,Good Customer Service,"I was not as pleased with this product as I had hoped to be. When I contacted the seller, they were very apologetic, were very helpful about providing good customer service and I will buy from them again based on their speedy, friendly response."
2,Slightly painful,"Had to purchase this book for class. Book consists of case studies for the ""global"" world of communication. Book attempted to illustrate the differences of various cultures and how they interact with one another in business like relationships. Overall based merely on the class setting the book was not the most conducive manner in which to demonstrate international cultural relationship. Only entertainment was derived from the ironic slight racist undertone of some of the case studies. Overall would not recommend."
1,Worthless,"Unlike other case studies in the Allyn & Bacon series, this book proved worthless. You could find better cases by searching Google or reading ""intercom,"" the magazine of the Society for Technical Communication.If the instructor requires it, buy the cheapest copy you can, because you'll be selling it back to someone else. This will ensure the maximum resale value."
1,Slow shipment,"I have been waiting for an entire month now, and have still not received the book that I purchased on the 5th of August. This is ridiculous. I wouldn't buy anything from this seller again..."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. I will donate it to a resale shop, not worth the cost to send it back. Not a book for me at all."
2,"Different title, but same DVD","I bought another DVD of the same concert. Now I have two identical DVDs. This is very deceptive. It is not right to sell a similar product with different titles. This DVD has Jimmy on the cover, but he was not eve in the concert. I felt cheated. And I bought almost every of their DVDs."
3,Osmonds Live,"Good footage of the 70's Osmania, but, the performance was in front of a very mellow audience which took away from the viewing. However, the brothers sang their hearts out anyway. Overall, a bit tame."
3,JUST OK...,"I ordered this DVD because there are very few vintage concert recordings available from this 70's supergroup. Be forewarned: the production/sound quality is poor. Also, the ""wildly enthusiastic studio audience"" ISN'T! I have to wonder if they even know who the performers are...they all just sort of sat there...and this was taped during the height of Osmondmania...LOL! Only recommended if you're a die-hard Osmond fan from back in the day like I am..."
1,Not nearly as good as I remember,"I was a huge fan of The Osmonds back in the day. In fact, I can even remember when they changed their name from The Osmond Brothers to The Osmonds. But, times have changed and so have I. I did not realize how much until I started watching this DVD. I had been looking forward to seeing Donny again.What a shock I received when I placed this into my DVD player! The costumes that were hideous even back in 1972, were even more so now. They put in a tremendous effort and much work into their performance. But, all in all, their music is just not nearly as good as I remember. I watched the first five songs, then I just couldn't handle it any more. Simply put, it was bad. This DVD had poor sound and picture quality. The music was watchable until Donny sang Too Young. Than it became unbearable.Some things should stay in the archives or the vault or wherever they keep historical recordings. Some things are better as cherished memories that are best not relived."
2,Very cursory coverage of ASP .NET,"As a an ASP developer and an IT Professional, I wanted to get up to speed on ASP .NET 2.0, so I picked up a copy of this book.I would not recommend it to others, as it is not very well written.Also, the examples are very GUI-oriented without deviating too much from Wizards and such. If you're more interested in being able to write ASP .NET 2.0 code by hand, and fully understanding how it all works this book is not very helpful.I also picked up a copy of Professional Asp.Net 2.0 (also from WROX) which, although more advanced, is easier to read and understand.This book (beginning ASP .NET) is only useful if you want a quick tour of what ASP .NET 2.0 Can do, and not even a full tour at that."
3,Harder than it should be.,Although the book is well set out and easy to read you are constantly troubled by the errors in both the code and the dialog. Fortunatly a lot of the errors can be correctedvia the Wrox web site. I found it useful to download the working code for the book and compare it with the text to correct many errors. Should a reader really need to do this? Unlike a previous reviewer I had no trouble viewing the example WroxUnited site.
1,"Exercises Poorly Organized, Downloaded Files Buggy","I was very disappointed with this book. To do the exercises, you have to download a ZIP file from the Wrox web site. The installation instructions in the book don't match what's in the ZIP file. Once you do get them installed, they're frequently buggy. Checking the forums on the Wrox bulletin board is of little help as many questions about these bugs seem to have gone unanswered.The book looked like it had potential, but now I'm looking at other options."
2,Very confusing and inconsistent,"It's a good thing that I have a bit of experience in the software/web development world. If I were truly ""begining"" my experience with ASP.net this book would have me very frustrated. As mentioned in several prior reveiws, the examples are poorly organized and often confusing. The directory structure used for each example is incosistent from example to example... If the premise of the book is to teach us by having us build an applictaion, a good idea in theroy, then let us build the apllication on chapter at a time basis using each new exercise to build on what we've already created in the previous exercise. If the authors really felt it would help to download code for each exercise... than please use a consistent file/directory hierarchy in your explanations... which seldom matches the actual file hierarchy of the downloaded code... well at least through chapter 3 anyway. That's all the farther I got before I felt compelled to write this review."
2,Disaster,"If you enjoy spending ages correlating a colossal errata with its respective book, then this book is for you.If you enjoy following instruction to the letter to find the project crash, then this book is for you.If you enjoy code-generating wizards as distinct from writing code, then this book is for you.It was not for me."
2,No C# and no VS2005,"Probably a good book if you don't care about learing about Visual Studio 2005 and ONLY want to learn it in Visual Basic. Since I'm only interested in C#, I don't know why I even purchased this book in the first place???"
1,All Examples in VB,I purchased this book and will be returning it because the examples are all in Visual Basic. The only place I saw this information was on the publishers web site. These books should be marked what lanaguages their examples are in.All ASP.Net books should have C# examples in my opinion. They took the easy way out.
3,Power Mile Isn't Powerful,"This video does not meet Leslie's usual high quality. The music is not up to par and the sound fades in and out, which is very distracting. At one point, it is difficult to hear the music at all. The routine is short but by using hand weights, Leslie manages to create a more intense workout in 20 minutes."
2,Hard to follow,"I loved Stacey's first book, Inappropriate Men, but this book is a mess. Each chapter is about a different girl (five, in all) so you switch story lines in each chapter. It is very hard to follow. I had to constantly refer back to previous chapters to determine what was going on. I am near the end and still can't keep track of everyone. A big disappointment!"
3,Too much in one story,"The book starts to get good in certain areas, but there are too many characters and points of view. I actually tried to write out a cheat sheet w/ characterstics of the 5 main women, but it was still too confusing. That in itself ruined the book for me :("
1,Stupid!,"I am ashamed to admit, but I read the first half of the book, in one night. Memorial day weekend, nothing better to do, no other book available... you know the story. With every page I felt my IQ diminishing. It is not only unrealistic and plainly unintelligent, but it's also badly written, with numerous grammatical mistakes (not in parts that were meant to be there).It might be a good read when you're stuck on a plane with some baby crying in the back all the way from Sydney to New York, but otherwise, don't bother.It's offensively moronic."
1,The cover is the best thing about this book,"There is not much to recommend here. Sleeping Over is one of the more dull reads in the chick-lit universe. Bad enough that the main characters are not very interesting, but there are five of them and quite frankly they are interchangeable. Despite the fact that each chapter is devoted to one of the 5 main characters, it is hard to tell these women apart beyond the names they have been given. And the main conceit of the book, that all of these women have a man in their life for whom sleeping together is not a euphemism but rather a literal fact, strains credibility. truth is, the cover photo is the most interesting book as there is more action in that one picture than in the entirety of the book."
2,"Modern day ""Fairytale"" - Yawn!","I am usually easy to please when it comes to chick lit, but this book is over the top. Give me a break! Every female character in this book gets their dream guy under picturesque circumstances by the end. The characters are flawed, but are never really developed, and instead of caring about them, they become needy and a tad annoying. This book that leads you to believe it is about 5 fabulous, independant women turns out to be the story of Sleeping Beauty x5 without conflict or climax and straight to the happily ever after...For good Chick Lit, try Emily Giffin or Jennifer Weiner."
1,Either a fluke or inferior product,"We have been using this Bosch roto hammer drill for years. Normally the bit lasts for six to ten months. This one lasted two uses. Not sure if it was really a Bosch or an aftermarket. It says it was made in germany! We have never had one break like this, and it is three weeks out of warranty. So now I will try to go to a Bosch retailer to get one."
4,A good read.....,"I am only giving this book four stars, because it was completely outdone by the movie, it lacked power in some areas, and had a highly disappointing ending that leaves you hanging.Yes, it is a good read that can crack a smile on your face or make you pity Andy Dufresne and feel his pain....but it simply lacked that *PUNCH*.All in all, however, a good book. I'd say it was worth your time....Well, I guess I'm just used to the movie...which -- and I swear this is probably the only time I'll ever say this in my life -- is better than the book."
2,Only missing the hooker with a heart of gold,"As a story, a four or five star, with solid story telling that held my interest but I could not put aside its naive depiction of prisons and prisoners. Through the voice of Red, a most sympathetic narrator, Mr. King appears to express such antipathy toward the very premise of incarceration. The author does not even attempt to reconcile the book's representation of Red as the narrator/moral center of the story with the heinous crime that brought him there in the first place. Notwithstanding this problem, I really did enjoy the story and I would have wholly enjoyed it if Mr. King had conveyed Red's transformation from amoral killer to the sagely center of the tale."
2,Only for Fanatics,"I picked this up because I admire AJ's vocal gymnastics and the price was attractive. However, on this set of lo-fidelity recordings (I presume from very early in his recording career) there's not a bit of flair. In fact, these versions add nothing to the original interpretations. If you're looking for soul standards with AJ's trademark vocalistics, pass this one up. Family members and die-hard fans may find this worthwhile as a souvenir of Al's start in the business, but others will likely find this to be sorely lacking in any meritable material."
2,"Good product, disappointed with service","I received this product from the company in a timely manner. It was a good looking jacket but the size Large was way too big. I called the customer service number because you have to get a Return Authority # from the company before you can return an item. Well, I called the number on the invoice which directed me (all automated, no real person ever answers) to call another number for returns. Again, I got an automated system which asked me to leave a message and they would get back with me, usually within 24 hours. This time came and went so I called back and left another message. Finally, a couple days later someone contacted me to give me my return number. I filled out the info. on the back of the invoice to exchange it for a size Medium. Instead, the company just returned the item and refunded my money with no further contact. This was super frustrating since my husband really like the jacket. I wouldn't deal with company again."
1,Cheese Spreader - Antique Ivory,"Very disappointed at this product. Looked better in photo than reality. Cheap, plastic, waste of money and certainly no antique or ivory."
1,2nd one that's broke! :(,"This is the 2nd and LAST one of these I buy. It looks great, nice lambskin and all, but the plastic part that snaps into the belt holster is CHEAP! too bad"
5,Great Movie,"What a great story, with something for the WWII 8th Air Force enthusiast as well as a story of enduring love rediscovered. When Amazon offered this for sale I bought it immediately with memories when it was shown on HBO. I was initially concerned what the transfer would be like however my concern was unfounded as my copy was very clear and crisp with the audio being very much the same. I highly recommend this DVD."
5,Good film with great cast,"This is a very well thought out film about a group of guys who served together in WW2 and were stationed in England going back to the old base for a reunion years later. Mitchum and Kerr reunite on film and in the story and really help to notch this up. Red Buttons does a great job as one of the vets. There is a side story about a child from a war time romance and her interaction with the vets. Nice to see a romance on film for those of us over 50. I'm sure that anyone who enjoys a good film, about real people, or the war or seeing real actors for the 40's and 50's still doing good work will like this one."
5,The molding of an editor,Mr Kosner details his rise to become an editor at several journalist institutions. The best part of this book is how he describes the non-glorifying and very anti-climatic process of being fired. it is never easy ona person and this author described that perfectly. The ending of this book which lists several traits that should define a person are an extra bonus with this book. It was smart to include in this book.
3,Ok,"It is a nice cookbook however, when you are going through chemo it is hard to eat right and there are some good recipes in here but too many ingredients in some of the recipes."
5,Excellent,This is the best value I've received in a long time. It is an excellent duplex printer. It is fast and works well with any program I have right now. I've been using it since May of 12 and have absolutely no problems with it.
1,Nothing but problems,"This scanner for me has been nothing but problems. A seemingly good idea (making the scanner like a fax machine so it can scan multiple pages) is muddled by bad software and shoddy construction. The scanner constantly jams, cannot handle anything on paper thicker than printer paper (i.e. photos), and the scanner software frequently looses contact with the scanner. Do you self a favor and don't buy this product."
4,Good Duplex Scanner & Software Bundle,We have been using the Xerox 152 scanner for a few months & they have performed well. Both color & Duplex this small scanner works well in home/office setting w/ quick feeding and a small footprint. The software is very good Paperport 10/11 & omnipage that does everything we need it to do. We have purchased 10 units and besides a squeek or two no major problems. Recommend leaving PaperPort open all day rather than openning & closing the software each time it is used (not a hardware issue) this seems to have stopped the Paperport issue of not launching w/ each scan. Enjoy!
2,Good scanner bad software partner.,"The scanner itself is pretty good.The software is not bad but can be very slow. The software support is pretty sketchy. The company 'Nuance' / Visioneer whatever company name that provides the paperport, onetouch drivers charge $10 an email. Also it seems that they are a bit of upseller. I just feel they built in things to their software that will require you to seek support so they can make more money.e.g. their online registration process does not work when you give them your serial number. I've attempted it numerous times. They won't let me get the 'automatic update' function without a 'successful' registration. Well obviously if their registration process doesn't work we'd have to seek out support for $10 a pop. This doesn't seem like a coincidence.Bad choice for Xerox. I wish they picked a more reputable partner. I'm going to try find different software for this scanner if possible."
1,ADF pad apparently not available,"I have used the DocuMate 152 scanner on some thousands of pages and the ADF pad has worn out. When I contacted our Office Supply store about this, they began to search for a replacement. After waiting some time, I called them back. They told me that none of their suppliers have a replacement ADF pad.I had no idea that it would be so expensive to use this scanner."
3,Average scanner - below average software,The scanner works OK but after 8 months of use and aproximately 2000 scans it has been anything but flawless. The software is not great and it requires too many mouse clicks to scan documents. Minor issues like a misfeed has at times required a complete computer reboot. No issues with scan quality or speed. The scanner portion is good but misfeeds some. The software needs an update.
4,Easy to Use,"When I purchased this product, I was hoping it would be easy to use. I was very surprised at how easy it is. I do need to research a little more and I am sure it can do even more than what I am using it for."
1,"Scan Volumes Over 10,000 FORGET THIS UNIT","The scanner is perfectly capable and in fact does a very good job on 20 or fewer pages per set. However, there is a wear item that they don't warn you about. It's called a ADF Pad assembly. They provide an extra one ""Free"" with every scanner. The wear part is a little silicone rubber pad smaller than a postage stamp. To get a replacement from Xerox will cost you $99.99 for a ""cleaning kit, that has two pads and some alcohol pads and swabs. BUT, if you call to bring this to their attention, they WILL make a special deal for you at $29.95 per assembly IF you have a bulk order of 24 or so.I am going to find some 1/16"" silicon rubber sheeting and cut my own. Should come out to about $0.10 per fix."
1,Great Idea with Awful Execution,"I forked over 'real' money for this scanner because I didn't want something that was mickey mouse. I also thought that it would be better to get a product that just claims to do one thing - scan - instead of a multifunction print/copy/fax/scan. I was willing to pay an extra $150 to get duplexing so that I wouldn't have to cobble together documents that were printed on both sides. Makes sense so far, and it is probably why you are looking into this scanner.I strongly recommend against it. Even though I am good with technology, I can't beat this thing into shape. It jams, it fails to initialize, the software is awful and there is too much of it (multiple apps.) Even the OCR is worse than some of the free versions out there.I want it to work, I'm still in love with the concept, but this is not even a $100 machine. Please don't waste your money on it."
2,Can't Get Replacement ADF Pad,This scanner worked wonders the first day I used it. I scanned about 200 pages that all turned out nicely. There were a few jams but were easy to fix. The second day everything went to pot. There is a little rubber pad that keeps the pages going straight. This part stopped doing its job after about 60 pages and then everything went squeegee. I went to the Xerox support website that offers replacement parts. They didn't have the part! I then contacted Office Max where I had ordered it and they no longer have the part! All they could do was send a whole new scanner to replace mine. I checked google for the part and found it costs over $35 to replace! This isn't worth the hassle. It's too bad because the scanner looks nice on my desk and does a very nice job until the part goes out.
3,xerox documate 152,"The scanner is reasonably quick, once it warms up. After going to sleep mode, you need to wait for the scan lamp to warm up, maybe 10 to 15 seconds.The paper handling has been perfect. I have had no misfeeds so far.We also use the scansnap scanners. The xerox sheet feeder is superior, and handles paper much better. The scanning speed is a little slower than the fujitsu.The quality of the scans are very good."
5,Rider & Weiser had the jump on U.S. Games,"Before U.S. Games Systems Inc. put a copyright on Stuart R. Kaplan's ""little white book"" (the enclosed instructions, and not the actual Tarot and/or the art by Pamela Colman Smith), Weiser was working with Rider & Co. of London selling this deck in America. If you can find a copy, buy it. There's no silliness about a copyright, and the quality of the 1970s Rider decks, printed in Switzerland by A.G. Muller, is wonderful. And you'll even see that Weiser has their name on the famous yellow box, and their own edition of the ""little white book"" too. Cheers!"
4,Will leave a smile on your face !,I found this treasure while at my local library. This is a fun love story of two police officers who find love in a small Colorado town. Lanie is leaving the Magestic police force and meets Paul her replacement from Miami. Lanie breaks her leg the night of her going away party chasing a suspect and Paul finds her and takes her the ER. The story of Lucille (Lanie mother) and Chief of Police Deutsch is sweet secondary romance. I plan to search out more of Stef Ann Holm novels.
2,What a snoozer!!,"I was kind of looking forward to this one. It looked cute and homey, and the back of the book detail seemed promising. However, things didn't maintain a decent speed for me, and there seemed to be no action what-so-ever at all after the big opening scene and the drama therein.Laney seemed to be just sitting around while her widowed mother's love-life had a little drama thrown in with a possible love interest from the snotty and smarmy chief of policy, which seemed to pick up the storyline a bit. But even the new cop in town, Paul, who left Miami FL for the smalltown gig seemed like he was getting bored.I started hesitating picking this book up, and eventually picked up something else. This one was tough to push through for sure. I only made it to chapter 8."
4,Sweet yet satisfing...,"In the first couple of chapters I feared a boring read, or at least not my type. I continued on and by mid-book I found I did not want to put the book down until I was finished. It is a sweet story, a strong female character who finds she may not be so strong, has emotions, and conflicts with what she thinks she wants and what she really wants. Nice HOT male character who is kind, giving, and morale. Will support 'his woman' not matter what. The build up was nice and slow, yet entrancing and a nice surpirse ending. Not the typical begging, crying, I hate you, I love you kind. Both knew what they wanted, what the other needed and were willing to try to find both."
3,ok for a 100.00 set,"I paid 100.00 for 2 of these new 4 years ago.they are large and good at higher volumes they do have some distortion when worked hard .my receiver is 110 rms .the bass is good mids and highs ok at best,they did will on speaker stands and if you use a powered sub set the crossover around 80 and these will do well.the bose 301 are better to a degree but 229.00 worth better i cant say.these are not good at low levels but im using them in a bed room not my living room so i didnt want to buy a real expensive speaker for a second system i wouldnt use that much.they are a 100.00 per set speaker new but i dont think they make them anymore 200.00 for 1 used is too much money .dont expect any speaker your paying 50.00 for each new to sound loke a 400.00 set its not going to happen but these were a good budget speaker just a bit large but loud make no mistake they will crank."
3,"Even for the price, they're not much better than OK","These speakers are cheap, but even at $100 or less, they are OK at best. I suppose my biggest concern about the value is how little price difference there is between these and much better speakers if you can find them on sale. I've had these in my office for over a year, figuring why spend a lot when it's just an office, but I've never been that happy with them. I found some Polks marked down on clearance for just $50 more and they are a significantly better speaker.However, if your goal is just ""get speakers"" because you don't have anything at all right now--these are not bad, especially at low volumes. They just aren't great, and the boominess and distortion on anything even somewhat loud is pretty rough."
5,Great sound for the price,"It has a tweeter.LOL Fabulous. I purchased these a few weeks ago to add as a second pair to my system. Awesome, the 1 inch tweeter along with the 8 inch woofer, and 4 inch midrange really brings out the high end of the music.Didn't expect that tweeter. And the price was great. I looked at them at a local store, and they wanted $179 for the pair. Buying them here, I got a free speaker."
3,3.5 stars for entertainment value. useful for intermediate+ students,"I've gotten into the habit of reading this at bedtime to reviewkanji even though that's not the purpose of this book. As a lower intermediate student -- sentences in ordinary texts are too simple and pat. This is where BJI comes in. You'll get such colorful gems as ""I started seeing my best friend's BF so now we're involved in a messy love triangle"" and ""Jiro filched 1000 yen from his mother's wallet."" The idioms themselves are rather bland but I did learn very interesting tidbits like ""neko baba"" which is idiomatic for feigning innocence. Baba is baby talk for poop and cats often cover up their toilet with soil hence the ""feigning innocence"" link. BJI is well worth a look -- my Jtutor saidthese idioms are old-fashioned but still sometimes used. You'll learn more about the Japanese mindset if nothing else."
4,Patternmaking for Fashion Design,"The book is great but I advise you buy the hardcover issues, the papers rip-off really easily in the ring-bound version. On receiving it I had a couple of papers ripped off already!"
1,patternmaking for fashion design,This item was a big surprise. I was advertised as being new. And I am sad to say it was not.
1,HELP with this book,Some of the reviewers are right This book definitely is tough and hard to understand.Could any one please help me with the slinky skirt pattern on page 254-255 I just couldnt make head or tail of it.PLEASE HELP SOMEBODY.Do send me a mail at t29017155@yahoo.co.in
4,A plea from a taller woman,"A tall woman with shoulders broadened by swimming, I spent hours looking for clothes (in flattering colors) that actually fit. Although I hadn't sewn much since I was in 4-H more than 30 years ago, I was inspired when I saw the marvelous patterns in this book and was able to follow the instructions fairly readily. This work, and the marvelous book, the Triumph of Individual Style by Carla Mathis and Helen Connor, have allowed me to dress in both flattering and expressive ways. Simultaneously, I would love it if Ms. Armstrong would include in future editions information relevant to pattern making and modification for the thousands and thousands of women taller than the sizes specified in standard misses patterns, information that I ended up culling from less comprehensive books on pattern alteration."
5,Hilarious,I got this book for Christmas and it was just great. I never laugh out loud but this book had me roaring in laughter. Several times I made my husband come over so he could appreciate what I found so funny.This is a must own book for any cat lover...would make a great gift too!
5,Pure hilarity and genius!!!,I read The Wild Life of Cats and I can't get over how funny it is. Leigh Rubin is a comic genius and that comes across loud and clear in this book!! This is a must read if you love cats and if you love humor. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
4,Iron & Silk,"When I received this book I was surprised to find that it was in extra large print, which was not necessarily a problem, just unexpected. Perhaps that is my fault for not reading the fine print closely enough.The book itself is good - about experiences working in semi-rural China in the early 80's when China was mostly closed to Westerners. The pace is fine although at times the storytelling can become a bit monotonous, but never enough to make me stop reading. An interesting introduction to Chinese traditional culture from a Western point of view with an insight to martial art training. Would recommend to friends, especially upon returning from China."
2,a little small,"I received a $75 gift certificate for my birthday, and used it to buy the most expensive gloves I had ever owned. Measured, of course, and glad for the opportunity to get a perfect fit on gloves which were NOT my usual knit. Unfortunately, they turned out to be tight, not comfortable at all. I use them to sweep the snow off my windshield; then, because this soaks them through and through, I change to my old knit 75 cent stretch gloves from Target for driving."
4,Nelscott brings nice insight to Black History,"This book picks up where ""A Dangerous Road"" left off, and continues the excellence! Nelscott brings unique perspectives of the Black experience during the turbulent 60's. She does it while weaving a tale of mystery, intrigue and double dealing. This is the start of, I hope, a series of Smokey Dalton novels. Maybe Nelscott could have Smokey meet Tamara Hayle in Newark, N.J."
5,outstanding,"Featured on Nick Warren's GU Brazil CD, Paul Oakenfold's essential mixes, and many other trance compilations, this song is getting popular quickly. And with good reason. Uplifting steady and consistent the song keeps rising, yet never getting too chaotic or frantic. Consistent melodic uplifting soaring. Trance the way it out to be! Nice mixes here, especially the vocal ones. Smile!"
4,Irresistable,"Welcome, newcomers, to Guided By Voices. If you've not heard the group before, this is where you want to start. Ignore the opening track (that's probably what lead man Robert Pollard wants you to do anyway), and start with ""So Sad If I Lost It"" and continue onward. You'll find yourself enmeshed in perfect pop hooks, hard 70's rockers, and even blissful folk. The lyrics are bizarre, but that's part of the point. Look for a message and you'll be lost, at least most of the time. For Pollard likes to mix real emotions in with his odd lyrics to create a interesting feelings, and if the lyrics of the beautiful ""Now to War"" don't chill you to the bone, well...If you enjoy this album, keep going. Know that the further back you go, the worse the sound gets (these guys used to be DIY champs)but that the music will stay fairly consistent... And welcome to the club! Guided By Voices is a band out of the past, all for the future!"
3,When the talented misfire,"Every talent misfires occassionally, and that's what happened here. There are glimpses of the amazing GBV sound and songwriting here, but there's no consistency making it a frustrating listen. It's still better than 85% of what's out there though."
4,Really cohesive,"This is definitely the most overlooked GBV album, and I can't get over how well it holds together as a whole. Although the preceding _Under the Bushes_ has perhaps more ""standout"" tracks, _Mag Earwhig_ is a more complete album and sounds less cobbled-together. This is probably the GBV album I'd point someone to after the indispensable ""Bee Thousand"", ""Alien Lanes"", and ""Isolation Drills"". _Mag Earwhig_ is packed with tunes that gradually come out and wrap around your brain, like all classic GBV albums."
5,Best GBV album to date,"I still can't figure out why GBV fans don't love this album like a first-born child. It's just brilliant. The addition of Doug Gillard on guitar adds a new dimension of musicianship to this band. Once just masters of the pop hook, Bob Pollard and co. have proven that drunken hicks can produce some of the most cutting-edge, artistic music around. So there."
2,Good idea...,"I love the design idea on this headset. You can wear it around your neck and have the earpieces at hand all the time. The problem is the earpieces themselves are the worst I've used. They are completely uncomfortable and keep falling out, and it's not just due to the cord being too thick. In terms of quality it's a great headset though, but it was basically a waste of money for me since it bothers me so much. If this headset was designed with custom fit eargels like the Jabra headsets, it would be excellent."
2,Clunky and uncomfortable,"I am so disappointed with this product. The earphones are large and uncomfortable. The wires are heavy and bend oddly because they have protective hard cloth around them, presumably to make them more durable. And when I speak with someone I sound like I am far away, which makes sense because the receiver falls down by your belly button. I will never use this headset. It was a waste of $12."
5,Gackt is best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you don't know Gackt-sama's style and you want to, thisCD is certainly good for you. Gackt is one of the best J-PopArtists, and even if you're not familiar with Japanese musicor the language, you'll like this CD!Of course, for J-Pop/ Visual Rock lovers,this CD is a MUST-BUY!!!!!"
5,Outstanding Sabre,"I completely agree with the previous review. This saber is very well made and the balance is beyond exceptional. I can hardly believe the difference vs the sabres my school provides for students who haven't purchased their own gear yet. The handle has just the right shape to encourage and aid fast wrist movement and control. Even the 2 slot electrical connector for competition scoring is solid and well made. I'm VERY happy I spent the money for this high end sabre and can't recommend it enough for those who want a quality weapon to learn or compete with.Just to establish I know what I'm talking about here too, while I am somewhat new to sport fencing, I have 3 decadess of experience in armed and unarmed martial arts, and 15 years experience as an automotive technician, so I have a discerning eye for quality weapons and training gear as well as physically well made products."
5,The Visual Dictionary of Ships and Sailing,"If it's on a sailing vessel (from Acacia pole to Zygian), the item is in here. Great book, beautifully illustrated."
1,What is it good for?,I was told that snake oil would help with acne but I found it to be quite ineffective. It also has a strange odor. Can anyone tell me what they found it useful for??
1,Never again!,I was not pleased with this product because it contains mineral oil. Another ingredient is listed and I have no idea what it is.
5,A Sunday School How-To Book,"Gail Thomas McKenna has answered almost all of the questions anyone involved in Catholic religious education could have regarding adult and children's classes, materials, and how to start a program from scratch. This book is so easy to use since it's broken down by subject and then by question. There is no need to read the whole book in one sitting. All you have to do is fish around for what you're looking for and I guarantee it'll be in there. Bravo for a much-needed book."
5,memories,"i loved the dvd, Me and my son watch the dvd to teach him that being small is not always bad and he loves it as well. brings back memories of when i use to watch these guys play. works fine shipping is fine and price is fine."
4,"Damned Nation, a rollicking good read","As a big fan of the game these books are based on, I was not disappointed. Once again Nick Pollata gave us a rollicking good story that was both entertaining and exciting. It featured several plot twists and surprises and even had a quick cameo by Team Tunafish, even though the American Civil War was 175 years before their time! I heartily endorse this latest chapter in the staro of B13 and recommend it to anyone who loves the game itself, or just likes a good adventure story."
1,Proof of how far we have fallen culturally,"If nothing else, this book of would-be verse is a testament to the very sad state of poetry, and of our debased collective sensibilities. It's fundamentally more a tribute to current hype and politics than to any real art or thought."
2,Italy obviously starts south of Naples,"The author uses her own and her family's experiences and extrapolates them to an entire population. She also perpetuates the same ""racism"" she seeks to erase. Beginning with chapter 4, the stereotypes and racist generalizations begin about Northern Italians vs. Southern Italians. A real disappointment. This book is NOT about Italian Americans, it is one person's memories/opinions. The sad thing is that the book is marketed as an ethnic revelation. It's not."
2,Dont waste your time reading this book.,This little book has nothing in it but some mushy personal commentary and does not do the subject of the Italian experience justice. No substance or depth compared to other books about Italians and their heritage and history.
4,I always was italian,"I really enjoyed Maria's book. She grew up in the same eraas myself, but she grew up isolated in the 'burbs, while I grewup in a largely italian area. The difference of her experienceas well as her reactions to it were fascinating. Well written, interesting and informative. A good read, and explains a lot about the ""mobster mentality"" that is erroneously associatedwith Italian americans"
1,Pretentious Drivel,"The author seems bent on impressing us with her ""literary knowledge"" and tosses in quotes for effect. However, the book remains the whining self-important story of one person from a wacked-out family. Grow up and move on. I hope this isn't representative of my proud Italian heritage. I was given this for Christmas and was sorely disappointed."
2,"Boring, superficial, and full of self-loathing","This book is so plodding, devoid of life or drama, and biased against Italian and Italian-American life that it's a wonder it was published. Laurino is Italian in very little beside name, and her attempt to extract some ""fine writing"" from her shallow explorations of her heritage is startlingly unsuccessful. She barely knows Italian, prefers various other cultures to her own, and spends much of her time talking about either how she was obsessed with not smelling bad as an adolescent or how she found her relatives living in the Stone Age in southern Italy. The author is one of those people who should have changed her last name and left it at that. A magnificently useless book."
5,Original and informative,"Were You Always an Italian? taught me much that I did not know about Italian-American and southern Italian culture. Now I better understand how class bias, academic bias, and popular culture stereotypes have affected the identity of Italian Americans. The chapter ""Words"" about southern Italian dialect brought back many memories of the words I knew growing up. I'm sharing this book with my family and friends."
5,A good companion,"Readers who like this book also will like ""The Last Cannoli"" by Camille Cusumano. It's a fictionalized account of a Sicilian-American family as it evolves from the 1950s to the 1990s. It's a warm, insightful (nearly first-person) account that, in my experience, involves the reader, even a reader without a bit of Sicilian blood."
3,Not as comprensive as others for Series 2,"I bought this book and ""Hacking the Tivo, Second Edition"". The two books cover a similar range of hacks and include Linux boot CDs. However there are key Series 2 hacks that are not covered in this book. For example, video extraction is a very valued hack. I want to transfer videos between my Series 2 Tivo and my PC.""Hacking Tivo"" backs away from this hack on Series Two claiming ""legal reasons"". Bah! ""Hacking the Tivo, Second Edition"" shows you how to do this and shows the likely reason why ""Hacking Tivo"" avoided it. It's harder! ""Hacking the Tivo, Second Edition"" is written by someone who loves every aspect of hacking the machine and it shows. Get this one instead."
4,Hands on review,"Just finished upgrading the hard drive on my Series 1 TiVo. Had I not bought Jeff Keegan's ""Hacking TiVo"" book, I would have a TiVo boat anchor by now. I bought William von Hagen's ""Hacking the TiVo"" book at the same time as this book. Hagen's book was full of errors and outdated information. Luckily, I am the cautious type and read both books before I started. I don't think William even proof read his work before it was published. Besides giving wrong information on setting up larger disk caches etc. the book was littered with lots of small typos such as mixing up MB with GB etc.I subtracted one star from this book because I feel that the type is too small and the explanations could have been even more detailed and through with more examples such as von Hagen's book. Otherwise, I am very happy with it."
2,Major Disappointment,"I was so excited when Hacking TiVo came to my door. First would be playing with the back door functions. Oops, you have the latest software version 4.01? Sorry, we only have codes up to 3.0. Go search the web and maybe you'll find the new ones. Ok, well I really wanted to use the video extraction function-save programs from the TiVo hard drive and burn them to a disc. Oops, you have a series 2 TiVo? Sorry, everything we discuss in the book deals with series 1. Series 2 have data encryption.My gripe is, as with all advertising, the object naturally is to sell the product. Well, Amazon got my 20 bucks, Mr. Keegan got his share and I'm stuck with a book that tells me nothing that I couldn't find on the web. If the advertising or a review mentioned that the majority of the book dealt with version 1 Tivo's, I could have spent the money on something useful-like 2 months of TiVo service."
2,Series 2 -- DON'T BOTHER!,"Seriously, the only thing this book offers you is Hard Drive replacement instructions. That's not the fault of the author, it's just the way it is. I guess there aren't many hacks for Series 2. I think the author still thinks all the old hacks are still pretty neat, but for someone fairly recent to TiVo (such as myself), it's really just a history lesson I can do without. Most of the hacks described in the book are available to Series two owners anyways (e.g. Home Media Option).What Keegan finally admits ON PAGE 18, is that, ""Series 2 units remain ineligible for most of the hacks in this book."" -- I sure wish it said that on the cover."
2,outdated,The book was new. The information was outdated. It applied to a operating system tivo does not use any more.
1,Not for TIVO Series 2! Only for Series 1,"I ordered this book on the premise that I would research about Tivo and expanding a Tivo's features. ( I don't yet have a Tivo) Much to my suprise on page 18 the author states that much of the info in the book applies ONLY to a Series 1. Further more he does not even state this fact on the cover nor the brief on the back!I am contemplating returning the book. If I were to use the ideas and features of the book I would have to buy a used Tivo from Ebay. Series 1 boxes are not sold anymore. If this book(published in December 2003 but with a 2004 copyright) came out 2-3 years ago, then it would be a best seller.How disappointing!I'm glad I did'nt have to pay shipping on this crap."
2,Obsolete,"Most of the information contained in this book is useless unless you own a model 1 tivo. General information, such as the disk partition structure is absent. Techniques for circumnavigating the bios kernel checking are also not mentioned. In short, save your money and get more current information on the web."
2,Series 1 or Series 2?,"The book seems well written, however it REALLY only pertains to series 1. Many of the hacks for series 2 are forewarned as ""try at you own risk"". Since series 1 are no longer made (unless you scrounge e-bay), most people will be buying the series 2. The majority of these will probably be Direct TV Tivos, which the author states are the most hack proof. The book was probably great when it first came out, but much like the playstation mod chips of a few years back, its obsolete. A newer edition is badly needed."
2,Mainly applicable to the obsolite Type 1 TiVos,"If you have a Type 2 TiVo, this book will not be of much use. Anything you need to accomplish on a Type 2 TiVo can be found on the internet at www.tivocommunity.com.Having noted the above, the book is well laid out and written in an easy to understand fashion. Although I am clearly disappointed that this obsolete book is marketed as though it is relevant to the current generation of TiVos, I would be willing to look at future books by the author."
1,Take exception to one reviewers comments,I haven't read the book yet so I can't comment on the book itself but I do want to point out that I tried the smc2208usb/eth ez connect Usb adaptor on my series 2 and it worked like a charm. No fuss no mess no problem. Tivo recognized it instantly.
2,Very Limited Usefulness,"This really is not a book on Hacking Tivo, rather a book on ""Hacking First Generation Tivo's."" I have a series 2 DVR and expected to see some hacks that would prove worthwhile for my DVR, however there is little for owners of Tivos manufactured in the last two years. Very simple recommendation-if you have a first generation Tivo buy the book, otherwise pass."
1,Not much help for newer TiVo machines.,"The book is great for older model TiVo machines. Type 2 TiVo machines, which are all that are being sold now, are not really dealt with in this book.Save yourself some money and just look up TiVo hacking on the internet if you have a type 2 TiVo."
1,Another disappointed reader...,"Got this book as soon as it came out, and felt like a real schmuck when I realized that it was 99% for the old Series 1 TiVos. I assumed I had just not read the blurb carefully enough. But now I come back and see that about half the reviewers were as deceived as I was. I'm sending it back AND asking Amazon to pay the shipping costs..."
4,It ain't that simple... but still a good book,"I might be advertising myself a moron but this book needed to be a little more simple than it was. Hacking your Tivo isn't that easy. I've been on computers since age six and I built my last two computers but I felt this needed a little dumbing down for me. In upgrading to a larger hard drive I was expecting more of a step by step process for installing another hard drive but instead the author used a lot of technical terms and just assumed everyone would be onboard with him. If ""If you have a B drive in your configuration, connect it to the secondary IDE bus as a slave"" makes perfect sense to you, feel free to buy this book.(...)."
1,Only applies to Series 1,"The hacks in this book generally only apply to Series 1 TiVos, which are no longer made."
5,very girly,I bought every color this shoe came in.I love the cut out hearts on them. So cute and girly .They are comfy and i love peep toes.
3,Cute but not so comfy.,"I got these in ivory in size 7. true to fit. They look cute. But i got blisters as soon as i wore them. I had to get padding for the back, and have to wear bandaids on my big toe. the cute little bow irritates my toe and causes blisters! not that comfy but since i wore them i have to keep them."
1,Manufacturer defect - obivous,Right out of the box there was a mnufacturer's defect that was obvious to anyone taking a casual look. Indicative of very poor quality control. There was an irregular white line arounf the screen behind the glass.
1,Don't Buy X2gen Products,Their web site link for on-line RMAs has been broken for over two weeks. No one answers the phone that is listed on their web site and no one replies to any emails. Please do not ever buy an X2gen product!!!!
4,Yunnan by Patrick Booz,"This book is very useful for planning the trip. For example, the author suggests that the ""bamboo temple"" outside of Kunming is of most interest. It is a bit off the path, and would have been missed if not for this recommendation. The brass drums in the Yunnan Museum are very interesting.I found that almost everything mentioned in the detailed advice about less permanent sites had changed, but then noticed my bookstore had sold me the 1987 edition! There were some amusing discoveries: the restaurant for workers, peasants, and soldiers had been changed to an expensive linen tablecloth place called ""Ambrosia."""
4,So far....So good. Very satisfied.,"I've been using the Uniden UIP1869V Vonage Internet phone system for about a month and have been very satisfied with it. It seems to be a quality desktop phone with good voice quality. The features are easily accessible for the most part. I would prefer a headset jack on the desktop set. I have to use the remote ""cordless"" set in order to use a headset. Although, I found it very easy to transfer calls between the two."
5,Excellent Voip Phone,"I tried the Uniden phone based on a friends recommendation. I had a Linksys PAP2 adapter, which was ok but I had many sound quality issues. I tried several phones with PAP2 and same problems emerged. My wife almost made me drop Vonage. Thankfully, the Uniden works great and has many features that most phones don't. Sound quality is great. The only problem is trying to find one. Your best to try and buy from Vonage direct, but you'll have to start another line and then switch, unless they changed their stupid policy."
2,"Out of date, better options are available now.","5.8GHz phones are out of date. If you haven't tried the new DECT 6.0 phones, you're missing out. They are so much lighter, have superior range, call quality, battery life and no interference.Also, I didn't like having my phone tied to a single voip provider, Vonage.Some better (and cheaper) phone options are the Vtech 1 or 2 line DECT 6.0 phones.And there are even some cordless voip phone systems that can handle 3 or more lines, like the Panasonic KXTGP series and the SNOM M9.Best of all, these phones and more all work with a voip provider (voiSip), who allows multiple lines at no extra charge. Just buy whatever phone system you need, and select a minute plan that fits your usage."
2,Hisses and Scares the Dog,"I bought this from PetsMart for about eight dollars. Even with the water set to the absolute lowest pressure, this thing hisses loudly. I put pillpockets on it to get my dog to drink. He licked it once and ran. I loosened the thread to make it leak and left him out there in the heat for a bit. I think he might have gone to it, but I let him in after ten minutes or so. The water was spraying on the house, so my wife has suggested jamming the device into the open position, so it just runs out the bottom. She's suggested pulling back the ""bead"" with some heavy wire tied to the spout. We could leave it running for like a day or something, with a large bowl under it -- keep water off the house or a muddy pool from forming. We'll give that a try, and see if he will come around. If I ever remember to, I will try to update this comment. Today is June 6, 2011."
1,worthless product,"I bought this for my dog and had trouble getting her to use it. The instructions suggest rubbing it with peanut butter, but she always licked it so delicately that it rarely put out any water. I suppose it is great for a big clunky lab or great dane, but it is worthless for a Chihuahua. Very few products on the market are designed well for small dogs!!!"
5,Waterer,"Good product from Lixit. I have being using since a couple of years, They last long TimeBuen producto lo uso varios años ya, tengo 57 corrales ya que manejo un criadero de perros finosGracias ThanksRené"
5,"So far, So good!","My Yellow Lab and Golden Retriever took to it right away....after the peanut butter trick. I was surprised at how easy it was for them to activate the valve. Either way, if this lasts me a year it will be worth buying another one.Edit: Almost 2 years later and still working great! Also added a Pug to the pack since the original review."
2,Not for newer faucets,"I'm not sure if it's a problem w/ our faucet's style, but we were unable to use this. It was either dripping constantly or not at all. We had to go back to having a large bowl out for our dogs. When it was drippy, they understood how to use it, we just prefer not to have huge puddles in the yard."
3,These used to be great...,We had one for years for our dogs. Worked GREAT! When it finally gave out we bought a new one. It lasted 4 months before it started leaking. Bought another... it lasted about the same. I think they changed the design or the quality of the parts...? Hope you have better luck.
4,Good waterer for dogs/cats,I got this for my two dogs to use and it turns out the cats like it better. Well made and works well. My dogs would just rather use a bowl.
1,Pours water onto the ground.,"I purchased this faucet waterer for my three dogs because they love to play in their water and end up knocking it over everyday so I was constantly having to refill it. When I attached the part onto the faucet and turned it on it immediately started leaking water. Maybe its because my faucet is angled and not pointed straight down but this doesn't work at all. I would have better luck just leaving the faucet on all day for the dogs. Unless you have a faucet that is pointed straight to the ground, I wouldn't recommend buying this, and even in that case, I am not sure if it would work at all."
4,Safe your pet from thirst,"This works great! Just put it on a spigot, turn on the water (we zip-tied it open), and your pets will never thirst again! Not to mention no more cleaning yucky water bowls."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Can't even hook this up to my water faucet! I would send back if it cost more, but it's not worth the shipping!"
2,speaker for electronic piano,"I bought this product for my husband to use with his Yamaha piano. He thought and I agreed that the piano sounded tinny when played without the personal headphones. We called Yamaha to ask for advise to fix the sound. This speaker was recommended by the folks at Yamaha. Well, the piano sounds better through this speaker, it is not as good as it should be. I wouldn't recommend buying it to someone else."
2,Too little spring tension,"I used this kit when one of the contacts brunt out in the original switch. The replacement switch has much lower spring tension than the original. The original switch would snap on and spring tension would hold the switch on until the float dropped to the bottom guide, then water level would have to drop further until the float pushed down on the bottom guide hard enough to pull the switch down to the off position. The pump used to remove 4 to 5 inches of water each cycle.The new switch does not have the tension to hold up the guide rod. Now the pump shuts off as soon as the float drops away from the switch lever. The weight of the guide rod pulls the switch down all by itself and the pump stops too soon. With the new switch only 1 to 2 inches of water is removed each cycle."
4,Decent shield for the money,"Read some reviews about the possibility of these shields cracking so I ordered two. They seem sturdy and flexible enough as long as they aren't handled too rough. When snapping it onto my helmet the snaps needed an excessive amount of force to snap into place but since I am not planning on taking it off unless I replace it, not a big deal for me. I love that it has the three extra snaps on the top portion so I was able to reinstall the visor. It is a much nicer riding experience not having the bugs hitting me in the face. Would definitely buy this again in the future if I need it."
2,Cracked in half immediately,"Two days after I purchased it the shield cracked in half immediately. I gave it two stars instead of one because perhaps if you store in completely flat when not in use then it might last longer. It broke when I was attempting to bend it to store inside my sissybar bag when not in use. I don't feel I bent it past what it normally would experience on the helmet. I ended up buying a flip-up, prebent face shield for a little more money. No problems with that one."
5,Worth every penny!,"This hair dryer is amazing. I've used cheap dryers for years, and after using the Bio Ionic for the first time I noticed a difference immediately. My hair can be very frizzy and dry, and conventional dryers only made it worse. But the Bio Ionic made my hair shiny and soft, which is great since I'm trying to grow it out. This professional hair dryer is the secret to salon-healthy hair. I'll never go back to cheap dryers again.When I was shopping around I considered the T3 Tourmaline, but it didn't get good reviews, and doesn't come with a warranty if you purchase it from an unauthorized dealer. The Bio Ionic, however, comes with a 5-year warranty. And the filters are removable for cleaning, which will no doubt extend the life of the dryer. So I highly recommend this product."
5,wow! amazing!,"I bought this hair dryer after receiving a recommendation from my hair stylist. Previously I used a cheap dryer from Target and decided it was time to splurge. All I can say is wow, this dryer is incredible! It leaves my hair almost perfectly straight, probably 10 times less frizzy as it was with my old dryer. All the reviews are spot on. I would highly recommend this dryer."
5,very happy,This is my second Whisper Light and I love them. The first one lasted about 12 years and still works other then the on off switch. I am a professional so unplugging and plugging in was not a great option. So needed to get a new one. And at what a great price and fast shipping...Thx
5,"Wow, does it's job!","The best blow dryer that I've ever owned! I got this for a christmas present, and no longer use any other blow dryer then this one. I also have the ismooth, and I love the results, nice and shiny and I do have body with it. My only issue is the oil on my fingers rubbed off the black letters *cool, warm, etc.* so I just know to use the warm *middle notch* and then press the button for cool when I use it. Other then that, it's awesome!"
3,No accessories?,"I was severely under the impression that this case would come with the accessories that is shown on the inside of the case in the picture. The picture shows 15 accessories that come with the case and nowhere in the description does it say any different. I honestly believe that the picture needs to be altered in some way so as to not mislead any potential customer. All that being said it is a strong, durable case that will serve it's purpose well. I have already received several compliments on the quality of the case and on it's functionality."
5,Informative & emotional,"I bought this video because I was interested in how this subject would be tackled. I have 2 boys, both of whom have not been circumcised. I am very proud of my decision to not put them through a painful & unnecessary surgery. What I love most about this video is that the filmmaker is Jewish. His father performs circumcisions! Even he realizes, despite his upbringing, that mutilation to baby boys is wrong & inhumane...just as it is to baby girls! The film not only shows the emotion involved with the decision to circumcise or not, but also shows the actual surgery and covers the anatomy of what is being removed from a boy's body during the procedure. It is a fair showing of both viewpoints, for and against, but in the end, you cannot deny that circumcision is a barbaric and unnatural procedure!"
5,Superb work!,"""Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion."" -Oscar Wilde""The first and great commandment is, Don't let them scare you."" Elmer Davis"
1,A horror,Bile will rise in your throat reading this drivel.Makes Christopher Paolini look like Shakespeare.
3,Will The Madness Ever End?,"There are far too many books written about spousal abuse. Our community needs to take a look at this serious subject and come up with an answer. This book depicts abuse and a case of unlawful imprisonment, which is a good story to tell that has not been told. I applaud the author for being bold in writing about this subject matter. I also recommend this book called ""LUST OF THE FLESH."" This is yet another excellent story that has never been told in its fashion."
5,As far as I can remember...,"...this was one of the scariest books that I read at the time. I still have the book, and have re-read it only a few years ago. The gargoyle is what scared me the most; anyone who reads this will see why I say this. This is like a combination of ""The Shining"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say, read this book. It is very, very short, and one can finish it in one sitting. Don't get too scared though..."
5,Put your back against the wall & get ready for a scary ride!,"What a great horror story! No, it's not gross, not bloody, not overtly spooky, and the Terminator does not make an appearance, but Westall's subtle writing and build up of true horror make for a literally hair raising read. I read ""Stones..."" as an adult, that means I was over 30 folks, while between ""real"" jobs and while working at a children's bookstore. I took this with me to lunch and was glad I had my back to the wall, even at that I kept looking over my shoulder... Not for under 12, but a great scare! ...Enjoy and read read read!"
5,"""Thrilling and sophisticated study""","Paz presents in this work wonderful insights about love and eros in modern life. From the antiquity to the modern period, he studies the themes from the literary and philosophical aspects.He takes up Plato's discussion about the love of beauty, India's Kama Sutra, the role of the Troubadours in Provence, the courtly Love, the medieval Love, Dante, Freud's modern psychology, etc.Paz emphasizes that love and eros are spiritual and give meaning to our lives and civilizations.The writing is very enjoyable, thought-provoking and wise."
3,ENIGMATIC,"A powerful tale of life, love , perplexing yet unifying emotions in beings from different times and different cultures. Masterful. A must read."
4,A wonderful experience,"This book is really a compound of reference material for the serious wine collector, but it is clothed in a history and travel book which is the next best thing to being in this wonderful wine region. Photographs take full advantage of this photogenic region."
2,Langhe Atlas,Fantastic aerial photos of the area give a good impression of what the Lange is like. Unfortunately map work is fair at best with NO SCALES!
3,not too bad but not that good,"I am a little disappointed by this book... maybe I had bigger expectations than I should... this for the moment, later on I might upgrade my judgement/opinion. I am sure later on this book could be more useful.I feel this book could improve if some non Italian would write the initial few chapters and introduce the terroirs and its wines in a more didactical way.I hope I will have time to get back here and add further comments as soon as I will complete reading this."
3,Not all videos avaliable,"The videos are : blame it on the rain, baby don't forget my number, girl you know is true,girl i'm gonna miss you, no more, and the sound is not excellente is aceptable....don't forget is a vhs, i wanna like all the video but worse nothing.."
2,Finish does not hold up,"I purchased this table a year ago. It is exactly the right size for the space I have, and the color, black, is exactly what I wanted. However, the finish has not held up at all. I always put something under hot items to protect the finish on tables that we eat on. I use thick foam place mats under plates. This finish is so sensitive that, even with the place mats, white rings have developed where we eat. This problem is so bad that the place where I put a pizza, in its delivery box, has a white ring. I would not recommend purchasing this as a dining table."
2,Probably wouldn't recommend it,I purchased the table about 2 months ago and it came about 2 weeks after I purchased it. When I opened up the box the 3 corners of the table were smashed in and the table was more on the yellow side of antique. I also purchased the chairs from a different website and they were ship really fast and came undamaged. They were definitely more on the white side. I returned the table and asked for an exchange and they said it will take 2-4 weeks to get here. It has now been 3 weeks and still no table. Think I might just get a refund after all this. Not too happy with the wait.
2,Should be more specific,"I guess it was my fault, but I just assumed that it included chairs, simply because it shows them in the picture and does not say anywhere that they are not included. Most of the ones that have chairs in the photo ""just for looks"" say that they are sold seperately. This one does not."
3,An averaged rating,"What I mean by ""averaged rating"" is that I've taken the five stars the show warrants and averaged it in with the miserable rating the packaging merits. Oh, sure...it's stunning and some genius spent lots of time at his computer coming up with the design. But face it: it's a pain in the proverbial butt, opening it to get at the discs and then reassembling all the components to close it when you put it back on the shelf...assuming you have enough shelf space to hold this turkey. What I plan on doing is buying several DVD sleeves and storing the discs in them, leaving the box and the heart-shaped top and the plastic cover, etc., in storage somewhere. (Can you imagine the complete AMOS & ANDY series, if it ever got packaged, having something similar? I can just picture Andy's derby or the Kingfish's fedora or Andy's cabbie cap...maybe all three...in a flip-top box. But the Guardians of Blackness will never permit that show to be packaged and sold, despite its brilliance.)"
1,carton had fallen apart,I tried 1 CD and had a heck fo a time starting it.now the whole thing is just sitting there
1,Scratched Discs,"This is NOT a review of the content (TV shows), but of the packaging that results in the DVD discs being scratched. The fragile optical discs are stored in folders, instead of being suspended in a stationary position. When the discs are placed in the folders at the manufacturing plant the discs are scratched. When the box set is shipped, the two folders holding the discs move in all directions, as do the discs. The friction between the two result in scratching of the fragile optical side of the DVD.What you should receive from the studio is pristine DVDs, not scratched discs that you will receive.Even if you are willing to accept the above, you should obtain individual DVD cases to store the DVDs.I cannot recommend the purchase of a ""NEW"" I Love Lucy: The Complete Series. Suggestion, purchase a ""used"" set, which will cost less and look the same."
5,Who does NOT love Lucy?,"Absolutely fantastic product. Not only does it include the entire TV series including Lucy-Desi comedy hour episodes, but every disk has fascinating extras: the old openings and closings, transitions between scenes, commercials from companies that sponsored the show. DVDs even include Philip Morris commercials: while I, of course, do not support tobacco advertising, watching the old cigarette ads helps re-create the era of the 1950's. Every DVD also features episodes of Lucy's radio show ""My dear husband,"" which later became ""I love Lucy.""Whether you are a Lucy aficionado is not important: this DVD set will provide hours of pure fun for anyone!!!"
5,Just the funniest ever,ALL THE FAMILY loved this show and watched every episode together and the laughs are there in every episode. Do yourself a favour and buy this series.
5,Great!,Product was in perfect shape and came quickly. Great price and we have enjoyed watching from the first season. Good for lots of laughs for the young and the old.
5,You won't be sorry,"Even if you are not an ""I Love Lucy"" fan you will not be sorry to buy the complete series. It is excellent with a bonus DVD. It's Lucy at her best and you can enjoy without a cuts or commercials. The best TV show of all-time is pure gold. If you want a good laugh you can't go wrong with Lucy."
5,I Love Lucy (Complete Series),This is a great set for I Love Lucy fans! It's just like watching it when I was growing up...the picture is very clear and the sound is good too.
5,I LOVE i love lucy!,"I am so happy to finally own the complete series of I Love Lucy. I have been a fan for as long as I can remember, and this set reminds me why. It includes the episodes from all 9 seasons, including all of the Lucy Desi Comedy hours. It's also packed with lots of extras. I recommend these DVDs to any Lucy fan out there!"
5,Pure classic,"I can;t say much that others haven't already. I love Lucy was one of the best shows on television, and is a breath of fresh air amongst the dreck that passes for television nowadays. There's lots of laugh-out-loud moments, along with sentimental and serious ones. No gratuitous violence, no valueless profanity, no pointless sex scenes, no nothing. So many TV shows today employ violence, sex, and profanity to 'spice' things up or 'push the envelope', but Lucy had none of these. This show is rather clean - some would consider 'clean' boring, but this show was great, creative, and funny - it focused on good things we could all enjoy."
5,Shannon,I absolutely Love I Love Lucy! This is wonderful! It comes with a booklet and each episode is labeled. I looked everywhere for this and couldn't find it except Barnes and Noble where wait for it... Would have coat me $275.00!!!!Then I amazoned duh should have in the first place.
5,Great purchase,"This complete series if a MUST HAVE. Now, I can take my DVD player anywhere with my LUCY tapes and I am in heaven. Thanks for offering them."
2,Two of the same disks... missing one completely!!!!!!!!!!!!,My boxed set has TWO Season Two Disk 1 and NO Season One Disk 6!!! They are back to back in the packaging - someone goofed!!! :<<<
4,"Gift, not for me","I don't really care about show itself,the product is a gift and not for me. I will say, however, that this product is in a very nice display box and I received the package 2 days before it was estimated I would get it. Very happy with Amazon since switching to Prime."
4,Great product. . . TERRIBLE packaging!,"The product is great and priced very well for what you get. . .the complete series of I Love Lucy, one of the greatest shows of all time, but it is packaged horribly, in accordian style books that make the DVD's very easy to scratch. I would suggest purchasing covers to prevent them from scratching. Other than that. . . great buy and investment!"
5,Best Buy Ever!!!!,"Tell everyone you know that is an I Love Lucy fan!!! Bonus clips, so many shows, so many dvds! See the sequence that made this couple an all american family show for decades!"
5,I Love Lucy and I love this Collection!!,"What can I say? It is afterall, ""I Love Lucy""...good pricing for the whole collection!!!! Lowest pricing I found anywhere!!!"
3,"I LOVE Lucy, but not the packaging!","I Love Lucy the show itself gets 5 stars. The packaging for this set doesn't rate as high. While its nice to get every episode in one set (not to mention all the bonus material) the way its stored is not so great. On the outside its very attractive, but open it up and its a different story. First the heart shaped lid doesn't attach very well, then the discs are all stored in two fan accordian like holders that make it difficult to get the discs out of. The booklet that comes with it is a nice addition though. Even though the packaging isn't the best I think you can't go wrong getting every single hilarious episode ever made, even the Lucy Desi Comedy Hour shows are included. So overall I'm willing to overlook the poor packaging in order to enjoy this classic show."
5,I Love Lucy Too!,"I liked this set when I bought it, it's very nice and I really love the show. If you're not too set on paying the price then try looking for it on another shopping site. I sold my set like this on ebay for $45 and it was in mint condtion. This is a great set to have."
5,Great Set,"It's nice to watch good clean comedy. I just wish it didn't come in the funky heart box since it now won't fit into our DVD cabinet. If you love comedy, this is a great addition to add to your collection."
1,Money grubbing studios,"The much sought after I Love Lucy movie is going to be included in this new set, so if you want it, you need to buy this set."
5,Gotta love I Love Lucy,"We don't have any of the other box sets of any of the series, so were thrilled that they came out with the complete set plus the extras. My only complaint here is with Amazon, I found it way cheaper elsewhere, $40 cheaper. Surprising as Amazon is usually the most competitively priced to say the least."
1,Wait For HD Blu-Ray,"The only way CBS is going to release Lucy on Blu-Ray is for people to stop buying the DVDs.The difference in quality is staggering. Go to CBS.com and check out streaming of complete episodes in HD for free. You will never settle for DVD again!!Desi's decision to shoot this series on film makes these gems as impressive today as anything else you could buy, and viewable in a way no one has ever seen them.Vote with your wallet!"
1,Not a new product,Purchased as a gift. The description said it was brand new but when they received it the package was open the I love Lucy box was broken and clearly used . Awful experience
1,Why do the studios do this to us?,I purchased every season set of I Love Lucy and now I see this AND there are extras that I want but will have to spend another $220 just for one DVD. Why can't the studios offer the extra features (and the collectors box) to all those who have already purchased the season prior. Am I the only one pissed off by this?
5,Still a classic,I have a big fan of the show and the box set and its price was a must have purchase.
5,awesome,This collection is so great! We watched almost the entire collection while remodeling a house. Was so nice to have the comedy while working so hard. I got this on a Deal of the Day and the price can't be beat! Lucy was the BEST!!!
5,wonderful evocation of chinese american childhood,"really enjoyed this chapter book, and can't wait to read it to my daughter. simply and warmly told."
2,Boring Read,"This book was a big disappointment. The story was mediocre and the writing was horrible. It could have been written by a 10 year old. The plot was intriguing at the beginning, then became dull and predictable."
1,Dull,"This book was so dull that I couldn't finish it. There was no hook, no adversity for the protagonist, and the story was dull. The writing is average at best. I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't."
4,Above average.,"It's the usual story, but especially well done. He is the magnificently handsome Marquess of Warwick who's bored with all the easy conquests. She is Gwendolyn Tarrant, a stunningly beautiful young widow who is virtuous. He wants her for his mistress, of course she'll settle for nothing less than marriage. I'll be on the look out for other books by this author."
5,Oh! My! Goodness!,"I can't tell you exactly how the author did it, but I was on the edge of my seat for this whole book from beginning to end. Lea Webster is being stalked by her exhusband who is a cop. Imagine your worst nightmare of a cop abusing his position and you have this guy. Creepy, mostly because this is one of those ripped from the headlines kind of story. The hero lives next door and he's just gotten out of prison. I felt like I knew these two people from the minute they stepped off the page. They aren't supposed to fall in love, but you know they are going to, and you know the fall out is going to be huge.As worried as I was about the outcome, you might be thinking this story is going to be depressing. Trust me it's not, it's inspiring and uplifting and satisfying.Another wonderful book from sharon Mignrey. I'm looking for the next one."
5,Characters you'll fall in love with,"From the first pages through to the exciting climax, I was rooting for Lea, a woman trying to distance herself from an abusive and increasingly-frightening ex-husband -- a decorated local cop--, and Zach MacKenzie, an ex-convict struggling to stay on the straight and narrow. Ms. Mignerey drew me into the story quickly and kept me reading well past bedtime to see how this star-crossed couple could possibly get together.Highly recommended!"
5,Children's delights.,Another enjoyable book from Dick King Smith; terrific author of children's books about animals with human qualities; most enjoyable.
1,Spare me,"Our five year old got this as a birthday present and loved it ... for about 15 minutes. At that point one of the pins kept popping up after it was re set and then it kept resetting itself after every throw, so that you couldn't have two throws to get the pins down. Sounds good, looks good, but it just isn't built to work correctly after a few throws. Very disappointing."
1,A bit shoddy,"Boy oh boy were the boys excited to get this. They love Dora. Helping me set it up we broke a support piece when it got stepped on - but it still set up in decent condition.Then I installed the batteries and it worked fine for 4 bowls, then the motor whirred horribly and the pins had trouble resetting.Instructions say turn it off then on, so I did that and it worked for another toss. Then loud whirring again, then when I turned it on again one of the pins refused to stay set.The concept of this toy is excellent. The materials and robustness of construction do not lend themselves to play by active boys.Customer service by moose mountain over email seemed helpful, but I haven't gotten the problem fixed yet."
5,Quality Shoe,This shoe is a jewel and fits like it was made for my foot. It is a quality shoe and I feel like I got it at a steal! I will be on the lookout for more of this brand
4,Second time around,"If your an avid Blondie fan and/or DVD collector, then chances are you already own this DVD.This is the same performance from the Beat Club (AKA. Musik Laden) that was released several years ago with a different cover and title: ""The Best of the Beat Club live: Blondie""Not the their best performance on DVD but great if your looking into early Blondie in their pre-hits era.This DVD contains a few visually enternaining numbers...the music is pretty good considering Blondie weren't considered the best band live but they play it up in this one.Very dated at almost 30 years ago but the sound and picture is exellent. From January 1978 supportign their Plastic Letters album that came out the next month.So if your looking to fill your collection get it!"
3,Yet another copy of Blondie: The Best of MusikLaden Live,"Do not bother to buy this DVD if you already have a DVD copy of Blondie's concert for German Radio Bremen MusikLaden Live. If you can find the original: ""Blondie: the best of MusikLaden Live"" 1999, EME America/Pioneer Artists. It is just a repackaging of the same concert available on several DVD releases."
5,I love this DVD,The presentation is very clear. The performance is excellent. Very energetic and Debra Harry performs with verve. I wish it was an hour longer!
4,EXCELLENT 1978 VINTAGE BLONDIE PERFORMING ON A GERMAN TV SHOW!!! (DVD),"This is a great DVD of ""early"" Blondie. Debbie is fantastic, and so is the band. This dvd contains some of their early songs. Debbie is a fantastic performer, and this dvd proves it!!! I just wish it was longer, but anything from Blondie is great!!! The approx. run time is only about 30 minutes or so, but every minute is very good. If you like Blondie, you'll like this DVD. Thanks!!!"
4,Wobbler - Massive Modern Symphonic Progressive Rock From Norway,"Wobbler is a progressive rock band from Norway who specialize in long epic 70's style prog. There are only 4 tracks on this disc that clocks in at well over an hour. The band remind me a lot of Anglagard in many ways. The compositions are lush, long and intricate. They take the influence of 70's era progressive rock updated for a modern era. They pretty much stick to the symphonic elements without any metal leanings or pop song craft. This may or may not be a good thing depending on your perspective. This album got a lot of hype in the progressive rock press when it came out and although I think it is good, it does not quite live up to what I was expecting. This is one of those albums that some people will love and some find rather ho hum. I lie somewhere in the middle."
3,Competent but not epic,"Mildly noticeable modern progressive rock release humbly tries to bring the dated genre up to speed with some more current influence, but still bites off more then they can chew. I particularly like the final track, though the centerpiece of a near half hour track tends to drag with insignificance."
2,Disappointing!,"Pretty much forgettable/unmemorable attempt at the classic prog rock sound. The title track which clocks in at almost 28 minutes, I believe, is about 26 or 27 minutes too long, and the vocals - well lets just say they don't add anything and leave it at that. For the entire CD, little or no imagination is demonstrated whatsoever - the songs are basically just boring, pretty lethargic sounding - to my ear anyway. I thought maybe I was just missing something so I gave the CD two or three listens, but still nothing. Hopefully their subsequent two releases are improved over this first one (but I'll never know as I have no intent on purchasing them after hearing this first one)."
2,"Great band, last dregs","Come was the most underappreciated band of the 1990s -- their first three records are all knockouts. The songwriting energy goes in interesting new directions on this record -- the mellow, contemplative ""The Former Model"" seems like a pose, but ""Recidivist"" and ""Silk City"" were the last great songs Come wrote. The rest of it is rote rock -- while ""Stomp"" is a passable Aerosmith rip-off, elsewhere, as in ""Saints Around My Neck"" and ""One Piece,"" the pained drama isn't earned. Go get ""Eleven:Eleven"" or ""Near Life Experience"" -- both frightfully good records. Leave this one in the bin."
1,Am I missing something?,"After reading Carrie Pilby and thoroughly enjoying it, I looked forward to Ms. Lissner's next book. That is why I was so sorely disappointed by this lame attempt. The characters are shallow, unlikeable and dim-witted. It doesn't seem as if Ms. Lissner has ever been in the dating world. Heck, it doesn't even seem like she has ever been in an actual social situation. Get this one at the library or bypass it altogether."
4,A great Red Dress Ink Book,"""Starting from Square two"" tell the story of Gert Healy, who after the death of her husband she finds herself back on the dating scene with the help of her two friends Hallie and Erica. While out with her friends, Gert meets Todd. As Todd and Gert being to date, she tries to figure out to tell Todd that she has been married before.This was one of the best Red Dress Ink that I have read so far, this book was a grown-up that dealt with real emotions. The only reason that I give it five stars is that Erica was to over the top. But don't let that stop you, this is a really good book."
4,Very smart chick-lit!,"I like women's fiction that's smart, insightful and thought-provoking as well as witty, sassy and fun. Starting from Square Two has all of those elements. It was refreshing to read about takes on the dating world from a young widow's point of view. It's been over a year since Gert's husband's fatal car accident, which is why her friends feel it's time Gert starts dating again. But what does Gert know about dating and men? After all, she got married right after college. Although it seems that her friends don't know much about dating and men either. They're still single, aren't they?I laughed and nodded in agreement at Caren Lissner's deep character study. Her takes on dating are right on the money. And she added wit and lightness to an otherwise serious subject matter. I loved Carrie Pilby, Lissner's first novel, and her second effort is even better! This is the best Red Dress Ink offering thus far this year. Highly recommended..."
3,Not bad,"Normally I love Red Dress Books. I have high expectations for a humorous read. That being said, the book is sweet, but not what you usually get from Red Dress.The characters are all simply nice people, without the usual personaligy quirks the books usually contain. The heroine is a bit sad, and you hope for her eventual happiness, but there isn't really anything that endears the reader to her or makes you identify with her...and I always tend to identify with Red Dress characters.Over all...a good read, just not quite up to expectations."
4,Another great one by Red Dress Ink,This book was very touching. If you have ever loved anyone it touches you and make the book very believable and relatable. I found myself laughing and crying at the memories that Gert has through the book. I loved how along with the seriousness of her own tragedy she manages to get into funny situations with Halie and Erika. Red Dress Ink has turned up to be a great find and I can't wait for more :)
3,Goal in life -- a man,"I loved Carrie Pilby, and had high expectations for this book. Although it does deal with a number of weighty subplots, including Gert's grieving and her frustrating work situation, it was tiresome to hear about how dating and catching a man are the goal in a girl's life. Not only Gert, but all the main female characters seemed to have very little interest in living their own lives. Instead, they were obsessed with men, whether they had them or not. It was perhaps worth a quick read, but not the top of my list."
4,On being an Alien,"Voyager in Night takes you inside the personality, inside the world view, inside the feelings of an utterly alien computer program.These stories develop the same combination of shock, revulsion and empthy as the protagonist journeys from something like human to something very different. Cuckoo's Egg resonates with Pyanfar Chanur, in that the protagonist starts as an Alien. Who we come to admire and respect.Serpent's reach, the protagonist starts out fairly human. As in Voyager, the destination is immortality and a hive mind. Essential Cherryh!"
4,A clear understanding of nonlinear optics,This is a great book to understand the nonlinear processes of frequency conversion of light. The derivation of the formulas are pretty clear. My only complaint is that it didn't discuss periodically poled crystals but I haven't found any books that covers it. Fortunally I was able to understand the material in Boyd's book to figure out how these crystals do frequency conversion on my own.
4,A book instrumental in teaching nonlinear optics,I have found this book to be quite useful in my quest to understand nonlinear optics. It gives a thorough explanation of the fundamental priciples and even gives a few examples to aid in the learning of the subject.A very good text for graduate and undergraduate students.
4,nice,I think this is one the best books in this field. the contents are good and the quality of papers is also good.
5,Must have,"If you are working in NLO, you simply have to have this book on your book-shelf. There's nothing to compare with it for the fundamentals, to gain a clear understanding of many different NLO processes."
3,dragnet,"The book is very good, however the condition of the book is poor. Every time you turn a page the page falls out. I have enjoyed reading it but will have to trow it away by the time I finish it.It is about a person or group of people, I have not finnished yet, that are safe crackers and are armed and dangerous; expecially to the cops. Joe and Frank are the detectives assigned to the case and you are always wanting to know what their next lead will be and what it might lead to."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM,"I don't know why they haven't taken this item down yet, but you will NOT receive what is advertised on this page. You'll get a 1 meter version of the item in the picture."
2,Good book but needs more breeds.,"Half of this book was introduction. Although the introduction was very informational, There was too much. And it's true, they did leave out the Munchkin,Bengal,and there were a few more. I just can't remember them at this moment. This was a very good book though. I just don't recommend it to anyone who is tring to decide what breed they want."
3,"Okay book but,","I think this book was okay but it has more introduction than breeds. It also left out a few breeds like the Munchkin,Bengal and more. If you don't mind having a few breeds missing than this is an okay book."
2,not my favorite book,"I find it very difficult to enjoy reading a book when I cannot sympathize with the protagonist. Kasey Ellis struck me as an incredibly self-involved, selfish, immature coward. The suspense was not suspenseful; was more boring filler. The romance was trite and not believable. Tanner Hart should have cut his losses and found someone with a little backbone. Kasey's relationship with her son was clingy (on her part). I felt sorry for her son. He admirably kept patience with his whiny mother. The only reason I gave this book two stars is because I was able to finish it. It wasn't so bad that I gave up on it."
2,Politics makes strange bedfellows,"I don't know where to start to describe the truly unbelievable stories in this book. First how dumb was Kasey's late husband Mark that he accepted the fact she was pregnant and still married her? His first suspect should have been his friend he asked to take her to the party, duh. Then there were the little attention grabbing headlines in the the daily news that everyone took as gospel and jumped on the accusation bandwagon. I guess I've just lead a sheltered life, compared to what transpired in these characters everyday lives. Oh well it's just fiction, right?"
1,"Bad, bad, bad....","I'm amazed this book was ever published. Did an editor even look at it? The writing is bad, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the plot jumps all over the place. The blurb on the back of the book indicates the book is set in Tyler, Texas and yet the town is called Rushmore in the book. Don't waste your money!!"
4,A 'Killer' Guilty Pleasure,"Killer Workout is a late 80's slasher movie that's so bad it's good. There aren't many movies that I would call ""so bad it's good"", but this is one of them. This is by no means a great movie. There's pretty much zero character development and most of the deaths scenes are either really dark or occur offscreen. However, there's so much cheese contained in this movie that all is forgiven.If you're a fan of cheesy direct-to-video slasher movies like Slumber Party Massacre 2, Sleepaway Camp 2, and Cheerleader Camp, then you should give Killer Workout a watch if you can find it."
1,Skip it.,"Ok guys and horror fans, I love Linea Quigley just as much as the next guy. But please, please, please....skip this one. Don't rent it, if it's on TV, change the channel. It's not worth even five minutes....seriously....it isn't. :("
5,Really good!,"I have become a big fan of Guided By Voices in the past year, and I just recently discovered this Tobin Sprout album. If you like GBV, I'm sure you'll like this, too."
3,Very consistent Sprouting,"3 1/2 stars. I am a fan of Tobin Sprout, have his first record and most of the GBV stuff. The nice thing about GBV with Sprout is that since he only got a few chances, his best stuff probably got showcased--not to mention it was a great complement to Bob Pollard's material, standing out as a brighter contrast. Now that he has branched out, Sprout is growing as a songwriter and performer, and his material is consistently good. Not great. I've listened to both his solo records for quite some time, and have thoroughly enjoyed them. I like the plaintive melancholy of his sound, and his forays on piano. I just can't think of a memorable moment a la ""14 Cheerleader Coldfront,"" ""Little Whirl,"" ""To Remake the Young Flyer."" Hey, I'm not saying this stuff is bad--but I think Toby still needs to prove a little more depth to his writing; maybe more instrumentation instead of just going through the piano and guitar chord changes. Looking forward to his new work."
5,Very cute teaspoons,"These little spoons are so cute. My friends were with me a few days ago for a meeting and I served tea after the meeting. When they saw the spoons, they were all like little girls at a tea party. In fact, they all wanted some of their own. I love the spoons and my grandchildren will each want one to go with their own special teacups!"
1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed with these teaspoons. I thought they were made in England. They are very light and cheaply made. They are definitely not worth the money!
2,Poor quality,"As an actual, living, breathing, PRACTICING, patternmaker of the non-computer, non-automated variety I was quite disappointed with this book. It appears to be reprinted from absolutely awful photocopies. Smeared text and faded, blurred or otherwise unreadable drawings and diagrams make this a non starter. If you're looking for texts of useful, pre-computer, pre-CAD patternmaking and/or foundry information seek out old, used copies. I have several and even pre WW II copies can be found in very good condition for cheap. This publication may be well intentioned, but it fails miserably in execution."
2,you get what you pay for,"This pump is ok for very light duty use and the price is cheap, but the trick to getting it to work is to use a very short length of tubing or hose at the inlet end. No hose or tubing is supplied with the pump, so you'll have to buy this separately. The pump did not work for me with a 10 foot garden hose, but it worked ok with a 4 foot hose or a short piece of the right sized tubing.The vendor shipped the product very quickly, but failed to respond to my e-mail about the problems I had getting it to work."
2,Nice travel book,"Book has some info, but not much in the way of specifics. A general travel book,not really a fishing book. Very disappointed."
5,The Shaughnessey Accord,I loved and thoroughly enjoyed this book. So much so that I am looking forward to reading the whole series.
3,Bianchin's Books are all the same,"This book is an entertaining read, but contains no surprises.Manolo is the typical arrogant multinational businessman. Ariane is a Helen Bianchin heroine being stalked by her ex-husband. Manolo's baby daughter is the only difference. The parts of the book that deal with the relationship between this couple and the daughter are well drawn. However, the heroine is a bit too much of a victim for me. Part of the charm of this author is that her books contain no surprises which make it relaxing and fun read. Enjoy!"
4,Saw this film firstly on TV and it really stuck in my mind,"Was very happy when it was finally released on DVD by Amazon. Have watched it many times and have become an admirer of Oskar Werner's work. The film does have some flaws in the script and Barbara Ferris is not always emotionally believable and I put that down to direction of a scene not necessarily her acting, but I am a sucker for a good love story. The music especially in the opening credits is hauntingly beautiful and I have also purchased from Amazon, the Timi Yuro CD with that particular track on it. The main theme is also beautiful."
2,a waste of time and money,"I felt this book was laboriously slow to read to my daughter, and she lost interest fast. My 3rd and 4th grade kids called it ""too baby-ish."" I personally felt it was written poorly. It was too long of a book for too simple of a subject matter. In my opinion, it is not worth the money."
1,Impenetrable and Bizarre,"... It's a murky, rambling, frustrating book. Though I suppose it might appeal to some people who can put up its dense style, keep in mind it's certainly not an easy read.Besides the style, the content is also bizarre. As a religious Jew myself, I expected to identify with this book. Nothing could be further from the truth. The characters are obsessive-compulsive, unhappy and fanatical, and Judaism's appeal to the main character seems to be in providing a set of rules and prayers with which she can torture herself. The book's religious references seemed arbitrary to me - Govrin quotes a mish-mash of Jewish prayers at random - and her description of one of the rabbis goes totally against traditional Judaism. (Govrin doesn't seem to have a problem only with Orthodox Jews: her secular characters are equally odd and unbelievable.)I can't believe this book won the Israel Prize - ... I also wonder if this translation is off."
2,won't run,"I can't get this game to run on my computer. It is having display issues. It's either too large, cutting things off, or things are just plain invisible. I've tried re-installing twice. MOOII is my absolute favorite game, and I had high hopes for this one."
1,Junk ...,"Don't buy this game ... The design is horrible ... It's almost a fraud to release a game in this shape ... You don't understand what is happening, the game play itself and there's no enjoyement. It's strategy game where cause - effect relations are unclear ...MOO1 and MOO2 were clearly better than this trash."
1,Master of Orion 3,Pretty much the same as the original MOO that I bought. However it has no controls over ships that I can find. I build SCOUTs and can not seperate them from Defensive Fleets to send them to Scout any Planets. I can not tell FLEETs to go anywhere. VERY VERY poor command structure built into this game.
1,Worst follow-up game ever.,"Like most of the other reviewers, I'm a long-time MOO fan. I keep Win98 box around just so I can keep playing MOO2.Do not buy MOO3. All the fun stuff from MOO2 is either missing or buried so deep in the UI that I can't find it. The gameplay is neither compelling nor addictive.Playing MOO3 felt a lot like doing income tax - lots of nicky-picky details you can't ignore, hunting for the right forms to fill out, and sparse documentation telling you to do things that don't look right after you do them.A huge disappointment - save yourself the heartache and do not purchase this product."
3,A Real Thinker...,"While this game does not offer any actual eye candy whatsoever, it does offer a bit more for the intellectually inclined. Granted, the A.I. can often be quirky and illogical (declaring war, sending word of improved relations, congradulating you for something that you don't know, etc. without any reason). But I do find that the game seems to have an addictive effect. Often I find myself playing for hours (it even has its own built-in alarm clock system to notify the gamer that his or her life is passing without him). I really do not recommend this game to those that rely on graphics to ensure their enjoyment because this game has none, but I would recommend that someone with LOTS of time to kill and a liking for strategy turn based gaming to at least give it a try. Maybe check out a friend who owns it and plan on spending a night or two, or three..."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"What a complete waste of time and money. Even with the patch applied, this game is terrible. It's boring, the AI stinks, the graphics are terrible, and the fun parts of the game have been abstracted (particularly the space combat) while the boring parts of the game, including economic management, have been expanded on. It makes no sense. It's as though they were intentionally trying to make the game boring and dull. If I was on the design team for this game, I'd be ashamed.One and a half stars. That speaks for itself. Do not buy this game."
1,Unable to use,I was unable to use or play this game. It did not work. I am unsure if it was my operating system and never contacted the seller to see if that was the cause or not.
1,Bad,I really feel the could be so much better. The graphics are not great. I have played much more entertaining games but it is what it is. Some people like it. It just isn't for me.
1,What a disappointment.,"If you bother to read many of the reviews about this game, you would have come to the same conclusion as I have. I just wish that I hadn't spend my allowance on this game.After visiting Atari's website and learning that there were repeated changes to the developers and publishers, it is not surprising that this is as bad as it is. Don't buy this game, it'll spare you the pain of dealing with a flawed design, terrible interface, lack of feedback, non existent documentation and outstanding bugs and problems that will never be fixed because there QSI will not patch this game."
1,Back to moo2,"If anything this game got me reHooked on Master of Orion 2. This game just sits there and plays it's self and that makes it boring, very boring. Any chance we can get a Master of Orion 4 that is based on the aspects that made this line of games fun and popular instead of something new?"
1,What a Letdown,"Nothing like MOO2. This game is clunky, takes forever, and is, to be blunt, terribly boring. There are some good ideas, but they got too complicated with everything, and it's not fun to play. The only way I'd recommend trying this game is if you can get it extremely cheap (try eBay). My guess? You'll play it once or twice, and give up. UGH."
2,A Wonderful Legacy of a Title That Fell Short,"An excellent game idea. I played the first and fell in love with it way back when. This newest version though is a big disappointment. It doesn't have hardly any of the original style that made the first so fun and the interface on this one is *HORRIBLE*. There is no real hand-held manual for such a complicated game, only in-game and that is vague at best. Learning how to do something as eventually vital as build a fleet in order to defend or invade is hilariously ridiculous. At the time this series began, it was close to the only one like it and easily worth it, but it's clear they've lost the magic and the point with this one. Pass it by."
1,Only evil people should be punishment by playing this game!,"playing this game is similar to a cruel and unusual punishment.this game is vexing , tedious , vain , working at McDonalds is more fulfilling and fun !And I would rather commit suicide than work at McDonalds!Do Not Suffer Your Self To Play This Game!Master of orion 2, MOO2, is ten by the power of millon times better!"
4,Space game cats in shambling zombie shock,"A lot of people have missed the point of this game. Yes, the gameplay [is not good], the interface is appalling, and it's a grotesque brain-dead shambling zombie of an ending (and surely this franchise is now ended) to one of the greatest videogame series of all time. But considering this game was written entirely by a team of *cats* it's amazingly good.On the other hand, you might want to think very carefully about ever buying an Infogramme/Atari game again. To have released a game this unbelievably bad at full price is both shameful and for this company typical."
1,MOO2 is better,"MOO3 offers little that is better than MOO2. The only major improvement is in the quality of the graphics. The planets are gorgeous. Everything else is horrible. Menu navigation, ship battles, exploration, espionage, ship design and colony management were all much better in MOO2. This game has become more tedious, not less as promised by the game designers. The manual tells an interesting story but is otherwise worthless. This game should have used MOO2 as a starting point. Don't be fooled - this game is nothing like the excellent games that came before it."
2,Not that good of a game,"I would not recommend this game to anyone. The battle sequence is nothing like MOO2. Just beacuse you change the style of space battle does not make it better. Ship customization is difficult. Don't even talk about troop deployment. The planetary AI is not developed enough, don't supply an AI option that you can't customize or at least point it toward the right direction. This might be a good game for a novice. I love these types of games and I was bored while playing this one!"
1,So where are all the old reviews?,"To sum them up, this game[...]....The graphics are outdated, it has lots of bugs and even worse a great deal of inconvenient features (that could have been so much better or already have been better in previous MoO incarnations). Gameplay is very clumsy and its also visually unattractive. Your influence as player is decidedly limited compared to MoO2. You can usually achieve good enough results by just letting the AI handle everything and just clicking the turn button.Especially if you liked MoO2 a lot you will be sorely disappointed by MoO3 since they didn not improve but reinvent the wheel, and it ended up with a flat tyre, and I want to warn everybody not to waste their money on this like I did. And if you don't know MoO2, get that one instead, its cheaper and most people like it better..."
5,One of the best game out there,"I just started to play Lords of the realm 3 and have been playing many more games lately (every month a new one). At the same time i've been playing MOO3 continuously for the last 6 months. With the patch 1.25, it's been my favorite game. There are fantastic games out there (Rise of Nations, GALCIV or CIV3 just to mention a few). However, none of these is as deep or have given me so much room for imagination. I am still learning the game, which is great. I guess if chess came out today, it would get the same bad reviews."
1,Pure Garbage,"One of the worst games I've ever played, and I've played a lot of them. Master of Orion 2 is a better game and that was made years ago, by a different developer.I played it for about a week when it first came out, and the bottom line is that it is just not FUN!!!I even gave it another chance when the patch was released, and it still just wasn't fun.Entertainment is the point of playing a game like this. The problem is that the guys who developed Master of Orion 3, created a game that is too much work for too little entertainment value!The graphics have all the charm of an excel spreadsheet, and the interface (while not impossible to get used to) is needlessly complex.Save your money...just do your taxes, it's pretty much the same thing!If there is to be a Master of Orion 4, it's development needs to be taken away from Quicksilver...they don't know what fun is."
1,All Work and No Play,"My advice, don't touch this game, even if you get the game for free. That is, unless you enjoy spending hours and hours and hours... being frustrated as you toil away. After ""playing"" mooIII for a couple of weeks, I felt I should have been given a paycheck."
1,Try Galactic Civilizations instead,"I should have taken it as a sign when the rebate earlier in the summer (2003) meant that Amazon was giving this game away for free.This game is too complicated and not enough fun. I loved MOO II and hoped to find this as an improvement. It's a huge step backwards in playability and the game does not seem to be particularly stable.There are a lot of interesting concepts in the game that are poorly implemented. The interface is not easy to decipher and I finally gave up.Fortunately, I found Galactic Civilizations instead. The AI, game play, and support and all excellent. I'd recommend spending your money on that instead."
2,Masters of Orion 3,"Someone managed to take a fun simple game and create a monster.There are some screnes that pop up from one screne, but when you close them you are not back where you started from. This makes several things in the game rather tedious.Also you can no longer create your own race without starting with one of the game races. There is no way to set up a unique race that lives in any atmosphere, because someone thought you shouldn't be able to.The game has some good ideas, but poor execution makes it rather less fun to play than the previous versions."
2,MOO3 Disappoints,"The keyword for this game is tedious. The gameplay engine is tedious and overworked. Nothing was made for ease of use or play. The game is good on the basics, but doesn't live up to the past Master of Orion wonder. After all the hype and sensationalism prior to release of MOO 3, I expected much more than what was delivered. MOO2:Battle at Antares is one of the best strategy games made, but MOO3 is just a distant step-cousin that is best left alone."
1,A Waste of $20,"Unfortunately, this game is a waste of the $20. I am sorely disappointed. As a fan of civilization II and MOO2, I expected much better.The initial graphics were slick, but the backstory makes little sense to me. The interface is difficult to navigate (e.g. you press escape to go back a level, but press it too many times and the game asks if you want to quit). It also tends to overlay windows and superfluous graphics over your selection.I found myself simply pressing the turn button over and over again with no real purpose. Controlling planetary production was pointless. But letting the AI do it meant it chose the wrong thing to build 25% of the time (I had 4 troop ships and no battle fleet to conquer a star first!).This is one of the few times that I'd like to get my $20 back. This game isn't worth the price of the media it's produced on."
1,This game lacks the MOO feel.,"This game is just a huge disapointment to me. So many changes from the first two MOO games it just doesnt feel like a MOO game at all. A new game should expand on the past ones and make improvements, i feel MOO3 was a huge step back not forward.Its also hard to take the developers in a serious manner when they tell you time after time that something is not possible and can never work with the engine....yet the patch comes out and look how many things in there were ""impossible"" before hand, names colors gui etc etc etc..Overall MOO3 and the development of it have been a huge dissapointment. Some love it but i'm not one of them."
1,This couldn't get any worse,"Wish I could give it 0 stars. Too bad. I shelled out $50 like a chump. Now they're giving it away almost. Still not worth the $15 Amazon is charging. Maybe $.01. Actually they'd have to pay me knowing what I know now. No redeeming qualities. Everyone who gave it a positive review is an Infrogrames/Atari hack, all games released by that company are junk. The amount they sold of this title came from brand recognition alone, and all those people were betrayed. Moo2 is still the best game of its kind, I wish another group of developers could try to re-create something similar. I miss it so."
5,GHS Flea Signature Bass Strings.,One of the best bass strings I ever used apart from my favorite choice DR Sunbeam. Smooth on the fingers and it give clear notes & sound when playing it.GHS M3045F Flea Signature Bass Boomers Medium Electric Bass Strings
1,scratched beyond belief,So scratched up.it wouldn't play very disappointed but didn't want to pay to ship it back.it def was not what i paid for as far as condition. My children were so upset the day it came
4,Great tunes diminished by mediocre production,"After Albert Hill broke up Aaron created the more rock orientated Dezeray's Hammer. Aaron, Kenny, and Chris released an amazing self-titled album followed by a live acoustic concert. Mortified was the band's second studo release, filled with catchy tunes but plagued with mediocre production. The production gives the music a nice raw feel, however those who prefer better quality should buy the album Immune. Don't be fooled by outlandish prices for this album, copies are still available at reasonable prices by contacting the band."
3,Mediocre at best,"Simply put, John McCarthy is an above averge player and a below average teacher. The fact that this ""beginner course"" is almost 3 years old, and there is no intermediate or advanced DVD tells you something.I knew something was off the moment I pressed play on the DVD player. The menu screen pops up, and we hear the sounds of a wailing ELECTRIC guitar, soloing for over 6 minutes. The DVD itself clocks in at only 40 minutes, and 6 of those minutes are dedicated to how to change a string. While playing, McCarthy often makes mistakes. He doesn't even bother to explain how you must always be seated while playing the classical, and how it should always be played upright on the left knee. He plays on his right knee for the length of the lessons, as if the guitar was an acoustic.Bottom line, McCarthy is a rock dude attempting to teach classical and fails."
4,Signature Music Trombone,"This is a fine, inexpensive instument for a beginer student. The slide action is smooth, and the mouthpiece is perfect for a student player. The walls are thin on this instrument making it quite lightweght and easy to carry in the provided case (which has backpack style shoulder straps). Overall, a good instrument for the price."
4,Great value for the price,My husband and I were looking for a reasonably priced trombone. We found it in this model. We did not have to go into hock to afford this one. It has worked out very well for my stepdaughter.
4,Happy with Trombone,My son is very pleased with the trombone. The tracker said that it would be delivered between July 2-7 and we received it on July 2.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this trombone for my 10 year old. He was using school trombone so he did not begin using it until the following year. After the music teacher examined it, he discovered it was bent so will not move as easily as it should. Unfortunately, it was pass warranty now I have to buy a new instrument. Very upset have to buy a new instrument after having it for less than a year and used it only a few times. Repair cost more than price. The value was not there."
4,Film Music of Hans Zimmer,I love this man's music for relaxing. I can relive the movies when listening to this CD. Good listening while reading.
5,fabulous!,"CD arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. I would recommend this seller to all my friends. Regards, Tracy"
5,Must-have Zimmer!,"By 2003, Hans Zimmer was working on his 100th--yes, one hundredth--feature film score. This is a rich two-disc collection that will remind you of some well loved movies: Driving Miss Daisy, Rainman and Da Vinci Code. The high point is the three tracks from Gladiator (one of those times when ""music better than movie"") and a rollicking couple of tracks from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (in the words of John Lennon: ""Play loud"").If you try to analyze Zimmer's melodies, they are simple, often four of five notes on a simple descending scale. But just when you think he's giving you soft rock pop, along comes a heartbreaking melody that you'll sing all day. The arrangements here are interesting, and never an endless verse-chorus-verse repeat.The album has a variety of fully orchestral tracks and some where the sythesizer is prominent. Its a great program and with two discs an excellent value."
5,GREAT MUSIC FROM HANS ZIMMER,"GREAT MUSIC FROM THIS CD,HANS ZIMMER IS ALWAYS GREAT BUT THIS CD BEATS THEM ALL"
2,Just get the albums,"I am a big fan of Zimmer in general, he has done some of my favourite scores. however i don't think this double CD is really worth buying unless you are new to Zimmer and want a brief overview of some of his work. There's seems a couple of odd choices on here when there is so much classic stuff to choose from, and i would thoroughly recommend getting the scores seperately to any film you may have seen which caught your ear.I don't think the arrangments here particularly add anything to the experience either, and if like me yuo enjoy the scores partyl as a memory of the film, i think you're better off with the original tracks and arrangments.Shame, could have been better."
3,Caveat Emptor,"You often buy an album from listening to one selection, the other are so so pieces and fillers of space, it is hard to believe a philharmonic orchestra actually performed some of these selections."
3,"Good, but pointless","Along with John Williams, Hans Zimmer is my favorite composer. My favorite scores of his are Inception and Nolan's Batman trilogy. This is his music, except it's from the City of Prague Philharmonic. The music is nice, but you should just listen to the originals. These versions don't add anything, and the tracks choices are random. You might like some, you might not. This isn't bad, but you should just get Zimmer's original tracks."
5,Bought for my son in law,This was a gift. I asked him what he thought of it and he loves it. He plays in a band and loves his music so if he says it is good it has to be good!
3,bad plastic case,"plastic case often brokes after using it once or twice. in some cases it is already broken when i receive it. the other characateristics, like audio quality, seem to be ok."
2,The book listed boring fact after fact.,"This book did nothing but tell uninteresting facts over and over. It wasn't really about the interesting things that were going on in theatre, but rather small ones. For example, it stated over and over what minimum wage was! Who cares? Do not get this book unless you enjoy being bored!"
2,Boring,"I had high hopes for this DVD. I really wanted to like it...but I did not. I thought it was boring. I love Christian contemporary music that is current and on the radio, but I did not like this music. Also, the instructor did not have much umph. I am used to a high energy class at my local gym and this is very much more layed back and boring. The instructor seems very nice, but she just didn't seem too motivational. I was going to leave well enough alone and not review this DVD, but I actually purchased it due to the rave review from the other person and I wasted my money. Used it once and will never use it again. Thought I would give my experience so that other people considering buying will weigh it out before purchasing. Just wasn't my style of workout or music."
1,Your child will not care about this book,This is the kind of book that grandparents get for their grandchildren. It is also a book that children universally ignore.
3,I Love Lucy -6th season,The shrink wrap was so tight on the boxed set thatit bent the box corners so it looked damaged. It wasfor a gift so that disappointed me. The gift receiverwas very gracious about it and said it didn't matter.This was a birthday gift ordered from Amazon.com.
5,dvd set,This was a replacement set for one I already had. It arrived in timely manner and in great condition. Thank you.
5,the best i love lucy dvd,I love lucy is one of my favorite tv shows but the sixth season was the best because it had the housewarming and the new furniture episdes and also the best one is lucy does the tango with those eggs in her shirt just make it the funniest tv show everLucy is the bestLinda Counts
5,Hilarious!!!,"Really enjoying these episodes of ""I Love Lucy."" PERFECT entertainment after a stressful day. Definitely plan on collecting every season of this wonderful series."
4,ok but nothing we haven't seen before,"It is nice to have all I Love Lucy Seasons on DVD but by Season 6 we are still getting the same jokes we got from Season 1. They decide to move in to the country when they only have 8 more shows to make ever, and Fred and Ethel still have to come with them. Could they ever have brought on any new regulars?"
5,Stilll hilarious,"Although we had seen many of these episodes growing up and since, re-watching them they still seem fresh. Lucy was just an amazing actress. It is interesting to see what a prominent role cigarette smoking played in those days."
3,Not the most helpful for Lutherans,"As a Lutheran pastor, I bought this hoping that it would be something we could give to parents and children in the congregation to help guide them through worship. Because it is very specifically geared to a Presbyterian service, it's not that helpful for explaining our Lutheran liturgy."
2,Nutrional Herbology,"I had heard great things about this book. I suspect the better version was an earlier edition. Now Pederson has expanded this book to herbalism, rather than the nutritional content. He is trying to sound like an herbalist, but being a professional herbalist myself, I think he does a poor job of mimicing one. He merely compiles. Fine for nutritional content but the book is much longer than it should be..."
3,INTERESTING,"I PURCHASED THIS CD AFTER HEARING A TRACK BY THIS BAND ON A MATADOR COMPILATION. MY INITIAL REACTION TO THIS RELEASE- I WISH THE GUYS WOULDN'T SING. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. WHEN THEY SING, THE SONGS ARE NOT AS COMPLEX AND SEEM VERY TYPICALLY INDIE. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE SONGS WITH SUE GARNER SINGING ARE QUITE COOL, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT PLEASED WITH THE WAY HER VOCALS ARE BURIED IN THE MIX. THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME ARE THE NUMEROUS TRACKS WITH INTERESTING STRUCTURES (WITHOUT BEING ARTY),UNEXPECTED TURNS (LIKE A DELICIOUS BIT OF VELVET UNDERGROUND-ESQUE GUITAR SOLOING... VERY ""I HEARD HER CALL MY NAME""), AND A DREAMLIKE ATMOSPHERE. HOWEVER, IT'S NOT A STRONG RELEASE, AND I FIND MYSELF RESTLESS, WANTING TO SKIP CERTAIN TRACKS. SORT OF AN ALMOST-YO LA TENGO, WHICH IS A NOT-BAD THING TO BE!"
5,If you like Vodka Sauce....,"Then you will love this. I actually like this better than some of the jar sauces out there. If you enjoy intense flavor then you can just add a second package. It's very creamy and once you start eating it it's hard to stop. My husband is not big on pasta, but when I made it with this sauce he couldn't get enough."
3,easy sauce,this sauce is very easy to make. just add milk or cream turns out nice mild sauce in ten minutes. i'll buy it again.
5,Very Informative; Unbiased,"This is one of the best Holocaust texts that I have read. Bergen does not waste space making her own assumptions; she presents an unbiased view toward the events, tells them in chronological order, and includes the perfect amount of accounts from people involved in the Holocaust as victims, witnesses, and SS personnel."
1,Instead of trashing,"Instead of just trashing someone else's work (that has helped many, many people) does this author actually have anything of use to say? Why write a book tearing down other people's work instead of adding your own original work? Any therapy can be abused to a silly extreme... that doesn't negate the proper use of the therapy itself. And what's with the automatic belittling of ""affluent white women""? Is one's affluence (...)and race a buffer to all psychological problems and pain? I think jealousy has reared it's ugly head with this author- not only in envying the success of someone else's work but in the personal vendetta against ""affluent white women"". I bet you anything this author's mother was an ""affluent white woman""!"
4,music with atmosphere.,"cd is full of atmosphere. this music can be used for (road)movies as well. Except maybe the track ""Blue train"" which is very dancable."
2,Mmmmmm...Jan goes a bit Soft!,"I have always love Jan's music. A powerful guitarist with terrific versatility who floats between jazz, rock, blues and classical styles and always keeps a thread. Here he loses it a touch. The album has no real direction and lacks a little backbone with a fairly weak reliance on drum-programming and somewhat lame production. OK! if you're reading this and getting hot under the collar with me, go back and listen to his earlier recordings. 'Jan Akkerman' (him in bed with his guitar-cover) was REALLY good and he surrounded himself with unbelievable musicians and production while embarking in a new direction (albeit many songs were old Focus numbers reborn). I always liked when Jan got a little aggressive in his playing which he doesn't do here. BUT he gets a pass as he's paid his dues and he likes to do whatever comes to mind. Yes.. Jan's a litle softer here and i would recommend earlier releases over this."
5,Superb fountain pen,"In my engineering days all the draftsmen had Pelikan equipment.Decades after unsatisfactory experiences with two Mont Blancs [scratchy nib on one, a broken piston on the other], I decided that I really wanted a fountain pen again. I remembered Pelikan, and bought one.The gold nib is silky smooth on the paper, with the ink flowing easily and without noticeable pressure. It flows readily even when I'm doing a crossword in bed and the nib is elevated.In addition to superior quality, the Pelikan has another advantage over Mont Blanc -- the nib screws in and is easily replaced [Pelikan has a large variety of nibs, including also italic].I now have four Souveran 400s [which fit my rather smallish hand] and four different ink colors. People with large hands might prefer the 600.A flawless writing instrument."
3,"For best results, modify the directions","I have had these ""twisters"" for about 8 months. They curl the hair well. However, I had to modify the directions. Remington explains that one end of the curler goes through the hole in the opposite end so no clips are needed. Unfortunately, I did not have success with the twisters staying in my hair doing this. After rolling my hair on the rod, I use a hair comb/clip to keep it in place. This product has more rods than the some other models by other manufacturers. I think that makes it a more attractive buy."
1,Don't Bother!,"I thought that this would be really cool to do your hair, but it wasn't. The curlers would not stay hooked together, and would get stuck in my hair. When I finally took them out, the curls looked horrible, or it didn't curl at all. Don't waste your money on this!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This product does not do as it promises. The curlers are difficult to apply to your hair and when you finally get them on there and pull the one side through the other, they uncurl themselves and fall off! The one twister that actually stayed in place didn't even curl, but rather crinked the hair near the root while it left the rest of my hair straight. Please don't waste your money on this product. It's not worth the trouble. I didn't even want to give it one star."
4,Great music,"I have heard this group in person and own this cd. Always enjoy listening to this cd. Have moved the cd to my ipod so I can listen to it at any time. If you enjoy Group Anhelo, you should enjoy this cd."
2,Hybrid,"The problem with Marco Polo is that it couldn't make up its mind whether it was a comedy or swashbuckler. Although I like him, Gary Cooper is miscast in this role (Ronald Colman or Robert Donat would have been better) and the screenplay needed to be more sober. George Barbier's Kubla Khan (sp?) is better suited to a Paramount farce with W.C. Fields. Ernest Truex, with that whiny voice, is almost unbearable. Who comes out on top as usual?....Basil Rathbone. He is the only reason I would watch this film."
3,"Not the Gary Cooper version, but still fun.","It is obvious from the photo that this particular movie does not feature Gary Cooper as Marco Polo. It is a more recently produced movie about Marco Polo, and the most famous actor is Jack Palance who plays Beezlebub, a self-proclaimed nastiest ruler of Armenia. This movie also does not take place on the water, rather Mr. Polo and company travel overland, seeking the way to China. Great costuming and excellent lighting for the beautiful terrain. If you're looking for an afternoon's or evening's entertainment, this is the one. No guarantees of historical correctness."
2,Marco?,"I'll always watch Gary Cooper. But as Marco Polo he's just not that good. MGM lavish production seems kind of chinzy. Amusing? Entertaining? Not so much. He hops effortlessly from Venice to China. He messes around with another man's fiancee in the 13th century as 20th century American men were wont to do. Nobody knows what Marco Polo was really like. He brought the west spaghetti & gunpowder. The rest of the story seems like it's from the screenwriters at MGM. The movie ends with Marco taking Princess Kukachin (Sigid Gurie) to her husband in Persia, the long way around. The more time to fool around until she marries. Nice."
4,A comprehensive survey of Cuban-American culture,"The Doctors Olson have assembled a thorough but precise history of the Cuban-American culture in America. This well-written history covers the story of the Cuban-American society from the earliest Cuban civilizations to modern times using American, Cuban, and Spanish primary sources. The narrative is detailed without being dry, and the themes are relevant to today's most salient issues. A ""must read"" for anyone studying Cuban-American ethnicity."
5,Awesome boots,"The hubby loves Dr. Martens, so I surprised him with these and he LOVES them. They are so solid and tough, but he says they're the most comfortable boots ever. He has had some of his Dr. Martens for 10+ years. This brand lasts. Well worth the money!"
2,Not for the well developed arch.,"I thought with all the glowing reviews of Dr. Marten's shoes and boots I couldn't go wrong, but that turned out to be wrong. The leather and other materials is good quality, but these boots seem to be aimed at people with short wide flat feet. There is no arch support. I got the ""D"" width and it fit wider than an ""E"". The toe box is nice and roomy, but the length is almost one size too short.The fit is more like standing on a platform with leather draped over your foot than actually wearing a shoe.Two stars for the leather and the fact that Amazon let me return them for a refund."
3,Not Bad If You Need to Study For PRAXIS II,"If you need a reference book on curriculum-related topics for the PRAXIS II Subject Exams, use this book as a starter (but get more if you can).By just studying this book, you can find most (not all) of the concepts (from specific curriculums to theoretical schools of though) that you need by either thumbing through the table of contents or scanning the index pages."
3,scarlet,ACTING VERY GOOD DID NOT CARE FOR STORY. LOVE TIMOTHY DALTON NO MATTER WHAT PART HE PLAYS.I JUST FOUHD THE STORY DEPRESSING
2,COULD OF BEEN A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING,"With an exceptional cast Like Dustin Hoffman, Vannesa Redgrave, Timothy Dalton you would think see a fine film, not so in this case. Hoffman plays a swarmy news reporter(with a slick hairdo that makes him look like Alpaha from the Rascals) who investgates the mystreoius 11 day dissaperence of famed author Agatha Christie. The producers had a good story but loused it up with boring melodrama and phony background music that will either make people laugh or fall asleep. Michael Apted was notin full swing here, but did a better job directing Sissy`s Spacek in COAL MINER`S DAUGHTER As for AGATHA this film lacks oringality and any decent performances"
1,Carp! Carp! Carp!,"That should have been the title of this book. It's one long complaint. Skip makes guiding for fish in the Florida Keys sound like working in the salt mines. Most of the guides I know don't expect their clients to be the experts they are. If they were then they wouldn't need their services. I also live in the Keys and I am familiar with the problems Skip encounters but I don't plan to move any time soon. I also found the writing to be less than smooth. A lot less. In ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" it is said that men solve problems while women just want to complain about them in order to receive sympathy. I'd say that hit the nail on the head."
5,Absolutely amazing and totally unnecessary,"This is a product of a top quality and near live-like design; however, it's likely to end up as couch pillow since it is complicated to implement a turtle into every day child's activities."
3,My son loves turtles,This is really cool and looks neat. Did arrive with a hole that went unnoticed until box was opened on Christmas morning. Had to do some repair since it was a gift but looks cool sitting on my son's bed
5,Great gift if you have someoen who likes animals,It was great my gf loved it so much it was really big though and the box it comes in is huge i would advise to try and get it delivered when your home but great packaging and shipping
5,"Wow, what a beautiful stuffed animal","I bought this for my fiancee after a trip to Hawaii in which we swam with sea turtles. It is really a beautiful product. It is large and well-made, with the body being roughly the size of a regular bed pillow, though round instead of rectangular. The fur is plush and soft, and feels really nice to stroke. The detail and colors used are really top-notch, with subtle and varying shades of green, brown, white and gray. Even the underside of the turtle is carefully patterned and colored to match nature.The animal is stuffed with a springy material, so it resists when you put pressure on it. You can definitely use it as a pillow, though it feels more like one of those firm foam pillows than soft down ones that you sink into. This may account for the first review who felt the toy was harder than expected.But you can definitely cuddle with this thing--way have! We love the product, it has brought us a lot of enjoyment."
3,good but needed repair,This animal is nice and large as described. There was a section of its shell that needed to be repaired as it looked as if the material was not sewn down completely.
5,A favorite,"We gave this to my then-17-month-old at Christmas. It quickly became one of his favorite possessions. He greets it every morning, dances with it (though it's as big as he is), feeds it, talks to it, and gives it many, many hugs."
2,Not that great,"If you have previous project management experience this would not be a good purchase. If you are new at project management, you may find it beneficial but there are better books out there."
2,Project Management Isn't For Me,"I don't know whether the book was poorly written or whether I just really don't like project management, but I found myself nodding off while reading it. I just couldn't get into it. And how was I supposed to learn something so complicated in just 24 hours? I used to think I wanted to be a project manager, but now I definitely do not."
5,A good read. A page turner,"I really enjoyed Red Moon. It is a classic, mystery-suspense novel, but is so well written that it belongs with the best of the genre. I especially enjoyed all I learned about New Mexico and that the characters were so well drawn. I found it so interesting that the detective was blind and that we ""saw"" things through his ""eyes"" and I enjoyed the protagonist, Howard Moon Deer who is flawed but kind and sexy. The prologue is one of the best I have read with a wonderful description of the rainbow man. I look forward to ""Ancient Enemy"" which, I believe, is due to be published this fall. If you have not discovered Robert Westbrook I urge you to do so. His books are thoroughly good reads."
1,Ancient Enemy,"I was greatly disappointed with this book. The main character is not a Ella Clah (Aimee and Davis Thurlo), Charlie Moon (James D. Doss), nor a Jim Chee or Joe Leaphorn (Tony Hillerman) but instead the book is about a blind ex-cop from California and his college-educated indian assistant from Minnasota working in New Mexico. It reads more like a typical 1940's detective novel. Your money would be better spend on a Thurlo, Doss, or Hillerman book. I had the same feelings when I read Westbrook's companion book ""Red Moon""."
5,MADE IN THE USA AND FITS PERFECTLY,"Fits my 06 LJ perfectly. Very well made, easy to open and close considering its nice thickness. I was a skeptical spending this much $$$ on a sunshade, but I was tired of the cheap ill fitting shades that start to fall apart and don't fit well. This one should last a long time."
3,Ho hum,"This cd consists mostly of mediocre covers of some former hits. No Matter What is a great tune, and there are others that are worth a listen, but by and large a collection by the original artists would be better. Only BoyZone fans (are there many?) would rave about this one. I'm glad I got it as a gift from a special lady, rather than spending my money on it."
4,By Request- Boyzone,After a recent holiday in England I fell in love with Ronan Keating's music. I figured I would try out his boy band roots. The songs overall aren't as catchy as N'Sync or Backstreet Boys but it is a very enjoyable album and I am glad that I purchased it.RIP Stephen Gately.
5,THIS IZ JUST THE MOST AWESOME CD U COULD HAVE .,THIS IS A REALLY GREAT CD WITH THE BEST OF BOYZONE. UNDOUBTEDLY THEY R THE BEST . C MON THEY HAV THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HITS THAN ANY OTHER BOY BAND . THOUGH I LOVE BACKSTREET BOYS AS WELL I THINK BOYZONE HAVE A MORE UNIQUE SENSE TO THEM .A MUST BUY 4 ALL BZ FANS.
4,"IT'S A GREAT CD, FULL OF SURPRIZES!","There is much variety of music on the disc, more than i expected. I bought it in Britain and have listened to it as much as i can since i got home. The songs are all good but i can't honestly give the disc five stars because i think that they could do a bit better. I think that all Boyzone fans should buy this CD. It is very good to listen to. Although i think that they could have more songs that they write themselves. But indeed this CD is a must for Boyzone fans."
3,A bridge between Dirt of Luck and Magic City,Although I wouldn't say this contains any of the best helium songs I've ever heard it plays nicely. It's a worthy edition to anyones helium collection and I definately rate it higher then Pirate Prude.
5,good for detailing car,This is a great little tool for detailing the tiny nooks and crannies that car washes miss.
2,Superficial : save your money,"I was expecting a book that gave more information about the origin of idiomatic phrases. This book was superficial and did not give significan information about any of the idioms/phrases. I am still looking for a book that is worth the money I pay. I would like a book that discusses the origin of idioms: an **annotated** book of idiomatic phrases. When I did an Amazon search for such, this book is one that came up. Sadly, not at all true. If you know of a good book, please write a note/addendum to this review. Thank you!"
3,Dissapointing,"I had high expectations of this book when I first saw it on Amazon. (I was recommended this book after reading ""The Mannequin Man"" by Luca Di Fulvio which I thought was amazing) The plot of the novel is good, and the end leads you to a surprising (somewhat perplexing) twist. My main problem with this novel though, is the way it is written. I love snarkey, sarcastic characters, but it seems as if Pelletier is incapable of writing a straight sentence. The dialogue between Maurice and his boss is ridiculously tounge-in-cheek. It seems like Pelletier is trying too hard and still doesn't accompish the mood she is after. It is very likely that something is lost in the translation, because this was just a bit over the top for me."
5,FLAWLESS. PERFECT. MASTERPIECE.,Yo this the first album I've seen with a perfect 5-star rating and deserves every bit of the praise.Little Brother is the real deal! Holla!
1,This album is about as horrible as a Minstrel Show,"Wow and I thought Common's album was overrated. This junk is probably the most overrated album of all time. This is nothing more but but stupid and idiotic bashing of the mainstream hip hop industry which there is nothing wrong with. This garbagge is boring, wack, lame, and just plain bad. The production on here is also horrible and the lyrics don't work. Go get Juelz Santana, Lil Wayne, or Chamillionaire's new albums instead. Or if that's not up your alley than get Kanye's CD. Just avoid this garbage at all costs. One of the worst albums of last year."
5,LB Better go platinum,"Little Brother is a group from Durham,NC, that i knew about back in the listening days. They finally got some publicity from XXL and they didnt let the hype get to em'. They Lyrically massacre the album and the beats,while sounding very very similar still are on point. My favorite song is slow it down, the comes hiding place, beautiful morning, and we got now. All in All this album is flawless. Its a much needed follow up to common's BE and Kanye's Late Registration.Lyrics-10/10Beats-10/10Features-10/10Replay-10/10Overall-just cop it and do yaself a favor MAIN...... and dont sleep on cheatin' thats a funny ass joint"
4,OK but I was hoping for more,"I am a total beginner and that is what this instructional DVD is obviously for. But after watching it I came away wishing there was more to it. If you are a total beginner you can definitely pick up some good information but there isn't a whole lot of material covered. In addition to this DVD, I would also consider two others by Ralph Shaw:The Complete Ukulele Course taught by Ralph Shaw&Essential Strums for the Ukulele."
3,HOW ABOUT A SONG LISTING? WHAT AM I LEARNING?,"Brother... What if I already have all the songs? What if I know all the songs already? What if I don't like the songs? What if I don't have the songs but want them?Why do these kind of products never list their songs? Buy a handful, and you've got 5 different ways to play the same songs. How can you grow if you only know 2 songs because they keep repeating over and over?Here is a description *I* didn't make (Credit at the end) with some songs listedDesigned for people with some musical knowledge, but little to no experience on the ukulele, this instructional documentary offers advice on tuning as well as a dictionary that shows how to play over thirty chords. The program also teaches how a viewer can, once these lessons are mastered, play a number of famous songs including ""Danny Boy,"" ""Streets of Laredo,"" and ""Clementine."" ~ Perry Seibert, RoviWould be nice if someone who bought this and made a review would include the song listings.."
3,Finding Haiku,"Jack Kerouac is truly an American icon. His writing has become legendary- and I think for good reason. His style of writing brought about a revolution in the way to construct a novel and his unique insight into his characters gave us, the reader, a new way of understanding both them, and ourselves. However, as far as a Haiku poet, his greatest gift was one of exploration. This book is less a book of great Haiku, and more of an experiment in Haiku. Most of his poems fall dreadfully short of what a real Haiku poem can do. I highly recommend ""Take a Deep Breath: The Haiku Way to Inner Peace"" by Sylvia Forges-Ryan to those who are really interested in understanding the deep and fragile art of Haiku. The poetry of Sylvia Forges-Ryan rings true both to the traditions of the form and often, to the depths of our souls."
3,Are Haikus and Haiku the same thing(s)?,"If the title of this book would have been ""Book of Iambic Pentameters,"" and not followed the literary format of iambic pentameter poetry, no one would take it seriously. Point: Many of the poems in this collection can be considered haiku, but it is misleading to those seeking true haiku to look to this book for good examples of this ancient genre. As a haiku poet, I don't like much of this book. As a non-genre poet, I think Jack's work is quite enjoyable. I'd pick it up more often if it were titled, ""Book of Poetries."" And, for those who judge books by their covers, I like the cover... more than the psuedo-haiku contents."
5,"Well researched, well written book from the messaging expert","Sue continues to amaze us with her knowledge and techincal depth. All I can say is ""keep 'em coming, Sue!"""
5,Do Not Listen While Driving,"This set of tapes is so fast, so powerful, so high in content, that it will take your breath away. Do not listen in your car; you will want to take notes.Drew Eric Whitman, the Direct Response Surgeon, sets the (fast-paced) tone in the first cassette and then he is followed by ten of the most successful people in advertising, marketing and sales.As an author and a publisher, who has run his own business for over 30 years, I highly recommend this valuable audio. DanPoynter@ParaPublishing.com."
5,Now you can learn jealously guarded business secrets,"Who is this Drew Eric Whitman? And how can he help me?Those were my thoughts as I read his captivating ad for The $50,000 Business Makeover Marathon. I was spell bound. And you will be too.Being an adventureous sort, as all entrepeneurs are, I decided to take the plunge and purchase it. You know what? It was everything he said it would be, and more!Drew, if you read this, thank you. We may never meet but you have changed my life and business.After listening and putting into action many of the tips(lessons, really) I have seen an amazing change in my professional and personal affairs.I own six other tape programs on sales and marketing and this one is unique. Get it now. While you're thinking about it.Better hurry. Your competition may already have this.Yours in Success,..."
1,Does not hold the GPS unit securely,"Unfortunately, the mount does not hold the Magellan gps unit securely. A solid bump in the pavement or a rock on the trail sends the GPS unit flying. I guess they forgot to test the mount on a bike before they offered it for sale."
3,Shocking.....At Least For The First Viewing,"Wow, this is another strange movie. Maybe ""bizarre"" are even ""weird"" would be better descriptions.I watched this movie twice, and found it to be one of those films that is very interesting the first time around, but not so cool on the second look when the thin story becomes more evident. Some movies are like that, mainly the ones which are wacky and the viewer is shocked at what he's seeing. When the shock wears off, it isn't so entertaining.Let's stick to the first look: the film kept my attention because I kept wondering what crazy thing was going to happen next. It's hard to explain this story because its a combination of genres and an attempt at black humor. Be warned, too, on the first viewing: the first 25 minutes are slow, and then it picks up, so stick with it."
4,Quirky Comedy From Scorsese,"After tackling heavy topics in his previous films, Scorsese made a departure from form and directed a comedy. But even for Scorsese, a comedy entails a word processor's date with a nice girl turning into an infinitely Kafka-esque nightmare where one bad episode follows another. I recall seeing ""After Hours"" at the time and considered it to be unlike any film I'd ever seen. It still holds up well. The only films akin to the work Scorsese has done here may be the work of the Coen brothers. Griffin Dunne is great as the harried lead and he is complemented with a great supporting cast. A minor criticism of the film is that the indignities heaped on Dunne may be a little overdone at times."
4,After Hours,This is one of the most unusual movies I've seen in years. It is really worth the time. This was a gift.
3,After Hours by Victor Argo,"This is an odd little film. I like it because it takes an innocent man, looking to spend some time with a girl he thought was cute and ends up through a string of weird coincidences, being chased by a torch-bearing mob through the streets of New York very late at night. It is hilarious in a very dark way and makes you realize how easy things can get out of your control. If you like quirky films, please give this one a try."
5,If you think you had a bad day...watch this.,Absolutely hilarious! This poor guy has the worst luck ever all in a 12 hour period.
1,Relationship breaker,Took a date to this when it was in the theatres. The movie was so bad we broke up afterwards.Its like a badly directed 3's company episode. Horrible.
4,Ah Scorcese before he sucked,"Before Scorsese made bloated mainstream Hollywood epics, he made quirky, inventive films that defied simple categorization like this one. Sure its a comedy, but it's not so much ""hilarious"" as it is fascinating. Like picking at a scab one one's body but without the repercussions. That doesn't make this movie sound like much fun but it is! It's very enjoyable to sit comfortably at home and be glad as hell our night isn't going like Griffin Dunne's is."
5,CRAZY AND AWESOME...!,It is one of my favorite movies ever. The story is so crazy and amazing. Scorse it is a great director. Very good story and well made. I LOVE IT...!
5,Fiction & Myth,"Blue Winnetka Skies is like nothing I've read before. It's a wild, funny, poignant and powerful book. It's got cyber thieves and teen anarchists; it has echoes of western films and 1960s television shows, and other elements of American popular culture. It feels pulled straight from today's news. This is a novel that shows us how weve arrived at where we are. I found it a thought-provoking examination of the myths that shape us and drive us."
5,What a trip!,"What a terrific book! If the current state of your world has ever made you think of picking up and leaving it all behind, then you'll enjoy travelling with these characters. Try as they might, they cannot escape facing the lack of security in the world around them or within themselves. Ultimately, the power of friendship and an ironic sense of humor gets them through.Poignant and playful, Blue Winnetka Skies reminds you to sit back and enjoy the ride, and the ones travelling with you."
5,Post-post modern western.,"This is a complicated story that is excellently crafted. The main characters are running away and so go west with the conflicting desires to disappear and to connect. There is the ""hunted"" feel of the great westerns which works well as it seems everyone is trying to escape circumstances and/or consequences. There are two unique literary devices that took some getting use to. One that involves movies on drive in theatre screens illuminating the plot and the second; well you'll have to read the book to see if it works for you. In this age where we struggle to find meaning in the scrap piles of our own making, this novel captures a yearning, a working it out while viewing in full the paths ahead. The sheriff is coming for ya, it's just that he's not over the next hill, he's watching from the unconscious. Let's hope that Ron MacLean has another book coming soon!"
3,Its ok.,I saw almost all of these episodes on TV. You dont even see the shots being fired you hear them. They count tazing someone as shots fired. It is not graphic at all. The only good part to this DVD is the bonus section. Its about 10 to 15 minutes long and its how the entire DVD should have been done. I am training to be a police officer so I like this DVD just because of some training value it can give. If you watch COPS a lot you won't really like this DVD.
4,shots fired,"It was pretty interesting. Have to give it a 4star, because there could've been a little more bloody & gory shots, but other then that, i'd say it was worth what i paid for this dvd."
2,All about the taser!,"Nothing like the cheap thrill of watching someone get tasered, repeatedly. Other than a few other scenes where people get shot out of camera view, you should pick up something else.Conan O'Brien's - The Best of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, DVD is a good example of better low cost entertainment."
4,YESSSS!!!!!!,"At last! I've searched for this flick for the past 28 years and finally found a copy at the Orlando MegaCon. The main reason I hadn't had any luck is due to the fact I was thinking for the longest time that I was looking for an Ultraman movie from 1975. There was no such thing. As soon as I saw Inframan on the cover, I remembered...that was it! Anyway, if you're into Godzilla or kaiju in general you must check this out. (I also thought it was japanese...my mistake again!) Lots of crazy kung fu action and monsters. Great fun!"
4,Contains good insights on love,"The first, second, and last chapters of this book are great. The middle part is interesting, but one can take or leave it. Fr. Powell starts by speaking of love, and the problem of lack of love. He speaks of pain leading to selfishness.The middle of his book is a lot of psychological development issues that I'm not sure belong in that book where they are. In the last chapter, Fr. Powell finally makes his point. We must forget ourselves and reach out to others. It is a lesson that I have never forgotten, but oh how hard to live it is."
5,Great for deepening relationships,My boyfriend and I both have this book and it has helped us to grow as a couple. We have grown closer and opened the door to deeper understanding. We understand each other more than ever and appreciated one another.
3,Great Music - Defective CD,"I'd give the CD a 4+, but unfortunately, the disc I received has a defect that spans two tracks. It's an annoying clicking or ticking sound that goes on for several minutes. Not worth the effort and energy to return to Amazon."
4,Flows like a Dream.,"This is great history. I could not put it down but I gave it four stars because I did not feel it was in the same class as Simon Sebag Montefiore's ""Stalin: In the Court of the Red Tsar."" Radzinsky in no way compiles the same type of comprehensive narrative as does Montefiore but it is very much worth your time. The archival evidence he uses is excellent and this is particularly true for someone who went to school (as I did) before the fall of communism. His best nugget involved Mikhail Bulgakov accidentally hanging up the phone on Stalin who assumed that he was the recipient of an April's Fool joke (p.262). Stalin, the sphinx, actually got Bulgakov a job at the Moscow Arts Theatre. The inconsistencies of the General Secretary's personality are clearly displayed by the author in this 1996 effort."
1,Garbage,"...Stalin, certainly no great guy and a butcher, was not responsible for every evil committed in the USSR. The horrors of his regime and the USSR were more than just one guy, one guy that is easily blamed for everything today. Unfortunately our modern society wants to find pat answers to complex questions, and this book provides those in a cheap fashion. History is not written by inuendo and rumor, and that is what drives this book. The only reason I give a 2 instead of 1 (or zero) is because the book does have several excellent photos inside."
2,"A plebeian, sensationalist treatment of a serious subject","Josef Stalin was a complicated character, and Edvard Radzhinsky wrote an uncomplicated book about him. Radzhinsky sensationalizes all of the old stories, repackages them with the imprint of the Soviet archives, and opens up his huckster table. This book is fine for the ideologue, since all he'll use it for is to line his bookshelf. For serious scholars, read the text closely if studying Stalinist hagiography. Otherwise workaday."
3,Hard read but interesting,"Very detailed and thorough. Lots of interesting information on this monster.If you can slog through it, it's rewarding, but a lot of info to keep in your head while reading"
4,"Pretty good,with a couple of minor flaws","This volume contains much new data and for that alone it is worth reading.The author captures the horror and senseless nature of Stalin's purges in a dramatic fashion.But the book takes too long to get going and seems to ramble on a bit.These are,however,minor flaws that can will be overcome if you are genuinely interested in the riveting subject matter.All in all it is worth your time"
4,Too Personal?,"I've never found biographies filled with personal animosity to be all that interesting to read. However, it may be a bit much to ask anyone who grew up in the Soviet Union to put aside his or her feelings for one of the world's greatest mass murderers.Unfortunately, Radzinsky didn't stop after revealing his opinions on Comrade Stalin. I got the distinct impression that he didn't care much for either Sudaplatov or Orlov, figures with a history in Soviet intelligence who are both widely published. I'd read Sudaplatov's book about his years in the NKVD a couple of years ago and found it a great read, especially in the area of emigre organization infiltration. Radzinsky seems to feel that Sudaplatov was a liar and he didn't hesitate to let the readers know.Regardless, this a comprehensive bio which did capture my interest and hold it throughout."
5,"great product,great value","think it's all said in the title, same great taste as always, just don't have to worry with the store or forgetting or running out"
2,Not what expected.,"OK, yes the price is good. But the taste quality is bad. Sugar has to be added to the mix. The envelopes are of smaller quantity than usual. So you have to use 2 packets to make the usual serving.I will not buy again."
5,rich goodness,"i really dig Swiss Miss. it has a creamy deliciousness about it that can not be beat.as someone has mentioned earlier, it is wonderful in coffee.actually, that is the only way i've enjoyed Swiss Miss. i'm sure there are many other applicationsthat this frothy mix can be used for."
1,not as expected,"The book had not been as I expected,because it had copied badly and the paper was very bad.I think it was the worset book I ever read."
5,Good Quality,The DVD was received in just a few days after ordered. It came in good shape and it worked well.
5,"Emotionally draining, excellent read","I read this book in two days of intense bedtime reading. It drew me in and kept me thinking all day about the characters, their strengths, and their problems. All of the main ""family"" characters are well developed, multi-faceted, and interesting people. The book had the power to make me feel real pain for the characters, and had the dexterity to surprise me as a reader from time to time."
2,one thing ruined everything else,"The fate of the sole atheist in the book, who just happened to be the only one devoted to the scientific method and who just HAPPENED to be the sole woman in the Earth crew, was horribly unjust, and the tiny amount of space devoted to it made it even more insulting. IMHO that element wrecked whatever else the book might have achieved. Sorry."
5,I recommend this book to anyone who is searching...,"Although the author's experience is in the Judaic tradition, she speaks with personal authority about universal spirituality. I would suggest that anyone who is searching, no matter what their tradition, can find meaning in this book. The author exhibits an amazing awareness about her own journey while at the same time capturing and explaining much about the universal journey of Self."
5,This movie is a gem,"Rarely do we see such fine actors as Helen Mirren and James Mason in a character study so simply mythic. To my eyes, Ms Mirren is a rare beauty, and in this movie the filmmakers had the good sense to show her in all her youthful glory. Here too, James Mason is at ease, in a role where he is often the only person on screen. His natural grace and sense of play is evident. Maybe it's that sense of play that I appreciate so much about Age of Consent. It's a crime that this film is not available on DVD."
5,Meat and Potatoes on Selling,I am a health professional and I have read many books on selling. This book is without a doubt the best one that I have read. It is clear and concise and it gives you a step by step process to accomplish world class selling in an ethical way. I will definitely read it over again because it is now an important resource in my library. I have read lots of fluff! This book is definitely meat and potatoes on Selling!
2,Crackling,"The CD player has some problems. First, the sound quality is pretty bad in the headphones and on commerically avaliable ones from Panasonic and Sony. The bass is not good, and treble is somewhat screechy. Secondly, and most importantly, I hear cracks. Not skipping, like the music will stop, just cracks, and a lot! I went to check if it was the CD and it wasn't, it was this Coby CD player.If you're going to buy a good CD player, why not fork out $20 more for a Panasonic, Sony, Philips, or another good quality brand. If you're gonna get something, why not get something a little more expensive and not have to buy several (which will cost more in the long run) CD players. Why not get a CD player that is better than the rest? DFJ-200, SL-CT582V, the RP models, those are some good examples."
1,Bah.,"After using it for quite some time, I decided that I wouldn't buy this CD player for $5! For your average music listener who can't tell the difference between good or bad sound, this is perfectly fine. For those who can, the sound is decent. Passable, but not great. I also found it a little flat. (Not as in intonation.)The button to open the CD player is pretty aggravating. You really have to push it down. Because of the odd angle at which the button is placed, you'll have to put another finger on the CD player or else it'll skid across the table.Because this has no skip protection, it's really inconvenient. You have to glide across the floor to prevent it from skipping. Even a little nudge can cause it to skip.I'd suggest doing some research and spending your money on something better."
1,Don't buy this item,I purchased 4 of these CD players for my kids for Christmas. Only 2 actually worked. As far as returning them the freight would have been more than the items. I dont think that I will ever look at anything COBY again.
2,I should have read the reviews!,"Read the other reviews. I agree with all the negative comments, especially about it not having nonskip ability. I should have read the reviews first before purchasing the product."
5,Vanilla is an AWESOME song!,"This CD is great! Vanilla is one of my FAVORITE Gackt songs! Vanilla is upbeat and pop-ish. The instrumental version is great for kareoke...but my favorite track is Vanilla Night Version. It's unplugged and it's wonderful! Gackt sounds like a lounge singer almost, but it's just so great! This is an awesome buy! I highly recommend it!"
5,Everything that I expected,This manual has a lot if info in it and many pictures that are helpful when looking for specific parts. I would recommend this for a useful tool to assist in repairs and restoration.
3,"48"" Wall Trough Replacement Liner","I found the quality of the 48' wall trough replacement liner to be very good, the height of the sides do not reach the top of my metal trough. It is about 3"" short all the way around. I did not see any indication that a deeper liner was available."
4,Easy to fly,Flies well in moderate wind. Easy to assemble and launch. Seems durable. I suggest using a fishing type swivel to connect line to kite to avoid line twist.
3,not the world's best quality,"for some reason, the DVD began to skip after only watching it twice. i was really disappointed. i know it's not an issue with the DVD play because none of the other DVD's i own had that problem."
1,"Bigotry, insensitivity and sheer stupidity, not comedy","This is a show of outright bigotry and extreme stupidity. He laughs at people's culture thinking he is exposing anti-Semitism. He is in fact attracting more of it. Governments have threatened to sue him and he has received death threats. This, to him, is a sign that his ""comedy"" is cool. You can always generate a reaction by throwing insults, which really is not cool. It is not only bad taste, this guy has a project of ridicule, the same Hitler used before sending his ancestors to the Gas Chambers."
1,The (im)practical approach to DW design,"If you work for a large corporation which has millions of $ to spend on DW projects, maybe you should look at this book and even consider some of the ideas that it contains.But if you need to develop a data warehouse using limited resources and within a certain timeframe, your time will better used reading other books, because following the Inmon approach will lead you to an unnecessary complicated and expensive design.I found that the arguments used by Inmon to demonstrate the limits of the dimensional approach are not convincing at all. For example, at page 142 he says ""Because there is a different data structure for each data mart, making any data mart into a data warehouse doesn't make sense.""Having personally implemented several data warehouses using the ""conformed dimensions"" approach, I can guarantee that it worked and produced a very elegant and clean data model."
2,Unrewarding slog,"Ok, I just don't get it. ""Building the data warehouse"" feels like a padded and generally under-edited collection of essays on topics of varying interest. Its focus is ""orthogonal"" to that of Kimball's ""Data warehouse toolkit""; Chapter 13 is the easy-to-see overlap, but gave me no clue about the nature of the supposed ""Team Edward vs. Team Jacob""-scale conflict between the two camps. However, as far as writing is concerned, the comparison with Kimball's book is clearly not in favor of Inmon's thicker tome, highlighting its frustrating tendencies for vagueness and hand-waving."
4,Reply to above post,Its baking soda you are supposed to use I believe-never use flour-it will make a fire bigger! The fry daddy is great though!
4,get what you pay for in a good way,This product does all it should I use it ALL the time. the downsize is the size. other than that perfect would highly recomend it
3,What for the technology to improve and reduce in price,This monitor is ok. It produces and very good picture with bright and vivid colors. There is a good chance that you will get a bad pixel or two which can be a HUGE annoyance that you just can't seem to keep your eyes off. It has a solid base and seems well constructed. It is good for normal computing but if you are doing a lot of gaming or video i would steer clear of this display.Note that this monitor is only for sony computer!!! It contains a proporitary cable
1,"Would love to, but....","I would love to write a review for this product because that would mean I actually have it! Is there ANY rational or reasonable excuse as to why it is now going on close to 5 MONTHS since my order has been placed, and will likely be a HALF YEAR before I actually receive it?! Would anybody there wait six months for anything? I must be nuts."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book very much. It's satire of business life made me laugh, and the mind set of the characters toward today's way of life made me think about my own life. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that I did not think Ronnie was such a good idea, but then it did show that Fritz is human like the rest of us. This is a good read!"
2,The book was a bit tiresome to read but it still had an interesting message.,"Overall, the group I'm in liked the book and thought the author did a fine job of presenting his characters as well as the story line. The story resulted in a lively discussion of how this book reflects some current behaviors."
5,Surprisingly important book for new managers.,"I read this a few years after I had been in senior management and wished deeply that I had discovered it earlier. One of the great challenges facing new managers is decision making where the choices all involve some positive and negative aspects. There are also many organization pressures that force individuals to consider suboptimal paths to ""be a team player.""It's a slippery slope and one that is hard to navigate without a great deal of thought and a clarity of personal professional purpose.This is a small book that easily engages the reader in a fascinating path to understanding these core management issues.Management, especially senior management, starts to look like politics and turns into a soup of interests and circumstances that make the ""right"" decision hard to discern and possibly even harder to live with.Given the impact to size ratio and high quality of the writing I'd make this book a must-read in the category."
5,excellent thought,an excellent book to readfor the first time managers as well. Great insights and real life examples.
4,Pleased with purchace.,"Overall, this barrier works great and I've recommended it to friends. In my vehicle (Chrysler Sebring 4-DR sedan) it rides at a slight angle so it occasionally slips just a little at the ceiling, but I think I would find this with any similar barrier in this car. I would buy again!"
1,Impossible to Assemble.,"The instructions say to ""Insert verticle upright tubes through 2 of the plastic ...support brackets""."" While that sounds like sliding it right through, in fact it's so tight that using WD-40 and a hammer, it still wouldn't slide. Then the plastic bracket split in the middle, (It didn't break at the top or bottom; it split like the seat of your pants) because the upright is too fat for it!Order theMidwest Pet Barrier 11 with 6 Tubular Metal Barsonly if you can get it assembled already. Let them deal with getting the replacement parts needed when you discover it is ""Impossible to Assemble""!"
3,"It works, but it's not amazing...","Installation was easier then the instructions claimed. They were obscure, and just plain annoying. Use common sense here and you'll have it done in no time. That being said, however, the company failed to include two of the boots for it. I installed it temporarily without them (which was pretty unstable) and called them. The shipped them out within a few days.Overall it's a decent product, but not without some trouble. It's pretty tightened in the car it's being use in, and yet it still gives way every-so-often. I'd recommend researching a bit more before settling on this one."
3,Okay pet barrier.,I intended to use this to keep my dog in the cargo area of my SUV. She is too good of an escape artist for this item. She figured out several ways to get past it - first time I didn't make it around the block and she was up visiting me. I gave up.
1,NOT HAPPY WITH IT,It Has Plastic Clips That Hold The Bars On Before I Went To Use It One Already Broke. Dogs can Break It And Get Out So Easy. Why In The Heck didnt it Have Metal Clips. TO CHEAPLY MADE. I Have German Shepherds Not CHIHUAHUA's DO NOT LIKE..
3,Tom and Jerry,This game was not as fun as I thought it would be. I was expecting something more active. I guess I should have looked more into it before I bought it.
3,A little disapointing,"This was the first boot by Norah Hess I have read and I have to say I didnt get off to a very good start. I am an AVID reader, and usually when I get done with a book I have a sense of fulfillment. I know it sounds corney, but I walk away thinking WOW that was realy good. I like to be absorbed by the book. I wasnt with this one. It has really good characters, and a so-so plot. For me the two biggest problems were the villian didnt get what he deserved. He was pretty much completely ""cut out of the book"". The second problem for me was that the book ended to aburuptly. I like a book that winds down slowly, leaving you feeling happy that the hero and heroine finally got together and fell in love. It seemed to me that this couple had just started their ""adventures"" together, when I turned the page and the book was over. I will read more of her books however. Maybe I just picked the wrong one."
4,Good Book for Quick Reference,"This is a great book to read and review every once in a while, if you're not a professional in the medical field. If you're having a medical emergency, however, this isn't the type of book you'd want to consult - and the author would quite agree with that. You can easily read it in an hour, and that's an hour that is well worth your investment of time."
4,Weather Station Review,Great hardware but the documentation leaves a lot to be desired. As with many products the documentation appears to be written by engineers instead of professional writers. Overall the product works great and I am pleased with the weather system.Fred
3,It's a departure for Rod.,"We were one of the first to get this CD. If you are looking for the GOLD STANDARD ROD MCKUEN, this NOT it. However I thought the CD was a pleasent departure for Rod, but my ""other-half"" did not like it. She has been a longer fan of Rod than I have. I found the beat to be good, however Rod tends to wander abit... Something different tho."
4,best evidence david lifton,"Back in 1980, Mr. Lifton, in my opinion, set the bar at the highest level, as far as beginning to unravel the JFK assassination conspiracy. By making a startling discovery in a FBI report, following it up with eyewitness accounts from the autopsy personel, as well as the publication of some of the photos and x-rays, the realty of how deep the conspiracy is begins to take shape. If you are new to finding out information about the assassnation, the book is well planned and is easy to follow. If you are advanced in your knowledge, then this book will fill in alot of the gaps in the medical aspect of the assassination. I've worn out my first copy and came to this sight to get a new version."
5,An Amazing Book!,"One of the most thorough and impressive of all the JFK assasination books. This work is incredibly well researched and documents Lifton's 15 year search for the truth behind the assasination and who could have been responsible. If you read just one book about this subject this should be it!Ronald Cavaye, London, U"
5,This book defeats the Warren Report,When given this book I believed the Warren Report After many hours of study of Mr Lifton's work I began to doubt W.R. I gave this book to a Prominate Jurist and He also gained a new insite. My Thanks to Mr. Lifton for his work.
5,A truly scary book,"With 900 + pages of exhaustive research David S. Lifton PROVES, undeniably, that factions within our own government perpetrated and covered up the assassination of JFK.This is truly the scariest book I have ever read.If you read one book on the assassination, make it this one."
5,How open-minded are you and Do you trust your government?,"I agree with the writer who suggests reading the book first. I think you have to have an open mind and not simply ingest everything the government tells you. I can tell you that unless you have seen the ""head snap"" that the author refers to in this book which is clearly evident in the videotape obtained by Abraham Zapruder, your comment might as well be as full of agitation as the longwinded one by David V.P. I witnessed this clip out of the videotape and I am convinced- as in CONVINCED, that at least one (1) shot came from the front. Well, how can that be? The TX book depository was way in back. Just follow the motorcade route and simply ""Look at it"". Open your mind and free your mind enough to be able to ask a logical question. Don't just eat up everything the government gives you. P. in NY"
1,Lifton is nuts,This book is garbage for the simple fact that Kennedy's body was NEVER left alone. Not for a second. Anyone who believes this book is in need of a mental evaluation.
2,Most Incredible Theory Ever,"Lifton's book is one of the strangest I've read. In part, it is very confusing and does not appear to ""connect all the dots"" about how and when all the physical evidence was altered. In other words, the theory tends to fall of its own weight. If any of it is true, however, it would mean the conspiracy to assassinate JFK was deep and wide.Personally, I was very suspicious about Lifton's writings and wondered whether the information presented falls into the category of government ""disinformation"". I hope not. But this theory is one of the most incredible and fascinating reads."
5,The book is riveting,"If described in one page, the thesis does seem fantastic. However, I ask those who are skeptical to actually read the book before dismissing the idea. The fact is the book is extremely well researched and convincingly argued. I have read many books - both pro-conspiracy and con-conspiracy - but I think Lifton's book brings us closest to the truth of what happened that day."
4,"although largely debunked, still of value","Although Harry Livingstone largely debunked this book, it is still of value, as Lifton was a true pioneer in getting a hold of many of the medical witnesses. Of particular note are his interviews with former Secret Service agent Bill Greer.Vince PalamaraHistory Channel, author of two books, in over 32 other author's books, etc."

4,"Above-average performances, but...","...well, both concertos as as writen above - not the best, but above-average for sure. Masquerade suite with maestro Stanley Black is excellent. Everything OK up to now - but here it comes: the most important work of the two-cd set, Khachaturian's rarely recorded Symphony No.2 (only two other recordings exist - scandalous, because it is a masterpiece!), is superb, ultimate preformance - far far best from all available, but the recording quality of the symphony is TERRIBLE. I do not often complain for sound quality of recordings, but in this case, it is simply unacceptable. The sound frays out often in heights, and in way, which will cause you pain, if volume is up. Whole recording is way too sharp, that's the problem. Big dishonour for Decca, but sound problems are not rare with this label... Really annoying, beacause the syphony is perfromed so so perfectly."
4,Good performance from relatively young Larrocha,"Although we have a definitive recording for Khachatrian piano concerto, i.e., William Kapell's one, this is still worth hearing, especially if you like Alicia de Larrocha and don't know her other than Spanish music. This is a good example proving that she is really a complete pianist, not just a Spanish piano music specialist.I think that her other concerto recordings (Ravel Piano Concertos (for both hands & left hand), Rachmaninov No.2 & 3(!!), Chopin No.2, Franck ""Symphonic Variations"", Faure ""Fantasie"", Falla ""Nights in the Gardens of Spain"", Mozart No.25 & 27, etc.) during her Decca/London-era in the 70s should be reissued and heard much more."
4,A great Beginning,"This was Mrs. Kurtz chance to introduce her readers to characters that time and again she manages to bring to life, vividly. I think she did an incredible job. This is the novel that helps you fall in love with Gwynedd, Kelson, Morgan, Duncan, and the deryni race in general. Not to mention her story is riveting and keeps the readers attention throughout. I highly recommend this novel(and entire seiries) to everyone I know."
3,Inoffensive light reading,"I found this book to be a pleasant read. The characters were interesting and the plot was well paced. I thought the overall story was too simple, but for a book of less than 300 pages it was as much as you might expect. I thought the Latin references were out of place and the incantations were a bit trite. There wasn't enough here to keep me reading the series, but it's a likeable book anyway. Reads well as a stand-alone novel, and good to share with younger readers."
2,I don't see whats to like about this book,"I picked up this book on a recommendation of a complete stranger that i met at a book store. i was looking for a good book and he said that this was one of his favorates. So I took it home and started the book. The beginning of the book has some promise, but as it goes along, it becomes painfully boring. The author gives you just enough detail to where you can imagine what is going on but that is all. So, i held on to the idea that this was someones favorate book and continued to read...it remained boring. Its only saving grace is that the last chapter was pretty entertaining, but no where near amazing. The epic battle between the young prince and the evil woman reminded me of Merlin vs Mad Madam Mim from the Sword in the stone cartoon. my $.02"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In a Welsh type fantasy kingdom, magic exists, and, of course, runs in the blood of the nobility, hence they get to be in charge.Their version of the Catholic Church is also powerful, so this is a cause for conflict, church versus the royals, and church vs magic.This all leads up to a violent ritual confrontation over the right to be in charge, by the end, as a new prince has to establish himself after the dead of his old man."
1,Why Waste the Time?,"The characters in this book are all either absolutely good or absolutely evil and very much stereotyped: the young prince, the evil sorceress, etc. My other main criticism is that the author tells you everything each character is thinking, leaving almost no room for suspense. Oh and if you aren't a devout Christian this book will probably be a bit much, too.Hopefully the other books in the series are better than this one!"
5,"Read this book, you will enjoy it.","This is one book you can unrepentantly recommend to any person, whether they are a fantasy reader or not. I have recommended this book to many many people, from all reading bacgrounds and never once have they come back dissapointed, usually they buy the next two.Ignore it's simplicity, it is a unique stroy, with characters that are engaging. Who doesen't want to read a book, every once in a while, where you can love to hate the bad guy and love to love the good guy! Ala star wars etc...As far as the non-glossed over view of the ""Church"", you might find that it simply reflects most of the very true documented history of the Catholic Church. It wholly enhances the read!Read and enjoy! BTW, don't let the old artwork throw you!"
3,Poorly organized!,"The book is poorly organized. However, many of the authors did give some details information on some topics. I like the appendix the best! However, I think because it is written by many authors, there are duplicated topics JUMPING here and there."
5,Beautiful!,"This tablecloth is gorgeous. It does look a little different than the photo above, but it is every bit as pretty."
4,fast shipping!,This product shipped quickly and came In nice protective packaging. the mix though has kind of a weird lime taste and is VERY salty. I honestly would prefer real salt and a real lime to whatever is in that bottle. still fast shipping and not a particularly bad taste in a beer it gets 4 of 5.
3,packaging problem,"Enjoyed the product very much, what was left of it. I ordered two bottles of Micheladas mix, one Picante and one Salmon. The Salmon bottle lid had failed and half the mix had leaked out, making for a smelly, messy shipping box. I don't know what happened. Hope it wasn't a disgruntled employee! I do enjoy the product and may reorder at a later date, but we've got to work on quality control."
5,high quality,It is of the original high quality as said in the showing of it and I remember. of my first one
4,Family Affair,"I loved Childress Street. I loved it because I saw my own family in that book on so many levels. It was a story that I would have never had the talent to tell, but certainly have lived inside of. Kenji Jasper is a writers writer. While it can be a little challenging to follow the family tree, it is worth while because it initiates self reflection. Kenji Japser's story telling is amazing...but his comentary is even better. That is what makes Childress Street different from any of his other books. And the fasinating thing that happens at the end is wonderful.Keep it up Kenji Jasper."
3,Best He's Written,"I think with this one, I've read all of Jasper's novels and I have to say this one was the best. Jasper starts off with the intention of writing about his grandfather, Jesse. Unfortunately, Jesse dies before Jasper can start the interview process so, he has to obtain insight about Jesse, the Lone Ranger, through the eyes of Jesse's children, brothers and other family members. It's sad that Jesse didn't live long enough for his real life story to be told. This results in the book being a mix of memories of Jesse and Jasper's memoirs. We don't really know what Jesse thought, felt, or actually experienced. We don't really know why he was such a hard-nosed husband and father. We do know that his family loved and respected him so, I guess that's all that matters."
3,not quite up to snuff,"I normally wouldn't dare to say anything negative about a Guy Clark cd, but all of the rave reviews here need some balance. To put my opinion in perspective, Guy Clark is my favorite artist and I own all of his albums (including the LPs of his 3 warner bros. albums that you can only get on ""Craftsman""). That said, this is his ""worst"" record (none of them are bad), and with the quality of all his other albums, I rarely ever listen to this one. I believe one reason is that ALL of the songs are co-written with other artists. That is not something that Guy did in his prime, although he has been leaning more towards that practice recently, perhaps by design. In any event, my point is, you may want to listen to the album before you buy to make sure the $17 is worth it. As for myself, if I had it to do all over again, I would have burned a copy from a friend. If you a relative newcomer to Guy Clark, begin with Old No. 1, Texas Cookin', and Dublin Blues."
4,Very real lyrics,"Guy Clark is probably one of the strongest songwriters to come out of Texas. His folky-alt country tunes have been covered by many other artists--particularly ""LA Freeway.""One thing about Clark is he tells it like it is. ""Soldier's Joy, 1864"" tells you almost exactly what it's like for a Civil War soldier to have a leg with gangrene amputated.""Bag of Bones"" talks about what it's like to grow old still anchored to an ancient body with a spirit flying free.""Homeless"" is a heartwrenching and true tale of what it's like to live on the streets. Again, no punches pulled. You don't want to have your heart broken, don't listen to this one.The collection's excellent for any other singer-songwriter, but it's not one of Guy's best. My personal favorite of his is still ""Workbench Songs"" but the CD is well worth a listen and if you love folky country, a purchase as well.Rebecca Kyle, May 2008"
3,"Enjoyable, but...","I got interested in vampires after watching ""Interview with the Vampire,"" and I have loved Robert R. McCammon's books for years. I was really excited about this book. I enjoyed reading most of the stories in this collection. However, the one called ""Behind Enemy Lines"" by Dan Perez was really stupid. A real disappointment to an otherwise good book."
4,A book to read just before you sleep,"A very good idea: the vampires have taken over, mankind is on retreat or defeated. This is the setting. Most of the authors could cope with this given situation and their stories are really good. Some of them did not really write good stories. But they are readable. The best is the first story by Robert McCammon himself."
4,Totally Exciting and Almost Believable,"This book is by far one of the greatest anthologies of vampire stories I've ever read. Picture these blood-suckers taking over the world, and how you would re-act as one of the few mortal men left."
5,A MUST HAVE for GNX4 owners,"Written in a manner to get you up and running fast. Unlike the manual, this book focus's on what you need to know to use the pedal effectively in a straightforward manner. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
2,title,"It's a nice cardigan, but slightly more fitted than I thought. I will wear it alone when it is cool enough, but cannot wear it when air conditioning in the office is too much. It's a different use than that for which I bought it but will work and look nice."
1,Not Satisfied with this sweater,This is very low quality and the color of the sweater is old and faded.I bought Black and navy blue both looked like old faded.I don't want to return because i bought at cheap price and will use while staying home.
3,Not as Good as I thought.,I had forgotten that I had bought this book way back when it first came out and thought it was okay. The story needed more beauty and the beast like interaction and less of dealing with outside influences.
4,Excellent program of delightful French music,"I thought that this disc was excellent. This was my first Poulenc CD and I have to say that Poulenc is a fascinating composer. The Piano Concerto is quite lovely. I really enjoyed the Organ Concerto; the balance between orchestra and organ was excellent. The two-piano concerto had drive and was exciting throughout. The Concert Champetre was interesting for its use of the harpsichord, a instrument which really has its home in baroque music. I have only one problem with this disc. I think that the sound could be better. On the Concert Champetre, it is difficult to hear the harpsichord sometimes. The sound on the two-piano concerto is sufficient, but one could wish for even better sound. Other than that quibble, I thought the disc was great. It is difficult to find one CD set with this many different pieces by Poulenc, so it's welcomed. Four stars."
4,It's Cool,"I think it was a little better in 2004 but it's still a nice mag! For those who love Celeberity gossip (like myself) except I wish it would ""grow up"" a bit- but I still wanna subscription for it!!!!!!!! The quizzes are really cool plus theres no health crap like in SEVENTEEN- so I'd reccomend this."
4,Great for Your Tween,I bought this subscription as a gift for my 10 year old daughter who just loves these types of magazines. This one seems to be the best of the bunch with lots of posters and all her favorite stars (everyone affliated with Disney or Teen Nick). At the time of purchase it was the best deal for the amount of issues received.
1,Magazine is great but the publisher is terrible,"My daughter loved the subscription, which I gave her as a gift. BUT...When we moved, no amount of phonecalls, emails, or other attempts to contact the publisher to change our address were ever sucessful, even now. I first used the Popstar website, and thought that was done... when weeks later there was no magazine I called their phone and left a message with the address change... a week after that they called me back, and said they had no record of ANY change of address (!), but said they'd handle it... it's now two months later and we haven't seen an issue in three months, and there is no one to contact.Very frustrating that half of my purchase is just down the toilet."
3,Pre Teen Magazine,"With the approval of her parents, we ordered this magazine for our nine year old granddaughter who was delighted to receive it."
2,Stars in your eyes,"Now, this magazine is good if you are looking for information on todays pop stars. But I personally don't like it. The magazine is nothing more than a star obbsessed read. When I read a magazine I want to read about fun, helpful life articles and this definetley is not it. If you are looking for Pop stars than this is for you but if you are looking for something with a little less star appeal and a bit more realism this magazine isn't for you. And I am one of those people."
3,there is better teen magizines out there.,I personally think there are just better magizines than popstar.unless you are REALLY desprate and have abloutley nothing to read than i guess sure pick up popstar. It filled with mostly poster and more stupid gossip for younger viewers like 9 year old.
1,The WORST Magazine,"I started reading this magazine because i needed something to read, but I stopped right away. Thr articles are pointless, because you can buy another magazine and see the same information, and same with the pictures. The editors of this magazine put exclamation points basically after every single sentence, none of which were exciting at all. Maybe i just hate Pop Star! just because i don't care for celebrity magazines. Or maybe not. But the only people I would recommend this magazine to is children under 10 years of age."
1,Pointless,I use to buy this magazine every mouth when I was much younger which was just a big waste of money all the stories and pictures can be found in any other teen bop magazine. This magazine is not for people who can actually read or understand any of the stories.
1,boooooooooring!,this is a really bad magazine! order m magazine or j-14 'cause there a lot better or if you're like 15-17yrs old then u should read twist mag 'cause its 4 older teens and the other ones (in my opinon) are for younger teens.
1,Be aware of the seller Warehouse Deals for this product,"Warehouse Deals is running a scam operation with this black light bulb. They say ""1 of: GE 25905 60-Watt A19 Black Light Bulb, 6-Pack"" and make you think you are getting ONE 6-Pack of bulbs when in fact they are giving you only ONE bulb. I'd rate the bulb a five if it weren't for the scam operation."
5,Music and words...,Rarely do the two come together in such a union... Here's to this single star that stands out in the dark. Thank you Billy for the great ride - dr
3,Excellent Idea With Poor Execution,"What I got was less than I expected. although a heartrending story, the telling relies too heavily on quotes from Shakespeare to convey less than unique ideas. Still, the author manages to tell a good story and pull on the heartstrings. I recommend it for anyone who had a tough time knowing ther Dad, as they would get this sotry better than anoyone else and be able to fill in the gaps."
5,The most thought provoking book I have read...,"I just finished this absolutely mesmerizing tale (or really two tales in one) and have come back to order kamikaze cowboy. Not everyone could open up his or her lives like this, but this is a life worth sharing. It is so refreshing and exhilarating to see such a fine actor have such other admirable qualities and the ability to articulate them to the world. I spent my afternoon curled up with this book, and read it cover to cover in one sitting. After all the books I've been required to read by higher education, by the so-called best writers, they all pale in comparison to And Then We Went Fishing: A Story of Fatherhood, Fate and Forgiveness. I recommend this book to everyone and anyone!"
2,2.5 stars.,"I purchased this album after having heard the single ""Spin Moon Magic"" which presented a unique gothic type of sound with exotic vocals and an edge of eerinees. Unfortunately, the rest of the album didnt follow in its single's footsteps. The rest of the album was pretty monotonous for the most part. It provided me with little interest after only about two listens and I haven't listened to it again since. Most of the songs sound way too much alike, a lot of the songs fit the same exact tempo, and the vocalist goes in and out of key at times, which can be very distracting and definitely takes away from the music- not that there's too much to like- at times.I wouldn't suggest this album unless you're looking for something to bore you to sleep."
5,Moves right along,"Yeah, I don't get why this show had to go either. Unlike those of many sci-fi series, the writers of Surface didn't tease us with vague, shadowy figures and boring side stories. They moved the action along week after week, delivering a payoff and a cliffhanger with each episode. When you consider where the 15th chapter ended, you have to think that the future storyline is terrific. I suppose it's too much to hope that scifi channel would pick this up."
5,Cover up blues,"A series that had the potential to last for more than one season. Highly possible that creatures of this type are being developed in the world today through genetic engineering. The big question as to why the series was cancelled is ""Did the producer and network hit too close to reality?"" We may never know. Hopefully someone will take up the banner and finish the series."
4,Yes!!! Sci Fi at its Best!!! A real hook to watch!!,"Hello, I would call myself the queen of Really Good B rated movies....And this by no means is a B series..... I sell and buy several movies so I've been at this for ""years""...To get to the point, this series is a surprise! It hooks you right off the bat and you wonder who in their right mind didn't want this series to continue... It must have been up against Star Trek or something to be cancelled.... Well, its got all the stuff you want,,,,Sci Fi,,, Danger, Creatures,,people you hate to like,, crazy people and A very smart women... I'm sure the boys will like it for the little teen agers that run around half naked. Really if you get over the teenagers, you get to the interesting plot of sea creatures back to life (huge!) from ulongs ago.....A must for any respectable Sci Fi fan......Susan from Washington"
2,the (in)complete series,"I very much liked this show, but if they didnt lie about it being a complete series, i would have felt quite different about it. I was unaware of the MEGA cliffhanger that ends the series and only makes me bitter about wasting 13 hours of my life watching a show that leaves such little satisfaction at the end. it was a great show, and deserves to be concluded. they should consider calling the the DVD the INCOMPLETE series, as that is exactly what it is. very dissappointing :("
4,What happened in the end,"Saw the begining of the series on Pay TV and I liked what I saw. The possibility of scientests fiddling with nature is a great possibility now-a-days. I liked the story but waiting for the next issue every week I wanted to know what happened, so I obtained to series. At the end of the series I'm glad that both Miles and his girlfriend with Rich and Laura end up in a bell tower with the tidal waves (Yes, I still call them tidal waves, it's sounds better than tsunami), and that's where it ended. Still questions to answer. Is there a second series coming or am I going to be left guessing ""What happens now?"""
4,Nimrod lives,"After we watched this about 2-3 years ago we noticed that a pathetic little street cat born out behind our house made the same weird noises as Nimrod the alien space lizard so we adopted him and named him Nimrod, or Nimmy for short. He practically doesn't meow, just makes alien space lizard noises. But he doesn't kill anything. I bet he doesn't know why we called him Nimrod. Decent show, picked up speed and was definitely capable of building to something better."
1,Not Playable in Region 1?,"What do you mean?U.S. customers can buy it but not watch it?What's up with that?All I can say is: ""I HATE NBC!""The show is 5 STARS, but ""may not be playable in Region 1 DVD plays"" brings it down to a 1.(Love the show, Hate NBC)"
1,Seaquest DSV + X-Filles + Loch Ness Monster = Surface,"How could NBC screw up the same TV show twice? Surface is a classic example of why the major networks CANNOT make a decent Sci-Fi show.Spielberg and NBC keep trying to make a ""risk-free"" science fiction show. First with Seaquest DSV, which never got out of its own way, then with the yawn-inspiring ""Surface"".Science Fiction, by its very nature, should try to take risks - examine issues in a new, innovative light. DSV was a bad, waterlogged remake of Star Trek. Surface is a much less cohesive show, spinninng from one Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre (X-Files) to the next. It reminds me of a long ""Amazing Stories"" episode, half written by Chris Carter.If you blinked, you probably missed seeing this show on network TV. I suggest that you keep missing it."
3,Surface - An entertaining show,"Surface was a good show, the special effect were not very good most of the time but, it had action, suspence, sci-fi, mystery. What I did not like was that if often was very focused on that kid Miles, that was not very interesting to me."
4,Not given proper backing,"Otherwise this show would have and should have done some really great things in the sci-fi arena. It was a great show with some good quality characters and actors/actresses playing them. I bothers me that this show ends in such way that a movie does when just know that there is going to be a sequel. Dont get me wrong i love the show and everything, but for the powers that be to put this out and say The Complete Series. It should've been just that complete with a solid and credible ending..as it stands i couldnt give it five stars. Great story with some bumps here and there, but the plotline was cool overall. Wished Surface could've been given its due and everything. It would've made a good impact on TV if that happened."
3,a bit slow,"I started the series a couple of time, and I have to admit that the plot starts very slowly. I will try again in the near future."
4,Great Sci-Fi,"This was my favorite of the three new sci-fi shows included in the ""new season"" last year. I think it cruel to leave all the viewers hanging without proper closer to the series. At the very least a ""made-for t-v"" movie should be made to give us fans the ending of the story.I gave this 4 stars instead of the 5 it derserves only because the network has not given us the story ending the show and the fans deserve."
2,Why Botha.....,"I looked forward to each and every episode - and hoped against hope that there would be a ""button-up"" episode at the end. NBC's promo for the final episode was ""all your questions will be answered"". Who would buy a truncated series? I, for one, won't torture myself."
3,WHAT NO SECOND SEASON!,"I love this show, but I can not belive its not coming back for a second season. I started watching this show on scifi and I loved it but it does not have a ending, I really wanted to see it. I would give the show 5 stars but with no second season it goes down to 3."
5,"""SURFACE"" 4-DVD set! Best price at AMAZON!","I don't know how I missed this series. Great effects, actors, sound! If you like a bargain order this set for the SCI FI Fan! From deep craters on the bottom of the ocean to massive sounds from a megabeast eating whales! 'nuff said! Enjoy!"
2,TWO EPISODES WAS ENOUGH FOR ME,I watched the first two episodes of this tale but didn't care for it. The kids hiding a baby monster was barely amusing and the investigation of some unknown creature in the water took too long for build up and it wasn't like we didn't know what it was likely to be in the first place. WHEN WATCHED: February 2012 (streamed on Netflix); OVERALL GRADE: C to C plus.
4,Cheap thrills,"Science fiction is rarely featured on commercial TV, especially by the big 3 of CBS, ABC and NBC. This was a rare exception. Focusing on the hear and now, the show is about the emergence of a marine creature on Earth, and the changes in the lives of about a dozen characters as this occurs. Mixing comedy, action, family drama and a little suspense, this show was a good mix of sci-fi effects and believable dialogue. Unfortunately, it ended after one season, just as the show was getting interesting. The show features mainly smaller-name actors and actresses, but uses them quite well. The show also has a good amount of surprises thrown in, though any avid sci-fi fan would have probably guessed the human origins of the new creatures by the end of the 2nd or 3rd episode. Still, a good waste of time on a long afternoon."
1,"Great Series, Myopic Networks","I can really only echo the opinions expressed by others. This along with Invasion were my weekly treats this past season. I have rarely in recent years anticipated new episodes as I did this year. Unfortuntely I was out of the country when this series ended , or perhaps fortunately since that means the DVD will hold some treats for me.... I'm saddened that neither Surface nor Invasion will be returning - it would be nice if, perhaps, the sci fi channel would take these on. I've come to exect the major networks to drop sci-fi series on the slightest pretext, I swore off Fox after they dropped Above and Beyond years ago. At least Sci Fi brought back Farscape for a 2 part miniseries. The networks, just kaboom.... nothing, leave the viewers hanging..."
3,Surface - The series,"It was OK, not as intense as I thought it was supposed to be. Good to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do."
3,Good Exciting Show,"This Was A Lot Of Fun To Watch, But I Am So Sad That The Show Was Canceled, The Execs Should Finish Out The Series."
5,"Loved it, don't know why the show was cancelled!","I just loved this show, and Invasion. I love well written shows, and this one fit the criteria! Anyone who loves sci-fi will appreciate this. I have no idea why a show like this, or Invasion would be axed after the first season. I am a fan of Heroes, but these show held more intrigue to me. It just wasn't given the chance to grab it's audience. These shows were genius with such suspenseful cliffhangers, and yet that is all we're left with. A huge open void of interest which was never filled. I want answers damn it! Drowned out by cheaply made crappy reality shows about no talent hacks, with no scripts or writers. Bring back the sci-fi dramas! The writers strike is over, bring on the juicy plots, filled with suspense! Bring back Surface and Invasion!"
5,Surface more enjoyable on DVD,"We loved the mini-series on NBC, but seeing the show without commercials and without waiting a week for each new episode was much more enjoyable. Just finished viewing the entire series, and ready to watch it again. Good value as the series package was in the twenty dollar price point. If you liked the show, own it for yourself and watch it again any time."
5,LEFT DANGLING FOR CLOSURE OF SERIES,"I JUST WATCHED THIS SERIES THROUGH NET FLIX, HOWEVER WOULD NEVER HAVE STARTED IT, HAD I KNOWN THAT WE WOULD BE LEFT DANGLING WITH A HOARD OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. WHEN ARE THE NET WORKS GOING TO LEARN HOW IT TICKS OFF THE VIEWER WHEN WE ARE CONSTANTLY LEFT IN THE DARK WAITING FOR AN ENDING. HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THIS PRODUCTIONUNTIL I FOUND IT THRU NET FLIX, WHICH SHOWS IT WOULD HAVE HAD A HECK OF A LOT MORE VIEWERS IF THEY HAD BOTHERED TO ADVERTISE IT MORE. SAME HAPPENED WITH MOONLIGHT, THE BEST VAMPIRE SERIES OF ALL TIME. INSTEAD OF FIRING OUR FAVOURITE SHOWS, THEY SHOULD FIRE THE EXECUTIVES IN CHARGE WHO PROBABLY NEVER PERSONALLY WATCHED THEM. THE LEAST THEY COULD DO FOR THE FANS OF THESE SHOWS IS TO FILM A CONCLUSION EPISODE AND NOT LEAVE US HANGING."
2,Bring back surface,"I love this series, and I want to see the ending so BRING IT BACK! Please........I will buy this dvd. I gave this dvd 2 stars because there is no second season, but the show gets 5 stars."
4,Have to admit I enjoyed this,"It's kind of a weird premise, the storyline is almost jagged at first. But I was constantly held in suspense and satisfied with the drama. The production value was pretty good too, effects were not bad, though a little lacking (as with most of these 1990-2002 sci-fi/fantasy series).The story came to perfect cohesion just in time for it to end. Another sad episode of good tv dying. It's like these shows have some feature that won't sell, even though they're awesome stories. Surface was a well thought story, and good if not a little weird. And that was okay, I was perfectly happy with the story, I just wanted MORE.Firefly, Caprica, Enterprise, Defying Gravity, another one bites the dust..BTW: This show is a little dated by now. If you have no tolerance for an episode of X-Files because it's 90's production, probably pass this up and get yourself some Walking Dead."
5,Great Music!,I loved every song....Constantine make you feel like he is singing just for you!!!! A must buy for everyone on your Christmas list!!
4,Cheesy but delicious.,"Some great songs, some okay songs, none are bad. All the vocals are excellent. It's not a classic but it's a definite feelgood for a fan!"
3,Constantine CD Review,"I liked it. I was a fan of his when he was on ""American Idol"", and continue to enjoy his music."
5,Best Post Idol Record!,"I didn't expect to like this record this much. It benefits from superior songwriting compared to most in the genre and tasteful vocal stylings by Constantine. My favorites include Child of the Revolution, Fading Into You, and Right To My Head. Been playing it every day for a week!"
5,Worth the wait . . .,Constantine's cd is better than I anticipated. His voice is so pure and this cd demonstrates that he can do it all. I have listened to this eclectic collection of tunes over and over since the day it was released and I still find myself reaching for it first for an evening of relaxing and listening to music.
5,AWESOME CD,"This is one of the best cd's I have bought!! I LOVE every song! If you are thinking about buying it and are not sure, BUY it you will love it! Constantine's voice is wonderful on this cd, his falsettos are to die for!Did I say I LOVE this cd? It is worth repeating!"
1,Cheap,"Sound like it was some band practicing in the basement or on the garage,rough finish, instruments sounds like tin cans"
1,God Awful!,"This album and material is horrible! Like the other reviewers said, sounds like a garage band playing with dime store instruments. I won't be buying it. This is not the Con I heard on AI. He may wish to prove 19 wrong about not taking a chance on him, but I think this release proves them right in refusing to gamble on him. I love good music, but I have to say I'm disappointed. What the heck is this and what was Con thinking? Even with creative control on an independant label, Con had one chance to prove he could rock and he blew it."
5,AWESOME DEBUT CD,"I am a huge Constantine fan and have been anxiously awaiting this for years. I think the CD is awesome, very diverse, something for everyone. Especially love the ballads! Looking forward to the next one and the next one..."
5,FINALLY,"Every song on this long awaited CD is pure Constantine. He stayed true to himself and his fans. I personally think he did a fantastic job, and love how each song is different with its own unique sound. Buy this CD and you won't be disappointed."
5,I've been waiting for a CD like this ...,"Got my CD from Amazon today in the mail. Except for ""Girl Like You"" and ""Everybody Loves"" which I've heard on Constantine's website, this was the first time I've heard the other songs. I purposely kept away from sampling the others. SO glad I did, since listening for the first time became much more special for me. I'm ""in love"" with Constantine all over again!I'm writing this review after listening to the CD only twice through. I especially love ""Midnight Radio"", ""Several Thousand"", ""Sister, Sister"" (even though I have three brothers and no sister) and, of course, ""Girl Like You"". There are two I don't particularly care for, ""Child, You're The Revolution"" and ""Right To My Head"", which is strange since I even like hard rock and enjoy the ""Pray for the Soul of Betty"" CD.All in all, I'm so very happy with this CD and wish Constantine much success."
2,"Good voice, but disappointing mishmash of a CD","I was a Constantine fan when he was on American Idol and it's plain that he retains his excellent voice, but the CD is all over the map in terms of music genres. The guy needs to decide who he is before he attempts this again. For something that took 2.5 years to produce, I expected something more polished and cohesive. I understand that it was partially produced and/or mixed in someone's living room. Unfortunately, that comes through loud and clear. More professionalism in the production values would have helped immensely. There are a few catchy tunes on there but overall, it's a disappointment."
5,"A great read, especially if you're in the mood to contemplate","I was hooked after reading the first couple paragraphs. Must've been the narrative, and the allure of that one perfect painting that led our protagonist to an early retirement in a small New England town far from childhood. Life becomes routine and uneventful, until a young stranger lands at his door and proves the ultimate acid test.So glad I stumbled upon this at my local library, as I was looking for something else at the time. Why is it that the best books are the ones discovered by accident? Maybe I'm just lucky, but I'll take it."
5,Best Memoir I've Read - and I read a few,"I just finished ""The Language of Baklava"" and loved the style, the honesty, the capture of nuances and details, and sense of humor. Having read many excellent food, travel, immigrant or multiethnic memoirists, this surpasses them all.As an Arab immigrant, I laughed out loud at the precise and non judgmental accounts contrasting Arab and American ways. I will strongly recommend this book to my American wife who is incessantly befuddled by my family's behavior when they visit or we visit them.This book is beyond food memories, it should be a classic of growing up as an immigrant's offspring. Diana Abu Jaber has a wonderful gift of making us feel with her and for her; of making us laugh and cry with her."
4,an excellent introduction to Janacek's music,"The first disk of this work is an excellent introduction to Janacek's music. Although it might seem odd that a British conductor leading the Vienna Phil would be the prime exponent of this body of work, Mackerras' recording of the Sinfonietta is probably the best on disk today, though Rattle's is also good. I have to admit a personal preference to the Kubelik DG recording, but, to my knowledge, it is only available on vinyl. The performance (and recording!) of Taras Bulba is excellent, as well.My own preference would have been for a single disk recording. The Sinfonietta, Taras Bulba, and the Lachian Dances are probably sufficient, and the typical listener is not well-served by the additional disk (and additional cost!)."
4,A wonderful recording,"I have always wanted my own recording of the uplifting and exciting Sinfonietta. The others pieces are OK, but not my favorite."
3,In the foreground of backgrounds,"One of those meekly strong, Tortoise-esque strains that did a whole lot of consistently good but not very much stand-out great."

5,Excellent sound,I use these as surround speakers. I am not as informed about these speakers compared to someone who uses them as their main speakers. Surround speakers dont receive as much volume and sound as the center channel and front left and right speakers. But so far everything sounds great with them. I cant count the times I have literally looked over my should thinking there was a real car by my side or tree's/bushes rustling near me. They sound that good. And these things are extremely well made. JBL Pro knows what they are doing.
3,These are NOT powered!,"Even though these are described as 150w studio monitors, they are NOT powered. How can you call it a studio monitor if it's not powered? This is just a regular speaker. Buyer beware."
3,First effort from a now vastly improved author,"My introduction to Adrian McKinty was FIFTY GRAND, a thriller which really grabbed me. Anxious to read more by the author, I read DEAD I MAY WELL BE which again was a gripping crime odyessy. And then I chose to read this, his first novel.McKinty's power and skill shows here, but it falls far short of his more recent writing. I found this difficult to get through while his later fiction has kept me reading without a break for quite long periods of time. This story is told from two distinct perspectives, but neither seemed truly authentic to me. The heavy use of Irish slang which had me constantly referring to the glossary at the end of the book was a further hindrance to my becoming fully engrossed.If you haven't read anything by this author yet, I suggest that you first read FIFTY GRAND or DEAD I MAY WELL BE. If you pick this one first, you may not feel encouraged to read his later fiction and that would be a shame."
3,For ideas on how to pack creative lunches...,"The information and ideas presented in this book are basically flawless and oh so helpful. However, the big disappointment is in the recipes which are easy, yes, but unappetizing. I'm all for having an adventurous palate, but unless you're a pregnant woman with unusual cravings, most of the recipes will not appeal to the average adult, much less the average schoolchild. Still, if all you're looking for are ideas on lunch packing and presentation, it would be simple enough to substitute your and your family's favorite dishes."
3,So glad to have found this book again....,"I can't find my old copy....Yes, it is certainly a VERY ""Earthy - Crunchy"" offering. But there is a recipe for tofu spread that ROCKS in this book...I am buying the whole book - just for that recipe. It is amazing!!!! I can't remember using much else from this book. But - the TOFU spread is worth the price of admission!"
3,"An easy to read bio, followed by the author's viewpoints",The title of the book was a little misleading. This is not a typical principle-oriented or psychology book in business management. The first few chapters were written in a story telling style of the author's biography. The view point started to pick up after chapter 11 so don't give up before that.
4,A Band to Watch Out for,"This Virginia (DC suburb) band is truly amazing live. And while the CD didn't floor me like their live performances, its a nice breath of fresh air after a day of monotonous radio with pre-packaged music. Blue and When in Rome are my favorites. I can't wait to see what they come out with after a few years experience behind them!"
5,My favorite tea!,"Thank you Amazon for carrying this product. I fell in love with this tea and then all the stores around my home stopped carrying it. I was so thrilled when I found I could order this online through Amazon.I'm not sure why I like this tea so much, except that if you can only drink decaf products and like green tea as I do, then the options are very limited. This one is by far the best I've tried over the years. I even pack several bags when I travel so I always have it with me wherever I go."
2,Honey flavor a bit strong,"I really like the Lipton decaf green tea and I always add lemon so I thought this would be the way to go, but the honey flavor is a little too strong for me. I also have found the tea bags to be more flimsy than the decaf green tea without the honey and lemon and if you are not careful when pulling the string the bag will tear."
1,Bad,"This was oddly bad tasting----both of us thought. I'll stick with just Green tea with honey OR lemon. Apparantly, Lipton did something wrong in trying combine the two (who'd have guessed?!). The other 5 boxes have been sitting around getting dusty and taking up space...I'd feel bad even giving this away!"
1,TASTE IS DECEIVING & DISGUSTING,"I agree with C. Wright! This thing is all levels of nasty. I bought this thinking I'd get the flavor of regular green tea with added lemon and honey but nooooo doesn't taste anything like it. If you read the ingredients it doesn't even mention honey or lemon (lemon grass doesn't count). Not sure how to describe the taste but it's very strong and herby. Better stick to the regular green tea and just add lemon and honey yourself. I had to hold my nose drinking it cuz I didn't want to waste the cup of it I made. But in short, DON'T BUY IT!"
5,"Like Pynchon, if he were fun to read.","I found this book to be a perfect read. A few caveats: I did not read it for a literature class but literally found it while on vacation. I picked it up because of the cheesy cover art. Given those initial conditions, I was very far from disappointed. Man is it pulpy, fleshy and pulpy. Beyond that, I found the writing style to be a laugh out loud interplay with the outlandish narrative. As for the outlandish narrative, it covers a lot of terrain. The continual, historical and literary references kept me scratching my head at the actual thought and effort that went into its writing. One reviewer found these references pretentious and the authors ""pretentions to moral superiority"" insufferable. I found them charming. What better attitude to affect than moral superiority while you enjoy some carnal and carnage poking?"
4,Let's Give the Devil His Due,"This is a quite well-written fantasy romp where the hero gets to sexually humiliate a high society WASP named Glenda who secretly supports the Nazis. It's pretty clear that the author identifies with the narrator's anti-WASP bigotry (not just his anti-fascism). Reading it is sort of a masochistic experience for those of us who are WASP's and love our people. Fun, though definitely written by one of our enemies."
5,would love this to be re-issued,"Spooky and danceable. Appropriately rationed polka beats. Banjo, vocals, free bass accordion, tuba, drums, trombone. Captures an urgency of existence (or something). Slag-heap imagery... Appalachia represent! Some ruffian stole my CD... please re-release."
5,Value and quality,"The amazing price of this harp might steer someone away from it thinking it must be low quality. I've been playing Johnsons for several years and find they play well and are very durable. It wasn't until I started thinking my original Johnson harps, which were a gift from a dear friend, might need replacing at some point that I discovered how inexpensive they were."
4,Throw back (In a Good Way) !,"Yea, I bought the Johnson for my nephew, and he loves it. I have to get one myself now! a beauty of an instrument. thank you!"
3,"fell apart, but the kids were rough with 'em.","i have no idea how these harmonica's will fare in adult/caring hands, but my 6 year olds tore these suckers up! they fell apart. but they sounded good while they lasted, but the sound wasn't especially sweet. i doubt they are ""professional"" harmonica's.bottom line, you get what you pay for, and then it will only last as long as you care for it properly."
3,"Terse introduction, no reference material","There was more introductory and expository material in the book than I would have expected for a pocket guide weighing in it only a scant 150 pages. In addition, the reference I would have expected, which would allow me to navigate an RTF exported from Word, I did not find.I recommend this to anyone who has some experience working with RTF and who wants to try to actually understand it. For those looking for an RTF decoder ring, you won't find it here."
4,Informative content,"This is _the one_ book out there I could find about RTF language. RTF language is quirky and not intuitive, at least to me. This book clears a whole lot of my questions. The content is informative and well organized. Perhaps the one issue I noticed is a need for more examples in it. Overall, I recommend this book."
4,The RTF Pocket Guide - A Review,"Sean M Burke has written the RTF Pocket Guide, The RTF Cookbook and other technical materials on the Rich Text Format (RTF). These writings are worthwhile, and should be mandatory reading for anyone attempting to program RTF readers or writers.In my case, I needed to produce neat, printable reports from an Excel application written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). (It is not commonly known that many Visual Basic features are not supported in VBA, including the ones I required for my output.) After some research, I concluded that adding an RTF writer to my application would produce a quality product with limited additional programming.Microsoft's RTF Specification version 1.9 is NOT the place to learn RTF. It is very complete, but anything but a text book. Sean M Burke's writings brought me from the stage of RTF novice to an adequate programmer of complicated financial tables in short order. Thank you, Sean.Robert J Lambird"
2,Actually an intro to RTF - and with mistakes,"I was really looking forward to this book as I have been fighting the rtf spec for over a year.First off, this is not a reference like the other Pocket References from O'Reilly. It is a basic intro to rtf (and in all fairness it does say that in the begining of the book).But even as in intro, it covers very little. For example, nothing about lists (ie bulleted or numbered paragraphs). So it's very very basic.Second, it's wrong in places. The biggest mistake I saw was that it says you cannot embed jpeg or png files in a rtf file. You can and it's well documented in the Microsoft spec.In short, if you know nothing about rtf, this is an ok start. But that's about it.- daveThe author has asked me to add the following - which I do agree with: ""The biggest mistake I saw is that it missed a simple way to embed jpg's and png's in documents, and instead suggested complicated workarounds."""
3,Cops (for the die-hard fans),"I've been a fan of Cops for awhile so I decided to buy this 3 box set.It contains some hilarious and dangerous scenes from aspects of a day in the life of an american cop. Its always interesting to get an inside view from the other side of the law.The only downfall is its far too short, only about 20-30 minutes each disc, I was expecting more for the price, but for fans its a good purchase."
3,Mediocre,"I am quite the avid Cops fan, so I absolutely needed this set regardless of what other reviews for this product said. I was pretty disappointed because I have seen most of these calls, and they aren't too exciting. Moreover, they're mostly old, I mean really old. If your a huge Cops fan like me, go ahead get it, just because it's the only Cops DVDs available, but if you watch the show from time to time and it's not a must, then don't waste your money."
2,It is OK if you like OLD SCHOOL Cops,"I, like many of you, are an avid fan of the show COPS. However this set does not live up to the ""Cops"" standards in my opinion. It is full of very old episodes and can be kind of misleading from the packaging. If you like the old vintage episodes you can catch on countless channels re-airing themselves get this set! If not, you will not like it and waste your money!"
2,Absolutely Disappointing!!!,This was a waste of $26 plus shipping. The reasons are explained very well in the previous reviews. It may be a great buy in Europe where cops doesn't air but here in the US I could have just watched the late night reruns on FX and saved my money.
4,Left for more,I was happy that these dvds were made available for the public to purchase. I am upset that the dvds were so short. I am still excited to say that I own this collection. It was everything that I expected.
3,happy with purchase,cops is the best show on tv and now I have some on dvd with no commercials and some extra stuff not seen on tv.
3,Mat,"Dog walks right on it with little apparent discomfort---however, she won't jump and down on it. Used in front of a door it helps a bit with the leaping against the door and landing back down on the mat. I'm talking Jack Russell here."
3,"Pretty good, but still not 100%","We have large seat cushions so these don't exactly cover the whole seat, plus one side of the couch is a chaise lounge and the mat doesn't even come close to filling up that section. The cat doesn't lay directly on the mats, but lays inbetween and next to them. And he will happliy walk right on top of them to get to a nice cushy lap. Maybe I should have measured better, but I am sure the mats with the cutouts would not have worked at all. At least they do deter the dog pretty well."
1,Caution: There's a good chance this won't work,"I bought this to keep my cat from scratching at our bedroom door in the morning. I am not stating that this is a bad product. It simply did not work with our cat. She had absolutely no problem or apparent discomfort from standing, sitting, or laying on it. I tossed it in the trash after day one.Feel free to buy and try this product, but recognize that not everyone experiences success."
4,efficient,No one wants to go near these painful seat covers. My dogs growl at them if I pick them up to move them! Just make sure you remove them before guests come over ~ unless you don't want them to stay.
