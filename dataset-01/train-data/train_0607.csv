5,The Kills is a good read (listen),First time read for me for this author. A very good read (listen) and I will be looking for more from this author in the future.
2,Not Fairstein's Best,"Alexandra Cooper is back again in Linda Fairstein's ""The Kills."" Alex is prosecuting a man with connections to the CIA for rape. Andrew Tripping, the suspect in the case, used his 10 year old son as leverage against his victim. At the same time, Mike Chapman is investigating a murder case that seems to be suspiciously linked to Alex's rape case. Alex, Mike, and Mercer Wallace must untangle the deadly web before the murderer strikes again.Fairstein is generally an entertaining read, however this novel seemed a bit formulaic. I understand that there is a fomula that lies beneath the surface of every mystery novel, but if I can grasp the formula and feel it working, then the author isn't doing their proper job. That is why I stopped reading Patricia Cornwell; the formula was in my face, and I am feeling the same thing with Fairstein. Overall, it was an OK novel. Nothing to write home about though."
3,An OK read but could have been better,"This book is one of those where the relationships amongst the book series characters make the book worth the read, but the story is a little flat. I love the symbiotic relationships of Alexandra Cooper, Mercer Wallace, and Mike Chapman (kind of like James Patterson's Women's Murder Club series), but I can't help suspect that this story is bent around a need to write about New Jersey's infamous shoreline area called ""The Kills"" and that need drove the story vs. the story being driven by probable characters. The tour of New York and surrounding environs here is terrific, but I didn't really buy the plot line that involves a famous Double Eagle gold coin smuggled from Egypt and a secondary and connected story about probable child abuse. There are WAY too many coincidences here and I tired of bouncing between storylines as the book unfolded. Linda Fairstein is a good author and I've read better from her (""The Bone Vault"" comes to mind)."
1,Boring! Skip it! Read Jeffrey Deaver instead!!!,"I bought this book because Jeffrey Deaver wrote a recommendation on the inside jacket. What was he thinking...or more likely, what was he paid?! This book is nothing like his novels. It's tedious, over-written drivel, with way too much time spent on absolutely nothing!To be honest, I can't even critique the ending since I've stopped reading the thing after chapter 8.Yes, I've wasted 20 bucks, but I'm pretty sure I can sell it to the local used bookstore."
4,well...,"ok, whether you hate em or love em, you have to admit, this cd is catchy. maybe not the good kind of catchy for some, but it is catchy, for lack of a better word. this is basically all i have to say: i am a huge fan of pop punk. it is my all time favorite genre of music, and i am not afraid to admit that enema of the state (blink) and last stop suberbia (allister) are my favorite two cds ever. so, power pop and pop punk can be used interchangably, but sometimes there is a divide, thus, throwing this cd in the power pop category. essentially, if this is the future of corporate-created pop (if this is even corporate-created) i am extremely satisfied this is it. i would compare it to an RL Stine novel for the older teenage crowd- its not full of quality as other artists, but its pretty freakin entertaining. if thats what you want, go for it, if not, dont waste your money."
4,Extremely Catchy,"This cd is really awesome and it's worth the money.It's really upbeat and catchy. It's got smooth guitar sounds and average drum beats, cause the band isn't focused extremely on rock like Sugarcult or Fall Out Boy.Mix that with a kind of a-teens style beat and couple of tambourines and you've got the unique and enjoyable band that is The Click Five."
4,"Wrong Demographic for Me, but still good Power Pop","I am another one of those older guys who loves power pop. I listened to Todd Rundgren, Cheap Trick, The Cars, etc over the years. I really like Fountains of Wayne, and that first Owsley record was the absolute best! These guys seem to be aimed at a younger female demographic, which certainly isn't me, but they still do power pop right! This is great stuff, with hooks galore, great guitars and vocals, and it is well produced too.I don't care what market The Click Five are targeting. It is good power pop, and I love listening to them."
2,"Some songs catchy, but too pop-y.","Some songs on this album are catchy, not deep or thought-provoking, and all too poppy for me. A better power-pop or punk/emo pop album is the All-American Rejects's Move Along, or try Fall Out Boy."
2,"It's an ""ok"" CD","I got this CD a couple of weeks ago, and I must say, I was slightly dissappointed. The fact that he swears the first 20 seconds of the first song on the CD was a little odd. They also talk too much about sleeping around. Also, some of there songs seem a little weak. Either it doesn't have enough instuments, or enough of a beat. There are some good songs, like, ""Just the Girl"", ""I'll take my Chances"", and ""Pop Princess"", but most of the other songs are not so great. I'm not sure weither or not I regret getting this CD."
4,boy bands rock,"these guys are adorable -- and have actual talent to back up their good looks. yeah, the marketing has been pretty slick, but so what? the album is really good and they put on a great live show. i have a feeling their next album might be more rock and less pop because they definitely seem to enjoy rocking out. anyway, give it a chance -- don't let the boy band label fool you."
1,looking dumber,mtv is dumb so is fat joe and the click five theyre looking slimmer dummer ya but not better.
1,POP SUCKS,Wow! They have a song called pop princess! Listen to real music like green day and not this crap
3,Power-Pop Plus...,"The Click Five are ""New School Power Pop"" for the 00's. They sound much like early Cheap Trick or the classic Monkee's and many other power pop purveyors, but they do it all with an original style. Their debut album ""Greetings from Imrie House"" is just good clean Rock N' Roll fun. The best tracks are ""Catch Your Wave"" & ""Just The Girl"". Much of the rest of the album begins to sound the same, but the cover of Thompson Twins ""Lies"" is an ear-catcher.They have two tunes available on iTunes that are also must-haves, a cover of 'Til Tuesday's ""Voices Carry"" that you have to hear to believe, and an original novelty track called ""My Girlfriend Forgot Me At Christmas"" that can't help but put a smile on your face. Oh, and one more thing, the album comes with a band member collectible trading card. Cool."
3,So-So album of music,"""The Click Five"" is not a revolutionary band, but they do have a few decent songs on their album that are impressive. They combine boy band pop with instrumentation, and come across with a pedestrian pop album. There is nothing cutting edge on this. A few catchy singles combined with some filler and the balance is about 50-50 between the catchy singles and the filler tracks. The singles aren't bad, but it isn't in the same pop category as Michael Jackson, Prince, or Maroon 5. The singles will sound good for a bit, but then they will be forgotten. The filler is just plain average. It isn't terrible, it just doesn't have anything that leaves it to be memorable. If you are itching for a pop album with some catchy songs, this is a good purchase. Don't expect anything revolutionary or this to become a classic album, just know what it is you are getting: an album with some classic bubblegum pop to lift your spirits for a bit."
1,One word-MTV.,"This band is only popular because of MTV. I know 'cause if I ever see any ""music"" on MTV, it's either this crap or Ashlee Simpson. JUST THE GIRL IS THE CORNIEST, MOST MANUFACTURED SONG I'VE EVER HEARD. These guys clearly rely on looks, not talent, which is just the thing MTV is looking for. These homos are convincing kids that this is rock whenit's pop, and I'm sick of all these older girls who live in my neighborhood saying they've raised the bar for rock n' roll while laughing at my Pink Floyd t-shirt and saying that I need mental help because I listen to them. Say no to this crap and say no to MTV, these guys and MTV are what's wrong with America these days.out..."
2,Formula,"All of the songs sound the same. Boys are using formula that might work for 10 - 12 year old. There is nothing creative or inspiring about this music. Vocals are thin, drums are annoying. Is there the end to this crap?"
1,since when has a backstreet boys rip off been punk rock?,like the one reviewer said listen to the sex pistols if you want to hear real punk rock and stop calling this crap punk rock!AND STOP WATCHING TRL ON MTV ITS THE REASON WE DONT HAVE ANY GOOD MUSIC ANYMORE!
3,Decent,"This is not a life changing inspiring album. But- if you want something to dance on your bed in your underwear singing into a hairbrush- then it's for you. The Click Five guys are bringing back the corny boy band, and they're doing a good job of it. The best shallow teen uber-pop I've heard in quite some time."
1,Don't buy this CD...PLEASE,Forget this sucky band. Don't listen to the people who say they are good because they suck. I MEAN REALLY REALLY SUCK!! They don't have any talent and they don't know how to write good songs. The lyrics that come from this band are really bad. PLEASE LISTEN TO ME AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP PIECE OF BAND. If people would stop wasting there money on this band and stop listening to them maybe The Click Five wold stop writing music take a hint that no one likes them. They really deserve 0 stars but amazon made me give them 1 star. You can avoid this CD. Or i guess you can waste your money on them anyway..but you will regret it if you buy this CD. Hope this review was helpful. :)
4,An introduction that really,"I have been trying to read Knuth's TAOCP and realized that I simply did not have the background, so I bought his book discrete mathematics and realized I still did have the back ground. Anyway I doung this book at the library and have read and played with half of it and have to see if you want a good introduction (introduction) about the whys and hows of math and computers this is not a bad first choice"
2,Missed Opportunity,I was so looking forward to reading this novel. Margaret Millar was the wife of Ross MacDonald and has been praised by many mystery critics for the psychological motivations of her characters. In this novel the motivations made no sense. Character development was weak and the resolution was predictable way before it was revealed at the novel's end. Overall a disappointment.
4,Warm and waterproof,"For the most part, these bibs are great. They have kept me very warm and very dry in some fairly ugly weather while in a tree stand. The do a superb job stopping both wind and water and help to retain your body heat very nicely.The full length leg zippers make it easy to get in and out of them with your boots on, which is convenient.My only complaint is the shoulder straps. They seem really cheap and out of place compared to the rest of the bibs. Its sort of like they just quit trying once they got the main body done and just threw on any old straps for the shoulders. They're too thin and can bite into your shoulders. they are easy to adjust, so I'll give them that, but some decent width and padding on them would have gone a long way towards getting a fifth star.Over all I would recommend them, though. I'm going to modify mine to make the shoulders more comfortable. But if you want to stay warm and dry you could do a lot worse."
2,not enough,"hi chaps, the book it is not too bad it shows you everething about how to design, plans elevations etc... but i bought the book because I was interested in graphic symbols and the wasn't enough so I return the book.Even tough a good book for a person how is looking the get in the stage of learning the process of drawing."
4,"""Creed or Chaos""","A Christmas gift to a smart granddaughter. Dorothy Sayers makes sense, and her writings are especially important both for today and in a historical sense."
4,A Quality Read,"This short work is well worth the time of any Christian. What exactly is our claim? Has the church complacently allowed a post-modern relativism to separate us from the great doctrines of the creeds? Why is modern Christianity so diverse and perverse? These are the critical questions Sayers attempts to answer. Her uncompromising passion for objective truth is refreshing and she conveys that righteous passion with eloquence. Again, this short work is well worth the time. The only caveat I will make to my enthusiastic approval of her book is it seems to end after the fourth chapter. Chapters five through seven are dedicated to things outside the primary concern of the work, embodied in the first four chapters. While the later are of some value as well, the first four chapters are the heart of the work and they are what I enthusiastically praise."
5,From the pen that wrote life into Peter Wimsey.,"What a treat to find this book to enjoy right along with Sayers' fiction. While Sayers was not Roman Catholic, there's not a thing here a Catholic could complain about. In fact, it made clear for me some of the recent teaching of John Paul II, and this from a book written at the beginning of World War II. I read the first several chapters with great enjoyment, savoing Sayers' beautiful use of the language, and finding myself lifted in prayer. Then the last two chapters, I found myself reading with a growing conviction that I need to retool some of my thinking. Warning: this book may shock some who think capitalism is unadulteratedly Christian!"
5,Best alternative description of 9/11,"This is the best production I have seen of what happened leading up to and following 9/11/2001. It is a credible presentation, unlike Alex Jones' videos and Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. I'm not saying that these other videos are without benefit. They offer SOME truth, but the manner in which they are presented make them (and anyone who believes that stuff) appear as lunatics. It makes me wonder whose side they are on. 911: Press For Truth, on the other hand, presents things in a logical, questioning manner. It causes one to pause and think (and, of course, question the government's official version) rather than leading a person to phoney far-out conclusions. 911: Press For Truth is well worth the time to view it."
4,"A careful, low-key conspiracy theory expose","As someone who long ago abandoned belief in the ""official"" story, it seems to me that the strength of this film is its introduction of the basics of the alternative explanations of what really happened, in a manner so matter-of-fact that the average viewer will not be so quick to deny them. This, and the conventional, mainstream sources sited position this as a potential breakthrough film for the 9/11 truth movement.Anyone open-minded and interested enough to want more info should check out The Terror Timeline, written by Paul Thompson, the ""citizen journalist"" that appears in the film. Although the information in this book is certainly highly suggestive on its own merits, Mr. Thompson has taken an even-handed approach that allow individuals to draw their own conclusions."
5,Essential Viewing....,"...for those that still believe dr evil on kidney dialysis pulled-off the theatrical events of 9/11 and craftily escaped through a labyrinth of underground caves. It's all for the ""greater good"" don't you know ! Outstanding introduction for the Complacency News Network crowd that still don't see that the Western government and mainstream newsmedia has become sick...very very sick. It would have taken roughly $1-2M to stage the events of that day - compare that to the windfall of BILLIONS that landed upon Halliburton, the oil and defence industries through privatization of Iraqi NATIONAL resources and this administrations lies and obstruction of justice all make perfect sense. 9/11 was PNAC and Karl Rove's rather convenient wet dream and people are stupid - has history taught us nothing? Free yourself from ignorance and view this dvd !"
5,An Indispensable Tool for Revealing the Truth of 9/11,This movie is an excellent expose of the events surrounding Sept. 11. I recommend everyone watch it.
4,Good easy reference book,"As a newcomer to the state of Washington, this book has been very helpful in identifying the flora and fauna of the area. Combining the plants and animals in one easy reference source is helpful. The photographs are very nice."
2,Eh...,"Okay overview but not very detailed and doesn't provide the information for identifying what you come across. For birding, I like other field guides better ..."
3,"Okay, but not what I was looking for.","I like the compact size of this book and the color photographs, however it isn't very useful for identifying new plants and animals. I was hoping that my kids could use it to identify some of the trees and shrubs in our area but it is difficult to use it that way and there aren't many varieties of each species. I ended up ordering a different guide for trees and one for birds that I like much better."
3,Legendary live album doesn't quite live up to the legend,"I'd knock the rating here up a star if this was a single-disc with just the stronger tracks instead the music being spread thin over two discs. It is certainly better than the studio albums that preceded it, but not all of the songs here are winners. Disc one starts off strong with rockin' versions of Deuce and Strutter, then peters out. Disc Two is solid from beginning to end though, with a great version of Black Diamond (love that intro) and a terrific one-two punch to close it out with Rock n' Roll All Nite and Let Me Go, Rock n' Roll."
5,I Love Everything KISS HAS RECORDED!,"I own some of these albums,(only in cassette form).I am trying to rebuild my KISS Collection after loosing all my albums during a couple of moves.I would like to replace my albums on CD, because the tapes I do have are getting worn out from over-play."
4,last kiss cd for my collection,this cd came in a timely manner and was in the shape described . and it was finally nice to get the last one of their cd's i needed to complete my kiss cd collection .
4,4.5 stars...another great '70's live album,"Right before the real silliness started, ""Kiss Alive"" represented what Kiss was meant to be: a bonafide over the top '70's glam band on steriods....not the Gene Simmons pre teen marketing plan. Sadley, shortly after this came out, we started seeing the dolls, lunchboxes, kites, bedspreads, underwear, halloween costumes, toothbrushes, action figures, coffins, trading cards, really bad movies, etc. Despite some good records later in their career, Kiss was heading for a slump.What we get with ""Kiss Alive"" is straight up hard rock before a more mature crowd. Songs such as ""Duece"", ""Strutter"" ""Cold Gin"" ""Black Diamond"" & ""100,000 Years"" are improved from their studio counterparts and are refreshing to hear in a live setting, I don't care how many overdubs were done in the studio. This album is a milestone in the career annals of Kiss, and if there is one Kiss album to have above all others, this is the one."
5,one of the greatest of the live albums ever,This disk presents one of the greatest 'live' albums ever recorded. Most critics agree with this statement and it holds true to this day. This is a band at the peak of their powers on stage and sure all live albums had bands correct mistakes in the studio. The technology of the day meant live recordings often were unable to capture a show without losing something in the mix. Today we have much better equipment; but if you have ever seen kiss live then you know they are one of histories greatest live bands and they can reproduce their songs very well live. But this live disc should appeal to any rock fan even if you aren't a kiss fan because it's just a great hard rockin time. Every song is good and fun with the band playing at full board greatness. Any fan of rock and roll should at least have this disc in their collection because few live discs will every capture the pure joy of rockin out in front of a crowd as well as this one does.
3,Live almost,One heck of a live album even though it has since been revealed the band pieced the lp together and used lots of studio enhancement to get the correct sound.Not a bad bit of live fluff.
5,SIMPLY THE BEST! ARGUABLY THE BEST LIVE ALBUM IN HISTORY...,"IF I HAD TO PICK JUST 1 KISS ALBUM THIS WOULD BE THE ONE... AN INSTANT CLASSIC, THAT SHOWS THE RAW POWER OF KISS LIVE!WITH THE BANDS CAREER IN QUESTION, KISS SOLD OUT DETROIT'S COBO HALL IN MAY OF 1975, THEY HIRED PRODUCER EDDIE KRAMER AND THE REST IS KISSTORY... WITH CLASSICS LIKE, DEUCE, STRUTTER, HOTTER THAN HELL GOT TO CHOOSE, SHE, 100,000 YEARS AND ROCK N ROLL'S NATIONAL ANTHEM ROCK N ROLL ALL NITE!!! THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED IN AUGUST OF 1975 TO MODEST SALES, IT WASN'T UNTIL ROCK N ROLL ALL NITE (LIVE) WAS RELEASED AS A SINGLE THAT SALES BEGAN TO GO THROUGH THE ROOF, TO DATE KISS ALIVE! IS QUADRUPLE PLATINUM... KISS ALIVE! SAVED THE BAND AND MADE KISS ONE OF THE MOST SUCESSFUL BANDS OF ALLTIME..."
3,"A fake, but still fun","Mean Gene the Monster Machine admitted to VH1 recently that much of ""Alive!"" was actually recorded in a studio with the producer looping and amping up the roar of the crowd. So it's not really a live album, so much as a kind of concept album about the ultimate rock'n'roll concert. And what a party these goofy kabukis put on -- even if it is simulated. The songs are mostly all paper-thin stomp-alongs that sound awful in their original versions. But in this rawer setting, the bludgeoning chords and caveman choruses get in your gut and unleash the animal within. Even lyrics like, ""I'm a Capricorn and she's a Cancer!"" go down without inducing a gag. The best moment isn't ""Rock n Roll All Night,"" though. No, for true metal mania, Ace Frehley's faux-live ""Parasite"" is still Kiss' best."
3,Too Many OVERDUBBS!,"KISS ALIVE IS BASICALLY A STUDIO TREATED ""LIVE"" ALBUM. WHILE GENE SIMMONS CLAIMS THAT THE ALBUM WAS ONLY CORRECTED SLIGHTLY, FOR OBVIOUS MISTAKES, EDDIE KRAMER (THE PRODUCER) ADMITS THAT MOST OF THE ALBUM, EXCEPT FOR PETER CRISS'S DRUMS, WAS RECORDED IN THE STUDIO. THATS LAME! AND ALSO, THERE ARE MANY OTHER ARTISTS THAT KICK KISS'S A**, IN THE STUDIO AND ON STAGE! KISS IS OVERRATED AND CANT EVEN RELEASE A REAL LIVE ALBUM. (ALIVE II AND III WERE OVERDUBBED TOO!) HECK, TWO SONGS FROM ALIVE II WERENT EVEN RECORDED IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE AT ALL. THEY WERE RECORDED DURING A SOUND CHECK. CAN IT GET MUCH WORSE. THE ALBUM ITSELF CAN BE ENJOYABLE FOR THE AVERAGE KISS FAN, BUT REMEMBER IT'S NOT REALLY ""ALIVE""!"
5,KILLER LP!!!,"This LP is incredible! An exact repro of the first 1975 pressing. Every detail, for the dedicated KISS fan, is here! Classic Casablanca labels, gatefold, booklet and even the old innersleeves! And the sound...amazing!!A must buy for KISS collectors!!!"
5,You wanted the best? This is it!,"Quite simply the best KISS album. And one of the best rock albums from anyone. I never tire of Black Diamond and Rock Bottom. 30+ years later, this album rocks!"
5,ROCK N' ROLL AND KISS 'ALIVE!',"This is THE BEST live record ever to be unleashed onto the world! Even though it's now 26 years old, this one single moment in rock history captured the imaginations of millions! And it inspired so many to pick up a guitar and ROCK! I love this album more every time I hear it. It sounds fresh...and not dated at all. It's what live rock is supposed to sound like. KISS reached it's peak with this one...and it remains THE ULTIMATE KISS ALBUM. If I had to give up every album (and or CD) and keep only one...it would be KISS 'ALIVE!'"
4,Catman,"Criss could flat out play during the period when this set was recorded. After he became hooked on coke and heroin, around 1976, he completely lost his ability to play; hence, the group hiring studio drummers on several of their last recordings.He definately set the plate on this set. Without the steady 4/4 thump, this wouldn't have the ""oomph"" that it does.Simple songs and lyrics. What's wrong with that? The finest rock and roll songs are simple ones, and they're the hardest to write and make original."
4,"One of the greatest ""live"" albuns of all times !!!","THrough my experience listening and reading about KISS, I still haven't reached a final conclusion: are they a band who really cared about their fans since their start, doing always the best they can, or are they people who cares only about their fans' money? I don't know. ALIVE represents this, because it's getting clearer day by day that this albun was greatly overdubbed in studios (a thing that is not difficult to believe, due to Kiss's known interest only for money). But: studio or no, this sounds amazing, fantastic, pure rockn'roll. It is included in almost ""best-ever"" list of albuns. Get it!"
1,KISS IS LAME,"Anyone who thinks this is an awesome live album is actually kidding themselves, not to mention if you think Kiss is a good band. Alive was completely constructed in the studio, and audience noice was later pumped in, louder than it actually was at a real show in fact."
1,kiss blows,"im not a kid, i just dont feel like giving info out a lot. i find it very funny that they had to add in crowds cheering, and that says something about the band. this band is as fake as they come. if it wasnt for their image do you really think they would've gotten so big? of course not.so dont waste your money unless you are a true kiss fan, and if so thats cool."
1,"All Show, No Talent","That pretty much sums up KISS.This is considered their best album, i'm sorry, but that is just sad. These guys needed to put out a live album or they were gonna sink as a band because their studio albums sucked @$$, they had no technical skill with their instraments, they had to relie on face paint and pyrotechnics to draw the crowds into their shows. I like 70's hard rock alot, but KISS was nothing but a foolish show with four guys dressed up like effing retards breathing flames. With no ability to play, it was like going to a circus to see the clowns intead of a rock concert. This ""live"" album was completely overdubed as soon as the master tapes were parked in the studio parking lot, the only thing untouched was Peter Criss's drum work. They sucked so bad live that they need massive studio overdub to make this sound right. How can you call this live when nothing on here was recorded live?"
1,Nothing to Cheer About,"Kiss was one of the big bands of the late 70s, but there was one thing Kiss could never do. Put out a album that's subject matter wasn't all about getting drunk and rock n rolling all night. Most of Kiss albums contain at least three good songs and the rest of the songs are fillers. Saddly on Alive! Kiss delivers reptitive versions of their ""Klassic"" songs. Lets get this straight Kiss was not a good band, they knew how to market the product and take advantage of teen anger by creating loud repetative songs. If you like flashy, loud repetative songs buy this, if you want really good live music look right to the Who. The one star is the least I could put so I would really give it no starts, but I had to give one."
5,The Greatest Live Album Of the century,I brought this album with my brother when I was 14 and he was 13.We both played it constantly. It drove our parents nuts becausewe played it so loud.This album has the best live versionsof kiss classics around. So I highly recomend this album and bothof it's sequels[ Alive II and Alive III] to anyone who wants a really good live rock album. This album is alot better on cd.Mainly because you can't wear it out. My first copy is so wornout from constant play that the sound quality is terrible.
5,the best album by the best band ever,"when alive! came out, it had some tough competition, like made in japan, live at leeds, and get yer ya-yas out. fortunately for kiss, alive! bet out all of these and took its place in rock history as the best live album, and in my opinion, the best album of all time. good job."
4,The Only KISS You Need,"As this album clearly demonstrates, KISS's live performances infuse rather lackluster music with an energy that is lacking in their studio work. This is much more enjoyable than the studio work that came before it, though the performance of ""100,000 Years"" might mark a lot point in the history of unnecessarily long drum solos and the diatribe before ""Cold Gin"" is just ridiculously juvenile. But the music is enjoyable, overall."
2,ROCK 101,"With my discovery of this album, KISS introduced me to rock & roll. 22 years later I'm still a working drummer. I thank them for that. But I wish I still had that special feeling for KISS : I've accepted that it's only the ""nostalgic"" element that draws me to listen to them now, and even that's a pretty rare occasion. Listening to Paul Stanley talk, it's obvious that he seriously considers KISS music to be as timeless as say ... the Beatles. What a laugh. But like so many mindless religious fanatics, fans of KISS would never even consider them less than outright musical gods ... Gene $immons thanks you all !"
3,Studio magic.... Enjoy it,"I've always had a soft spot for KISS regardless of their cheeseball lyrics and less than stellar musicianship. Lets face facts, the only one with a measure of talent is Ace. That said, its' easy to get caught up in the 'music.' Rock'n'roll was never meant to be analyzed. So instead, shut your brain off and enjoy some good bubblegum."
1,"Good album, but not ""live""","The only portion of this album that is actually live is the drum track. Everything else, and I mean everything was redone in the studio after the fact. Listen to Gene singing harmonies against himself on ""She"" or Paul singing harmonies with himself on ""Hotter than Hell""...you can't do those things live. It's not possible. (At least it wasn't back then)...Eddie Kramer and Bill Aucoin have both stated that the almost the entire album was rerecorded in the studio using a audience backing track. It sounds good, but to me it's still a farce. KISS could never play that good live back in the day."
1,Is it live? Or is it a studio album?,It is both of these. If only we could hear the REAL master tapes of these performances could we then and only then really judge this as a 'live' album. This is really 1/2 live album and a 1/2 studio album. Many of the vocal tracks were re-recorded in the studio. Paul Stanley and Eddie Kramer are on record admitting and even defending these actions. Some of the bass and guitar tracks were re-recorded in the studio for this album. Much of the crowd noise was re-done for this 'live' album. What are we left with? A mirage. This album is a misrepresentation of a live album. It is dishonest and does not represent KISS live. How can it when most of what you hear was done in the studio? Don't say this is the 'greatest live album'. It is not the greatest for the simple fact that most of what you hear was not recorded at the show. This is album is a legend based on a lie. I give it 1 star because of the dishonesty and misrepresentation of what a REAL live show is.
4,"Entertaining, but...","No question about it, John Shirley can write. He can take a so so story, and turn it into soemthing quite interesting. Unfamiliar with the comic book series the story is based off of, I was a bit thrown by the strong ""magic"" elements in the book, which took a little getting used to. I was expecting a bit more action and a dramatic ending that I felt fell a little short. The book is, by far, much better than the movie. If you haven't seen the movie, read the book. If you've seen the movie and you want a better understanding of the story, read the book.All in all it was a very good read. I didn't give five stars, because that would've meant a great read."
5,Important add on to the movie,this book fills in the plot holes in the movie and helps the reader understand the complete story. the book is very well written. if you liked the movie read this book
1,Abolutely boring,"There were several good scenes, but they didn't make up for the rest of the book. Not worth reading."
2,MOVIE REVIEW: mirthless,"The movie is dressed with a over serious aura and a pretty dumb but twisty plot, and take all the visual ques from the matrix and cheesy special effects from both daredevil and blade 2 and youve got constantine. Keanu Reeves plays and approaches the same role he did in the matrix. Kind of sucks because had someone else done they wouldve added depth to the charachter instead of butchering it with woodedness. scattered throughout are scenery chewing characters. Gavin Rossdale shouldnt quit day job....on second thought maybe he should stick to acting. The lifeless plot injects little life in the chracters. So what is there left.not much except a few decent action and beo-noir-ish atmospherics. too many times you wish the movie werent so pretentious so you could possibley enjoy whats there."
3,Quick read.,"Don't read the back cover. It gives away too much of the story.Without giving away the story, Ashley Camdon substitutes for her sister as a nanny where she meets the mysterious hero, Kyle Stone. Ashley's twin, Jill Gordon is in trouble.I don't know that many identical twins, but, Jill and Ashley don't seem to have anything in common personality-wise. The hero and heroine are likeable but fairly standard characters. Most of the secondary characters are somewhat sketchy.The plot was well written and moved quickly prehaps a little too quickly to the end. The bedroom scene felt thrown in, it was about three paragraphs. This book was more about intrigue than sex.It was a quick and pleasant read."
5,Awesome,I find this book to be an awesome aid in providing appropriate prayers and scriptures. I am a Chaplain at a major hospital and it has proven to be very valuable as I minister to patients of various backgrounds.
1,"Horrible, HORRIBLE execution","This game would have been awesome if the email function worked. As it stands now, you'll have to wait upwards of a day or two to receive emails with clues vital to continuing in the game.This is complete madness, the absolute epitome of horrendous game design, especially since this email function was the only selling point of this rather dull and poorly produced game in the first place.Do yourself a favor: put away your credit card, click the back button on your browser, and search for one of the many online riddle sites that offer the same sort of arbitrary puzzles for free, without the awful acting and the crippling dependence upon an a faulty email system.Boo, Dreamcatcher. Boo."
4,Makes you think,"Ok, alot of you out there are upset because you're thinking the game doesn't work. WHile you are being frustrating, check out the games website, there are patches that need to be downloaded in order for the game to work. I enjoyed the puzzles this game had to offer. ALthough some were difficult/pointless, they nonetheless did what they were supposed to and that was kill time, and make you think. there is an excellent website out there that will help guide you in the right direction if you get lost. If you would like this website, please email me at jaraivy@yahoo"
1,***Caution**** Missing Since January,"The game was fair at best.... the problem is, when I finally completed the game and tried to uninstall it, the uninstall program deleted ALL OF MY PERSONAL DATA AND SETTINGS! I am an experienced computer user and I dont' know if it was some crazy glitch or a bad joke, but none the less, it ate half of my computer!!! USE CAUTION with this game."
1,Missing CD unreadable,The package I received from Amazon contained an installation CD that was not readable by my computer. I cannot return it since it has been opened. I cannot sell it because it doesn't work. I'm out $19. I recommend you do not make the same mistake and don't even consider purchasing it.
1,"Different, yet appalling","This game consists mainly of the following:-clicking on floating shapes(some of which are moving) for no discernable reason-trying combinations of given nouns in Google to find the pages set up by the game makers-playing truly asinine arcade games-watching movies which are seldom in the least compellingAdmittedly, this game is a form of annoyance I have not before experienced, thus I suppose it is, in some way, innovative.I should also note that there are 2 ``puzzles"" near the end which are rather hard (on the patience and hands, not the brain), which was presumably a last-ditch effort to expand game-play time. Kudos."
1,"""Missing: Since January"" Does Not Work!","Very disappointed in this game because after three installs, it still will NOT work on my six-month old computer using Windows XP. It keeps on crashing my computer and causing it to reboot. When I was able to play it for a few minutes, the puzzles made no sense and were very difficult. The instruction book that comes with the game is very poorly written and is not accurate. The instructions are unclear and don't match up with what is displayed on your computer screen. Perhaps this is due to the instructions being translated from French or something...I don't know.Very upset that I blew $20 on yet another game I cannot play on my computer.THIS GAME SUCKS!! TOO MANY FRIGGIN' BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Excellent curriculum!,"I ordered this product not knowing what to expect. This video contains 7 ""episodes"" each 18-22 minutes long. Seven students journey across the USA meeting influential Christian leaders. I have reviewed the first 3 episodes entirely. They are filmed in a ""canned"" reality show type of format, of which I am not a fan but the students seem genuine and the lessons from each episode make this DVD well worth the price you pay. Enjoy and God bless you!"
3,Bob Hope - Laughing with the Presidents,"DVD was delivered on time and in excellent condition. From a historical perspective, this would be a good addition to one's DVD library for insight to Bob Hope and his personal relationships with the many Presidents of the United States outside of official business."
4,Short but Great,"This short novella by Balzac is pretty fun. It is a great illustration of the changes in French society and those who were left behind. It also is an insightful examination of the aftermath of Napoleon, nobility, the legal system, and the economy. It is a quick read and quite enjoyable. If you feel that Balzac's other works are unapproachable, I would suggest starting here and diving right in."
5,IF YOU LOVE FIBER ARTS,"I discovered this book at the library, renewed it several times, and then decided I just had to have it. I love fiber arts. The work from the countries of Asia stupefies the mind with its intricacy, delicacy, and sheer beauty. The book explains the meanings of many of the designs and weaves history with aesthetics. The author is an accomplished needle artist herself."
3,"Good, but better in picture","Found the watch to small to a man. Although it says ""unisex"", it is too small. I found the watch looks nicer in Web pictures. Nevertheless seems to be a good watch."
2,wrong color,The watch itself is very nice but it appears to be blue when you look at it online. The watch is not blue until you get it under certain light. It is actually irridescent and not as appealing as it looks online.
4,Not a unisex watch,I ordered this watch with out noticing the band says it is a womens so when I got the watch I was suprised to see the size of the face was way to small to fit on any mans wrist. The watch is a good looking watch but I gave it to my wife who loves it.
3,"aka ""The Magnificent""","Dragon Master is perhaps better known as ""The Magnificent"",already available on DVD from Crash Cinema. The maindifference is that whereas Dragon Master is the typical""full screen with english dub"", The Magnificent is widescreenand in original language (cantonese or mandarin, not sure).I already had the later, but Dragon Master was so cheap Idon't mind seeing the other version. In terms of getting theactual story, The Magnificent comes across more clearly.Also, Dragon Master is cut and the dub, while performed well,leaves out too much nuance for my tastes. When you know which parts have been cut out, the story suffers a bit.As for the movie itself it is quite watchable, if not one ofthe ""all time greats"" of martial cinema. It has a lot offamiliar faces including: Chen Sing, Carter Wong, Doris LungChun Erh, and 'Casanova' Wong. Even Dragon Lee has a cameo.The story revolves around the typical Ming vs. Ching plot -you can fill in the gaps from there.-HC"
5,Great Studies,This is definitely a must if you are wanting to conduct studies using the Faith Lessons series. Visual learning was always my favorite so this allowed me more stimuli for learning.
3,A Step Into Musical Growth,"Kiss's ""Music From The Elder"" is a good album. It is also very different from what they did during the 70's when they were the supergroup of the decade. By the time the 80's came around, Kiss was a different band and like all bands do, they changed. Was it a change for the better? Probably not at the time. ""The Elder"" is Kiss's most obscure album and is looked upon as a wrong move in thier long career. But, if you are a Kiss fan, you need to buy this album. Thier are a lot of good tunes on it. I highly reccomend this album for Kiss fans only because real Kiss fans will appreciate it's diversity and originality."
3,THE ELDER,"WIth KISS in personal turmoil, (Music From) The Elder was a vision of creativity never-before explored by the band.After Peter Criss opted not to record with the band for 1980's UNMASKED (Anton Fig played drums for the record), and Eric Carr had taken over behind the kit for the Aussie '80 tour, KISS tried something new in the following studio record.Unfortunately, this record has not been recieved well by the mainstream of KISS fans. The more die-hard fans see it as a masterpiece. But even the members of KISS dislike the record.Personally, I think the record is very good. But, once again, this record shows the ongoing struggles of KISS as a unit. Ace Frehley recorded his guitar parts alone at his home studio, and Allen Shwarsburg (Simmons' Solo Album drummer) filled in on drums for the song ""I"".In the words of Paul Stanley: ""The Elder is not a bad album, it's just a bad KISS album.""I think it's a very good KISS album."
2,"The burrito's getting bloated, boys...","Like many, I was discouraged upon hearing this album when it first came out. However, with time, some of these songs have grown on me (""I"" being one example). ""The Elder"" was a definite dud in terms of the complex concept album it tried to be, but I actually don't fault Kiss for trying to evolve somewhat, back when concept albums and Bob Ezrin were trendy entities in the music biz. Who knows, maybe the boyz will be back someday with ""The Elder, Part II."" With all of their grown experience, I think they could do it...Hey, this isn't ""The Wall,"" but few albums are!!"
3,Eric Carr Deduts,"This album marks the debut of 80s era KISS drummer Eric Carr. It is a concept album with World Without Heroes easily being the best track. It was the first KISS album to not go gold. They had originally set out to make a Destroyer- type album, but went for this instead."
2,bomb!,"Kiss puts forth a great musical effort on this one, especially Eric Carr and Ace Frehley, who plays some of his best solos despite is unhappiness with the band's direction at the time.The lyrics and the story are confusing and seem incomplete. There aren't any real hooks or sing-along type songs here. Kiss fans like it because we're Kiss fans!If you're willing to give it a few fair listens, it's actually a bit intriguing. The sound of the hottest band in the world completely alienating their audience! The best tracks are Ace's 'Dark Light' and Gene's 'A World Without Heros.'If you're new to Kiss, go for the ALIVE! albums, 1-4. If you don't like Kiss, then why the hell are you reading album reviews?"
1,What can I say?,"First of all, I love KISS. I own this album and always will, simply because it's a KISS record. The truth is....this blows big time. It's not useful for anything other then completing collections. This is the worst idea Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley EVER had. Ace and Eric wanted to do a heavy metal album to make up for the ""Unmasked"" disaster. Good ole Gene and Paul said ""nope"", ""were doing a concept album!"" The songs don't make any sense and don't connect. The concept seems very similer to the ""Zelda"" nintendo games. When this record bombed, Gene and Paul knew they had blown it again. This is the only KISS record that didn't at least go gold. They decided to do a good metal album and returned with ""Creatures of the Night"" in '82. By then, the fans were gone, and a good album went ignored. KISS would have to remove their trademark makeup to get their fans to pay attention in the 80's."
2,OMG THIS IS LIKE A LOST GEM OR AN UDERRATED ALBUM!!!,Says the KISS fan-boys now don't get me wrong i am a huge KISS fan i own all 3 of the KISSology DVDs and almost almost all their albums but i can never get myself to say i actually like this album. some of the songs on here are just crap and actually gave me a laugh when i heard them such as Just a Boy Mister Blackwell and I. But some songs are actually ALMOST passable as KISS songs and they are:A World Without Heroes (though the unplugged version is better)Dark LightEscape From The Islandand the Oathso bottom line dont buy this unless u are a hardcore KISS fan if not then check out their 70's stuff (as long as its not dynasty) and see if you like that
5,best kiss album?,"just heard this album for the first time since i had on vinyl when i was 10 years old. needless to say my musical tastes have vastly changed in the 30 years or so since then.i listen to everything from black sabbath to pink floyd,miles davis,rush,slayer....you name it and yes i still love kiss.the old kiss anyway(with makeup).i cant say this is my favorite kiss album but it is a great album.a total departure from anything they had ever done but it still sounds like kiss.nearly every song is good and a couple are great(the oath).if this album had been released byanother band like rush or pink floyd or someone like that known for concept albums it would have gotten much better reviews.give it a chance, put it in and listen to it for what it is."
3,Not Bad,For all the downplaying of this album it actually isn't that bad.There are a few highlights here such as The Oath and I which has all the anthem appeal of Shout It Out Loud.A World Without Heroes is actually one of the best songs Kiss ever released and Escape from the Island is a nice lil rare insturmental gem.One feels if Ace Frehley and Eric Carr were allowed to have a little more of a presence on the album I feel this would have been a cool record.Another negative was a terrible drum sound which even Eric Carr and Ace said they hated.
3,A good album..! Just not a good KISS album...,"OK, I'll admit it. I like this record. It's got some great material on it. Escape from The Island, for example, is an instrumental masterpiece. However, this should have had another band's name on it. KISS has tried to broaden themselves in the past, and that can be a good thing, but it wasn't this time. The album opens with flutes, and then into a quiet ballad. Not what KISS fans expect when the last album that Bob Ezrin produced for KISS was 'Detroyer' (an absolute masterpiece). At least Bob redeemed himself 10 years later with 'Revenge'. In short, if you get this album, keep an open mind. It's not what you'd expect from 'The Hottest Band in The World', but it's still worth a listen."
1,Oh come on,What a dull and extremely boring album YAWN.A disgrace of a album and quite possibly the worst by these morons.
2,"It was panned in its day, and not without cause but...","The boys went out on a limb with this one. In my opinion this was less of a KISS album and more of a producer exerting too muchinfluence...It happens. I do like a few of the tracks though you will probably never hear them again. ""I"" was good, and of course, ""A World Without Heroes"". They ventured too far from what made them great during the 80's but they figured it out and came back from the brink. This is one that is kept purely for historical record by the hardcore fan."
2,bad for a KISS album...but not horrible.,"KISS and a concept album? The two just do not mix in my mind. The band was in such disarray and had no idea what it's identity was after Dynasty and Unmasked.Musically speaking, this album is very good. However, KISS fans missed the pure power of the songs and the diversion into this artsy-rock just doesn't work. Apparently, KISS felt the same way as they got back to their roots with Creatures."
5,i'm cool and i like this reocrd album...,"alot of my friends tell me ""hey buddy, you're cool."" i like the elder record. so that must mean that it is good... right? sure, there are no ""all the way""s on this reocord or any ""torpedo girl""s either but i remember sitting im my basement listening to this record and playing atari until my fingers bled. i love kiss and i love the elder. (even that cooky ""he's got a light in his eyes, and the look of a champion... a real champion"" thing.)"
3,Can I rank it a 5 and a 1 at the same time?,"I do have to admit I am one of the KISS fans that loves this album. At the same time I am not going to crank it up in the car and cruise around town. This is an album for the intellectually enlightened KISS fan. I'm not saying you are stupid for not liking this, but I am saying you are challenged musically. If this was done by Pink Floyd it would have been called a masterpiece, but people just did not expect this from KISS. It didn't have a Detroit Rock City, or Love Gun on it so it was passed over as a bomb. This was based on poetry by Gene and was to be made into a movie. I am glad they did not proceed for the fact I didn't want to have to endure another Phantom of the Park. But the music is quit enchanting. The Odyssey and I, World Without Heroes, and Mr Blackwell really wear on you to become a KISS Klassic album."
3,A turning point captured on tape,"This album is a love or hate album. There is really no common ground to say its an ok album. I gave it 3 stars due to the fact that is purpose as a conceptual album is lost. The debut of fox man..eric carr is a plus.. he brought a solid backbone to kiss music that was lacking in the peter criss era..( with exception to the alive and destroyer albums).Highlights are ""the oath"" and the killer track "" I "". the song ""world without heroes"" had commercial success and i kinda took a liking to it until kiss appeared on the television show ""solid gold"" to perform or should i say lip sync this song. This album is a must have for kiss fans like myself but it isnt a keeper for the fan that lies the popular material"
3,Excellent Sounding Album,"This album was made to show KISS's fans and the critics to see how smart they were and to take the audience to a place they have never been. Even though the album didn't even make GOLD status to me this album has good tunes. The album is a mix of pop, opera, rock, heavy metal and pop. There are masterpieces on the album like ""Just A Boy"", ""Under The Rose"", ""Dark Light"", ""A World Without Heroes"", ""Mr. Blackwell"", ""The Oath"", ""Escape From the Island"" and my favorite ""I"". You buy the album and you will be happy."
4,A Great Concept Album,"While this album has gotten mixed review from the public, this album is solid. ""I"" is the ultimate motivation song, ""The Oath"" has a terrific riff to it, ""Under the Rose"" is a powerful song, and ""Dark Light"" proved to me that Kiss should actually allow Ace Frehley to add more material in their albums. What ruined the album was ""Odyssey"", which was not really a Kiss song. More like a Styx song. Otherwise, this album is really good and very motivating. One of my first albums, it holds a special place in my heart."
3,Better than Destroyer by a long shot,"The Elder the first with eric carr is actually a very listenable record if you have a open mind like me. Most Controversial record by far. This album features choirs,strings,chants,you name it its here. Kind of sounds like a rock opera. A concept album based on a orphen boy. 3 1/2 stars Worth a listen but listen with a open mind.Fave The Oath"
3,Ok album but not for KISS,"The only songs I like are:The OathWorld without Heroes and,I""I"" being the best one. I'd put that on a geatest hit list also."
2,Conceptual Caa Caa,"Kiss' attempt at a concept album backfired like an old DeSoto. It was the worst thing they could have come up with at a time when their fans had just been gagged to death with the garbage they had previously released called ""Unmasked"". From this point on it is hard to tell what Kiss was thinking. I know that if they had REALLY been thinking, Neither UNMASKED or THE ELDER would ever have been released at all. I will say one thing, it is surprising that they survived these two recordings. They were like a gun shot to the gut then a bullet in the head. Some folks may like this record, but then again, some folks like pain too. If you like pain, then buy this album and Unmasked too. It's about as painful as you can get without being locked in a Viet Cong prison camp with a swarm of rabid water rats."
4,A worthy concept,"Part of the reason this album did not do well in 1981 was the time period of the material released. New wave rock had started to become popular and Music From the Elder was, at the time, at the other end of the musical spectrum; however, listen to it today and it will surprise you how well it can hold it's own. The exact same thing happened with Creatures of the Night. Give them both a try."
1,Everyone's Different,"I personally think this is a terrible album that should never have been made. No wonder Ace left. If you are looking for KISS music, THIS IS NOT IT!!!"
1,corny church music,i don't understand why people are being nice about this album when they know very well this album sucks i checked it out to see what it was cause i liked the artwork but just listening to it made me feel as im listening to corny church music i usually don't put down an album cause theres always something i like about it theres always songs that i like on the albums of kiss but i just cant find anything i like about this one sorry but the elder album of kiss sucks i DO NOT recommend getting this kiss church music.
2,embarrassing,"ok, folks. kiss is a good time, big, dumb rock band. i think their first 6 or 7 albums are great, but why suddenly get all (cornily) inspired and pretentious?!?! the answer is BOB EZRIN. yes, he produced destroyer, which is great, but he also had JUST co-produced the wall... one of THE commercial breakthroughs of all time. so kiss sees $$$$. we all know that money drives gene at the very least, and likely paul too, so this was probably a (failed) attempt at cashing in with the concept idea popularized very recently (at the time) by pink floyd. it's hard to write a coherent concept when you're used to writing about chicks and partying (even though you don't party), so... THEY FAILED. this effort made ace sick enough to bail on the whole situation and i don't blame him. this album is a syrupy, pretentious mess. rock and roll all night and party ev-er-y day my ass..."
2,Totally worth every penny of the .59 I paid for it....,"Not being a hard-core KISS fan, but more of an 'appreciator' of their earlier work, I was drawn to buy this album primarily after reading Ace's autobio. It truly is the odd man out from the usual KISS album, and to paraphrase Ace, 'it isn't really a horrible album, it just isn't a KISS album'. Strange days indeed..."
3,Interesting,I bought this album from a bargain bin long after I had grown out of Kiss. The cover was very unusual for them - it looks a lot like the cover for Icehouse's debut album. But the music within was even more unusual. I recommend this album for people who can appreciate 'failed' concepts by major artists. You listen with your mouth open wondering what in the hell were they thinking ? Delicious.
3,"A Few Cool Songs,but that it","This album is not liked by many kiss fans,but some of the songs on this album actually rock. ""The Oath"",""Only You"",""Mr.Blackwell"",and ""I"" are all rockers,but songs like ""Under the Rose"",""Dark Light"",and ""Odyssey"" are sorry and should have never been recorded. The ultimate worst song is ""Just a boy"",which is maybe the worst song kiss ever recorded"
5,the elder,"THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT SIDE OF KISS, BUT STILL VERY COOL . I ENJOYED IT,AND KEEP ON ENJOYING IT."
1,not bad,"yeah, not bad i guess apart from the tango thing. for those of you who're interested you can find por una cabeza on the soundtrack to ""scent of a woman"" which contains a lot of other good stuff"
3,"""Hooker"" music the best","The song playing when Jamie Lee Curtis enters the hotel room is indeed by Sade: ""I Never Thought I'd See the Day"" off Sade's ""Stronger Than Pride"" album. That song along with John Hiatt's ""Alone in the Dark"" is what drew me to the soundtrack in the first place. I don't like the practice of adding or deleting songs from the original score, and the added songs on this soundtrack certainly don't seem in keeping with the rest of the tracks, so this soundtrack gets only a 3-star ""fair"" from me."
1,No Tango!,"I really appreciate another fan's review pointing out that The Tango is not (inexplicably) included on this CD. Hope is at hand, however -- search for ""Por Una Cabeza"" (song title) on Amazon to find this particular tango. The closest one I found was on the CD titled ""The Tango Project"". Beware of different versions -- orchestration, pace, etc. -- this was the closest I found to the movie version. Was very pleased with Amazon's search; only caught ""Por Uno"" as the movies credits flashed by, but was able to search out a number of CD's with this song on them, listen to samples of various styles, and learn a little bit about tango musica ... really astonishing, however, that they did not put that song on the movie CD! Not to worry, however ... Amazon's search can find that song, and possibly open a whole new world of music-you-like."
2,Missing the most important part!,"""Por Una Cabeza"", that sexy tango, has never been done better than in ""True Lies"" -- but it's not listed on the CD!"
1,"If you're looking for THE TANGO music, it's not here","That's right folks. One of the greatest tangos in modern cinema history was shown in the film ""True Lies."" I, being a big fan of the movie, thought it would be reasonable to assume that the Original Soundtrack of the Movie would contain the music to the great tango scene. WRONG! So, ladies and gentlemen, if you are one of the people who would buy the True Lies Original Soundtrack CD just to hear THE TANGO, recreating the scene mentally while listening to your stereo or working on your computer, you will be disappointed. As to the rest of the CD, I suppose it is OK. My recommendation: If you really liked the movie, and the soundtrack, even without the tango scene, then borrow the CD from me. As it stands, I've wasted 12 bucks."
3,Lumber Jack Stories,"This was a great little book packed with history of the lumber business in America. The content was easy to read and educational. The stories of hardship and true grit of the early pioneers of New England was very entertaining. A good read for those interested the outdoors, early America and the lumber industry."
4,fun read,"I got this book because I'm a fan of the Ax Men show and wanted to read a bit more about the industry. This book covers the early industry and workers and is filled with a lot of great stories. It doesn't seem like it would be a fun topic or history, but Mr. Pike's writing style is lively and the characters that logged the New England woods are even livelier. I was pleasantly surprised and would definitely recommend the book."
3,Nice Anklet..but,I bought this anklet with crystal hearts. It is lovely but after wearing it a few times the stones are all starting to fall out. It is disappointing.
3,Cute,"I'll admit, this anklet's kinda cute, but I don't like all the strass. Plus 60 bucks isn't cheap. I suppose you're paying the Hilton name..."
2,Mildly Underwhelming,"Perhaps it is my fault, but I ordered this book with high expectations because it contains the art of Mitch Byrd. However the book was very thin and unorganized. There isn't much text, so don't expect any interview type dialogue or commentary on each sketch. Also there are storyboard/sequential art pieces, but they are crammed so tightly together that you cannot enjoy their quality. For instance you would think 1 page-worth of sequential art would be printed on 1 page, however the publishers crammed 4 pages-worth of sequential art onto 1 page! These are just a few of the problems.If you are a fan of Mitch Byrd, it's a decent buy if you purchase a used copy. His art is priceless. However if you're looking for a quality collection of Mitch's work, I suggest his heftier books ""Mitch Byrd's Notes to Draw From, Vol. 1: Comic Book Illustration"" and ""Mitch Byrd's Notes to Draw From 2: Comic Book Illustration"""
5,The art of Mitch Byrd,"Its Mitch Byrd artwork... Need I say more?If so, let me say the man is a master at storytelling and hisfluid style of detailed art is not matched by most working in the comic industry today.well worth the price."
4,A Model Of Simplicity,"THE BALLROOM DANCE PACK is a model of simplicity. Walter Laird presents basic instruction in the Waltz, Quickstep, Tango, Cha-Cha, Samba and Rumba. He starts each lesson with a demonstration of a solo exercise and pictures of the appropriate close hold. The emphasis throughout the book is on the basics.Laird teaches the British style with the man leading with his right foot. Americans consequently will have to reverse the process. I find this requirement to be only a minor inconvenience. If you are seeking the bare fundamentals, this manual is a good place to find them."
4,A tale of a heram...,"With a useless boy missing the dozen of hints throw in his face on an almost hourly basis. A reset button is used at the end that makes this tale a forgetful as the many being made in Japan on a yearly basis. But since this was the last DvD, I obviously bought them all and I did like how some of the stories panned out within. So if you're into ""harem"" styled stories, I recommend this one reluctately."
3,Confusing ending,The end of Yumeria is slightly confising and I personally found it a bit hard to follow. Otherwise it was a great series.
5,absolutley killer!,i just got back from seeing them and i bought the cd at the show(which i never do!)so great! so perfectly rocking!boston rock rules!
5,"Excellent, Eye-Opening Read!","Since this book was recommended by Amazon to accompany ""Unfit for Command,"" I read it as well. While I find credibility in ""Unfit for Command,"" this title gives a much broader scope and support base for the argument that modern Democrats are extremely soft on defense. It describes Kerry's shortcomings, but it also goes all the way back to blunders of Kennedy and Johnson. This volume is well-documented, and Patterson does a fine job of presenting his case.If you'd like a perspective on political, foreign policy leadership that the media won't give you, read this book."
1,Shameless,"The best way to undercut our military is to send them to Iraq in unarmored humvees and with not enough troops. The best way to endanger soldiers is sending them to war with no plan and for no good reason. The best way to jeopardize security is by breeding jihadists with an imperialistic war based on lies. To my eyes, it's the current administration of Republicans that showed reckless disregard."
1,He is half right.,"So called liberals are to blame. So is every President and Congress since at least 1953.""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.""Make Peace!"
1,Reckless Propaganda,"This book epitomizes the danger that threatens democracy in this beloved country. Filled with lies, fauly generalizations, and just plain party propaganda, it's totalitarianistic and imperialistic agenda will frighten any educated American. It's research is based on largely archaic conservative views and the author twists facts and/or takes them out of context so much that it would make even Michael Moore blush. It's a good book to bring to the office to ridicule, though, as it's interesting how afraid of liberals Patterson is. I give it one star because there aren't too many grammar errors."
2,So everyone is wrong except Patterson? Please!,"This is just another in a series of new books wherein one side tries to discredit the other. It is another sad diatribe on America as we see it torn down and desecrated by both sides during this election. Personally, I am sick of ""revelations"" of inside secrets of either side and this type of book simply ruins our credibility and strength from inside and diseminates it to anyone in the world who wishes to believe the worst and only see the worst about America. This and books like it give hope and solace, not to mention validation, to the terrorists who want to find any reason to destroy us here at home."
5,It is about time!,"I will make this review very short... It is about time that SOMEONE pulls the wool off our collective eyes, and exposes the liberals for who they really are! You should purchase this book."
5,"This Is For ""American Patriot"" in ""Middle America""","Pres Bush has never admitted to such. Patterson has written a well researched and documented thesis. He has the background to be taken quite seriously and writes from the heart. And most of my squadron mates agree completely. Have you read ""Unfit for Command?"" Have you read this book or are you just looking to vent. Do you read anything other than Moore, Chomsky or Ivins? Didn't think so. You are the disgrace. Your party is playing politics with my men. Your candidate is drowning in his cesspool of misrepresentations and blind ambition. Kerry lied and Vietnam vets died. We are proud to serve and Iraq is not a mistake. Quit smoking the hooka pipe long enough to wake up and smell the truth. Your military is fighting a just and worthy fight...and Col Patterson tells our story well."
5,Robert Patterson is a Great writer.,"Patterson has such a great way with his writing. I loved this book. I was also fascinated by his earlier White House tell-all, 'Dereliction of Duty'.""Buzz"", if you're reading this, I think you should consider writing a novel."
1,So much trash.,"I was scanning the book when I got to page 154. Patterson writes, ""Kerry pledges to abandon the War on Terror, open a dialogue with terrorist regimes, and apologize for the mistakes of the Bush administration."" That is a lie! Kerry never said he planned to do that. That was enough to send the book into the trash."
2,interesting perspective,"For the lay person, this is an interesting view point to read and perhaps get a sense of the frustration that is felt by my people with learning disabilities. However, as some who is dyslexic and also a teacher, there are significant things missing from McCabe's perspective. While I certainly understand his anger at educational ""experts"" he seems to operate under the assumption that he is the only one who has ever experienced his circumstances or has ever thought of the things he's promoting, which is an incorrect portrayl of the history of LD education. I was entertained at times, offended at others. Overall, there are more relavent books out there."
5,Excellent music-making.,"These are classic performances. The Third is the finer one, such is the irresistible flow and grace of Walter's direction that the whole symphony here sounds like a complete single movement. Marvellous. However, do not let this CD be the only representation of Brahms' 2nd and 3rd in your collection. Its single flaw is the dated sound: it is thin and papery, and the strings have an awful vinegary edge."
4,Your average plastic BB,"I bought this along with a BB pistol, and they work alright. Don't expect anything magical with these: they are just your basic 6mm .12g BBs in a container. The gun works just fine with them, but they aren't that accurate. I tried .2g BBs and those work much better. Also, a couple of mine (ok, like 15 of them) were almost crushed or deflated(?) when I opened the container up. But, 15 out of 5000 isn't too bad. However, I bought this for $5, so I'll let it slide this one time."
5,GREAT VALUE AND WILD COLOR!,"This ammo is from Crosman, the big daddy of airsoft.This ammo shoots without jamming, but is lightweight so is affected by winds outdoors. Especially great for indoor shooting with a target (recommend the Crosman ""gel"" target).Also recommend you buy a small bottle of ammo for the dispenser bottle, with the tilted funnel spout and screw-on cap.A whole lotta fun in one jar."
3,Very good for spring loaded pistols,"Bought these a while ago before moving into the world of higher end AEGs with metal gearboxes and 410+ fps... and these are great for the pistols we have with up to mid-200 fps. Our JG AK actually came with a list of BBs that JG said would void the gun's warranty, and these were on that list, so we use them in our pistols and lesser fps airsoft rifles and use others for the heavy gear."
1,Get ready for a broken gun,"These have a seem and when ran though a gun, brake in half.They then break parts. Always buy .20"
5,Excellent and Realistic Read!,"This is an outstanding read for parents, counselors, and even students. As a college counselor I've come across many books that suggest if you do this, you'll get into here, which we all know is very unlikely. Admissions Matters 2nd edition is realistic, and full of useful information about the admissions process. This is a great read for the students who are just beginning to plan their future and may not know where to start. It's a great read for students who have their list of colleges and now need to learn more about what is needed to apply to those specific schools and so forth. This book covers topics such as standardized testing, putting together your college list, interviews, college visits, early decision and so forth. This book is realistic, a quick read, and helpful to any family who is starting the college guidance process."
4,Not for the average student,"I did find some good information in this book. It is obviously more geared to those outstanding students that are applying to the top tier universities. My daughter is looking for more of a good fit for an above average student. This book has some useful information, but didnt really hit the mark."
5,College Book,"This book is an excellent resource for both the parents of children looking at colleges, as well as students themselves. It points out some very interesting and helpful bits of advice. It is easy to read and understand and I would recommend it."
3,Pretty good.,"I would've given this a 3.5.I bought this thinking that it would reveal what I needEd to know about getting into College, but the book itself was pretty basic, the topics are given little examples, only lines of narration which might be boring to some(me), for example, there was not even one example of a letter of recommendation, personal statement or how to fill up the common application. So it has good but basic information.Although a great number of chapters like the Early decision/actions and Applying Well were pretty helpful, I wouldn't say this is the best admissions book but it is quite a good read as it has tons of advice."
5,Admission Matters,This book is clearly written and an excellent guide for the high school student and parents.
5,A SWEET SHOW,WHAT COULD BE BETTER WITH A BIG BROTHER SHOWING LOVE FOR HIS SISTER.GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES THIS SHOW
5,LOVED IT...,Myself and my 2 and 4 yr old boy and girl are big Charlie and Lola fans and this video was well worth the purchase. It even starts over at the beginning when the DVD was finished. We love it!
2,Thin and unsatisfying,"I've used Ultramet Original for many years and am very satisfied with it. I ordered the Low Carb version by accident and, instead of returning it immediately, I decided to try it. BIG MISTAKE. It's thin, unappealing, and doesn't satisfy my appetite after a workout. I don't recommend it for people who want the same effect that the original formula has."
4,A Touching read,"I'm a huge fan of Mr. McNair. I have read and own all of his novels to date including this one. It was a good read. Very touching and moving. It touches on every day life issues...reality if you will. I had a hard time putting it down once I started. I will continue to read future works from him. If you want to read something that deeply touches into your inner ""faith"", I definately recommend this book."
2,No fun for Mom,"This line of puzzles is cool to see the ""inside"" of the picture underneath the finished puzzle. However, this carboard puzzle doesn't have any jigsaws so the pieces don't lock together. My sons got four of these puzzles for Christmas and the pieces are everywhere. The pieces are just wedged in together so when one piece isn't in properly, the whole thing falls apart. Frustrating to kids, annoying to those of us trying to clean up after them."
4,Better than Lennie?,"I've travelled the world to see Lennie in concert from Manchester in 1974 to Montreal in 2008 ... and no-one interprets his songs as well as Lennie himself .. not Judy Collins, not Jeff Buckley, not Jennifer Warnes, not Rufus Wainwright, not Sharon Robinson, not the Webb Sisters. I stand corrected ... Perla Batalla's version of Nancy is arguably the finest ever. In fact, her versions of all of Lennie's magical lyrics on this CD are some of the finest ever. The CD is simply magnificent."
4,Very Good,"I am really pleased with this DVD, I bought it because of Alfredo Kraus, but I think that the baritone Nicolai Ghiaurov is the Star in this Opera he is so amazing, the sound of the DVD is acceptable, the video is kind a dark but we gotta understand that is kind a old the recording. Overall I think that is a very good."
1,Faust,"The Faust I bought was a total surprise. A quarter of the screen was taken by Subtitles written in WHITE and JAPANESESince I was presenting it as a gift, it was a total embarassement and I doubt if I'll ever buy anything from Amazone anymore.Sincerely,Mrs. Francoise E.Gilbert"
1,Faust with Chiarov and Kraus,"This opera, Faust, is a very poor performance without proper choreography and direction. I found this performance quite disorganized. The filming must have been executed by people who normally wear glasses but left them at home, because most of the filming was out of focus.The subtitles that originally were in Japanese were over-scripted in English.Both my copies have been returned as being unsatisfactory"
2,Pretty but short lived,"For the year it stayed on, I loved it. Then the heart came unscrewed and it fell off without me even knowing. I wouldn't buy another product of Paris's because jewelry should last longer than a year when properly taken care of."
5,very pretty and girly,This belly button ring and the star hoop earrings are my favourite pieces from the whole line and when they are both in stock I will definitaley be buying them.
1,Oozing rash from belly ring,I've had this belly ring for about 2 months when I noticed an oozing open rash on the side of my belly button. Turns out all the plating on the backside of the heart had worn off and it became really rough. Watch out for this if you buy! I've had my belly pierced for 4 years and this has never happened to me before now.
3,"Nice, but not best quality","I just received my belly ring a few days ago, and initially thought it was really cute and original. But already, 2 crystals have fallen out :( Like it, but wish the quality was better."
1,Crap,All the crystals fell out of this ring and the metal came off the back. Will turn your belly green!
1,"Nothing New - Don't ""updgrade""","Quicken Mac 2006 is not much of an upgrade. Compared to the 2004 version, the only change I can see is the color on some charts and some very minor changes. Quicken for PC is an excellent program. Quicken for Mac is mediocre. If you don't have any finance software and have a Mac, Quicken might still be your best bet. But don't pay for an upgrade if you have an earlier version - you'll get zero for your dollar. (I will give Quicken credit for backing their lame product with a money back guarantee ... and I will take them up on their offer.) I'd be happy to pay $99 for a Quicken Mac comparable to the PC version, but this isn't it."
1,Horrible,I have just switched from a Windows PC to a Mac. It rocks. Except that I now have no good way of keeping my finances organized. My Mac shipped with this pre-installed and I can't get along with it. I have fired up my old laptop and have reverted to MS Money 2002. I admit to being biased by familiarity but I consider it far superioer. I have accounts in the US and the UK which I cannot manage both together on Quicken. No problem on Money. The system of creating and displaying reports is also far superior and more intuitive on Money than on Quicken. This is my only negative Mac experience. I wish that there was an alternative. Back to the laptop for now.
2,Intuit - Get your act together!,"I've been using Quicken on Windows for over 10 years. I also use Quickbooks On-line and I'm an Intuit stockholder. I have loved all of Intuit's products until now. Intuit, what is the deal with this software? Buggy, hard to use?I think it's great that Intuit is shipping free versions of Quicken on the new Macs. It's a great opportunity to put a stick in Microsoft's eye. But they're squandering this opportunity with the quality of this software. I ran the conversion, and I'm going to stick with the product (I did however, evaluate several OSX-based financial software competitiors - who I won't name here) - but please, please, please Intuit put some more RnD $$$ and effort behind this software and bring it up to your usual high standards!!!!"
1,Feel Like Wasting Some Time?,"I have used Quicken since '92 or '93, and still prefer the polish of intuit to the alternatives available. I tried to ""upgrade"" to this product from Q2004, after ""revision 3"" became available (the initial release was full of bugs). Unfortunately it still will not reliably run on my G5/X.4.2 - It requires a restart of the system, after which it will start only about a third of the time. On closing, it will not backup files and reliably will hang if I try to use it again without rebooting the system. After spending 6 hours working on this, I am forced to go back to a backup copy and Q2004. I think now I'll wait until Q2007."
1,Goodbye 60 bucks,"Worthless! Every tool in Quicken is available free on the net (retirement calculators, household expense trackers...) I got it for stock portfolio management, and it fails badly there too. Getting a large, old account up to date is a multi-hour root canal followed by the continuing necessity to manually update from the brokers downloaded transaction history. Not bad you say? What if you have a bunch of stocks that pay dividends..then keeping the cash balance current is a tedious chore. I don't see a single thing this program does well."
2,"""Quit"" bug in Macintosh 2006 and 2007","With the release of Macintosh 2006, a bug appeared in the key-stroke combination for ""Quit."" Frankly, it wouldn't quit unless the menu bar was used. I reported this to Quicken, but to no avail. It was not even acknowledged, so I accepted it. It will quit sporadically, but it appears to act as it should for at least a cycle after a check register entry.Well, I assume the ""bug"" was extinguished from Quicken 2007-Macintosh, but it is not. Another user has noted this and I feel vindicated! One Quicken representative admitted that he has seen this issue.This evening a female technical representative called and made an unsupported claim that ""John"" probably did not understand my allegation despite my email archive. Once again, we went through all the gyrations, but with the same results. That ""quit"" bug still exists.I want to touch base with any Mac users with the same experience. Help would be appreciated!"
2,Phoning It In,"Several years ago, Intuit announced that they were going to discontinue Quicken for the Mac. After a personal phone call from Steve Jobs, the product was saved. Unfortunately, all development work must have still stopped at that time.Quicken for the Mac has not had a noteworthy upgrade in years. If you are recent ""switcher"" from a PC to Mac, take note that the Mac version of Quicken does not hold a candle to the PC version. They are quite different products. Quicken for the Mac looks and acts like a product from 1998.It's too bad because I love my Mac in every way. I just with *someone* made a decent personal finance software product for it."
1,Terrible,"Nearly no improvements with all the bugs intact and more. The software crashes 9 out of 10 times upon launch (until you apply the R2 patch). DO NOT upgrade!!! Stick with 2005/2004/2003. In fact, I don't see much difference between 2006 and 2003, except the money they took from me and my time lost dealing with old and new bugs.The way I see it, Intuit owe me money and an apology."
1,Didn't fix anything significant,"The Mac version of Quicken is still a poor example of Intuit's product line, and the 2006 version hasn't fixed any of the annoyances in previous versions. It is still not possible to perform basic necessities like sort your register by 'amount' or by 'payee'. 2006 still also lacks the same effervescence the Windows version has, such as forcing you to type in your online balance and the current date when you reconcile. It will allow you to input your finances, but due to lack of features (and just plain laziness), Quicken for Mac still makes it very difficult to keep track of them once you've put them in. Definitely NOT worth the price."
3,"Good, but no Foreign Currency Support",The installation and initial set-up were simple in OSX 10.4. The biggest drawback is that the Mac version of Quicken does not support foreign currencies.
2,Quicken 2006 Mac a bust,"Despite repeated attempts to install the program's updated version, using numerous tactics of my design and all the Qkn phone support could devise, it was impossible to install the updater R3 (said it could not find a registered version of Qkn 2006 Mac on the computer).if I could install it, I suspect we could do fine with it for home use as we have for years with Qkn 2003 and earlier.Any fixes to suggest?"
4,Get the R4 Updater,"I updated from Quicken 2003 -- felt it was about time. The R2 version came on CD. I was immediately sorry: all calculations slowed intolerably, and changing dates became extremely sluggish. Updated from OS 10.3.9 to 10.4 and things improved some, but nowhere near the performance of Quicken 2003. Intuit released the R3 update with no noticeable impact, but then the R4 update put things almost back to normal.If you're running OS 10.3 or earlier, I can't vouch for the R4 version's performance. I'm currently satisfied, but still feel I gace up some performance."
3,Fun soundtrack!,"It was quite a treat to hear some of these songs redone for the movie. Though most of them aren't nearly as catchy as the originals, this soundtrack is definitely worth a listen!"
1,"Movie mildly amusing- soundtrack, Atrocious!","While the movie (for my niece and nephew,) was mildly amusing, it seemed to be a rip off of ideas from the ""Tick"" cartoon series, set in a high school.The soundtrack- terrible! Why can't they leave the songs alone. I detest covers and remakes. The original artist inteneded it to be recorded the way they did. They did not intend to have some 20-something rocker wanna-bes butchering their vision. Were you really amused, or was your stomach churning, hearing these lame covers?And why would high school kids be listening to 20+ year old music anyway. My niece and nephew were complaining that they didn't know any of the songs...The only song worth listening to is the ""They Might Be Giants"" tune- finally something original on this CD!Sorry if you are offended, but it had to be said- this is still America, where I can freely state my opinions and thoughts (especially when I am invited to give it in an open forum!)"
4,Fillmore's game,"One of the best releases of the year: Fillmore Slim, alias Clarence Sims, is a multifaceted, out-of-the-sight bluesman with his own style and a terrific groove. This is contemporary electric Blues - not much of West Coast Blues here - augmented by top-notch musicians such as Joe Louis Walker, Rick Estrin, Jim Pugh and Franck Goldwasser. One regret: Fillmore, an incendiary guitar-axe, plays guitar on two tracks only."
5,better than i thought,"really, really good. Ennis knows the punisher. must read for any punisher fan."
4,book,"Good, but graphic book. Arrived in described condition and a timely manner. Very pleased. Thank you!"
5,WOW!!!!!!,"I was blown away ( no pun intended) by this graphic novel. The story line and art work are top notch. My only complaint is that it did not go on longer. I wish Garth Ennis would do an entire series of Frank Castle while he was in Viet Nam. I was completely drawn into the story and felt like I was there with his platoon searching the jungles for enemy soldiers. And talk about an awesome twist of an ending! WOW! I was blown away! This is a must buy for anyone that is a fan of Ennis, the Punisher Max series, or war stories. Buy it today. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Ennis writes another crucial story for any Punisher fan,An amazing look at how Frank Castle evolves from man to soldier of fortune during the Vietnam conflict.Worth at least two readings for anyone that enjoys war stories or especially the Punisher
1,Every box defective!,"I had to give this item one star but if there was a negative 5 star rating I would have chosen that. I received 6 boxes of lights and had already put four of them up before I lit then and discovered that only half of each net would light. I checked the two that I hadn't unraveled, and they were defective as well.A huge waste of time and a big disappointment. On top of that, it is sold by a third party so I have to deal with the hassle of returning them. Who knows if I will ever be recompensed or how long it will take.Although there are no reviews of the clear lights yet (this is the first) 2 out of 3 of the other colors have poor reviews because of this very problem. I am guessing that there will be many more negative reviews as Christmas gets closer. I am headed out to Lowes to replace them with a product that, if it doesn't work, I can replace before Easter."
5,Love it!,"No problems! The case comes shrink-wrapped and it's the newer style of case. The DVD's slide into a cardboard cover, but they're actually in a clear plastic case to keep them safe! Really nice!"
2,Wrong Disc,"One of the discs in the set was from the wrong season, but it had a label from the 4th season on it which indicates to me that it was bootlegged. They were very helpful however in refunding me including for shipping costs."
1,Awfully...*yawn*,"(Yup...it's that DC hating teen on her dad's account)Although GG is possibly one my favorite television series, I was disappointed with this one.Possibly NO character development, except maybe Lorelai.Jared Padalecki's annoyingly routine guest spots as married/in-denial/sleazball chump cheater Dean Forrester gets on my last nerve. I could smack Rory for sleeping with him, and ruining his fated marriage.Meanwhile, Lorelai becomes almost ditzy. Her relationship with Jason Stiles gets quite boring. She's totally oblivious to Luke's obvious infatuation with her.Emily and Richard's seperation is the best part...watching them bicker is funny.The end kiss with Luke/Lorelai is the best part.Otherwise...don't get it."
1,Great show but watch the disk quality,I ordered thsi new/sealed and in the season 4 box was a disk from the 5th season - how does that happen?
5,love those gilmore girls,"i have the 3 dvds of the show. i can't wait to get the fourth. this is the best show. funny,sad,inspiring,and amazing. you have to get these dvds. great quality and hours of wonderful watching."
3,OK Season,"I love the quick wit of the ""Gilmore Girls"" and the relationship between the Lorelais as well as those with the characters who populate their town. This season was like many college freshman years are--a year of transition--its clear that a lot of things are uncertain about how the show will move forward given that the cast is split up. This season has its moments so it isn't altogether disappointment but hang in there until season five, when the girls hit their stride again."
5,gilmore glory,"if you're familiar with the gilmore girls, there's no reason to read a review, but if you're not well i totally recommend this series. it's a show that started out as a way to entertain my granddaughter but after the first season i was totally hooked. after six years we still cannot wait for tuesday nights! i have all the seasons and any time i'm bored i put any disc from any season in the dvd player and i'm hooked all over again. a wonderful family show, especially for your daughters!"
3,What are they thinking??!!!?!?!,I love GG so much. It is one of the best shows and I watch the first three seasons over and over. The two main problems(there are so many little ones that I can't get into detail.): Jess is gone. He was my favorite character and him and Rory should always be together. (Hello they are together for now in real life too!) Another issue is that Rory and Lorelai aren't living in the same house so there isn't that chemistry between mother and daughter. I hate that once Luke and Lorelia START to get together I can't appreciate it because the rest of the show sucks. Another (HUGE) issue is that Rory decides to cheat with a married man. What the heck is wrong with her? She has always been the innocent girl and she now starts to become an idiot. I still love the show and I will keep on watching faithfully though hoping it will get better again.
3,"Season 4 is good, but the DVD should be better!","I was going to order this from the day is went onsale as I did with season 3 and the other before for Gilmore Girls. But this time my order is on hold until I know 100% if it's in wide screen or full screen. The details here don't list that but at other site they have said it's going to be full screen.I want wide screen. Does Amazon know what it is?So yes while the season is good, but not the best, with some interesting extras. I won't be putting in an early order this time until I know what screen format it's in and may not get it if it's not wide screen as it original air on HDTV."
5,As good as it gets!,These fast talking inhabitants of Stars Hollow are so silly and so much fun that I can never stop watching!
5,Perfect Mother/Daughter Show...,"I bought this for myself after Christmas when they went on sale, and I adore it! My mom and I are addicted to the Gilmore Girls (5pm ABC Family - people know better than to bug us, 8pm WB - people will lose a limb if they call us!). Buying the DVDs is so nice because we can watch them whenever, and they're still so good!!"
5,Gilmore Girls just gets better,"My daughter and I bought the 4th season as a ""family"" Xmas gift. Seeing these episodes again allowed us to notice more details, some good acting and the story arc. No one can tell a teen anything, but good drama/TV can communicate quite a lot..."
4,Gilmore Girls Fourth Season,I found the best prices on Amazon and everything I ordered was in excellent shape.
5,GG lover,"Bought this for my mum as she started to watch GG to help her improve her English, which is not her mother tongue and she needs English to communicate at work in her home country. This series is great because it offers all kinds of vocabulary, phrases and cultural references (the DVD pack includes a glossary with explanation of these) while all comes in an interesting, likeable, but real-life main and side stories."
5,Gilmore Girls - The Complete 4th Season,I am a Gilmore Girls junkie. I am the wrong one to ask. Anything Gilmore is good to me. Buy the entire 7 seasons! Then try to find the writers and producers and ask them why didn't they give us more!
3,Gilmore Girls,"My wife loved the series and this was a great gift to her. Great price and good shipping time. I enjoy the series too, although this season is where it started getting stupid, I think. My wife loves them all."
4,Love from across the pond.,"I am an English fan who was put onto this series by a friend. I did not know a thing about them till then, there were no Gilmore's in my life.I bought series one and waited to see if they were that good. I am now on series 5. A few people thought 4 lost strength with Rory going away, but I found it kept going beautifully, especiall the business side of it with Mr Gilmore's comings and goings and how they had a knock on effect. I love this series and will be very sad to see the last one ever, but I gather series 7 is going, so still have some more to look forward to. I am lucky to have found a little multi-regional DVD player so I can take the Gilmore's away to boring events and journeys and even dog sitting on the west coat of Ireland, where there was no TV signal. A great bonus! They will crack the boredom anywhere."
2,They must be stupid,"OK, at first i wouldn't believe it but after verifying it, unfortunately it was true. Why would anyone in the world cut the series filmed 16:9 to 4:3 and put it like this on dvd? I mean, come on, why not make it black & white and be more artistic? I am sure that a vast majority of us already have widescreen TVs and this is the present and the future of television. Did the WB team even think a little bit? I must say that the HDTV encoded version recorded and encoded from TV has a higher quality than the DVD, so i'll stick to it. The show is amazing, that's the 2 stars rating for."
4,Gilmore Girls - The Complete Forth Season,Gilmore Girls - The Complete Fourth SeasonCompletely satisfied with product. Arrived in condition as described.
5,Gilmore Girls--good stuff,I bought this set for my 17 old daughter for Christmas. She says it is absolutely great. She loved it.
5,Great Show for Mother and Daughter to watch together!,"This season is great!! I enjoy this it helped me get a better realtionship with my mom than before. This is really a good show for people who is looking for a close realtionship between daughter and mom! Also there's Lot of realtionships going on that you could learn from those gilmore actors and actress. If you're looking for a show that involves a lot with romantic, comedian, and close friendships, this is the perfect season for you to watch. I would recommend you to watch Season One first so you understand the stories in the later seasons."
5,Works!,I got this bracelet for someone with arthritis and he said that it works. He no longer has stiff hands when he wakes in the morning and can actually make a fist in the morning.
5,MAD MONKEY-BUSINESS SKA,"THIS FLORIDA TRADITIONAL SKA BAND KEEPS YA MOVIN WITH HI-ENERYRIDDIMS, FANTASTIC VOCALS AND FIRST-RATE SONG-WRITING ABILITIES!THE INTERPLAY OF DRUMS & BASS IS SOME OF THE BEST I'VE HEARD.HIGHLY RECCOMENDED BY A SKA & REGGAE GUITARIST."
1,Whoa... dangerous....,"Again, a total waste of money from PRIMA. The author obviously HAS NOT fought enough human vs. human matches judging by the quality of advice in the manual.There are at least 2 FREE downloadable FAQ's on the net - do a google search and you should find them which are by far superior.Download these, make sure you and your mates read them, and then proceed to bash each other up!"
4,"gas OK, oil OK, water OK - let's go!","An excellent one volume guide to the park which has detailed trip logs, mileages, and points of interest assembled in an easy-to-read day trip format. Good historical perspective especially the ghost town and mining infomation. The author was suprintendent of the park in the 1980s when it was still classed as a National Monument and has a wide knowledge of the park and its many attractions. I recommend this book to all travellers by car (virtually 100%), but check carefully to see if the route is recommended for all cars or just 4WD rigs; the road conditions change frequently in the desert and the storms of 1998 and 1999 did considerable damage to once well-maintained routes so a call to a DVNP ranger station before adventuring would be advised."
3,Good introduction to DVNP,"This book provides a good general introduction to Death Valley, but lacks detail on hiking routes. If you're going to be hiking Death Valley, Michel Digonnet's ""Hiking Death Valley: A Guide to Its Natural Wonders & Mining Past"" provides better details. The Bryans' book covers more locations, but provides less detail on each."
1,Poor,"Can not watch the movie. It does not leave the title page, would not go to the option view. Very bad movie will never buy from this seller again!!"
1,WRONG PRINT,"the flag was printed wrong, the orientation and location of the black lines is all off, as well as the center circle."
5,Great holiday book,This is one of our favorite Thanksgiving books. My daughter loves being able to sing along with the words in the book. Great illustrations too!
1,strange angry faces in illustration,"I agree with other reviews that this book is a big fat disappointment. I wanted something lighthearted and fun but not ridiculous... well, unfortunately this book is not what I wanted. The facial expressions are too exaggerated and some are strangely angry."
3,Good course,"The course is great! The quality of the sound is good too. However, the cd's were obviously copied from a tape because they mention turning the tape over. Such things stand out to me, though when nobdy else cares. The actual content is very clear and easy to follow, and effective!"
3,"Very comprehensive, but exercises are very difficult","Deva's book is terrific; it very clearly describes the vocal mechanism with words and diagrams. However, the exercises on the 4 CDs are extremely difficult; Deva even indicates on the 1st CD (which should be the most ""elementary"") that the singer shouldn't initially expect to be able to even be able to execute a certain exercise. I believe there are methods with much less intimidating exercises for the non-professional singer."
2,Far from instructional,"This book was undoubtedly a nice presentation but this is far from an instruction book. The pictures are great and if you are the type of person who has a knack for braiding and styling hair, this is great for a reference but if you don't have the knack, you won't have it after reading this."
3,"Kids have bad hair days, too","The three star rating is only because I am horrible with hair and I thought I would get more in depth instruction. However, this is a great book for the basics of hair care for children. Instead of hair washing time being a chore, it has become something of a treat to my daughter.I have learned to take my time and respect SOME of her decisions about styles, and I have also learned to trust myself when it comes to her hair."
2,Just Okay,"I liked the pictures in this book because it gave me different hair styles to consider. I also liked the info. on hair care (trimming, washing, etc). But, I think the hairstyles should of been explained in more detail. For a person who's not familiar with different hair textures it's diffcult to understand (my daughter is biracial)."
3,Funky Stuff,"This CD captures the essence of the Bar Kays: gritty, funky and soulful. The only issue I have with the product is the murky, remixed version of ""Your Place or Mine""; I was hoping that it would be the radio mix that was popular in the 80's, but instead it is a pretty unlistenable version with the vocals buried deep in the mix. Otherwise, stellar."
1,Did Not Find Any Advanced Teaching Here,"If you like to read then this book is just as good as any other. I did not find any advanced teaching as this book promises. I have been initiated in the craft since 1971. Basically this book is about short stories which the author uses to expound her own threories or opinions. I think that this author is bashing the teachings of other authors that she doesn't like which comes through when she says, ""this is why"". The book is a dry read, very boring. Personally I would give it a O rating."
1,"But, I thought you said advanced...","While this book promises to reveal something beyond the basics of Wicca, it fails to deliver anything we've not seen time and time again in beginners books (and perhaps not even as much). Like the author's first book ""All One Wicca"" this one appears to be a hodge-podge of personal musings and self-styled Wicca bearing little if any resemblance to something authentic. If the author knew any ""advanced"" techniques or information, she certainly kept it a secret from this book."
5,Excellent Source For Wiccan Philosophy,"Thoughtful, pointed and provocative. This is an *excellent* source and starting point for discussion in Wiccan and Pagan philosophy and world view. This work is a great start to filling a gaping hole in Wiccan teaching. Kaatryn MacMorgan is opinionated, but well researched and well grounded in her views, and her purpose is to spark thought, research and more discussion. Her statements are sometimes bold, and tend to stir up the thought processes.Each chapter contains references to source material that can be used as a start for further discussion and more advanced topics. The book is suitable for solitary study, group discussions, or classroom situations.Others have pointed out that there are typos in the text, and there are several. However, substance is far more important, and this is an important work.I consider this a ""must read"" for any serious solitary or group studying Wicca seriously."
4,Very Interesting.,"I got the book and read it through over several weeks while I was working through my school-work. The presentation of the material was not for the novice and it was evident that at least a bit of previous research and learning was needed before this work was undertaken. Some of the aspects were somewhat questionable but I found the use of the dual sided argument, the siting of sources, and the repeated act of telling the reader to research and come up with their own opinion refreshing in a genre that seems to be geared more toward the fluffy side of religion. I wouldn't recommend this work for a basic student text but it should be read within the first couple of years if possible."
5,"Teachers can write good books, you know","Being a reader who happens to love books, I must say, even though I cannot write a decent story, my old Year Five teacher can.Having already heard the book, and its sequel which will be coming out soon, straight from the author herself, I just can't say that it isn't suitable for anyone. Maybe people who can't take a joke, yes, but that's all.'Snot', as she prefers to be called, is on a quest to find her mum a 'Mr Right' after her parents divorce. Laughs ensue. That's all I can say, besides the fact that 'Also known as Snot' is the first book of three (according to the author) and that it is a great read."
5,PRETTY IN PINK,"When these earings arrived this week I was more then happy withthem, they are two beautiful shades of pink crystals, and let meassure you they shine. Paris has really done an amazing job.They are very comfortable as well.If she makes a matching necklace I will buy it.Thanks Paris, they are hot Thanks Amazon.Com"
1,Sterling Silver and Crystal Heart Earrings by Paris Hilton,These earings were very poorly made.I returned them.The stones were put in very sloppy.They look very cheap.
3,these earrings are very feminine,"I think these earrings are so sweet and very feminine, I like them."
4,A good read!,"A well written short novel. Interest picks up as you read along. The details along the way are convincing, and the charactors intriguing. You'll feel pity for Cole, the variable man.A poor soul caught at the wrong place at the wrong time, yet has his place in a future during a time of war.The price is right, and it's a good read for a short evening. I enjoyed it."
4,Great Book,For such a short book theres a good bit of details and depth to the story. I love that the variable man is a general fix it man and able to adapt to a new world.
5,A master of the genre,"One of the titans of science fiction, PKD is always satisfying. Any fan of Asimov, Clarke, or Bradbury would enjoy the works of this author."
3,Thought provoking,"As always an interesting read by Philip K. Dick. I've read many of his works this is by no means my favorite, but it's worth the time to read. The characters are engaging and the action is well-placed."
5,Simple but very well written,"This was a short easy read, but the content was very thoughtful. It reminds me of Sci Fi written by the greats back in the 40s."
4,Another Camp Classic for Sharon Tate,"Final Installment of the Matt Helm series ( although a fifth Matt Helm movie was schelduled but never filmed. Dean Martin plays U.S counterpart to James Bond in this swinging plot to steal 1 billion in gold . Cheesy songs by Dean but great score by Hugo Montenegro ( wish the soundtrack was on vinyl or CD)and very funny performance by Sharon Tate- this has to be her best film role of the six films she co- starred in. Great 60's fashions, 60's glamour and even Tina Louise in a small role. Kung Fu Action as Bruce Lee was the advisor for the fight scenes . Look for Chuck Norris in a bit part."
4,Wrecking Crew - A Definite Choice for Martial Artisits,"Martial artists will be delighted by the Wrecking Crew.Several prominent martial artists of the sixties appear and the tuxedoed villians, Bruce Lee himself is credited as the ""karate advisor""."
5,Right back where I started,"This was the first Mahler Second I'd ever heard. Twenty five years of searching for the ideal recording of this work and I find myself right back here with this one. Whatever anyone else may have, no one comes close to the deep love and total conviction found in this performance."
5,Walter sure knew his Mahler...,"Bruno Walter conducted Mahler in a way that has not been surpassed. He brought out the power of the work, the little sub-themes in the work others neglect, and above all, the wild spirit of Mahler's music. This set showcased Mahler's early - and perhaps best - first and second symphonies."
5,essential,"If you are going to own Mahler Symphonies 1 & 2, you must own this. Oh, sure, treat yourself with versions by Bernstein, Kubelik, Barbirolli or Tilson Thomas, all good, but Walter is the gold standard. They can never take that Super Bowl ring from Bruno for these two."
2,Stones fall out - very disappointed,"I love Paris, I love her jewelery but was very sad that one stone was missing when I took it out of the pouch. I loved it so much I was willing to overlook the flaw but a few weeks later I noticed 6 stones missing. I am not hard on my jewelery but this is obviously a quality issue and I will be sending it back for a refund."
3,"Cute, but is it worth the price?",I don't own the bracelet but I wanted it for a while and then changed my mind. I give it 3 stars because it looks great but its a bit pricey and people complained about the stones falling out. You could probably find something similar at Claire's for way less then what you would pay for this.
2,Call for the D rad. A George Smiley Novel,Disappointed. I have read LeCarre before and would not have taken anymore if I had read this first. Too mixed up
4,Entertaining Read,This is a solid le Carre novel - toward the middle of the pack for him - but still better than 95 percent of spy/detective novels out there.
4,Different voice for LeCarre,"I've read most (if not all) of LeCarre's novels, and I appreciated the different ""voice"" in this one, and the fact that it's more of a standard murder mystery. The preface by the author regarding the process of writing was especially compelling, as it gave color to his other books as well. A pleasant, quick read."
3,Spy Novel,"I've read most of Le Carre's novels. I didn't think this was one of his best, but I still enjoyed it. It was worth purchasing."
5,"Simple, yet intriguing.","I should have read Le Carre years ago. Smiley, is the most unlikely hero. I can't wait to get the other novels with Smiley as the reluctant champion? Simply brilliant!"
3,Entertaining but sub par for Le Carre,"This is Le Carre's first novel. It is best known for introducing many of the characters that appear in his subsequent novels, George Smiley being the most prominent. This book is a short book that is both a murder mystery and an espionage thriller. I found the book entertaining but a bit disappointing, probably because I have read most of Le Carre's books and have come to greatly admire his story telling prowess and gifted prose. This first novel by the author hasn't the polish or sophistication that Le Carre ultimately evolved into."
1,Don't get this book!,"I am a middle schooler. For english I have to read stories in this stupid book. If you want to teach someone about short stories do not get this book! Some of the stories are a page long with no plot! Trust me, you don't want this!"
5,A gift every person deserves...,"I'm an ""ability focused"" disability awareness educator and I've adopted The North Star and its messages into my work with students for the past several years. With its messages of self-acceptance and acceptance of diversity, The North Star has been a natural companion for my own goals of helping students develop a greater appreciation of individual differences and abilities. This is a gift we all deserve, no matter what our age... no matter what obstacles we face in life.Besides the success I've had with The North Star in the classroom, it also has great meaning to me on a personal level. As someone living with a lifelong respiratory disability, reading The North Star for the first time felt like someone was smiling at me, and nodding... confirming and celebrating the person I am and the unique life I've led, and it made me believe it is the kind of life I want to continue leading."
3,Not as good as his others....,"I was expecting more based on the reviews I read. After reading it for the first time, my 7 year old and I both said, ""Huh. That was weird."" It's a nice book, just not quite what I expected."
3,"great ideas, slow read","I'm reading this book for a class so I might be slightly biased, I love discussing the book in class because we get to talk about his great ideas, but reading it on my own is slow-going and not enjoyable. Parts of it go by easily but with all the mentions of conflicts around the world part of it just seem too much like a history lesson."
4,In the name of identity,"Good book that makes a point about our days, understanding the role of religion on ex comunist countries and why islamist fanatics. But with too few analitic discussion"
1,Too smelly!!,This scent is too pungent! I had to wash it off as it was giving me a headache. Love the product so will have to find another scent.
1,waste of money,This cream was not the fragrance I had hoped for. It smells more like plastic than lilac. It takes awhile to absorb leaving a coating of white the skin. Will not purchase this brand again.
5,none other,My Husband has very sensitive and dry skin he has tried many products. This one is the very best for his condition and will not use anything else.
5,Camille Beckman Fan,I have very dry skin and usually develop rashes and blotches if I use any lotion with a bit of perfume. My daughter gave me a small container of Camille Beckman Glycerine Rosewater and it worked magnificently for me. I couldn't find it anywhere and someone told me to try Amazon! I am now buying the 32oz refill everytime I run out! Thank You
5,Cammile Beckman creams are wonderful,"As a CNA who washes her hands many, many times a day, this hand cream is great on my dry chapped hands in the winter. It's good for heels too. :) The oriental spice is a delicate, lovely scent."
3,Way too oily!,"This product disappoints me because it's not as great as the previous customers have said. I put a little bit of it on my hands and already could not stand the oily feeling on my skin.The tube is too soft to be squeezed without letting out a lot of cream at once.However, it does do a good job keep your hands moisture even after you wash them."
5,Love this lotion,I love the scent. I had a hard time finding a replacement to the first purchase I made of this product and was very happy to find it at Amazon. It's a nice lotion with a wonderful scent.
4,Good but not what expected,We had a small container of this quite a few years ago and it was more citrusy. This is great lotion! But we're disappointed that it has more of a floral scent than a citrus scent.
5,I love it. It is the best all around hand/foot cream I've ever used.,This is a great all around product. I have been using it for years. I use it on hands/feet/elbows. I love it.
5,I love it and recieved it quickly,I have recommended it to all my family and my doctor is the one that told me about it. it is great
5,Leaves hands feeling very soft,"I have a hard time in the winter keeping my hands from becoming very dry. Apply this when I go to bed, wake up the next morning, hands look and feel softer. I recommend this to all."
5,Off-Carrier Mobile App Development,"Ajit and Tony do a great job covering some of the issues facing off-carrier mobile application development. While you have your agenda, the mobile operator has theirs. Opengardens gives insight as to how both can exist and benefit from each other.The URL`s provided and sample data are worth the price of admission. If you're developing applications for mobile devices or even thinking about it, definitely give it a look.Richard FortenberryCTO\Xingtone.com"
2,okay for a beginner,"As I say, the book is okay for a beginning writer. Other than that it's, well, slop. Dunn has a gift for capturing moments, but none for holding them together in the novel form."
5,Great detailed overview of WW2,"I very much enjoyed this book. It gave a detailed overview of the events leading up to WW2, and many different phases of the war in Europe."
3,Asinine release.,"The remix is stellar sounding, however...Flaming Youth has an editing flaw. The so-called ""original"" sweet pain at the end is missing the end fade-out lead guitar. Why/ I thought the ""original"" solo was by Ace, and Dick Wagner did thye final one? So, shouldn't the Ace version be the bonus? And I will tell you why there's no mega bonuses: gene and Paul wouldn't make any money off of them, cuz this cd belongs to their old label, and the KISS boys don't own their masters anymore. BUT, sonically, it's really quite a good job by Ezrin. I'll give it that."
1,2 disks??,What happenedto all the extras? the whole second disk? Had I known I'd have saved my money and just waited for Sweet Pain to be on you ube. And that's not Kelly's original painting.
5,Resurrected.....,No complaints here. A Great Resurrection project by Bob himself.I'd buy all KISS albums from '74-'82 with this kind of Resurrection.
2,Kiss Resurrected not a great buy . Tinny Sounding,"I've been a huge kiss fan since Hotter than Hell came out and saw that tour and a ton of tours after that. So I'm a big Fan.I'm not a big fan of this record however. I am using a very high quality system to play it on (Marantz 4400 and Marantz 6300 Turntable) Real top of the line audio. The tone of this album is tinny. I couldn't believe that I had to turn up the bass to make it listenable.I'm a big Ace Frehley fan as well and the lead in Sweet Pain was terrible. It was a sub-par Ace Lead on this record, the lead that appeared on the regular Destroyer was great. Just leave it aloneall in all I'd say I bought a new Album cover but the vinyl isn't worth buying. Sorry. Cover looks cool however."
3,So where is the rest of it?,"What happened to the much Ballyhooed 2 CD Deluxe version with out-takes, etc? One disc, the bonus track is a version of Sweet Pain you already have. Sure it has been remixed. How much work has been done after the fact? Still the over the top Ezrin Production gets you every time."
2,"Overproduced, Overlush and Overated","This is not Kiss's best effort. They should have followed the hard rocking ""Alive"" with something better. Destroyer sounds forced, overproduced and overlush. There is alot of filler and alot of guest writers. Actually, this isn't really a Kiss record. Its a Bob Ezrin record and a crappy one at that. Kiss should have stuck with Eddie Kramer as producer. He gets the best out of Kiss and doesn't try to make them something they aren't. We can also thank Bob Ezrin for another blemish in the Kiss catalogue: The Elder.Best tracks: ""God of Thunder"", ""Detroit Rock City"""
2,Not as good as everyone thinks,"Destroyer was a different cd for Kiss. More Experimental. Their are classics though. Do You Love Me, Detroit Rock City, Shout it Out Loud, And of course Beth and God Of Thunder. The Rest are throwaways. I mean Sweet Pain And Great Expectations are great. Give me a break. And yes if you read my Asylum review. Asylum is better! I love Kiss. I have all their cd's, but this was just far from a classic."
2,This brings back memories...,"When I was in High School I borrowed this from a friend, I couldn't wait to get home and listen to what I heard was a classic 70's rock album. I listened to it and, What is this?? This album sucks. Detroit Rock City and Shout It Out Loud are are the only OK songs, the rest of the songs are laughable and just embarrassing to hear. I even listened to the song samples here at Amazon before writing this review and I have to admit they still sound terrible. Many people say this is their best album, but I actually think KISS Love Gun is a little better, because the previous albums were awful.I respect all the KISS fans, but I think they are one of the most overrated bands in history. Other 70's bands were years ahead of KISS and had much better albums than Destroyer. I'm talking about Boston's debut album and Don't Look Back, Bon Scott Era AC/DC's Let There Be Rock, UFO's Phenomenon, other material by Deep Purple, Rush...Overrated Band, Overrated Album."
2,Keep it Simple Stupid!,"I use to love kiss till i got into real music.Now they to me are a joke.This album is there best and i only give it 2 stars.Why you ask?Well punching out power chords all the time is boring.The song writing is not good at all.Aces solos a 5 year old can do.he bends the same string 14 times.The songs chorus never ends, half of most of the songs are just repeated lyrics.But i like a few songs so thats why i give it 2 stars.if your 18 dont buy this album.If your 5 up to 17 you mite like it."
3,"Same old, Same old.","Nothing new to hear on this CD. If you already have Destroyer in your collection, no need to purchased this CD."
3,Nothing new,Only a collector item. The cover is the only thing good. I got Vinyl and CD just because I'm a KISS fan.
4,Good buy for the die-hard KISS fan,Nice to hear a great album re-mastered with today's technology. Re-tooling gives this album an even wider scope to appreciate and includes a nice bonus track........Sweet Pain with Ace's original solo. Average fans won't find much use for this but the big KISS fan will appreciate this effort.
5,Sonic Justice!,Best remaster job I have ever heard! More than a remaster really. The original tapes have been enhanced and the cd sounds as if it were re-recorded today with today's modern technology. It's like listening to a new KISS album. I hope they do all their classics just like this!
2,Disappointed,"Although it is a somewhat-interesting remix, the bad edits spoil the overall results. Unless you're a diehard that knows every nuance of this recording, the more casual fans will say ""What's the difference?"".My biggest gripe is the lack of extras. No demos, no ""Ain't None Of Your Business"", no live stuff, sigh...I imagine they'll wait for the 40th anniversary or perhaps the 50th anniversary to include the proper extras. Suckered again..."
5,I NEED MORE STARS Than just 5,This is the album that introduced me to the group when I was only 4yrs old. This is my favorite since it captures a very special time for me. I loved it from the moment that the needle dropped on the intro track DRC and I initially listened to those mysterious voices reading the headlines. The fact that the group does not play on every track does not bother me at all. Sometimes the music speaks volumes or begins to do so years after the record goes into the collective dust bin. Destroyer sounds fresh today 2004 as it did then. Kiss created a wall of sound and fantasy that only elevated and layed the blue print of what they could accomplish.
5,Ultimate Rock & Roll from my childhood,"I remember sitting next to the stereo at 6 years old with the volume turned down listening to this LP because my Grandmother was convinced that Kiss were devil worshipers. This album has forever remained my favorite all-time rock & roll album. It represents everything cool about the late 70's...rebellion and just REAL rock. Gene Simmons seemed to have more vocals on this LP than the others, and perhaps even though he scared the hell out of me, I like him the most. Great Expectations will always remain my favorite Kiss song, as the lyrics are haunting. If you haven't had the chance to hear this in completion - you must!!"
5,Nice touches.,Cool to hear the subtle differences in the songs... A welcome addition to any collection. Nice to still see releases on vinyl!
4,Destroyer,What's not to say that hasn't been said? You wanted the best and you got the best! KISS Destroyer is a classic hard rock album that I enjoyed listening to. Beth feels oddly placed but is a great song nonetheless. Bought the CD over the MP3 for the album art looks awesome! It's a three page foldout with liner notes about the remaster and a cool kiss army logo inside. Check out KISS Destroyer!
2,Keep Hollywood ideology away from my music!,"I have been a fan since BEFORE the original release of this album. To ""remix"" it and market it is a travesty against the fans of this band who (me included) shell out the bucks for damn near anything with a KISS logo. I still remember the horror I felt when I first heard the ""remix"" of Detroit Rock City without the car crash and the poorly dubbed in ""Get ups"" and ""Get downs"" during the symphonic guitar solos.Hollywood has gone so far down the rabbit hole that they now resort to remaking moderately good films from the 80s (Total Recall? Really?) because nobody can be original any longer. There comes a time when the fans need to draw a line in the sand. Maybe this is it. You want to give me a NEW Destroyer? Re-record it with the current line up. Let Tommy and Eric sing a couple of tracks (Flaming Youth and Beth maybe). But STOP SCREWING WITH MY MEMORIES!"
4,Destroyer...still amazing..now just bigger and heavier!,"This will be short and sweet:1) The material kills....duh..right.2) The remixed versions are more powerful, fuller and sound amazing. My wife...heard 20 seconds and said..""Wow..that sounds amazing..what did you do to it?"" Nuff Said.3) This isn't meant to ""replace"" the original..it's a supplement to it.4) The intro to ""Flaming Youth"" IS a problem that shouldn't have been allowed to happen..so that is a bad thing. (Fix it..and it's 5 stars)5) No bonus material...for $8.00..who cares!!6) Kiss keeps ripping us off..?? Really..and when was the last time they forced anyone to spend one penny?? Don't want it..Don't buy it..and shut up.7) Bob Ezrin is a genius..and this a great addition to my KISS collection.8) See points 1 - 7Have a great day and KISS RULES!!!"
5,"UNBELIEVABLE, Kiss ROCKS,","Fantastic Resurrected album, Wish they did this to each one. Great new track at end. Love the Album. Even like the NEW art work. Thank You"
3,Try not to listen to the lyrics,"I actually am very fond of Kiss, and if you don't like ""Detroit Rock City,"" then why are you listening to this album in the first place?But Destroyer would have to be in the Hall of Fame of albums with embarrassing and unintentionally hilarious lyrics. Here are some examples of the guys' carefully crafted verses--You really like my limousine!You like the way the wheels roll!You like my seven inch leather heels!And goin' to all of the shows!...You watch me singing this songYou see what my mouth can do...The theme of almost all of the songs (""Beth"" being an obvious exception) is basically ""we are rock stars, we sleep with groupies."" Oh well...what do I know, maybe if that were true of me too that's all I would be able to think about when trying to come up with lyrics."
2,Waste of $$$$,"I was really excited to hear this ""remixed"" version, but am terribly disappointed. I have purchased quite a few 180 Gram reissue's and box sets, and have generally been very pleased with the sound and packaging.This album sounds horrible! Very brittle, heavy on high mids, and no bottom end. I don't know what the CD version sounds like, but this was a complete waste of money. Honestly, I think my original cassette sounds better!Wasn't expecting lots of ""extras"" or ""bonus tracks"". I was just expecting a kick ass version of one of my favorite albums, so I could crank it up and rock out. Even the cardboard that the album cover was made with is thin and cheap.The 180 Gram reissue of Alice Cooper's ""Welcome to my Nightmare"", also produced by Ezrin, sounds fantastic! Not sure why this sucks so bad?This was a complete a waste of time. KISS (or Bob Ezrin) actually managed to ""destroy"" Destroyer. So sad..."
4,"Not the best Kiss, but an okay release!","I don't have the original American release of the album but I do have the 1996 Japanese Imported release, and what's the difference, besides the fact that the import has an unfoldable booklet with lyrics and a message in Japanese, plus a booklike packaging?!"
5,Great revisit to Destroyer,I have the vinyl version and rocked it soon as I got it in.To me it sounds more modern. The drums and bass are more out front.I like the guitar in Beth and love Ace's solo in Sweet Pain.Bob Ezrin did a great job on this!
3,Do You Love Me....,"I remember I think it was like the third grade way back in 1977 when I was in a class of kids who liked Kiss. They were blasting ""Do You Love Me"" from the record which was on a cheesy classroom turntable where they would play ""kiddie records"". (The teacher wasnt there, I dont know where she was!) All the girls got mad, and when they heard ""Do You Love Me?"" from that song, one of the girls named Tammy screamed ""I Hate Your Guts!!!!"" LOL. I'll never forget that."
4,those were the days....,"like just about every kid who grew up in the late 70s, i was a serious KISS freak -- i had absolutely every record they released. they sure sounded great at the time, but, let's face it: they haven't aged well. DESTROYER is the exception -- it still holds up after all these years. it still sounds fresh and exciting to my ears and it makes me feel like i'm ten years old again. i know this is probably the corniest review in Amazon.com's history, but i hope i'm making my point...."
4,Destroyer is the coolest CD from KISS!,"Destroyer rocks from the lively beat of ""Detroit Rock City"" to the slow movement of ""Beth"". It is a good CD, but some of it can be considered not as good, but that is entirely an opinion. Destroyer is still a great CD and is worthy to have a copy to every person, young or old!"
5,Awesome,It has a variety of sounds from beth to god of thunder. It is one of their best albums . Buy it now.
5,Oh SWEET!,"Remastered goodness! Kiss rocks so hard it's the ultimate hardness. I am so syked about this recording. I love this band. Detroit Rock City 4 Ever let me tell you. I listen to this album when I get up in the morning, I listen to it when I speed to work in the afternoon. I listen to this when I'm getting syked to get together with my lady. It puts me in the mood!! This is rock and roll at its finest, like a hot blonde with a tight body and a fast car. I love Kiss! Rock and Roll!!"
2,Destroyed,"Since original producer Bob Ezrin was in charge, I was expecting he'd show some tender loving care for this album. And well, maybe he did. But I'll never be able to tell because I couldn't suffer more than a couple of minutes of Destroyer Resurrected. Half way through Detroit Rock City, I was done w/ the album.I don't know to what extent Ezrin is responsible, or whether it was the privilege of the mastering engineer to butcher the album (I suspect so), but the result is nasty. Way too much compression, way too much limiting - some nasty artifacts and distortion - over-accentuated high frequencies, and so on.Which is somewhat surprising considering how refreshingly light-handed were the remasters of the original Kiss albums, including Destroyer.My take on it - if you care at all for the actual sound quality of the album, buy the original. If you want it louder, turn up the volume. If you want it brighter, use the EQ."
2,Too Experimental for Kiss,"I think this is an alright Kiss record...the only good songs on here are pretty much classics like Detriot Rock City, God Of Thunder, Beth, Shout it Out Loud, Do You Love Me are the best on here but the rest are the worst Kiss songs in history. Good albam to get anyway...get it"
2,Highly overrated,"This album is so cheesy i can't bare to listen to it. Detroit Rock City is ok, but rest stink. Not the classic it's made out to be."
1,"""Deluxe 2cd edition""?","False advertising or bad quality control? Either way the people that pre-ordered this for the bonus material/2nd disc as it was advertised got fooled. Many didn't even know until they got it in the mail. 2 weeks prior to the release they stopped taking orders for the ""Deluxe 2cd edition"". I don't believe the explanation that some have given, blaming Amazon for getting their info from ""unofficial"" sources. Amazon is selling a lot of their cds so I'm pretty sure they're getting info directly from the record companies on pre-orders. Did someone at KI$$ corp see how much interest there was in the unreleased demos & decide to hold them back for future re-re-releases of the entire set? I'm very disappointed in the current state of this band that I once considered one of my favorites."
3,Not terrible but worth the few bucks,"Got the cd on release day. Heard the skip in Flamming Youth it was a bit annoying as with the back cover being blue. But overall the sound is pretty good if you like beefier bass and drums. The extra set of ""get up, get down"" was pretty lame as long with the ace solo in Sweet Pain that sounds like it wasnt even recorded for that song. The extra awww in Beth is ok, i kind of wish they would of left everything original and just beef up the sound. With releases like the Kiss box set the booklet is best part of the set.Got the vinyl today after preordering it and amazon ran out. I hear no skip in Flaming Youth but the vinyl sounds damn good but wheres the bonus track of Sweet Pain with the original solo?Overall its good but i doubt this will replace my original version."
4,Good,"Followup to platinum success of Alive is one of the best studio albums of their career. The Peter Criss ballad Beth was a surprise hit on their heaviest album since the debut. Key tracks are: Detroit Rock City, God of Thunder and Beth. They are not a one hit wonder. Rock and Roll All Night, I Was Made for Loving You and Shandi also charted as singles."
4,well made,this was a great band...it encourage to have -you know what- freely! It was great! just like led zeppelin! i like riffs very much ! lyrics are great! detroit rock city and beth are the only songs i don't like!
4,A very good rock album by the Gods Of Greed.,"A very good rock album by the Gods Of Greed. DESTROYER has aged remarkably well, better than the other albums of that period (the first line-up). There are orchestrations, some bold steps, and a general"
4,My Kiss fanatacism peaked with Destroyer,I grew up with Kiss in the 1970s and they were my fav band back in that era when I was a young teen and this was probably the lp that left the best memories of that time for me. For some reason 'great expectations' always brings me back to a Christmas gathering/dinner at my house and I just get very nostalgic for this lp. I may actually buy it again. ;)
5,The Consumate Kiss Album,"If anyone wants to start a Kiss collection, this is the one album that beginning listeners and the Kiss Army have in their CD players. It has the best tracks ever put down by this supergroup. That is saying a mouthful, because Kiss has recorded a myriad of classic material-from '73 to present day. ""Shout It Out Loud"" is the rock-n-roll anthem (but is usually eclipsed by ""Rock-n-Roll All Nite""), ""God of Thunder"" is booming Gene at his best, and ""Do You Love Me"" puts us all in the shoes of these rock-n-roll gods. I can say yes, I do love Kiss and own every single album. I know from what I speak. Buy this album, be happy."
1,A Cat solves the mystery????? PLEASE!!,"I can't believe that P.C. would think her readers would say ""O.K. yeah, I think a cat could solve the mystery, they are very smart animals, you know, they notice things like city light."" COME ON! I think this book was written for cats. They would enjoy it more. The cat was the only smart character in the book. I was terribly dissapointed in this book. Better luck next time.......a CAT!!!???!! Come on!........cat....huh...that's a good one."
1,Recipe-Overcooked,"P.Cornwall has re-used this recipe of hers too many times. It's overcooked. I'm getting the feeling that she cranks out a book at such a fast pace simply to make a buck. I used to truly enjoy her books. But honestly, my last favorite was Potter's Field."
1,"Total suprise for Cornwell, One of the worst books ever.","Extremely suprised, based on the quality of her previous books. all of her other books, in my opinion, would receive 4-5 starts. I just could not belive how bad this book was. A total waste of money."
1,VERY POOR IN PUTTING IT TOGETHER,"I was very unhappy with the book. It had more cliches than a bad movie. I ralley enjoyed all her other books and have read them all. Patrica please stay away from writting any more like the Horneets Nest. In the book there was so much jumping around from it was hard to tell who was who and then in some places you never did find out how others ended up. I am really not sure I will buy another one of her books again, sorry. Yours truly Peggy Henry of Maple Valley, Washington."
2,Still Wondering,I found Hornest's Nest hard to get into. The story and plot slow and I was always wondering when Dr. Scarpetta was going to get involved. Then I couldn't put it down. I thought it was great that West and Brazil got together could be interesting for a future series? I thought the ending was very disappointing and I felt like the book wrapped up too fast and as a reader you were left hanging. Would be interested to see if Ms. Cornwell will continue with these characters.
2,A little better than watching paint dry.,"Not really a novel, more like a few concurrent episodes from a soap. It killed a dull afternoon though."
2,Disappointing,"The surprise in Hornet's Nest is that Patricia Cornwell wrote it. Not much focus, too many characters, too much background on trivial ones, no development of interest. Read as if it was a collection of ideas for a new series, trying to note threads and details to be used later. Not very professional compared to her past books. Loved Hammer, couldn't care about Brazil, West, Goode, Cahoon. Very one dimensional."
1,hornet's nest of a brain,"How disappointing. An investigative reporter who ""decompensates"" when his stories are being hacked, instead of finding out who did it? A cat who gives a clue by dragging wet panties and a five-dollar bill on his mistress' face? Gimme a break.There's only one fairly well-developed character in this entire book (Hammer), and even she isn't entirely believable. This book is a mess, and not worth the money or the trees killed to print it. PC didn't even bother ending it -- it just stops. Is PC decompensating? How else to explain why such an ordinarily fine writer allows such a mess to be printed? And her editors should be ashamed of themselves for allowing such a reputation-destroying book to be published."
1,Who decided to publish the first draft??,"I've been enjoying Scarpetta (although I was annoyed that Cornwell ducked working out the emotional issues by just having her love interest die ""off camera"") -- but what is this mish-mash? Some of the individual scenes were very well written, but overall the book was sprawling and lacked direction. It also sounded like an unfortunate attempt to capitalize on ""The Cat Who . . ."" (which I can't read), and an unsuccessful attempt to capitalize on Rita Mae Brown and Sneakey Pie (which I love). By the way, has Patricia Cornwell ever actually seen an Abyssinian? They look like miniature mountain lions and have wonderful golden eyes, not crossed blue eyes (that's a Siamese)."
1,Fire your editor,"I have read and enjoyed PC's previous books, though felt that the quality was trending down. The Hornet's Nest was a particular disappointment. There were glimmers of good writing but the plot was meandering and far-fetched. Some of the characters had realistic and interesting roles, others were flat and unnecessary. This novel lacked direction, tightness and most of all, good editing. Patricia, your editor should be doing better by you! If you are being pushed to publish tell them to back off! We will wait. So, please, take a vacation, refresh yourself and keep writing!"
2,Hornets Nest Stung Where the Sun Dont Shine,"Patrica Cornwell severely missed the point of Volunteer Police Officers in this tale of Crime and Drama. Surprising since she did such a wonderfull job on all the Kay Skarpetta novels. The main characters, Brazil and Hammer show such incompetence it's a wonder either of them get's their badge pinned un right side up. Hopefully the next Skarpetta novel will bring her back to the basic Police realism we have come to enjoy."
4,Fun!,"After reading all of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books, it was such a relief to pick up ""Hornet's Nest."" Although addicted to Kay, I find her and all of her co-characters incredibly irritating. At last, at last, Cornwell has come up with characters who are LIKEABLE. Andy Brazil is downright endearing, and Chief Hammer is the character Kay Scarpetta wishes she could be. A lot of people have complained that ""Hornet's Nest"" looks like a book written by a completely different author. I have to agree, but not as a complaint. It looks to me like Cornwell has finally learned to write."
4,"Great Plot, action the whole time.","I thought it was an exceptionally good book. But if at all possible, the language was what needed toned down. The ending was cut off though, what happened after that"
1,In Need of an Editor!,"Did Patricia Cornwall dictate this in her sleep and send it directly to the printer? This book is a mess - the sentences are too long, she editorializes endlessly and it's very disorganized on a most basic level. On every page there is at least one example of the total lack of editing or revision this book really needed. Sentences that follow one after the other have no relation to each other. The Kay Scarpetta books don't compete with Jane Austen for style, but they have basic narrative continuity. This is just a disaster."
2,Please don't stray from Scarpetta again!,"Hornet's Nest is a complete disappointment.As an avid reader of Cornwall's books, I had to keep glancing at the jacket to be sure this was written by Patricia Cornwall and not someone else. The book seems to have been written to meet a deadline - the story is flat, the characters are flat and the editing is nonexistant!Either this was ghost written or Cornwall has a multiple personality disorder and this personality never took an English or Composition class. Cornwall seems to have forgotten everything she learned about run-on sentences, syntax and punctuation.Don't bother."
1,Dissapointed,"I originally bought Southern Cross and dropped after page 10, then decided to give the first book of this series a chance since I love the Kay Scarpetta Series how different could this one be, but a fan can do so much. I am an avid reader and I can still count with one hand the books I've dropped in my life."
1,In a Word: Terrible.,"I've heard good things about Ms. Cornwell's books. Perhaps I started at the wrong end of her literary scale. The book title and jacket cover had me expecting an intellectual thrill ride. Instead, what I got was a boring and aimless exploration of three characters who were about as intriguing as a dead goldfish. I kept waiting for relevance to the plot to emerge. Then, after fifteen chapters or so, I realized there was no plot. The actual crimes that appeared to be the point to the book were in fact an afterthought - the story could have been condensed down to two paragraphs like you'd find on page eleven of the Metro section. I did a better job of getting to the point (and making a point) when I was in fourth grade. This was a waste of several hours of my life that I'll never get back."
1,Patricia - What Happened.This one blew your Great reputation,Hornet's Nest was very disappointing. I read all of Patricia Cornwell's novels and this one was just very badly written. The worst part for me was when the cat started sharing an opinion at the end of the book! Huh.. Stick to Kay and real life characters... This took me a year to finish.. I kept picking up better books and wondering if the book would get better.
1,Yuck! This Book Was Too Nasty to Finish!,Yuck! This book is waaaayyyy below the standard that Cornwell set for herself in the Kay Scarpetta series. It's badly written with characters that are so nasty and disgusting that you want to take a shower when you put the book down. I couldn't even finish it.
2,A sell-out,"Patricia Cornwell is a great author, as I have read all her books that preceded this. I was ready for a change from Kay Scarpetta, and kept an open mind - however this book just slagged on and it seemed too much like what I call the Microsoft Word macro 'what would a cheesy bestseller author say now' was in full-force. Like another one of my old faves, Dean Koontz, this novel was chock full of 'plug ins' that are rampant amongst the bestseller 'read em quick, I am going to keep you up, here comes something sleazy' disease. I am NOT an arrogant 'I don't read bestsellers' person, as I look to books for entertainment as opposed to the mass wasteland of TV - however I hate to see great authors stoop below what I think they are capable of - there is nothing like a great book - and this is one that is good, but only if you have nothing else left in your bookshelf to read!"
1,Not a typical Patricia Cornwell novel,"I have read some of the reviews of ""Hornet's Nest"". I too was very disappointed by this recent Cornwell novel. Most people are saying that she should stick with the Scarpetta character. I personally don't care who she writes about, I just want her to write how she did before. It is kind of refreshing to start a whole new set of characters but the writing just wasn't her usual style. There was too many small story lines and no big surprise at the end. I almost put the book down at page 210 but I couldn't make myself do it. I will not buy Southern Cross."
1,Stinky!,"The real mystery here is who actually wrote this novel: it's such a poorly conceived, badly written, and atrociously edited book that I had difficulty believing the same person who brought us the Scarpetta stories could have authored this. Now Cornwell's come out with a follow-up novel (""Southern Cross"") that I wouldn't touch with a proverbial ten-foot pole. Unless you're a literary critic who enjoys guffawing over really bad prose, stay away from these recent Cornwell creations."
2,Cornwell Pens Police Yawner,"Patricia Cornwell, author of the tautly written Kay Scarpetta series, turns her focus to police fiction, and the result is an exceedingly dull Harlequin Romance reject. Character development is strictly black-and-white, perhaps in keeping with the police theme. Her Police Chief Hammer fairly walks on water, while we have other cartoonishly one-dimensional characters, such as the mayor, who is concerned only with the serial murders' effects on tourism (He wants the sainted Chief Hammer to report a 105% rate of closing crimes.) The list goes on: the eager cub reporter, the grizzled night editor, the female cop who rose through the ranks. Worst of all, Cornwell forgets to have a point to all this. The murders serve only as a backdrop to a sloppy half-baked romance, and the whole mystery comes to a rather abrupt conclusion, almost an afterthought. Suspense, drama and even crime are almost entirely lacking from this so-called thriller. Stick to Scarpetta ... please!"
1,Cornwell should stick with her Scarpetta series.,Being a fan of Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta series I was very disappointed in this story. I read this book and was unimpressed with the characters. It seems to be lazily written. Cornwell should stick with her Scarpetta series.
1,"Scarpetta, this ain't.","A diehard fan of Cornwell and Scarpetta, I bought this book without reading the flyleaf. After my initial disappointment due to the absence of Scarpetta, I went back to the beginning again in order to clear my brain for an open-minded read of new characters. Throughout the book I would go back again to a character (or characters) trying to get a fix on who they were or were trying to be. Nothing worked. By the end of the book I was convinced that either Cornwell did not write the Scarpetta novels or she did not write Hornet's Nest. The vast difference between these writings are palpable and real. For this reason, I left Southern Cross on the shelf. Less than 1 star rating."
1,How bad can it get?,"Having read all of Cornwells previous books, I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this book. Maybe I've just gotten too comfortable with the Scarpetta/Marino characters, but those two characters are the only reasons why I even bothered to continue reading Cornwells books.I tried to read the Hornet's Nest, but couldn't get into it..too many damn women and just not the same feel as with ""Scarpetta"" novels...wasted my money on this one."
2,"WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO KAY SCARPETTA?? BRING HER BACK, PLEASE!",I was so disappointed in this book. I bought it thinking of the previous Kay Scarpetta books. Boy was I surprised
1,What has happened to Patricia Cornwell?,"This book was horrible. I have enjoyed all of her previous books, but this one was boring and hard to read. I hope her next book is better, though I can't see how it could be any worse"
4,suprisingly enjoyable,"I first received this book years ago and, because of the bad reviews, I let my girlfriend read it first. She told me that it was just okay for a Cornwell novel, so I just let it sit on my bookcase until just recently. I read it in just a few days and I really enjoyed it. I believe that people are looking at this book and expecting your typical Kay format. I believe that Ms. Cornwell developed her characters extremely well with some great baggage to haul with them from chapter to chapter. If the reader just scans the book without taking the time to see the big picture, they are likely to agree with many other reviews. I highly enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading Southern Cross to take me to the next step in these character's lives."
1,College English Project?,"Face it folks, this is not a current Patricia Cornwell novel. Read the first 10 pages again. This is not the same woman! Eliminating alien possession, the opinion here is that in an effort to now capitalize on her fame and growing fortune she has dusted off something she wrote in college (high school?) rewritten portions of it to update and foisted it on an unsuspecting public.You can tell in the first 10 pages where Cornwell Today went back and updated Cornwell of Yesterday. her description of Charlotte is obviously written now, yet wedged in among paragraphs she wrote years ago.What's next a short story from grade school"
3,What in the world happened?,"As a loyal fan of PC, I must say I was disappointed by her book. Aside from the fact that Kay was shining through her absence, there was nothing else to make up for it. The characters were pitiful, the plot was non-existant. The biggest part of the book was filled with Brazil fighting off police crime lines just to get close to the action. That's a character?! When the last couple of pages came about, I finally remembered we were looking for a killer.Just ask yourself: Would it be worth it to buy it and read it on a long flight? Definitely not. Stick to Kay, or at least to the same writing style that made us your fans in the first place."
1,"If you enjoy Patricia Cornwell, don't read this one.","I hope we will someday learn about how this novel came to be written AND PUBLISHED. It has several elements of her other novels, but I am of the opinion that this novel had to have been written prior to the novels that gave her the fame she deserves. This one should never have been published (except maybe posthumorously). It may have served as a writing exercise to vent her emotions and feelings, but is more like a pallet of soap boxes. Like a dead corpse, this book would be an excellent literary work to perform an autopsy on to discover in any elements of the real Patricia Cornwell. I will try and forget that this one ever existed and continue to check her new books out from the library"
1,"Exterminate ""Hornet's Nest""","Character study, smaracter study. Patricia Cornwell is one of the best crime fiction writers of the century -- but what was she thinking? ""Hornet's Nest"" is best left to the Orkin Man. Were we supposed to like Virginia or hate her? And what about Judy -- her character development took an abrupt about-face midway through the book and left the reader confused and wishing Seth had turned the gun on Ms. Cornwell! Perhaps this is the way law enforcement officials behave in North Carolina, but Kay Scarpetta never enlisted the help of a clairvoyant cat to solve a crime. Let's hope that Patricia Cornwell lets sleeping dogs lie and forgets about the characters she's created in this book. And thank you, thank you, thank you for giving us ""Unnatural Exposure!&quot"
1,Damn near unreadable - hated it!,"I found this book very poorly written, the story lousy, the plot incomprehensible. Patricia, stick with what you do best - your Kay Scarpetta novels! They are GREAT"
2,Not in keeping with her usual style.,"Being a fan of Patricia Cornwell's Dr. Kay Scarpetta character, I was very disappointed by Hornet's Nest. The character depth just wasn't as elaborate as in her other books. The characters were actually unlikable to me. I was unable to care what happened to any of them. This was very disappointing coming from the creator of Kay Scarpetta and Pete Marino"
1,Southern Cross,"I have enjoyed reading Patricia's series about Dr. Scarpetta so when she came out with Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross, I was excited about reading them. I found them both to be very disjointed and hard to read. I got very frustrated when reading them both and I don't believe I will read anything else pertaining to Chief Judy Hammer, Virginia West, or Andy Brazil. I'll stick to the Scarpetta series."
2,I wish I'd read these reviews first,"I, too, am a huge fan of Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. I mistakenly thought Hornet's Nest was part of that series. Once I realized it wasn't, I hoped the characters in the book would be as well developed as the characters in the Scarpetta series. I was sorely disappointed. I guess, though, when you've written as many excellent books as Cornwell has, you're entitled to a flop."
1,BOOOORING,"This was my first and last Patricia Cornwell book. Everyone says how great the Kay Scarpetta series is, but I was so turned off by Hornet's Nest that I will never pick up another book of hers again.The other negative reviews pretty much say it all, except for one thing: I hated Andy Brazil. What an incredible loser. Just reading about how this eager beaver kept losing weight and had to switch back to his high school clothes made me cringe.I wanted someone to slam a fist into his too-pretty face.And I was mad at Virginia West for getting involved with this baby boy.Seth's flesh-eating disease was a nice distraction from the rest of the crap this book contained, but it wasn't enough. No more Cornwell for me."
1,Hornet's Nest - Audio Version,"I didn't want to rate this book because I never finished it. Actually, I barely started it. Chris Sarandon's reading of the story was so annoying to hear I turned it off after about 10 minutes. He doesn't tell the story, he reports it. I may try reading the book, but then maybe not, after seeing other reader's reviews."
2,Missed the boat,"This novel was a disappointment. Cornwell didn't seem to like any of her characters and didn't develop them (well, okay, Niles the cat was pretty good). Judy Hammer had possibilities but was left flat. If you haven't read any of Cornwell's usually engrossing novels, don't start with this one."
1,I want Kay Scarpetta back !!,"Hornet's Nest is not half as good as any of the Scarpetta books. This book is not a thriller at all. Please Ms Cornwell, go back to the Scarpetta series."
1,Stung by Hornet's Nest,"Patricia Cornwell is a tremendous storyteller ... most of the time. Hornet's Nest marks the rare exception. Lucy, Dr. Scarpetta, Marino, et al, are captivating characters; why the author took a detour from their storyline is beyond me. I'm glad I read reviews of the followup, Southern Cross, first and didn't make the same mistake twice."
2,DECEIVING!,"I don't understand why P. Cornwell has written this book. The subject is not interesting at all and the story makes no sense, at the end you don't have an explanation for the killing. Moreover, sometimes it's badly written. If you have read other books from P.C. you would think the this book was not written by her. The books on Dr. kay Scarpetta were much better and she should go back to her."
3,Better than average police novel.,Having read some of the other reviews of this book (after reading the book myself) I was somewhat surprised. I found the characters to be charming and the story engrossing. This was the first Cornwell book I have read and am looking forward to the Scarpetta series and Southern Cross.
1,Not worth finishing,"I am glad that I am not the only one who hated this book. I read about 1/3 of it and I just couldn't find a reason to keep reading. I, like most of the other reviewers, love the Scarpetta series. I am not thrilled that so many people have revealed that Benton dies. I have not read the last book. Thanks for nothing."
1,This book completely disappointed me.,"I bought this book, without even checking to see if it was a Scarpetta novel. That was my mistake, but even so how was I to know that the characters would be unlikeable and completely annoying. I did not make it through half of this book, where I normally read a novel in a couple days. I loved all her other books, and I am sad to say this novel is a total waste of time."
2,"Boring, too long, disjointed, undeveloped plot","I felt this book was too long - by about 150 pages. The plot was very disjointed, hard to follow and not very well developed. I found too many staements that were incorrect. Worst book of hers I ever read."
4,Hornet's Nest,"I just finished the book and I loved it. I am surprised so many others were so negative about it. I have read many of her books and have enjoyed them all. I feel the characters in this book were real as they protrayed people with real problems and complicated lives, just like life is. I thought is was very funny in parts and would like to read more of her work with these characters."
1,Experiment gone awry,"I've enjoyed several of the Kay Scarpetta books, but was open to reading about new characters too. And there are some interesting characters in this book. Unfortunately, not the main characters who are all garden variety supermen/women. Borrrrring. (And if they're all so brilliant, why is a cat the one to figure out the mystery, such as it is?) The style of getting into the consciousness of all of the characters was kind of interesting, but not enough so to make up for the lack of plot. Or was the plot supposed to be the interpersonal stuff between the characters? I couldn't figure out what was going on there, or maybe I just didn't care enough about the characters to try. I wish I could take back the hours I wasted reading this book."
1,Truly awful,"I am a big fan of Patricia Cromwell, and I found it hard to believe that this book was written by the same person. It was so tedious and poorly written that I didn't even finish it. I kept debating whether it may have been her very first attempt at writing that she published now or one written by someone else. Even the sale price is too much to waste on this one."
4,Translated Version,"I'm sorry to say that I read the Japanese-translated version of this book, but it was fun none-the-less. The details were not as gruesome as some of Cornwell's other stories (though I love them all) so it was great to read on the way to office and not be as rattled."
1,0 for two,"I read one other Cornwell book, Point of Origin, and I thought it was bad. But this one really reeks. There is no real plot at all, and her flip-flopping focus makes it hard to figure out what (if anything) is going on. I kept waiting to see which of the ""elegant, beautiful, older, intelligent"" women, one the Chief of police & the other head of investigations, the 22 year old blonde adonis would end up with. What a waste of time. The characters were unrealistic, the situations implausible, and the plot(?) boring. I find it amazing that Ms. Cornwell continues to be a ""popular"" artist. Frankly, I think I'd rather have a stick in the eye than have to suffer through another of her ""novels"". I got nothing from this book. I learned nothing new factually, I gained no insights into people, I got NOTHING. What a waste of time."
2,"An attempt at something different, with fair success","It appears that Ms. Cornwell was trying to write more of a psychological novel than her previous mysteries. In doing so, she expanded to the points of view of many more characters, in a sense showing that what one sees and assumes is not always correct. She perhaps went too far when she included ""the Almighty"" in her characters! The regular characters were not developed enough, especially in regard to history. The murders seemed to take a back seat and were solved incidentally (and would not have been solved otherwise). This is such a radical change from her series about Kay Scarpetta that it feels disappointing. However, I did finish the book without too much difficulty. I applaud Ms. Cornwell for attempting a new approach, and wish her the best of luck in exploring what are clearly some of her own issues.Melissa Lenihan"
2,"Oh Man, I paid twenty bucks for this????","I'm a Cornwell fan, and I feel I'm using the wrong tense. ""was"" might be more appropriate, after reading Hornet's Nest. Theories abound on the writing of this stinker: it's an old Cornwell unpub dredged up to meet a deadline: Cornwell didn't write it; Cornwell wrote it but Didn't write the Scarpetta books; ad nauseam. But the scariest theory for me is that Cornwell wrote it and thought it was Good! Second scariest theory: Cornwell suffered an attack of hubris, and felt anything she wrote would satisfy her adoring public. Wrong. Very wrong. This one is dreadful. Sorry I wasted my money. Leave the procedurals to McBain, who I now appreciate even more after reading an unsuccessful procedural. And finally, one last theory -- previous critic NTSH10(above) is really Patricia Cornwell"
1,Who really wrote this thing?,"I have four speculations about the origins of this book: 1) Cornwell is suffering from some malady that caused her to be unable to meet her deadline, so she had it ghostwritten, 2) It's really her first novel, written when she was a promising high-school senior, 3) She was tripping the whole time she was writing it and consequently put down every thought that fluttered through her mind without regard to plot, pacing, characterization, or good sense, or 4) She convinced herself she was writing an experimental novel--part wry comedy, part stream of consciousness (it's hard to keep track of just whose, since the point of view changes faster than Seth's hip measurement), part police procedural (I don't know--do police really proceed in this manner?). The book is certainly readable, occasionally fun, and bold in the sense that in it Cornwell breaks every rule her writing teacher tried to teach her"
1,Don't waste your time.,"If this was PC's first book it never would have been published.Whatever was going on for her that she needed to set it on paperproved a big mistake. Bad dialogue, bad plot and women's issuesthat were one dimentional and set women back fifty years. Womenwho could get it together to make the climb professionally butcouldn't make it on a personal level? Where is she coming from? Herstrength has always been research in her Kay Scarpetta novels,what happened with this one?"
1,Is Cornwell on a feminist soapbox?,"The mystery lover and Kay Scarpetta fan that I am was shocked by the twist that Patricia Cornwell has taken in her writing. I found the tone of ""Hornet's Nest"" both offensive and laughable with her preoccupation with the scourages of women over 40 and their amazing ability to always look all-knowing, beautiful, and more powerful (Batman and Robin)than every man in the book. Even the murder victims were these ""weak"" men. Several times I had to try to remember what the plot was...it was like ""Oh, by the way, there is a killer lose in the midst of all this muck and mire of characters."" Very disappointing effort by Miss Cornwell"
2,Not the best work of this fine writer,Hornets Nest was a disappointment without the trials of Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Police Chief Judy Hammer did nothing for me. I found this book a diffucult read. It failed to hold my interest
2,What a disappointment!,"Don't waste your time or money on this one. It is not what one expects from Patricia Cornwell. The characters are superficial, the overall tone is bitchy in the extreme, there is no plot - a complete flop"
1,"Is this a ""contract"" book? It's awful -- NOT RECOMMENDED","I'm a real Patricia Cornwell fan, and I opened ""Hornet's Nest"" with great expectations -- expecting more of Kay Scarpatta.No Kay? That was disappointment number one.Who are these people? Flat, improbable, cut from cardboard and dropped into the word processor with the hope that a plot will gel and a story emerge.It never did.I kept reading, waiting for the magic, for the point where the book would take off. It never did, and the end was as laboured as the beginning.This one's a dog -- I'm looking forward to more of KS, but please spare me the Charlotte Police Dept."
1,Dropped Without an Ending,"I thought it was difficult to get into. Then it was hard to follow where it was going with plot, and relationships. Finally when I thought I was following to the end, there was none. I turned the page for the ending and found I had just read the end. Horrible! Read the whole confusing book to be dropped with no ending!"
3,"I love Cornwell, so this is hard for me. :)","I love Patricia Cornwell and it is hard for me not to like one of her books. Let's just say, she wrote much better stories. She is a first rate author."
3,Blackwidow,"Cornwell over whelmed me with all of the new characters that she has woven into her story. Her plot is a serial killer, the Black Widow, who focuses on out-of-town businessmen. Cornwell became side tracked with all of the political discord. You wonder when Scarpetta has the time to do her other autopsies. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above the River."""
3,Wasp's Nest,"This book appears to have stirred up a stinging nest of its own, based on reviews from other readers ... I haven't read Cornwell before, but I found this book very readable. I, too, thought her style was more forensics and was looking for that, but obviously the interaction of the characters was more the point of this book. I finished it this morning and was disappointed with the ending ... I'm on line now because it seems fairly obvious that Cornwell was setting the scene for more with these characters. Did someone say, ""Southern Cross?"""
2,Disappointing book,"Being an avid Patricia Cornwell reader, I was very disappointed with Hornet's Nest. I was expecting the novel to be an interesting and exciting read, however, found it to be convoluted and often times confusing. I finished the book only because I felt I had to give it a chance to get better. It didn't. I would suggest that Ms. Cornwell stick with Dr. Kay Scarpetta - she has found her niche there and has yet to disappoint in that area (let's hope she never does)"
1,"Like the characters, hate the book","It seems to me that Cornwall divies up Dr. Kay Scarpetta's character to create Judy Hammer and Virginia West. I enjoyed them, and while I am clear on their eating habits, clothing preferences and fast food obsessions, I never got to the core of what made these characters tick. They were enjoyable none-the-less.It is the sloppy, poorly conceived and terribly paced story line that destroys the experience. The book felt as though it went directly from legal pad to printing press with no editing or revision. I am a recent Cornwall fan and have read most of her oeuvre since September. They have been spellbinding, well-paced and consistently innovative. Hornet's Nest was none of these. I feel cheated."
1,The worst novel I've ever read!,"This has to be a book written by Cornwell when she was high school. It's juvenile, absolutely preposterous, and numbingly boring. I didn't expect a Scarpetta look-alike when I picked it up but I also didn't expect to read such drivel. I was so glad that I checked it out at the library instead of spending any money on it."
1,The worst book that Patricia Cornwell could write,"I love Patricia Cornwell ideas, i love her books but Hornet's Nest is not the right evolution; i mean that is only an attemption of licterature and it is not what the author can really do. Previous books are the result of a smart mind that uses the words of a poet and spots the human fears. Hornet's Nest is only the shadow of all that."
1,Not a bit as good as the Kay Scarpetta series.,"Very disappointed. I, like one or two others I guess, picked this up quickly at an aiport just before a flight on the basis that it was another Kay Scarpetta story. I settled down to read it and oh-boy was I disappointed - please Patricia Cornwell no more like this."
1,Bad. And I do mean *bad.*,"While reading this book, I spent a great amount of time flipping to the cover to make sure it really was a Patricia Cornwell book. I enjoy her Kay Scarpetta series, but before I'd read 20 pages of this horror found myself wondering how the woman who writes them could possibly have written *this.* The characters are without exception shallow stereotypes; the dialogue is frequently painful; and there quite simply is no plot. And if there is some sort of unwritten rule about how many different points of view one novel can contain, Cornwell broke it with bells on. I forced myself to finish it by some sense of obligation, but when the last sentence was finally read it had been quite some time since I'd cared even remotely whodonit (and, as it turns out, a good thing, too). Potential reader, beware: Cornwall as you know her this most certainly is NOT."
3,A frustrating read for her fans.,"Patricia Cornwell's gifted prose and with almost make up for this book's serious flaws. As usual, she shines at deft charaterizations and crams considerable detail into the narrative. Unfortunately, she forgot to include a plot. Essentially, we walk into the middle of her characters lives at the start of the book and walk away at the end with almost everything up in the air and unresolved.I also wish that Ms. Cornwell could include at least one character in her book without some deep secret or existential angst that causes them such misery and suffering. Believe it or not, plenty of people manage to be interesting without having some tragic Greek flaw."
1,"Uncompelling, and hard to want to pick back up","Could not get into this book. I started no where and ended no where. The characters were good, but I was terribly disappointed. Kept hoping it would get better,that was that only reason I finished it. It never did. She should stick with Kay stories."
1,"If you like psychic cats, you'll like this book by Cornwell.","Cornwell introduces new characters in this detective novel. The writing style is a rat-a-tat Dragnet clip which I found extremely hard to read. The characters are total stereotypes, with most of the women ""good"" and most of the men ""bad"". You'll know what everyone's thinking in this book, even the cat. Let's just say I'm glad I took this one out of the library."
1,A real disappointment for a first time Cornwell reader.,"What began as a potentially interesting story-line turned into a gigantic disappointment. Characters were dull, the women with too many feminist overtones as if to ""prove"" something. Ending was terrible with the feeling that I wasted too much time on this book."
1,I must have missed something.,"This book was such a disappointment. What a waste of time! The characters were thin, and the plot confusing. The ending was rushed and anti-climatic. I kept reading thinking the story would pick up, but if anything it got worse as I went along. What was the deal with the cat??!!"
1,"Where, oh where is Kay Scarpetta?","The mystery was nonexistent, the killings were so deeply buried that they were almost nonexistent and I finally wondered what is the point of this book? I have enjoyed her other books, but this was pointless, Hammer was the best part of the book and her life. The ending just ended like oh well, I've written over 250 pages let's just quit, I'm bored with it all!"
1,Insipid.,"I wanted to like this book. But you really can not. It is meandering, and self-aggrandizing to the gender and age group of the author. Meaningless and a waste of time. Why did the author allow this book to get published in view of her accomplishments?"
1,A big mistake to exhume this one....,"This bears so little resemblance to Cornwell's assured, suspenseful Kay Scarpetta titles that I have to conclude it's maybe her first novel, the obligatory learning-experience make-every-mistake-in-the book one that most wise writers consign to a bottom drawer and leave there. To cash in on the Cornwell craze it seems some marketing genius decided to dig this one up and foist it on her unsuspecting fans. Bad move. Presented as juvenilia it might be sort of amusing, but passing this off as mature work can only hurt this writer's reputation."
1,This book was a great disappointment.,"If this were my first Cornwell book, I doubt I would ever buy another. As it is, I will be very cautious in the future. It reads like something she wrote long before she learned how to write."
1,A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!,"I found myself waiting for something to happen till the very LAST page. Unfortunately, it seems that another author is cranking them out so fast that they don't bother to write a REAL story. This book jumped around so much you wondered why she didn't write three books that would focus on the 3 main characters. Also, very incomplete story line. If she is not going to write something worthwhile DON'T WRITE AT ALL!!!. I bought this book strictly based on the author's name. WHAT A MISTAKE!! SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,Would not even be a good first novel,"I am sitting looking at an autographed copy of Body of Evidence, wondering if this is the same author. Having lived in Richmond I was, until now, an unabashed Cornwell fan. But, is Hornets Nest a first novel written years ago and brushed up and just now published? It is so poorly written when compared to the Scarpetta novels it should have been an embarassment to Cornwell, her publisher and her fans, of which there are many. Don't waste your time reading it"
2,This is Not a Dr. Kay Scarpetta mystery !,"With dust cover references to Dr. Kay Scarpetta, and nothing to say she wasnt in the book, I erroneously bought the book. I finished it, it was not a riviting, put everything else aside mystery like the previous Dr. Scarpetta stories. The style was different, broken up, and a little dificult to follow at first. The style was so different from the forensic novels, I'd almost venture someone else wrote this book, because even the sentence structure seemed odd, not like before. Authors have a right to change style and characters. There should have been a big warning label, ""No Dr. Scarpetta in Here"". This may be a good novel. I however was looking for a forensic thriller, this was not"
1,Disappointed,"I expected another wonderful book featuring Kay Scarpetta. Instead I found new characters in a plot that held little suspense, action or inherent interest. Is Patricia tired of Kay? Does she want to move away from her as Doyle did with Holmes? I found the book to be very disappointing and would not recommend it"
3,"Unusual stream-of-conciousness text, not like earlier books","This book is totally different from Cornwell's previous novels. It is set in a different area with different lead characters and starts off rather slowly. It develops into a good, highly detailed, police story. It does seem to be written in a rather vague, jumpy context. Some details seem to get in the way of the subject at hand and not all issues seem to be resolved. After the fact those issues are resolved but not in a way that we are aware of"
1,Poor,"Ms Cromwell could not have gotten this book published if it were her first. The characters are flat and unattractive. The story line is sketchy. The apparent mystery that begins this book is forgotten for over 100 pages. Character development is poorly done, often conflicting descriptions are made of the same person. The characters have no humanity"
1,extreme let down,"I read this book with an open mind, trying not to expect a rehash of the Scarpetta novels. I did, however, expect to find a measure of the skill and outstanding writing demonstrated in those books. I had to force myself to finish this book, and I wouldn't have bothered if the author had been anyone else. I got a little confused by all the strange and unconvincing story lines. The only mildly interesting part was when a character gets gangrene after shooting himself in the rear end. That's pretty pathetic"
1,What were the Publishers thinking?,"How could a book this bad get published in hard- back? Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors. Her publishers should have had the guts to put a stop to this embarrasment. I am amazed that she could put her name on the cover. I was embarrased trying to read this sloppy book. I tried to finish it, but I just couldn't...there are too many terrific books out there and so little time. I hope Ms. Cornwell and her publish ers wake up to public opinion on this book. It's right on the mark"
1,I wouldn't want my name on this book,I'm glad I checked this book out of the library and didn't spend my money on it. The whole affair is downright silly and I would think embarrasing to Ms. Cornwell as a writer.What a disappointment
3,Might have been one of her best.,"I found the book compelling but I agree with other reviewers who questioned authorship. Not long into the book, I wondered if PC actually wrote it; not because it was such a departure from her previous, but because the style and tone were drastically different. I don't consider it her worst effort...that distinction goes to her last novel. On a positive note, I liked the flavor and, if she pursues it, perhaps this new approach will develop into a more satisfying one from the reader's perspective. If the plot were stronger and more defined, the character treatment would have been more successful"
2,Generally Disappointing,"Perhaps the problem was that I read Southern Cross first. I thoroughly enjoyed that book, and picked up this one in hopes of gaining more insight to the characters and the general Brazil/West/Hammer story line. What a disapointment! The plot was riddled with inconsistancies, parts where you wanted to know more were cut short, others were drawn out way to long, and sometimes you were just teased without anything happening. Not a total waste of my time, but the book needed a good editor."
4,Not as good as Southern Cross,"I liked this book. I read it after Southern Cross, looking for the same characters and plot development that kept me page turning in the aforementioned sequel. I dont claim to be any sort of critic, but it does seem like the author was learning about her characters in this book, as they are a bit less refined and more ""in your face"" than in Southern Cross. Also, the plot ""backups"", in which the author jumps to a minor character in order to give credibility to an upcoming plot twist, come across more as necessary than part of the flow...they are much better in Southern Cross. Anyhoo, I liked it, and even though the end was a bit too abrupt for my taste, it made me think. I await the next Hammer/West/Brazil title eagerly, and in the meantime, I will check out her older books, coz I am having fun. :)"
1,Cliched and frustrating.,"I wish I'd read the other reviews before I picked up this book. I love the Kay Scarpetta novels. And was kind of excited to see Cornwell branch out into something new. But this book didn't work on so many levels...it's hard to know where to begin. My biggest criticism, I guess, is that there are just too many points of view here to support a cohesive, gripping storyline. Cornwell gives us a glimpse into the thoughts of every character she introduces--no matter how insignificant their role. As a result, it's nearly impossible to follow any one plot, or care about any one person. Now I'm not saying that every book must have only one POV, but most of these characters are two-dimensional, stereotypical, and do nothing to help the plot along. Nor do they provide any insight into the human condition. A very awkward and unrewarding reading experience."
2,Disappointing for hardcore Cornwell fans,"I was disappointed in this book. The story never seems to take off and grip you the way that the Scarpetta series books do. Perhaps many of us have been spoiled by the excellent plot and character development of the Scarpetta series, but - like many others - I found this book to be disappointing and slightly tedious. Still love Cornwell's writing, but if she wants to carry on with this character, the next book will need to be a major improvement."
2,Very disappointing,"The trouble with this book is that you expect Kay Scarpetta to pop up, but she doesn't. The characters aren't believable enough, the storyline doesn't hold your interest enough and you don't care if the characters live or die. This is a poor substitute to Kay Scarpetta mysteries, and the only redeeming feature about it is that it gives you something to do while you wait for the next Scarpetta book to come out. Having said that, I'd much rather wait longer for another Scarpetta book than have second-rate thrillers like these in between."
1,If you must read borrow it from the library,"I've read a few of Cornwell's other books and enjoyed them. This one, however, is awful. The characters are contrived and the plot ... well, what is the plot? I've read poorly written books before, but I put this one down at chapter five. Don't waste your time, but if you must, then please don't waste your money."
1,So far--So bad!,"As I have said elsewhere, I have thoroughly enjoyed Ms Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta mysteries but found Isle of Dogs lousy. I've now just started Southern Cross, and it looks like more of the same."
3,More about characters than story,"If you're a fan of the Kay Scarpetta series, it's hard not to be disappointed going to Hornet's Nest. The writing in the beginning of the book hit me strange, almost non-cornwell. There is very strong character development here, and while the overall story is just okay, there are parts that do shine. Enjoyable but I'd probably steer a friend toward other Cornwell books."
1,A Rating of One Star is Generous,"Much to my dismay, this was not a Scarpetta story, nor did it carry the same pizzaz and appeal. Like so many other comments written here, I agree the book was simply not worth reading and a major disappointment. Come on, Ms Cornwell, we all know you are capable of much greater things - you deserve 20 lashes with a wet noodle for this one!"
5,Joseph Wambaugh Eat your heart out,"For those of you who like uncomplicated mysteries, read some other Cornwell book. For those of you who like to see the world from several viewpoints, and have the mental capacity to keep track of all of them, this book is for you. IT IS NOT CLASSIC SCARPETTA. It is, however, hilarious, insightful, affectionate, and hopeful. In certain places, I laughed so hard I almost cried. Cornwell takes many stereotypes and stands them on their heads. I can hardly wait for the sequel!"
1,A struggle!,"The constant switching between storylines could have worked if the stories had gone somewhere. Each time I picked up the book hoping to find the trademark Patricia Cornwell style, I struggled through a few more chapters til I had to rest. I was looking forward to getting to know a new group of characters, but instead I learned more about guns & ammunition that I ever imagined I'd need to know. I'm a staunch fan so I will keep on reading her books. Maybe next time will be better."
1,This is not one of Ms. Cornwell's best. Hard to stick to.,"Being an avid fan of Ms. Cornwell, I have read all that she has in print so far. The Hornet's Nest was hard to ""get into"" and stick with unlike her other books that won't let you put it down. I, however, can not wait to see what she does next. I will always read her books for just that reason. She does need to stick with her medical examiner though."
4,"A very nice break from the usual Cornwell formula, well done",I found this book to be a great introduction to what could become some top crime novel characters. After having too much of the usual Cornwell formula this was a nice surprize. The gender nutural discriptions made me aware of my own stereotyping.
1,Hornet's Nest role reversal,"I agree with most of the other posters that this book is a waste of time. It surprises me that no one else seems to have mentioned what I thought was a fairly obvious gimmick used by Cornwall. She reversed the sexes of her protagonists. If the male characters were female and vice versa you would have a very traditional thriller format. If there had been something interesting going on this role reversal might have created some excitment, but unfortunately Hornet's Nest has zilch.I think Cornwall needs a better editor, her last few books have lacked focus and her characters have been more irritating than engaging."
3,Glad I borrowed it from the library,"I ""read"" this book on tape and now I'm wondering if I should just go get the book and read it. I know some taped books are abridged and I can't help but think that I've missed something. The ending did not do it for me either but I liked that Cornwell created some new characters. Dr. Kay was getting to be routine. I will probably ""read"" her next V. West novel. Sorry guys."
1,Disappointing -- A Real Sleeper!,"It took a two-week vacation to get a third of the way through it. I've read most of her other books and have usually finished them in two to three days. I don't believe that I'll ever finish this one. It was slow at the start, but I kept thinking that it would get better -- NOT! My biggest regret is that I purchased it, instead of checking it out of the library! I hope this is not the start of a writing slump, as I really do enjoy her work!"
1,If I couldv'e rated this book a 0 I would have,I cannot believe how horrible this book was. I kept waiting for it to get better and it only got worse. I wouldn't waste my money on this-I wouldn't even take it if someone gave it to me for free! I have always enjoyed Patricia's books in the past and she needs to stick to Kay Scarpetta!!! The Dr. Scarpetta books I don't want to put down-Hornet's Nest I didn't even want to pick up! The only reason this book was on the best seller's list was because of Patricia Cornwells past performances-not because this was a great book!
1,Use it to start a fire!,"This was my first -- and last -- Patricia Cornwell book. I kept reading it thinking she would develop the characters further, but nothing ever happens. Even the motives of the killer aren't delved into. This could probably be an excellent book with some further character and plot development, but in my opinion she needed to fulfill her book contract and chose to do it with this piece of junk. Not worth the paper it's written on. Too bad, too, because the *potential* is there for an excellent story. Don't waste your money."
2,The ending smelled like last weeks dirty diapers!!!,Give me Dr. Kay. I like not having any fingernails. Didn't sleep with a ball bat after I read this one.
1,Bewilderingly stupid,"I had my hopes up for this book, just BECAUSE Kay Scarpetta wasn't in it. I've always thought that the Scarpetta series is vastly overrated. But was I surprised! This book was infinitely worse than any of the others I've read. For a while I thought it must be a satire, but in the end, I had to face that it's just plain bad, with cardboard characters and a totally unbelievable plot. The worst part is that I was given this book for my birthday by a very dear friend, and I'm desperate to come up with something kind to say about it :-/"
1,A plotless and pointles novel.,"The book has no real plot; the serial killings are secondary to descriptions of two rather unbeliveable female police officials and one immature male reporter (also fantastically ""beautiful"")! Lacks interest."
1,does not live up to previous Cornwell works,"Hornet's Nest is lacking a strong story line although the 2 female characters are interesting. Unlike previous Scarpetta adventures, this has absolutely no story line or suspense, merely confusion and a ""what is the point of this"" feeling."
2,Awful! Half way through it & don't know why I keep reading,"Just terrible! The book needs a coroner! Should never have been published and if you have not yet read it, don't bother. Almost seems as though someone other than Patricia Cornwell wrote it for her. Just not her quality."
3,why is everyone comparing it to the scarpetta books?,I didn`t like this book much. It was average. Nearly all the reviewers on this page compare it to the scarpetta series.Why? Why don`t you just take it on face value?
1,Don't waste your time/money,"Patricia Cornwell seems to have joined the legion of book a year authors who started writing excellent, intriguing books and who wind up cranking out one a year regardless of content. I have enjoyed her books in the past but wasted time I'll never get back on this one. Bring back Kay Scarpetta a proven winner"
1,Did she really write this?,I was very disappointed with the book. No character that wasn't a clique. Not up to her usual standard at all. Pretty awful.
1,Therapy for Patricia?,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. Patricia was obviously using this book to reflect what was going on in her life at the time of the writing. She was so into showing that people are not always what they seem, and that different people may have differing opinions on another person. There was no plot to speak of, just pages upon pages of character development. There was no real end to the story, either, it felt like falling off a cliff, without the actual fall. One minute you're there, the next...I will definately read her next book, because Patricia Cornwell has shown me time and time again what a great author she is. However, if there is no Dr. Kay, I doubt I will read it (unless it's from the library and I'm desperate)."
1,Save your money!!!,"Hornets Nest is the second book I purchased by Patricia Cornweel and I just don't get her popularity. This book, like the other I tried to read was left on the airplane . Didn't get past 6 chapters in either one without yawning. At least I was able to sleep on the plane."
3,By page 100 I started to laugh: Tom Sharpe is better.,"Is Hornet's Nest a send up, like Sargent Beef who goes about with his ""writer"" as some writers went about with their ""detective""? Half way through the ""where to keep the banana"" episode I started to laugh, and laughed many more times the rest of the way through. First I thought Cornwell couldn't do a three-dimensional male character;now I think this cardboard cut-out of an innocent, Brazil, is a send up in the wonderful Tom Sharpe tradition of Wilt. The accumulating misunderstandings of police actions are bemusing to amusing, but not up to my expectations for Cornwell."
1,Unfocused panoply of anti-heroes fail to solve mystery,"What's happened to Patricia Cornwell? Her brilliant observations are wasted here in confetti like bursts about random characters who pop up and never appear again. The novel lacks plot structure and anyone with whom to identify - except perhaps for the reverently described but unidimensional female police chief, Hammer - and she is not really involved in solving the main mystery - a series of murders which is set up in the beginning - and then abandoned for pages and pages of wanderings. I kept with it, hoping for a miracle. Wish I hadn't. Bring back Scarpetta - and a plot - please!"
1,Hornet's Nest - not so hot,"I've read almost everything Patricia Cornwall has written, and I must say that Hornet's Nest was a big letdown. I can appreciate her moving away from the Kay Scarpetta character, but this book just didn't fly with me. They main story line was good, but the resolution to the crime was weak at best. I felt that there were too many issues jammed together to provide good thriller reading. The cat's pseudo-psychic abilities proved to be a rather lame attempt at bringing closure to the various issues which had popped up in the story. Immediately upon finishing the book, I wanted to send Patricia an e-mail - I felt that her editor and any manuscript readers working for her had let her down in allowing this book to fly as-is. A major re-write would be a benefit."
1,Fails the Test,"An embarrassment for all concerned. The most intriguing aspect of the book was trying to figure out if the book was simply ""payback"" for events that were occurring in the author's private life. The idolized female police captain (whose wardrobe seems to have been the largest factor commanding respect and devotion from her staff) suffers a petty, overweight husband lacking any redeeming qualities. Oh, and he manages to contract flesh-eating disease on his butt. This was the high-point. Fascinating in the way a car crash is riveting. Truly awful"
1,A world-class disaster!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS BOOK. The above reviews were too kind to this book! I put down the book after 10 pages and was prepared to discard it. And then I thought, the writer couldn't be this bad. WAS I WRONG! She is not going to get me next time. It will be 0 degrees in Los Angeles before I read another book written by this author.What can we sufferers do? Spread the word what a stinker this is. I would like to file a class action suit on behalf of all the readers who thought this was a ""suitable"" book - it wasn't suitable for the purpose sold - enjoyment. I'm furious to have wasted my time.Gerald Lipsky (onetoten@westworld.com)"
3,"We're not in Richmond anymore, Toto!",Its not Kay Scarpetta and its not exactly a mystery-not a good one anyway. Cornwell uses this book as a soapbox for feminist and lesbian issues. I have no arguement with her raising such issues but I do object to having to pay eighteen dollars to hear them when I expected Kay Scarpetta!I want Kay!!
2,Very Poor,"What a tremendous disappointment. There was no pleasure in this read. Bad dialogue dominated the book. It is hard to believe this came from the pen of the well known novelist that had just given us Body of Evidence. Perhaps the authors own involvement in real life drama distracted her from the purpose of her efforts, that is, fine drama and suspense. The media critics are correct on this one. You will be very disappointed and angry at the author for wasting your time"
1,I only struggled through the first ten pages.,I have read and enjoyed every other book of Cornwell's. I can't believe she wrote this drivel or that any editor would publish such an amatuerish piece of writing. It reads like a caricature of a 1950s detective novel. I kept waiting for Dirk Manly to appear
2,"Interesting character development, slow plot, weak ending",Why did the cat have to be involved? That aspect of the storyline weakened the whole novel. It destroyed my faith in Patricia Cornwall as a writer dedicated to quality
2,Double the Disappointment,"As a PC fan and a native North Carolinian, I looked forward to this latest book with great anticipation. I should have saved my money. Unlike some other reviewers, I was not upset that Scarpetta was not the major character. It was an excellent opportunity to develop a new character, another woman in a leadership position. This opportunity,however, was wasted. The storyline was convoluted and the timeline was illogical. The characters were not fully developed and made it impossible to make any type of connection with them. The story skipped back and forth so much I found myself constantly turning back to earlier chapters to try to figure out what was going on. The references to major landmarks in Charlotte were trivial and trite; as if she picked up a AAA guide and quoted it. I finally decided that after paying $20 for the hardback it was PC's job to explain the story and gave up"
1,Unbeleivable that Patricia Cornwell wrote this terrible book,"As a faithful Patricia Cornwell reader I looked forward to this author's unique story telling capablilities in Hornet's Nest. I knew going into the book that this was not a Kay Scarpetta novel, but I looked forward to Cornwell's ability to develop new characters in a different environment. This book was a total disappointment, from plot to character development. It was hard to figure out what exactly the story was or what the point of the book was. I, for one do not believe Patricia Cornwell wrote this book! If she did, she temporarily lost her unique talent for auhoring some of the best novels written by a contemporary female author."

1,awful,"Unfortunately, my review is only about the first 60 pages. I couldn't read any further--it was too awful. The plot didn't seem too bad but the quality of writing was what made me throw the book down. I couldn't take it any more. The sentences were so amateurish--they were long, the subject changed mid-sentence, many details just seemed to have been thrown in for good measure. It was just torture for me to read. It was as if Cornwell sat down at the PC and just wrote, as final copy, the story, with no rewrites. Where was her editor?"
1,I kept waiting for it to get better.,I couldn't wait to purchase another Kay Scarpetta adventure. Surprised was I when she was no where to be read. I slugged through it but was very disappointed. Please go back to Kay's adventures.
1,Worst book I ever read!!,This is the worst book I have ever read. Couldn't keep my attention as it was going every where and not pulling it together. Wasn't making any sense at all.
3,Not the usual cornwell that we are accustomed to seeing,"I found this book to be slow starting, although I am a faithful follower of all of Cornwells ""Scarpetta"" novels, i found this to be off to a slow start. Cornwell did a wonderful job of explaining her charachters although there was a little left to be desired with the explanation of this ""criminals mind"". Give it a try, we can't expect all of them to be about ""Scarpetta and Lucy""."
1,YUK! Couldn't Even Finish It!!!,"This book is so disappointing. I had very much enjoyed several of the Kay Scarpetta novels and was a bit dubious that this book didn't feature her, but gave it a try anyway. It is simply awful. Halfway through I decided it was a big waste of time -- and judging by the other reviews here, it was a good decision."
1,A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR CORNWELL! THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE!!,"I've read almost all of Cornwell's books, and this is by far, the worst book she has ever written. What happened to Scarpetta? This was one of the most boring books that I have ever read. Don't even bother to read it!"
1,One Of The Worst Books Ever,"I've read almost every one of Patricia Cornwall's books and this book is simply awful. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it (and I always finish a book). She should stick with the Kay Scarpetta novels. Not that going off series is a bad thing, but this book just didn't engage me at all. If you're a Kay Scarpetta fan, don't read this book. You'll be disappointed."
3,Kay Scarpetta it ain't... or is it?,"Even though Cornwell's bread and butter isn't present in fact in this book, the gutsy Chief and Assistant Chief of the Charlotte Police Department are cut from the same mold. If you like Kay, you'll like West and Hammer. Twisted serial killers, strange personal relationships, and typical Cornwell plot devices make this a good read, if a shallow one.The cassette version (abridged) leaves a little of the continuity out, but even there the color comes through."
3,Kind of an Odd Book,"While this was an enjoyable read (a most important criteria for me), I finished the book and wanted to say: ""Whatever""! The characters were interesting, but mostly unbelievable in most ways. Also, the plot was unusual - for instance, a crime that no one knows about is solved as the perpetrator of the unknown crime is murdered as part of a set of serial killings. I guess that could happen.Anyway, I did find myself rooting for Andy and West to get together, even though they had a love/hate relationship that did not bode well for their future."
1,My favorite author has completely bombed out.,"Unlike Ms Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels which are real page turners, filled with emotion,Hornet's Nest leaves me lost. I have tried three times to read this book and simply can not follow her shallow story line which switches between characters paragraph by paragraph. Purchase this one for any price and ""You Lost""."
1,One of the most boring books I've ever read,"Patricia Cornwell's books about Kay Scarpetta are usually very interesting and entertaining.I had great expectations when I started to read this book. This one is just boring. It's a lousy police novel,is not the least exciting, has no interesting characters. Add to this a complete failure to tell anything interesting about women-officers in a man's world. The only thing in this book that makes me happy is that I borrowed it in my local library so I didn't have to buy it.Anyhow, one star is a generous mark!"
2,"you win some, you lose some","I love all of Patricia Cornwell's books -- which means all of the Kay Scarpetta series. This one, though, was just flat. It was missing a plot, snappy dialogue, etc. It really reminded me of a first effort from some kid starting out as a novelist. I don't think Cornwell is a bad writer -- on the contrary, I think she's excellent -- but this book was most definitely NOT one of her best efforts. Try again, Patricia."
5,Mysteries of Sucessful Project Management Revealed!,"In Modern Project Management, Dr. Howes dispels the common misconception that ""scheduling"" alone delivers effective project management. This book bridges the gap left by schedule-oriented software packages by guiding the user to first employ critical, upfront thinking that will yield effective, efficient project planning. Modern Project is a must read for new project managers and seasoned veterans. Its straightforward philosophy and innovative tools will consistently yield predictable and repeatable results regardless of the project at hand. The accompanying project management system found on the enclosed CD is a valuable complement to the Microsoft Project scheduling tool. It includes an automated interface to Microsoft Project that allows one to transfer the Microsoft scheduling dates into the Modern Project software."
5,A really modern treatment of project management,"This book focuses on modern project management concepts and techniques, but covers the standard stuff like what you will find in the PMI PMBOK. The project management system that comes on the CD with the book contains tools you won't find even in expensive PM systems. There are at least a couple dozen tools on the CD and an example project you can use to try the tools out on."
5,"Finally, someone who understands!","Whereas most so-called project management books do not deal with project management at all, and those that do rely on intuition and some experience, Dr Howes bases his method and supporting tools on vast experience and mathematics. This is crucial for those that need to manage complex projects, because now, finally, there is a solid and scientific basis for making decisions. Even though the underlying mathematics may be unpleasant reading for some, the technique can be understood and the tools cen be used without deep mathematical knowledge; this is quite an achievement! A must for anyone involved in project management!"
5,perfect for the age 9-14 age group,I had gotten this for my kids before; the cd had gotten destroyed and they asked(often)for another--that says alot to me.
1,Stupid!!!!,"A barbie cd???? How pathetic!!!! Mattel, what were you thinking???? That is the most stupidest thing i have ever heard of!!!!!!!!!! Mattel u sell like the best barbies and now u have to come up wth this junk!?!? wut is this????"
1,Retarded cd,"this is a retarded, stupid, and hideous cd. don't waste ur money unless you like to cover your ears a lot. the little kids in the backround ruined the whole cd. THEY CAN'T SING! these songs were so forged! don't waste $14.99! what was mattel thinking?! it would better if you just bought all of the real cd's that were taken to put on this crappy cd. I didn't hear barbie in this cd either. wuts the point in that! the barbie on the cover is a bad role model. she scares me! she wears provocotive clothing! do u really want your kids to be like that! do you really want to hurt your kids ears at such a young age? kids don't even listen to these songs! they listen to barnie! when you think of barbie, you think ages 4-8. but do u really want your kids listening to lyrics like ""shake it like a poloroid picture"" and other mature lyrics?! bottom line...............DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! DO IT FOR THE HEALTH OF YOUR KIDS!"
4,Good Compilation Album,This complation cd is good. I really like the clearity of the songs but at times they seem to polished. Overall a good album.
5,"Sort Of A ""Greatest Hits"" To That Date","If you're a die hard KISS fan, you'll love this CD. It has studio versions of their hottest music to 1978, plus a 1978 version of ""Strutter"", which really doesn't sound that different from the other versions til the end of the song. Lots of good METAL on this CD except of course for the tear jerking ""Beth"" and the rough, but, slow, ""Hard Luck Woman"". ... I suppose one of the pluses of this album is the fact that you get to hear all the guys sing. Ace Gene Paul and Peter. Now, if you really want to hear these guys ""Get Off"", Please let me suggest, Alive I , Alive II, Alive III, and Alive IV. The cover is really cool and is a work of art in itself. ..."
2,"Its supposed to be greatest hits, not greatest remixes!","I was told Kiss was one of the definitive heavy metal bands, and that is true. But word to the wise, don't start off your Kiss collection with this album, it full of remixes that sound too discolike, too soft. The reason I bought this album was because it looked too cool, I mean who wouldn't buy and album with a completely platinum design. The first thing I thought when I bought this was, is this Kiss, one of the heaviest bands in history? If my friend didn't suggest I buy Alive, I would've never knew what true Kiss sounds like. Alot of people actually suggested this album, but a person should start with the normal version of a song, then listen to the remix. If you want to start a Kiss collection, buy Alive, not this."
2,Think this over.,"I have always had a problem with this album. Shout It Out Loud should be on here instead of Do You Love Me, Christine Sixteen should be on here instead of Cold Gin, and Shock Me or Plaster Caster should be on here instead of She. Also why is there no material from the band best album, ALIVE? Also when Neil Bogart asked them to re-record -Disco-Strutter, they ruined a classic song. Many of they remixes suck like Calling Dr. Love or Firehouse. This and many others make you ask yourself if you want this or you are getting it to complete the collection."
5,"Kiss me once, Kiss me twice","Some of the best Kiss songs from over a decade, as the name suggests, pure Platinum.The guitar riffs take me back to my youth, I love it!"
3,Great compilation but i dont like remixes.,"This is the very first best of compilation from Kiss.And i must say its probably my least played album.While the song tracks are great i just dont like remixes i prefur the originals.Why would you want a better version of ""Strutter"" when the first one was so good.I have never played any of Kiss's compilations much.Id rather play the Alive cd's.And when i hear alternate versions it just annoys me.Now before i upset some die hard fans, dont be mistaken,im a Kiss crazy,and i love all the songs here.Its just that once you have the songs why do you need them in a compilation?And kiss have released so many these days ive lost track.But if you dont have the earlier albums you wont be disappointed with the songs here."
2,Yeah its alright,"Not bad the only hot songs here are100,000 yearsStrutterGod of thunderDeuceSheCalling Dr loveThe rest of the album is average."
4,"superb third,sloppy eighth!","beethoven's third symphony by Bruno Walter and The Columbia Symphony Orchestra is among the very best that i have heard.Walter infuses a sense of ""adventure into the unknown"",the strings play with restrained elegance,the horns are majestic and the woodwinds toss the phrases back and forth.the pacing is unhurried and yet there is high drama!From here till the very end YOU ARE FIXED!truly a heroic performance.Walter's eighth is a disappointment where the orchestra plods where the tension has to build up!here my favourite is George Szell and the cleveland orchestra -a stupendous performance!"
3,One expected Walter's Beethoven to hold up better,"The lovable Bruno Walter was marketed with a halo around him in his old age. This Eroica from 1959 and Sym. #8 from the year before could be heard as spiritual and wise, I suppose. But I hear fairly sluggish readings by a goodish orchestra in reasonable sound for that era. Walter was never a technician, and one doesn't go to his recordings expecting virtuosity. At his best in old age he was soft-grained but alert, with a fund of musical experience that carried through the sloppy execution.That Walter isn't on display here. The Eroica is moderately slow, with occasional romantic shaping (as in the crooning horms as they begin the trio of the Scherzo) but also long stretches of middle-of-the-road mellow playing. The Eighth is the slowest version of any I own, particularly in the Scherzo, and even though it makes no heroic demands, Walter seems content to saunter through it. One expected more, frankly."
3,"A decent enough reference, but not recommended for beginners","This book has a lot of reference info on Bash, Perl, and Tcl/Tk commands and options, especially lots of tables. However, I wouldn't recommend it for beginners to programming in these languages, since his explanations of many topics is rather turgid and unclear. In addition, the number of typos and just plain errors is unacceptably high for a book that puports to show beginners how to do shell programming. Overall, a good book for the reference shelf, but only for those who already have some knowledge of this kind of programming."
2,sh != bash && linux != unix,"The Bourne Again Shell isn't even standard on unix systems and the constant mention of linux as something synonomous is just pathetic. I'm sorry I ever got this book. Get UNIX Power Tools instead. It costs a few bucks more, but this book is pathetic. If you want to learn to use shell scripts on multiple platforms, this isn't the book. It's strongly GNU/Linux orientated, but that won't help you in the real world with unix OS's"
5,One of the Best!,"What can you say about the Love Gun CD. Definitely one of KISS' best ones. The title song, Love Gun, has such an extreme beat, and the others are great too."
5,BUY! KISS AT THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST!,"I Stole Your Love, Christeen Sixteen, Shock Me, Love Gun, Plaster Caster. There isn't a bad note on the entire album! My all-time favorite, to me it reigns over Destroyer, KISS, Dressed To Kill, Alive!, and Rock N Roll Over! Also KISS does a wicked version of ""Then He Kissed Me"" turning it into ""Then She Kissed Me"". The last great KISS album is an ""ABSOLUTE"" Must Have! Buy!"
3,This is okay.,"It's not a GREAT album, but it does have some servicable tunes. ""Christine Sixteen,"" is perverted but has a neat piano, funky sort of thing going on. ""Plaster Caster"" is rocking little ditty, as is Peter Criss's ""Hooligan,"" which has some funny lyrics. ""Love Gun"" is pre-'80's metal. BLAH! ""Shock Me"" is stupid but has an excellent guitar solo and some good drumming. It's okay overall."
3,End of an era,"While I can appreciate Kiss's return to their hard rock roots, this is not a steady effort. Rock N Roll Over, which preceded this album, is far superior. Kiss made the decision to return to making basic hard rock music in 1976 after the dissapointing and confusing ""Destroyer"". ""Rock N Roll Over"" was a success. It had the quality songs similar to the first three albums but it had better production quality. Kiss tried to continue the formula with Love Gun but with a few notable exceptions, the songs just weren't there.Best tracks: ""Plaster Caster"", ""I Stole Your Love"", ""Love Gun"""
4,"""You pulled the trigger of my.....Love Gun""","I can still remember bringing this album to art class back in grade school much to the disgust of most of the girls. Needless to say it was never played again but at least for one class period everyone had to listen to KISS! Love Gun has a couple of my all time favorite Kiss songs, Love Gun (great vocals, great guitar)and Plaster Caster (simple song with cool vocals by Gene). Other klassics are Almost Human (cool lyrics), I Stole Your Love, and Christine Sixteen (solo by Eddie Van Halen I believe). Ace's Shock Me and Peter's Hooligan are good as is the cover of Then She Kissed Me. The two songs I could do without are Tomorrow & Tonight (rehash) and Got Love For Sale (weak and not catchy at all). Unfortunately the cd does not have the original cardboard ""Love Gun"" but it does contain some fine good-time rock!"
4,ANOTHER HIT FOR THE NEW FAB FOUR,"Kiss' 1977 effort is well worth a first listen, and a second, and a third...actually, I have long since worn out my copies on cassette and vinyl. The album is not quite up to the standard they set with 'Destroyer', but then again, every band has one album that stands out as their best. I'd have to say that this is Kiss' second best, with the standout cuts 'I Stole Your Love', 'Love Gun', and 'Christine Sixteen', as well the song that introduced the world to Ace Frehley's voice: 'Shock Me'. If you are a rock fan (not necessarily a KISS fan, then this is one you should add to your collection as a reminder of the days when rock and roll was fun!"
4,Love Gun,"Kiss make light, airy and fun music. They have their share of cheese as well, but then they wouldn't be Kiss without it. Their 70s music has a certain charm or character to it. I can see why there are fans that stick by the Ace years. Generally speaking their songs tend to be catchy, not overly complicated. Not being a huge fan, I'll take a stab at this, Ace Frehley(guitarist) was on the albums Kiss-Dynasty. Drummer, Peter Criss, left the band as well, was it around Dynasty too? So, this has the original line up in it. After Dynasty they went in a more Glam direction. I've only heard songs Lick it Up and Heaven's on Fire. One thing's for sure, they found a way to seperate themselves from the rest of the pack, especially visually."
3,filler,"This album is ok, but was filled with filler material such as Then she...., Hooligan, Got love for sale and tomorrow and tonight. Thats 40% filler. That along with really weak production (probably rushed at the time) equalls 60% ok review.. aka 3 stars... Not one of their better albums."
2,Juvenile,"Just for kicks, I went out last week and bought this CD. It was one of my favorites from my youth.I'm now 38 and realize that this music is really for kids. Stupid lyrics and tunes that aren't all that memorable. ""Christine Sixteen"" is a good song, as is ""Got Love For Sale.""Every really listen to the words on ""Love Gun?"" Geez, they sound like they were written on a hotel restaurant napkin in 10 minutes."
2,Don't Let The Legend Fool You,"Despite spawning one of the most famous tours of all time, ""Love Gun"" is actually a very weak link in KISS's chain. Aside from two classics, ""Love Gun"" and ""I Stole Your Love,"" most of this record is total throw-away filler. Songs like ""Hooligan,"" and ""Got Love For Sale"" prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that KISS was making too many records too quickly at this point in their career. Even Ace's singing debut, the comical ""Shock Me"" is a song given more reverence than it ever deserved. Ace would write much better songs on the ""Dynasty"" and ""Unmasked"" albums.And for a band on top of the world at this point, the recording quality of ""Love Gun"" is abysmal. There's no bass worth mentioning, the guitars are soft and tinny and everything sounds like it's at the back of a wind tunnel.Slight mention should go to Gene's somewhat kinky ""Almost Human"" but people would be better off thinking of ""Love Gun"" the song than they would remembering ""Love Gun"" the album."
4,Not Five Stars But Real Close,"I like it! The beginning of SuperKISS! The album cover is really cool and done by the same guy who did Destroyer. I Stole Your Love, Love Gun, Plaster Caster, Hooligan, Christine Sixteen, Shock Me are real highlights and even Gene's two obscure songs Got Love For Sale and Almost Human are cool and kind of a stretch for the band, Almost Human especially, something you might hear on Destroyer. I even like their cover of Then She Kissed Me, not sure it was a necessary edition but it came out cool. Love Gun could have been a double album had they used the studio tracks from side 4 of Alive II and maybe threw in one or two other cool songs. Tomorrow and Tonight is the weakest song on the album but it's not that bad. I'm not sure when they were written but All American Man or Rocking In The USA would have been better choices. Overall, a great album with more solid production by Eddie Kramer and great performances by the band."
4,It Rocks,I liked this album from the time I first heard it in the 2nd grade.Still gives me the same feeling as it did way back then.We need more bands like Kiss!!
2,I expected better. . . .,"Disappointment abounds - I'm used to the fiery wit of Tristan as in On Our Backs. In this book, she is too calmed down, too tame, too something. The book definitely runs parallel with the adage of ""not judging a book by it's cover"" - anyone would be lured in by the pink cover and Ms. Taormino's come-hither stare-down. But alas, the naughty is not so naughty - it's nothing I haven't seen/heard before. It would be a great manual for a couple/single whose tastes run more toward the vanilla side, but I don't fall into this category and I found nothing here that couldn't be found in an issue of Cosmopolitan or Jane. Better luck next time."
1,Forget it!,This book is a total waste of money. I found nothing of value in this book. It is thick because it contains copies of various forms for each state so you can use them as guides in making your own POA. Best to spend 100 bucks and get a lawyer!
3,Doesn't hold my DSLR still.,"I thought it would work for my DSLR with 18-200 zoom lens, but it didn't. Keeping it for my next smaller camera someday."
5,tripod,"I thought this tripod was going to be great but I was wrong, It does not have full range of motion makes the pictures or video have a angle on them, I put this on my tree climber which has square tubeing it sits nicely on there because of the design but with that said I bought a gorilla tripod does just what it should, dont waste your time on this one!"
1,For lightweight point n shoot cameras only.,"Marginal for a Canon Rebel TxI series. Forget it for anything more like a 60d, or 7d. Safest for lightweight point and shoot cameras only. Good idea. Just too flimsy. Waste of money otherwise."
5,Cool and useful tripod,"This is a great little tripod - I even strapped it to my bicycle handlebars and took a video of a short ride through the neighborhood. If you have a small digital camera, get this tripod - a perfect and inexpensive accessory."
5,Essential accessory,"I've carried one of these in my camera bag for many years and found it to be very handy. The velcro strap is indeed very useful, and you may be surprised how often you'll think of a way to use it. But I seem to have lost it, and after using one of little tripods with flexible legs for a few months, I'm here to get another Ultrapod -- I just don't like being without it."
5,Very good,"Still haven't had the chance to use it a lot but so far, this tripod seems to be exactly what I needed - lightweight and small. The designers have obviously put a lot of thought into it and the result is good functionality at a reasonable price."
5,Versatile tool for small cameras,"I purchased this on a whim while at a camera store recently and I LOVE this product. I put it on my small point and shoot camera and use it as a handle when I'm not using it as a tripod. It fits perfectly in my pocket and is always handy.However, DO NOT pay $40 for this. I paid $12 for it in a store including tax!"
5,Perfect for compact cameras,"I've used the gorilla pod, and it has its merits but this I think is better 95% of the time. Very sturdy, I use it on my Olympus XZ-2; I think it would easily hold something as large as a NEX-5N or Canon G12 with no issues. Look at the bigger one for DSLR use. The best thing about it is it fits easily in a rear jean pocket or jacket, deploys quickly, and once set is very stable. Great for group or long exposure shots. For super sharp landscape or architecture shots this works well too; obviously won't replace a full sized tripod, but its great because you can always carry it with you. Price is right too."
5,My son loves it,I bought this product for my son because he does stop animation. He loves this tripod. He can set it up to stand or attach it to something to make it sit higher. It is really helpful for him to do different angle shots.
4,NICE,"I don't ever read books with Christian themes; they tend to get a bit preachy for this non-Christian. However, the Christianity of Samson's characters is so skillfully interwoven with their personalities that it's easy to ""forgive"" the preaching.I appreciate faith, and the fact that her characters are so deeply flawed and not harp playing angels makes their faith and application of that faith a very lovely read.It's nice to read about people overcoming their hamartia, it lends such hope to the rest of us. What Samson portrayed was a God who uses all things to his own ends, the fire, the lies, all of it, and that Romans 8:28 is a universal truth.Aside from Lark making me want to slap her for being so backwards (she made me nervous and I wondered how she could be such a good Christian if she didn't even trust her God to take care of her when she left the house.)...LOL I truly enjoyed this book and will buy it for my mother who loves books with Christian themes."
1,"Good title , but not for this book","I read this book and finished it and then asked myself why. Should have discarded it after the first 100 pages (that is usually my rule). I guess the mystery kept me going, but it was definitely a young adult book ."
2,Never finished it,"I've completed about a dozen self-help programs in my life and have become a better person for it. However, I bought this course years ago and could never get past half way. I can't really put my finger on it but I've tried a few time w/out success.ken"
1,The orientation of colors is wrong!,Black should be top and green is bottom. The orientation of the flag shown is reveresed.
5,and ya don't quit... cameo is the ultimate (chapter II),"two days ago, i received my copy, and it once more proves that this band knows how to make you move and more importantly, feel good. enviable versatility and high-level performance add further to the enjoyment -- don't be so cool, in the night, hangin' downtown, it's serious, and alligator woman are the highlights of an extremely entertaining ride on the funky side. a sure shot, no doubt. double your pleasure by buying the the first best of volume, too. (no, i'm *not* paid for hyping them -- they *are* the best, that's all)."
4,"THE ONLY CAMEO CD WITH ""YOUR LOVE TAKES ME OUT""","Out of all the cds they put out by Cameo, this is the only cd that this song is available. I could not find it no where else. It has that I just want to be & shake your pants flavor that was on the Feel Me lp."
5,a definite MUST!,This is the most comprehensive book I have seen to date in my 9 years of experience for the neonatal brain and spine.It has prenatal and neonatal information and a great set of images that is a valuable tool for any ultrasound department that does neonatal heads.A definite MUST for registry preparation.
1,Unsincere and Unoriginal,"""Lonely"" by Bobby Vinton makes me cry each time I listen to it. But Akon's sampled version? A complete hip-hop mess. I can't stand this song and I switch the station every time it comes on the radio. I don't want Alvin and the Chipmunk's singing to me. Then again Akon can't sing himself."
3,Upset stomach...,"I decided to take these in addition to my prenatal vitamin, and have been taking them for a couple weeks now. I try to eat before taking them, but have made many trips to the bathroom afterwards. Can't seem to keep them down. I'm 8 months pregnant. Also noticed the ""fishy"" taste in my mouth, which some people claim they haven't noticed. I will be trying another fish oil supplement once this bottle is finished."
3,Fishy,"I was looking for an affordable DHA supplement with no fishy aftertaste. I prefer the plant-based DHA supplements because they're never fishy, but I decided to give this one a shot based on its reviews.Unfortunately, this product did not deliver. I'm sure they're great for my developing baby, but they do cause nasty fish burps. If I take one in the middle of a meal--eat a little, then take the capsule, then eat some more--this effect is lessened and sometimes doesn't even occur. But if I take them before or after, I get the fish burps. The taste is really awful, like stale salmon.I'll finish this bottle now that I've learned how to reduce the yucky effect, but I won't buy them again. I'll go back toEnfamil Expecta Lipil, Softgels, 30 softgels (Pack of 2), which are plant based and don't give me nasty burps no matter how I take them."
4,Happy,"I'm happy with this product. I used Expecta Lipil with my last pregnancy and my daughter is super, super smart and ahead of the game, so I know taking a supplement didn't hurt anything! The reason I chose Mommy's Bliss this time is because it is actual fish oil, not a more artificial source of DHA. The soft gels are a little tougher to swallow and the first time I opened the bottle, I could smell fish. Extra yucky to smell when you are pregnant. But I haven't caught a whiff of a fish smell since the initial package opening and I am SUPER sensitive to that in general. I hate fish. But otherwise, I've been happy with product. :) Would have been a 5 if it was easier for me to swallow and I hadn't smelt the fishy smell at all. ;)"
4,Pretty Good Some Flaws,"This is a good supplement if you are taking a prenatal that doesn't already contain Omega-3 DHA. I like that it is from a natural, safe source of fish oil. What I don't love is the shape of the pills. They are very round and sometimes get caught in my throat. I wish they were flatter, softer and longer. Also, it does sometimes leave a slight fishy aftertaste but not big deal."
5,One of their Best!,"Hands down, one of their best records. How can you not like these ferocious riffs, pounding drums and Ace's fretwork? The songwriting was good here as well. ""Mr. Speed"" ""I Want You"" and ""Makin' Love"" are the best of any Paul songs in the 70s. ""Dr. Love"" ""Ladies Room"" and ""Love'em and Leave'em"" are Gene's gems from the disc, and you gotta love Peter's ""Baby Driver"" and ""Hard Luck Woman"" vocals. The only way this record could have been any better is if they had Ace sing a song. The sound goes back to the ""Dressed to Kill"" sound after the intricately produced ""Destroyer"" masterpiece. But it rocks all the harder because I think Kiss enjoyed working with Eddie Kramer...and it shows on this album."
5,Back to Basics,What can I say other than this album rocks. It has a great mixture of rocking tunes as well as the occasional ballad. Together they make an awsome combination.
3,The lost album?,"Almost every band seem to have a so called ""lost album"" and this one might be Kiss lost album.""Rock and roll over"" is a good rock record in general and with hindsight one of Kiss better. This one seem to over looked since it came after ""Destroyer"" and before ""Love gun"".If you're not familiar with Kiss music, this album is as a good start as any other. You get the hard rocking Kiss in songs like ""I want you"" and ""Makin' love"", the soft Kiss in ""Hard luck woman"". But more, you get to hear rare good tunes like ""Mr. speed"" and ""Baby driver"""
3,Krossroads,"This is the album where KISS lost their nerve. They took the easy way out and opted for comic book stardom (and you can't really blame them, I guess) rather than sticking to their guns and building on the real progress they had made over the previous couple of years. Coming hot on the heels of the daring and expansive ""Destroyer"", ""Rock and Roll Over"" is a real regression -- 10 painfully simple (yet still enjoyable) made-to-order songs for mass consumption by their ever-increasing fan base. No one complained, of course, and this album was a worldwide mega-smash, but in retrospect it's easy to see that this was where the band's artistic sensibilities were forever compromised. Oh well -- Icons tend to be better compensated than Artists, anyway. Just ask Kafka. Or Hulk Hogan...."
3,"Decent, but Far Too Tame","A good deal of this album from KISS is pretty meek. Some of the songs rock a bit harder, but it's pretty subdued for hard rock."
4,Darren d.,ROCK AND ROLL OVER Is a good cd .hey you got song`s like DR.LOVE MR. SPEED. AND THE LIST GO`S ON. IF YOU ARE kiss fan this one is for you!!.THE PRICE`S FOR THIS CD IS THE BEST.so rock and roll over and over whith this cd. thank you.
5,Masterpiece,"Everyone should have a copy of Rock And Roll Over in their collection if you ask me. So many great songs, such great performances. This is one of the absolute best KISS albums ever made. Quintessential.Put it on and press repeat."
5,Phil Pedroza hates this but it's great,"I love this CD. Hard edge rock reminding me of the days when music was important. Yea, image was a big part of Kiss but their music was solid in the 70s. After that they exchanged the makeup for jungle tights and the fun was gone. These tunes continue their hard rock Beatlesque harmony meets the Who and Hendrix. I Want You is terrific, Baby driver is cool and Dr. Love is awesome. Boy I miss the 70s. Pedroloser hates this CD...WHYOWHYOWHY????"
5,Destroyer??,"Destroyer this, Destroyer that...it is a good album. Yes 'Beth' was on that album and there was success with it, but their best album is 'Rock and Roll Over'! This album ROCKS! I feel you could play this whole album at a concert and fans would love itl. 'Take Me'!!"
3,A good album.,"Rock and Roll Over is a good album from Kiss and is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction. There is a total of ten tracks, and the musicianship, songwriting, and production are also good. All of the guys do an energetic job with the vocals, and the guitar work is pretty cool. All of the tunes are lively and listenable. My favorite ones are ""Calling Dr. Love"" and ""Hard Luck Woman."" ""Hard Luck Woman"" is a nice song, while ""Calling Dr. Love"" features cool vocals from Gene Simmons. Rock and Roll Over is worth a listen."
3,not bad. KISS is still true to themselves here,"Post Alive! era is still going well with the release of this album. This has some good songs but nothing terrific. Love 'em....wow...hide your daughters. This song is probably the purest reason any guy would want to be in a band. Who am I to complain with this? Again, go Peter! Another really bad song! How many lives has he used up with baby driver?"
3,Kiss,Well i am no Kiss fan. I bought this album on a sale for just 6bucks. Ok this album is a basic rock'n'roll album. This albumhas basically 10 hard rock songs that are between 2 to 4 mintues length and sound all similar. I don't think a Kiss fan will bedissapointed with this cd 'cause this is truly what they digabout Kiss. So if you want to begin to dig Kiss. Buy this album.But for a regular music fan like me. This album is just average.I liked their album Hotter Than Hell better
3,Excellent rake. Significant disappointment in the manufacturer,"If you are looking for one of the best rakes available, this is probably it. It is not a lightweight rake, but that is what will make this one last when others will not. As my title indicates however I am quite disappointed with the company. I very often shop at Amazon but before buying I regularly go to the manufacturer's website to find details about them and their product. One of the reasons I chose this product is that the mfr. indicated very clearly that it was made in the USA. While the handle may be made here (I don't know), the rake head is made in China. Stamped right into it. I am seriously concerned about the vast numbers of products now made in China and imported back to the US. It kills jobs here and is driven by greed. I paid more for this rake than I needed to and was happy to do that when I ""knew"" it was made in the US. I was deceived by this mfr. and will not purchase another product from them."
4,Beethoven 4th symphony,I was looking for the 4th specifically and happy with this recording. Entries are clear and tempos steady. Recommended
2,doesn't get it,"I suggest avoiding this recording and getting Leonard Bernstein's version of this symphonyBeethoven: Symphonies Nos. 6 ""Pastoral"" & 8; King Stephen Overture, which is incredible. Bernstein's version feels like the natural way this melodic, uplifting, and surprising symphony was intended to be performed. (Though I do tend to skip the storm movement.) Musical things are happening throughout on different levels at once. Very thrilling and satisfying.I also got the Bruno Walter version based on some of the reviews. I simply do not understand those reviews. Walter's version is stiff and unflowing. I can't imagine a worse interpretation. It is more robotic than pastoral."
2,LOOK FURTHER,"My taste in action:I thought this was on the sleepy side. Let's face it, the No. 4 has real drive andboldness. Lacking here. I'd check out Hogwood or the City of Birmangham or Franz Bruggen (sp?). Through them I've come to love the 4th! Work of geniusfrom LVB, ""Mr. Excitement"" himself."
4,fun,"my niece loved it, it was missing pieces that should have been attached to it so the strap could attach to the guitar and it was a little damaged with chips in it but my niece liked it the way it was so we kept it."
1,misleading title,"I'm a regular inshore fisherman. Shark, Cobia, Tarpon, and King Mackeral are hardly inshore fishing targets. Only rarely are sharks, cobia, and king mackeral caught inshore, and Tarpon is very localized.I've ordered two fishing videos from Amazon - unfortunately both were very expensive and very misleading in their titles."
3,Very Dated,"When first printed in 1974, this would have been a ground-breaking read for women of faith, introducing the concept of options for women's lives inside and/or outside the home. In 2011, however, it is mostly very dated and mostly not worth the read unless as a snapshot of Christian feminist history. Two of the fifteen chapters, however, are notable exceptions: one about women in several of the pagan Biblical nations, each discussed individually; and the second about wasting the church's gifts. Especially the former makes this book a keeper for me despite its otherwise datedness. It does seem logical that this book is no longer in print, unless it can be updated through and through."
5,hair on end performance,"I must respectfully disagree with the above reviewer and agree with the Penguin guide which gives this recording it's highest highest 4 star rating and a ""key"". Are we hearing the same disc? This performance of Berlioz's great symphony is electric from beginning to end. It is a wild no holds barred performance that will leave you wondering how they did it. The performance was from a live Royal Albert Hall Proms concert in 1971 and is a must for anyone who likes this work. Get a load of the wild cheering from the Londoners!!If you can find it Zecchi's performance with the Czech Phil from 1959 on the old Supraphonet label is a great one. Just listen to the power of the brass at the end. Rozhdestvensky's performance with the State Symphony Orch of the Ministry of Culture from 1988 is pretty good also - on the extinct Russian Revelation label."
3,A dull 'Symphonie fantastique' barely offset by an exciting 'Francesca',"I was misled by a gushng review in the Gramophone into buying this lackluster CD. The Berlioz is in dull, cavernous stereo form 1971, the venue being Albert Hall. Rozhdestvensky, who can tactfully be called a vairable conductor and impolitely called a lazy one, gives Symphonie fantastique a generally staid reading that occasionally erupts with loud, crude energy.The Tchaikovsky raises the stakes considerably. It's a fervent reading, in mono from 1960, of Francesca da Rimini. The Leningrad Phil. is much more involved in this work, but a strong Francesca is hardly enough to salvage a reissue that is one of the weker ones form BBC Legends."
1,exercise from the chest and triceps,i want to see more videos about mr olimpia because i am very big fan at this sports.i make sports at gym and home but i don t have time very much because i work to much
4,An Intrigue Looking for a Hero,"A foremost authority on pirates, a megalomaniac descendent of Napoleon, a secret agent, an opera singer, an unspoiled rich American beauty and others gather at a mansion for what was thought to be a pleasure cruise, but is a search for buried treasure. This adventure is told mainly through the eyes of an adventurous journalist, but the deepest motives of many of these people are traversed as events rush towards the conclusion. Who will panic, who will hide, who will step forward, who will protect whom. The mystery of the treasure ends up being secondary to how each person reacts to the pressure and temptations of which they are thrust. So the real climax, as in most MacGrath stories is in how true character and indeed heroism show in people, both high-born and ""common"". This is an enjoyable and gripping character study/revelation."
5,Ultra Series Tripod,"So far so good with this tripod and it is a great accessory for my brand new Canon HV30. The bubble levels add so much, especially when shooting on uneven ground and you're trying to level out your shot. With that said, adjusting the sticks are a simple task and the locking knobs and mount screws seem to be durable. I've put the Ultra Series Tripod through a few test runs and shot set ups so I'm not sure how it will do should filming get a bit rugged, but I will update the review should anything adverse happen. I'd definitely recommend it for the amateur filmmaker as it has measuring markers that a script supervisor/continuity person can take note of should you need to reshoot or whatever. Casual video enthusiasts can utilize this as well but may not use all of the features."
4,Great value...,Money well spent... Light weight... Smooth operation... Only problem is one of the locks does not lock consistanly...
3,"Good, not great","I needed a tall tripod but without much money to spend my choices were limited. I have been using it for two years, and though it is cheaply made and minor things break, it still works well. It is fairly lightweight, which I need since I hike with it (I hooked a guitar strap to it so I can sling it over my shoulder.) Criticisms: Tension on vertical pole is hard to adjust and does not hold settings but that is no big deal to me. One leg came out of its socket but duct tape fixed that. Screw fell out of vertical crank handle but it was easy to repair. Operationally, my biggest gripe is the pan tension adjustment. Hard to get just the right resistance for panning, so I would not recommend it for video work (I shoot stills). Tilt tension works great. For the money it is a pretty good tall tripod for still photography and while not especially durable it has been easy to fix. A really good tripod costs a lot more money."
1,Not for do-it-yourself learning; barely adequate as a lab manual,"This is, as best as I can tell, a Simmons professor's lab notes, set in type with very, very bad photographs, and bound as a book. As a manual to learn to do it oneself, this book is utterly inadequate. As a lab manual, I'd be ashamed to use it in an undergraduate level course, much a graduate level preservation course or lab. Don't bother."
2,I'm not really a fan of this genre,"This book wasn't extremely deep or anything but it was entertaining. It wasn't what I expected as the author focused more on developing the environment and trying to make Wonderland seem as real as possible. There wasn't as much character development as I expected and no real relationship building between the characters. The development that does take place is very quick without a lot of explanations so it's kind of hard to really be vested in the characters and their lives.That being said I did like how he changed the story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and I liked what he did with the different parts of the story that were normally really childish and fantastical and made them more realistic with more reasoning behind it.I would recommend this book as a surface entertainment but do not read it if your looking for something deep with rich and multifaceted characters."
2,You think this is good?,"What is wrong with you guys?? This book is awful. Just plain awful. I went into the book expecting Wonderland to be described really well and all the fantastical elements expected in a good fantasy or science fiction novel. This had almost no detail on the scenery. The characters are underdeveloped, its just plain bad. From the first couple of chapters, I could tell the book was a waste of 17 bucks, but I rarely quit on a book, so I finished it and still felt it was a waste of time and money. The IDEA for the book was amazing. Someone should really try to write a series or a book that takes ideas from this book but actually makes it good."
1,Zzzzzz.....,"Not a lick of character development in this book, which makes me not give a hoot about what happens to anyone in this story. This book reads like a Cliff's Notes version of what a better book could be. It reads like he just wanted to get his ideas down on paper as quickly as possible, get it to the publisher and cash in. The story is rushed, the plot is rushed and his descriptions of the characters and world around them couldn't be less vivid. This thing needs a reboot by another author."
2,So disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book because I enjoyed Alice in Wonderland so much. But I could not even get to page 50 before I shut the book and gave up.Yes, this is a YA novel, but I've read YA novels that are written MUCH better than this. Just because it is intended for younger audiences does not mean the writing should be allowed to suffer.I had the same problem with Twilight--intriguing story idea but, when I began reading it, I felt like I was reading online fan fiction written by a rather untalented middle schooler.I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buying it."
4,Will make you wish there was a real Wonderland!,"I have really enjoyed reading this series ( I am halfway through Book 2). I had forgotten how much I enjoyed the story of Alice in Wonderland. My interest was recently sparked by the miniseries on the SyFy channel, which led me to a wikipedia search where I discovered the Frank Beddor series. The series may be in the young adult section in Borders, but like Harry Potter, there are many things for adults to enjoy as well. Much like the reimangined storytelling in Wicked and Mirror, Mirror (Gregory Maguire), Beddor has added some interesting and compelling aspects to the original story without disrespecting the original storytelling. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of fairytale remixes :)"
4,"Exciting story, but lacks character and Wonderland development","I was really excited to read this book. I liked the concept of the book and the cover very much. I knew it was a book for a younger audience, but I figured it was perfect since I would be reading it with my son.I liked the first book overall and was excited to read it. However, I felt it was lacking some important things. For starters, I really wanted to get to know the characters better. I found I really didn't care much for any of them, and that's because I didn't really know any of them.I also felt I knew very little about Wonderland. I mean, we're talking about a whole different world here. And yet, I couldn't even imagine it in my mind as I read this book.I did like the fact that the story took Alyss to Earth and that the original ""Alice in Wonderland"" was tied in with this story. Very good idea, in my opinion.I wish I could have given this book 3.5 stars instead of 4."
4,wondering,"we were in our local library...dear lovers of fantasy,... when we saw a poster featuring the cover of the second book in this seriesSeeing Redd: The Looking Glass WarsBook Two, promoting the virtues of reading to the young. We liked this poster so much (we're the type of people who used to buy albums [when there were albums] for their cover) that we decided to check the series out and were quite pleasantly surprised. We can't say it will go among our favorite books but this first one is quite good and we will be reading the second in the series.kyela,the silver elves"
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"I have never written a review on Amazon, but after reading ""The Looking Glass Wars"" I just couldn't resist!Beddor really has a way with writing. ""The Looking Glass Wars"" is captivating, and literally transports you in the world of Wonderland where you experience all the adventure and drama that goes with it. Beddor's style really reminds me of J.K Rowling's. He has a way of making everything connect to everything else and a way with detail that really paints a vivid picture in your mind.Much more than a childrens book, it deals with the hardships of maturity as well as the struggles one faces with not just others, but themselves.I agree with fellow members when I say that this book would make a fine movie! I also agree with reading it before someone else paints the picture for you! I'll be eagerly awaiting the next installment. This is definately a series I don't want to miss out on!"
4,Kudos to Frank Beddor!,I completely enjoyed the book to it's fullness. However there were some minor potholes that the story dragged in; they were easy to look over and move on though. Get this book and you won't regret it.
3,A good children's book,"This book is fun and entertaining, but written a little simplistically.But it's a great read for children, probably aged 10-16 who have good imaginations."
4,Entertaining,"It was an interesting take on an old classic. To see a different view of a fantasy world that most know from childhood. Kept me turning the pages, to see how the characters evolved."
4,Full of Violent Battles,"I really liked this book because it was a new and exciting twist on Alice in Wonderland. It's supposed to be what really happened to Alyss and even explains how the tale we know as Alice in Wonderland came about. I liked the action and adventure of Alyss and the bodyguard. This book is full of violent battles and action packed adventures. I recommend this book to ages 12 and up, it could be a bit too scary and complex for younger readers. I realy enjoyed the book and have already picked up the sequel at the library."
1,"Great concept, poor execution.","I picked this book and it's follow up Seeing Redd from the library because it seemed so fantastic a concept. On reading through the first book however, I was terribly dissapointed. Many of the events are interesting but the command of language and ability for the author to paint a scene are just not there. I was especially disgruntled when entire swaths of the book read out like a child trying to act out some kind of action sequence from a cartoon. Lot's of ""fwoosh fwoosh, clank, bzz! and Hack! and Pow!"" if you know what I mean. For those of you who haven't had little brothers or son's to reference this description, I apologize. When I finished the book I turned it over and read about the author and discovered he is a movie director. Suddenly it all made sense. This guy can see it in his head but he just can't translate it to a page. Don't waste your time!"
2,Yeesh.,"I admire Beddor's gusto in exploring an 'alternate world' Alice in Wonderland, but the result is pretty middling. First: if you're going to mess with one of the enduring classics of literature - much less a classic with a sociopolitical subtext that isn't even meant for young people to understand - you'd better be a fantastic writer. Second: you'd better have good reasons to populate your alternate world with Star Wars castoffs designed by Doug Chiang and extras from 'The O.C.' What are those reasons, by the way? And finally: if you want people to read your book and imagine it as a movie - just cut to the chase and write a screenplay, not a book."
1,Awwwwww,"I usually don't write reviews...mostly because I'm lazy. For this book, I simply must. The author's writing style really bothers me. I read a lot and I appreciate each author has his/her own style, yet...this author writes like a child! This is a children's book, but there's no reason to write like one."
5,Thanks!,"My son has not read these books yet, he is finishing up his current book and then on to this trilogy. He flipped through the first one and thought it looked awesome so I decided this was a MUST for one of his Christmas presents! Nothing is more thrilling than hearing your kid get so excited about books! It came quickly and in perfect condition as promised, Thanks!"
4,Not for kids,"I personally loved it, but this is NOT a childrens book. My husband bought it for our son (10) for Christmas (without looking at it very closely). Our son only made it through a few pages, and it's not 'cause the book was too advanced (he's read all the Harry Potters).I picked it up last week and really enjoyed the ""Alice"" twist, but understood why my son didn't like it. It's contains fairly graphic scenes of violence, that are NOT for ages 9-12. It's clear to me that who ever listed that age range did not read the book (and also doesn't have kids). I'd recommend it for highschoolers, at the youngest. Ok, maybe junior high, but certainly not elementary school.My 2 cents."
1,An Insult to Any Reader,"From cover to cover, 'The Looking Glass Wars' fails by varying degrees thanks to an unstable narrative style and too much tongue in cheek, ""aren't I witty?"" blather. To believe in the reality of any work of fiction, the reader must be taken in like a fly to a cunning spider's lair. Frank Beddor, with the use of many elementary narrative tricks with very little follow through, weaves this book into a tangle of loopholes that have you guiltily attentive to the end the way many of us rubberneck at a car accident."
5,"A Fantastic ""re-taling"" of a timeless classic","I had been watching this book for a while and was unsure if it might hold my interest, but finding it bargained priced recently I just couldn't resist--WOW! I really loved the way Mr. Beddor has re-envisioned this classic tale! It is quite cleverly done so that you really could see the possibility of young Alyss Heart's being betrayed by original author Lewis Carrol's telling of the story. I was thrilled by the inclusion of intersting technologies and clever characters you just can't help but want to know more about. For instance, the queen's bodyguard, Hatter Madigan--not a dimwitted tea party goer but a tough-as-nails secret service agent with many splendid weapons at his disposal. There are many characters like this and everthing about the story just seems ""fresh"" and ""FUN!""--James Somers: author The Chronicles of Soone."
3,Well it wasn't terrible.....,"This book will no doubt attract those Alice In Wonderland fans out there. Frankly, that's who this book is for. So I just want to make it clear that I too love that book.I picked up this book hoping to get a fun reimagining to quench my Wonderland thirst. What I got was something strangely different. You've seen everything in this book before, so it's not revolutionary by any rate. Things that you'd expect from an Alice book, like verbal nonesense and ridiculous scenarios are not present. It tries to come off rather serious. Staples from the Alice-mythos only make up small references in this telling. Change around a few characters and it wouldn't resemble Alice In Wonderland at all.Still, I enjoyed the book and have already purchased the sequel. I will be starting on that soon.While you won't love this book with as much enthusiasm as the original, it's worth a try. Like I've said, it's like a B-rate action movie. Don't go in with high hopes."
5,New way to look at Wonderland,"As a big fan of Gregory Maguire's books, Wicked, Son of a Witch, etc. I love these ""classic stories twisted around."" We all know the story of Alice in Wonderland, but this new version makes Alyss real. I loved it and reccommend it, again, not only for newly independant readers but also for adults."
4,"Good, but not for me","Beddor takes the story everyone knows and throws it out the window. This is a fresh look into who ""Alice"" really is - a princess in Wonderland fleeing for safety after her parents are murdered by the scheming Redd, who wants to be Queen.There is a lot of play on words throughout, and the explanation for the story we are accustomed to is quite clever. A lot of potential with this series, but it's just not for me. While I enjoyed the retelling, I do not plan to continue the series.An absolute must-read for any fan of Alice or YA lit."
2,Completely missed the mark,"I just plain didn't get this book, and I really, really wanted to love it. I pushed myself to page 100 before I gave up the cause. Not only did the writing never engage me, the story was so loosely based on Alice in Wonderland that I would hardly call it a retelling of the same book. Yes, some of the characters had the same names, but they were completely up-ended--the Mad Hatter a martial artist? The White Rabbit a dottering old scholar? Come on, now; at least try to preserve a hint of what made us love the book in the first place. It seemed more like the author wanted to capitalize on the popularity of Alice in W. in order to get his book published. The book read like a record of gory, political strategy and there was nothing to pull me in. So disappointing."
4,Great twist on a old classic!,"This book is really fun to read. It's full of mystery and advendure and you are never sure what is going to happen. Plus, there is a little bit of a love story that starts to bloom at the end and I feel that at the end of reading this book, I have to get the 2nd so that I know what has happened to all the characters. I have actually been having dreams about the book and I only dream about the good ones. It is so easy to fall in love with all of these characters. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Alice in Wonderland meets the Sci-Fi Channel,"A smattering of creative ideas and concepts punctuate an otherwise clumsy storyline and confusing plot in this inversion of Lewis Carroll's childish dreamscape. The landscape of the Wonderland dimension is interesting (though perhaps a little hard to believe that our world is the derivative and Wonderland the original), and the basic plot is simple enough, but be prepared for a much more violent adventure than even ""Harry Potter"", that begins with children witnessing a bloody coup and the brutal beheading and murder of their own parents. This might be a good pick for older kids who love comic books."
5,Best New Balance out there,"I have been wearing new Balance classics since Highschool, that was over 15 years ago. These are the best shoes I've had since the early nineties. They are made well, fit perfect. Get the size you are they are right on. Also the customer service was A+ they were on my doorstep within days and I talked the the seller who was really cool. Thanks again_m"
3,Ideal camouflage,"These shoes are perfect for getting ahead in the ongoing struggle for survival in your modern law offices. Not only do the soles provide ideal traction for rapid charges and retreats on low-pile striped-pattern earthtone carpets, but the neutral flesh color enables you to blend undetectably into the background scenery of a high-pressure strategy meeting. Buy two, they're cheap at the price."
5,Nice cleaner,"Bought this because I ran out of the same one given to me by the manufacturer. I have quartzite tile throughout my home, and this is the quality, neutral ph cleaner that I need. Works great; smells good too."
4,great for slate,I have slate walls in my bathroom and this product keeps it clean at can affordable price. I would buy this again.
1,This import CD is no longer relevant,No need to spend $200 on this disc because the 3 bonus tracks can be found on Velvet Crush's CD called 'A Single Odyssey'. You get all 3 bonus tracks found on this import plus all the other b-sides and what-nots from other Velvet Crush releases.If you are a collector of the actual music track and not so much for the packaging - skip this overpriced import; get the regular domestic version of 'Teenage Symphonies' and 'A Single Odyssey'; those 2 discs together will cost you ALOT less than this import disc.You can thank me later - or now. ;-)
5,A classic that never got its due ...,"Velvet Crush's ""Teenage ..."" remains their crowning achievement. All but a few tracks are superb, among the best of the mid-'90s power-pop genre -- sweet and catchy hooks nestled underneath wry and bitter lyrics. Think Green Day with a soft twang, or Wilco with more venom. The band settles into a groove somewhere between the Byrds, Gram Parsons and Elvis Costello, a chord-driven, country-cum-punk. The tunes rock even if the lyrics occasionally whine. Universally praised, and rightfully so, ""Teenage ..."" did everything for VC except sell, unfortunately. An album people could be talking about in 15-20 years, a la Big Star, and going ... ""Geez, how did we miss this?"""
2,Slowwwwww!Jam.,"To Put it simply this player,s album was a rush job,the acoutics were bad,the sound terrible and to much feedback uggh! Basically this was a rehersal session for The Players for an up coming concert date.I,ve heard that The Players did a live album for westbound although i don,t know how true that is,anyway skip this album unless your an true ohio players fan or can get it dirt cheap."
2,"If you like crappy LIVE recordings, you'll love this one!","When I bought this, I had forgotten which album my buddy had when we were teenagers. I mistook JAM for GOLD and Media-Play did not have GOLD for comparison, so I ended up getting JAM. BIG MISTAKE. The instruments drown out the vocals. It is extremely loud on some songs and quiet on others. It is also quite hard to make out the words even though I remembered most of them. As in a lot of LIVE recordings the group sings too fast and improvises a lot. The core songs are pretty much trashed, the others are bearable. Tonight I ordered GOLD and can't wait to hear it."
3,"Some good, some bad","I purchased this book and followed the devotionals for a couple of weeks, then read ahead and stopped. I saw that Matthews was falling far too deeply into a modern, New Age sentimentalism that contradicts what I have seen to be Celtic beliefs for me to use it. I don't think this book is sufficiently Celtic to be called such. Some of the poetry and other materials are very good, but I could have done without the eco-politics beyond a certain point, and its lack of recognition of the political issues in the Celtic nations was a significant failure. How can this be Celtic if it doesn't deal with the issues faced by living Celts?"
3,Not all that I expected.,"Contrary to the first reviewers opinion (Nov. 18, 1999), this book is not a devotional text. I think this person has gotten this text confused with ""The Celtic Spirit"", a devotional text by the same author.As for the ""Celtic Book of Days"" it is a well laid out calendar. Not quite what I expected, it seems to be lacking depth, and some days don't have very much information or artwork at all. I truly expected more.If you wish to use it as a tabletop calendar, why not? That's what I use if for, but as a study tool there really isn't much there, which is fine as well. The passages mainly consist of brief poems or sayings, quick history reviews of ideas and significance of days. As I said earlier... not what I expected, but not a total disappointment either.Not much more then a starter conversational piece IMHO."
3,The book of Celtic Snippets,"""The Celtic Book of Days"" By Caitlin Matthews is more of a book of daily factoids than a spirituality and wisdom book. Once this fact is realized you can enjoy reading on a daily basis and seeing if you know that fact or not. If not then you have the fun of finding out more. Once in a while the snippet reads more like a Chinese fortune cookie.Besides being split up in to daily snippets there is an over all calendar to keep you informed of the seasons, a decent bibliography, and index. This makes a great coffee table conversation book."
4,eliminates the dog odor smell when vacuuming,"These are a bit pricey, which lowers it one star, but they are sturdily made. I purchased them because we have dogs and there is a doggy odor after vacuuming that bothers my husband. These worked very well for preventing that problem."
4,Reduces Smell,I hate that dusty bag vacuum cleaner smell that seems to come out of any vac no matter how much you pay for it. Sure enough eliminates the problem. Nothing but air with no dusty smell even when nearly full.
5,Ingersoll was the greatest humanist that ever lived.,"Robert Ingersoll could outwit and out argue just about anyone-- even in his childhood days. To read his logic is to say to yourself, ""Why didn't I think of that!"" Here's an example: He points out in Genesis that light and dark were created on the first day and the sun was created on the third day. Well, anyone who studied physics in college knows you can not have light without a light source. I studied physics, but before that I studied religion in Sunday school. Religionists are very good at indoctrinating and brainwashing their young followers. When I went to college I soaked up Ingersoll's works like a sponge. I needed the truth and set my mind straight. If you are a humanist, an agnostic or perhaps intellectually curious, you will enjoy reading and studying any or all of the lectures of Robert Ingersoll."
4,beautifully brutal,"I couldn't wait for this to arrive. It arrived perfectly discrete in a big box. I was so anxious to get it inside me. I am in heaven. After three sessions, I manage 12"" but even 10"" feels so good. I too can see it poke my belly up as I pound my ass. This is not for amateurs but for those of us who have experience with deep anal cravings. It has real girth and the veins are fabulous! The only problems I found so far is that it is so large it weighs about 3 lbs. and it is a bit flimsy so one hand has to guide it as I rode it. It was difficult to handle with one hand while plunging it in and out. I ended up cutting it off at the balls and it made it easier to handle...I like pounding better than riding anyway. I get wonderfully powerful orgasmic anal contractions with this monster and it also leaves a great gape ;)"
3,Not for beginners/difficult to handle when slippery,It's not for beginners. When it is lubed up it can be very slippery. The suction cup part is pretty much useless because the thing is so huge and heavy. It can be somewhat cumbersome to deal with...i guess i'll keep working on it...but it is hard to handle sometimes.
2,Using this book might result in getting your tail kicked,"I hope that the author doesn't decide to exact his revenge upon me, but using the tactics described in this book seems like a good way to get yourself arrested or beaten to a pulp. Some of the techniques are workable if you have a high tolerance for risk, but I would not recommend this book from a legal standpoint."
5,It's True,"It's true, Dogs Are Worth It! No one can put a smile on your face like Schulz can. I purchased my copy to give as a gift but I wasn't able to give it up."
3,Crisp Pictures in a Small Package,"The Panasonic DMC-FX12 is a great supplement to a larger SLR. It's easy to tuck into a pocket or purse to catch those pictures that inevitably pop up when you decided not to lug your big camera around. The Leica lens is sharp, and when used at its highest resolution, the camera can produce quality large prints. With a 2 gigabyte card you can record an entire trip without having to download your pictures to a computer."
2,Good only while it lasts,"I had been very pleased with this camera until it suddenly developed oil spots on the interior of the lens. I was instructed by Panasonic to send it in for repairs. After 3 weeks I finally received my camera back in good working condition only to have the oil spots appear again two weeks later. At that point I requested a replacement but was informed by Panasonic that my only recourse was to continue to send it back for repairs. Unacceptable. I would strongly urge all considering this product, or any Panasonic product, to think long and hard before taking the plunge as, my experience has been that the company will not stand behind their product."
3,Nice and Simple,"This workbook stood out to me first, for it's affordable price. I needed some workbooks/ideas for a workshop I was doing. This is definately the way to go for a special needs group. It goes over the information and key ideas, then gives fill in the blank questions for the group."
5,"Only One ""Flaw"" in an Otherwise ""Perfect"" Compilation...","The omission of both the vocal and instrumental versions of ""Well, We Finally Made It"" from the group's debut 20th Century album from which a couple of this release's tunes come. I really wore out my stylus on that track a quarter of a century ago.Other than that, this is one GREAT packaging of the trio's best!"
3,"Please re-issue ""Under The Influence of Love"" NOW!","It's unbelievable that the biggest hit album of this marvellous trio has NEVER been issued on CD. As good as this compilation is, some songs are missing from the original album (most of all the beautiful ""Say It Again"") and ""Under the Influence"" is still the best memory existing from this group. They never made an album like this. So when can we get a remaster?"
5,Mahler Symphony 5-Bruno Walter,"After hearing this recording, I am so greatfull it exists. Bruno Walter was the most important, and the best, interpreter of Mahlers' symphonies(apart from the composer himself)and this first recording of the complete Mahler 5 is an important reason why.I first heard this recording in a previous CBS edition, and I found the sound quality and background noise annoying, but this remastered Bruno Walter Edition CD is a great improvement-the sound is alot clearer and properly conveys the strengths of this great recording, an account full of colour, a feeling akin to nature, and a tight, dynamic sound that is a thrill to listen to.Walter goes deep into the score on this one, and creates an atmosphere that is all his own, and very special, making for a truly definitive performance. After you hear this, all those subsequent versions seem second-rate."
4,A trip to the past,"This recording was made in the forties or fifties,hence its lesser technical quality.In this analogue recording the percussion section,for instance,sounds as if it is playing from within a submarine but the musical qualities more than make up for the technical downside. If you are used to lushious,full,sticky, hard to comprehend performances of Mahler symphonies you will be pleasantly surprised. Walter's rendering of the piece is cristal clear. Mahler down to it's [his] bare essentials. The inner voicings and subtles changes are very obvious and the music is made comprehensible.This attention to details matches the superb shaping of the whole piece and suddenly it all makes sense! One should also mention the beautiful playing of the orchestra with special notice of the first trumpeter."
4,definitive... not!!!,"Very good version by the great mahlerian director Bruno Walter. But whoever has listened to the versions by Barshai, Schwarz and Shipway is not likely not come back to him..."
1,The word-toolkit model,"Sorry, but reading the book I got the feeling that the author is using the word-toolkit to describe the Universe, and is limited then by that toolkit. He seems to exist in a world defined by words. The Universe seems to be a bit more simultaneously and dynamically complex than that, across a scale of entangled detail density that is very hard to even begin to hold in a mind. The best authors and explorers seem to start with the Universe and try to expand the toolkit to express their visions. This is a difficult and untidy process with very different results. What is a symbol? It is never the thing being symbolized, and it is never static. So what is it? I enjoyed the book, but did not agree in many places because of the narrowed and selective causality used. I also tend to consider metaphors to be inherently incorrect attempts to describe."
3,Disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed Hofstadter's book, Godel, Escher, Bach and was hoping for more of the same type of insight in this book. The author comes across as a very likeable person, but alas I did not find anything deep or profound in this book.I also disagree with the author's assertion that negation is not an essential part of consciousness. It is true that there can be self-reference without negation, but self-reference is only a part of consciousness. To be conscious is to choose and to choose is to deny one set of possibilites while opting for another. Thus the power of negation must be at the very heart of the ""I."""
1,What?,"It's likely unfortunate that I picked this book of his to be my first from what others have said here. I'm going to agree with all the other one and two star ratings who can speak to his books deficiencies much better than me. I will say that it seemed extremely self promoting and self indulgent. His arguments for vegetarianism are weak and not thought out well at all IMO. His idea of a ""soul"" left me wondering if he had lost his senses and his idea of ""big souls"" fit perfectly his own self image and I'm sure he wrote it while staring into a mirror. I thought it might possibly be me until I read the one and two star reviews. I think he's wacky."
2,"Gödel, Escher Bach Lite","Title says all!Too much wit, too little novelty since his seminal 1979 book..."
4,Consistently Hofstadter,"I am 2/3 through the book and enjoying it immensely. It is consistently Douglas Hofstadter. It is the same style as GEB, and as I find out, the same style he has had since age 16. (There is an introduction consisting of a mind/thought paper Douglas wrote as a teenager.)"
2,The Strange Loop is a Granny Knot,"While this book is entertaining and insightful,it is also, in many sections, pedantic andrepetitive. You may get some new informationout of it, but it does not hold a candle to GEB(Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid),his seminal work.The enthusiasm wasn't there. I miss it."
3,I Am a Strange Loop,"I have read Hofstadter's classic on Godel, Escher and Bach, but was disappointed by his latest work. Possibly because it is just too difficult to know who ""I""really is without a much deeper understanding of our minds which may well be unreachable because we cannot go outside to take a look. However the chapters on Russell's Principia Mathematica and Godel's refutation are very clear and well worth reading."
2,Redundant,"If you're interested in buying this book, you've probably already read it. The first half of it was called Godel, Escher, Bach, and the second half was called The Mind's I. But the amusing dialogues of GEB and the influential essays of The Mind's I are missing, leaving nothing but a dry exposition of Hofstadter's worldview that you probably already know.I suppose the book would go over better with someone who was new to Hofstadter, but then such a person would still be better off reading Godel, Escher, Bach and making most of this book redundant in the process."
3,Math is not Reality or is it?,"Struggling with the age old question of what is consciousness Hofstader brings his gift for making up fictional worlds, metaphors, and his knowledge of mathematics to convey his answer. Ultimately the metaphors and fictional worlds fail to convey the answer and for me became contrived. It maybe a personal bias but I find fictional world examples particularly annoying. The old imagine a world where everyone has blond hair stuff can get very old. He excels with a math analogy as the definitive truth. Unfortunately it too is another metaphor and the author fails to realise it. Math is not a reality; nor in my opinion is it an affective language for this type of discussion. Attempting to make it the driver fell flat for me. I would say if your interested in the question of consciousness then Hofstader does have a lot to offer. It will give you hours of debate with your friends."
3,"Godel, Escher, Bach...again","Interesting book. If you haven't read Godel, Escher, Bach it is certainly worth picking up. If you have read GEB, then you can probably pass on this one."
5,Nice complement to GEB,"If you have already read and enjoyedGodel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, then you should read this. Just don't expect GEB 2.If you have not, then go read that first, then read this."
1,"fancy package, no content","Why did he write this book? What was his goal? What was I to get from it?Having read GED more than once, I was looking for some new insights, or at least questions. I finished the book angry at myself for having wasted the time, at the publisher and the writer for wasting trees, but glad it was from the library so my own money wasn't wasted.I don't recall ever experiencing such growing frustration and disappointment, reading page after page, searching for but finding no substance.Dougie, you didn't have another book in you after all. The typeface and page layout were great though.Lhadro"
1,The Risible State of Consciousness Studies,Is there anything more risible than the current state of consciousness studies? Over the past two decades one respected commentator after another has come to grief in trying to explain it. In 'I Am a Strange Loop' Professor Douglas Hofstadter offers a model which is astonishingly devoid of any significant reference to advances in brain science. Instead he offers a notion rooted in philosophical idealism which leads straight to solipsism. What will come next? Strange Attractors?
3,The human mind is the greatest mistery.,"The autor leads us into the mistery about what the man really thinks and which are the mental processes those allow that. It no very simple follows the several argument, but the auctor is able to interesting always . The fundamental concept is that, when a theory is related with itself, it borns something as the life."
3,Lacks harmony. Rambling collection of ideas,"Possibly because Godel,Escher, Bach (GEB) showed such ingenuity and originality, almost anything else produced by the author would measure short of its standard. Surprisingly the current work rehashes several of the core themes of GEB, e.g. incompleteness, paradoxes, patterns,etc; and their implications for consciousness. It is along the latter axis that the book, in my opinion, fails to convince. The main challenge facing the reader is extracting a coherent theme from what is a medley of snippets of science, personal biography and flowery prose. I didn't fidn the book easy to read. It wanders, not necessarily insightfully, over huge areas of human development. The insights the author gains from the insertion of folksy passages are not obviously transferred to the reader. In a nutshell I thought the book tied itself in knots over conscious and the individuation of the self. Was it a worthwhile read? I am ambivalent."
1,Hofstadter disappoints,"I was excited when this book was published, as I read GEB a few years ago and enjoyed it immensely. Sadly, ""Strange Loop"" has none of the charm of Hofstadter's first work, and has virtually nothing new to offer. Most of this book is a simple re-hash of ideas and concepts from earlier works. Hofstadter tries to spice up the text with frequent analogies and thought experiments, but these offerings are strained and lack the wit that he has demonstrated in the past. Skip this (lengthy) book and read GEB again."
4,Far out,The ideas presented by Hofstadter are very interesting but his language is a little bit difficult for a person not speaking English as the first language. Normally I do not find English books difficult to read. But I keep trying. :-)
4,interesting book,"still trying to digest all the twists and turns and what this book ultimate means and what it serves within the mind and soul, however it makes for some interesting thoughts and its a thinking person's book from start to finish i'll say that much. so many metaphors and appear over and over again. RIP to his Wife who passed away far too soon and you feel her pressence is this book. i felt all the different aingles and purposes he was coming with and from with this book and its quite interesting and will make you pay attention to all the details be it big or small. everything to digest and mentally replay which makes a book compelling and a story worth sharing."
3,Not his best,"The whole premise of this book, is DH looking at what exactly is considered the self. He relates personal identity to the feedback produced by a tv camera or microphone/speaker. He also suggests to some degree it's all an illusion, brought about by learned response of the neurons in your head, and as such, other people can have a working representation of you that's almost as good as you. He uses this belief to console himself about his wife's death, that she is still somewhat alive in his head.There are long tangents dealing with his various in depth analogies, and consideration of how much of a ""soul"" various being and things have. Overall, he doesn't break much new ground, doesn't take a stand in favor of any beliefs, and the reader comes away with what could have simply been a carefree dinner discussion probably involving several glasses of wine. His other books are much better, and though I'm a DH fan overall, I was rather disappointed with I am a Strange Loop."
1,Damaged goods,I was very disappointed that one pair of the bookends arrived badly scratched -- kept them anyway as I needed something to use immediately but wouldn't order from this site again.
4,ALIVE 2...Lots better than Alive 3...but not as good as A1,"Side 1 - Great! Side 2 - Great! Side 3 - Great! Side 4....not-for-me. Detroit Rock City, Love Gun, Calling Dr. Love, Shout It Out Loud, I Stole Your Love - are great versions, but the studio tracks.......let's put it this way.....they have done better."
4,Good follow-up,"Though ALIVE II is not as natural as the first ALIVE!, it is still worth listening to. Containing all of their songs from the 1976-77 era, the album features 5 newer 1977 songs recorded in the studio. And they're not bad!!!"
4,Alive 2? or studio album?,"KISS Alive is a classic. The sound, the production, the songsand the cover just worked perfectly. Alive 2 didn't. It wasok and had good moments like Hard Luck Woman was a nice songto include and Side 4 is awesome. All American Man, RocketRide are killers! but the live production just wasn't goodand I have bootlegs that sound better and really capturedthe power of live show. I rated it 4**** but that's forside 4. I'd give the live show 3*** because KISS always didput their all on stage as I saw them 3 times on this tourand I can tell you I never left disappointed. So it's wortha listen if your a fan and if not you won't like it. KISSwas and still is one of the greatest rock bands in history."
5,Alive 2....,"One of the best live albums, with one of the best guitarists (Ace Frehley) doing the BEST guitar solo....ever! It never has been topped since I 1st heard this thirty years ago. The drum solo by Peter Criss is amazing as well. Great set list and vibe, a must for Kiss fans."
2,Bad Recording on Great Songs,I Love almost all these songs but even the last 5 tracks on disc 2 that werent live had very bad recording. i dont know what happened. its a good thing to have so you can show off but its really worthless if you have the albums that contain these songs.by the way.........ACE IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!2 best songs: Detroit Rock City (Live) & All American Man2 Worst Songs: Rocket Ride (.....sorry ace) & Rockin in the USA
2,PAUL'S ANNOYING VOICE RUINS IT!,"The studio side is much better than the concert material! Ace's song "" Rocket Ride"" is one of the few good moments! No offense to Paul, he really seems like a nice guy, but he has a very annoying tone of voice when he talks between the songs! He hurts my ears when he talks! And I think he probably hurts other peoples ears as well! He sounds ok on the studio albums, but not in concert! He should stop talking so much between songs, it takes away from the over all quality of the whole show! Why does Paul insist on doing it all the time! He should keep his thoughts to himself and play his guitar and leave the talking to Peter, Ace, or Gene ( they are all much better singers than Paul)!"
2,These Guys Can't Play,"Don't misunderstand...I'm 42 and grew up listening to these guys. I had an entire wall of my room devoted to KISS, Few people liked them as much as I did. ""Alive!"" was great! By this time (1977 or so), KISS had become cartoon characters. The cardboard ""gun"" in the Love Gun album did me in. ""Alive II"" is really terrrible - the sound is poor and the playing is all over the place."
3,Why Alive?,Live albums always suck. Write that 100 times if you are a record executive. I mean why would anyone release live material. It always sucks.
3,Too short,"Decent enough album, but absolutely NO reason (other than good ol' American greed) this isn't on a single disc. The two discs together are right at 72 minutes. No excuses. Save your money and find it cheap used somewhere if you need to have it. Otherwise, just save your money."
3,Alive II is NOT Alive! But still has it's moments.,"Alive II was my favorite KISS album growing up. The cover was great, the back cover was great and the AWESOME photo when you open the Album just blew me away! Plus all the KISS goodies that were included with Alive II, Tattoos, Booklet, Order Form. It was the ultimate KISS package for me, especially when you're 5 years old :) The stand-out tracks are:Detroit Rock City, Ladies Room, Love Gun, Shock Me, I Want You & the best of all ""Makin' Love"" this Alive II version F'N RULES!!!! as for Side 4, I'll go with my 4th favorite KISS song written & sung by Ace Frehley.... ""Rocket Ride""Like I said, not as good as Alive! but still worth having!"
4,Kiss Rock,"This is a graet live album but i never thought it was as good as the first live CD.While i still think it captures Kiss at their very best i have trouble with the studio side to the Cd.I have always felt that it should have been a completely live Cd.But i think the did not want to do some of the songs they had already done on Alive 1.While i like the studio side i never thought it was up to Kiss at their best.My fav song there is ""Any Way You Want It"".But the livepart of this Cd is consistently good and it kicks rock and roll butt."
4,Four Stars for Any Kiss Fan,"Although it is great that classic Kiss albums like this are available on CD now, there is a little of the original magic missing. Kiss Alive II is a perfect example of this. The CD does feature several studio tracks; however, the Live portion of Kiss Alive II is what makes this great. If you want the best, you got the best, the hottest band in the world.... Kiss. The Shock Me offereing on this CD is one of the gems for those of us that favored Ace. He was always my favorite, but each member has at least one standout moment on this CD. A must have for Kiss fans. I wore this album out as a pre-eenager, and as a teenager, and a little as an adult."
4,Bandidas,"Bandidas, starring Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek, I thought was a very entertaining movie and had some new laughs when they join forces to fight a ruthless enforcer by becoming celebrated bank robbers cheered on by their countrymen. Lots of action and a movies worth watching on a quiet rainy night."
3,Up Close: Mary Wilson @ the Copa Room,"Although this performance is about 15 years old, it was a pleasure to watch. Mary sings well, but it just seems strange to hear her singing lead on their hits. She does much better when she sings the slow ballads. Overall, I'm glad I added it to my collection."
2,Celebration of Gospel (2008),"I was very excited when I heard this DVD came out because I enjoyed the TV version so much. If you are looking for what you saw on TV, DO NOT PURCHASE this DVD. They cut so much out of it, it's a shame. Steve Harvey DOES NOT appear as the host -- you don't see anyone hosting, just SOME of the performers performing. I did see him in one of the church choir scenes with BeBe Winnans, but they covered his face so you couldn't see him. Maybe this has something to do with royalties and being paid, but I was very disappointed and will probably give the DVD away or let it collect dust on my shelf."
2,Cut too much out.,I enjoyed Celebration of Gospel when it came on television. This DVD representation is not what showed on televison. There was so much cut out that I would have been better off recording off of television on a VHS tape even though I have a DVD recorder. They should have called this DVD Half of Celebration of Gospel because it sure was not the complete package.
5,Loussier plays Chopin Nocturnes,"On this single CD by Telarc, Jacques Loussier forsakes the Trio to give discretely popularized versions of 21 Nocturnes by Frederic Chopin. They represent improvisations of classical pieces like we hear currently from Gabriela Montero. If you like Loussier's piano styling, and I think if you like Chopin, you will enjoy this set. The purists might object but I have had many hours of happy listening with this CD. The tranquil atmosphere of most of the nocturnes is preserved, but Loussier swings a little more on some tracks, like Nocturnes Nos 5 and 9 for example. As Loussier comments in the accompanying booklet, Nocturnes Nos. 17 and 18 that comprise Op.62 are some of the most musically substantial of the set and Loussier gives thoughtful performances. I have no complaints at all about these performances.Chopin: The Nocturnes"
1,an oxy-moron,"hey somebody ripped me off!yes the written content is full of great information, and is highly acclaimed. However the vast majority of the images used in this book are nearly unreadable due to the extremely poor reproduction quality and low image resolution. This leads me to wonder whether the book was printed at kinkos or printed from the high school's 150 dpi printer!i've seen photocopies that looked better than this! i'm not kidding!come on.. black text on dark grey background?were these conscious design decisions?note... the 1 star is to bring down the average. i bought the book due to the perfect record of all 5 stars, however i don't believe a book on design topics should get away with such horrid imagery for the price..2 of the 3 authors for this book are from xerox... i wouldn't doubt they used thier own xerox machine to reproduce the graphic designs found within the pages inside the cover."
5,We must learn to challenge icons.,"This book enters our sensibilites.We must learn to challenge our vulnerability toward icons. In order to take our place in the upcoming era, we must recognize how many burdens we have carried because we have reacted to iconography --a phenomena far deeper than mere affection toward slogans and images. A healthy human intelligence is adaptive not reactive. We must recognize the terrible demand upon us to develop a serious forethought.The approach and language of this book stimulates our desire to develop appropriate tools and poo-poos the fashions of populism --a phenomena at its worst in current computing circles!We're being drawn into using the computer for JUNK. This book asks us to grow up. Great idea!"
5,On another level,"The photographs in this book are on a level completely different from anything I've seen in recent memory. I own a lot of photo books, and this one is definitely my new favorite. The tones, grain and overall mood that Kenna achieves is incredibly beautiful, and the book is well designed and printed. Highly recommended."
2,okay...I won't get fooled again,"The disco era captured KISS in 1979. ""Lovin you"" and ""Sure know Something"" are good songs. Oddly enough the best song is 2000 man. Sung by Ace-written by the Stones. Go figure. Once again Peter has managed to write the worst song for the album. Go Catman!"
2,Dynasty!,"In 1979 Kiss released the album Dynasty. With the release of the album Dynasty Kiss tried an idea that they had previously explored with Double Platinum when they remade Strutter.They flirted with Disco on the tune I Was Made for Lovin You, which was actually a pretty good song,and became the big hit off the album.The other hit from Dynasty was Sure Know Something it wasn't as popular as I Was Made for Lovin You,but still one of the highlights from Dynasty.Another high point of the album is 2,000 Man.Other than these three songs Dynasty is rather weak when compared to Kiss's earlier albums.The band still plays good, but the filler,which sounds good just is not very entertaining even clocking around 40 minutes Dynasty does lose steam in the middle of the album.Listenable but not really that good as a whole,I recommend Dynasty for diehards only and some of them may be disappointed."
2,Disco KISS?,Sorry guys you know this review is true. The only good songs are from Ace and they are weak!! Yea I know this was your biggest international hit album but pluheeze!!!!!!! The cheese
4,Kissco.,"This is a cool album. It has a rock feel and some disco part's.I Was Made For Lovin' You:8/10 A big hit song for kiss. Has a disco sound.2,000 Man:7/10 Nice cover, With a rock vibe.Sure Know Something:8/10 Big time disco but, a good track.Dirty Livin':8/10 I like this one from Peter. Almost has a funk feel.Charisma:8/10 I was wondering Where Gene had been. He shows up with a cool song.Magic Touch:8/10 My favorite song from the album. Great guitar riff.Hard Times:7/10 Good one from Ace.X-Ray Eyes:6/10 Nothing great.Save Your Love:5/10 :( I don't like this song.A nice record. Way better then unmasked. You should give this one a try."
5,Could Be The Best KISS lp,This album has all four members bumping it up on all four cylinders.Enjoyable dirty down Kiss from beginning to end. Of Special note is Save your love and especially the best Peter Criss Kiss tune Dirty Livin.
4,"FINE EFFORT, ANYWAY !!","We all know it was not Peter who recorded the drums here (except for DIRTY LIVIN). Anton Fig was the drummer. Anyway, this is a fine record. No way it's in the same league of LOVE GUN, but it's still a little bit solid and well crafted. No reason to reap scorn upon ""I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN'YOU"". It's a pop song with foolish lyrics, but KISS always did that, the difference to other bands being that they did it with skill and mastery of their instruments and songwriting techniques. I like DYNASTY. It's definetely not near any of their firs six albuns, therefore was really the ""beginning of the end"", but it's a good rock record."
4,great!,"i think some of the reviews written for this cd judge it and the music of kiss too harshly...particularly the one written by david newman. i think it's a great cd..sure,it's not their best,but kiss has always been about having a good time and good music. and for those who overanalyze their music,they just don't get it. trust me,get this one if you're a kiss fan..it's better than most people make it out to be."
3,Kiss Goes Disco (Almost),"Some people think that Kiss should have stayed away from the disco influence and judging from thoroughly mediocre outing of ""Kiss Unmasked"" I would tend to agree. But at least here they were still writing half-way decent songs and playing them with some conviction. If you need an example of a successful marriage between hard rock and disco, ""I Was Made For Loving You"" fits the bill quite nicely. And I totally agree that ""2000 Man"" is an awesome cover. There are other examples of their songwriting craft that other reviewers allude to without being redundant.Not an essential album by any means but not an awful release, either. THAT would change shortly after....Keep the peace."
5,Honor for this 30 years old album!!! May 23th 1979-2009,"Today 30 years ago Dynasty was released. I rate 5 stars this album for the quality of the songs. Great classic rock, sounds very melodic and disco. Each song with own rhythm and tempo. Great perfomance, lyrics and vocals from four members specially Paul Stanley in I was made for loving you and Peter Criss in Dirty livin'. Beautiful sharpness voice of Ace Frehley in his three interpretations.1. I was made for loving you 5+/5 stars2. 2,000 man 5/5 stars3. Sure know something 5+/5 stars4. Dirty livin' 5+/5 stars5. Charisma 5/5 stars6. Magic touch 4/5 stars7. Hard times 5+/5 stars8. X-Ray eyes 3.5/5 stars9. Save your love 5+/5 starsYou can enjoy each track!!! A MUST HAVE for any Rocker. BUY IT! Thanks KISS for this album."
3,Not as Bad as Some Say,"I give this CD 3 stars for effort. It's not bad... Everyone always lumps this record in with their worst, but it's not as bad as some say. Yes, ""I Was Made For Loving You"" is cheesy disco pop, but there are some solid songs on here like ""Sure Know Something"" and ""Charisma"". Ace once again saves the day (at least for me) because he's got ""2000 Man"" and ""Hard Times"" on here, two of my faves. This CD isn't raw rock n' roll like their early stuff, but it's a good Contemporary (for 1979) Pop Rock Record, the drums are tight and if you're a big KISS fan, you'll dig it."
5,Great Underated Album,This is a great album that should be given more recognition. It is often said to be there disco album but I think it's agood balance of the two types of music.
2,Love band...HATE this album!,"I love KISS and they shattered my rock and roll fantasy of them on this album...I HATE ""I was made for loving you""...it is a disco sell out...they made up for this cruddy album with more rock but I still do not own this album because of the disco junk on it!"
2,Awful,"I have bought everything KISS since becoming a fan at age 15. When I saw the album cover with them larger than life, I thought cool more fantastic KISS. I am not a fan of Disco then or now, and I listened to this and was broken hearted. It was some of the worst crap I have ever heard. Charisma is the only decent song on it. I had not listened to this in a long time so I did the MP3 download to see if time changed anything. I still hate Disco and I still do not like this one, but being a loyal KISS fan I own it. The best version of I Was Made For Loving You is on Alive 3. Paul Stanley growls it up so it is not so disco like. I would not recommend this one if you want a taste of KISS. Instead, go back to the beginning, up through Love Gun, and you will not be disappointed. Pick them up again with Creatures of the Night and beyond."
1,Kissco,WHYY???????????This album sent Kiss into the gutters for years. It was made for the wrong reasons. Kiss was always the anti-disco and they did this. I wouldn't recomend this album if your looking for rightous rock.The only reason it deserves 1 star is because of Ace and his kick ass playing.
3,jsm1992,"Dyasty has some great songs, but Revenge is the only real KISS album that hss been made since 1977. I had great hopes for Psycho Circus, but it just isn't the same."
5,GREAT DYNASTY,"ONE OF KISS'S COMP BEST ALBUMS, EVERY TRACK IS GREAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE AWESOME SHM AUDIO FORMAT. MUST HAVE FOR ANY CD COLLECTION, BUT DON'T PAY THESE RIDICULOUS OVER-INFLATED RIP OFF PRICES, I BOUGHT MINE FROM THE MUSIC SPECIALIST ON E BAY, SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF CASH.CHEERS!"
4,End of An Era,"This is the last KISS album with all four original members on vocals. Peter wanted out of the rock 'n roll lifestyle that had come to torment him and was filled in by David Letterman's Anton Fig. Ace meanwhile is in fine form, with lead vocals on three tracks. I Was Made for Loving You was their highest charting single to date. This is an attempt at being legitimate musicians. Key tracks are: I Was Made for Loving You, Dirty Living, Save Your Love and Magic Touch. To many, this is viewed as a sell out, trying to go mainstream with a disco- ish sound. As such, this is an album KISS fans either love or hate. New to KISS I would recommen Alive, Alive II and this Dyanasty to get a feel of their overall sound. Most of their 80s albums only have one or two noteworthy songs. This is the KISS formula reinvented."
3,not your typical kiss album,"This was recorded at the height of disco mania and I guess kiss figured ""hey we can do this"" and gave it a shot. Bad idea. A good opening song, ""I was made for loving you"" that got pretty high on the charts. Peter didn't play drums on this album....(get ready for a long story folks) since this was the first album after the solo albums and Peter was ready to quit, the guys said ""to show you how much we want you in the band, we will use your producer that you used for the solo album"". It turned out that the producer (Vinie Poncetia) didn't think Peter was good enough to play on a kiss album and peter got so mad he smashed a mirrow with his hand and dagamged his hand badly. You hear Anton Fig on drums but Peter sings some. There is more than one good song on here but its to ""disco-pop"" to be a good album. Don't get it unless you have to have everything kiss (like me)."
3,Has Some Good Moments.,"Dynasty isn't bad, but on the whole it's quite average. There are interesting things here and there. ""Sure Know Something"" would have to be the best track on this collection. The production of this album doesn't sound bad either. Some other okay tracks are ""Magic Touch"" and ""X-ray Eyes."" This isn't a bad album."
4,Much Better Than The Reviews!!,"This is one of Kiss's most underrated records (The ""murky"" sounding Hotter Than Hell also vastly underrated) For all who love to bash Kiss for their ""simplistic"" song writing creativity must realize that much of their ""70's"" material has been the foundation for many modern rockers. Comparing the influence that Kiss has had is a joke compared to, say, Led Zeppelin.......but many of their records, including Dynasty, are classics!! The remake of 2000 man (Rolling Stones) and the Genes""s classic Charsima are two stand-outs on an otherwise good record. This certainly is not their heaviest album....but Kiss has proven that they can experminent with a different sound and still be successful."
3,Album reflects what the band was going through...,"There's no need to analyze this album. It's hardly stellar when compared with previous ones. These guys had all but broken up, and the quality of the songs show that. ""Sure Know Something"", ""Hard Times"", and ""Charisma"" are the only decent tracks here. I don't give a sh@# about ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"". As an ex-KISS fanatic, I think that they're desire to keep the money rolling in and 'stay current' were reasons why they 'sank' to this level. Ace Frehley and Peter Criss are average musicians, and in Peter's case, a below average songwriter. Ace's guitar playing was perfect for KISS, but wouldn't cut it in Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, or Lynyrd Skynyrd, to name just a few. This album marked KISS' (inadvertent) admission that their best songs/albums were behind them. The last 25 or so years have been about making money on those albums previous to Dynasty. Sorry, I guess some analysis was needed."
4,A New Approach,"This album is not the start of the ""supposed"" Kiss decline that many seem to harp on about.True, this album is not as good as those that came before it.However,I refuse to accept that Kiss ever went out of their way to make a ""disco"" album.Using Vinnie Ponica as producer gave DYNASTY a pop sheen and yeilded a worldwide hit with ""I Was Made For Lovin'You"".Ace's songs are the strongest of the bunch;""2000 Man"" being the highlight.Paul's songs are on target once again.Gene,unfortunately,gets only two chances to show his scales.Peter plays on only one track;his ""Dirty Livin'"".Anton Fig plays on the rest of the album.If you are a true Kiss fan you'll understand what this album really is . . .a new approach to a classic formula."
5,dynasty,"yeah this album had ""i was made for loving you"" and i remember it being a pretty big hit. but the rest of the album is straight rock and not ""disco"". they would make that mistake with the next album."
2,Ultra-ProTripod - Problem - handle broke first time!,"First time I used this tripod I noticed quick that it was not for me. I have used bogens (which are much more expensive) for years. I wanted a back-up tripod and thought this might do.. The handle broke off first time I used it and the head was very loose and wobbled. Mabye I just got a defective, but will not do this again. Stay with bogen!"
5,amazing book,very indepth guide for yoga instructors to bring in the science of this art..would recommend to any yoga instructor who wants to deepen there knowledge of this ancient practice
3,It has its moments.,"I like the earthy quality of playing on this CD. Beethoven is naturally heavy in his orchestrations, so the more vigorous the performance, the better. There is something appealing about how Walter attacks the louder, faster passages in the first two movements. I was ultimately disappointed in the second movement, however, with the less-than distinct tympani. The sudden attack needs to be sharp and clear.But what ultimately kills the recording is the entrance of the baritone soloist in the finale. I couldn't get over the rapid-fire vibrato, reminiscent of the Mayor of Munchkinland. I considered this the point of no return, and sadly had to bypass this recording altogether."
3,Modestly informative,"This bio of Ike is OK, but doesn't add much new info if you've read Deep Blues or other bios of blues players. Ike was a major player in blues, which this book clearly delineates, and he shows up in the careers of many if not most of the major players: Muddy, Wolf, BB, Bobby, and of course Tina. I chose to read this rather than his autobiography because Ike is a musician, not a writer. Not sure whether I'd learn more from the auto-bio or not. All in all, a decent read, has a very good discography, and if you don't know much about the history of Ike Turner, a good place to start. No sugar coating. A reasonably honest appraisal of one of the most important blues artists who ever lived."
1,They need to pay you to watch this.,This movie is horrible.The actors who are white Caucasians have voices that seem to be dubbed.The movie is cheaply and horribly made to the point where you see a zombie bite a shoulder and remove clear plastic that's suppose to be skin.This is should be a .99 cent movie or free to watch not a 2.99$ rentalDont waste your damn money.Its not even hilarious to watch cause of the price you have to pay to rent it.Its so horrible I couldn't even sit threw the hole thing.
2,Even the zombies fell asleep,Ok or so-so story line - bad acting - Even the zombies fell asleep yes Even the zombies fell asleep
1,This sucks.,"Perhaps it is an intentionally bad movie, but the pacing is slow, and ten minutes into it they already had called a woman a ""slut"". Maybe it's trying to be irreverent, but I just found it boring."
1,Just Annoying,"This movie has both bad camera work (VERY bad) and actors who seem to lack any training whatsoever. Just watching several minutes of it made my head hurt. Intensive acting lessons, anyone?"
5,Jennifer is an amazing woman!!!,"When I was told this book is a real ""page turner"" I kinda scoffed. I'm tired of the Titanic-mania and another book on the subject didn't interest me, but I have had the honor to know both Jennifer and Joel, well before I had any idea they were so adventuresome and talented, so I thought I'd give it a try. What a story!! It goes well beyond your everyday ""Titanic"", and brings you insights to what it would be like to go down to 12,000' in a titanium tube. I really couldn't put it down."
2,"Battered Housewife Changes Mates, Takes a Dive","I can never get enough of that Titanic stuff. But in these battered housewives stories, you always wonder why it takes so long for the woman to realize she is marrying a creep, or has married one. And though I saw it coming, I was still surprized at her loot the Titanic attitude."
3,MiXed Results,"Like most of the HEAR Music collections this is a mixed bag. But, with Rufus Wainwright, Leonard Cohen, David Byrne & Ryan Adams, this collection is better than most."
4,Almost perfect,"I saw this product recommended in a PopPhoto magazine review but was unwilling to pay the $90-100 websites were asking for it. After a few weeks of visiting Amazon, I found it for $58 with free shipping. The tripod arrived on time and undamaged. My only criticism is that it is bigger than some folks would want. Also, there is a slight grinding sound/feel when I pan then head all the way around. I am warned to not lubricate so I am hoping this will work itself out. Absolutely the best and tallest tripod available for the money. I would/do recommend this Sunpak tripod."
3,Good for three years,"My Sunpak worked fine for two years. I used it to mount a small video camera (Canon DC 50) and shoot football video's of High School Games. This year I took it out of storage yesterday. When setting it up, one of the legs fell off. The restraint holding each leg in place is a cheap piece of plastic. It brook. I did not apply any great force other than just letting the leg to drop. Beside that, the quick release plate was a great feature."
3,Broke When Arrived,Arrived in a perfect shipping box but the product box was crushed & the tripod leg was broke. This had to be like this before it was packed for shipping. Return was a hassle because the person couldn't speak english & sent the incorrect return email.
4,Fun For Kids,Mickey and Goofy are off to find some gold and learn somethingsabot mining as well. This is a great story with enough adventurefor the young one. The book has colorful illustrations andchildren can hear different Wild West sounds when they see acertain picture such as a horse or cow and they push thepicture on the side of the book to hear it. The children seemto enjoy being able to interact with the reading. Very well done.
3,"Delta 50-765 5 Horsepower 4-Bag 4,800 CFM Dust Collector, 230-Volt 1 Phase","Sorry, but I haven't even opened the box yet. In process of building a wood shop and bought the dust collector early because of the excellent Amazon price.I'm sure I will like it from what I have read.Update Sept 2007I now have my shop built and have my dust collector attached to my two most dust/chip producing tools, 16"" sander and thickness plainer. Once I get my interior walls up, I will run it all around my shop. It works great but of course with something with this much power it is pretty noisy. This is a temporary problem because I plan on putting up a partion in my 30 x 60 building, half being woodshop, and will be putting the dust collector outside of my woodshop. Putting the dust collector together was pretty simple, but it does take 2 people. Wiring was also real simple. Good directions. Thanks for the great deal on a great piece of equipment."
3,Not What is Pictured,"I recently purchased this item thinking it was three(3) faceplates in a single package since three color faceplates are shown. My purchase was filled by Endless Variety Customer Support not Ritz (do not know if they are the same). When I contacted them because I only received a single faceplate I was told the price was for one(1) faceplate and the color shipped was random. They also said they would fix this ad, but it is now more than 2 weeks since they said they would fix the ad and I still see 3 faceplates in the picture and nowhere do I see it clearly stated that it will only be a SINGLE random color facepplate you receive for the price."
2,DVD review,"clarity and color and definition are all good, but the program itself is a disappointment. if you have tivo, use that instead."
4,It Finally Gets To The Point,"The beginning of the documentary seemed to focus too much on Congresswoman McKinnie; as though she was the face of voter disenfranchisement in the U.S. I believe the documentary made its strongest points when it focused on the bigger picture of the government's attempts to inhibit the citizenry's right to vote. Especially powerful was the evidence of the state of Ohio's alleged fraud against the citizens in Colombus. After a slow beginning, the documentary ends on a powerful, emotional note. Overall, worth watching."
5,This woman has guts!,"Great, great, great! Cynthia McKinney is intelligent, she has integrity, and boy does she have guts. I wish she was my representative. Boy would I be proud. I pray to God that she keeps fighting for truth, justice, and the American way. Courageous to the core!"
4,American Blackout,American BlackoutAmerican BlackoutAn insiteful and painfully honest view of the political state of our nation. Reccomended for anyone who desires to open their eyes before the crash.
2,Uneven and sometimes inaccurate,"This book is very thorough on certain subjects, too much so in fact. It repeatedly gives instructions for procedures that anyone studying Enterprise should already KNOW (such as creating an NT boot disk and creating user accounts). Other areas are incomplete, including subjects touched on in the testing software.The last third of the book was not very well edited, and there are numerous typos.The testing software on the CD did not record all of my answers properly, at least one ""correct"" answer was wrong, and several questions referenced pages in the book that did not give information pertaining to the correct answer.This book might be a good introduction for NT Server in general, but do not rely on this alone for the Enterprise exam! (And don't buy a book on the strength of ONE review)"
1,Not the same gun....,"I had this gun before which I purchased 10 years ago. THAT previous gun is a viking - still going strong today. The new version, which I just purchased, is an absolute piece of crap and I would not recommend it to anyone. The only reason 1 star is selected is because 0 star is not an option."
1,Rat Pack,"The poster came in with several wrinkles and was useless to me.I needed the poster for a gift and I ended up giving something else, since i was embarrased to give something in such a bad shape."
5,Can't wait for the next one!,"I heard a cut from this CD on satellite radio. WOW! So I bought this and found their previous two CD's and bought those, too. What a welcome change from the normal rehashed ""processed cheese"" that passes, lately, for C-Jazz. Inventive, upbeat, great mixture of different (well played) instruments and (here's the best part) each cut rides on a different mood and sound. Even the few slower tracks are tastefully done and fresh. Tired of a whole CD's worth of mind-numbing, synthesized repetition? Check this one out! (And, BONUS, you get a cool sampler CD as well.) Keep 'em coming, guys!"
2,Unhappy customer,"I bought the guitar from my son. He loved it at Christmas. However, the strings were always moving out of the slots. Therefore it needed to be tightened. When tightened the whole neck of the guitar broke!! The guitar did not last long at all:("
1,Bad luck,"This toy was terrible. My son was thrilled to receive it, but the strings broke in no time at all and now he has lost interest. I have to say I wouldn't recommend this guitar."
2,Quick to rust...,I received this set as a gift and was very excited to use them. They seemed rather nice right out of the package but after the first wash in the dishwasher they started to rust and it all went downhill from there. I got so aggravated that I ended up buying a completely different set. If you're up for washing and drying these by hand then they might be for you.
5,Stamper,Just what I ordered and needed. Wasn't sure about the order they never asked what I wanted on it when I ordered. But I was sent another email for the details. Fast service. Very satisfied
2,Since when do phone numbers have 11 digits?,"I was kinda ticked when I unpacked this item, tested it and found an extra digit tacked onto the end of my phone number! I went to the email I sent them to make sure I didn't make a typo, and my info was in order. Somehow they put an extra number after my 10-digit phone number. Knowing it would be a hassle to return, etc...I simply got out my exacto knife and chopped it off! Now at least I can use it, but the phone number will always be off-center by one digit! 2 stars for the lack of attention to detail and poor quality control."
4,Nice Stamp!,Overall this self-inking stamp does a good job. I feel it is a good value for what we had to pay for it.
4,Rubber stamp does the trick,Way better than return address labels. Be sure to rock back and forth a little to ensure it stamps completely
5,Easy and fast,"Any time I need a self-inking stamp I will always purchase them from this company. Ordering is easy, the prices are excellent, and the stamp ships quickly. I have ordered seven stamps so far and all have been great, just exactly what I needed and the customization has always been correct. Awesome!"
4,Super happy,"I'm super happy with this stamp. It was very inexpensive and it works like a charm. I give it four stars, because i have to wiggle it up and down to make sure the entire stamp appears on the page. But for this price, i'm not complaining!"
3,Fades In Spots,"Print not consistant,fades in certain spots.Ink takes a while to dry,not the greatest for glossy paper.It does the job but could be better."
4,Good book,"This was a good, well written book, but I expected more about the adoption. It was more about the author's life during that time, with the adoption thrown in."
2,This CD isn't so great,"Overall, this CD is so so. The first movement of Symphony no. 25 has a lot of squeaky violins and that makes it hard to listen to. It also only lasts 4'42 and the other recordings that I've heard were usually at least 7 minutes long. The fourth movement is a bit slow. I'm not too familiar with Symphony no. 28. It sounds okay. the first movement seems a bit short. It's about 4 minutes long. Symphony no. 29 doesn't sound too bad. Like Symphony no. 25, the first movement is about 3 minutes shorter than usual. The last selection on this CD, the ""Haffner"" symphony, is performed the best. It is a good performance, but it cannot compare to the live performance given by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra during this past season. Like the other symphonies, the first movement of this one is also a few minutes shorter than usual. I wouldn't recommend this CD because all 4 of the symphonies have the repeats taken out."
4,As told to me by my wife...,"I bought this book for my wife. She was delighted to get the book, a little surprised I remembered. She knew about the subject matter before I ordered it. After I catch up on all the other books on my Kindle, I'll read it, too, and share my thoughts on the book."
5,Where can i get this cd or cassette?,"This is a great recording by George Burns. My Mom would love it for her 75th birthday but i can't find it anywhere. If you know anywhere, please respond. Thanks."
2,Not very durable,"My weimeraner ripped the Frisbee apart within just a few minutes- If your dog like to chew or shake the toys in her/his mouth, then you should not waste your money."
1,Orbee-Tuff Zoom Flyer,Not so tuff. If your dog is an avid chewer do let him play with this without supervision. My dog chew this flyer up in no time.
2,Tough as a rock and flies like one too.,"This dog disc is very durable, but it flies poorly. The outer ring is made from very tough and somewhat soft rubber. The problem is that this rubber is a bit floppy and quite heavy. The floppiness makes it hard to throw accurately. The heavy weight makes the disc sink quickly, which makes it very hard for the dog to catch it. The Hyperflite 'Jawz' discs are about the same price and work MUCH better. They are also nearly indestructible, but they fly great too."
2,fairly flimsy and doesnt hold its glow,"The glow in the dard rubber on the outside of this frisbee is very soft and floppy. This makes it hard to throw and very attractive to must dogs to chew on. This is probably not why you would purchase a frisbee. Also, it doesnt glow for more than a few minutes once it enters darkness and you actually need it, even if you ""charge"" it before you go out. However, this is pretty typical for these types of things. I always look for something with an LED if I need it to really glow in the dark."
4,Planet Dog Makes Awesome Toys,"The planet dog toys are always a favorite for my Golden, and while this flyer is a lot of fun for fetching, he prefers discs that he can bend and wrap around a tennis ball so that he can carry both around. The orange piece in the middle is a hard rubber, while the blue is flexible, so it isn't as bendy as the other disks we've bought."
1,sucks,Didnt even work for a hour without blowing up an was powered by 50∅ watts so i would not recommend this as a sub
3,not that good,Bought two of theese subs they do hit hard but a lot of distortion in the speaker I would rather save the money & buy alpine .
4,good sub not 1200 watts,"ok installed without a problem hits ok but i have this hooked up to a sony explode 1000 watt amp, amp is not even turned up to half after i turn it up head unit past volume lvl 18 it starts to crackle no way it is rated for 1200 watts more like 700watts just so u know..."
4,Great bass for the price.,"This speaker really takes the power well. I was looking for a little extra bass and was amazed at the sound I got from this Lanzar. If you are looking for a good speaker at a very low price, this is the speaker for you."
4,a great buy FOR THE $,@ first i was concerned about the cheesy foam surrounds i mean theese surrounds feel like the same foam the speakers were shipped in. after installation however theese lanzars hit just fine great low end response im just not sure how long they will last with the packing foam surrounds
3,okay subs. not really good,"i used these ina customers 2002 ram 1500 and made a under seat sub box. these are not loud at all, i have a 2000 watt amp pushing these at 1000 watts a piece and the arent loud, you can feel them move a bit but not what a sub should do."
4,Won't Disappoint,"I've known of Lanzar for years and always thought of them as one of those sleeper brands. While everyone buys kicker and fosgate, I'll save money and get better sound by buying Lanzar. I bought these subs to replace a pair of Kenwoods. I wanted a sub that hit lower and could handle my amps full load. Amp is a Hifonics HFI1000.1D wired down to 2ohms approx 750watts, but gains only at 65%. Speakers handle it just fine and blows those Kenwoods away. The lows shake and the higher bass hits. Owners manual doesn't specify RMS powr handling, but in most cases it's 40-50% of the max. Definitely worth every penny, and won't disappoint!"
3,Initial review upon first inspection,As the title says this is just a initial review upon receipt. I Purchased this and a Lanzar HTG257 from Vm Inovations and I was not really pleased with the way it was shipped just in its original packaging.As for the sub itself it has a good weight from it due to the magnets but beside that the build quality feels very cheap. The cone and foam surrounds are okay for a budget speaker but the rubber shroud or cap that covers the magnet and terminal could be much better. The shroud although thick isn't a snug fit and feels loose but the real downer are the terminals they feel so cheap like they would break if to much pressure is applied. I am still holding out final judgment until i place it in a box and break it in. The price is very reasonable and if it performs I guess my score will be swayed to match. By the way the speaker comes with box specs on a small leaflet for sealed and ported enclosures. Sealed was a min of 0.33cuft and a max of 0.75cuft
4,Real funky and a little freaky at the same time.,"Leon recorded some pretty funky songs during the 70's decade. It's really unfortunate that this cd is out of print because i really dig some of these tunes. ""I wanna do something freaky to you"" is pure classic. I remember hearing this cut when it first came out. Of course i was pretty young at the time, but it still stood out. They need to go on and re-release this greatest hits so the people can have access to it once again. It's available here on Amazon.com, but hell, the sellers want a lot of money for it."
5,Amazing,Product arrived without delay and proved to be everything as promised.I would buy this again.
3,"bad motor, but great product","This is a really great product. I had a lot of fun nights, but I was really sad when the motor seemed to stopped running. Besides that, it was very good. The varias pulses are pretty week, but there is also an option for a different vibration speeds and those can be pretty intense. This thing is pretty loud, beware."
2,"OK for beginners, but not as a reference.","This book does an OK job in explaining the language for a beginner. However, it falls short with the details of the language. I had accidentally left the book at the school, right after the exam, and didn't go back to pick it up (even though I was only a block away). If I end up needing a book, I will try to find a better reference book."
2,Not a useful book for learning and reference,"This is not the kind of book that you want to keep on your bookshelf for future reference. It comes with relatively poor index, examples, and structure. It's always hard to find useful information from this book when you want to find something for reference. I'll go for other Verilog books."
1,A poorly organized book.,"Whenever you want find something from the book, chances are you can't find it. Moreover, some chapter go to too details while others not enough. Would not recommend to buy if you do want learn Verilog."
2,Not a good reference,"I found this book too academic, with not enough references to topics that are important to actual engineers designing code. It touches on the important stuff, but doesn't delve into nearly enough detail. Too much of the book (2 big chapters) is devoted to going through a single example design for a microprocessor, instead of going through multiple smaller designs which could give a better overview of the possible language constructs.The most serious problem, in my opinion, is that the index is terrible. I find what I want only about 50% of the time. Try looking up how to invert a signal, for example. It's not under NOT, Invert, or anything else you might think of.Otherwise, the book does provide some useful information. Still, I think my money would have been better spent elsewhere..."
2,terrible reference,"I guess your opinion of this book depends on what you are looking for. If you are a professional engineer who already knows design with HDL and needs a verilog reference source then stay away. It is not organized as a reference book. If you want a text to read to explain to you the HDL design process with verilog as the language that happens to be used, then this book could be useful. Unfortunately, I am the former and this book is nearly useless to me. I can get my question answered on the verilog newsgroup faster than I can find it in this."
2,Still searching for a good book on Verilog!,"Where do I start? I was looking for a well-written, well-illustrated, well-organized, example-rich, pertinent guide to writing synthesizeable Verilog code. This book scores low on all of those fronts. Perhaps there are engineers who find this book useful, but if you design sequential logic, heavy with state machines and data flows, such as those found in digital communication systems, you won't be happy with this book. It is more of an academic guide than a practical engineer's guide."
2,Not a very good book,This book concentrates too much on how to write code. It does not provide in-depth knowledge of the subject.
3,Good choice for Verilog begginners,Good book concerning verilog basic concepts. Very useful for the begginner student. CD-ROM is also useful thus contains all the code that is in the book pages.
5,Bringin it Strong,All I have to say is Downset Rocks and They're touring with Slayer right now and they rock hard. I wanna say Whats up to the new drummer Chris Hamilton. Yo Chris Bring it Live From Pennsylvania. Ron says Whats Up. Ron Neff kicks it on the drums and Chris Rips it Too. Downset is Great. Deadbolt Still Rocks and Chris. Ron And I love you and Rock Mad Heads.. With much love Ron And Mike... Bike Line Coatesville Pa..
5,amazing rap-core from the heart,these guys rock they have a real heavy sound and the vocals are real rappy but positive. it song has its own personality it really tells alot they bring it straight from the heart and i wish more people would sound like them for real. buy this albulm
3,God's blessing was paid in full by Jesus see Romans 8:32,"I'm not against tithing just the distortion of what is being taught to the Christian Churches that our favor and blessings from God rest on our own works (tithing). This makes for much boasting (bragging). However, no one will find one verse to Gentiles under the New Covenant of Grace that requires believers pay God for his gift of daily Grace (FAVOR). Jesus died on the Cross and said ""Paid in Full"". I wish the Author had conveyed that he understood what Jesus meant when he said Paid in Full, It is Finished."

3,"A balanced narrated slide show of works, but short","A narrated (often by quotes from Vincent's letters to Theo) slide show of Van Gogh's works interlaced with illustrating them video clips, but without expert interview-like commentaries directly spoken from the screen. The selection of works is well balanced between all periods of his 10 year long carrier including his early works not shown else illustrating the development of Van Gogh's talent. Seems to be slightly inferior to the 1997 ""Biography - Vincent Van Gogh: A Stroke of Genius"" by A&E.;CONTENTS:Chapters1. Introduction2. Early Years3. Landscapes of Drenthe and Nueflen4. The Potato Eaters5. Study Sketches and Townscapes6. The Paris Years7. Self-portrait8. The Town of Aries9. The Yellow House10. Paintings Done While in the Asylum11. Final Works of Auvers-sur-Oise12.

5,Fabulous Rhapsodies,"The two Bartok Rhapsodies, (and the 2nd Concerto of Bartok along with his recording of the Berg) are considered by most good violinists I know to be the pinnacle of the legacy of this somewhat erratic genius.There are better recordings of the Prokofiev (marginally - these are terrific, too) but no better Rhapsodies. They are fabulous. And I doubt that they'll ever be surpassed because the current crop of children can't play.Grab this one before it gets deleted."
2,Go elsewhere for the Prokofiev,"This recording of the Prokofiev concerti dates from late in Stern's career. Unfortunately, there is little to enjoy in it. For these wonderful concerti get the Gil Shaham (DGG) recording or, even better dig up a copy with Nathan Milstein or Shlomo Mintz as soloist.The Bartok Rhapsodies are this disc's savior (and the only reason I haven't consigned it to the used CD bin). Full orchestral and violinistic color are smeared across the sound waves exactly as Bartok himself intended. Wonderful.That said, if the Bartok has been released elsewhere, get it there. The Prokofiev concerti are immeasurably dissapointing."

5,"Beautifully written, inspiring, timeless... quality children's literature.","This is such a beautifully written book, with amazing illustrations. Written and illustrated by Johnny Gruelle for his daughter Marcella, this is a collection of stories about her dolls, and their magical adventures. My 9 and 5 year old both adore this book, inspiring creative, imaginative play. If you are raising your children to be sensitive, creative, thoughtful, respectful, and are trying to avoid unintelligent, poorly written, corporate driven garbage that fills bookstore shelves, you will love this book. As for any ""politically incorrect"" passages, (I have yet to find any, perhaps in other Johnny Gruelle books), I have found it is a good opportunity to talk with my children about it - kids get it. But if your kids have been raised on video games, television, and need to be bombarded with stimulation in order to maintain interest, they will definitely be bored. This book is a treasure."
4,Great way to hear the stories,"These are well produced/read versions of the classic stories. A bit ""old"" for my 2 year olds, as it didn't hold their intrest as well as some others we have purchased. (Hence the 4 starts) I'd say it's a 5 star for older kids who may be familiar with the stories already.NOTE: the age of the stories and the ""mind set"" from the time they were written may offend some, they are not the ""Politically Correct"" stories of today; can been seen as slightly racist, as are many stories from that time."
1,REview of Raggedy Ann Book,I was very disappointed in the book. It had been wet at some point. The pages were rippled.
1,Very disappointing book,"Very disappointed in this book; maybe I didn't 'read' what I was getting, but it was not at all what I expected"
3,"Charming stories, but then there's Dinah, remember?","I'd have to agree that the stories are charming from an adult perspective. However, as in many pieces of classic literature the representation of the African-American maid ""Dinah"" working for a extra white family is pretty bad. In this particular collection Dinah appears only once, but there is an illustration replete with head wrap, laundry wringer, and extra large lips. Dinah is also the only character who gets the colloquial speech..""Jess lemme hang Miss Raggedy on de line in de bright sunshine foh haff an hour.."". Since she only appears in one story it is avoidable - but it's there. Buyer beware."
5,Hydrogen Hawaii is excellent,"This DVD is excellent. It shows how hydrogen may be the future for energy, once issues such as safety and distribution, are well resolved."
4,only one down fall....,"this was actually a great buy. we're even planning on buying seasons 3 and 4 for our son's 3rd birthday. the show is a great one and is full of child compatable energy...but like my title says there was only one downfall and that is after watching them about 3 dozen times in a mo. my husband and i have grown quite bored with it...therefore we make 5 stars to 4 (for our sanity), even though our son has not. so yes he's still loving it...so it's really quite worth it.-mommy Kroener"
1,damaged dvd's,"I was very disappointed with this order. My grandaughter was too. Charlie and Lola are her favorite show. When we put the dvd's in they skipped. We tried them in three different dvd players. They skipped in all three. I would like to get them replaced, but am not sure how to go about it."
2,UNKNOWN CODE! CAREFUL.,"I bought the volume one, and if it comes from Australia, beware that it will NOT play in your regular DVD. This was very disapointing to me. This is however my daughter's favorite show on Disney Channel and I will definitely buy this collection once I know it will be rated CODE 1, as this is the only one that will play here in the United States (or Canada)."
4,"Charlie and Lola, Vols. 1 and 2","We found these collections of British videos to be whimsical and delightful. Most importantly, our 4 1/2 year old son loves them. They all start the same, ""I have this little sister Lola. She is small and very funny"" That is about the only predictable thing as the two children use their imagination and their affection for each other to deal with life's issues, like not being able to check out your favorite library book, getting a little kid to eat her dinner, putting to bed a little child and so on. The BBC has a nice interactive web site that interfaces nicely with the books and videos. Enjoy!"
5,Best children's cartoon,Charlie and Lola is one of the best children's cartoons. It does a fantastic job of teaching sibling leadership while tackling issues such as finicky eating and going to bed.
5,"Excellent, clean, and wholesome entertainment for children.",This was the beginning of a wonderful set of children's cartoons. It will teach children how to play and use their imaginations while keeping them entertained. It will also teach them a good sense of family. I love how the big brother is so doting towards Lola.
5,Good Family Laugh,"The kids and I enjoy Charlie and Lola so much. I love that they are only 15 minutes each too. They are so fun to laugh with! My brothers who don't have children yet don't really enjoy them, I think it is a requirement to be on the same level with small children to really enjoy the humor."
5,"Everyday Life, yet sweeter","Charlie and Lola keep my 4-year-old magically entertained withOUT the drama, romance, scary villains, children or animals in peril, or potty jokes of other DVDs unbelievably aimed at her age group. It may seem really simple and low-key, but she laughs out loud, talks about episodes days later and wants to watch it again and again. The sweetness and sincerity of watching Charlie reach out his arms to a weepy Lola for a reassuring hug is enough to sell you. Parents are never seen nor heard, but they are talked about, loved and obeyed. Along with ""Harold and the Purple Crayon"", these are my favorite kids' DVDs."
2,Good For One's Aerobic Workout...,"But, sadly, that is the extent of the CD's value! Basically this is a compilation of fairly routine dance remixes, featuring two classic jams (""Finally"" by Ce Ce Peniston and ""I Feel Love"" by disco queen Donna Summer) and the rest being familiar solely to the club crowd."
3,Dance Around,"Ok, this cd is ok. My favorite song on it is 100% Pure Love. The reason being it has a good beat and can be a song for a dance. The other songs are ok but not as good."
3,This could have been so great,"The stunning visuals are ruined by the jarring and incongruent modern musical score which is dominated by droning rock rhythms that fail horribly to sync with the motion on screen. I recommend watching it with the sound turned OFF, or accompanied by a Jazz CD from the era of the film. It is hard to comprehend why anyone would choose to mar this classical footage by paring it with such an inappropriate soundtrack. Modern music could have worked beautifully if it had been done with any sensitivity to the piece itself, and written to accompany and support the segments of the film."
3,"Jazz, 1927, Paris","For Jazz lovers, francophiles, nightclubbers. Has some early Josephine Baker, making this DVD worthy of purchase for any of her fans."
5,What a great book!,My husband and I discovered 'The Art of Natural Building' on a plane to Spain! A passenger next to us was reading a copy & we asked to borrow it: it was so fantastic that we ordered it for a builder friend of ours who works in natural materials as much as possible. He is thrilled with it!
5,Fetilizer Starter Kit,This product is very successful and very helpful for all your growing needs. I recommend this product to everybody that loves to grow plants. I will purchase many more times.
1,Disappointed,"The kit seems like a nice starter kit, however, 2 of the 3 large bottles leaked all over. I don't know if I got a new package since no bottles were sealed except for the rooting gel. Anytime I've bought liquid plant food, the bottles always have a safety seal. So either I got someone's used / returned product and had a leak during shipping, or the manufacturer doesn't seal this stuff which is disappointing. If the product was sealed, I would have given it 5 stars as it seems like a nice kit, with included instructions."
2,Meh,"Frstly the rooting gel did not work at all. i pulled the clone out of the medium when i was sure it was not going to grow, no root sprouts in a week and a half. Secondly there are many things to mix, even with the simple recipe it was still alot to do. Would highly recommend a higher grade, simpler recipe, and defiantly spring for the top of the line rooting gel. IMO. Good luck."
5,Amazing!,"My sister, when she first moved out, bought this poster and I always loved it! So, when I finally found it online at Amazon, I was super stoked! Especially since it was the cheapest price I could find. I love this poster, and Amazon. :-)"
5,a classic,"By now this book is a classic, the best around for basic alternative photographic processes. I used this book as a student and then again as a teacher. It is easy to use, thorough, and not the least bit intimidating. Any one who can follow a recipe can make some really fun images with this book."
2,How the RICH she really does it...,"Sure if you're Vera Wang or Bobbi Brown or Ann Curry any other famous or wealthy mom profiled in this book, this might be the book for you. Otherwise, if you're a hard working mother who HAS to go back to a traditional job that doesn't bend around your fame and fortune this book is useless. There are no helpful tips whatsoever. Just not-so-poignant accounts of rich NYC area women who, often times, quit their real pre-baby jobs to start knitting companies or freelance. I was shocked that the author herself quit her job to write the book - hardly a stay-at-work perspective. Save your money for the extra latte that most of us real working moms need!"
2,"Boring, fluffy and no concrete tips...","What a disappointment... Every chapter reads the same and there is not one true ""take-away"" that working moms can use... Meanwhile most of the mothers interviewed are high-profile execs who can probably hire nannies, etc. Not reality at all..."
1,Read only if you areVera Wang or Ann Curry,"All (or at least most) of the women interviewed for this book have extraordinary careers. And most of them live in NYC or somewhere similiar. If you are an attorney, banker, etc. or if you live in a midsize city, I really don't think that this book offers much insight and virtually no advice.If you are looking for a book that will lift your spirits, offer some practical advise and inspire you to have a fresh outlook, I suggest ""Balance is a Crock, Sleep is for the Weak"""
1,creepy,"This book made my skin crawl. And made me so, so happy that I stay home with my kids and no longer have to work with people like this author."
4,"Walter: Brahms 4th Tragic Overture, Schicksalslied","Brahms is my favorite composer. Brahms was concerned that he followed Beethoven, so much so that he waited until late in life to publish his symphonies. I do not understand why. The Fourth is a masterpiece.The performances of these pieces by Bruno Walter and the Columbia Symphony are also masterful.The technology for the initial recording is dated, but the remastering was done with great care. The result is a really fine recording."
4,Maniac Madness,"I've never heard the story of Maniac Magee, and I decided to begin reading it without reading the summary of the story located on the back. I was pleasantly surprised with its soft humor, and I thoroughly enjoyed its tall tale like description of Magee's abilities. I loved this book. It was heart warming, enteretaining, and showed that a child's innocence can mend the broken bridge between races that ignorance causes."
4,"Jeffrey looks at two sides of town, and wants to stop raciss","Jeffrey Magee's parents die, so he goes to live with his aunt and uncle. Later, he moves out of their house and sees both sides of town, and wants to stop racissim."
5,"""Maniac"" opens the forum for many sensitive social issues.",I first read this book as a Children's lit. student. I found it to be such a valuable resource that I was eager to include it in my curriculum. There are many websites dedicated to this book. Explore and learn more....
2,:(,IMHO: Absolutely boring book if you are not a specialist on the topic.The language/style is heavy and hard to follow.
5,The hit songs for a reasonable price,"This is a great little Richard sampler that covers his middle period, and some later period, these are msotly hits, and thier is a great interview with Little Richard at the end. This is pioneering r&b jump blues music. And all the songs are fun and wild, from the opening classic Lucille(with a horn section) to Hound Dog. You'll Love richards boogie woogie piano style and his screeching vocals(reminiscent almost of Ruth Brown at times!). Many of these songs are on the bluesy(or jump blues side). And msot of the tracks feature a big band bancking up Richard's boogie piano and vocals. GREAT CD!!!"
4,Great classic rock,"Great selection of his hits. Come on, even if he's a little strange in life, guys how many war movies have you seen where he has had a song in it. Usually a bunch of bad ass special forces types flying in on a helicopter getting dropped into the jungle...(scene from Predator comes to mind)..."
5,Little Richard,Little Richard is the most iconic rock entertainer of the 20th century. This CD has his best of best. Buy it U will like it Guaranteed.
5,Informative Book by Pioneer in Field,"An extremeley informative, clear, focused book by a pioneer in the field who covers all the bases. It's a useful tool for writers interested in new forms of storytelling. With Miller's lively writing style and illustrations, it's a great read as well!Dr. Linda Seger, Script ConsultantAuthor of MAKING A GOOD SCRIPT GREATand seven other books"
5,Digital Storytelling is the best,"Digital Storytelling by Carolyn Handler Miller is the best book in the vast field of interactive writing. After reading it I was thrilled at how informative and easy-to-understand it was for me. Miller's writing is clear and concise and will help not only the novice but the experieced professional as well. I strongly recommend Digital Storytelling for all writers who want to learn about every phase of interactive writing, plus writing in general. In fact, I consider Digial Storytelling to be the Bible in its field and a wonderful reference book to have next to your computer."
2,i was disappointed agian,i did not like the theater version and this version is not much better. so if you did not like the theater version beware you might not like this one too.
2,What is this?,"This movie in an interesting adventure. It contains some beautiful fight sequences and even has a little bit of a heart to it. In this particular version there are also a lot of interesting extras including a developing documentary and a great featurette with historical information on Jerusalem around the 12th century.Still this movie smacked of political eisegeses. Only in a Hollywood rendition of the crusades could you expect a speech on how all religions are basically the same. The movie has a ridiculous touchy feely kind of ending. No intelligent person in their right mind could ever find this propaganda historically viable. But if you are looking to kill some time, you like ""historical"" epics and great battle scenes then give this one a try. Personally I found the commentaries and extras to be far better than the movie itself."
2,Not what you're paying for!,It's a great movie but this Director's Cut is missing the other 3 discs with all the special features. Apparently it's not Amazon's fault and they wouldn't exchange it for what I wanted.
5,Kingdom of Heaven Directors Cut,much better then the original release. 50 minutes of additional footage that wasnt seen in the theater. it makes the story line so much better. this is a must buy for anyone.
3,An epic,"Kingdom of Heaven is an epic movie with an epic length. The acting is good, with many great actors. The plot and costumes are excellent and sets the stage. The battle scenes are choreographed and well shot. I'm no fan of big epics, but Kingdom was a good movie."
2,Did anyone proof the Pilgrim's Tour text???,"Amazing...the ""Pilgrim's Tour"" special feature, which provides text to go along with the movie, is full of typographical errors, sentence fragments, and slang that is quite inappropriate to the subject. ""It's"" and ""Its"" are used at random, with no concern for which is appropriate. You'd think that the budget of the DVD might have allowed forsomeone who knows the language."
3,OVERPRICED ?,"I'm really excited that FOX is finally releasing some of it's catalog titles on Blu-Ray. But these titles are exactly that catalog titles, that are priced higher than most studios day and date releases. The picture and sound quality are on par with Sony / Warner Bros. / Paramount / Disney, not any better or worse. The ""extras"" are sorely missing. I'm really getting tired of certain studios setting up for the ""double dip"" by not including the basic extras from their dvd couterparts. Yes, I did purchase this movie, but I feel cheated having to pay this much to enjoy Kingdom Of Heaven in Hi-def, when M:I:3 looks a lot better, is packed with features, and costs less. Come on Sony, Fox, & Disney step up your Hi-def game."
2,Some great actors but not Bloom's best work.,"Most of the acting is great in this film except for the lead actor Orlando Bloom. In order for this movie to be considered good, he would have had to really sell this character to the viewers but he fell far short of that and he just ended up looking moody through out the film. I could not understand or sympathize with his character at all and I just felt if Russell Crow or an actor like him had played the lead it would have been a much better film. I usually like Orlando Bloom but this role was way wrong for him!!!"
5,Amazing Movie,this is a movie with alot of standing power. its been way more than a couple of years and its still an amazing movie with amazing bluray quality. kingdom of heaven on bluray makes this movie shine soo much more. It makes having movies worth while.
5,even better the second time around,"The original cut of Kingdom of Heaven was good, but this extended edition gives a much greater insight to the characters. It is a great movie that is well worth the time and even if you have the original, you should see this version.I liked the theatrical cut of ""Heaven"" and bought it the day it hit the stores, so when I heard that there was a director's cut coming out, I wondered why bother when the original was so good. Somehow, I talked myself into purchasing the new cut and I was flabergasted. There is so much new info here that adds immeasureably to both the understanding and enjoyment of ""Heaven"". I definately reccommend this movie along with the original cut. But if you can only afford one, get this one."
4,Fantastic movie - wait for director's cut!,"I absolutely loved this movie, although the cuts to make the movie fit into a 2-hour time frame were shameful. The first time I saw it, I definitely felt something was missing. I cannot wait to view the director's cut of this movie, and fill in those missing pieces. I thought the acting, expecially Orlanda Bloom's, was second to none. Beautiful acting, beautiful movie... Don't be fooled by the box office ""failure"" - if you think you MIGHT like the movie, you absolutely should watch it."
5,Kingdom of Heaven,"I strongly recommend this movie: the cast, special effects and acting are excellent. Orlando Bloom has an exceptional performance. It is historically very accurate and objective: most of the characters were real people and the portrait of Saladin the Islamic leader is outstanding. It also presents the dualism that was the main engine for the crusades: the materialism, the bad side that we are continuously reminded in the media and the idealism: Jerusalem not as a real city but an ideal to strive for: the Kingdom of Heaven. The movie has as a background the historical clash between Islam and Christianity that started since the birth of the former and where Christianity was most on the time on the defensive until the Crusades came about. This movie is a must for people who like history, epic movies, good acting and of course Orlando Bloom."
2,Blu-Ray has none of the DVD extras.,"Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the 5 Disc DVD. Why would a studio release a film of this magnitude and incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras? Lucky I held onto the original DVD release for the extra 3 disks. Movie - A+++. Blu-Ray value - FAIL."
5,Best movie EVER of its kind,"Aside from its super excellent story, acting, production, soundtrack, and all Oscar best movie categories which I would certainly award all to this movie, I was extremely touched as a Muslim by the final scene of Saladin placing the falling Cross on the table after entering Jerusalem. What a great expression of respect.I believe this movie came at the right time, as people of different religions must learn how to live together in tolerance and peace, and I think this is what viewers should also see between the lines of the story.If this movie didn't hit, I can understand why from a political consideration and nothing else, but those who are interested in a brighter future learned from our present and past should indeed watch the movie. I guarantee to you that as much as you'll have a great deal of entertainment, you'll get also something else that would change the world."
4,Good epic but a little slow,"This was a good movie overall and I enjoyed it. However I can't give it 5 stars, almost gave it 3. It moves along very slowly and can be hard to follow. Some of the characters don't have any depth and you are only left to wonder about their motives. It's not something I would want to watch over and over again either. The battle scene is great though. People talk about the crusades as some foolish thing in the past, but try to imagine riding a horse and taking a ship over a huge distance like that to fight for something you believed in. We can only imagine."
5,Great Gift,"I got this for my older brother for Christmas and he loved it, plus he was so surprised! He absolutely was blown away by it!"
2,To be honest . . .,"This film is HORRIBLY inaccurate, historically. It is, in fact, a ""nachtmare."" The acting isn't bad, and some of the action scenes, as far as they are *just* action scenes, are good. However, the historical inaccuracy of the film is just something I cannot get around. If you like this film, I do not wish to insult you - just please, please, please . . . do NOT think this is in any way actual history, or any sort of fair to middling approximation thereof."
5,WOW! BIG WOW! See it with your Dad or Son.,"This is something else all togehter. It will not be what you expect, because no expecation can match the power this movie delivers. Who knew Orlando Bloom could act, much less be so powerful next to Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons . Save your $4 at blockbuster becasue after renting it you will want to buy it. The greatest story about becoming a man, since El Cid. For those of you struggling through with gaining your fathers approval or meeting your parents expectations, see this movie with them."
4,The price is due to the format,"This post is more geared towards the member that complained about price. I agree with what they said, but you need to blame Blu-Ray not Fox. The technology forces them to charge more since it cost a lot more to produce. HD DVD uses technology very similar to current DVD production so that format will cost less. That is one reason why HD DVD's are outselling Blu-Ray. The 10th best selling HD DVD is selling better than the 3rd best selling Blu-Ray movie. Fox and others undoubtedly will take notice to this."
2,"Hmm, 4 and 5 stars? You sure you don't work for the studio?","Seriously, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in awhile. I was really hyped up and saw it the first weekend of it's release in Theaters.The reasons:1) For me, I can only feel and get attatched to 1 char in the movie; which was the leper(Edward Norton).2) If this movie wasn't cut to pieces, then it was one of the worst put together movies I have ever seen. The movie just jumps from one scene to the next, with no rhyme or reason. It is missing alot of filler that is needed to flesh out the script.3) I actually felt jipped when leaving the movie, don't think I have ever felt that way(there are bad movies, but this set a new standard).I'm really, really hoping that there is a Director's Cut. A little redemption would go a long way in making me feel better about this film.AVOID this version, wait for Director's Cut if the rumors are true!!!!!"
4,nice one,"the BD version had a very nice and clear HD vision, it's really good about the physical side, but I am not quite like the story. it's just like other history movies."
3,"Uneven, I expected better","A good, certainly not great film.I expected more from Ridley Scott.The story kept jumping around & left you hanging about what was going on with the characters.What was the story behind Balian & Sibylla? I did not understand this side story at all.Orlando did a good job.DVD wise, I had trouble with disc 2 accessing all the features."
5,Good!,Excellent movie! Was in very good conditions!You have to take time to watch this movie! Is really awesome!:)
3,Kingdom of Heaven,"The movie was listed as the ""Directors Cut"" and was not. It turned out to be the original version which was good when it first came out, but after the real Director's Cut was released, the original version was missing so many scences that made this version only fair. The movie with the Director's Cut is excellent and I'd recommend that version and would advise anyone not to waste their money on the original version."
3,Decent enough,"Kingdom of Heaven is a decent crusade film. It's grounded just enough in reality to keep me happy, but changes enough to keep me interested, and the changes made are somewhat understandable.What's annoying is that the BD version of the director's cut does not come with ANY special features. Major disappointment. Picture quality is spectacular though."
4,Liked the movie - hated the packaging!,"I'm writing this out of frustration. I saw the ending twice on HBO - Free week-end - liked what I saw so decided to order from Amazon. The only problem is that it arrived in a double dvd pkg that I have yet to figure out how to open. There is a red plastic piece on the right side. It can neither be pushed up / down - or flipped open. I tried to force it open prying with a knife - nothing has worked. Those discs are inside for good. I'm going to Best Buy tomorrow to see if their version has this same mysterious red tab. Obviously I'm the only one who has had this issue with getting the case opened. But, as I said before, what I did get to see of the movie, (the last half hour) on hbo . . . I liked. A slice of history that even if the details are made for the movie, was enlightening about the struggles that still continue in that part of the world today."
3,Flawed Lushly Filmed Fable,"This film moves in the same vein of the earlier Gladiator but this lushly filmed fable doesn't quite have the tightness and snap of Gladiator. Rydly Scott generally directs films that are always beautiful to look at, with detailed and interesting historical contexts and dramatic panoramas. This is no different and for this alone the film is worthwhile. Orlando Bloom does a credible job and most of the supporting cast is exceptional. The script however is uneven, defective in places and jolts around like it is looking over several plot lines before settling on one. Jeremy Irons and Liam Nilson, after good performances, stumble out of the film incongruously and create an imbalance in the flow of the story. This could have been a much better film if more attention and talent were lent to the script. Still, if you like flashy historical fables like I do, you will probably like this film."
5,Perfect.,I have read the story and the movie already on TV. It is very well done and clearly expose the chivalry character of the time between the opponent leaders involved in the Crusades in the XI & XII centuries. Excellent movie.
3,Like this movie.,"i like this move, I can't really explain why. So of course I had to buy it. Delivery was timely and I still watch it from time to time. Will buy movies through Amazon again."
2,Unbalanced,"This is no Blackhawk Down, Gladiator or Blade Runner. It's not even Hannibal or GI Jane or (heaven forbid) 1492.Christians are for the most part, bad. Moslems are good and you best get your roman tails out of Jerusalem.With that said, Orlando Bloom cannot carry a movie, you don't care about most of the characters. Christian religious zealots are bad (I feel the need to repeat it because the movie certainly does ad nauseum). The script and the story are light brush strokes on what had the potential to be a lovely colorful canvas.If you can suspend your tolerance for indifferent writing and some poorly casted parts - I am sure many will enjoy the special effects.While Ridley Scott has successfully created other worlds you feel a part of, this isn't one for me.Rent, don't Buy."
2,More effective than counting sheep!,"The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson (sp?) are good actors. It's the story that sucks. Maybe the story is true, maybe it's been embellished ... I wouldn't know because I'm no historian. But I do know that I could barely keep my eyes open. It was torture to watch it. I finally gave up after an hour."
1,Worse than King Arthur,"KOH is about as interesting as watching paint set. It is quite possibly one of the worst epics ever made. Considering that this is a Ridley Scott movie one has to beg the question - what on Earth did he think he was doing? Since the early 1990s Hollywood has been evading a movie about the Crusades... and now we can see why. An English blacksmith turns out to be the heir of a Jerusalem Knight and goes off there to find himself, only to replace his father and serve the King of Jerusalem who is having a hard time maintaining law and order in his own house while Muslims are knocking down his doors. Plotless, pointless and utterly boring, the fight sequences have been seen so many times before that you will just sleep your way into the end credits... and what a three hour nap it will be. For all the big names on display this really does leave much to be desired. Forget Gladiator or Troy. This one is clearly a no-brainer."
1,a disappointing film,"I was ready to love this film but was bitterly disappointed. For one thing, a man did not just decide to become a knight at age 18. He had to begin training when he was three years old. Chivalry was a way of life, not a career. The sets were very authentic but if they had stuck more with the real story it would have been magnificent."
2,False history,"Although I had a little hope that Ridley Scott wouldn't have given the crusades a Hollywood treatment, Kingdom of Heaven turns out to be utter crap! Everyone who even has the slightest historical knowledge knows, that the cristian knights butchered all Arabs that weren't willing to accept their religious thoughts. And what do we see here? The cristians are nothing but good guys that mean no harm and the Arabs are like the indians from Dances with Wolves: humble, brave and sophisticated men with a noble code of honour.The only villains in the movie are the Templars that are looking for a holy war. To achieve this they murder some innocent Arabs for no reason...so this way giving the peaceful Arabs a reason to start to fight. This movie clearly tries to build a bridge between the Western and the Eastern civilization, but fails hopelessly as it is not telling the truth.(SARR)"
3,Region 2 Oops,"I have no Idea what the movie was like, It was for region 2. I had no idea that there were regions where movies would not work. so heads up if you don't live in region 2 don't buy movies with Region 2 after the title. They won't work here.The seller was willing for me to return the item but for me it wasn't worth the effort. No more movies from England for this buyer."
1,disapointed,"I was very disapointed with this purchase I thought it was the movie not all the bonus and behind the scenes stuff -_- and I only received 1 dics, it said 2 disc set."
3,Kingdom of Heaven DVD,"I recieved the DVD extremely fast and it was packaged well so it couldn't be hurt while being shipped. I can't complain about the price nor can I complain about the expedience of shipping, but the description was vage compared to what the case of the DVD looked like... there were several holes in the plastice surrounding the case and packaging left on from when the previous owner has puchased the DVD new. All around nice and can't complain."
4,Intense Action & A Good Plot,"I'm not to sure about how true this story really is but the action is intense and Orlando Bloom's Performance is just outstanding. This movie is also a good drama and it has a bit of a love story to it to. But the was okay and it was sort of Slow and boring, but i liked it.Plot: A blacksmith named Bailien just discoverd that he is a hier to the french when his father wich he never meet seeks him out, so bailien can join him on a crusade. After losing his Wife, Baby & his shop he joins his father. He ends up defending the city of Jueraslium from the Musliums. can they complete victory or will jueraslim fall to it's doom. Well you'll have to watch the movie and find out."
2,PROBLEMS WITH SIGHT AND SOUND,"My husband and I only watched an hour of ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" because we could not see or hear it. Possibly the dvd was defective, because the scenes were so dark, they were hard to see, and the volume was so low, we couldn't hear it.I'm sure the story is marvelous, but I'll never know for sure."
2,WHERE'S RUSSELL CROWE OR EVEN GERARD BUTLER WHEN YOU NEED THEM??,"Kingdom of Boredom more like it.Truly epic looking crusades flick has some eye popping battle scenes and looks gorgeous on Blu-Ray. Pity that it's such a colossal bore. Ridley Scott's a master artisan whose skills are fully on display in this sumptious production- but even he's struggling to haul a good movie out of a terribly wobbly script and fly weight leading man.There's definately a lot of quality in this elephantine film, including the stellar supporting cast and terrific action scenes, but it doesn't come together with any narrative drive or vigour. And Bloom simply lacks any real screen prescence or charisma to be the hero of this-and he appears much too young to be credible. He'll have you pining for Russell Crowe and (if your a die hard movie buff) Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous unproduced movie about the Crusades that was going to be directed by Paul Vehoeven."
4,Great Movie,"obviously the ""too slow"" guy isn't a histoy buff, or else he wouldn't be saying it was to slow. the movie was full of historical events and it was pretty interesting, and about 10-20 minutes into the movie there is a pretty sweet skirmish, and alot of continous or important information from there out"
5,Great epic picture,"I'm not that good in history so I'll leave that part to others. But I did thoroughly enjoy this movie. I can't even remember seeing this movie advertised and was surprised it was made relatively recently. Perhaps the movie is just too long for the theatre and would draw too limited an audience. However, the acting is consistent and strong; the cinematography, particularly the continuity, is admirable. Ridley Scott did a very fine job. It took me a while to finally purchase this DVD set, but I am very happy I did."
1,Kindom of Heaven,This movie is...........very GOOD!!!!! Yeo! i rate this movie 1 star because this movie A1!!!!!!!! MUST WATCH OR DIE!!!! :)
2,Kingdom of Stinkfest,"This movie is ready for Pesntch. He'll love it because it has no plot, poor character development and a frustrating story line- what the heck is going on??? Sure I understand the Crusades and this would make an interesting backdrop for a movie. But Ridley Scott has given us a convoluted heap of bologna. Maybe Roger Ebert can eat the bologna since he reccomended this chit. Pesntch will probably love this since his taste is for bologna. SIN FIN"
2,Why?,lots of action and blood- a good story about giving Jerusalem back to the Muslums. Would not watch it again.
1,Lousy,I bought this on a whim ... figuring with Orlando Bloom in the lead and Ridley Scott at the helm that it might be a good movie. Turned out to be one of the worst I've ever seen. It was choppy and difficult to follow. Don't waste your time or money.
3,"Great movie, great transfer... but NO special features!","I have had the 4-disc Director's Cut edition of this excellent movie on DVD for some time now, and I was hoping to replace it with this Blu-Ray copy. Unfortunately, this release, while it does have the entire movie on a single Blu-Ray disc (which is definitely a plus), seems to be lacking all of the excellent special features that were on the 4-disc DVD release. This was a rather unpleasant surprise.BUYER BEWARE: You will NOT be getting the special features listed in the product description, which appears to have been copypasted directly from the 4-disc DVD set.That said, the movie itself is excellent (enough has already been said about its superiority to the theatrical version of this film) and it looks better than ever with this Blu-Ray transfer. It's worth upgrading to the Blu, just know that if you're a special features junkie, you're going to want to hang on to your DVD set."
3,The Crusades,A young knight during the Crusades who must battle overwhelming forces to save his people and fulfill true destiny. One of the only films in awhile I actually enjoyed watching. I would recommend it. The Knights Templars was the largest branch of Christianity. They were warrior monks who because of social pressures made it so they were the standard bearers of Christianity.
5,absolutely fabulous!,"This movie was good as the theatrical cut, but even better as the director's edition! Everyone should see it."
3,Kingdom of Heaven is okay,"but I was bored up until the last 45 minutes. The final battle was great but up until then it was boring. They gloss over the small and intimate moments of the story so that just when you are getting relaxed the movie all of a sudden jerks you somewhere else. It isn't sloppy per say, I just like movies with a perfect mix of action and simple, intimate moments. Which I felt this movie glossed over. Gladiator and Troy are better examples of this. Some people think spending too much time on scenes like that is too scandalous and glamorous., but I disagree. This is not a horrible movie, good enough to rent and has great battle scenes but not a perfect movie overall."
4,Good movie and superior DVD release,"Presumption: Although I like historical movies, I thought the box office failure indicated a rather long, boring movie. I was not particularly thrilled with Orlando as the lead. I thought the DVD extras would make it worth purchasing.Result: The movie was much better than I thought it would be, and deserves 4 stars on its own. Although long, it was not boring. Casting was very good, although some of the finest actors might have been a bit under utilized. The DVD extras are first rate. Additionally, the Pilgrim's Journey has an amazing amount of information for anyone interested in this time period."
3,Better Than The Critics Said,"I was suprised with this one since I had heard such bad things about it. I expected it to be a complete trainwreck but it wasn't. Sure, it has some problems. Everything seemed kind of rushed to me. Specifically, the training sequence with Neeson's character. I think he trained in about 30 seconds before getting in an actual fight. No montage or anything. From what I've heard there's actually supposed to be a longer director's cut edition planned and a lot of footage was removed from this version. Maybe when the extra footage is added it will get a 4 star rating from me. However, I do have to say I wish Ridley Scott would do some stranger films since he's done two epics already. Maybe go back to sci-fi since he created Alien and Blade Runner, two films that are superior to this one. Kingdom of Heaven is a very underrated film so pick it up. Another good release you should pick up is Skinny Puppy's Greater Wrong of the Right Live. Two great films. Check them out."
4,"Good Movie, Good Action","The movie got a bad rap in the box office, but I think this is definately worth watching especially for those interested in that era. The characters are well thought out and enticing. Definately worth your time."
5,Kimgdom of Heaven - The Directors' Cut,"Probably my new favorite movie. Orlando Bloom is great, the settings are great and the overall feel of the movie is superb"
2,Great movie but they butchered this version,This version was butchered in the editing room. How do you cut approx 50 minutes from a movie? After viewing this version I saw that it was a good movie so I ordered the director's cut. Much better. Buy the director's cut if you purchase this movie.
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,It's a Great Movie. I've seen it so many times. But what the different with this:Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] (this BD cheaper)?
5,Kingdom of Conscience,"Yes, this movie is a morality play, but it is an excellent morality play. Balian is the essence of the true knight incarnate. This is a man who takes the oath seriously:Be without fear in the face of your enemies.Be brave and upright that God may love thee.Speak the truth even if it leads to your death.Safeguard the helpless.He follows this oath even if ""doing a small evil will result in a great good."" He follows this oath, and his own conscience, even if it means disobediance to a beloved king. For ""A King may move a man, a father may claim a son, but remember that even when those who move you be Kings, or men of power, your soul is in your keeping alone. When you stand before God, you cannot say, ""But I was told by others to do thus."" Or that, ""Virtue was not convenient at the time."" This will not suffice. Remember that.""""Yes, this is a morality play, but when is the last time you saw true morality exalted anywhere, even in a play? I found it both refreshing and inspiring."
4,"The Real ""Gladiator""","I have to give only 4 stars because a couple of scenes seemed to a little silly to me. However, this is an excellent film. It's everything that ""Gladiator"" was not. Ridley Scott scores big this time. I fully expect this film to return when the Oscar nominations are announced next February."
1,The Kingdom of Feigned and Affected Grandeur,"Ridley Scott in his 'Kingdom of Heaven' obviously wanted to cash in on Orlando Bloom from Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings'.Too bad.Bloom's acting was fine just simply mis-cast. And the character ""Belian"" that he plays - a blacksmith turned warrior/military leader in what seems like 2 seconds flat is just ridiculous.Now the message of the film was very good - about respecting another faith/religion - that we're all part of humanity. Yes, i agree. But Ridley Scott's directing here was 'too much', that is, over-indulgant (especially with respect to the fighting scenes) and too characterized by feigned or affected grandeur.Simply put 'Kingdom of Heaven' felt contrived - and 'epic-ish'."
2,hollywood view,"Yet again, Hollywood's political correctness seeks the almighty $.This is Hollywood BS at it's worst. Chritian Europe was under attack from the Muslim hodes. By now, we should know what Muslim jihad is. This movie is nothing more than the typically leftist, anti-US, politcally correct, Hollywood re-writing of history. If you watch this, read your history! Two stars for cinamatography."
3,Ridley Scott's blockbuster is a tad long,"From Smother Magazine smother.net:""Kingdom of Heaven"" is yet another huge blockbuster from director Ridley Scott whose past work has included such big beasts as the ""Alien"" series, ""Gladiator"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""Black Hawk Down"". The movie is a tale about the crusades of the 12th Century and how one man must lead the armies to defend Jerusalem against invading Muslim armies. It certainly feels like it parallels current events to some degree with the Iraq war and it seminal Christian-based army versus the indigenous Islamic residents and insurgents. The movie is filmed brilliantly as one might expect but does tread on for a tad too long. The battle scenes are great and reminiscent of Scott's work on ""Gladiator"". The plot is occasionally thin with some commentary yawningly dull. Worthy of a rental or a Tivo but not much else."
5,A masterpeice,"This is the movie you must see. The reason it failed at the box office I do not know, but when I first saw this movie, i was truly moved by its engrossing storyline. Its magnificant use special effects. I could not find one element of the film that I did not enjoy. You don't like the fact that the christian crusaders were heartless murderers? THATS WHAT THEY DID! They murdered thousands of muslims during those dark times. You do not believe me? research this topic online, read a book on the crusades. or watch the history channel. ALl of the things the christians did really happened in the movie. The names(all but Balian) were real!. NOT FAKE. And yes Gi De Lusenyon'(pardon if i spelled it wrong) did lead an army of 17k christians with his buddy Reynold and was massacred. But besides me correcting all of you non-historians. This movie was a masterpeice and must be seen. 5 stars hands down."
2,Flat and forgettable,"This movie wasnt terrible, but I can't recommend it. I fell asleep during half of it because it never caught my interest. The efforts of the filmmaker seemed to be more asthetic then creating anything dynamic enough to hold your attention for a couple of hours. It's a shame...the Crusades would have been a great storyline for a movie, but this is more like a boring fantasy."
2,Confusing,"Orlando Bloom plays a recently widowed blacksmith in France who is sought out by his father, Liam Neeson, a noble and a knight returning to the Crusades in Jerusalem. Orlando follows him, then inherits his estate after his untimely death. Suddenly, everyone is listening to this nobody from nowhere, and Orlando ends up heroically leading the army of Jerusalem. Huh?I guess movies like this about interesting historical periods are very hard to make. Look at Alexander and Troy. I thought I was conversant with the Crusades, having read a score of books about the period (specifically the fascinating Eleanor of Aquitaine), but found this murky movie impossible to follow.P.S. - Note to Ridley Scott: every cut does not spew blood like a geyser."
2,If you liked the original theatrical release...,"If you liked the original theatrical release (which was the first version of the film that made it to DvD) and own it, more than like you have all you'll need from KoH. I REALLY enjoyed the theatrical release, purchased it...and then later bought this version of the film based on many of its Amazon reviews. While it does add a great deal of watching time to the film, the extra footage really does little to improve the quality of the story or increase the depth of the characters to any ""interesting"" degree. Add to that, that this version of the film doesnt include the great documentaries(History Channel) found on the original DvD release. As I have shared, I REALLY enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven.....but didnt/havent found the purchase of this version to be an improvement over the original in the least. More doesnt always equal better....."
2,Self-Hate Guilt Trip,"A self hate guilt trip, this movie deals with the events surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187. I have no problems with the Crusades being told from the Muslim point of view; the problem with this movie is that the Christians are shown as oozing self hate, doubting their mission in the Levant, when in reality, even this late in the Crusades, they deeply believe in the righteousness of their cause (the movie is otherwise relatively accurate in historic terms). Add to that that the action scenes are very poor, that the acting is uniformly bad (Jeremy Irons is particularly terrible, but you can't forget the awfulness of that new invention of the star system, Orlando Bloom, a stand-in for Argentine footballer Ariel Ortega) and you have a very disappointing movie."
4,Great Movie,One of the better movies I have seen. Not only is there good action/fight scenes - and excellent character development.
4,Kingdom of Heavan Review,"I enjoy the movie. Though it is not completely historical in the plot, save for a few names and events from actual history regarding the Crusades, it tells a good story, difficult the times, though they may be. The shipper did a good job in protecting the product and it arrived in good shape."
3,History in the making,"Kingdom of heaven is a wonderful exercise in fantacy. Ridley Scott has made a good movie about what he thinks should be the role of a knight and has chosen a figure from history to mold the clay of the character. The Technical aspects of this movie were a marvel down to the last detail, the acting was superb with solid performances from supporting cast and main actors alike. this would have made a great story if it were true...it is not historically accurate. If one takes all the time to make sure that the armor is historically accurate and that the events show a period accuracy why not tell the real story... well, because Knights of a code were an Ideal to be strived for... not part of reality. Had this been about a knight of fiction and the events steaped in myth I would have rated this movie a 4 or 5. I like my history as it is, not well stired and doctored with spice."
4,great movie could have done better on the soundtrack,It had a great storyline overall. The battle scenes were superb and orlando bloom did a perfect job as a portraying a leader of the kingdom towards the end of the movie. I really didn't understand why eva green cut her hair in the movie. That was one thing i didnt understand. The soundtrack for the movie however didnt keep my attention at its best. But overall it was a great movie.
4,Very thought-provoking and noble movie regarding the Crusades,"Good movie! It took me 5 years from it's original release for me to see it, but I'm glad I finally did. This is a noble dramatization of how some leaders' consciences may have played out during the crusades, and specifically, the seige of Jerusalem. The moral, religious, and philosophical approaches all held something that everyone could appreciate. Great action, too."
4,Missing info now included,This uncut version added lots of developmental information to make the story better and complete. The completeness of information made more sense and provided a better flow for the story. The theatrical edited version was too brutally edited.Nicely done. I like it.
4,No one does it better than Ridley Scott BUT......,"The beauty of this Blu Ray disk left me breathless. Scott is a master behind the camera and this film is no exception. Nearly every scene could be a prize-winning still image (or classic painting.) The Director's Cut is far superior to the original version, in that it fills in many of the holes in the story line.I consider this one of my all-time favorite films - IN SPITE of Scott's ridiculous view of the crusades and the crusaders (many reviewers below fully agree with him, the poor misguided saps) without mentioning the atrocities commited by the Muslims here and in preceeding years. An uninformed person would come away thinking (as many have) ""Those terrible Christian crusaders. Why would they attack those wonderful, innocent, Muslims."""
2,Almost worth a watch,"If you are expecting a movie like gladiator then I will stop you from putting this in your dvd player. If you didn't like gladiator, you like orlando bloom(you have to really like him), and you like movies with no beginning OR ending, then this will be perfect for you."
3,Kingdom of Heaven,"The only thing I really understood about the movie is that it is a fight for Jerusalem other than that I didn't really follow. The movie is shot very well and looks great. If you like watching visual movies instead of following dialog, I suggest Kingdom of Heaven."
5,4 for the movie 5 becouse of bad press,"I didn't expect much from this movie after hearing what i heard about it and for about the first 45min. or so of the film i thought the assumptions were correct but after that the movie really picks up,if you liked Troy or even Alexander this movie is better than either of those.It may start slow to tell a story but hang in there you may be pleasently surprised!"
4,GOOD movie. BAD press.,"This movie suffered under the weight of Hollywood's awful box-office year. That's too bad. One of the greatest directors in history (Ridley Scott) does it yet again...in fact, I can't remember a bad film done by him.Liam Neeson is incredible, and most suprisingly of all, Scott makes pretty-boy Orlando Bloom very convincing as a warrior. The story is fascinating and the fights are mind-blowing.All of that, plus throw in a cameo by Edward Norton, and you've got an overlooked classic.FINAL VERDICT:she's a BUY, lad."
5,KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AN EPIC OF A MOVIE,"I found this to be an extremely well done and inspiring epic of the Crusades and some of the things that have been ignored for so long about the realities of those times. Orlando Bloom, as always, is brilliant in his role and the other actors and actresses only add substance to his character by their great performances. The cinematography is beautifully done. Kingdom of Heaven is a keeper to be viewed again and again."
5,"Great movie, visually compelling and improved story line","The theatrical version of the movie was excellent, and contained much food for thought in a world wracked by religious wars. I purchased the Blu-Ray edition expecting spectacular battle sequences, and I was not disappointed. However, there is much more to this disk. This is an extended version, and unlike many deleted scenes, the additional scenes in this edition make the story much more alive. I felt that I understood the movie, the characters and their motivation, much better. This is the version that should have been released to the theaters."
4,Just Enough,Good historical fiction with enough action to keep my husband engaged. Plenty of big names to peak his interest to watch it.
5,Average Joe's Review,"All I can say is this: if you have not seen this movie on Blu Ray, then you have not really seen this movie. Its just not the quality of the picture, but the movie itself has so mnay new parts not in the DVD version that I watched, that the movie itself is like your watching it for the first time.Blu-Ray picture and sound is an experience. This is an action flick and it has constant battles and colors to fill your senses. I would say it is the best blu ray film available to date! This one will show you what Blu-Ray is all about."
2,"3 stars for action, Zero for substance","There's a ton of bone-crunching, writhing of swordblades and shields a'clashin. No doubt, it's good action. BUT, Orlando probably wasn't the best choice for the role, and the story is just so bland. Liam Neeson is in it for a whopping 90 seconds.Your thinking ""Ridley Scott; it's got to be awesome"". But alas they gave him a budget for good production value but the rest just sucks. It's definitely worth a look, and good for some mindless action, but you'll have buyers remorse if you purchase."
5,Extend version feels like a different movie,"The theatrical release of Kingdom of Heaven was a good movie, although I did felt back then, that character development and motivations were not well explained; for instance Balian (Orlando Bloom) joining the Crusade seems too rush and also when Sibylla (Eva Green) leaves behind Jerusalem, I couldn't but feel that something was missing.I did had high expectations of the Director's cut since adds around half an hour to this film, the first thing that caught my interest was the fact that Eva Green's character has a son, and basically all scenes that involve this child were deleted to make it more commercially viable. The extended content brings so much to the story that truly is like a different movie, and a better one.Director's cut version on blu-ray is a magnificent release and I would highly recommend it to anyone that had the slightest interest on the theatrical release."
3,"Good movie, if a little too dark","Seems historically accurate, at least as much as possible while still having Hollywood fun. The ending also doesn't feel as fulfilling as you believe it will be as you watch.Pros:-Stunning visuals-Adrenaline pumping sword-fight scenesCons:-little or no comic relief. It becomes maybe too intense-Slightly anticlimactic."
3,Great movie. Poor packaging,"I love this movie, but am sad that the Blu Ray edition lacks the same incredible packaging the standard ed Director's cut received as a 4 disc set. Why is it that the Blu Ray discs are significantly more expensiveand yet the packaging is far less than standard editions... I can only hope in the next 2 years the demand for Blu Ray puts them on firm equalfooting with standard DVDs"
5,A FANTASTIC EDITION. MASTERPIECE.,"After watching this DVD, you have to ask yourself,""How the heck was the first cut of the movie ever allowed out and why don't they destroy it?""This edition ties together all of the missing links that for me, made the original unbearable. With this cut, Scott has a masterpiece. Simply an unbelievable achievement. In the original, my take of Orlando Bloom was to keep questioning how such an underwhelming actor could have such a part? In the restoration, Bloom finally mixes in correctly with the story, and the story itself gets tied together. If you found the original ok, but were left scratching your head, this is your answer. SPECTACULAR. Does it sound like a liked this version?"
3,Kingdom of Heaven,"I was pretty excited about the movie not knowing to much about it in the first place. I agree with one of the written review before i, that this is not a movie for everybody.. I expected more action and killing! i do enjoy the history of it, kind of hard to understand but after an hour and half i get it.. so just keeping it short, dont expect to much like ""gladiator"" from this movie.."
2,Left me cold,"I am an enthusiastic movie watcher...but this movie was just another one of those 2000 Historic genre movies that only has battles. Maybe a ""guy"" thing but I'm tired of movies just going from one battle to the next. I want a story line which this movie didn't have. Yes, there was a story there but not clear and rather improbable.Good costumes and scenery.I kept waiting for something really bad to happen to the son after his proposed wife said he needed to do a little evil for the greater good. Nothing happened except he fought another battle and went home.This high profile movie with good actors (wasted) falls in line with Troy, Alexander and all those huge movies. Just one battle to the next and snippets of dialogue here and there.Bought this movie, but giving it away because it isn't something I'd watch again or give shelf space."
1,This movie doesn't deserve stars,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so historically inaccurate it wasn't even funny. I watched this on vacation on the in room movies and I wanted to throw myself from the balcony. The acting was terrible, but that doesn't even matter. It was like they completely ignored the histoy while writing this movie. I had just taken a college history course at my university and we had discussed the Third Crusede (the one this movie is supposed to be about). The main struggle was between Richard the Lion Hearted and Saladin. Not Saladin and some random blacksmith. Yes, Saladin took Jerusalem before the Third Crusade, but it did not happen in any way like it was portrayed in the movie. And that's not even the half of it. There were so many things in this movie that were historically inaccurate I could probably write a hundred pages on those alone. Stay away from this movie."
3,A fascinating book,"Although it is largely speculative, this is a great resource full of information that was controversial in its day. This book also has great photos documenting the study of the Mitchell-Hedges skull and some interesting theories.This book details Anna Mitchel-Hedges and her father more than most, and it includes a photograph of an affadavit signed by Anna attesting to the story of the skull's origin.Interesting for those studying skulls!"
5,gift,I bought this book as a gift for a friend and haven't sent it yet. It was a request so I'm sure it will be appreciated.
5,definately a true definition of a real biography,I have come to the conclusion that reinhard heydrich was killing alot of the jewish people.
4,Great Price,I was delighted to receive the copy of Civil Procedure that I need for my second year law school studies. Thanks so much...
4,"Just to counter-balance the idiocy of ""John Q. Public""","This story was beautifully illustated by David Mack, as usual. The characters were all interesting and had depth. Bendis' writting, while occasionally wordy, is full of character. Definately worthy of a spot on your bookshelf."
1,It is not part of the DD series,"Unreadable. Just a series of painted and collage pieces. If you are into artbooks, go for it."
5,Beautiful Mendelssohn!,"Chamber Music seems so right during the boisterous mechanics of the holidays and one sure respite from the garish noise of the external season can be found in works like the Mendelssohn Piano Trios.Here Eugene Istomin, Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern perform Piano Trios 1 and 2 in a manner that bespeaks camaraderie of the performers as well as a complete respect for these luminous works. Some have called these works piano sonatas with obbligato and while for this listener that is an unfair judgment, Eugene Istomin plays the piano part with enough flair and thoughtful propulsion that he does at times sound the more important. But that is Mendelssohn's writing and not a self-aggrandizement of a pianist.The overall sound is simply superb. These two trios are some of the loveliest ever written from that era and the gentlemen performing them offer sophisticated and informed interpretations. The recording is excellent, the music is rarefied! Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05"

5,Space saver.,"These rocker switches were a perfect fit for the limited space that I had, where rectangular switches would have looked bad even if I would have had the room for them. These round switches have a professional/factory look. I used these on my plow truck for my plow lights and caution light."
3,too much of her in two Cds,"If i had not previously bought the Rhino millenium collection, this would probably be well worth it. after playing through the 2 Cds, well.. all the best songs are on the Rhino millenium collection already . So for first time buyers, that Cd is enough and no need to buy this one unless you are a hard core fan and want to keep all her songs.Not all the songs are that great in this Cd.. But ""Look of Love"" is realy awesome !!"
2,"Two CDs, too much","Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"" is a classic early rock'n'roll song and it is still today wonderful and exciting listening to it. She continued with a string of songs in the same style, most of them were also commercial hits, her voice is very suitable for these kind of songs and also for the ballad ""You Don't Own Me"" (later covered by Dusty Springfield). Her ""Maybe I Know"" is perfect. The 2nd CD contains less good songs than the 1st one, as ""What's a Girl Supposed To Do"" or her cover of ""Young Love"". It seems that by the end of the decade, she tried several different styles, according to the changes in public's favourite styles. Neither the chart entries nor the quality of these recordings can be compared to those on CD 1. Two CD set is too much of her, I recommend her 1 CD Best Of from her Mercury years rather than this one."
4,My name is ...and I'm a romance reader.,"There's no 12-step program to wean me off romance and there's no reading genre more conducive to fast MPH on my stationary bike so I don't want to stop anyway. But I don't take it seriously so I loved this spoof of the romance genre, its writers and readers. It's LOL reading most of the way. I did find the male romance-writer protagonist to become a little annoying towards the end of the story, but should I really have been annoyed? To be annoyed would be to take it seriously. But, seriously, folks, this is funny."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"I read a lot romance novels. I have 3 categories, #1 category is ""keeper and share with others"" #2 category is ""give to book exchange"" and #3 category ""throw away in the first trash can you can fine"". WELL THIS BOOK WAS CATEGORY #3. I didn't think there was ANY chemstry with the characters and the whole story line was ridiculous!"
5,Great protection and COLOR!,Our household has 3 iPods so getting the silicon covers in 5 colors is great for keeping everyone straight! We have had these covers in plain white in the past and paid more for 1 than we paid for the whole accessory collection offered here... great bargain and helps protect against drops and knocks!
4,Nice Christmas movie,"Feel good, cute Christmas movie. Characters are compatible and believable. I'll watch it again next Christmas season among many other seasons movies."
4,Nanny for Christmas,This is a very nice Christmas show and has some very cute moment. Well acted and full of love and good cheer of Christmas. I recommend this for anyone who wants a good Christmas movie.
2,What was the Christmas story both characters read annually as children?,Total cheese movie and the only thing worth it was that I picked up a story recommendation for my kids. But what was it?! Does anyone recall this plot detail? I appreciate help from anyone else who mindlessly watched this flick.
2,Okay Movie but not worth the price.,"I was curious to watch it since I find this actress extremely attractive and having Dean Cain there as well. I expected it to involve more holiday romance but was disappointed. First of all I thought she was going to romance Dean Cain but the characters were all screwed up. At least the end was good but I still regret having downloaded it. People, wait till it comes out streaming on Netflix don't buy it."
3,Misleading promotion,"I initially decided to watch this movie because I saw that Dean Cain (who I am a fan of from his days as Clark Kent/Superman from Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, but once I saw the film I realized he had a very small role in the film. I saw quite a bit of trailers prior to the film airing on TV and each trailer only mentioned Dean Cain. I am also a fan of Emmanuelle Vaugier so I decided to watch anyway, but the promotion of this film left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. As for the film itself, I guess it was okay, but I found myself bored throughout it. I don't think the story was engaging enough for me to truly enjoy the story. I also felt like some of the issues in the film were kind of contrived and this is coming from a person that enjoys most Christmas films."
1,Got rid of it,"I love Christmas movies and have a rather large collection. This movie, however, did not make it into my collection. I was disappointed in its message. The Nanny undermined the mother of the kids she was watching. I believe the mother should have been more fun and loving. I truly do, but I do not think that the Nanny should have let the kids eat junk food and participate in activities that the mother was against. In the end, the mother changed her ways and was feeding her kids what she had considered junk food earlier. The Nanny ended up with everything she wanted. The mother became more fun like the Nanny. Great. Alls well that ends well - except that it left me not liking the Nanny for undermining her boss. Also, I like Dean Cain, but the cover is misleading. Cain plays a very, very small role in this film."
1,"Yawn, terrible, don't bother","Terrible plot, acting and everything else. Do not waste your time and money unless you are using it to fall asleep, then it may be cheaper than medication."
1,Twas the Night of a Terrible Movie,The story was very weak.The acting terrible.The scenes clumsy.The protagonist has a memory montage that makes you go through the same painful scenes a 2nd time.Yawn.This movie was painful to watch.Don't be one of the 10's of people that make the mistake and watch this movie.
3,Review on Nanny for Christmas,"Wasn't quite what I expected. I really like and enjoymovies with Dean Cain. However, he didn't really havea major part in the movie as was lead to believe. Themale character was somewhat weak when it came to the loveinterest of the ""Nanny"". Cynthia Gibb did a great job, butoverall the movie just wasn't that great."
3,like all christmas movies,It was cute. It was a typical story. The only thing that bothered me was the random orthodox jew who bought a chanuka bush. So stereotypical but guess what - orthodox jews dont buy that.
1,Horable Christmas Movie,This was the lamest christmas DVD I have seen in a really long time. I don't know why Dean Cain was on the front of the DVD he only had about 8 lines in the whole movie and his character never really made sense. They had too many story lines going on that none of them made any sense. Do not waste your time or money on this DVD this year!
2,A Nanny For Christmas,The cover is deceptive as CAIN is not a main character. The story is predectable but ok for a family Christmas movie.
2,"Wow, all these other reviewers may be smart people, but they have probably never heard mozart performed well","I'm going to be perfectly honest with you. Mozart is really difficult. I've probably heard 50 versions of these symphonies, and most are not very inspiring. Neither is this one. These are for my taste sluggish, plodding performances, but more importantly they are clearly under-rehearsed, unrefined, and extremely un-clean. Good mozart symphony recordings are difficult to come by, but believe me, you can do better."
2,This is with the New York PO,"Its not on the same level as Walter with the Columbia.I wish the eventual new owner of the Sony catelogue(M Jackson is selling his Sony holdings) will re-release the complete Columbia SO in the last 6.See my recviews on Mozart, Bohm, Walter, MackerrasAt times I give the nod to Walter, times to Bohm.I guess overall I prefer the Bohm/Berlin set. This conclusion based on todays comapre of the sym 40. April 15,2006.PaulEDIT: I recall as I listen to the clips, its not on the level as with the Columbia. I had this walter/New York on vinyl yrs ago.Sony for some reason will not rerelease the Columbia in the last 3 syms."
2,Silver Dollar Eucalyptus,Indoor or outdoor? Better start off indoor. I planted outdoors and watered for weeks and they all died. It may be the southern soil and heat. But I will not order again.
1,Pathetic Reasoning,Reading this work was an exercise in forcing myself to keep reading. The holes in the reasoning are immense. I'm all for people expressing their views and I'm all for reasoned discussion-- but you won't find it here. Try another work.
4,Vallejo Boyz!,"This CD is not quite as good as Vol.1. They should've had the long version of 'Too Tight' on the Vol.1 CD in the first place and they should've chosen the songs; 'Loveshine', 'Secrets', and 'If Your in Need of Love' instead of 'Electric Lady', 'Pretty Lady', and 'Lovin' Fever'. Those songs are weak! I find it hard to believe that 'Loveshine' didn't even make it on either Volume 1 or 2 CDs."
3,"Not enough selections, but its hard: The Sequel","In response to the many complaints of Mercury's first compilation release in 1993, the label decided to include some of other misses and a few obscure songs by the Vallejo Valley funk band. They did the same thing with The Gap Band, Cameo, and The Bar-Kays. Because of the obscurity of many of the song selections, the second greatest hits collection did'nt sell as well and its considered to this day to be very rare. Here is my list if I had a say in what to include for this second compilation1) Happy Face2) Da Lady3) Ever Love4) Loveshine5) Who Has The Time6) Sho' Feels Good To Me7) Make It Last8) Give Your Love To Me9) Pretty Lady10) Con Funk Shunize Ya11) If You're In Need of Love12) Body Lovers13) Burnin' Love14) She's A Star15) Promise You Love16) If I'm Your Lover17) So EasyNuff said. Songs I did'nt mention from the original are either should be on the first compilation or just not a good fit (c'mon, ""Electric Lady"" and ""Lovin' Fever?"")"
4,Good Disc,While I dug Volume One better this disc has some jams on it.Electric Lady is the jam.this band can Groove&do slow jams.Con Funk Shun always had their own thing.it's cool getting the Longer Version Of Too Tight.
5,Buddism for everyone,"Jataka tales are the Buddhist equivalent of Aesop's fables or ""fairy tales"".I had actually heard one of theses stories before, The Brave Little Parrot (searching for that story is how I found this book), before, but thought that it was unique and one of only a few of its kind. Thankfully, I was very wrong! Like most cultures, the Buddhist culture has many little didactic tales for children and new initiates. Stories that do not just lecture someone on how they should live, but actually tell a story of someone living the way that we all should try and live -- showing by example.Rafe Martin is first and foremost a storyteller. This collection of fables and stories feels like what it is: a collection of organic stories that have been told, out loud, to children and adults again and again before being written down to be passed on to more children and adults. I loved it."
2,originality is a good policy...but puh-lease!,"After shocking one and all with The River Ophelia, eccentric Sydeny author unleashed this...a relatively tame account of a young woman's, Marilyn, trip to New York. It is there she parties with folk such as Elvis, Greta, the Beatles and Lawrence and almost ends up dead. One almost wishes she does cark it after a while. Honestly, great originality and loads of imagination. But, please - self indulgence isn't everyone's stoli."
4,A Great Start!,The first page teaches a valuable lesson and sets the stagefor the rest of the book. Life after death is something we all need!
2,The Silver Cord,"This book was way too long. I would compare reading it to trying to chew my way out of a carboard box. Distasteful, boring, bland and time consuming. I think Mr. Edwards is more interested in writing soft-porn in the disguise of spirituality. The charadcters were one dimensional people who were not in love but in ""lust"". I cannot imagine anyone relating to ""Manic Mandy"", unless they were selfish, bipolar, nymphomaniacs. God was a side issue tossed around here and there while Mandy and Bryan chased each other around trying to get it on.Sorry, this was not at all what it was cracked up to be in the descriptions and book cover. A big disappointment!"
2,Paperback Writer,"This book spends too much time criticizing three of the Beatles,John, Ringo and especially George Harrison.Geoff's obvious dislike for Harrison really detracts fromwhat at times might be an interesting read.I actually put the book down several times during thefirst few chapters, driven away by his constant criticisms.To hear Geoff tell it, he's the one that should be calledthe fifth Beatle, not George Martin.reads like a novel that Paul would write....Let It Be."
1,Shameless tripe,"With the exception of sometime employer Paul McCartney, no one escapes Emerick's petty, self-serving tirade. At times you almost get the impression that Emerick thinks that he and McCartney could have done as well without those other pesky people. Let's see, George Martin was a scene stealing sop who took credit for all of Geoff's wonderfulness, John was a space cadet, George was a subpar musician and Ringo was unfriendly. (In Ringo's defense, if Emerick is as graceless in person as he is on these pages, I'd avoid him too.)Emerick had a wonderful opportunity to pen a truely insightful book on a grossly overwritten topic. Instead he let his ego and vanity dictate what is no more than a transparent tribute to his mentor, friend and meal ticket, Paul McCartney.Frankly, the Beatles and McCartney deserved better."
1,Paul McCartneys apologist,"Obviously slanted in McCartneys favor, Geoff Emericks book portrays the other Beatles as inept and un-talented.High and mighty praise for McCartney aside, I would not reccomend this book for any serious Beatle fan."
3,Don't Read this if you are a George Harrison Fan,"While Geoff Emerick is a gifted sound engineer, and he contributed much to make the Beatles music unique, I feel this book should have been edited more tightly to make it more enjoyable to read. True, George Harrison was a weaker guitar player at the beginning, but Mr. Emerick repeatedly makes comments about it ad nauseum. He also over praises Paul McCartney to the point where you think he is trying to build himself up by his association with Paul. This book was interesting for the insights of the recording music business, but I found it annoying to read towards the end."
2,I expected more,"This book could have been great, but is actually quite disappointing. It reads like one of those ""as told to"" celebrity biographies, with Geoff being the focus and hero at all times, especially during the Beatles' recording sessions. There's very little new insight or information here (other than Geoff's personal opinions about the Beatles as people and performers). Instead, we get a rehash of the old stories and anecdotes that have been around for years. George Martin told these same stories much more interestingly in the past, and with a great deal more humility."
2,Geoff Emerick and the Beatles,"I have never been so anxious to read a book and subsequently so let down by one. One would think that Emerick, with help from McCartney, were the only two responsible for the Beatles success. It seemed to pain him to give George Martin any credit what-so-ever and the three remaining Beatles were trashed on nearly every page. It seems as though he feels he must tear everyone else down to make improve his own status. This man is clearly bitter that he hasn't achieved the legendary status of Martin and the Beatles. But what he forgets is that to Beatles fans he has! It is also clear that the book is so slanted toward McCartney that it almost gives it a ring a fiction and gossip rather than an inside look at the music, which is what we all thought the book was going to be about. I gave this book two stars because there were a few interesting nuggets in it, but really it deserves one star for turning what should have been a landmark book into a gossip column."
2,"This boring guy really hates George, John & Ringo","If you think only Paul McCartney is the ONE TRUE GOD then this is the book for you. If you like the whole group, avoid it like the plague. What a waste of my time. He spends most of his time cutting down poor George Martin, this guy either had no control over the final version or he's a back stabbing scumbag."
2,Coming to a Bargain Bin Near You!,"Emerick and co-author Massey can't seem to get out of their own way in delivering the story of Emerick's days recording the Beatles. Their awkward, uneven account reads like a 300-page high school writing assignment.This book desperately needs a talented co-author. Even more, it cries for an editor to give the book strong direction, eliminating diversion and self congratulation while focusing on the kind of detail and anecdote that could truly shed new light on the greatest musical story of a generation.The story might have been compelling, except for the ego, cliche, pettiness, and sycophancy leaking through nearly every page. I will say that this book does reveal a few insights, but must also caution that the effort required to find them will require a thorough cleaning of shoes afterward.The book is destined for the Dollar Bin here, there, and everywhere."
5,Best Beatles Book,I've read countless Beatles stories..this one is by far the best..especially if you are a musician...
2,"Geoff, the 5th Beatle","I like the insight that Geoff brings to the actual recording of many of the Beatle's albums. However, he makes George out to be a hack musician and not much of human being to boot. He also gives himself enough credit to perhaps make you wonder why EMI never built a statue of him in front of the Abbey Road studio. I think the book is overall a good read for any Beatle enthusiast, but Geoff would have done himself so much more good to not make George Harrison, Ringo, and often George Martin look average. ...of course he has an undying love for Sir Paul!"
3,"There was more than one talent in the Beatles, Geoff.","After reading this book, one can't help but think that Emerick would have liked to title it: ""Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Genius of Paul McCartney (and three other guys).""While this is an interesting, and largely unchronicled, aspect to the Beatles' career, it is EXTREMELY dismissive of talent of Harrison, Starr, and even Lennon."
5,beatle fans can really appreciate it,"reading this book, as long as you know most beatle songs, will give you a better understanding and appreciation for the beatles. someone let me borrow it, and i have no background in audio production, but you begin to understand it through emerick's clear descriptions. He points out little things that happened in the studio that one would never catch. It's fun to read about it then play back the song and know where a certain lyric or idea came from. Great book"
5,Essential Beatle Reading,"Geoff Emerick's ""Here, There and Everywhere"" is an insightful chronicle of The Beatles' recording sessions at Abbey Road. As EMI engineer and co-producer, Emerick doesn't mince words in documenting the Fab Four's creative highs and lows. With the exception of George Martin, he understands the group dynamic better than anyone. Of course, not all of Emerick's work was Beatle-related - hence his enjoyable anecdotes on artists ranging from Judy Garland to Elvis Costello. A valuable book for historians of popular music."
4,love the beatles,"really good book with a lot of insight on the technical side of recording back in the day when 4 track was common. This author did miss out on some sessions and yet he did follow McCartney into his solo career, engineering for him and Wings, which I found interesting. A must read for the real Beatle fan."
5,Great book,Feel like I know how the lads really were. Like being there in the studio with the Beatles. Geoff was a big part of the BEatles sound that's for sure.
4,Beatles Fan,"Being a big Beatles fan and a musician,I always was always curious about how they worked in the studio and this book told a lot.I also enjoyed the anecdotes about things that happened in the background."
4,Great read...but...a few things bugged me.,"I really found this book interesting and i do recommend it. YOu can find out all about it from other reviews. My only problem with this kind of book is that the writers generally fall in love with McCartney and view the rest as a pain. Same deal here..in fact he was so dismissive of Ringo that he was not even included on the cover. Just a shot of the 3 Beatles is shown...but as we know, there were actually 4 Beatles. He also disses Harrison wherever there is a reference to him which gets tedious after the 15th time. Of course he loves Paul..he even loved Pauls dog, his wife and every idea Paul ever came up with. Other than this however, the book is jammed with great insights to the mood of the sessions and dispells many Beatle myths...such as the one that Paul played the drum solo on Abbey Road...It really was Ringo after all..its very well written and fun to read. Highly recommended ..other than the annoying parts."
5,"Here, There and Everywhere",Geoff Emerick was there for the creation of the Beatle sound. It is well written with enjoyable person information.
4,Interesting book,"I picked up this book to find out why the Beatles are so good, and I found all the answers I was looking for. This book gave terrific insight to all four beatles and the camp that surrounded them, though my patience did wear thin towards the end- Emerick favors Paul, tends to repeat himself a little bit, and shows a little disdain towards Lennon and George Martin. That being said, I really thoroughly loved the book as a music student and an audio engineering student, but any fan of music should read this to get a glimpse of the thrilling world that creates the music we all love. I love understanding the context to the music I listen to, and if you do too you'll really enjoy this book."
4,"Great Book, Personal and Technical","I knew this would be worth reading, particularly for any recording enthusiast. It moves quickly into Emerick's days in EMI. The info is extensive, documenting the big sessions Emerick worked on in his assistant days and through to the beatles. This book emerges you in the everday goings on in typical 60s recording studios in London and then you immediately realise why the beatles were so original and demanding. Production techniques and technical breakthroughs are regularly discussed. Each member's behaviour/personality in the studio is documented too. Emerick did some great work with George Martin and Paul McCartney during those sessions and you can really appreciate what happened thanks to this book. You can also see why people burnt out after a few years."
1,This is such an annoying book...,"You will first encounter one of the biggest lines of BS when you read Elvis Costello's foreword where he describes Mr. Emerick at the end of the second paragraph: ""You could not meet a more modest and self-effacing man"". If Geoff Emerick truly has such qualities you'll be hard pressed to find it in this book because the journeyman hack he hired in writing this piece of rubbish does too well of a job in presenting him as completely the opposite. Other reviewers have mentioned the constant fawning over Paul McCartney at every opportunity, the absurd trashing of George Harrison and Ringo Starr at every other opportunity, and the insensitive denouncing of John Lennon in between those opportunities. The put-downs he throws towards George Martin are just childish. This is such an annoying book that halfway through, this long-time Beatles aficionado who was greatly looking forward to reading it had to stop. To paraphrase George Harrison, ""it's a drag, a well-known drag..."""
5,Good Bag for the money,"I have no reservations recommending this bag. It holds air, comes with the bands to hang it, it has not fallen apart and does everything a double ended bag needs to do."
1,VERY POORLY MADE.,"All i can say is this bull crap.i'm a mixed martial arts fighter.and i bought this to train with and wow in the second week it broke,the leather is poorly made.i was highly pissed off."
1,Why so Pictographic,"This was my first Graphology book, and it was dissappointing. If the author has done any systematic research, it found no mention in the book. Instead, the analysis seems to be based purely on visual lines (references to ""foetal position"" shapes & musical notes' shapes & ""smiles"" in people's writing). Agreed that all script started out as pictograms, but this drags things a bit too far.Also, she completely discounts the fact that many people write upto 60% of their alphabets in so called ""print""& that non-cursive writing could also exhibit many numerous variations & unique traits."
3,"It's paper, not really a toy!","We wanted to get a map so we could color the states we've been to together, this is all we could find and have started coloring it. Thank you for having these maps available!"
1,pretentious,"Don't waste your time or money. Everything-the characters, plot, etc.-was not believable. It was a chore to get through this ""novel""."
1,Boring and crap,"""Angel"" is an extremely long novel about Rosie, Nell, Gavin and Kevin who are friends. Gavin is a movie star and Rosie designs costumes for his movies and, in theory, other people's movies. Kevin is Rosie's brother and an NYPD officer. Nell is a successful publicist. The first 140 pages of this book introduce these people and tell us what they all think of each other. The next third of the book elucidates how, even though they are all fabulously rich and successful (except Kevin's not rich, because he's a cop, but he's still very good at it), none of them are very good at having a personal life and managing romantic relationships.In the last third of the book, the four friends seem to begin to suck slightly less, but alas, they do not. The book also begins to suck slightly less, but then, just as it threatens to have some sort of plot, the loose ends are abruptly severed (NOT tied up) and the book ends happily ever after. Wow, was this a giant waste of my time."
1,"No, thanks!",Don't waste your time on this one. This was written in high-school simplicity and is just too predictible.
4,Works great,I wanted to hook the product up to my rear or car prewired CD changer wiring. A special adapter is needed. I contacted the company who sent me the appropriate adapter really fast. It works as advertised.
3,Ran Aground,"Col. Bruce had come into a certain sound that could only be embellised by varied instrumentation. The band is tight,but seem to be coping licks the whole time. The use of canned audience track was what really made this goofy. If it's not canned then why are they screaming and yelling the whole time. It's as if they we're watching a pro wrestling match."
1,Very bad material.,The cotton is really bad and not comfortable. I dont think ill ever buy a bathrobe online again. This was a very bad experience. Very cheaply made from cheap material.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this as a gift for my niece who is a teacher. This version is not the same as my personal copy. When comparing the two, this version is 8 minutes shorter than mine and the parts cut from this video were, in my opinion, what made the movie deliver such a wonderful message. I'd love to purchase the original movie.Mary Bentz"
3,"not exceptional, not terrible","Where the Lilies Bloom was a story set in a rural mountain community. Two stars are left out of my rating because I felt it was very shallow at times. Some things struck me as unrealistic. For an example, in the beginning of the book, the protagonist's sister, Devola, was portrayed as a girl with nothing to her. The protagonist, Mary Call, was four years younger than Devola, but Devola was irresponsible and had her head in the clouds. However, at the end of the book, Devola suddenly underwent an immense change, took charge, and became clearheaded.Despite the book's shortcomings, three stars are merited because I really admired Mary Call's determination and spirit and the way she never gave up. She was not afraid to stand up for herself or for her family. If I had read this book two years ago, I think I would have liked it much more."
2,Kind of boring,"This book is less that okay. I like actions and mysteries, and this isn't one. If you like touching stories, you'll like this book. If you don't, don't waste your time."
3,O.K. for a book project book...,"Yeah I guess this book was O.K... but I have read better. It was too repetitive, and dated. I would rather read Twilight or Harry Potter any day."
2,"Boring, Stupid & Slow!","I thought Where The Lilies Bloom was one of the worst books I have ever read. I am 13 and in 8th grade and I had to read this book for summer reading. I thought it was boring, stupid and very slow. I would definately NOT recommend this book to anyone! The whole book is about how Mary Call lies about her dead father. It was AWFUL!"
1,Never again!,"I am 12 years old and was forced to read this book for 7th grade English. The first of the book was semi-interesting, however I disliked it as I kept reading it. I stopped reading after about the 7th chapter. This book wasn't just made for me, nor was it made for anybody else that I know that had to read it. BOTTOM LINE - GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE, NOT FOR ME. GRADE - D+"
1,Terrible!,"The schemes are entirley unbelievable, the main chareacter is unlikeable and very dumb. There is no reason to paint the mountaineer like this either. They aren't all like that. It is so stereotypical, it made me sick."
2,Not a proper hardcover edition,This was listed as a hardcover book. It is clearly a paperback edition which has been rebound. Not what I had in mind.
4,Where the Lilies Bloom,"Book arrived quickly and was inexpensive. Couldn't find a copy in the bookstores, so was really glad Amazon found. My child had to read it over the summer for school."
4,OK book,This book was exciting but it wasn't the best adventure book I've ever read. Mary Call is awesome!
4,A Book About Survival,I first read it when I was young and loved it and the movie. Now as a teacher with young teenagers I thought it would be a good book to read in our Language Arts class. The girls thought the book was a good book on the theme of survival. The connected with Mary Call being fourteen and trying to keep her family together. They thought she was courageous and showed great determination. Each of my students felt the eay Mary Call felt in the events that uncurled. It is a great book about a young girl trying to survive in a world that presents itself with many obstacles.
3,A Good to be on a middle school rdg. list,"it's a good book, and all. but not what your average 12-14 yr. old wants to rd. the bk. shows courage, responsibility, bravery, and stamina. it's an excellent book to rd. if you like historical fiction that has a twist of romance, comedy, sneakiness, and problems. overall i give it 3 stars."
3,"Good, but not great.",I read this book in 6th grade honors last six weeks and it was ok. I didn't think that there was a well-defined plot. The movie was awful. We watched it after we read the book. Mary Call was even nuttier than Devola if you asked me. If you wan to read a good book read The Witch of Blackbird Pond. My class is now reading that and it is SOOOOO good. If you have the choice between Where the Lilies Bloom and The Witch of Blackbird Pond. Pick the second one!
1,HORRIBLE,"I had to read the book for 8th grade language artsWhat do I have to say?HORRIBLEfirst mary call burryied her dad in a coffin she made herself on the side of a mountainthe bugs could eat him alive.maybe it is just me, but this book was steriotypical for mountainers and BORING.i got a 72 on the test and I read the whole bookId rather jump into a pit of sharks than read thisAnd Mary Call was like ""I'm ugly, and I'm proud of it. I'd rather be ugly and mean than pretty and sweet""This book was just BORING bottom line."
4,Good but flimsy mounting,"The detector is made fairly robustly, but the only thing disappointing was that to mount on a box, there is a think plastic bracket. Rather than having defined screw holes, there are a series of conjoined slots. These slots must be tightened significantly in order to securely mount the base. Unfortunately, the bracket is poorly designed where as the torque applied when tightening one box screw will dislodge the other screw. This is a major oversight by the manufacturer, which creates about 5 minutes of swearing your first time installing this product."
5,Replacement for the CO5120PDB,"I was long overdue to replace my BRK CO5120PDB, a hard-wired carbon monoxide detector. Because it was hard-wired, I was concerned that it might not replace my CO detector. I was fortunate to get some feedback to a question I posed on the site from a couple of Amazon customers and I made the purchase. I had no issues connecting and installing this detector into the space in the wall left behind when I removed my old CO detector. I had no issues testing it and it is running fine.I highly recommend purchasing this product if you're looking to replace an alarm like mine. It literally took me 3-4 minutes to install it and test it. I am confident I'll get years of use from this one - as I did my last."
2,Meh...,i bought this to replace a 1st alert model they no longer make. It probably works ok but the interconnect to other alarms doesn't work and it was really hard to get the detector back on the mount once the two were separated to install. To get it back on I had to use a razor blade to remove parts of the insulation. The 800 number was helpful in figuring out how to get it back on. Overall ok but if I didn't already have a smoke detector right next to it I would have bought a combination smoke/co2 detector. It was delivered on time.
1,False Alarm!,"In Sept 2010, I purchased and installed 2 of these units in my home. About 1 week, after I installed the units much to my surprise one of the detectors starting beeping in the middle of the night! Although, the unit was manufactured in May 2010 it had a battery with an expiration date of Feb 2010 - how stupid is that!If you buy the unit, please check the battery expiration date. Better yet this should be done at the factory before it is shipped to consumers!"
3,"great pictures and proceedures, lacking in new features","The book is well thought out, well illustrated, and very entertaining for all levels of bike enthusiasists. It did not cover A-heads or V-brakes showing little about anything out in the last 5 years. For an overall view of bike repair it is wonderful, for a techinical manual on new equipment and their repair is is seriously lacking."
5,Wonderful help,I have been able to take apart and repair all of the children's bikes. I has saved us a bundle as we have eight. At $40 a bike plus parts I have repaired and rebuild for the time and cost of parts and my children have learned to do for them selves as well. It's a great book to have.
2,A waste of money,"I think that these guys work for Microsoft! Just like Microsoft help systems they are very good at telling you the What and not the How.Lots of pictures of stuff, not much detail on what to do with that information however."
5,Emotional Drive of the Buyer,"One of the best book I have read in the last years. Meets the consumer new trends, and gives a good inspiration to make a big transformation in sales, marketing and R&D."
4,"Easy Read, Useful Info, & Relatable","I think most of us can relate to the case studies in this book...the case studies are almost like looking in a mirror. You see yourself spending frugally on certain products and saving up to afford higher end products just like they did. While I think the book is useful for businesses trying to capture a bigger share of the consumer market, I believe individuals will enjoy the book as well."
2,A failed sequel..,"""Trading Up: Why Consumers Want New Luxury Goods"" of 2004 was a very good (and very successful) book. Mr Silverstein had to come up with a sequel.""Treasure Hunt"" is the result, and its purpose is to address quite the opposite phenomenon; it could have been titled ""Trading Down"".I think that most of the book's ""stories"" (or ""case studies"" if one wants a loftier description) are too loquacious and they very rarely make the author's point.This book is, as most sequels, a let-down."
4,great marketing book,"This is a great book for learning about consumer spending habits and about 'how consumers have bifurcated the marketplace into high-end and low-end.' People trade up to acquire goods and services that are highly important to them, yet bargain hunt for less important items. [...]"
5,Purchasing emotion,"For anyone who is in the business of promoting a brand, this is a must read. It talks about the emotions of purchasing and hurrah, offers global examples vs so many other leading best sellers that are US only centric. Not only is it interesting from a sociological and cultural standpoint but it offers many examples of successful ""back to basics"" for anyone trying to create customer intimacy. From attacking the category like an outsider to successfully spotting trends and understanding emotional connectivity you will take away some great tips and have fun while doing so."
4,"A great, quick read",As a single guy in a medium sized city I was able to learn a lot of different tips and tricks about how to trade up and down for the present and the future. I also learned a lot about how habits I already have are influenced by the Treasure Hunt. [...] It made a great conversation piece with friends about how they unknowingly trade up or down in different aspects of their lives. I recommend it to anyone interested in marketing or business management both as a professional tool or a leisure reading experience.
5,wonderful music,"The recording of the Bach trio sonatas by the unusually rich combination of Rampal, Stern, Parnas and Ritter reminds us of why Bach has--against storms and tides--survived to enlighten, deepen, settle, and delight us."
4,Great with one exception,"We bought this book to take with us on a five-month stay in India, and it was a great resource for our two daughters (ages 7 and 4). The pictures and text are engaging, and the author gives a sense of what life is really like for these kids. He makes a special point of including tribal and Christian children, not just Hindus. Which brings me to the one exception to a glowing review: how in the world did he manage to avoid including a Muslim child?"
4,Eastbay Game Day Duffle,"Great duffle bag - nice size and holds a decent amount of clothes with nice compartments to separate your various items such as your shampoos and facial products. Overall, a decent bag when on the road for a day or two."
4,electric Wolf minus Hubert,"This record is a rock experiment,however it's produced very well. The majority (7 of 8) of the songs are written by co -producer Sonny Thompson. The songs although no Howlin' Wolf composition is present ,and nor is Hubert Sumlin present for whatever reason these compositions still capture the howl of the Wolf in complete Chi-Town style.Great vintage Blues."
5,the great howlin wolf gives a message for the young,"i am not young anymore, but i love it, everything about it, Howlin Wolfs voice, stronger than ever,with feeling and integrity he shines!His band, new to me, but fantastic!"
5,We love it! :),"It is beautiful!!! We love it. The clock also works well. It's hanging on our wall, and it's working very well for several years already. Great value!"
3,hmmm,"I am 14 years old, and had to read Othello for my english class. It looked and sound really boring, but once you get into it and understand what is going it it's not that bad. It is kind of entertaining. It can be quite confusing like many of shakespears's works, and it takes a while to read. But overall it was pretty good. The movie would help you understand it, but it is long and boring, so I would advise you to just read the book."
2,Not useful without MANY CEUs,"I'm a licensed massage therapist (3 years) and massage instructor at a local school. When I bought this book, I thought I'd come away with some practical information that I could apply to my practice immediately. Well, after reading it I don't feel that at all. In fact, I feel that it may be another 10 years before I can become proficient in all the modalities that Weintraub combines to achieve his reported results. Among the courses I'll need to certify in are Acupressure, myofascial release, Body-Mind Centering and visceral manipulation. He's been doing this for 30+ years and I don't feel he has been able to write a book that can teach this method, though he successfully describes the myriad skills needed to practice it."
2,HARD to read and DULL.,"There is a lot of good information in here, but it is poorly organized, has graphics that impede rather than support learning, and some chapters may as well be written in a foreign language (that's how well my classmates and I seemed to understand them). Our professor even skipped one chapter because she didn't feel comfortable teaching it since she didn't understand well enough.Driscoll tends to belabor certain points that are relatively minor while breezing by important theory components as if they were irrelevant...Basically, I found it very hard to stay awake, let alone focus on the literature."
4,An impressive array of impossible things....,"I have to admit, the more I read Connie Willis' stuff, the more I enjoy her. The short stories in here display a very nice range, from frenetic to despairing, and they're all handled well. ""The Last of the Winnebagos"" is really a very moving story, much more than I thought it would be since I'm not a dog person. ""Even the Queen"" and ""In the Late Cretaceous"" were hilarious - the latter indicates that she must have worked in academia at some time in her life... ""Jack"" is an interesting piece, especially since she lets us figure out Jack's secret long before any characters do. There are a few rough points here and there - ""The Schwarzschild Radius"" and ""Spice Pogram"" come to mind, but they're easily made up for by the other stories in the book. Good reading for a long night with some hot chocolate...."
3,"Not bad, but not for those short on time!","Connie Willis is a good writer, good at telling funny and/or moving stories about us people and our problems and triumphs. Hard-SF fans should definitely look elsewhere; all the science and sociology and future-speculation in these stories is completely in the service of the human emotions and predicaments she wants to explore. This is SF really only by accident.I would have enjoyed the book more if the stories had been shorter and tighter, and perhaps if I hadn't read them all at once. At least three of them are rather similar ""screwball comedies"", and those three stories are 27, 60, and 98 (! ) pages long.I think she could have done what she wanted to do in half, or even a third, of the length, without hurting the qualities of the stories. But that may just be because I'm a busy Daddy without spare hours to spend savoring every page.I'm not going to rush out and buy all the rest of her books, but I probably will read more eventually."
3,Not her best stuff,"""Chance"" was the best story by far. ""Even the Queen"" was hysterical. ""Last of the Winnebagos"" was good but too heartbreaking - I wish I'd never read it. ""Winter's Tale"" was worthy of a read, but the rest were mostly disposable. ""Spice Pogrom"" was too silly & long-winded to even finish. I prefer her novels."
5,A Triumph!,"Maybe when Connie Willis was putting together compositions in third grade about her summer vacations, we could have quibbled about the quality of writing or the subject content; but Ms. Willis has long since been giving us quality reading, and the collection of short stories comprising ""Impossible Things"" is Exhibit A. Ms. Willis' wit shows in her introductions, but the stories themselves carry most of the pleasure. Admittedly, one or two seem a bit obscure, but they hardly detract from a polished, enjoyable product. The stories run more into the vein of ""To Say Nothing Of The Dog,"" a romp all its own. For light reading which absorbs no less, I find ""Impossible Things"" right on target. If only I could compose a review as skilled as Connie Willis demonstrates in her tales....."
4,Imaginative and Wide-Flung,"I had to fight back tears as I finished ""The Last of the Winnebagos"" and laughed out loud over ""Even the Queen"". As interesting and varied as the stories, Connie's introductions are witty and enjoyable. A great read!"
1,A bit disappointing...,"I really enjoyed ""To Say Nothing of the Dog"" and I liked ""Bellwether"", so I figured I'd give Willis' short stories a shot. I admit, I was disappointed. Many of the stories in this collection were written in the 80's and early-to-mid-90's, and they haven't worn well over time. Some themes (like an attempt to hop on the anti-political correctness bandwagon) seemed a bit archaic...the modern equivalent of mentioning ""free love"" and ""The Man"" in the books of the sixties or seventies.The parade of surprising, star-crossed romances in story after story began to wear thin too...it became formulaic, and even made some of her novels less satisfying in retrospect (because they adhered to the same formula, and sometimes, the same research).I'd only recommend this book to someone who wants to revel in the Connie Willis formula...otherwise I'd give it a miss and stick to her full-length novels."
5,Kleenex required,"God, ""The last of the Winnebagos"" has to be the saddest story ever written. I hardly ever cry when I read books; during this one, I *wept*. I had to go shut myself in another room because it was embarassing in front of my family. If you undertake to read this, make sure you have ample privacy, a box of Kleenex, and your dog right beside you.As to the other stories--Even the Queen is hilarious, and Ado is frighteningly possible. There's plenty here. I'm not going to discuss the rest of it 'cause I'm off to buy Connie Willis' other books!"
1,This is one of the worst movies ever made.,"This movie is an embarrassment. Mickey Rooney must be in desperate need of money to have appeared in a film like this. Executive producer Roger Corman proves once again that he has no understanding of what the Red Baron stands for. (His first misinterpretation was his 1971 flick, ""Von Richthofen and Brown."") No one who knows anything about the Red Baron could accept a movie in which he kills a young boy's father at home as well as a nurse in a hospital. This movie could have been a spoof of films like the ""Chucky"" movies but it just is not funny. I read in a newspaper that Corman could not find anyone who was willing to distribute this film to movie theaters so that tells you something about its quality."
1,"in truth, one of the worst movies ever made...","ok it's not quite as bad as 'jules et jim', because at least this one is so bad its frequently funny.when you watch this movie its just unbelievable, you will sit slack-jawed with utter amazement. when i see a 'film' like this i wonder: who the hell put up the money to get this made, and did they even look at the script beforehand?"
5,"Great item, price, and delivery time","My husband works in construction and was very upset on a Sunday night when he realized someone had stolen his work hat. I promptly got online and placed a order for this product since we live in an area where speciality itmes are sometimes hard to find. The hat was delivered two days later and he loved it. I also had no idea what a great deal I got on this hat, and he couldn't believe it when I told him how inexpensive it was."
2,This is funny?,"The first season was better. Unfortunately, this one seems to have been taken over by a gang of 12 year old boy writers. If you like crude, gross humor that involves bodily functions, then this is ideal for you. However, if you prefer intellectual, clever comedy, then you're not going to like this. The cast seems to be having a good time, but I found these episodes almost unwatchable. The extras, including interviews with cast members, are slightly interesting, but it seems padded."
2,Not as good as season 1,"I was hoping for an improvement in this show but it just seemed to be nastier and had more foul language. I'm by no means a saint, but it just seemed to lose something by having more vulgarity. I think that I enjoyed the ""Super Liza"" and ""Grandma Bell"" skits the most. I really missed all of the ""Celesbian Interviews"" on the extras DVD and had hoped that there would be as many - if not more - as season 1. I was also hoping for more from ""Sapho's Lips"" as well. I'm gonna sell my copy back to a used DVD store."
5,SUPER!,"Jimmy Hall can do it all! YOU may not have seen him lately, but he's working all the time. Next time you see Hank Williams Jr. out and about, look at who's playing sax & harmonica & backup singing. Then follow Gregg Allmann, and you'll see Jimmy front & center. (Gregg also performs ""Rendezvous"" on his ""Searching for Simplicity CD."") Jimmy's also on the Delbert McClinton Blues Cruises every January. The boy stays busy - just not in the pop limelight of VH1 and the like. Look for him in Nashville with The Prisoners of Love. I can't wait for his next project!!!"
3,THERE IS BETTER MATERIAL OUT THERE,"I LIKED JIMMIE HALLS VOCALS FROM WET WILLIE WAY BACK WHEN....I recently heard a love song from Jimmy and thought it was from this cd...When I read the reviews on this cd I was hood winked into the purchase ..but when I listened to it........I still love his vocal and harmionica playing but there is much better material out there for him to cover, I hope he records some better blues material"
5,GREATEST TIMING IN THE BUSINESS,"GREAT TO SEE JIMMY RECORDING AGAIN. TWO OF MY ALLTIME FAVORITE ALBUMS- ""TOUCH YOU"" AND ""CADDILAC TRACKS"" HAVE BEEN OUT OF PRINT FOR YEARS. HERES HOPING CAPRICORN WILL DIG THESE TO CLASSICS UP AND CD THEM."
5,This book got me hooked!,"'Ran Attacks' was my introduction to the Lum books. I've read two others since then, but 'Ran Attacks' remains my favorite. It is definitely one of, if not the funniest book in the series! When Lum's childhood friend/rival decides to be mean to her, anything can happen! Unfortunately, all Ran's mischief seems to center on poor Ataru! From Ataru being cloned, to Lum's ex fiance, Rei showing up, to the gods arriving to liven up a school party, absolutely anything can happen! I would definitely reccomend this book to anyone, but I would suggest reading 'The Perfect Collection' and 'The Return of Lum - Uresei Yatsura' first, to introduce you to the characters."
3,Too bad its a bootleg.,"As someone else noted this is a very poor quality bootleg dvd with no soundtrack and no sub titles. Although I truly enjoyed some of the historic images, however, if this dvd cost an extra 5or6 bucks and had some sort of ryme or reason it would've made a big difference. I'm into vintage films so quite a few images I've seen before (the lady who has her dress blow up for example) but on the whole I'm glad I've got it in my collection for the automobile parade alone, showing all these way out designs that people were experementing with.The 3 stars are due to the fact that there is a poor quality and NO EXPLANATION OF ANYTHING! QUITE WILLY NILLY! But oh do I love the era so. If your a true fan of old films you too can overlook this."
3,"The "" GOOD OLD DAYS ""","DVD shows when New York was "" THE CITY ""...when life was hard ,but, good. When people treated other people with respect and dignity. This DVD brings back a past that UNFORTUNETLY will never return."
2,disappointing,"Interesting film footage,but with problems.First off this is not a factory manufactured dvd,it is a bootleg dvd-r(This may be why the picture quality is so poor)There is also no music."
3,Tastes Great but expensive,"Very tasty,smooth, but expensive, for the small number of pieces in this bag, probably because of import costs. Lower the price and it would be even better"
4,"Deserves 5 stars, but I'm being whiny.","These are delicious. If you like chocolate anything, you'll probably like these. Smooth, creamy, deep chocolaty flavor. How can I only give it 4 stars and not 5?Well, I'm cranky, so that's reason enough. But mostly it is because they have a stupidly oversized bag for the amount of chocolates contained within. And that's a marketing/manufacturing ploy that always bugs me.Either fill the darn bag up, or make a smaller bag. We'll still buy it because chocolate. We just won't feel that deflated sense of disappointment when we open the bag and see a smattering of foil wrapped goodness at the bottom."
5,Fifth Column,This is one of Hemingway's lesser known works. A wondeful gift for those interested in his writings of the Spanish Civil War.
4,Educational Fiction,The Fifth Column part of the book is very entertaining. I enjoyed it more than the four stories. Give this book a chance if you have any interest in either the Spanish Civil War or Ernest Hemingway. Also try A SUN ALSO RISES. That book is good as well.
2,incorrect,"This was the wrong version, so i never got to use it :( i tried sending it back but no reply to my email."
3,Where's the rest?,"Disappointed that the very brief ""Journey to Transylvania"" (track four) is all that exists of the exciting theme that I enjoyed so much in the movie.(This was the exciting (and much longer!) bit of scoring in the sequence leading up to his encounter with the Hunchback in the opening half hour of the movie)*frown!* *sigh!*This will teach me not to buy in expectation of what I heard in the film."
3,"Highly overrated, yet efficient.","This score isn't so bad, yet it isn't so good either. The themes are overly repetitive and aren't complex. The main theme is yet efficient, representing a dark hero, just like batman. The Transylvania theme is powerful, rapid, and expresses more than well the action in the movie. The guitar has been very well used in that theme.In overall, it remains an average quality soundtrack, much like Hellboy and other big dumb action movie scores. It does remind Danny Elfman's style, and much of the themes reminds of the original Batman score put on steroids. I better like Batman, it was more well conceived, and the pain is more noticeable, while Van Helsing's seems a bit fake."
3,Good background music...,"I bought this because I really liked what I heard while I was watching the movie, but listening to the soundtrack by itself fell a little short of my expectations. There are some really moving pieces, like Van Helsing's theme during the opening title credits and a few others, but the cd works better as background music in the film. Alan Silvestri is a very talented composer and I also enjoyed his scores to The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, which are good background mood-setters for an Egyptian theme. I like using music while playing RPG's, so I'll get my money's worth out of the cd. Recommended to those who share similar interests."
4,"Bombastic, Energetic if a bit short score","I like Alan Silvestri. I especially like the work he did on The Mummy Returns and when I heard about Van Helsing I was reseanably sure that he would be back to score the film. I bought this cd upon its release and while the score that Silvestri wrote was different in many ways from the Mummy Returns, it was very good. It was indeed the high point of the movie. Silvestri was able to bring all the diverse and sometimes amnnoying elements of Summer's films into a cohesive whole. My complaint and the reason for 4 stars is that the cd was much too short. The Mummy Returns was over 70 minutes long Van Helsing was just over 40. To me it was a bit disappointing to not get more great music."
4,Great!,"This soundtrack is for people who liked the movie and those who didn't. It has the same fast pace as the film. I've REALLY enjoyed it. If I had to choose a favorite tract it would coem down to a toss up between ""All Hollows Eve"" and ""Journey to Transylvania""."
3,"Needs some contrast, too much head bludgeoning","Great sounds, but it never stops with the pounding. It all just becomes a headache about half way trhough. If there were places where it slowed down it would be so much more effective."
3,"Backround Music, not much more...","Though the soundtrack for Van Helsing is certainly good for the showy, flashy movie it was written for, I was disappointed in it's debue off the screen.WHile some of the themes, hold up well to the spirit of the movie and blend in well as backround effects, in a way that's all they are, as there is not much support here for anything else.The only song I particularly liked and could actually recall after listening to the CD even several times, was the Hallows Eve ball. Though that as exquisite as other works that I have heard, it was still very beautiful and the overall feel, is in a way memorable in it's own way.Though maybe most of the music can be condensed into two or three tracks (most of them are very repetitive), this is not the strongest CD to hold it's own by far. However, All Hallows Eve ball is VERY pretty and worth a listen."
5,best of the best,Walter Bruno did an excellent job of bringing an incredible experience to your ears.
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EQUINOX,"i bought this item to go in my 2006 stock equinox, and it's not compatible the plugs are differnt and don't fit!"
4,An Outstanding Piece of Analusis,Sarah Chayes gives a view of Afganistan which goes far beyond what we get in the usual media. She is a skilled detective and finds answers which the military and the State Department cannot.
1,Interesting but poorly written,"An utterly confusing account of the war in Afghanistan. Its merit is that it gives the reader a probably realistic impression of the complexity and intransparency of Afghan politics and history...nothing is what it seems. Its flaws are chronological disorder, personal grudges and reporter-centrism...(""look at me getting the real dope against all odds"" and ""look at me, the only sensitive observer"")."
5,Poignant Exposition of Failing Foreign Policy,"Sarah Chayes has crafted a powerful book that well explains why reconstruction in Afghanistan, after several years and the expenditure of much blood and treasure, languishes. She is scholarly in creating a narrative that describes the geo-political realities affecting the region, and intensely personal as she describes her own experiences resulting from those realities. Her journalistic prowess shines as she makes some necessary history lessons flow. Her access to key players and the personal danger with which she lives on a daily basis give her the gravitas to make ""Punishment of Virtue"" a serious indictment of those she places in her cross-hairs. Sarah Chayes has masterfully written a book that exposes the buffoonery and corruption in the rebuilding of a country that was and is the stage of revolving wars by proxy. If you have read Sheehan's ""Bright, Shining Lie"" about Viet Nam, you will experience deja vu as you read ""Punishment of Virtue""."
4,Thought Provoking Book on Afghanistan,"Sarah Chayes' provides an excellent look at America's post-9/11 involvment in Afghanistan. Chayes' portrayal of how Gul Agha Shirzai became the governor of Kandahar province and Hamid Karzai became the president of the country is thought provoking. Chayes neatly ties the history of Kandahar province to the creation of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 'The Punishment of Virtue' is a good supplement to the works of Thomas Barfield, Ahmad Rashid, and Steve Coll. The book is also an excellent parallel read with Rajiv Chandrasekaran's 'Little America.' I highly recommend this book when read in conjunction with some or all of the foregoing works on Afghanistan."
5,"A gripping narrative of intrigue, assassination, personal dedication and courage",Sarah Chayes' instinctive compassion builds friendships in Afghanistan that take her on a remarkable journey. Her insights illuminate the political currents affecting Afghanistan with exceptional clarity. This book is a must read for anyone seeking to understand the region.
5,Required reading for everyone - Especially policy makers!,"The Punishment of Virtue is one of the best books on Afghanistan. Sarah Chayes loves the people, understands their politics and takes no prisoners. Everyone who wants to truly understand the past and present of Afghanistan should read this book. Anyone who is making decisions about our policy in Afghanistan should be required to read this book! Sarah Chayes is honest, direct, and knows her subject."
3,the band afraid to show their better mellow side,"Before the epic Adam & Eve, CW threw us this bone to let us know that the Talk Talkish breakdown in ""black metallic"" was influential. It is clear that they thought mellow songs on their 1st 3 cds would scare folks off. I remember getting the highly abrasive Happy Days and being bummed that the scorching edge never really backed off. They can write great barn burners and I love that, but his b-sides comp showed us that the boys can really shiver our spines with less rocking ditties. Of course the next album, Adam & Eve, brought the house down and mixed all their ways into one.Check out ""Car"" for a great summing of Rob's inner voice. The Floyd cover is 2nd only to the original. Don't even mention the Telethon version. The hidden Rush cover works well too. The rocking songs near the end are over the top balls to the wall, dropping my review to 3 stars. Heal 2 is just Heal without the mellow parts."
3,Leftovers,"Great bands like Catherine Wheel are constantly creating music. Like Cats and Dogs is an attempt to fill in the gaps between recordings. This collection has some weak points but is worth the price for (formerly) rare gems like Harder Than I Am, Mouthful Of Air, Backwards Guitar, and Angelo Nero (not listed). Two other bonus tracks are also not listed on the CD's notes.[DW]"
1,Don't buy this,"Definitely one of the worst CD's I have in my collection. I've listened to it 6 times but never got to finish all songs. Boring to death. Their version of ""Wish you were here"" is just a black-and-white fotocopy. I give one star only because of the excellent artwork, or else it would have a 0."
4,The Christmas Box with Richard Thomas,it was just what I wanted no problems here The Christmas box is a delightful movie. Everyone should see this movie it is a wonderful movie that the whole family love. I watch repeatedly several times a week. Even though it isn't Christmas I still watch it. Come on and watch it you will get a kick out of it.
4,A good family film,Good family entertainment with a strong family message. Great acting by Richard Thomas. I would definitely recommend this movie. Well worth the money.
5,Richard Thomas is Not Jon-Boy in this Movie,"Of the films that I have seen with Maureen O'Hara, I think this was one that I truly did not expect to see. I have not seen her do such a terrific job in any other project she has been on. I also think that Annette O'Toole does a great job too. Her role in this reminds of her most recent one as Superboy's earth mom. They were very similar. As for Richard Thomas, I never really got into the Waltons that much, but I think he does a great job in this one. He is a great foil for Maureen and they duel with each other most of the way through, but when he learns of her true pain, he warms up to her just in time to tell her that he knows what the first gift of Christmas was."
4,spoiled at the end,I was pleased with the quality of the movie till the last 10 minutes which then it had intermittent lines going through the film. It was listed as very good quality and I did not find that at the end of the movie. was somewhat dissapointed to have to see the best part distorted. I even tried it on a another VCR and it did the same thing.
1,not satisfied,the tape did not play -- it was automatically eaten when i put it in the tv. It's a brand new tv w/a built in dvd and vhs player...we've played other tapes in it and had no problems :-(
5,The christmas box,This is a fantastic story in music. Loved it so much I purchased two more to give as gifts.
2,Not Totally Faithful to the book!!,"First of all I love the chistmas box the book. I have read it and re-read it. I also liked the other 2 books in the series. But i was dissapointed with this movie. I am not saying that its a bad movie but i think that it took most of what was special and magical and left it out. And also the book didn't take place in the 90's it took place in the 1940's. The acting was average nothing else. the only one to live up to the charater in the book was ms. O'toole as keri. I hope they someday make a more faithful movie also they changed little things that they had no reason to change. richard owned a formal wear co. not a ski company, and they didn't move from seattle."
4,Let Those Guitars Ring!,"In War and Peace you get Syd Straw's terrific singing voice backed by the Skeletons, a bar/garage band that rocks loud (much better here, I think, than on their own CD)and often. It's a great match. Straw rangs right up there with Amy Rigby and the Go-Go's in picking jerk boyfriends, but the music she makes of these broken relationships is often superb. The Toughest Girl in the World, Million Miles, CBGB, and Madrid are the best cuts, where her longing, anguished, and plain furious vocals soar against the rousing Skeletons guitars and drums to project a party-through-the heartache determination. All Things Change, Howl, and Black Squirrel fall considerably short of the rest of the 14 cuts, however. The latter two are particularly overwrought. Leave them off and you've got an eleven track 5-star classic. As it is, War and Peace is still powerful evidence of rock's ability to make even the bad times something good."
5,"She rocks, she lilts",Syd Straw has one of the great voices of rock n' roll. Her songwriting is at its best in this collection of memorable heartfelt songs. She rocks out on some numbers and breaks your heart on others. She sings with a combination of wit and sincerity entirely unique. The backing musicians and Straw's own guitar playing are excellent. A great record.
5,Haydn Going Fast,"As someone who has only recently begun seriously collecting classical CDs, the Bruno Walter Edition has been a revelation. Not only do many of the titles in this series offer Walter's ""Indian Summer"" recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, but they also feature many of the conductor's performances from the 1950s during his association with the New York Philharmonic. On this CD you get some of each -- a classic mono performance from 1953 with the NYPO of Haydn's 102nd Symphony, and Symphonies Nos. 88 and 100 in stereo with the CSO from 1961. I should conclude by saying that since making a point of acquiring all of the Bruno Walter Edition titles earlier this year, I have witnessed several of them falling prey to silent deletion. So order the Bruno Walter Edition titles quickly, because these recordings made during the twilight of Walter's career, seem to be in the twilight of their own life as well."
2,Too big and too heavy,"I was looking for a leather rolling laptop bag with room for clothing for a day's trip. This product looked really good but unfortunately when it arrived, it was too big, heavier than my pilot case and does not look elegant for a business woman.I had to return it. I wish the picture and information gave better indication of the size and weight."
3,'Z',"Interesting documentary about one of the first pay-tv services in America offers intriguing film clips from several beloved, obscure and notorious films. I didn't think anything could have me consider sitting through Michael Cimino's ""Heaven's Gate"" again, but it looked like another film entirely seen from this perspective. The documentary's main objective; a bio of famed 'Z' programmer Jerry Harvey, proves him to be an aggressive and heroic movie lover, but in the final analysis, he is only what his last act proves him to be. Aside from some manic behavior, it would seem some personal insight into the tragic outcome of his life could have been revealed. His unfortunate wife is regarded as a woman of no significance. As it is, the joy of movie-loving so intensely felt here, is overshadowed entirely by the meaningless, pitiful tragedy, akin to celebrating O.J. Simpson as a great sports hero."
2,MORE HOLLYWOOD INCEST,"Actor John Cassevete's kid made a documentary...about a guy who ran a tv station in the Hollywood area.Before this there have been documentaries even on Hollywood restaurants, and of course docudramas about Hollywood directors like Ed Wood.The offbeat film clips are nice.The programer for the z channel, the subject of this documentary, turned out to be a real scumbag---he killed his wife! Of course, if you can forgive Roman Polanski for raping a little girl, you can also feel sorry for this killer (he was having creative troubles with the channel).A 20 minute segment about this guy and the channel, on 60 MINUTES or 20/20, would have been enough.And, of course, Quentin Tarintino shows his bizarre face---enough of his giant jaw, too."
3,All That Heaven's Gate Jazz Was Still Boring,"Sure, I can understand how name film makers like Altman and company would feel an early career debt to the Z Channel's Harvey, even to the point of them now toasting a known murderer in this recent documentary.But I was there when Z Channel was on the air in LA in the '70s. I usually didn't keep subscribing to it because it cost extra as a ""premium"" channel. The timing of this documentray is horrible - it might have worked much better about 10 years ago. Wow, Z Channel ran films that we now all have on DVD. So what?That's like celebrating the fact that some guy was broadcasting color TV in the early '60s before it became the norm in the late '60s."
4,I wanna see More Z Channel,"I enjoyed the film, but it is truthfully lacking in that it has nothing from Z Channel. Where are the promos? Where are the intros to their festivals? What was it like to watch this special channel during its heyday? I would have enjoyed film clips if they were like the ""coming attractions"" run on the channel.This documentary can be made into a magazine article. But I do recommend it for viewing. I just wish it was more than talking heads and film clips."
3,"""The uncommon denominator, that is what we want. ""","Z Channel (a pay channel in 70's/80's L.A. which played an eclectic array of the world's finest cinema) sounds like a paradise for film lovers. Unfortunately this overly talkative documentary isn't so much about Z Channel itself as it is Jerry Harvey, the main guy behind the channel. I appreciate the fact that he put so much effort into the channel and had such a true love for cinema, but honestly he came off as an annoying, abusive type of guy who ended up murdering his wife before killing himself.The film clips are the best part (especially THE MOON'S OUR HOME and LE MAGNIFIQUE) and the interviews are fun, even Quentin Tarantino who flails around like he's having a seizure, but there's never any actual footage from Z Channel itself. Why not? Personally they could have cut the time about Jerry Harvey down to 5 minutes and had the rest about the films."
2,Disapointing,"I guess my disapoitment with the ballets have to do with my expectations from them. Both ballets are minor works of great russians composers; I had never seen them on stage or video. But the music appeals to me. Then, having a first experience based on poor soviet productions, where the emphasis is on big pannels and less in showing the best the dancers can perform is rather less than one should expect as a reference recording. It has all the vices of sovietic recorfings of ballets, and was badly edited for modern patterns. To me, it's value is purely bibliographical: compared to modern creative and/or sumptuous productions, it makes one think: What marvellous ballets Nureyev, or Ballachine, could have done of them!"
3,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this album. There are some good, chill jams with killer build ups. I particularly recommend the title track."
3,50-50,I ordered two of the same book and was disappointed that one came with paper cover and one did not. I would have ordered a book that had a paper cover from another provider if I'd known ahead of time. The book with the cover seemed in better condition and both were the same price.
1,Poor Quality Clipper,"Clipper shorted out after fifth use, unfortunately just out of warranty. Cost to repair $75. Wahl has NO repair facilities and NO product support. Must find an independent repair shop."
