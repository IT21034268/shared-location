2,Karaoke CD Tribute to the Beatles,I was overall happy with the purchase and the timing on delivery..however the product itself did not meet my satisfaction due to not working when I tried it out on my Karaoke machine. I do understand that sometimes there are items that do not work properly when purchased at a lower price ie: used items. Since I only payed a few dollars I don't feel that much of a loss but am a little disappointed that I am not able to sing my favorite bands songs like I had hoped. I will continue to make future purchases on Amazon anyway but will be careful about purchasing used items.
2,Definitely a disappointment,"The book goes into little detail about the practice, theory, or results of past life therapy. The 28 'case histories' promised are nothing of the sort - just dialogues from the various seminars Sutphen has given.The most irritating part is that some portions of the book really are intriguing - just enough to make you suspect that Sutphen really could write an exciting and valuable book on the subject. He's written many others I've never read, so perhaps he has. It isn't this one."
3,pretty,"This tablecloth was very nice and it looked beautiful on my table, however it was not at all the color depicted on either the website or on the packaging. It was much golder than shown, which I was okay with, but that others may not expect."
5,Great tool for discussion!,I have used this book with each of my four children. It opens the door to communication on what would otherwise perhaps be an awkward topic. I'm so thankful for this book and the others in the series that are each geared toward an appropriate age to discuss God's wonderful design for sexuality.
5,The best book series on the subject,With a christian focus this book series teaches in a respectful and moral way. We have used these books for years.
4,One size does not fit all families,"I was unprepared for the very personal style of the book: ""The sperm cell from which you grew was made in one of your father's testicles."" Some of my children are adopted, and the sperm cell that God used to make them was NOT made in one of their father's testicles. This can be a touchy area for some adoptive children."
5,WOW,"This has so much info in it, I am afraid it had a little too much for my 11 year old. She became a bit nervous at some things I thought she would not. I would not let a child read it alone, as suggested, until a parent has read it first and made sure there is nothing too mature for the individual child."
4,Brig of War,"Those who love nautical or maritime historical novels will find this Drinkwater series wonderful. Full of history, and a great ""yarn"" to go along with it. Very detailed about life on board during the time of the Napoleonic Wars and Admiral Lord Nelson. The series takes you all over, from England to Africa, the Red Sea, the Baltic and more. Also, quite historically accurate."
5,perfect,"Complements the flatware perfectly and, as is the flatware, beautiful simple design, well balanced, nice weight and perfect for everyday use as well as special occasions."
5,superb tribute to the rivers by Bethania - a companion piece to Mar de Sophia,"A companion cd to Mar de Sophia, 2006's Pirata finds the sixty year old Maria Bethania at the top of her powers. If Mar de Sophia was a tribute to the oceans, this one takes the rivers of Brazil and its surrounding folk mythology as its theme. A mostly acoustic album (Bethania's voice, guitar and drums are more than enough in most of the cd), almost all the songs are great, but if I have to name some it would be Santo Amaro, De Papo Pro Ar, Sereia de Agua Doce, Eu que nao sei quase nada do mar, Memoria dos Aguas, and Aguas de Cachoeira. Bethania's brother, the great Caetano Veloso, contributes with two songs written by him as well. Bethania's extraordinary voice, the beautiful songs, and the great art included inside the cd makes this one almost too much."
5,What an experience!,"Beautiful! Even though not as perfect as its companion CD, Mar de Sophia, still amazing. Bethania has not lost any of her beautiful voice, still sounds like she did when she was younger. And she's certainly smarter, picking the best repertoire, musicians, production and so forth. This themed album about a girl who has never seen the sea is a must. Buy it with Mar de Sophia (which is all about the sea) and you won't regret it!"
4,"""Cult"" is not quite accurate","It is odd to find a collection of schlock movies that does not contain at least one I have already seen or own. But it seems that somebody acquired a bunch of 60's -70's Crown International losers. I've not watched them all, but they are representative of the genre. Parents, please note that a lot of these drive-in flicks contained a fair amount of nudity (for the time) and that these should probably not be given to children. Although I am sure that 10 year old boys would be thrilled."
2,Call It An Education,"When these movies were made, you had to go to drive-in theaters or decrepit old movie houses to see this kind of junk. If you were lucky, you were necking instead of watching the movie. These are the kind of films that promised to thrill you with extreme violence, horror and/or nudity, and almost never delivered. Nowadays, this crap goes directly to dvd, or is made for cable, like the stuff on the sci-fi channel. I think this collection serves best as a time capsule of a bygone era for those who were trying to ""get lucky,"" too loaded to remember, in prison, or for the very inquisitive young film lover. As is usual for a Mill Creak release, it's a very mixed bag. Some are OK and some don't really belong in the set. None are what you'd call good. Worth whatever you're sucker enough to pay and not a penny more. ""The Teacher"" does deserve 4 stars for the nudity of a really hot nobody."
2,Oh these are baaaad,"There are bad movies, and there are 'bad, but watchable' movies... The majority of movies in this collection are bad. REALLY bad. Atrocious acting, bad audio, godawful direction and weak stories simply make them unbearable. I love schlocky movies, especially old cheesy sci-fi and classic horror. There's a line though. Cross the line, and you simply can't enjoy them. There's nothing to enjoy!Some of the movies in this collection appear to have been produced on nothing more than a Budget of $20 and a dare. Give me Ed Wood over this crap ANY day.There are only two 'bad, but watchable' movies in this entire set: ""The Hearse"" and ""Bloodlust"".And the title is misleading. These aren't cult hits, which it implies. These are unknown residue, movies scraped off the back floor. (Vienna sausages have a higher ranking in the sausage world!)"
1,Just offal!,"This collection is pure rubbish. With the exception of ""The Hearse"", these films are of college film class quality, costing less to make than your last haircut. Even if this collection were free, it would be a bad deal, considering the precious hours of your life you would waste watching these bombs."
2,Cult Schmult,"The best of the worst. Sub ""B"" movies. Entertaining none the less. Don't be taken in. The only thing they changed was the box and the title. If you have any 1950's horror movies you have these already. Same old tricks by the same old people. Man I am really getting tired of this poor business practice. Somebody in the industry needs to regulate this nonsense."
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS,MY HUSBAND LIKES HORROR MOVIES TO SLEEP BY.tHESE MOVIES WERE TOO COMPLICATED TO SLEEP TO. YOU NEED TO BE AWAKE TO VIEW THESE. ONLY MY OPINION. DEPENDS ON YOUR TASTE.
1,cheap smelling perfume,"I am tottallly not suprised that when I got this as an early hannukka present that it was going to smelll bad , and I was right when can jennifer lopez get that if she can't act what makes her think she can make good perfume it smells cheap and is not attractive what's so over"
5,love this fragrance,"I was so glad to find this product on Amazon. None of our local retailers carry it any longer, but I don't know why, I love this fragrance and so does anyone who smell it. I was really suprised at what a great deal I got! I was used to paying much more at the store, when I could actually find it. This is J Lo's best in my opinion. Once time a parent in my class asked what smelled so nice, and all my students burst out, it's our teacher, she always smells like that! How is that for a confirmation?"
4,"a new, attractive fragrance","We may not have everything the famous folk have but we can have JLo's fragrance, ""Still,"" which is luscious - sexy yet serene, light yet sensual.""Still"" is a floral scent with a difference - the bouquet includes, Freesia, Rose, Jasmine and Orange Blossom. Sound innocent? Not at all because there are hints of Sake, White Pepper, Sandalwood and Musk. An amazing combination.It comes in a jewel-like flacon, faceted it is reminiscent of an antique fragrance bottle.I would recommend it for both evening and day wear."
3,"bit ""nanna"" for me","After all the reviews I was tempted to buy without trying, lucky I didn't! After spraying it had a strong bathroom cleanser overtone, after warming up a bit it ended up settling into a smell that I can only describe as ""old lady"" or ""nanna"" (sorry nanna, I love you really!), not what I expected. Ended up buying Live Luxe instead which is lovely when it goes on and mellows to a lovely citrusy-sweet fragrance. Guess it depends on the natural chemicals on your skin, mine just didn't mix well with Still."
5,When you want to feel absolutely beautiful...,"When you want to feel absolutely beautiful...This is the parfum to wear...Jennifer Lopez has one of the best parfum on the market in my opinion. I am always complemented on my look and my style and I wear Still when I want to be my beautiful best! Buy it, you will love it too!"
3,nice but...too pricey,"Smells nice, lightly lingers, I just thought it was a little too pricey for the 1/2 hour that it stays on."
5,PERFECT GIFT!,I bought this as a birthday gift for my future daughter-in-law. It was the PERFECT GIFT! She absolutely loved it! AND she thought I was the best ever. She said I really 'outdid myself' this year. She also said it was one of her best birthdays ever - and I had made it happen! Thank YOU so much for the awesome product at a great price and super fast shipping!
4,Great gift for sister!!,I got this gift for my sister for Christmas..she luvvvvved it!!! sprays on strong and then gets light...very soft and pleasant smell; but remember every perfume smells different on every person!
5,A really interesting read,"This was a required text for a course on the history of modern China. I really enjoyed the book and looked forward to the assigned reading: the original documents (and the explanations accompanying them) gave real insight into China's history: cultural, political, and military."
4,Bette in true form!,This will always be my favorite Bette album. Music changes your mood and this one truly does. LOVE IT!
3,Software tough,"this product is okay, but the software templates are way too difficult to use. they should simplyfy this process to make it more friendly for user"
2,No good for wine labels,"Very dissappointed in how my labels came out, The labels sucked up the ink and were very drab in color."
3,Useful and entertaining,"The book contains many ready-to-use sales games, useful for training, coaching and team-building. All are well described and you can even customize many of them. The organization of the book follows the main moments in the sales process, making easy to spot the right exercise.It is a good tool and I recommend it."
2,I expected something workable,"My expectation from the big book of sales games was to find an informative book that can provide creative ideas for making training more enjoyable. However, the content was very ordinary and nothing creative. Especially, ideas on objections was not applicable."
2,Beautiful pictures - half the time,"We already have a Sony DVD player, this Samsung unit was purchased for another room. We were looking for a fairly cheap DVD player with decent picture quality and ease of use.The Samsung unit was easy to hook up, and worked very well with the first two DVDs. The picture was crisp and clear, the colors bright. I can't comment on the quality of the sound, since the unit was hooked up to a - to put it mildly - inferior sound system.Unfortunately, the initial favorable impression didn't last too long. The player has problems with about half the DVDs we have tried. The picture is fuzzy and very dark. With some DVDs it changes between the regular, good picture and the dark, fuzzy one.Bottom line: if the performance was consistent, we'd be very pleased with our purchase. It is not, and we aren't."
1,Decent sound but skips too often,I got this DVD player prior to xmas and soon discovered when I put in my first DVD that this DVD player has some serious latency problems. I don't know what's happening on the inside but every time I watch a Dvd or listen to a CD it stops. Then it makes a clicking noise like its trying to regain itself to continue then just freezes. I'm returning this thing tomorrow..also a friend of mine said his parents bought the same unit and had the same problems
4,Great DVD for the money,I got this from Amazon.com for $99 shipped to my door. It's been a great unit. Very clear picture. Some extra features and optical out.It has skipped on DVDs on occassion which is apparently due to bad chips or something and this has happened twice for no apparent reason.I've hooked it up to my Aiwa 580 Home Theater system and the 2 systems work great.For the money you can't beat this system.
3,good entry level dvd player,"this samsung model is a good value. while it's not the most consistent player on the market, for the price you pay you are getting a nice bargain. it froze up on one of the first movies we watched on it, but that might have been due to the fact that it was a blockbuster rental. basically, you get what you pay for. overall, its a nice dvd player for an even nicer price that you will enjoy for a long time."
1,Definitivamente un buen producto!,"He descubierto con mucha satisfacción que este es un muy buen producto, pensé que tendría algunos de los problemas que otras personas comentaban, sin embargo para ser justo, el DVD Player ha tenido un buen desempeño. Considero que los problemas de saltos se dan por fallas en los discos, pero no he tenido muchos problemas. Presenta una muy buena imagen y una nitidez y fidelidad normales."
5,It should always be this easy,"I took it out of the box, connected it to my system, turned it on, and started playing a DVD in 10 minutes. Really, I'm not kidding. It's very easy to use and the instruction manual, which is hardly necessary, is clearly written. Both picture and sound quality exceed my expectations. It plays all my DVD's perfectly, including one that had given my PC a lot of trouble. I had been putting off buying a DVD player due to analysis paralysis -- too many choices with a bewildering array of features, wondering which ones are compatible with my hardware and which ones would become obsolete, and finally settled on this inexpensive basic model, which turned out to be a totally successful purchase."
4,Samsung DVD-M101,"I bought the Samsung DVD-M101 DVD player to use in my bedroom and have been very pleased with it. For the money it is a very good buy. If you are looking for tons of features it really doesn't have that, but it has some cool stuff like 32X fast forward and Zoom feature that are nice. I was very pleased with the fact that when I brought it home and plugged it in it worked and played the new DVDs that I had. For a basic unit it works good."
2,Not too impressed,"I had high expectations after reading the reviews before me, but was not willing to pay the 45.00 for the used copies that rear their heads from time to time, so I made a pre-order with a set price. Naturally within a couple of weeks the order was filled.The songs are OK, but they are just more of what had already come on Metamorphosis, even to the point of using the same riffs and progressions. Metamorphosis is a far better album and should have been left to stand on its own rather than having the material re-used here."
2,Uninteresting and Gay,"I found this novel to be rather boring. Also, trying to follow it without reading the first novel was a bit of a challenge.Even with all of that it would have been ok, except for the gay aspect of the story. I'm not into gay literature, and would not have bought this if I had know ahead of time."
1,good prog- bad singing,i agree with many of the reviews below- the singing actually made me laugh- good music anyway- BAD singing- I heard from a friend that I should consider picking this album up- but after hearing about 3 or 4 tracks on internet radio i just cant do it- i just cant! stay away
1,WOW- so dissapointed,My buddy know i like prog music-all types- but this just didnt work for me- The singer id horrible- i agree with the rest- this music was OK- other reviews said it was great-- 1 1/2 stars
1,Mediocre,"Not that good- good music- bad, very bad vocals- i agree with some of the reviews below...... 1 1/2 stars"
2,GREAT MUSIC-HORRIFIC VOCALS!!!,"I love prog music- and all types of singers- from Geddy to Labrie- to well, a lot of vocals- NOVACT has some FREAKIN great riffs, and beats- BUT THE VOCALS ARE SO BAD!!!! This has to be one of the worst vocalists I have ever heard- I KNOW SOMEONE OUT THERE HAS TO AGREE WITH ME!!!"
5,EARWORMS ATTACK,"Vic Mizzy is a genius when it comes to composing ""earworms"", you know melodies that you just can't get out of your head even if you want to! To this day I can still sing Mr. Mizzy's public safety song I learned as a kid, ""Don't cross the street in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle of the block!"" So now this great songwriter who gave us, ""Da, Da, Da, Dum, Snap, Snap"" (Addams Family TV Theme) and ""Green Acres is the place to be"" (I bet you're singing them now), has a brand new album, ""Songs For The Jogging Crowd"" and after just one listening I have all these new earworms crawling around in my head. You will too. My favorite? The New Spider Man Song, of course. This record is a must buy from a true American Musical Master! Five Stars!"
4,Another Mizzy Masterpiece,"Who'd have thought that an eighty-something-year-old guy could be so hip? I picked this CD up on a lark, because I knew that Mizzy had written the ""Green Acres"" theme -- which I love -- and have really been enjoying the disc! It's retro and rollicking, kitschy and cool, and a blast! ""Name Dropping"" is a hysterical send-up of the ""it's not what you know, but who you know"" Hollywood name-game, even as ""When Your Dreams are Younger Than You"" is thoughtful and sweet. And the ""Spider-Man 2 Theme"" gives the original cartoon melody a run for the money! Admittedly, not every song is a winner, but neither young nor young-at-heart listeners will be disappointed. Two thumbs -- and big toes -- up!"
1,Great book if you already know what you're doing,"If you have already been using software to produce graphics then this book is for you. It would be a very useful reference to someone who knows what they want to do, but just doesn't know how to do it in Fireworks.As someone who has no background in graphics I did find some of the introductory material helpful. There is a solid explanation of vectors, bitmaps, gif, jpeg, etc.The problem is when you pick up the book and actually go to do something, there are large gaps in the basic information provided. To draw an analogy, its like finding out (in detail) how to hammer, saw, plane, sand and drill... and discovering that you still don't know how to build a bird house.The TIPS are really handy. I have the feeling I'll appreciate this book more when I have more training and can use it as a reference. I just wouldn't start out with it."
3,Advanced!,"I don't have much dance background, but I have never had any problems with the other 10 Minute Solution Dance CD's. This one is much more difficult and does not have much instruction included. I have been through it about six times and still don't have the steps down. I think it would be a good workout when (and if) I can go through the whole segment without having to rewind several times to figure out the steps."
2,Maybe I'm just not coordinated..,"I did my best, and will keep on using this, but the moves are really hard to follow.I don't have a dancing background at all, and that may be my mistake. I figured there would be more instruction on how to do the moves, but it was very minimal. Some of the segments are easier to follow than others. Of the 5, I think that Dancer's Silhoette was the easiest to follow."
3,good reference - not for beginners,I got this book to help fill in the blanks the other books had left out. It explained what it could and helped me to figure out the rest on my own. This book is definitely something to get if you are a serious web developer and need some help figuring things out.
4,Lowrider Jazz?,"The song ""Nubian Lady"" is classic slow r&b jazz. The song reminds me of driving around the ghetto at 3AM on a warm summer night. With windows down you creep from street to street taking in the nightly sights, sounds, and smells. The rest of the disc falls into the same r&b jazz category...some of it with an exotic feel. My only complaint is the cover of ""Hey Jude"".... it's simply awful. The sound quality is so bad that the inlay card for the CD says ""Dont adjust your sound system, adjust your mind."" I found it easier to adjust by skipping this track entirely. This album sounds very dated but that adds to the value of this music. The flutes and the electric piano are so tight. There are some strange vocals on a few songs but they aren't lyrical. These vocals only add to the dark ghetto mystique of this disc. Dont be afraid to check this out."
3,Looking back,"I bought this on vinyl for one dollar at a yard sale. It's rather nice to listen to, slow breakbeats and flute, guitar and strings. There's a nice head nodding rhythm to the tracks, while various people very nicely jam on the flute, etc. It's funky, and light. Something I'd listen to on a sunny day with the windows up. The hey Jude track isn't bad, and I didn't consider it to be too bad of recording quality. I was suprised at the quality of all the music, actually. I'm not familiar with lots of music from this era, but do listen to and collect all genres of music and this is a very welcome addition."
3,Thorough but overkill,"I absolutely agree with the review by Stephen Armstrong below. It doesn't take 50 - 100 problems for the average student to grasp a simple, basic algebraic concept. I see no reason for this book to be over 700 pages; the authors clearly ignored the need for simplicity and relevance in presenting their material. Of the several books I've used for algebra, this one has the most distracting presentation. It's hard to figure out what really matters and where the student should focus. And it's hard to discern how the concepts presented relate to each other. It seems that in the authors' desire to be thorough, they lost perspective."
1,Terrible,"This is not a good math book. It fails to explain many key concepts, and most of the illustrations and examples are not well explained. This book tries to do so much, and fails in practically every aspect.As one point the book says that using the quadratic formula is often tedious and a waste of time, and then goes on to spend the rest of the chapter using the quadratic formula. This is the kind of logic you should expect from this book."
5,Essential reading for aspiring journalists,"Leaving The Reader Behind: The Age Of Corporate Newspapering surveys a generation of relentless ""corporatization"" that has radically transformed journalism and newspaper publishing. Unprecedented in the 300 year history of American newspapers, the blitz of buying, selling, and consolidation of newspapers has effected the industry from small town weeklies to the nationally renowned dailies. Gene Roberts (an immensely respected newspaper reporter and editor) has provided the reader with a unique and documented history that is as engaging as it is informative. Leaving The Reader Behind is essential reading for aspiring journalists and students of American newspaper publishing."
4,Good Purchase,Pros:Great signal perfomanceGood life bateryGood volumen of earspeakerCons:Heavy*Be sure of the color phone because i'm purchased black but when i'open the box........surprise! RED PHONE!
5,As Expected,Rigid enough to protect photos. Item was exactly as expected--reviews and description were spot on. Would purchase again. Good product.
1,Not for the non-academic reader,"Very disappointing, requires in-depth knowledge of the subject matter to follow the story lines. Each sentence chock full of names and/or dates. Boring and difficult to comprehend for persons not already well versed in this field."
1,unhappy reader,"This book had a weak storyline. The book contains spelling, word usage, punctuation, syntax and grammatical errors on every page. The characters were flat and unreal; the dialogue stilted and boring. Every character sounded the same. This author has a great deal to learn about presentation of a book and telling a story. I probably won't read another book written by him."
4,Combat MUZIK,"Mobb Deep are one these duos where I could go out and buy the album without even listening to it, and know I'm going to get my money's worth. They haven't let me down yet. In a time when groups like Wu-Tang are few and far bewteen, the Infamous are in a class by themselves. This album deserves 4 1/2 stars. I've only given out two five star ratings ever: The Infamous by Mobb Deep & Forever by Wu-Tang (Ya gets none here Puffy!). It takes alot to get there and Murda Muzik was nipping at my heels. Gritty lyrics and tyte beats along with Prodigy and Havoc's QB style set them apart from the rest. It's "" DEEP. Deepa than Atlantis""! A MUST FOR THE REAL HIP-HOP fanatics!"
2,not the best way to say farewell,"mobb deep, the inevators of rap music right? wrong. another terrible rap record tried to pull up out of a slump by putting popular artists on there songs like Nas & Lil' Kim. i think that mobb deep should join every other rapper who is old and done for so that we don't have to be ""blessed"" with this brand of music. i can't believe that anyone would put an approval on this record, unless it was the same producer that worked with cam'ron. the track with lil' kim is blazin, but only because she is in it. and not for nothing she isn't no excellent artist either. i think that mobb deep should just throw in the towel, before they go bankrupt and don't sell another copy."
2,Dark Production...Street life,"This dunn style is played out with this album. I don't care if it went gold or what. This CD is not garbage, but Hell On Earth was boring too. I recommend buying Tragedy Khadafi's superb for-the-streets bootleg or even Screwball's Y2K if you wanna hear some original thug music from QB."
4,Bangin!,"Only 4 starz for being and Sp, not an LP. I have Quiet Storm on MP3, and I listen to it all the time. Bangin."
5,EXCELLENTE,"THIS JOINT IS HOT, I HAVENT EVEN HEARD IT YET, BUT IM SURE IT WILL BE TIGHT. THEY SHOULDA PUT SOME TRACKS FROM SOUNDTRACKS ON THIS ONE"
5,Good Cd,"I personally think this is the best Mobb Deep cd out there right now. I just got all of Mobb Deeps albums and The Infamous just can't match up to this. This infamous has only 3 or 4 songs which is worthy of being put on my ""New Stuff Burnt Cd"", while this album has a less ammount of interludes, and larger ammount of songs to listen to. There are two Quiet Storm songs ( the best Mobb Deep song made), It's Mine, Streets Raised Me, Adrenaline, and a whole bunch of others that make me go out and say that this is one of the top 50 cds ever made."
4,"Good, but not a ""must-cop""","This album contains some absolutely sick material, including ""Streets Raised Me"" which contains some reflection on P&Hav's upbringing. Spread Love, Quiet Storm, Its Mine f/Nas, Murda Muzik, Thug Muzik are all great tracks that any true Mobb fan will enjoy. My personal favorite however, is ""Im Going Out"" f/Lil' Cease which contains a great beat that sounds quite different from most other Mobb songs. Its worth buying, but don't expect The Infamous or Hell on Earth all over again. ""Murda Muzik"" is to ""The Infamous"" what Wu Tang's ""The W"" is to ""36 Chambers"": Good but not Flawless."
3,Not exactly what I thought,"Mafia rap is Mobb Deep.They are New York's gangsters,good storytellers of criminous situations.""The Infamous.."" is a classic album and a lot of their songs were underground hits.With this ""Murda Muzik"" their music..change in something.I don't know what and why,but ""MM"" hasn't got the same personality of other Mobb's noir works. Collabos are good,on top Nas,Kool G Rap,Raekwon and Cormega (Queensbridge rulez),but that 8Ball featuring is not all that.Havoc's poduction are like...not impressive,tired...Some track is totally classic like ""Quiet Storm"",legendary,or ""It's Mine"" with the boss Nas Escobar.But that raw sound is not in this album.If you want real Mobb Deep,buy ""The Infamous...""."
5,"mobb beats are phat!!!! a must buy cd, the best","his songs are so good, the beat to QUIET STORM is awesome i listen to it everyday, he tells it real on tha streets, buy this album now it f**kin rules!!!!"
3,THE INFAMOUS,"MOBB DEEP COMES THROUGH ON THIS ONE WITH JOINTS LIKE: IT'S MINE(FEATURING NAS),QUIET STORM,QUIET STORM REMIX(FEATURING LIL' KIM),WHERE YA FROM(FEATURING 8-BALL),AND STREETS RAISED ME(FEATURING BIG NOYD AND CHINKY)....THE ONLY THING THAT GETS ME IS THAT MOBB DEEP DID SOME SAMPLING ON THIS ONE,THERE BECOMING PUFFYS ON TRACKS SUCH AS: IT'S MINE(TAKEN FROM THE THEME FROM THE MOTION PICTURE ""SCARFACE"".) OVERALL THIS ALBUM IS HOTT! COPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP ITTTTTTTTT!"
3,its okay but not all that great,"when i read the online reviews i thought this would be the best cd out at the moment. guess what i was wrong, i only heard a few songs that i liked. it is good when youre just ridin around at night but other than that i think there are better things to buy. if you like underground better than southern rap then get it, but if youre used to cash money and no limit sounds stick with them instead."
4,Mobb's toned down LP,"Mobb Deep got to the point where The Infamous and Hell On Earth days took it's toll. May be it was a smart move to tone down, since this album went Platnium on the first week, with the club banging ""Quiet Storms"" and with third LP on a row where Nas and Raekwon made their cameos. But with many cuts like ""What's Ya Poison"" and ""Allustrious"" shows why we fell in love with the Mobb Deep. Also this was where we got full exposure of the Alchemist where he produced ""Thug Muzik"" and ""The Realest"" where Kool G Rap kicks it with the Mobb."
5,It's Murda For all other Rappers,I heard a few tracks off the album and they are BANGIN'. Everyone needs to pick this up. Off the Hook.
5,Nice,"This is a great album. It's late considering they said it would be out early spring 99. The album kept getting pushed back because of ""Boot Leggers"". It went so far back I almost forgot about getting it. It wasn't until I heard the remix I remembered they were dropping an album."
3,Mobb Sleep...,"This album was a bore. Throughout the whole album there was nothing significant except for the ""Quiet Storm"" tracks. Although, those are good beats, they're not gonna satisfy me for an hour. That concludes my expert oppinion."
2,There has gpt to be more to Queensbridge than this,"If Mobb had released ""Quiet Storm"" and its remix on a maxi-single, few would have bought this album. Even the most hardcore hip hop fan gets tired of hearing about MCs pumping crack, pulling guns, macking women and counting dough.Honestly, I bought this album just so I could sound intelligent when talking about east coast MCs with friends. I'll bump this for another month or until I get tired of hearing the beats. Then I'll trade it in for something else worthwhile. It's time for Mobb to evolve."
2,?,"Haven't I heard this album before? Maybe 3 times before? Or were those 3 times just other Mobb Deep albums. When I heard the Infamous I was amazed at how much potential they had. But then Juvenile Hell, Hell on Earth, and Murda Muzik a.k.a. Hell for the Listener. Potential that was once great is slowly being wasted and it is time for this duo to stop rhyming about cash ad killing, because they could issue a death threat to the President and not even the Secret Service would take notice. It's become time to stop taking the beats from their earlier albums and tinkering with them to make ones that sound like they will pass, and actually get back to work. Fellas, we have noticed that you are now too lazy to work in the studio."
2,No Sir,"This album is full of fake death threats. Big Deal, where's something we can feel? Buy MOP's latest tape ""First Family for Life""!"
5,"This one is just as hot as ""THE INFAMOUS""","Yo- To all the hip-hop heads world wide. This is comin from a cat who is in the army and in Bosnia right now. I Pre-ordered this one yo. I got the first single already ""WHITE LINES"". One of the hardest yet. Even when all of my peeps who aint got love for them make an exeption with that song. Watch out world Queens Bridge is tryin to hurt'em!Mad shout outs to Hav and Prod, do ya thing, thing!"
2,Not Agatha Christie's best,I suppose the short story format just doesn't lend itself well to mysteries. Mysteries need more length to give them any sort of depth and pull the reader in. If Agatha Christie couldn't write a good mystery short story then probably no one can.The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding was a total dud. The Mystery of the Spanish Chest was slightly better. My recommendation is to stick with Agatha Christie's full-length mysteries.
5,A must for Union organizers,"Sloane takes us on a journey through Hoffa's life. From his early childhood, to the end. Sloane spends time on Hoffa's relationship with Ferral Dobbs and the tactics and strategies that he learned in Minneapolis that Made Hoffa one of the most effective Union organizers of all time. This book literally cuts through the crap and vilification and shows Hoffa the man, the Union organizer, and the Union leader. A must read"
5,Exactly what my workplace needed,"I ordered these Avery Neon Assorted High Visibility Labels (5979) for small business use. The included colors (neon green, neon magenta, and neon yellow) are all blindingly bright and attention-getting--just what I was looking for. :)I used the suggested Avery Template 5160 and printed using a monochrome laser printer (HP Laserjet 1300). Each of the 15 sheets of labels printed out perfectly with no problems.I can't comment on how long the adhesive lasts since my workplace uses them only on paper statements which are then mailed out to our clients."
5,Hig! impact!,"The colors are very vibrant, and the adhesive seems to be of high quality thus far. I will be ordering more of these for my projects!"
4,"If you're a BSB fan, don't miss this!!","As a former BSB fan, whom owns the book, I still take a look at it from time to time, because it are honest and true facts of the boys their life before they became the Backstreet Boys and the beginning of it all. It has good pictures, but you can find them on almost every website and the biography must have been copied loads of times as well, so it's up to you!"
3,Best book in the world?,"I think it's going a little far saying this is the best book in the world. You might think you have to say that just because you're a Backstreet Boys fan, but trust me, there are better books. If you honestly think this is the best book in the world then you need to get out more.This book had good info on the boys. But there's only so much you can read about one group before you get bored. I suppose if you are one of those obsessed fans that can't get enough of them then you'll think this is the greatest piece of literature ever made, but otherwise you can only read it once.P.S. I am a Backstreet Boys fan, I just think some people are going too far saying this is the best book in the world."
4,cram pact with info,"hello people just a little note to help you out if you are thinking of buying this book. well for starters if you are thinking about it then its a good start. next if you are a new bsb fan you NEED this book. It is cramed full of info and pictures of the boys in there early stages. there is not a fact left out when it comes to how the boys got where they are today. So if you want to know all there is to know about how the boys met their first manager and how they nearly didn't get together then get this book. the bad thing about the book is that the pictures are a little dated, the boys look as if they are fresh out of nappies and in some of them they are in nappies but it is great to see how the boys have changed. well time to go but i hope this has helped i your decision. KEEP THE BACKSTREET PRIDE ALIVE LOTS OF HUGZ AND KISSEZ CAZ"
4,A Great Book for Every Backstreet Boys Fan,I wouldn't say it was the best book ever but it was fantastic. After reading the book I have learned so much about them. I loved reading how they all got started out in singing and how they grew up. I would have liked to read more about their present problems with each other and if they ever thought of quiting or anything else that is really personal. I would recommend this book to every Backstreet Boys fan because it has a lot of interviews from the Backstreet Boys aswell as their families. I love the book.
1,Money...,"Fast as a shark, we need to release this biography as fast as we can, in order to get more money while we're still famous! This probably is what caused a writer to write a biography about guys so youngwho are still in less than their fifth album! Unbeliavable! Money rules! The fans will buy anything from BSB !"
5,This book is Da BOMB!!!!!!,I think that this book gives a lot of information about the BSB I think that Nick Carter is so cut and he is my man
5,I couldnt belive how much I didnt know about them!!!!,"This book is a total must see for BSB fanatics!There was so much I just now learned after being a fan for 2 years. I couldnt get over how detailed the author was about their life stories.I used to look at them and think""wow!those guys are totally fine!""now whenever I see them on tv or a magazine,I have more respect for them.I recommend this book to a person thats wants to know more about them.And hey!,it really does pass time on an airplane,even if you hate flying ,like me!"
2,Great buy but seem stale and etc....,"We purchased this for our office. Seem like someone threw the bags around before they shipped them. The bags was intact but the m&m;'s was damaged. Then, they were not as fresh as a small pack you buy from a store.We ate them but doubt if we buy anymore.Delock"
5,Peanut M&Ms,You get exactly what you order- a giant bag of Peanut M&Ms;!Mine came in a pinch and seal bag so they stayed fresh. I was also fortunate enough enough to get free shipping which always helps.
4,"If you like female PIs, go to the source","Just as Dashiell Hammett invented the hard-boiled PI and paved the way for the future success of Chadler, Spillane, MacDonald, and others, so Marcia Muller created the equivalent concept of the female hard-boiled PI. Edwin is Muller's first novel, but her detective, Sharon McCone, springs to life fully formed and quite likeable. What's more, the book is actually a well-crafted mystery, a whodunit with very real clues and a killer not revealed until the very end (unlike some of Muller's inheritors, who seem to favor suspense over actual mystery). All in all, a very satisfying read, and especially interesting in light of it's status as originator. All you Paretsky and Grafton (and Cornell, etc) fans, give it a shot!"
4,Back to the beginning,"I was lucky enough to discover Marcia Muller and Sharon McCone almost at the beginning. I've followed her through all the series. Now that the early books are available, I've decided to go back and reread the whole series from beginning to end.I was surprised that it really doesn't seem ""dated"" at all. Even though there's no mention of things we expect in current mysteries like DNA, cell phones, or the Internet, this book still felt very much as if it could have been set now instead of over 30 years ago.It's a good solid mystery that has held up against the passage of time. For old time fans, it's fun to go back to the beginning. For new fans, it's the start of a great journey.So why only 4 stars? If this truly were the only book in the series that I'd read, I probably would have given it 5 stars. But I've read all the way to the end of the series, and I know she gets so much better!"
2,"Dumb, boring","A dumb, boring book - don't waste your money. I did and I regret it, had to force myself to finish."
2,this is a waste of money,iam 29 and using this product for two weeks. i seen that whenever i shampoo my hair with this product my hair looks little fuller and managable but the root cause of the problem gets even more worst. It sheds my hair in more quantities the next day when i wash it..This scars me a lot because i dont want to lose what i have right now. Been losing hair since i was 19 years old and it seems to me that i have MPB. and the only product works better for me is provillus and also hair regain shampoo and treatment. thats the best i seen so far. Prolexil treatment does wonders on my hair by regrowing my hairs back. but nisim is waste of money people. try prolexil and pronoxidil. its amazing result appers in 3 months
5,The best CD I have ever purchased,This CD is incredibly good. Bette is magnificant and the orchestration is excellent and HOT! I listen to it almost everynight and dance to every song until I about drop over.It is very emotionally charged and is just like a person isactually at the Concert.There should be more than 5 stars for this one.
3,The Rose,"The Rose is a beutiful song by Bette Midler and well done on this CD, but the other songs were not to my liking. I use The Rose for seminars and other retreat-like gathers and it stirs a lot of discussion.Carol Welp"
3,May not be to everyone's liking...,"I listened to this cd and my first impression that this is definitely not a cd that I will listen to very often. Bette Midler does an amazing job recreating a hard-driving performer. As a result, it is primarily a very loud, intense and jarring collection of songs with a few softer songs (""The Rose"" and an extremely sad version of ""Let Me Call You Sweetheart"").There is no question that Bette Midler is a multi-talented vocalist and actor.I bought the dvd of this movie also. Perhaps viewing the film and listening to the music directly in the context of the film is a better way to appreciate the overall end result. For me, the cd does not stand on its own merit as an appealing album."
5,Exellent.-.-,"Awesome gold plated converter... its full profesional style.. the price its ok,. not cheap,, well its, really good sound and no interference..."
1,Oh PUHLEEZE!!!!!!!,"Exactly WHAT is this supposed to be? It sounds like distorted Jungle Sounds. Has anyone even bothered to look up the definition of ""smegma""? In a word - it STINKS!"
1,Don't bother,"Contrary to the title, this book is not about ""writing"" a best-seller at all. Instead, it tells you how the author published his book using on-demand publishing and how he marketed it to sell copies. Unfortunately, the writing is amateurish and most of it reads like a commercial for the book he's still trying to push. The meat of the book (5 chapters' worth) takes up only the first 30 pages; the rest is a ""glossary"" of odds and ends including reviews of the author's book and -- for some unexplained reason -- the results produced when he did a search for the title online.If you've already written a book and are interested in publishing and marketing it at your own expense, then this book might help you the tiniest bit. If you need help fitting the writing process into a busy life, don't waste your time and money here."
1,"A big no, no","This book is a scam, a perfect example how the self-publishing industry can be discredited.It is not worth its money.The author takes pride that it wrote it in two weeks back in 2001 and the quality is similar.Out of the 121 pages of the book, only 31 are written by the author, the remaining are downloaded pages from internet and exerpts from his new book.I felt betrayed from buying this book and I would suggest Amazon should not promote this kind of books."
1,"Nice Looking, Accurate, but Problems with Bubbles","The level is nicely appointed, brass-edges, 6 accurate bubbles; however, I cannot recommend it.As noted in the Product Description, the bubble vials are replaceable. The first vial failed within a year and now I have only two remaining bubbles. And, the only place offering replacements is Stanley at $3.35 per bubble plus tax plus shipping. At the rate that these bubble vials fail, I could buy this level several times over.Note: I own several levels, all for much longer than this 42-321. None of them have replaceable vials and None of them have failed.I will be replacing this 42-321 with something more durable. But, it does look pretty on the wall..."
4,Not bad at all,"I got the wrong size, but was able to get adapters for cheep and worked out nice. Easy to install. about a 2hr job. Sounds nice. did set off my check light tho. for high rpm rev at idle, but it was the same rpm when i was stock, so i reset it. works good."
3,Acceptable noise level,This is a well built muffler but it is a bit louder than I was hoping for. Considering the price I can get used to the noise level.
4,Sherwood vanity - good product good company,Ordered two vanities to set on each end of vanity top with knee space in middle. I contacted the company with questions about getting 1 cabinet with drawers on the left side. They responded quickly and researched my question and gave me an answer quickly and offered to let me cancel my order since there weren't any with left side drawers. Assembly was quick and easy. Shipping was fast and I am satisfied with my purchase.
3,"No ""Box"" Set","When I purchased this item, I was replacing it with one that I lost in a recent disaster. My original purchase included 7 books and a box that housed the books. When my order arrived, I only received the books, and not the ""box"" that houses the books. I asked that the item be sent complete with the box. It was resent, and again came with the books only. Amazon did compensate a small percentage for not having the box to go along with the set, but I was not happy that the item was advertised as a box set.If you are epecting a box set, as is stated in the product description, you will not get it."
3,Pleasantly re-surprised but a bit repetitive,"I gave this disc a spin today to ponder whether I really wanted it in my collection or not. It had been a while since I last visited it, so I was already kind of leaning towards selling it. However, the opening punch of the drums and guitar almost 180'ed my opinion immediately. There's something refreshingly unique about the guitar tones, and I delighted in their fullness. As for the drums, along with vocals, this is where I would say the album might be a bit too droned out or repetitive. Also, the drums always stand out to me because Mr. Plouf taps away on the ride cymbal pretty much exclusively. ""Psychic Vampire"" is my favorite track."
4,A Wayne Dyer fan ...,"I am! A Wayne Dyer fan, but I am only rating this 4 because I feel it is more a summary of all his general thinking, nothing new. But as alway a great product from Wayne Dyer."
5,CANT NOBODY DO IT LIKE DANOIZ!,"DANOIZ HAS A HOT THANG GOING ON! IF YOU REMEMBER GOING TO THE PARK HANGIN WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY, EATIN CHITLINS AND GREENS, BARBEQUES, SKATING RINKS, ETC., YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD. I HAVE THEIR FIRST, BUT THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY BETTER! IT REMINDS ME OF MY YOUTH-JUST FUN FUN FUN! YOU GOTTA GET IT-HOW WE MASH IS THE BEST CUT. MIDWEST RAP IS GONNA TAKE OVER THE PLANET...LOOK OUT, OUTKAST-DANOIZ IS IN TOWN!!!"
5,Drop dabang,"WOW! What a cd i love it first because they are local from wichita ks. representing the midwest and there basslines are awesome. this is the first rap cd that i have have purchased where the bass player and yes i think they actually have a bass player, uses drop d. the killer tracks are 2,3,4,7,8,9,10,and 12. the so so tracks are 1 and 5. and the worst tracks are 6,11 and 13 though im starting to like 13. I just cant believe how an underground group can be so much better than all that stuff on the radio its great. BUY IT!"
1,"Items have not been received, ordered a month ago.",I have ordered these items (two music CD's) a month ago. I have not received the items yet (10-12-08). Not the service I expected.
3,Massive tablets,"You get 60 tablets...they are massive, the size of about three stacked quarters. If your dog is under 20 lbs, you will have to cut the tablet in half. I also purchased NaturVet Pleasant Breath Plus (same odor/color). They are much smaller tablets, more like a large aspirin, but I can't get my Maltese to eat them. I have seen both him and my Lhasa Apso eat these big Breath-eze tablets - eventually. I have cut a few in half and they may drop them in disinterest, but eventually eat them, maybe out of boredom? Either product does seem to cut the ""doggie breath"" - as long as you can get them to chew them up. My Maltese also specializes in the SBD gas (silent but deadly), so between their breath and that, I will be glad to have these on hand if I feel they are needed."
3,Pretty but Thin,Pretty sheets and price was good but they are very thin. I was surprised to read the other reviews stating that they were a heavy flannel. Mine are so loosely woven that I can almost see through them in spots. They are very soft though. I just hope they'll hold up.
5,Great buy!,I purchased these when they were a Gold Box special.What a great deal. I wish I'd bought a few more sets. 150 grams = 5 ounces. That is a nice heavy flannel.Very soft and warm too.
1,Just OK,"While the price was great, the sheets are not very soft, even using fabric softener, and I don't think I would buy another set. I can only hope they soften as they age."
3,"Entertaining, but not much more...","""Wild at Heart"" was different, but not what I wanted it to be. I was very excited by the idea of this book: A man living in the wild falling in love with the daughter of the man studying him. I thought that sounded so different and intriguing. Sadly, the idea was just barely touched upon and the uncivilized Michael was no wild man at all, but very civilized indeed. All in all, this book wasnt bad, but very mediocre. Not a keeper."
5,Poinant and practical - for the layman and theologian alike,"As a layman who has made the long journey away from Dispensational theology and read many books on the subject, I found this book to be one of the best on the subject. Crenshaw and Gunn have done a remarkable job in identifying and tackling foundational issues rather than focusing on the ancilary, and they do so in a way that is practical and understandable for the layman and yet challenging enough for those more studied. It is poinant in its exposure of the weaknesses of the Dispensational system (weaknesses seldom known to the lay Dispensationalist) but is balanced with compassion. Dispensationalists who read this book can't help but walk away with some difficult questions concerning key points of their theology. It is well worth the effort to find this out-of-print book. My only regret is that I didn't read it years ago. 10/29/01"
5,Perfect album for any ABBA fan!!,I am so glad to have purchased this CD! It's a very rare title to find and I'm happy to include it in my ABBA album collection.
2,agree with others - needs solutions manual - useless without,"I agree with those that say this book would be more useful if it came with solutions. Right off in the first chapter, hypothetical situations are presented without any background information in the text. If you haven't had some experience in Accounting, you are going to be left scratching your head. The instructor in my class says that it causes you to think. Hard to think if you have never come close to experiencing anything that is being discussed. Some guidance would be helpful."
5,I loved this book.,"Original, funny, a brilliant book by a brilliant journalist. It's been praised by people as wildly different as Janet Street-Porter, Christopher Hitchens, Julie Burchill, Victor Lewis-Smith and AN Wilson. They're right!This book is hilarious and a joy. The other reviewer is pretty obviosuly just bitter, Harri has been very successful very young, but on the evidence of this book and his writing in the Independent he seems to genuinely deserve it."
1,dreadful,"Derivative and unimaginative this book adds little to the debate about the monarchy. Reading like an extended undergraduate essay, it relies too heavily on secondary material and exposes Hari to the allegation that he has only written it to advance his career in journalism.There are simply better books to read on the subject and should you feel an urge to explore Hari's opinion on the subject he has repeated it in both The Independent and The New Statesman (both articles were in fact almost verbatim copies of each other).No wonder that John Pilger referred to him as a ""non-journalist"""

4,Nice keybord for its cost.,Nice keyboard for its cost but if you want to find more they dont make them anymore. I checked everywhere.
5,Perfect!,"Love me some Aretha and this album does not disappoint. I actually grew up to this album, as my parents had it on 8-track. Was very excited to find it and have enjoyed every minute and every track on there. Thanks for the memories..."
1,the worst popcorn popper in the entire world,"This popcorn maker is horrible, because it shoots all the unpoped kernals out before they have a chance to get hot! STAY AWAY! buy the poplite popper instead."
1,Absolute Crap,"This popcorn popper blows about 50% of all the corn into the bowl unpopped. It also blows hot kernels around the counter top. I am going to need to spend twice as much on popcorn kernels to get the same amount of popped corn that a product of actual quality would make.Do NOT buy this product, Toastmaster makes junk."
1,Possibly the worst product I've ever owned,"It's hard to believe that this was actually designed as a popcorn popper. If used as instructed very few kernels actually pop. The vast majority of them shoot across the room at high temperature and high speed, burning any small child or animal unfortunate enough to share a house with this infernal machine. This product makes me wish for negative stars.It's not just an awful popcorn popper. It's probably the worst thing I've ever owned. That includes a Yugo and a copy of ""Ishtar"" on VHS. It makes ANY other product sold by Amazon look good by comparison."
1,Not even as good as the other reviewers have said,"I have the Toastmaster TPC3 Hot Air Popcorn Popper, which appears to be identical to the TMPC4 that is discussed here. I primed my popper with 350 kernels (1/3 cup) of popcorn and ran it until it cleared. When I sorted through the resulting bowl of popcorn, I counted 228 un-popped kernels. That's a 65% failure rate. Just to validate the experiment, I put the 228 un-popped kernels into a microwave popping bowl, and (even though some of them had been half-cooked previously) all but 33 of them popped on the second try. The obvious design flaw of this contrivance is that each popping kernel propels about two other un-popped kernels out of the chute. The Toastmaster Hot Air Popper is essentially worthless."
1,Too bad negative stars is not an option,"If you are looking for an appliance that will entertain your entire family, this is the appliance for you.If you are looking for a popcorn popper - This is not the appliance you are looking for. I'm not even sure it can be called a popcorn popper. It pops about half the kernals, however, it does put on a magnificant display of flying popcorn and burning hot kernals (don't try to catch them)."
4,The first book I've read by Duncan.,"This is truly what I call an exciting and interesting fantasy .I could barely breath in the fight scenes ,and I was greatly intrigued by the way things worked in Chivial.It was slightly confusing at some points,but eventually I could figure it out .I finished this in a day .Here is the plot in more detail than the back will describe .There have been several attempts to assasinate the King ,but nobody knows who is causing them .Stalwart ,a knew member of the Kings Blades is sent on a breath taking quest to find the assasins .This is a really good book!"
2,A Disappointment,"Dave Duncan is truely an excellent writer, in the novel The Gilded Chain he demostrated his mastery of his craft. However, I was rather disappointed with this book. He was writing beautifully up until the end when he seemed to cut the story short. It sadden me, to see such a sudden end that was not as rich as the first half of the novel. Which, is why I can only rate this novel with 2 stars, since the ending just killed the story for me. A tale needs to keep the same pace throughout, and this just didn't."
4,"That Mystical, Magical Anna Riva","Ann has done it once again. Her small but informidable books are always full of information. I found the Modern Herbal Spellbook to be enlightening as well as easy to understand. This special spellbook is loaded with the basics,easy to follow instructions and herb listing their purposes for your spellcasting. If you are looking for some new and different spells and desire to create a little magick of your own I reccomend this book."
4,Good Read,"A well organized, well written book. I have been a nurse for 17 years and whenever I ever hear of a healthcare worker murdering those who depend on them so heavily, it just blows my mind! It just defies everything you were taught or learned.HOPEFULLY, the medical establishment has learned something from stories like this, and have ways to police it more QUICKLY than they did Shipman's case."
5,"Uncannily, creepily astounding.","The first five tracks on this disc are worth the price of the album. These tracks comprise the 1979 EP that takes you to the realm that is equal parts your own half-consciousness, the foggy, damp San Franscisco urban gloomsphere, and an acrid, sludgy soup that the Sleepers themselves bring to the recipe.Side note: Luckily for all of us, V. Vale had the foresight to document The Sleepers and their contemporaries in SEARCH & DESTROY form 1977-9, the 2-volume reprint of which should still be in print as of this writing..."
4,Classis '70 punk from San Francisco,Perhaps one of the best band of the first punk era of San Francisco.The CD includes all their first works.The first single was a good punk in the same level of Nuns and Avengers.The rest is new wave and it is less interested.
3,the description is a little misleading,"In the description it mentions a British blackade. I expected something like a blockade, but a bit funkier. The blackade did not deliver in this regard."
3,Alternatedly mind-numbing and thought-provoking,"The Bottom Line:A perfect example of why some things do not need to be expanded, this adaptation of a 55-minute TV show episode into a 85 minute film begins with one of the most boring sequences I've ever witnessed in a film (the director films through a yellow lens, for some reason, the main character walking around Poland for literally 20 minutes without saying more than 20 words) before Kieslowski moves on to a brutal murder and an exploration of the death penalty; at 55 minutes this would be compelling, but with the extra half hour I cannot recommend this leadenly paced film despite its interesting material in the latter half.2.5/4"
2,Broke quickly,"My son was ecstatic to receive this Iceman, but within a week it fell apart completely! Total bummer. Super glue not helping."
5,I see god,"This is a marvelous album. I've been listening to it for more years than I'd care to admit and have yet to get tired of it.Turner is matched with musicians who fit his style perfectly. Pete Johnson is always interesting, and Lawrence Brown's lyrical approach complements Turner's hard edge very well.If you haven't heard Joe Turner, this is a very good introduction. If you have heard him, you probably should own this album."
4,Kansas City through Fifties eyes,"Joe Turner's magnificent voice stars in this session, with some fine backing from his Thirties partner Pete Johnson and other great musicians, including some of the young stars of the mid-fifties. Perhaps the arrangements are a little restrictive but Joe Turner was at his peak and the horn players deliver distinctive solos. I particularly like Jimmy Nottingham's trumpet introduction to I Want a Little Girl and Pete Brown's rolling piano introduction to Cherry Red, that's real mood music!"
3,boss of the blues,i enjoy some of the music from that era also the cd well packaged and arrived bang on time thankyou.regards geoff.
4,Flowtech 50231FLT Purple Hornies 3-Hole Turnout Header Muffler,"Mufflers were awesome, packed well, no complaints there, only complaint is one of the mufflers was used.Had heavy soot from exhaust in both ends. the 3 hole bracket had marks where bolts where obviously tightend.When you sell something as new, it should be new, not used. Other one was great, new as described.To much money to send back so ill just have to hope it lasts,"
1,The fotos are nice...,I am a slobbering Rush fan but the writing in this book is just so...well...awful that I couldn't get past the first 25 pages or so.
3,Gift for my brother - he loved it.,My brother is a HUGE Rush fan - I'm not - he liked the book so I guess let's give it a three.
2,"""Contents Under Pressure"" could have used more ""Content""","I, too, have been waiting a long for a book about Rush. After all, they have been a very private collection of talented musicians. Perhaps this secretive position has helped fuel the production of this book.I was expecting to find more rare photos and deeper insights into the lives of one of the world's greatest bands. Instead, I found it repetitive. Not only where some of the sections repeated within the book, the contents were no different than what you could find on the web. Nearly every photo in the book was taken from some other publication, album liner or tour book. There was really nothing new.Overall, I found this book to be a huge disappointment."
1,did not recieve item,you better not have re charged me for this item that was cedited back for non delivery!! never recieved!!
1,Toilet paper,"Rush have a habit of authorizing swill. Their idea of new interviews are really just the usual casual, one line statements that we in fact, heard or read a thousand times in previous interviews. If you picked up the current R30 Tourbook or calendars, you don't need this for the pictures. They are the same. Oh yeah, even the website's pics are the same as these. If you are wanting to learn everything else there is to know short of dirt, then Merely Players is (was?) the book for you. There is no discussion of all their tourdates ever, cultural sightings, equipment, or comprehensive breakdown of lyrics. There is no list of Juno, Grammy, etc awards or honors (not even mentioned). If this was the last or only book available on Rush, people would say"
2,"Rush love-fest, very little meat here","Look for the quotes, the rest is garbage. Rush fans know what the albums are like, we don't need the over-dramatic descriptions of them. The pictures and quotes are worthy. The contributions by the author are worthless."
3,"Decent, but not great, book about Rush","This book is just ""OK"". It's certainly not a comprehensive history of Rush (and the author states as much in the introduction) - for that, you'd need that poorly written book by Bill B-whateverhisnameis that is now out of print. However, it does provide some interesting insight into the thoughts of the band members about each of their albums, and the recording and touring process. For a hard core Rush fan, there really isn't anything new here, but paradoxically, like me, you'll still want to own this book.The real highlight of this book are some of the excellent photos. The writing is sub-standard, but not horrible. This book holds your attention for about the first 1/4 or so, then it becomes somewhat boring. Definately a must for hard core Rush fans, but most others will probably be bored."
3,Good Review of Great Rock Band,"Martin Popoff's interviews of the members of Rush about their careers as musicians. As is usual, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart give candid comments about their music, recording methods, songs, records, and life on the road. And as is usual, their comments are informative, humours and insightful. No surprises here, just a good book for Rush fans, and as a fan of Rush, I encourage everyone to read this book and become Rush fans (and demand more airplay to Rush of your favorite radio station, especially new Rush music - okay, there, I said it; so sue me)."
3,"Not bad, not great","A decent book for avid Rush fans, although the writing style gets a little overdone. The author seems to be more interested in coming up with adjectives more than anything else. There are a lot of interesting tour stories, along with some terrific pictures."
5,a great book,"I thought I knew everything about Rush until I read this book.It gives detaied info on every album,tour stories,struggles,and likes and dislikes of each song.A must have for every Rush fan!"
2,Applying AutoCAD (R) 2000: A Step by Step Approach,"This manual, in my opinion, is only good for a drafter making the jump from R14 to 2000. This manual is not meant for a person that is new to ACAD or for a person looking for an in-depth manual. There are too many subjects that are covered inadequately. Some subjects are simply dismissed. I realize that it is difficult to cover ""it all"" but this manual doesn't even come close. Basically this: If you want to get by and say that you've gone though the manual and you know this book, you don't know much. If you want to learn much more of ""much"", read the manuals written by Shumaker/Madsen. They're much more in-depth and informative. I do not recommend this manual unless you are making the jump from R14 to 2000."
4,Enjoyable,Father has to work on daughters birthday so father takes daughter to lab with him while he works...accident happens... daughter is turned into something else. While Kurau is still human in apperance she is what they call Rynax. Rynax are a paired species but Kurau is alone. Fast forward ten years and even though her father insists she is dead some still believe Kurau is alive.Kurau coulb be perceived a gender confused boy which adds to a mature theme. She is not the busty type of woman that alot series have. You will not find the fan service type of anime here.I found this an interesting series and was glad I bought it but the replay value is not the greatest. I did like the fact that it is Thin-Pack but I do not care for Full Screen yet I bought it anyway.All being said it is 3 and half stars..it moves alittle slow at first but at disc three it really picks up.
4,Really good storyline...,"I've rated this to be 4 star for specific reasons.The story-line of this anime is based on more emotional sci-fi then it is to action/adventure.It has a unique twist in events that'll happen to a girl while going to see her father at work trying to develop a new source of energy.Again, this is more of an emotional anime, not action. It does look like it'll be action packed but it isn't.The soundtracks of this one are great imo. The price is low for all the episodes(24).It isn't too great once you've seen the first few episode where things really start to slow down.But the ending turned out what you'd never thought would've happened. Although it does show some clue as of what might."
1,Cheap for a reason,"I purchased this chalk box thinking that it was a good buy from a good company. I haven't had any other problems with other tools from Stanley, this was a lemon! Chalk doesn't rewind easily, and gets tangled regularly. The biggest pain is being a fulltime construction worker, it sits in my tool belt all day... and lets out chalk like somebody opened a faucet! Do not buy this chalk line for anything! I have since replaced it with a Irwin chalk box, and have been much happier. Stay away from this lemon!"
4,Bette's first disco LP,"Prior to this LP, Bette's previous attempt at disco was a remake of Sinatra's ""Strangers In The Night"" inthe style of Gloria Gaynor.This LP captures Bette at her most campiest""My Knight In Black Leather""(big gay club hit).Her I am woman hit ""Married Men"".Johnny Brisol's hit ""Hang On In There Baby"".To the sincere ballads ""Rain"" & James Taylor's ""Millworker"""
4,Bette does some disco,"Bette Midler's disco effort! Big Noise From Winnetka, My Knight in Black Leather, and her top 40 hit, Married Men are the disco dance tunes on this album. My Knight in Black Leather is definitely a guilty pleasure song, as is the entire album. You'll love the album, but definitely won't listen to it when others are around!! We all have albums and songs like that! Millworker, Cradle Days, and Rain are three absolutely stunning ballads. The album is worth the buy just for Cradle Days. This song is definitely one of the best Midler has ever recorded. Her voice does so much in this song. It's soft, it's edgy, and it's emotional. I think of it as a power ballad. The album is definitely worth the purchase!!!! If you love this Bette album, you'll love these other Bette albums: No Frills, Bette Midler. Support Bette Midler! Buy the album here! Don't buy from an auction or download the songs for free!"
4,Her Disco Album,This is a great CD/Album. It seems to be her disco album with many excellent songs. I recommend it for all Bette fans.
4,whispers and thighs holds it's own,"this album released in late 70's still holds it's own...some songs are timeless such as hang on in there baby, hurricane. the dance flavor of this release is still relevent today...even tho bette says knight in black leather was one of her 70's regrets it still rocks and is fun to hear..check this release out for bette at her dance best"
5,Bette's the BEST!,"This is an Outstanding CD! I give it five very big stars, and I will never get tired of listening to it! Go get it ASAP!"
3,OK BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I LOVE BETTE, SO I BOUGHT THIS CD AND I HAVE TO SAY IT IS A MIXED BAG. IF THEY WANTED TO DO A DISCO RECORD THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE A BIG BOLD CAMPY ONE THAT WOULD STILL BE INFAMOUS TODAY - I MEAN, DISCO AND BETTE WOULD HAVE GONE HAND AND HAND IN THE LATE 70S WHEN THIS LP WAS RELEASED. INSTEAD WE GET A FEW CAMPY DISCO SONGS AND SOME TRUELY STUNNING BALLADS - ALL IN ALL NOT BAD, BUT THIS LP HAS NO CONSISTANCY, BUT FOR BETTE FANS IT IS STILL A MUST."
5,Arguably the best Hotteterre recording yet.,"This is arguably the best Hotteterre Suites and Airs and Brunettes recording out there. It should be compared and contrasted with Phillipe Allain Dupres, another fine version, recording for additional perspective on early 18th century baroque French music. I am sorry to see this recording out of print and hope that it will be re-issued soon. In the meantime it is widely available on other sites."
4,perfect,Just what my wife wanted- A hit for the notetakers out there- a reasonable price to boot.You can't go wrong
2,barely scratches the surface,Disappointing. Rudy seemed to breeze in and out of Mexico without any thought to the vibrant culture and rich history. Staying in a 5 star hotel with a spa is not my idea of an enriching Mexican vacation!

5,speedy j rules,"as usual, a deep, distorted, high speed rumble through the speedy j insanity jungle.... you really have to hear it to get it. speedy j defines hard techno with this tricky, hard and fast track. all mixes are great. if you like speedy j, this is a must have."
3,Super bright!,"Used this on my daughter's hair, and it turned out really, really bright. It looks like we colored her hair with a highlighter! Which was fine for us, but if you really want a banana yellow, I would pass on this one."
2,Product was damaged,"Product came in a box properly packed with bubble wrap, but it was open and there was dye all over the box! I am unsure whether this was the sellers fault or just ups. It seems ups does not believe in handling packages very well"
5,Super Guide,"Peter has done a wonderful job with this - You get all the info of the tedious guided tour without the hassle and in the comfort of your own home. Then, you are prepared to do the walking tour full of knowledge and on your own terms without the tedious guide!We have not been to Rome is years and are looking forward even more after this ""preview"" tour and suggested walking tours. We have an apartment in Navona and this will all be easily adapted - Thanks again Peter"
2,"Disorganized, left us lacking.","We purchased this dvd, thinking it would give us a good background for our first trip to Rome. The contents were disorganized (too much time was spent skipping around) and the video left us lacking for a better overview of the sights(example: the Vatican & museum was not covered at all). As a result, we returned the dvd."
5,One of the best survival books ever published,"During my 25 year career with the U.S. Marshals Service, I became intimately familiar with many officer survival books. Without hesitation I can say that this book is one of the very best. The effort that Morris put into this book, to closely analyze situations that were fatal to lw enforcement officers, is close to without equal. If you are a street cop/patrol officer, and you have not read this book, you need to!"
4,Power adapters worked fine,used the units in germany and in egypt with out a problem. Used to recharge batteries for digital camera
4,Wow.,"I love this phone. The only problem that I have had with it is that some times the trackball gets stuck. Other than that it's the best phone that I have ever had. I would really suggest that if you need a beginner smart phone or need a new one that this is the route to go. Although some had concerns about the suretype keyboard, it's really easy to get used to. I added a typing game so that I could learn how to maneuver better around the keys and it helped a lot."
4,Love my phone,"I love this phone. I can actually SEE who's calling me and it allows for image and ringtone for each person in your address book. I'm over 50 so to be able to see the display is important to me. I don't use this phone to it's full functionality, but maybe if I take the time to figure out all the functions I will. The only problem I have is that the battery life isn't as good as my past phone, but I guess with everything it does, it eats the battery up quicker (my past phone did't do nearly as much as this one). The memory more than makes up for that!**Update 10/23/08, I've dropped the phone twice and it is now out of commission...it did last a while**"
4,What a GADGET!,"I really like my newBlackBerry 8100 White Pearl myFaves Phone (T-Mobile)! It's sleek, advanced features galor, and it's got that neat new EDGE technology! The only drawback is the keys are a bit small for people with larger hands and the calendar doesn't have a ""bi-weekly"" schedule setting. It's a very powerful device. I think it would make even Maxwell Smart say, ""Gee whiz!"""
1,Sketches of the iniquitous human,"How is it possible to write so many stories of nefarious behavior? No matter how splendid and likable the character appears in the beginning, Maugham will show you his or her selfish, malicious, perverted or twisted bent toward all or some select part of humanity. Something in the character's past, present or intent will evidence that all humans are stupid or depraved.I could not accept such contemptible scribble regarding my fellow man without falling into a depressed outlook. Why not choose to read something uplifting and joyful? And so I did."
5,Not Just for Sports Fans,"Because I'm from Bill Garrett's hometown, I thought I was familiar with his achievements. Not so. This book combines the elements of basketball, civil rights, and a cast of fascinating and determined characters with the story of how one small town's attitudes about race led to a revolution in Big 10 basketball and a contribution to the civil rights movement. . A great read that is not just for sports fans."
4,Getting Open,"It was great to re-live the ""glory days"" of 1947, and winning the""State"". It was sad and enlightening to read of all the racialproblems our team went through. And, even more so to read of allBill Garrett went through later. He was an inspiring, good person,besides being a basketball star and hero."
4,An enjoyable read,"If you liked ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" you will enjoy this book. It's not quite up to the same standard, but it's entertaining and contains memorable characters. Don't go in expecting it to top your list of favorite books or change your life, but if you're looking for a good piece of historical fiction, check it out."
2,Lacks Depth,"We had to read this book in our Language Arts class in 8th grade. While it had been the best book we had read so far, the story itself was missing many key ingredients. I think more discription would be neccessary. Vivdly describing Boston, Agawam, and the Indian settlement would have made the novel more interesting. A good example is John Steinbeck's The Peal. The lush descriptions form pictures in your mind. Also, the plot was dull and dusty. The style of writing did not thrill me and I felt that the story could have been a lot better if only the author tried harder."
1,"Knee-jerk, politically correct romantic drivel","Didn't you always know that the Puritans (who founded ""America"" and made much of the wealth we all benefit from possible) were narrow-minded bigots? Of course -- you've been told that your whole life.Did you know that these Puritans, in the name of their ""god,"" wiped out the native americans, out of greed and predjudice? Yup.Did you know that these native americans were very special people, with a special connection to ""the Earth?"" Of course.And that these Puritans were then, and their heirs (aren't we their heirs?) are now, bent on the destruction of all that is good on the Earth? Definitely.So, why don't you get your parents to give your house and your car and all the stuff you got at the mall back to these true Americans, and go back to Europe or whereever your ancestors came from so that this country can be returned to the Eden it was -- filled with very spiritual native americans who talk to animals and are environmentally aware?"
4,The book came in the condition described as I expected.,I did not find the poem I was looking for in the book as I expected. Not sellers problem as I did not research enough before I ordered.

5,Great product -- but cheaper at Home Depot,Got exactly what I was looking for and initially thought I had a great deal until I found the same level at Home Depot and Walmart for $4.00 less. All in all it really works great even if I paid a little extra. By the way the shipping was awesome arrived within 48 hours or purchasing it on-line.
3,Not as pictured,"Level is adequate for the job but was not the same level as pictured. The level is yellow. The add reads ""includes one 45"" but level does not. Arrived in HUGE box!"
5,Sturdy and reliable at a great price,This is a wonderful level: well-made and accurate. The only thing I'd like to see added are rulers on each side for easy measurement.
1,No measure marks,"The item i ordered was red, and the one i received was yellow. That would have been okay, except that this level had no measurement markings, although it is exactly 4ft long. It is not very useful without inch markings."
4,Mom Finds It Very Comfortable,"It's not cheap, but Mom finds this very comfortable in her wheelchair. If you are willing to spend the money, it is a big help."
5,"Sharp, lucid guidebook for overcoming social phobia","Rapee's book is short, clear,and simple, but it's a profound contribution to understanding and psychological treatment of social anxiety that focuses on every key aspect of treatment of this widespread, undertreated disorder. In a seamless, organized fashion, the author introduces perspectives and techniques that a social phobic can easily learn and practice.This work represents a foundation which will power up and significantly strengthen the potential of self-help for shyness and social anxiety. It is firmly grounded in cutting edge clinical research and was published concurrent with a scholarly volume on which it is based.Rapee's book may be used in or out of therapy. If the reader has a therapist who doesn't know how to relieve his social phobia, both client and therapist should get this book."
4,Based on cutting-edge research,"Well known for his research in the area of social anxiety, Dr. Rapee has written a small but powerful book on how to reduce the agony of living with social fears. Very useful."
5,homeowner best,"This little level is a best buy for hanging pictures, etc. Also magnetized 6"" on one side and slot for viewing horiz. Has vertical, horiz. and slant level bubbles all full sized."
5,Excellent first effort!,"This is the best first book by an author I have in I don't know how long. The plot is very well thought out, and kept me guessing for the longest time. It then also turned out I guessed wrong. I cannot wait to get a chance to read her newest book, Last Witness."
5,great,"great book , all the other reviews say it all .. took it on vaction , it was a great readi am starting her next book last witness this week , hope its as good"
3,Good for a first novel,"Good idea to have the suspect in custody almost from the first page of the book and then do some back-story and let people guess. But I got really tired of the way the lead character did nothing but stress and go without sleep, and get clammy and dizzy and go without food, and hyperventilate and zone out and tremble and freak. Sheesh. Get a grip. Noticed some surprisingly awkward sentence structure now and then that I thought an editor should have pointed out to Ms. Hoffman, but otherwise fairly good narrative for a first-timer.I agree that the killer became obvious a little too early on. I think the last scene was super-scary in the matter-of-fact way the killer went about preparing his tools, but was dragged out way too much as C.J. defended herself from him. I don't want to tell the end, but it should have stopped a bit sooner. Worth the read over all."
3,Good mindless but forgettable fun,"RETRIBUTION is one of the biggest debuts of the year so far. The reviews have been somewhat negative with a caution to the reader for graphic violence. Personally, it is not the violence that is the problem. It is the predictable plot and conclusion that mars this otherwise auspicious debut.C.J. Townsend is a state prosecutor in Miami. Her latest case is the prosecution of a man accused of being a particularly brutal serial killer. To forego the risk of giving away too much plot, suffice it to say that CJ soon realizes the suspect has a link to her past that she would rather forget.In spite of its flaws, RETRIBUTION is a fun and entertaining read. Characters are really not well rounded and many quite stereotypic. The plot is full of absurd coincidences and requires some suspension of belief by the reader. Violence is excessive. Nonetheless, as with many best selling books, it is good mindless but forgettable fun."
2,"Good premise, bad writing","I disagree that this story has been done before, in that this book has the twist of the woman who was raped confronting the rapist in a unique situation -- prosecuting him for an unrelated crime. In the hands of a better writer, I believe this could have been a riveting story; unfortunately, Ms. Hoffman is not a very good writer. Her prose is cliche, the characters one-dimensional and even the editing is terrible. The story line falls apart at the end, which was especially frustrating given that I had to force myself to finish this book! Don't waste your time. I'm sorry I did."
1,Long and wordy and of no interest whatsoever,"Climbing on the ""serial killer / gore"" bandwagon, J Hoffman gives an almost 500-page snore that reaches its confused, badly-written ending in about three pages.She can't even get the legal terminology correct: ""fruit of the poisonous tree""...! C'mon..!Don't buy."
1,Heart pounding????? NOT!!!,"I do not understand the 5 star reviews. This book lagged and lagged. The only good part of the book was ruined when I got restless (bored) and decided to read some of the other reviews, hoping maybe the book would get better. Unfortunately, I read the wrong review and found out the end."
1,Dreadful,"Believe the reviews that tell you this book is a waste of your money. The writing quality is poor. The plot is predictable when it isn't simply ridiculous. The characterization is thin. The heroine is poorly drawn, and what little you learn of her is unworthy of admiration.Take a miss."
2,Been done before ...,"I agree with other reviewers that this story has been done already ... and definitely done better. I finished the book, but really felt it was a waste of time.I'm especially disappointed because I bought this book based on the favorable pre-publication reviews. It really drives home the point that the marketing of a book is being crucial to its success."
2,Five stars?! What is the world coming to?,"This book is violent in the most graphic, sadistic, and deviant way. But I guess that's a selling feature, huh?"
2,Same old; same old BUT great writing!,"This story has been told thousands of times in the same way. Smart woman get raped, falls in love with police investigator, rapist almost gets away...Ms. Hoffman is a wonderful writer; all she needs now is a good story!"
1,Without redemption,"I keep hearing this is a good novel for a first effort, but that would be more appropriate for a publisher's rejection letter, not for a published book.This book is raw and badly written. The characters are completely without redeeming features, even the victims, which is what you will be if you pay for this book. If you must read this, use your library card and save your money."
4,Wonderful debut novel,I was enthralled at the quality of writing in this debut novel by a very talented Prosecutor turned author. The story is long yet captivating. The author kept the reader guessing as to the ending. I was very involved in the characters. I highly recommend this book.
4,"Suspenseful, but with a weak ending","I thought the first half of this book was great, especially the part set in New York. Hoffman did an excellent job with the emotions associated with being raped and how it turns your life upside down. A little over half way through the book, however, I found that it degenerated. It was still better than many suspense thrillers, but I had hoped for a better ending. Having said that, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes graphic thrillers.One more thing, I get bored by the constant turf wars between police departments and the FBI that seem to make their way into every thriller. It's such a tired story, almost as tired as the relentless media and the obnoxious reporter. To me, it's just wasted space - the testosterone filled men who fight for jurisdiction - and I usually skip those parts of the story, because they are so predictable."
5,Very scary - nightmare scary!,"This book is powerfully written - an amazing book for a debut! I won't go into the synopsis since so many others have already done so. Let's just say that this book gave me nightmares. Stephen King, Dean Koontz and Thomas Harris didn't manage to accomplish that."
1,in contention for the worst book I have ever read.,"The story is so incredibly implausible and the book so badly written that I want my money and my time back. There was not one realistically drawn character -they were all flat, boring stereotypes. Very little of the thin plot held my attention, the settings were invisible, the cliches everywhere, and I really could have turned the poor grammar and editing blunders into a drinking game...of course I'd be hospitalized by now. This book is a mess."
1,WORST BOOK OF THE YEAR,"If you want to read a book with NO suspense, NO action, lots of BORING CHAPTERS that don't lead anywhere - and if you're in the moods for lots of wonderfuly bad writing (and man is it bad), well, this book is for you. Has to be one of the worst books I've read to date. Great opening chapter leads no where. I have no idea where the positive reviews are coming from because, honestly, this is really, really bad. If you must read this, check it out from the library."
2,Not for fans of literate mysteries,"It's obvious by the reviews that readers either love this book or feel it was not as good as its hype. Put me in the latter category. I'll grant that the story line was fairly interesting -- who doesn't love a story of revenge? But the writing was hackneyed (...) and the dialog embarrassingly awkward, particularly the rapist's internal dialog as he awaited his victim (""Yum yum"" as I recall). In the hands of Scott Turow or Dennis Lehane this would have been a much more satisfying novel."
1,Disappointment of the year,"Jilliane Hoffman's ""Retribution"" is being hyped as the most enthralling debut since Scott Turow's ""Presumed Innocent."" I fell for the bait, but hope to save others from the same mistake. While Hoffman and Turow share a background in the legal system, the key difference is that Turow is a superb writer. Hoffman, sadly, should have kept her day job: she can't write at all. Her characters are one-dimensional at best (and that dimension is uniformly unpleasant). Her pace is plodding, and there are so many upscale brand names studding the pages that she apparently has mistaken them for adjectives and nouns. (No one answers a cell phone in this book; they ""pick up the Nextel."") The touted plot twists are telegraphed from the get-go. The protagonists' blatant racism and homophobia, and the gratuitous sadism of the crimes, only add to the bad taste this book leaves behind. Skip it!"
1,NOT GREAT DICE,"These dice are totally wonky for the most part. over half of them either have messed up sides (aka arent flat) or the dots look weird. if you dont care for quality then i guess buy them, otherwise stay away"
2,Dice aren't nice,"Bought these dice for inclusion with a game that I have developed. They were priced right. Upon receiving the dice, I noticed that some of the white dots (Known as PIPs) were smeared or off center. The plastic cubes also had indentations, or sink holes on a side probably from the injection process. What these dice looked like overall was that they were factory 2nds bought from the manufacturer at a dirt cheap price (no doubt from China) and used for re-sale to people like me. They are okay for little kids, but definately low quality. It was not worth it to pay to ship them back, so I bit the bullet and now sort through the bunch looking for good sets of 2. Would I buy these again? No. The return policy was great, but it wasn't worth paying the freight."
4,Great value but sides are not perfectly flat,"Was doing a large group game night at my church for middle school kids. Had a station for Minute To Win It style games. We did the balancing of 6 dice on the end of a popsicle stick while being held in the players mouth. Great game but very difficult. These dice worked well but added an extra level of difficulty because the sides aren't perfectly flat. Stacking was hard because the dice wouldn't sit evenly on top of each other; however, several of the kids were able to complete the game in under 60 seconds. If you're doing something similar, just keep in mind the dice are a little uneven; however, you can't beat the price for 100 dice. Hope that helps others."
1,Very Low Quality,"There are 100 19mm 6 sided red dice. They are in crappy condition. The look like they've been rolled around in sand and gravel, covered in chips and scratches. They are also very poorly made. The pips are already losing paint and they are out of proportion with the rest of the dice. I would rather not have these dice. I would rather have a box of rocks."
1,Junk,"These dice are awful! They are not square, all of them are rounded or have dips and they chip very easily. Save your money."
3,not as good as I'd hoped,"I ordered these dice to use with elementary math students. They are great for young students learning math skills. I needed quite a few, so I ordered this set of 100.They are a good size and weight, however I am disappointed with the quality. There are 17 dice in the package that are not useable. The white dots painted on the dice are very sloppy. There are many dice with extra splotches of white paint so the students can't count the dots correctly. Some have white paint that almost covers a whole side. There are enough for me to use and I need them now so I won't return them, but I am disappointed."
3,Roll Of The Dice,"I recently purchased these dice from this seller. When I inspected them I was displeased to find that they were mostly, if not all slightly defective: A lot of the pips were misaligned and poorly colored in. On the plus side they appeared to be new and have 6 sides, and the price was good. I think the seller should have at least disclosed that these dice had slight imperfections."
3,Not high quality,"As other reviewers have mentioned, these dice are not the highest quality. Some of the sides are uneven and bent outwards. That being said, this a good, cheap set if you aren't playing that seriously. Just take out the more noticeably uneven dice, and they work well for lighthearted games, and for kids."
2,"Really cheaply made, defects in most","As some other reviewers said, almost all of mine had defects. They appear clear in the picture but they are not when they arrive. They seem all scratched up."
5,Great deal.,I ordered these dice to use in round bowls with floating candles for Vegas style party centerpieces. They arrived quickly and were in perfect condition. I highly recommend them.
2,Extremely large dice.,I ordered these dice to play with dice cup for a fun night of liar the game. Sadly when they arrived to my home they appeared to have been used. The dice were warn & scraped up. Also they are very large barely fit into a dice cup. Much larger then the ones that would come in your average board (16mm) these are (19mm) much larger then what I was expecting. I did my research never realized there were different sized dice. So I hope this helps the normal dice I'm used to & you may be used to are 16mm these that I am speaking about are 19mm much bigger I noticed the difference when I first took them out the packaging. I ordered some other dice 12mm much smaller but they look great & are a perfect size for any dice cup u might have.
2,Very lopsided,Super cheap so I cant complain as these were essentially table decorations for a casino themed event but man they are lumpy and crooked. I would be embarassed to use these in a game of anything.
2,All dices are used and some has missing faces,"The dice are not all new. Most of them are used and have missing faces and extra faces. But if used carelessly for outdoor or picnic games, these dice will do the job. Just don't expect all of them to be in perfect condition."
3,Dots,Most of the die were perfect. But there some that had one or more sides lacking paint in the indented dots.
3,I was disappointed but my 3-year old likes it!,"I bought this book after reading the enthusiastic and nostalgic reviews from other customers who said they loved this book as children. Personally, I don't get what all the fuss is about -- the story really isn't very interesting. I also think the book is wordy for a preschooler to sit through (I end up having to edit most of the text on the fly). My daughter has become attached to the book, however, mainly because she likes the part where, POW! Mr. Pine gets knocked off the ladder."
5,Returning to the Purple House,"Mr. Pine's Purple House is one of the few books I remember from my childhood, and with the way things are these days, I wanted to return to that innocence for a moment. It was a ""guilty pleasure"" if you will and one that I enjoyed. It may be simple by today's standards, but if you have young children I would suggest sharing it with them as it speaks to the child about creativity and individuality. And those are two great qualities to nurture in your children."
5,One of our favorite stories....,We have had this book for our children and now are buying it for our grandchildren.....it is a keeper.....
5,"My favorite, to date.","This is the book I requested night after night, month after month, year after year. I can't remember the words anymore, but the theme has stayed with me through out the years. My house is mauve though, but that will all change when I become a home owner."
4,A wonderful story but illustrations are too small,"When I saw this book was available, I HAD to order it for my son because I have such fond memories of reading this book as a child. It is a wonderful story--a little bit silly and captivating to a young child with a good message about individuality. My son now loves the story too. The only disappointment is that this edition is considerably smaller than the version I remember reading so it seems that the illustrations were shrunk down to fit on the page. For example, there is one page in the text where Mr. Pine plants a bush next to his pine tree to differentiate his house and wakes up to find that all 50 houses on his street now also have a bush next to their little pine tree. The problem is that you have to practically squint to make out what are supposed to be the bushes and the trees. Even so, I still love this story because of its sentimental value and am happy to own it."
4,Cute story,"Mr. Pine has a problem. He can't tell his house from everybody else's.So he tries one thing, and another, but people keep copying his good ideas! Finally he gets the idea to paint his house purple, and after a few mishaps he does - and starts a trend to paint houses all sorts of strange colors. But only one of them is purple :)It's a cute story, though a little wordy for a read-aloud."
5,Sentimental favorite,"Here's a charming children's classic that stuck with me though the (many!) decades since my parents were reading it to me. it carries a wonderful message about the perils of over-conformity, and plants seeds in a kid's mind about such things as creativity, problem-solving, and courage that could help them develop natural defenses against the harmful effects of our troubled society."
5,Old but Good!,My daughter is 33 and has loved this book as long as she could read! I bought it for her for Christmas because she is now going to pass it on to her own child who will be born soon!
5,Classic Live Recording,I've owned a copy of this since it came out. I have always enjoyed the sonic quality especially the fade out at the end of Suppers Ready. Miss Peter here but Phil proves he is a suitable replacement. This is before he became a circus sideshow.
5,My favorite CD,"This is the third time I've purchased this album in my life; first vinyl, then CD, and now CD again because the kids lost one of the disks. It is my favorite album of all times. One of the 3 best concerts I ever saw (1978), surpassed only by Led Zeppelin and UFO."
5,Great album,I last listened to this album back on an LP in the 1980's.. Wow the cd is clear.. A whole new experience! Worthwhile!
4,Putting the classic into rock,"4 1/2Still strong enough to be a prime example of art-rock performance at its absolute finest, besides from offering stunningly accurate renditions of mid-career classics the band brings out enough vitality in these performances so as to surpass many of the flatter originals."
5,Simply beautiful music...,"From the mind-blowing sounds of Steve Hackett's guitar on Dance on a Volcano and Robbery, Assualt and Battery to the frightneing accuracy of Tony Bank's synth, this album has to be, in my opinion, Genesis' finest. And just to ensure that no other of their albums comes even close, they throw in the 23 minute Supper's Ready to polish things off.I have to say that i was certainly surprised to find that Phil Collins performed the keyboard solos in both Robbery, Assualt and Battery and The Cinema Show, which are both astounding songs in their own right, their beauty accentuated here.I may be only 16 years old, but i appreciate their music tremendously - especially from the post-Gabriel period onward to the departure of Hackett. This album encapsulates everything great about Genesis on a double CD."
2,Remastered Edition ? quite disapointing sound,"I wanted to purchase this album for enjoying Genesis while driving (having the good old LP's) but as for other Genesis so-called ""definitive remastered edition"" I am very disapointed with the ""flatening"" effect of the end result : all guitars from Steve Hackett that are usually so crystal-clear and play like watermarks over Tony Banks keyboards are ""drowned"" into a melting pot and even the famous drums solo duo looks like an anemic copy of the first recording.Too bad as well that the CD cover inlay does not include more infos, or a small booklet to give more infos for the ""definitive edition"" : in fact there are less than the original album (some pictures have been thrown away)My advise : this album is great, but aim for the non final mix edition or better catch the LP's if you can"
3,Beauty and bombast,"3 1/2Engaging-annoying modern classical requiem at best recalls Part's beautiful minimalism, but at worst sounds like symphonic rock. Somewhere in the middle Jenkins' composes and conducts enough choral-driven tragic splendor to warrant hearing the darkened celebration."
3,A worthwhile book on what it takes to hike the AT,"I wondored how the author could make a typical day, week or month on the AT into an engaging book that would keep my attention to the very end. Mr. Curran does it successfully through insightful experiences on the day to day life of a thru-hiker on the AT. I must say though, the book gives you the idea that he is going to describe his trip from Spring Mountain, Georgia all the way to Mt. Katahdin, Maine. I was dissappointed to find that only half the journey was to be shared"
4,"The Appalachian Trail, A Journey of Discovery","A very good description of the sights and scenery along the AT and the personal and emotional impacts of the psychological highs and lows of a long distance hike. It is written with exceptional clarity and sensitivity which I found to be delightful. I especially liked the poetry which, although not to be confused with Yeats or W. H. Auden, nonethless adds to the enjoyment of the reading. I have read a number of books on hiking by a number of authors and this is one of the very best."
2,Hard to Sit Through,Male menopause is correct. I do not comprehend how the author made it. Dont' waste your time unless are like me and just read everything about the AT you can get your hands on. This book is poorly written and long-winded.
5,"oh, what an album...","Like a previous reviewer noted, this album is truly a ""plug-and-play"" album--one of those one-in-every-hundred (or more) albums whose every track is able to stand on its own as a fully-realized piece of artistic perfection. Everything here is flawless, from the deep-down-in-your-bones melody to Ms. Flack's incomparable voice and brilliant delivery (backed up by an exquisitely spare production). This album is one of the great monuments to human sadness, best enjoyed (perhaped ""cherished"" would be a better word) alone and with a willingness to feel good feeling sad."
4,GREAT DEBUT,"The songs on this album are not typical of the smoother kind of material Flack would be singing in the 1970s. It's a jazz crossover featuring respected sidemen, who create a sound that sweeps, lifts and lulls. 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face' only serves as the door. Open it."
1,Terrible Sound Quality!,"What a disappointment! I had this album years ago, and absolutely loved it. Was excited to find it offered on CD through Amazon by the seller NAGIRY, and was eager to hear it again--assuming that the sound quality would at LEAST be as good as my LP had been. To my disgust, the CD sounds like an amateur rip-off recording of an old scratchy LP made with a cheap one-track tape recorder. For anyone who loves Roberta Flack--DON'T BUY FIRST TAKE ON CD FROM THIS SELLER!!!"
4,Roberta Flack's First Is Her Best,"""First Take"" is Roberta Flack's best album. Listening to it, you can see why she created a real stir in her early days. Intelligence, artistry, a jazz AND folk sensibility, deeply held passion, and spirituality are just a few words to describe what that amazing brand new voice was bringing to the table. It must've been amazing to hear her in a small club in those days before she hit it big and got somewhat swallowed up by that great big pop maw. ""Compared To What"" is a fine opener to an album that keeps a very organic and sustained tone throughout, but the real payoff here is ""I Told Jesus"". Absolutely mind-blowing, it will take you someplace that will send shivers up and down your spine. Listen to it in a darkened room alone with your - and her - thoughts."
3,I'VE DONE THE WRONG THING ALL MY LIFE,"This is a cop drama/mystery/thriller?/ spoof? that takes place in the part of Berlin where everyone speaks English. Alex ( Armin Mueller-Stahl) is an old cop that people run away from as if he is a super cop. He has a dry sense of humor to him. While he is hunting a crime boss, a woman over doses on heroin. This leads him into the arena of drugs and brothels. He works with an assistant he doesn't initially like which adds to the dry humor.Beck beer and Marlboro Lights product placement. People are heavy smokers, in fact a woman smokes while she is eating soup. There is some jazz detective music, but this is far from anything noir. While the film is not laugh out loud funny, it appears to have some humor we normally find in indie films.The plot is not that great. The dry humor and flashback value would be the reasons to watch it. Also released under the title ""Killing Blue.""PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs. sexual situations, nudity"
4,"great thoughts, verses and prayers but...","NOT A JOURNAL! Had hope to record my journey of my pregnancy but this book's only questions was where was I in my life when I found out I was pregnant a ""mom's profile"". Nothing about doctor visits, cravings, thoughts and prayers for this little one I'm carrying. I like the verses and thoughts and guidance for prayer for this tiny one. Just wish it had space for the journaling. Instead of the last section of the book with date____ # of weeks pregnant ______ and blank space. Not sure if the return postage is worth the return."
2,Disappointing Collection,"Based on the title and some reviews, I was expecting this book to be something that inspired me through my pregnancy journey. But the collection of thoughts, prayers and poems were not at all linear. Perhaps it was ""too cute"" and lofty for my taste. If you want something substantive, I suggest you seek another read."
4,A recipe for good instrumental prog.,"This album features Glenn Snelwar who did guitar work with Gordian Knot and Mark Zonder who was the drummer for Fates Warning. How would I describe it? Take 1 cup of Gordian Knot, 1/4 cup mellow Dream Theater, 2 tablespoons of Fates Warning, 1 teaspoon of Spiral Architect, and blend with Mark Zonder's ""Pleasant Shade of Grey"" drumming. What do you get. A really cool instrumental prog. rock album."
3,Nothing spectacular,"Installation was simple and straight forward. No performance gain at all. No loss either. I say it's just a pretty yellow factory replacement. One down side though, the metal that is exposed rusts fast unlike the factory coil which is encased in plastic. Save your money unless you just happen to need a new coil."
3,"Good paper, but tears out too easily with mobile use.","I walk around often with this, and every so often the top page tears away and I have to completely remove it and toss. This process repeats often. So, if you plan on using it heavily on the go, I'd try another product. Nice paper and grids though."
4,Nice and Crisp,"The paper is stiff and takes the ink from technical pens well.This helps me write and draw on this paper without worrying about smears.If you write with either hand, having a top-ruled notebook is a nice advantage."
5,"I'm satisfied with this product, which I use to chart some data for personal review. The sheets are thin, though, ...","I'm satisfied with this product, which I use to chart some data for personal review. The sheets are thin, though, so I'm not sure if it'll meet the standard for professional use."
3,Just Too Tragic,"This is not a review, as many have said all that there needs to be said.I'll just say that I would have liked this movie more if it wasn't so tragic at the end. Tragedy has its place, but I found this overly depressing. Riley's and Marty's friendship didn't have to end irretrievably the way it did. Amends could have been made. I know because I am living it!"
1,Disappointing film.,"I wanted to like this film. The production itself was well done. Quality cinematography and lighting. The Direction was good. The actors themselves were interesting.This film could have been a inspirational underdog story about two men whose hopes are to make it in the difficult world of boxing. Unfortunately That is not where the film takes us.The film begins with the two main characters forming a bond and creating a sense of family in pursuit of their mutual dream. When the coach takes his young protege to his private mountain cabin he makes a failed attempt to seduce him. as a result their bond of trust is broken. They each go their separate ways. Then for some illogical reason the film has the boxer begging the molester to take him back, at the risk of losing a million dollar contract from a Cable network. I would recommend avoiding this movie. It was disappointing and disturbing to watch."
5,Absolutely life changing,I was caught up from the first page. The information in this book has transformed my life and my relationship with my loved one with Alzheimer's. It has made my life so much easier. The book is simply written and easy to understand.
2,OK...,"I don't particularly love it content wise, and the physical book was a let down. Poorly printed, hard to read text bc font choices, background colors/effects, etc. Didn't work for me. Sorry"
2,Nothing interesting except ....,"The acoustic section of ""The last human getaway"" is great, but that's all ! I like this band a lot (see my reviews) for what they have done since the ""Ever"" album in 1994. But this collection of rarities is really for die hard fans, you get some cuts with an horrible sound (worst than a demo) and others sounds just great. It is not an happy listening experience and the album suffer from this. I'll give it to a friend !"
5,Fantastic,"Low expands a little on the basic formula, adding a lot of hooks to some great pop tunes. About half the songs are essential listening. The other half are merely vintage Low."
4,waffle maker,"It is a good waffle maker. The only complaint is if the batter seeps out some, it is not easy to clean. It gets into the spring for the lid and you can't get to it very well."
1,Horrid,Just horrid -- thought I could get of cheap and this happened to be the only waffle maker at WalMart -- on sale for <$10 -- and I got what I paid for. I returned it the next day and am looking for something better...
2,"Disappointing, would not recommend","Hello! We got this waffle maker as a gift for my mother on her birthday. Unfortunately, it didn't work well and we decided to throw it out after two attempts and get her another one. The waffles don't bake well, the settings don't tell you when the waffle is done, and it leaks batter unnecessarily all over the counter! My husband and I make waffles at home on our waffle maker every week and know how to make a good waffle, but this iron doesn't perform."
4,Excellent Book on the Basics,"This book is great for someone who has a little background in physics and calculus. It gives a good breakdown of how the probe works and what kinds of analyses it works best for. This is not an in-depth book on quatitative analyses, but rather, an excellent place to start!"
1,G-ZUS!,"Are *ALL* These Nina DVD's almost identical copies???!!I liked the cover... looks very nice although it appears photoshopped... Cannot honestly find much more to be enjoyed or learned from this 2 hour session of nauseating intercourse between a 50-55 year old Nina Hartley and some much younger plain jane woman thabkfully without deep wrinkles, engaging in a highly unappealing lesbian encounter. The rest, is mainly yadda-yadda-yadda, with more talk still, and a session with a much younger man that does'nt teach anything that you don't already know from common sense, with a few clinical details about clitoral and birth canal sensitivity, and that is really pretty much it. Nothing you could'nt find good info about on the net for FREE. So if you like Nina Hartley, here's your opportunity for 2 grueling hours of a very boring lecture... truly mostly all talk, and highly unattractive and obviously unpleasant ""routine sex"" demonstration, then this is *definitely* for you..."
5,Another Early Essential,"Even though you have probably heard most of these obviously essential RnB songs, cut by the Queen in her prime, you need to get this re-released version if only for one thing: the unedited version of Chain of Fools. The opening, which was trimmed for the version that made it on to the original album and single, is PURE UNADULTERATED SOUL. There is literally nothing like this minute or so of pure anguish turned into vocal sound. This IS soul. And this is Lady Soul. For fans who have the original, YES it is worth buying again. And for the curious, there is hardly a better place to begin."
5,Aretha's BEST album!........,"You'll find a whole slew of her biggest hits in this set (""Chain Of Fools"", ""Natural Woman"", ""Since You've Been Gone""), as well as some alternate versions of them not found on the original release, but one of the best tracks on the album is Aretha's cover of the Rascals' hit ""Groovin'"". While I'm not big on cover songs, this one is SUPERIOR. Aretha sings it to perfection!"
5,A must have CD,"The unedited version of ""Chain of Fools"" with the haunting blues opening makes this CD worth buying by itself. But wait, there's more. The hits fit well together with the lesser known songs; this CD may end up in my top ten of all time (I may have to drop a Beatles album because of it)."
5,What an Amazing Voice,"This is a stunning album. Aretha has one of those voices that is able to make you feel whatever it is she is singing about. It's no wonder she is considered the Queen. She puts other divas to shame with her great voice. ""Natural Woman"" and ""Chain of Fools"" are probably my favorites, but every song is just so good on this album. I highly recommend it."
3,Soul,"I don't care for all of Aretha's songs, but like Gold, Silver, Brass and Bronze the unedited version of Chain of Fools never goes out of style, and never gets old."
4,Hmmm...,"Quoting a previous review: ""It is an absolute waste of money to buy this CD"" - yea, you get a sampling of the best of Seattle's mainstream and underground musical/spoken-word acts, and worst of all...the proceeds go to the Home Alive fund which works to promote safety through self-defense and find the rapist and murderer of Gits frontwoman Mia Zapata. What a waste indeed. A good cause, some good bands. The music is interupted for spoken word interludes by the likes of Jello Biafra and Exene Cervenka. Hardly stand-up comedy, but probably confusing to some mainstream rock kid just looking for rare Nirvana or Pearl Jam."
5,Confusion,"this is an awesom cd...the presidents, TCHKUNG!,soundgarden, pearl jam, nirvana, jello biafra. buy this...you will not be dissapointed"
1,Very Disapointing!,"This CD has all good names on it. However, besides the Nirvana's and Pearl Jam's and Soundgarden's and whatnot, this CD is horrible. It is filled with foolish talk and stand up comic routines. It is a 2 CD set and you have to search for the good stuff. It is NOT worth the money to buy this CD for the ""good stuff""...The Album is screwed up. Go buy a real album like Incesticide (Nirvana) or Superunknown (Soundgarden). It is an absolute waste of money to buy this CD. If you could get it for $3.00 it may be worth it, but, stay clear of this toxic crap!!"
3,"Stannley Torpedo Level 8""","This level works good. I had ordered a gray one as shown in the picture, but got a bright hot orange colored one. I told the company I didn't like the color but they never answered at all. The level does what I needed it to do, it is just the color I don't like."
1,the worst movie since mullholland drive,"this movie would be a waste of anyone's money.even if you bought it for a dollar on ebay.its only 85 minutes,but its the longest 85 minutes of your life when viewing this poor production.i strongly urge not to be an idiot like myself and purchase this and not be able to return it."
1,The dumbest movie I have ever watched,"Do not watch this Movie, what a waste of time, If you want to be scared then this will not do it..I dont have a clue why the other reviews were so into this B less than that rated garbage movie,,,slow movie all the way through, like watching ice melt, wait now that I think about it I wish I would of watched ice melt instead...The acting in this was the worst ive seen in a movie...the sheriff was the worst of them all when it comes to acting,,,,LOL do yourself a favor, if you want to see something scary think of bad thoughts before you go to bed and have a bad dream,,,This movie sucked hard from start to finish and if your thinking about watching it look away friend look away DO NOT WATCH,,,,DUMB DUMB DUMP BOOOO!!! LOL WASTE OF TIME, AND VERY LAME"
3,Average,"Fast delivery.,, I got this chain for my vintage cruiser and it was nice,. I had to cut some links off duh, but after all strong chain."
1,I highly advise spending your money on another chain.,"This product isn't high quality. Although its cheap, you get what you pay for. This chain can bust into pieces pretty easily. I had this on my trek 930 for about a week. While riding though my neighborhood I changed gears. One of the chain links busted open and jammed in my drivetrain, gouging out chunks of paint. I'd expect this to happen maybe while mountain biking a real trail, but on a paved road?! That has to be a really substandard chain for that to happen. I suggest you avoid buying bike parts anywhere that is not a bike shop. For like 5 more dollars you can get a much much stronger chain at a bike shop. Don't be cheap when it comes to parts that are vital for a bicycle to move. You'll regret it when you are stranded miles away from your destination with busted bike parts."
1,This chain is completely worthless on a bicycle. Maybe it could be used for some other purpose.,"I don't give a 1 star review lightly. I bought this chain at Walmart. As soon as I put it on my bicycle it was making crazy rubbing sounds. I adjusted my derailleur and it still was making crazy noises and jumping back and forth between sprockets. I brought it in to the bike shop and they adjusted it and it still would skip teeth when coming up hills. Replaced it with an SRAM chain and everything is perfect again. I can't believe this product is even on the market, it's worthless."
4,Highly recommended,"L.Jones is the engrossing story of a feminist art historian (though A.Lurie certainly doesn't seem to be a feminist herself) who immerges herself in the life of a recently-deceased fairly unknown painter, in order to write her biography. Her research takes her on a journey of unexpected discoveries, both about Lorin Jones and about herself. A. Lurie's writing style may be deliberately ""simple"", but her book is very rich and captivating: I highly recommend it."
3,Romantic Comedy,"Alison Lurie is a great storyteller, and here she has a thought-provoking and interesting theme: the temptations of a biographer to identify too closely with her subject. Polly Alter, the biographer, is alternately drawn to excuse the woman artist, Lorin (alternatively Laura, Lolly, Laurie) Jones, even to glorify her -- or to blame her as a devouring and selfish narcissist. Just as Lorin has many names, so she also has many identities, and the ""true"" one remains elusive.Beneath this complexity, however, lies some simplicity, even stereotyping -- especially of New York City feminist/lesbian culture. Yes, it's funny, but sometimes in a cheap-shot sort of way.Still, because the humor is self-deprecating, it is finally forgiveable even if a blemish on the novel. This remains a very pleasureable book to read and a romance, in many senses."
3,"two plot line, one well done.","There are two interweaving plot lines to this novel: the gradual uncovering of the truth about Lorin Jones, and the personal life of the investigator, Polly Alter. The former is fun and fascinating, and the characters met along the way (except for the last) are well drawn. The latter is heavy handed, and not up to Lurie's usual level of writing. Also, Polly's failed marriage is nicely summed up by her (p.118): ""Both of us were fools, trusting people to whom in the end we didn't mean all that much"". Yet, that statement notwithstanding, the failure is cast entirely in feminist terms.The most moving part of the novel is the letter from Lorin Jones' childhood friend who recognizes the title of one of Lorin's paintings. This brings back all sorts of positive memories, but then the friend learns that Lorin Jones is dead."
4,100 Women Who Shaped World History,"I think this is an excellent book for girls to read because it shows them that there are women who changed or help change world history.The author tells about the troubles the women went though and what they accomplished. This book does not just talk about queens and princesses, but also includes less privileged women who made important changes. It goes all the way back to Queen Makare Hatshepsut in 1530 BC and ends with Rigoberta Menchu. This book includes a trivia quiz and maps to show you where the women lived/live. Overall, I believe this is an excellent book because many of these women have been left out of school history books."
3,Insider,The story is another conspiracy thing and you can see the bad guy 1/3 of the way in. You stay because the author has been there and shares his insider knowledge with you. Always interesting.
5,A great singer,"This cd from Heino is just one of the many great CDsfrom Heino over the many years. Heino is really a greatsinger plus his wife joins him in some of the CDs, really makes great music, plus since my wife is fromGermany its even better. Its great that we can get all of the German music through amazon.com."
3,If details are wrong...,"Most of the way through the book; it's a good read, and interesting. On the other hand, the author four or five times has referred to how the Greeks, or sometimes the Athenians, did not grow enough food, so they imported corn from Egypt, the Black Sea area, etc.Mr. Robinson, corn is indigenous to the Americas and did not make it to Europe until the 16th century. If you are wrong in a basic detail like that, how much can I trust the other details and ""facts"" in the book?"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I bought this monitor partially based on its reviews. Well, my experience was not has happy as the rest.- It is the second day of use, and it already have dead pixels.- If I want to change the resolution then I have to spend a lot of time trying to adjust it.- I like very small icons so I set my resolution at 1280x1024 pixels, and it does not look right at all.The only good thing was the price. I had an Acer before and it was a better experience."
4,Great product. Terrible buying experience,"I ordered this monitor in early April. I kept getting messages from Amazon that it was delayed. A month passed and I got another message from Amazon. I went to their website and it said the product was shipping immediately. But, mine was still delayed. I decided to order it again, and cancel the original order. It was shipped immediately! When I got it, though, it was shipped in an open box that looked like it had been dropped from a second story window. I notified Amazon and they sent another, right away. The monitor is great, but the buying experience sucked."
5,Wow,"Small box, great screen. color is great. I'm not an avid gamer so I am not sure how the response time would be. I know Tiger Wood PGA 2006 plays great.Under $200? How can you beat that with a name brand?"
2,Not what I expected.,This book is definitely not what I expected. I didn't realize that this was a miniture book that was more or less on a kids level.
2,Quality of recording quite poor,"Good selection of music but the production quality is really bad. Like sitting in a small, tinny bar with maybe 20-30 patrons. This album is really only for people who have to own every single thing VU did. Otherwise, go for the 1969 live album (recorded in Texas)."
5,Essential Velvets,"Here's another live set that I preferred over the popular favorite. The Live 69 set always seemed muddy and unlively to me. The Max's set, while lo-fi, finds the band in a much more relaxed setting and in fine form.The lo-fi aspect of these recordings has been overstated, in my opinion. Those who purchased the Bootleg Series set will find this to be on par or better in terms of fidelity. The overall ambiance allows one to close the eyes and be right in the club.The two sets recorded this night (the last night Reed was with the band?) show the Velvets as a tight rock n roll band. I think the ballads are some of Lou Reeds finest recorded vocals.Velvets fans should buy this just because of the extra songs. The curious should check it out as a fine historical document. This was rock n roll."
4,"""We Don't Do Heroin""","This was one of the first VU albums I heard as a kid. A classmate (who I was in a garage band with) had it and we damn near wore out the grooves. It inspired us to get a different bass player and do most of the songs on that record. It sounded great until my buddy's mom said we couldn't play with him 'cause she didn't like his look.I just recently got this record on CD and had forgotten how great it is. Yeah, the sound quality blows. But, keep in mind, it IS the Velevet Underground. Playing's great. Energy's fantastic. Lou's singing is top notch. And best of all, a fan yells out a request for ""Heroin"". Lou flatly responds, ""We don't do Heroin"". You can't write that kinda stuff."
2,Stop! Don't buy it on CD!,"You are absolutely throwing your money away if you buy this curious legitimate bootleg album on CD. It's an interesting listen, and it'll make you cry because nobody thought to capture the legendary (albeit knocking on death's door) Velvets run at Max's in 1970 on decent recording equipment. But seek it out on used vinyl or cassette, and be prepared to play with your tone controls and equalizer to make it listenable. Docked two stars for audio quality..."
2,Poorly recorded and inferior version of the Velvets.,"Oh dear. Not only is the recording terrible but drummer Billy Yule, who replaces Moe Tucker due to her pregnancy, is beyond awful. His wildly inappropriate drumming makes the Velvets sound almost like an average garage band. Combine Billy's bad rhythms with the atrocious sound quality and Live At Max's Kansas City becomes an imperfect poop storm. This is not The Velvet Underground, at least not any version I want to listen to. Though the Velvets were criminally under recorded, and I know fans want to get everything, I'd skip this release and get the amazing Velvet Undergound Live instead or The Quine Tapes. This one's strictly for historical curiosities' sake, and doesn't warrant repeated listens."
3,poor sound quality mars very good performance,"this recording was made by a friend of lou's with a small, reporters type of sony cassette recorder. the sound is clear but tinny mono. there is no or very little bottom to the sound. that said, the performance of the band is excellent and the recording is of historical significance as the velvet underground's last gig."
2,for completists only,"Considering the absolutely horrible audio quality, the fact that Moe Tucker isn't drumming on it, and that none of the versions found here come close to equalling other versions available-- I'd say this one is only for those that have bought everything else under their name and still want/need more. It is almost unlistenable due to it being an audience tape recording and I almost never put it on."
3,"Suffers from the absence of Moe Tucker, but contains the greatest version of 'New Age' ever.","God, listen to those introductory chords...the almost hymn-like chant of ""It's the beginning of a new age""...the solo. The majesty of The Velvet Underground's music is evident even on an audience recording like this. (Yes, the quality of the recording is relatively poor when everything else you listen to is digital and razor-sharp, but I've heard worse. Much worse, actually.) Both versions of 'Sweet Jane' retain the beautiful introduction found on the studio recording, which is another plus. 'Who Loves the Sun' is unfortunately incomplete.You should know by now whether or not you're going to like this album. It's not a suitable introduction if you're new to the Velvets, but it's great if you've heard the studio albums a million times and are curious about what the band sounded like during its summer 1970 residence at Max's."
4,Technical Difficulties,"Mostly well-staged and well-acted version of Marlowe's Edward II sometimes hampered by technical limitations of 1969 studio recordings: color variations and ghosting not too bad, but unfortunately the sound boom operator often misses covering the actors--the variable sound quality isn't ""drop out""--just the guy holding the pole not moving fast enough.For some reason the ""Three poor men"" sequence with Gaveston is trimmed in the beginning (you'll note the bad cut a few minutes in)--yet the actors names appear in the credits.A strange ""Marlowe Coroner's Inquest"" narrated by Patrick Stewart is an extra.Performances mostly 5 & Technical aspects mostly 3 = 4 overall"
2,Edward II,"Boring, not because of the story, but too theatrical or to say it in a different way is that the actors seem 'phony'."
5,Working from Home,This book gives reader's the pro's and con's of working from home in the desktop publishing industry. There are step-by-step calculations to help you figure out daily costs and what to charge for your work. It gives an overview of the different types of computer software that you will need to use. There is helpful advice on dealing with suppliers and finding the right printshop. My friend bought me this book for my birthday and it is one of the most useful presents I have ever received!
2,"Slow, ploding and sad","These were a bit of a disappointment. The costumes and scenery are great, but the stories are so sad. I yearned for a happy ending. I guess there weren't any in those days."
2,Missing the most historic episode :-(,"I'd been waiting years to find this series because I wanted one historic episode starring Peter Firth: THE SIMPLE LIFE - one of the very first gay-themed ""romances"" shown on national TV. I was truly let down to find that this 2 disc set did not contain that episode (even though it does contain another episode with Peter Firth).When I ordered it, I saw Firth listed as one of the stars so I had no idea the set lacked the only episode I actually wanted. I hope this missing episode will be forthcoming at some point"
2,Jeremy Brett episode MISSING from this collection,"I had seen this collection included in several lists of Jeremy Brett's TV films (including Amazon's). I ordered it only to find that Brett's episode, ""An Aspidistra in Babylon,"" was not included. Beware! Only eight of the original 13 episodes are in this set. My request for a refund was accepted, but I note the collection is still listed on Amazon under Jeremy Brett's films."
1,Awful,Don't waste your money on this one. I've never been so disappointed with a BBC drama. You watch these vignettes and end up scratching your head wondering what the point of the story was. These stories are half baked and NOT heartwarming as described in the product information. These shows are a far cry from the high standard I have come to expect from BBC period drama.
5,Flowtech Purple Hornies 3-Hole Header Mufflers,Mufflers are awesome. They create a deep rumble. For their short length they offer excellent tone value that is not too loud and gives the car that thunder sound.
4,"The Perfect Ball of Bands, for Short-Term Banding only","The rubber band ball is the perfect size for my daily needs at work. I predict the ball will last atleast a year. The bands are all about the same width and length. They are about six inches in circumference, stretching to over twelve inches. They are not thin and dry like some of the bands I bought in the past; I don't believe these bands will break easily. They also come in five colors, which is great for bundles requiring color-coding.Edit to review: After using the rubber bands for 9 months, the bands keep snapping and breaking on my fingers. OUCH! And many of the bundles of receipts I banded have broken apart. This is probably normal for rubber bands. So I think this big ball of bands is only good for someone who plans to use them all within 6 months. And they are only to be used for short-term storage. Do not bundle records or other items that will be in storage for long-term."
5,Nice,"This is a small rubberband ball, but for the price it is fine. The bands are not old crumbly ones either, so makes it a decent value. I bought it as a joke for a friend that needed rubberbands and she got a kick out of it."
5,"Witty, Irreverent and Serious","This witty autobiography makes for an amusing read. Comedian Lenny Bruce (1925-1966) was irreverent, funny, creative and daring - loved by many, but feared by others. In this revealing book he describes his upbringing, his struggles as a rising comic, and his near-obsessive love for his wife Honey. There's also an amusing yet serious look at his legal troubles on charges of obscenity - Bruce dared to use dirty words in front of audiences that paid to hear him. By today's standards Bruce probably wouldn't raise many eyebrows, but in the early 1960's he was highly controversial. Sadly, Bruce was also a troubled by depression and drug abuse. This book is an amusing and revealing look at a comic rebel."
3,Charlie Chan,"Nice movies with small errors in dvd ,freezing up for a sec on all dvd being watched,but charlie chan moviers are 70 years old and quality of DvD picture very very good 4 starsCharlie Chan Collection, Vol. 5 (Charlie Chan At The Wax Museum/Murder Over New York/Dead Men Tell/Charlie Chan In Rio/Charlie Chan In Panama/Murder Cruise/Castle in the Desert)"
3,What About Roland Winters???,"Although I was looking forward to set 5 of the Chan movies, I was disappointed in the double discs. Also, what about the last 5 Chan movies Toler made? (Red dragon,Dark Alibi, Shadows Over Chinatown, Dangerous Money, The Trap. These are not in the Chanthology either.) So in my opinion, there should be a volumne 6 with these.Now.....what about the Chans with Roland Winters?? There are 6 of those movies: The Chinese Ring, Docks of New Orleans, Shanghai Chest, The Golden Eye, The Feathered Serpent, Sky Dragon. These would comprise volumne 7. So the Chan movies are NOT complete. Roland Winters made an interesting Chan as well and should not be ignored.Does anyone else out there know of anything about these mentioned movies and about any plans for Roland Winters???? Somebody seems to have dropped the ball on the Chans."
3,Looks different when we have it with us,"The whole collection is ok.But i must complain because you send me Vols.4 and 5 twice in B&W when on the site the information on the Format is that those dvd's are color.Ithink that the information on the site is wrong.Pse be so kind and correct it.Apart of it I would like to sudgest that the dvd's that you sell come with Portuguese or Spanish legends,because there a lot of them that I don't buy because do not have legends in PT or SP.I might understand that this is difficult for you, pse at least give a ""BIG"" try.All the best for you all.Abel Costa"
1,Where are the 8 discs?,"The movies are great: FIVE STARS for Charlie Chan...ONE STAR for 20th Century Fox. Very disapointed in Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 5; what a let down! Only 4 disc's (3 despised ""double sided"" and 1 single sided - Castle in the Desert). The other 4 sets were superb and I was expecting more of the same to complete my collection."
5,Best of the CHARLIE CHAN DVD collections,"This is the best of the 5 CHARLIE CHAN DVD collections. 6 of the 7 films rate among my favorites. There is an excellent short, ""ERA OF CHAN"". I also enjoyed the stills gallerys. Excellent quality reproduction of the films."
5,Wow! What a set! 5+++,"This set is packed with wonderful films for the Chan lover. Wax Museum is probably the best of the Toler films, with Castle in the Desert a close second. Both films have the mysterious atmosphere which made me a life-long fan of the genre. Murder over New York is a favorite of mine. Watch closely and you'll spot one of the Stooges in a bit part. This film has two of the best unintentionally funny scenes in the whole series. Dead Men Tell was my favorite film as a child - the ghost walks to creepy music. And Rio is notable for the terrific cast of actors - Marybeth Hughes as the tipsy jealous wife is my favorite here. These restored sets have come with crisp quality pictures and sound and I assume this one will be the same. If you want to turn someone into a Chan fan, this is certainly the set to start with. I can't wait to get my set."
3,Falling Quality,"Compared with the first 4 Fox CC sets, this one has three sound ""CC in Somewhere"" formats and 4 extra-low budget quickies. Still, if you have gotten through the first 4 Fox sets, you may want to finish the Fox CC holdings. (TCM has out a 4-CC set also).Actually, the CC in the Wax Museum has some very interesting plot twists that could have made a really good movie in the hands of a competent director. Also, if the director of CC in Rio had stopped to check on Brazilian Law related to crimes of passion and blackmail at the time of the movie, the ending would have far better for the viewer, i.e., the doers of the deed would have gone free. Hmm, I guess I've just made a case for buying this."
4,Charlie Chan moves up,"These are good Sidney Toler Charlie Chan movies worth seeing by any Charlie Chan fan. These are good mysteries. In addition, excellent action and good acting are evident in this volume."
5,Charlie is Chantastic!,"This Charlie Chan set is great. The packaging is great and the movies are great. No problems. Charlie Chan has been around since the 1930's, so I won't bore you with the story lines. I'm sure you know them as well as I do. The movies have been remastered and I can't wait to see them in Hi Def, as soon as I go hi-def, that is. So, what more can I say? I loved Charlie Chan as a kid and now I own every Chan movie known to man, I think! I watch them often and never get bored with him."
5,Charlie Chan Volume 5,"I bought this set on a pre-release sale. Product was exactly as advertised, arrived on time, and is great.Some of the films have a notice that they were made with the best surviving media available but the movies are crisp and clear.For the Chan enthusiast, it is a must have."
3,Close-but no cigar!,"IMHO these films that make up ""Charlie Chan- Vol. #5"" are good enough to watch if you have an hour or so to kill. They are all in black and white,have been restored masterfully,and with Sidney Toler,very presentable. They run 60 to 75 minutes each and look as though they have been filmed in one or two rooms!Now that I have given my blunt but ,I feel,honest personal opinion,I state that if you are a Charlie chan afficianato as I am, you will enjoy them. I give them 3 1/2 stars.But I myself am critical since I have all the Volumes from 1-5. As for mystery and content you will be hard pressed to get 6 episodes in one volume for this price! Good luck! You can't go wrong ,unless, you are more of a critic than I am!"
5,Charlie Chan,"Very good package of Chan series. The digitizing is great, clear and sharp detail. Well worth the buy for Chan followers."
4,charlie chan volume 5,"all of the movies in charlie chan vol. 5 are great! I loved cc as a kid and still love the old movies now, more than ever! am looking forward to purchasing more, thanx to the great prices at Amazon.com!"
3,SAY HELLO TO ST. BETTE,"I recently saw this movie on TCM. Let me tell you, If you are a fan of the great Bette Davis as I am this is one worth owning or at least seeing. So,you may be asking why I only gave it three stars? Here is why,as far as the story line and acting go, the movie is not one of Bette's greatest. The real jem of this movie is the character that Bette plays. I could not get over this ""kinder and more gentle"" Bette. Get a load of this: After losing the man that she loves,(a very young and handsome) Henry Fonda to another woman she not only does not fight to get him back in classic Bette Davis style, she hands over her young son(a child from her short lived marriage to Fonda) so that he and his new wife can raise him!!! Now, if that does not have you stunded this will. In a sceen in the movie, Bette is asked if she would like a cigarette and I KID YOU NOT, she turns it DOWN!!!You just have to see this movie to believe it!It really is a Hoot!"
3,how to do some things with JavaScript,"The book supposes that readers don't know anything about HTML and JavaScript so it introduces HTML and JavaScript at the same time. Also, it covers most JavaScript features and gives you some simple examples. If you are new to HTML and JavaScript, this is the right book for you. You can know the basics of JavaScriptvery quickly.Since this book only introdcues ""how to do some things with JavaScript"". And if you really want to know ""how to do everything with JavaScript"", "" JavaScript & DHTML Cookbook"" might be the book you should buy."
2,nieces wanted this,Our nieces wanted these Bratz dolls (and it was grudgingly OK'd by their mother)...far from my choice of toy but the kid liked it...whatever.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because it is recommended by the Feminist Press, but I was very disappointed. The language is stilting, and the translation is boring. Maybe it was more interesting in the original language. If you are interested in multicultural feminist stories, you are better off buying the amazing collection by Kathleen Ragan, ""Fearless Girls, Wise Women, and Beloved Sisters: Heroines in Folktales from Around the World."" Ragan's book alone will likely get us through the folk and fairy tale age without having to resort to Grimm's."
4,Good Remastered Collection at a Great Price,"For all of you out there in music land that are looking at this ""Rhino Flashback"" and wondering if this is simply an old inferior re-issue, rejoice! This very reasonably priced CD (around $5) sounds just as good, with identical output levels as other advertised ""re-mastered"" versions of Bad Company, which usually sell for more than twice this price. My copy says right on the back ""Digitally Remastered from the Original Master Tapes by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound"". The disc also has the big ""Flying Swan Song Guy"" screenprinted across the disc just like all the other regular modern remasters that I have purchased.So, if you have held off buying this particular disc because you felt like it just had one good song on it (Burnin' Sky), and you didn't want to pay full price for one song (nobody does), don't hesitate to pick this one up soon. You won't be disappointed. There are some really decent songs on here that I am hearing for the first time."
5,Great Album,"Bad Company is one of my favorite all time bands. Love this album , great add to my CD collection"
3,oops,"Here's where they got real formulaic.The title track is the only real standout and since it is not available on 10 From 6 I had to get it.Sorry, but this one is strictly for the dedicated fan."
2,Pretty Weak,Burning Sky (the song) cannot carry Burning Sky (the album). Just too much weak material here. Buy it if you have to but you'd be better off just spending 99 cents on the title track and pretending it was on Running with the Pack or one of their earlier great albums.
2,A little off,"When you turn it one direction vs the other, it does not agree with itself, which means it's off by a bit."
3,"A little off, but not bad","I got this level for a patio I installed. It does not give very accurate readings, but I can't complain. The readings were close, but a friend brought a nicer line level over and after doing a few tests we found this Stanley line level was off. The aluminum tabs bend, and change the angle in which it hangs. But it's 3 bucks! In the future I'd buy a nicer product that will last longer and be more accurate."
2,Use a transit if it is important,I used this product while laying out a new deck. I was able to get pretty close but on long spans (my longest is 36') I ended up being off and had a hard time getting it just right. I would recommend a line level for small projects but either spend the money or rent a transit for big jobs that need to be level.
5,Starting a quilting business? read this book!,"This book is an absolute necessity if you are going to become a professional quilter or even think you might want to be one. Thelen takes you through the process: from the very beginning questions you need to ask yourself, to providing you with charts and numerous 'worksheets' to figure your timing, planning and managing clients. She walks you though figuring out how much to charge, how much time you spend, how to market your services, what services to provide and even what office supplies you should probably have. She goes through the difference in stippling, custom quilting, and patterned meandering, charging by the hour or by the size. She goes through it all. This is not a pattern book though. Look elsewhere for patterns, look here for good solid information. Worth a purchase for the reader interested in starting a business."
5,A Textbook for the Machine Quilting Businss,This book is a MUST READ for anyone considering running a Quilting Business! Straight forward advise and guidance.
3,New book has interesting thesis but needs an editor,"I liked this book in general and found the arguments interesting. I have read Kennedy's speeches and have generally agreed with the author's theories. The book is also a fast read and reasonably well written/organized.However there are a couple of problems with the book. First,as was said, it needs a good editor. There are a couple of repetitions which are not needed in a book of this length. Second, how many times can one use the word Stimsonian in one sentence? 10 or 20? Maybe the author should have developed a synonym for the word. Finally, often the author makes an argument without quoting from Kennedy. Unsubstantiated arguments become just one guys opinion and not a great theory to work form.Still, a good book and an interesting thesis."
1,A Failed and Suspect Book,"Beran's writing style is cloyingly pedantic. Reading this book, I became convinced that the author's real focus was himself--to demonstrate how learned he is, how clever he is. Further, his compulsion to belittle others (Jack Newfield, Franklin Roosevelt, many others) is too frequent and, at times, too intense to ignore. Finally, he does not make a good case for his premise: that Robert Kennedy was not who we thought he was and that only the author has been smart enough to discern Mr. Kennedy's real self."
3,Not for everyone,"This is a book best suited for academic types. It is more about the author's description of the ""end of the American aristocracy"" than it is about Bobby Kennedy. The writing feels overblown, using five dollar words when fifty cent words would have sufficed. And as other reveiwers here have noted, the use of the word ""Stimsonian"" over and over, without adequetely describing what a ""Stimsonian"" is(or was, or might be)got pretty annoying by the end of the book. Still, if ones interest in the Kennedy's is deep enough, the book does provide yet another take on the mystique surrounding one of America's most loved-and despised-families."
3,AANKHEN ROCKS !,AANKHEN ROCK !. VERY GOOD STORY LINE AND TOTALY BLANCED FROM THE TO THE END. A TOTAL ENTERTAINER ROCKING.PERFORMENCE WIFEAMITHABH AS ALWAYS EXCELENT.PRAESH RAWAL STANDS OUT.AKSHAY KUMAR IS GOOD.SUSHMITA SEN IS VERY GOOD.ARJUN RAMPAL IS GOOD TOO.A MUST BUY FILM1 AANKHEN.
5,backpack,"Excellent- bigger than all other backpacks I used- good zippers, stable, and excellent value for the money. Very pleased! Comfortable."
2,You get what you pay for,"Although the pack looks great at first, after actually using it on vacation, I would definitely recommend paying the extra $25-50 and getting a good durable pack from a known brand.The clips that hold the lid down are made of obviously low-quality thin plastic that simply aren't going to hold up to any remotely demanding use.I used this pack once, taking it on a 2 week trip in Europe, and by the time I got back 2 out of the 3 connectors on the front of it were broken to the point that they're no longer functional. Since the lid doesn't snap down all the way anymore, the bag is no longer worth using and I already had to replace it.I've had a smaller Vaude bag for about 10 years that's been on many vacations (as a checked bag a few times) and camping trips, and its still going strong with absolutely no problems. This Harvest bag was horrible.I would have given it one star, however I did make it back from Europe with everything still inside of it."
4,I never received this book,"This book never made it to me. I received the other book in my order, but not this one. I like the book. I have seen it before, but I am most curious where it is. Thank you."
5,Katybug99,"I received this book about 30 years ago as a gift. I am so glad that they have reprinted it. I am buying a copy to give as a birthday gift to my niece and 1 for my kids.(My mother will not relinquish the original one to me even though it is mine.) It is such a sweet book. I can remember poring over the pictures and just imagining the little bears in each of their trees. Theodore was always my favorite. I hope my kids and niece enjoy this book as much as I did. What fond memories. If you buy any book, buy this one. They do not make them like this anymore."
5,My 3 year old daughter's favorite book (for the past year),"This is an outstanding book for little girls. The illustrations are beautiful and my daughter has spent hours going through each and every page and picking out each and every one of the fourteen bears...""there is Emma,"" ""there is little Theodore.""I would recommend this book to any parent with a young daughter who enjoys looking at books!"
2,Impressive technically- artistically trash,"I love many Russian films, but not this one. Trash in the guise of art. It is technically remarkable, being filmed in one shot. The message, however, is conceited and extremely nationalistic. There are people of culture in every country, and they are united by their sense of culture. This film implies that Russians are more cultured than everyone else, and in doing so destroys a fascinating premise and denegrates the ""art"". Could have been great, but came off as banal. Pass."
2,Some parts work others do not,The positive reviews of this DVD motivated my ordering it. I was not able to see this DVD completely only some fragments. The image was not stable and some times stopped completely. Regetfully I returned it.
1,Snore,"Don't waste your time on this snoozer. So it was all filmed in one take. Whoop-de-doo. It has no story, no interesting characters, nothing to keep your attention. I saw it at the cinema upon its initial release and I was bored stiff. It has approximately zero redeeming qualities."
3,Great Classic one shot,Very classic attempt to show the inside of a Great Place in one contius camera shot..Pulled very well.This a classic
5,Wonderful Film,"There are many great things about this film, you can read all about them in other reviews if you want the details. Just think what you want to get out of a film: A visual landscape that takes you to a place you most likely won't see; characters who share their culture with you and emotionally involve you; a visual commentary on one of Russia's most important landmarks. And it only gives you a glimpse of Russia, her remarkable people, her heritage. Present this film along with the documentary on the Hermitage (also on DVD) as the best gift for the Holidays."
1,"If it's not HD, don't bother...","I first saw ""Russian Arc"" on HDNet movies on my Sony monitor, and was spellbound. An amazing feat of cinamatography. I had to own it. But I mistakenly did not check to insure the DVD I was buying was in HD. Watching this movie in anything but HD is not worth your time. The incredibly intricate detail of the costumes, the fantasticly clear works of art in the background, all gone. And camera pans are blurred compared to the HD version. Almost my entire enjoyment of this movie was due to the amazing HD. Without it, this DVD will sit on my shelf, never to be watched again."
4,The One-Shot Clause,"While I more or less enjoyed RUSSIAN ARK, I'm not sure that the fact that it was shot in a single take should be deserving of so much praise. Sure, it's a logistical feat of grand proportions, but even the most candy-coated of Hollywood blockbusters are logistical feats of grand proportions. A one-shot take has no inherent creative merit, unlike, say, an inventive script or genuine thespianship. I won't go as far to say that it's a gimmick - though it's tempting to say as much when it's touted relentlessly in the film's publicity; I just think film-goers should appreciate it for what it is - a film-making technique - and be wary not to settle for less from the other constituents of the film because of it."
2,I Fell Asleep In the Russian Ark,"I have no doubt that through many viewers' eyes, this is a masterpiece. However, this film perturbed and bored me. I forced myself to watch this for 40 minutes (without interruption)and then gave up. There just seemed to be alot of confused and straggling groups of costumed actors wandering around through darkened tunnels and corridors, and an overvoiced character off camera asking where he was. Well, I certainly didn't know - and my metaphor-o-meter was broken for this film. Just not my cup of Russian tea."
2,PRETENTIOUS AND SLOW,"This film is one long, uninterrupted take. It will give you a newfound appreciation for the art of editing, because _Russian Ark_ certainly needed it. I can admire the technical virtuousity and daring required to pull off this film, but the finished product is mostly dull, listless, and affected. This is the sort of movie that gives art-house films a bad name."
3,Museum Piece,"In the commentary of this film, the creators explain that this film should be viewed as a museum piece or a tour. It lives up to what they say in terms of its slow pacing. Some of the compositions in this film are incredible, including when the camera travels down a hallway following a group of Russian princesses. Besides being an entire film created in one continuous shot, an impressive technical feat is the traversal between a warm interior out to the wintry outdoors and back. The lack of a narrative takes away from the film, but it may hold more interest with Russians or those who have studied Russian history."
5,"Much, much, much larger.","The Hermitage collection is much, much, much larger than depicted. That said, this DVD is a thrill and a lesson in classical architecture."
4,Visually Stunning,"-Most of the reviews here tell you what you need to know.I just wanted to share my impression.The film is a visual masterwork. The 90-minute shot notwishstanding, there isn't a thing on the screen that is less opulent or less pleasing to the eye than any other.""Gorgeous"", as a defining term, just doesn't seem to do it justice. The camera work is so fluid, so perfect.However, there isn't much of a story here. Just some loose bones to hang the images on. It was a bit distracting at times, particularly the old man's ""umming"" and ""ahhing"" (which he does quite often).Alot of this is due to the very bad audio dub. Much of the dialog didn't match the actor's lip movements.For some those are insurmountable obstacles to enjoying this movie.If you look at it as a 300-year tour of Russian history, then you will be satisfied.The Hermitage is an incredible place.Many of the images from this film will stay with you for days.-"
2,Good sleeping pill,"Yes I too fell asleep watching this mess of a film even though I am Russian and have visited the Hermitage. There really is no script, the tour of the Hermitage was way too dark. Only redeeming quality was a time travel glimpse of aristocracy in this great palace which is now a museum."
1,Horrible transfer do not buy!!!!!,"This is the first review I have bothered to write and have bought hundreds of products of amazon.com. I didn't listen to other reviews about the blurry quality and found out the hard way that this is $12 for a reason. I wouldn't be surprised to learn it was pirated. In fact, there was some ""Canada only"" stickers on the package. The disc also stalls out on a famously contiguous 90 minute no-cut first-of-a-kind film. Garbage. Especially if you have not yet seen this film, do not watch this version as you will be cheated out of a fantastic cinematic experience."
1,Textbook style movie. Yawn!,"I tried to like this movie, but it was so boring. I don't even think more than a few high-school students, looking for a diversion from the usual classroom materials would find this one interesting. One problem is that the ""guide"" is so obnoxious you want to leave him."
1,"Oh, no thank you","This is one of the most boring and pointless films I have ever seen. It's just a couple of guys having a pissing contest about whether russians or europeans are better at this, that and the other. Apparently it's a technical marvel and other filmmakers find it marvelous yada yada blah blah, but the marvels of making a single-shot film don't substitute for a plot and characters of interest and substance."
1,nice for film students.,"There is always some snob people who feel they have to say experiments are art, just to stay ""avant-garde"". A shame.Guys, this is just a nice film experiment. 15 minutes of it would be ok to enjoy, no more than that."
3,Russian Ark,"A dreamlike passage through time of the wonderful winter palace in St. Petersburg, culminating in a magnificant ball in the nineteenth century where the younger generation danced an exciting mazurka. It showed that energetic and lively dancing is not necessarily a monopoly of the 21st Century. The fading of this opulence was brilliantly portrayed as the crowds in the ballroom slowly descended the grand staircase and gradually disappeared into the mists of history, never again to be awakened. An elegant dreamlike world gone forever."
4,Masterpiece on many levels,"The Hermitage is probably unique as a museum in that it is not only the ""ark"" of a famous collection of works initiated by Catherine the Great, it is also the backdrop to some of the most bloody and tumultuous histories of the world. In this film, the Museum is the central protaganist. All the actors, the French Marquis, the director's voice are just temporary visitors. The Museum is constant, timeless.This film is very beautiful, very evocative and expressive. It is also a great way to see some of the Hermitage. Even if one visits the museum, there is no certainty that the rooms shown in the film can be seen (they may be closed for renovation etc). I loved this film."
3,"If you love movies, studying Russian a must watch. But rent it first.","A highly intricate and technical video essay of Russian history and culture, told through a stream of consciousness narrative. A description more than that would be misleading and would perform a disservice to the movie. I didn't see the ending of the film (the last 15 mins?), by then I didnt care, which is ok. Not everything needs to be finished to be satisfying. Interesting movie though. This is a cinematographer's movie and/or Russian studies type of flick, if your one of them (or a movie lover in need of a a change of pace) a must watch. But rent it first."
5,Great entertainment amongst group enlightenment circles,"I watched this movie with a group of five other peers, who under the influence of alochol and other like thought iducement supplements, were completely astounded by the visual effects in this film."
1,Boring! Boring! Boring!,"From my perspective, Russian Ark is painfully boring. I say this as someone who watches a lot of films that could be similarly characterized as arty or experimental. I only finished watching this film because I was with friends, and it seemed best to just hang in there. When the film was over, we checked a number of websites to see what others thought. My mind was blown by the high percentage of positive (often glowing) reviews by critics and non-critics alike. While the technical skill required to record the entire movie in one shot is impressive, the lack of compelling characters or plot resulted in my desire to stop watching the film shortly after it began."
1,perhaps useful as a technique of torture,"The first time I tried to watch this film, I was five beers and a vicodin deep. I fell asleep and tried again the next day, completely sober. If you find that you must sit through this movie so that you can talk about it at pretentious parties or something, I'd recommend accompanying it with the cocktail I had the first time around. Just be careful to avoid an acetaminophen overdose -- that's about the only thing that might make your night worse."
3,its okay,This soundtrack is okay but i only gave it 3 stars because chamillion wrecks the talking that talk track. He is the best rapper ever and soon the whole world will see it. Chamillionaire the best ever kills his track and makes this cd a good buy.
2,Different from the movie,"Most of these aren't even in the actual movie.And to answer another person's question about that song that goes, ""Boom...here comes the...boom"" - I didn't check it on the DVD, but as I remember from the movie, it's POD's song ""Boom"" from their CD called ""Satellite."""
1,These are not the songs from the movie,"When I saw this movie, I thought this is a soundtrack I got to have. I went out and bought it the next day. It took about 10 minutes for me to realize that I'd made a huge mistake. The soundtrack is not really a ""soundtrack"". I could hardly pick out the songs on the CD as being songs in the movie. I was really looking forward to the diverse mix of rock and hip-hop that was in the movie, but all that the soundtrack has is Nelly, Nelly, Nelly. Where's the other cool songs from the movie? My review is one star because they won't allow less than that!"
1,THIS IS JUST AWFUL!,"Where are the songs that were IN the movie?!? Do not waste your money. The movie has great songs, they are not here."
2,Are you kidding me?,"This soundtrack did not do justice to the music played in the movie. Right after the movie my girlfriend and I said, ""Oh my gosh, we have to get this cd!"" Then I see the songs listed on the cd, and not everything is on there. I was awfully disappointed. There is some good music on this cd, but honestly they should have stretched to the longest yard"
1,inspired music from the movie isn't what i call a soundtrack,"just watched the movie and these songs do not match with the music that was in the movie.so why call it a soundtrack cause it's not.youd think they could release a sound track with songs from the movie, not some music that was inspired by the movie."
1,Not A True Soundtrack,"If you went to the movie and enjoyed the music, just be aware that this CD is not a true soundtrack. Many good songs just aren't on it. I was very disappointed. If you are a big Nelly fan you will probably enjoy this CD, otherwise be warned."
1,What the hell happened to the rock tracks?,"What the hell happened to the rock tracks! I distinctly remember several rock tracks, two ACDC ones even. I go to get the album, they aren't there! What is up with that. As it is, rap sucks, then they slap me in the face by putting only rap on this CD? Un@#$#$@believable. This is one CD I won't be buying."
1,What sound track?,Saw the movie on Friday went looking for the sound track on Saturday. To say it was a joke was an understatement. The movie's got a great mix of classic rock and new rap including some great AC/DC cuts. You won't find ANY of that good old stuff on this CD. Want to see how bad this CD is? Go look and see how many copies of it are sitting on the shelves of your local music store. The National chain I went to find it at had 5 slots full of these drink coasters. Ended up buying some other CD's that were on sale. A much better investment than this sound track.
3,review from the Synthesis,"Nelly not only made his motion picture debut with The Longest Yard, he is also responsible for producing its soundtrack. It contains some heavy-hitting tracks that are undoubtedly going to be getting some serious airplay (like the opening track, ""Errtime,"" already has). But whether or not you're going to like this collection pretty much depends on how much you like Nelly and his crew. Drawing stars Jung Tru and King Jacob from his own label Derrty Entertainment, Murphy Lee and Ali from St. Lunatics, and other notables such as Eminem, Nelly compiles an album that will either have you gettin' your groove on, or wondering what the hell a bunch of Top 40-style hip-hop has to do with a football comedy.- Cody PowersSynthesis.net"
4,The Longest Yard,"The Soundtrack is cool and I really enjoy listening to it. Some of the songs such as ""Errtime"",""Bounce like this"",and ""stomp"" you can really jam and dance to. There even were songs that I thought were just fun-filled with comedy such as ""my ballz"". My favorite song off the soundtrack is ""Fly Away"". Its more low-key and I just adore when Nelly is singing rather thanrapping.I would love for that to be the next single. Over all the soundtrack is great and it goes excellent with the movie."
1,This CD is a disaster!!,"I came to the website to hear some of the great music that was in the movie and NONE of the songs I wanted to hear were even on the CD. It's all rap which is rediculous. They should have put some other genre of music on there, but no they think everyone likes rap. Which is NOT TRUE. I hate this CD, because it's focused on one group..people who like rap, so if you don't like rap, DON'T BUY THIS CD!!"
5,LUNATICHIK IS LOVIN IT,"THE LONGEST YARD SOUNDTRACK IS OFF THE CHAIN. IT FEATURES ARTIST LIKE T.I, LIL WAYNE, JUNG TRU, AND W.C (I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM HIM IN A WHILE.) EVERTHING NELLY TOUCHES TURNS PLATINUM. HE RIPPED IT IN FLYAWAY, THE LAST SONG ON THE CD IT KIND OF PUT YOU IN THE MIND OF N DEY SAY FROM THE SUIT ABLUM. PEOPLE TRY TO KNOCK NELLY BECAUSE HE MAKES A LOT OF PARTY MUSIC. BUT THIS ABLUM ALSO SHOW A DEEPER SIDE TO HIM. REGARDLESS TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY WE ALL KNOW THAT NELLY REIGN SUPREME."
4,It was good...but needed more songs from the movie!,"Well this Cd was of the chain but the last song in the movie should of been on it. The movie was amazing but the CD wasnt what I expected. My favorite songa probably would be the song Let'Em Fight, Talking that talk and So Fly. I liked Err time but it gets old quickly."
5,NELLY'S REVIEW,I LIKE THE SOUNDTRACK AND THE MOVIE. I WOULD GIVE BOTH OF THEM ALL 5 STARS PLUS MORE. BUT FOR NELLY SINGLE ERRTIME I THINK THAT SONG IS AIGHT. BUT NELLY IS STILL FINE AND SEXY. AND HE WILL ALWAYS BE. BUT N*E*WAYZ THA SONG AND MOVIE LIKE I SAID EARLIER WILL GET 5 STARS PLUS MORE.
1,This is the sountrack?,"I could have sworn i heard 2 AC/DC tracks in the movie, and they even played Thunderstruck in the trailer and tv spots. Very disappointing. I guess i'm not ""thuggin"" or ""pimpin"" enough to understand the soundtrack"
1,The Longest Yard 2005,Just seen the movie and this soundtrack does not have the music played in the movie.
1,No Rock Songs,This album contains only rap and no rock songs. This was very disappointing to say the least.
3,No History,"While being a decent hiphop album, there is none of the historic music in the movie. No ""16 Tons,"" no heavy blues whatsoever. Really, if you are going to make a soundtrack, have all the music from the film that you can get, not a Nelly and Friends lovefest. This is a good compilation of new hiphop/rap track, without the sense of musical history that the actually movie's sountrack had."
2,"Not what I was hoping for, but not horrible","Well, I was also disappointed that certain songs were missing on the soundtrack. I do not however think it's fair to say this is a CD only for Blacks because it's all rap! That's ridiculous. But, I'll overlook that naive comment & say, even for those of you who do like hip hop, there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing. I loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one (Let 'em Fight?). That's the song I wanted the soundtrack for & I was so disappointed. As for those of you interested in that Lynyrd Skynyrd song playing during the car chase, it's called, ""Saturday Night Special."" The soundtrack wasn't bad, just a disappointment. To see all of the songs that were played in the movie, visit: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398165/soundtrack."
1,NELLLY YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!!!!!,I was way too excited to buy this soundtrack after watching the movie.. and then i got on amazon to order the cd and i looked through the songs and i dont remember hearing any of the songs on the cd in the movie.. the songs in the movie are awesome.. the soundtrack TERRIBLE!DO NOT BUY THIS CD UNLESS YOU WANT ALL RAP/HIP HOP
1,Wrong CD,"I had ordered this CD for my husband.He likes the movie ""The Longest Yard"" and he wanted to get the soundtrack of the movie. Unfortunately at the time of ordering it did not specify what songs were included in the CD, but I thought if it was from The Longest Yard movie, then it would be the soundtrack.Well, I received the package and gave it to my husband for him to open, he started playing it and was very disappointed.He ended up getting a CD full of stupid rap songs. I am not happy with what I received, if I could send it back and get something else I would,but I know it will be a hassle to even ask for an exchange.My suggestion to other people is to find out exactly what they're lookin for before placing an order and just because the cover looks like the original,it does not mean it's what you're really looking for. I only spent $12.00 which is a good thing, but it could have lost a lot more.Thank you"
1,What is Wrong?,"What is wrong with soundtracks nowadays... Soundtracks are suppose to hold songs FROM the movie, and no offense but nelly aint as cracked out as they make him. What happened to the ACDC and the CCR? I mean they played Thunderstruck at the start of the main game!!! I guess people are more into rap now then classic rock..."
4,STOP CRYING,"look the only reason you people are complaining is because of some AC/DC songs...look i appreciate them very much and thunderstruck is an amazing song but NELLY WAS IN THE MOVIE HENCE HIS SONGS THAT THEY PLAYED WILL BE ON THE DANG SOUNDTRACK...if you cant handle that then sorry, the soundtrack is amazing and does blend with the music in the movie, if you cant see that you werent listening when you saw it...STOP WHINING..."
1,Not really the soundtrack!!,"I have to agree...after watching this movie, I really was inspired to look for the soundtrack. Not only are there great songs in this movie that aren't on the CD, but there are songs on the CD that weren't in the movie! What a disappointment."
1,Worst CD Ever Made!!!!!,"I just recently saw The Longest Yard, and I absolutely loved it to death!! It was so funny, and the music in it was off the hook!!! I got so excited from hearing that kind of music in a football film, that I rushed to the nearby WalMart to buy it. To make a long story short, I bought it, listened to it, and almost had a heart attack. WHERE IS THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE??????!!!!!! This soundtrack features one good song from Nelly, but that's all to see, ladies and gentleman. I would rather drink one hundred kegs of beer, get a hangover, and puke my guts up for the rest of my life than listen to this CD!!! Most of the rappers are outstaged "" Today's Hit Music "" artists, and couldn't sing if their own life was on the line!!! So do yourself a favor: DO NOT BUY THIS CD, UNLESS YOU LIKE THIS GAY MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,longest yard cd,Was not happy with the item. Was expecting the orginal soundtrack of the actual movie with adam sandler. Looking for the version with the music that plays during the movie with ac/dc. What I purchased just really wasn't my type of music.
1,Not quite what I expected,"If you like rap, I'm sure you'll dig this soundtrack. I was hoping the soundtrack would have the rock songs that were in the movie and was rather disappointed to find that there was no such luck with that. Oh well..."
1,This not the whole volume. Parts are missing,"Take care !This is a beautiful text but this edition is not the whole and complete volume. I just ordered the 1920 authentic publication. This book claims that it is a strict reproduction (facsmile) of the 1887 edition. The truth is, when you get to the end of this book it says ""end of Vol.1"" Where is the second Volume ?Yes take care. This book is not the complete work. My other book of 1920 that I ordered, is the real complete volume. It has more pages text and illustrations.This work is amazing to have, a true treasure, but you have to find the complete one. In this copy they don't even mention that it is not complete until you read it all and in the end you see the ""end of Vol. 1"" !!!/ don't seek the second volume on this one though..Just make your research and find another edition. I paid 185$ to get my full privately bound leather edition of 1920 circa and I am very very happy with it."
4,Wonderful Rosicrucian Instruction,"This is a book I've long wanted. I'm so glad to find a Cornerstone copy on Kindle. It does seem a bit deep, but a study of it should be very helpful in my growing in Light."
3,"Good product, OK content","You never know what to expect with ELR. That can be good, or it can leave you feeling like, ""Why did I just waste a half hour watching this?"" It has its funny moments, but I get tired of Frank berating Marie (it's way too predictable, and loses its intended humorous effect all too easily), and all the references to sex get old as well. The funniest episodes just have to do with everyday life with Raymond and Debra, and their attempts to keep things together, amidst their own shortcomings, and the constant intrusions of pesky parents and a love starved brother. Probably not worth the purchase, unless you are just an avid ELR fan. Hope it helps!"
3,Little disappointed,"I got the 6th season of Everybody Loves Raymond for my husband, and it arrived in good time and well packaged. However, as we were watching some of the episodes, it had some glitches in it."
5,Everybody Loves Ray,"Seson 6 is just as good as the rest of them. Everybody Loves Ray is a Down To Earth regular ""Good 'Ole Show"". It deals with REAL everyday situations. I just LOVE Ray!!"
4,Great addition to existing collection.,The sixth season was a good addition to my collection of the ELR DVD set.
1,Not happy,"When I received the box I opened it up and the DVDs look like it was stolen from the library. I opened it up and each DVD had a piece of tape in the center of the DVD it just looked like a mess. The other DVDs that I ordered or packaged up nice like I bought them at the store. I understand that they are used, but this is not what I expected"
5,Best Season!,"I adore this show, and this is my favorite season. It is absolutely hilarious! It will not disappoint!"
4,2nd best album,"This is one of Urban Dance Squad's best albums. Mental Gloss is still definetly their very best, but this one captures the spirit and energy of their earlier work. It's too bad UDS never caught on in the states like the Chili Peppers and Rage Against the Machine, but this album is extremely well done."
4,Great start,"Helps you get started in playing very well. Includes all dvds, great bargain on a lot of great info."
1,Worst parts of other Firm videos,"I own a few Firm tapes and enjoy working out to all of them except this one. The tape is compiled of segments that are the worst parts of other Firm videos - the cueing is off, the instructors mumble, the audio is horrible and the choreography is confusing. I have couple of other tapes with pretty much the same instructors (Firm Parts -Upper Body, Maximum Body Shaping Mix) and their quality in terms of moves and cueing are ten times better. Unlike other reviewers, this video did not raise by heart rate much and I found it to be too easy. There is nothing tough about this aerobic mix at all and its poorly choreographed. Save your money and buy Firm's Super Cardio instead."
3,Kurt Vonnegut?,"Kurt Vonnegut references in the album title, which is a line from his book ""God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"", and the first track title is a mix of his books ""Welcome to the Monkey House"" and ""Slaughterhouse-Five"", all good reads.Have a great day everyone :)"
2,I wasn't impressed,"I checked this cookbook out from the library and am glad I didn't buy it. The recipes don't look that appetizing, and many of them use ingredients that I'd have to search all over for in a normal grocery store, or go to a specialty store for. I don't think these recipes qualify as ""easy, everyday ideas."""
4,Cheesy but fun.,This is one of the movies that you watch so you can make comments about it all the way through. It is a cheesy but fun movie with outlandish acting.
4,Their Best Recording,"Bad Company actually explores a few new styles here. The softer tunes(Silver, Blue, And Gold, Love Me Somebody, Simple Man, and Fade Away) are quite good and add some diversity to this band's repertoire. The rockers are up to par and the cover version of Youngblood is done with flair and panache. Even the silver(grey) album cover is quite interesting from an artistic standpoint. A very nice package."
4,A great Rock 'n Roll treasure that is true 70's rock,"This album seems to match the power and punch that Straight Shooter has but with a few more up beat/ rockin' numbers like the title track ""Run with the Pack"". If you like "" Bad Company"" and ""Straight Shooter"" you will want this one for you collection."
4,This Pack is worth Running with,"Bad Company's third album is a butt kicker. Not a weak song to be had anywhere on here...only one minor hit single with the cover of ""Youngblood"" but the rest of the album is solid with ""Silver Blue and Gold"" and ""Running with the Pack"" getting the most airplay on Rock Radio. The band pretty much peaked around this time as none of their albums released after this stand up to this or the earlier two releases."
4,Still runnin'!,"This album is just as good as I remembered it to be, seeing as how I haven't listened to it for probably 15 years. I rank this one almost as high as their first (Bad Company +5) and second (Straight Shooter ++5). Probably not as many outright hits as the first two but certainly a good effort. Brings back many good memories!"
3,Another strong entry into their catalog,Good tunes with some rockers and also some with great lyrics to sing along with that showcase their total band sound as true rockers.
2,"CD new, case cracked and scratched","The CD was sealed, but the case was cracked in a couple places and scratched up."
5,Best company,"Run with the pack would be my favourite Bad Co album.The first two albums coming very close to this one, but there is something more in Run With...it's more bluesy and the production defenitly catches the deep soul feeling of each songs.Sure it doesn't contain a smashing hit like the previous albums did, but the feel is just right and the smoothness of the voice, the instrumentation and the production makes it just incredibly profound and dangerous...a highway at night.Probably also the FREE-est Bad Co album, very mature and intense."
2,Glue residue all over products,I got the packages for my product quickly but it seems to lack of quality control was why. I got two kits and several boxes of shelves. The kits had tons of glue residue (this is particle board with laminate over it) on the panels both on the seams and on the face of the panels where glue wasn't even applied. There was less glue on the shelves but still every box had glue residue on the pieces.I contacted the company and asked for a resolution - they suggested a cleaner I could not find or said they would replace the products. I did not want to wait 3 weeks to ship the parts back and forth and still have glue all over the pieces (I had no confidence given there was glue on all the pieces). I bought some goo gone which worked okay but they refused to pay the $5 for the cleaning product (let alone the 3 hours it took).Disappointing!!!
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!! Buyer Beware . . .,"Like all the other reviews, if you purchase a ""3-DVD Set"", you think you are going to get a little more than 3-5 episodes of the show -- No full episodes of the old black & white show, only the new color 1970s version. Only one skit from the old show (but it is the great one with Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and Trini Lopez). At $14.99, it's not too much of a rip-off to see Soupy Sales, but it is still false advertising."
2,The Whole Gang Is Here - but only in 4 episodes and 2 clips,"First off, I was never lucky enough to see the original 1960's Soupy Sales series but grew up during (and enjoyed) the 70's revival. When I first read about this set I was looking forward to it but found myself a bit disappointed that for a 3 DVD set the content was so limited.Between 3 discs you get just 4 shows from the 70's series and only two segments from the original 60's run, the Frank Sinatra - Sammy Davis Jr. restaurant skit and the stripper at the door(no image blocking here!) blooper.If you're a Soupy Sales fan, think about it. The shows were fun I just wish there had been more included or at least it should have been released as a 1 disc collection so expectations weren't so high."
2,Disappointing,"I was so thrilled to see Soupy Sales on DVD, thinking it would contain his old stuff from the 50's/60's. It had very little of that on the DVD--just enough to leave you wanting more. His later material is not funny, which is mostly what is on thie DVD. Save your money."
2,Soupy in limited doses,"The set-ups of the weird folks knocking at Soupy's door is hilarious just for what it is; the conversations with White Fang and Black Tooth tickle the silly bone quite well. Charismatic as Soupy Sales is, however, it is hard to watch these shows for too long on account of their extremely corny, poorly written comedy skits. WIsh they had provided Soupy with good writers back then instead of letting him, apparently, wing it on his own, often with the most embarassingly bad jokes and puns. Once and a while they provide a good laugh, however. Soupy does light up the screen."
3,hmmm,"i'm on the fence. the packaging looks good, although there is no mention of running time. and since you can't go online at best buy, i had to come home to find that every disk is a bit over an hour (but that also includes full commercials).to buy or not to buy. i love Soupy (who doesn't? the guy is a legend!) ....but i love and fondly remember the black and whites - and i firmly believe that someone somewhere has the footage...whaddya think gang???"
1,Rip off,"Out of three disks you have only 2 full shows.The other are snipits from the New Soupy show, not the one we all remember.Vitage commercials last longer than snippits.If you like Soupy look around and save your money on this one."
3,Don't buy many DVDs. Really glad I got this one.,"I don't but many DVDs these days. Money is tight. But Soupy Sales has always been one of my favorites for so many years.When my wife saw this DVD available on Amazon, she said we had to buy it. I wans't sure we should spend the money, but am I ever glad we did. When it arrived, we put in the DVD and we were only going to watch a little bit before heading out. We ended up laughing so hard, we watched the entire first DVD.We had to go, but we rushed home to watch the other two. We were glad we did. We laughed so hard that tears were running down our cheeks. I highly recommend this to people who grew up with Soupy Sales and to people who heard of him but never got to watch his great talent in action. Thanks Amazon for the great service and thanks to the people who made this colelction. My wife and I are looking forward to getting more Soupy Sales DVDs as soon as they put them out."
4,Great Car for a Toddler,"My 2 year old loves this car and all the noises it makes. It's very sturdy as he has thrown/dropped it several times and it is still going strong. With only 2 buttons, it's very simply and easy for a toddler to work. It works off of infrared (like a tv remote) and not an antenna like most cars, so you have to have the remote perfectly pointed at the car's rear where the sensor is. You have to be more at the car's level for it to work well, which is no problem for a toddler. Overall, we've had a lot of fun with it."
3,Cell Phone Battery With The Least Capacity,"The picture displays a BT60, but BargainCell doesn't have that battery and BargainCell sends a BT50, which has the least capacity of any battery for my cell phone. When I complained BargainCell immediately refunded my money and took the battery back. The battery is OK if you just want a second working battery and don't care about capacity."
5,So faithful and practical!,"This book is great! I love the way it integrates authentic Church teaching with really practical parenting advice. I only got it two weeks ago, and the techniques are already making a huge differences in my childrens' behavior. I really look to it on those days when I'm not sure what to do to keep things on track. I only wish I knew about it sooner! I know what I'm giving as gifts to my mother's support group. Thanks for this great resource."
2,Not so great,"I bought this book hoping for some help with my willful toddler. It came highly recommended by a friend. I was pretty disappointed in the book, because it's so pro-attachment parenting that it makes all other parents feel guilty. I don't do some of the attachment parenting in the book for legitimate, important reasons (sleeping with my infant--not so excited about the possibility of rolling over on my baby, breastfeeding--am unable to). It was frustrating that he was so bent on this perspective that I literally could not garner anything from the book. If you are not extreme attachment parents, this book probably isn't for you. For us, it was a waste of money."
5,Terrific,This is just a really terrific book. I has been a great companion for years and the new edition is great. Highly reccomended!
5,thanks for the tons of practical advice,"This book gives a great overview of parenting but unlike other parenting books I have read, it goes a step farther and gives very detailed examples for all stages of childhood and teen years. Popcak's ideas on Catholic parenting are supported by many quotes from John Paul II. This is a book worth reading and re-reading"
3,Farberware food storage container set,"Farberware 40-pc. Citrus SetThis plastic food container set is average. The colors are pretty, but the containers are smaller than expected and the lids are a little flimsy. The lids do seal well however, overall I would say that this is a decent set if your not willing to spend the money on exspensive Tupperware."
3,Caught Up,"Suspence was very good. Romance was a ""I kind of seen it coming"". The entire collection by Gayle Roper is good."
5,Buy this CD!!,"I once read a review of a Dave Edmunds album where a critic said that one day Edmunds would release a truly great rock and roll album. The critic obviously had never listened to Get It. An absolutely smoking album. The cover of Bob Seegar's ""Get out of Denver"" may be the fastest paced song ever recorded. Plus a cover of the Sinatra tune ""Where or When."" From start to finish, a great work."
1,"Anti-Arab, Anti-Islam Propaganda","Don't look for actual documentary information in this video. Produced by JerusalemOnlineU.com, a diploma mill exposed by Forward magazine ([...])and directed by South African Wayne Kopping, who also did such objective ""documentaries"" as Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West; Crossing the Line: The Intifada Comes to Campus; and The Third Jihad.This video is Israeli hasbara (propaganda). A 55-min. infomercial. Avoid."
2,Advertisement only,"The ""movie"" is a simple piece of paid by Israeli institutions PR advertisement that has the chutzpa to let you pay for seeing it instead of paying you for. This is part of a concentrated Israeli campaign to counter the world public opinion and the majority Diaspora Jewish view on Israel and its anti-democratic development.It's really a fine piece of trash."
4,"Amazing, Indeed","The Beatles re-incarnated as Seattle grunge rockers ? Well, at least, on this album and its predecessor (Frosting On The Beater) its very hard to deny such an admittedly hyperbolic statement. Once the crunchy guitars, soaring harmonies and groovy backbeat get to you, there's no escaping the inevitable: The Posies have laid claim to that part of your brain where sweet melodies rule. Includes numerous could-a-been hits: ""Throwaway"", ""The World"", ""Fight It (If You Want It)"", the beautiful ""Song #1"" and ""Grant Hart"", a tribute to the former Husker Du drummer/singer/songwriter.There's a lot of power pop out there that's either too pop or not enough power. Here's to an album that captures both and isn't afraid to give you them in the right dosage."
3,Daily Mutilation,"This is one of those CDs that has a few duds that you wish weren't there, spoiling the brew somewhat, but on the plus side some of The Posies' finest tracks are found on this, their farewell release on Geffen. A 6-song sampler issued promotionally for this release is the ideal item to own, as it contains the very best of the lot, including my favorites, ""(Will you ever) Ease your Mind?"", ""Song #1"", ""Fight It (If You Want)"", and ""Throwaway"". Geffen promoted ""Please Return It"" and then ""Ontario"" as singles, but they were obviously the wrong songs; neither picked up radio play. ""Frosting On the Beater"" is The Posies' classic, and should be heard first, but unless you can find a copy of the sampler CD, pick up ""Amazing Disgrace"" for its highlights, and forgive the band for such awful tracks as ""Everybody..."" and ""Hate Song"", and the mediocre ""Ontario"". Had they been left off, this would have been given a 5 star rating."
5,Another Master Piece of Work,"As a Posie fan I would have to say this is another one of their great albums. It is completely different from there last albums, which gives it a unique individual quality to it. The most obvious change is in the lyrics, and because of this most fans can not follow. The lyrics seem to have become very resentful, almost like they are exploring their inner demons. With these resentful thoughts put into words and played like only The Posies can play, makes this a great album. I absoluelty love this album, just like all there other works. It is a great lose to the music world to lose this band but at least there music can still survive amongest the faithful."
3,Sell Out:Then or Now?,"Why guys?This in many ways is a great album,but as a Posies fan I ask""Is it a Posies album""?Where they've always been cynical in nature,there was also underlying hopefulness in there lyrics.On Disgrace they jump on the Gen-X bandwagon:bash everyone)Fans,friends,even God.How truly trendy,they even use the ""F"" word all the kids are crazy for.All this makes me wonder,which is the true Posies?were they fooling us then,or now?"
3,"Bitter, weird, contemptuous","If one hasn't *Frosting on the Beater,* one should get one's hands on it pronto. This is just okay -- another new rhythm section, but somehow the previous one took the vaunted knack-for-hooks with them (though one wouldn't have thought it was *theirs*). Glorious exception: ""Throwaway,"" as addictive a tune as these guys ever came up with. But what's good here is available in other configurations, and since understandable doesn't = listenable, it's hard to see why anyone not a Posies fanatic needs this record. (If anyone's interested in writing the long-needed tome explaining the persistent *un*popularity of power pop, this will be a pertinent text (as will the Posies's career in general).)"
4,Under rated Iggy,"The best of his Arista LPs ""Party"" may seem like watered down Iggy on the surface (ie ""accessible"" melodies; that lame cover ""sea of love"") but check out the lyrics: ""Sooner or later, baby, I'm gonna bruse you just like a tomato"", ""When I walked into the rock n roll club I found myself with the usual bums"", ""who left that [...] door half open!"" Despite the ""listenible"" almost mainstream music this was Iggy's most bitter album until ""Beat Em Up""."
3,"""Party"" is definately not his best work","To be brief, I am a fan of Iggy Pop, but this cd just didn't cut it for me... somehow it lacks the vision, attitude, and artistry of albums such as Soldier and New Values, or Zombie Birdhouse. I just thought I should put my 2 cents in. I listen to those albums constantly. This one I sold back to my local used cd shop."
2,Poorly made,"Very low price with quality to match. I had to sand down one leg to level the level itself so it would read the same when turned end for end standing on my bench. I had to file out part of the hanging loop for the same reason to get consistent readings on a line. The vial is loose and can be rotated in the housing, which changes the readings (or can aid in adjusting the level). Not dependable. I bought it because it had the extra markings for drainage slope."
2,If this is the 1 st running book that you read ..otherwise,"This book has nothing new to offer but rather it consists of mostly general and repeated information that you have read about from other running books. Buy and read book like ""explosive running"" which provides a new level and different prespective of data and information."
5,Great Watch,"Got this watch as a gift... If I paid $100 for this watch, I'd be satisfied. I always have it running one minute ahead, and at the end of the month it's still one minute ahead. When changing the date (at the end of the month) it takes me a few tries to get it to just change the date (instead of the time), but eventually I get it right. I love cheap watches, but hate cheap feeling watches, and this is definitely not a cheap feeling watch. Unfortunately one of the bracelet rods broke recently, but it should be an easy fix (once I get around to finding my extra links). I'm very happy with it otherwise (especially after seeing that it's even cheaper than $100)."
2,disapointed,"Product arrived on time and in good condition....the problem is they are not purple....they are pink.I ordered them because our company color is purple, so it would have been nice to know that they are not purple at all when lit."
1,WHUT,WHY IS THIS THING SO EXPENSIVE!? I DON'T GET IT. ITS JUST A STUFFED ANIMAL! I WANT TO GET IT FOR A FRIEND AND ITS SO EXPENSIVE!
1,I do not recommend purchasing this unit.,This unit did not work and I returned it to Coby for a refund. Their customer service department told me I needed to send them another $6.00 for them to send it back to me so that I could send it to Amazon. This was after I paid $10.00 to ship it to Coby in the first place! I found Coby's customer service department to be very rude and unaccommodating. They also didn't list in their product description all the things that I would consider standard that this unit does not come with and they told me I could just buy the adaptor and other accessories that should come with a unit like this. Amazon.com stepped in with great customer service and gave me a full refund. This will be the last time I buy from COBY.
3,Not the best monologue book,This book contains two parts. The first part tells you how to write a monologue. The second is a compilation of interviews with one-person show actors and actresses. It is the second part I find most informative where each artist tells what this type of performance means to him. One artist describes it as theatre where the audience is part of the cast. Very true. But I find the monologue writing part of the book useless. Nothing I don't already know. The monologues included in the book are not much better.
2,Virtually unreadable,"I thought How Late it Was, How Late was excellent and one of the best books I have read in the past couple of years. So, I had high expectations after hearing about Translated Accounts. The premise of the book is intriguing but the language and repetitiveness of the book made a worthwhile story unbearable."
5,Will save you $$,"Have used these for years. Unfortunately, they have become difficult to find at stores (even Office Depot), but I do 80% of my shopping at Amazon, so was not disappointed.These mini sheets are perforated into 2, 4-part sections, each containing four ready-to-print-on labels, and you can easily do so from many labeling software, including Microsoft Word, and Avery-Dennison's free yet powerful ""DesignPro 5.""Since my business is very small, I am able to print mailing addresses for even one order per day, without having to print an entire sheet, wasting expensive ink. I even use the labels to send birthday cards to family members!Using the Avery brand, never have I had any issues regarding a label not fresh enough to stick properly, and I have been using them since round 1998.That the package takes up less than half the space as the huge, ""normal"" package is a benefit as well.Do not hesitate to order these, as the price is right and the benefits to you are generous!"
4,Alex shines on his own track.,"I already reviewed this below, but I realized that I was a bit harsh on the singer, and failed to mention that this album contains one track, ""What Do I Know"" that is both written and sung by Alex Lowe, and it is very good. To me he sounds better than ever singing his own words. (Andy's background vocals on this song are great as well.) This track shows real potential for Alex's new band, MILO, if they ever get a record deal."
3,From hurricane to tropical storm.,"The first record as a complete band. Like their peers Embrace, H1 have a strange fetish for images of 60's black America, which they proudly display on their record covers. While this is an easy target for idle mockery, it shows how concered they are to stress their 'authenticity'. This album is full of elements best described in inverted commas. Typically, a song begins witha funky beat, moves on to a smoking guitar riff and then alights on some weird synth effects. Overall they miss the energetic record that the public was seeking. Some of the songs 'NYC' and 'Twilight World' do sustain the elusive rushes of energy post Oasis rockers strive for."
5,Its all u want and MORE,It starts off with the title track.... that had an R&B flvor pumped with hot beats. Awesome dance song good for any party. And to top it off... They give you the instrumental in case u ever get the guts up to ahve a spontaneous karoke night ;)
5,It's Goona Be a Hit,"It's Gonna Be Me is the 2nd single off ""No Strings Attached."" It has the best upbead rythum and sound that just wants to make up get on your feet and start dancing. It's about someone saying they you've been hurt, but when you fall in love again, It's Gonna Be Me. This song has shown how nsync has grown into artista and not just a band. And it sets then apart from the rest(I.E. BSB). Buy this single today!"
5,its gonna be me,"i luv this song! the guys of nsync are soooooo talented, not to mention they are very cute! he he, this is like the greatest song on their new cd! i suggest it."
5,"A great, up beat song for dancing","I love ""It's Gonna Be Me,"", so of course I had to buy the single! It is a great song that makes you sing along and dance!"
4,It's good...,"IGBM is a good pop song. I heard that Justin did the beatbox throughout the song, which I thought was computer-generated, so the kid has SOME talent. As always, JC Chasez shines vocally. Overall, it's an excellent song, definitely not the best the group could do, but it gets you moving."
5,An Excellent Planning Resource,"Having spent over three years in motion overseas, I have come to appreciate a guidebook that can blend the practical and cultural in a concise treatment. The Rough Guide to Iceland does this skillfully, and it is well-organized to boot. You'd use the Rough Guide to plan and layout your trip and then keep it by your side as your interpretive companionWhile the Lonely Planet guide to Iceland contains more detail on logistics, it is not particularly user-friendly. That being said, I'll buy a copy of the Lonely Planet Guide to supplement the Rough Guide. Lonely Planet Guides have seen me through more difficulties than I can count, and I'm sure the Iceland edition will get me out of a few jams while I circle the country.But if I could use only one book, it would be the Rough Guide"
1,Completely Useless,"This book fails to disclose that Reykjavik is nothing more than a drinking town (24/7) in the Summer for 20 year olds from Europe. It provides no recommendation for those who want to stay ""in town"" yet stay away from all of the drunks. Everything in the book is described as expensive and pricey. Being from NY and having traveled the world, given the choice of a two hour bus ride from hell to get dropped off three blocks from my dump of a hotel or a pricey 45 minute cab ride, I'll opt for the cab any day. It's perfectely written for those who want to hike and see the country, and live out of their back pack, which is fine. For those who want to experience culture, explore the geologic uniqueness that Iceland has to offer and are not so cheap that they shouldn't be going on vacation anyway, this book is NOT for you. Why not write a travel guide that accurately describes the realities of travel?"
3,Leisure indeed,"Edward Cecil had a well-deserved reputation as a wit and this posthumously-published book demonstrates his talent in full measure. I laughed out loud at some of his hilarious descriptions of life as a British official in the Egyptian government of the late 19th century.Like most writers of his time, he gives the Egyptians little credit for anything while accepting as virtuous the Empire's occupation of Egypt. He doesn't attempt any examination of the complex issues surrounding the occupation but that isn't his goal with the book anyway (Farman, Blunt, and others do that to varying degrees outside of Cromer).Cecil doesn't spare his fatuous, stiff colleagues either. He's an equal opportunity skewerer and would perhaps have run with the Monty Python crowd in our day (well, maybe not). It's mostly a very light romp through colonial bureaucracy."
5,Wonderful wit,"This book is a classic. One of the truly great wits of his time reflecting on the exotic world of late nineteenth century Egypt. His description of Egyptian civil servants and the German ambassador reduced me to tears of laughter. A wonderful, wonderful read which welcomes you back for refresher reads"
1,Double DVD Album Case,"Low quality, cheap and flimsy. Some of the cases did not survive the first opening without cracking. I would not recommend these case except for the cheapest giveaway DVDs. Not a bargain, even at HALF the price."
3,So-so.,"These are alright, but I was hoping for better. The plastic is, in my opinion, slightly too soft, and therefore subject to more warping and bending than I like. The clips held the discs securely, it seemed; but rubbed up against the opposing disc more than I was comfortable with. Another reviewer called them ""flimsy."" I think that description is apt.The seller made no promises about quality, so I guess I should have taken the low price as an indication..."
4,Slim-line double disc saves space.,"I've bought 200 of these so far and planning on buying another 100. Not one has been broken and haven't had any trouble with any of them. They might not be the best quality but they work fine. These slim-line double disc cases save a lot of space! Basically, you can get 4 discs in the space of one normal dvd case on your shelf."
4,Multi disc albums are great.,"4 of the albums were damaged. No problems with return, but did not have another shipment available. Ordered standard size and I like that size much better.Transferring all my VHS to DVD. The two (multi) disc albums are great! Some of my movies I have different versions of, others are a series, I can use one album instead of multiple albums."
5,Wonderful reference,It is an excellent book to know Korea. I introduced it to the people around me and might buy more to give the gifts to my friends.
3,Small but Powerful,"This loupe is very small as mentioned in another review; there should be something in the photo to give the buyer a sense of scale (such as a dime). That said, it is a powerful 20X loupe with crystal clear magnification. Spend the time needed to get used to the size and reward yourself with a great tool."
2,B&L 20X Triplet Hard To Use Get The 10X Instead,"For most applications the 20 power Hastings Triplet is a little too powerful and too small to use and is lost easily. I would suggest the 10 power Hastings Triplet which is larger and has a greater field of vision. I have purchased many ""triplets"" during the last 25 years and find that it is wise to get a Bausch & Lomb or better 10 power triplet. Some cheaper ones have one thick lens and therefore are not triplets which should have 3 lens for optimal field depth and less distortion. Other cheap loupes fall apart almost immediately or the lens section falls out causing dirt and grease to accumulate. B&L is a fine loupe but the twenty power loupe has very limited applications."
4,Fluffy was it for 1997,Can't decide between Plexi of Fluffy for best music of 1997. Though it is definitely between the two! The anger and honesty of Fluffy send me cart-wheeling back in time to '77! Anyone recall the slits?
1,The Big Rip Off!,"I regret ever buying this collection of loops. I was so excited when I first seen this product, thinking I can finally have steel and lap steel guitar in my songs. Wrong, these loops are about impossible to use in songs. They are very bland licks and they are very limited. There are not very many loops to choose from and they are not tempo friendly if you are trying to adjust them. The guitar licks do not sound country at all and the bass is very weak. Do not waste your money on this product."
2,It's alright...,"There are definitely some samples I can use on this set, but my biggest complaint is that the files are not acidized. Because of this, I had to do a lot of chopping up and time stretching of the loops included. I'm glad I bought this on Amazon, however, because I really don't feel that the loops are worth the retail price of $50. You can find free legal (and sometimes acidized) loops all over the internet. Some of those would be worth more if a price tag was attached to them."
3,okay,"I like the charm bracelet, but hate the clasp, it keeps undoing other than that its very pretty and inspirational. It makes a simple and cheap gift with a message! comes with a gift box decorated and all, with satin touch inside. Good for teachers and nurses and co-workers (there are several other charms to pick from)"
2,Bracelet review,I purchased this as a gift to send to a friend in the UK. I chose the option to ship it directly to her. It would not allow me to request gift wrap or even to include a note.
2,Product arrived already broken!,"I ordered 10 of these bracelets as holiday gifts for my nieces. Of the 10 ordered 4 arrived already broken (the filigree heart was split open and disconnected). They are prettily packaged and are reasonably attrative, but you have a 2 in 5 chance of receiving a defective item based on my experience. I am seldom disappointed by my orders with Amazon, but this takes the cake."
1,unhappy with quality,I bought two bracelets from this company. Was excited they were beautiful but broke first time it was put on!
5,Just beautiful!,"My 12-year-old daughter had this bracelet on her Amazon Wish List, and I got it for her for Christmas. It's beautiful and very well-made. Even the packaging is just lovely. Highly recommended! Edited to add: The light blue gift box is gorgeous. I didn't even wrap it!"
4,Gift for sis-n-law,It was better than I expected. At first I wasnt sure about it but I actually would like one for myself. Really pretty.
3,Very pretty but not the best quility,"I think the price should be a bit lower for the quility of the product. I purchased this for my mother on Christmas, its nice and she was happy with it but it looked like I bought it at a dollar store. A+ for packaging. It made it look more expensive"
4,review,It as a very nice bracelet. It was shorter than i expected but it was very pretty and the box was beautiful.
3,Straight Shooter,"Bad Company's second studio effort was a tremendous drop off from their first. Unlike their debut album, this one has some definite filler. And, honestly, after this album, there's no need to delve any further into their studio albums, you'll hear a definite thud with each subsequent release. Best songs on this album are ""Good Lovin' Gone Bad"" & ""Feel Like Makin' Love"" (one of their best). Most people love ""Shooting Star"" but it's not one of my favorites (does trite come to mind?). ""Deal With the Preacher"" is a good album cut but the rest is filler. There was so much promise to this group that never happened, perhaps they were truly a dinosaur, already out of place before their eventual demise."
3,One Of The All Time Great Album Covers!!!!!!!,"The above CD/record musicwise is of mereordinary value. The group more or less repeats their slam bam thank you maam formula from their debut recording with slightly less successful results. Shooting Star is a really beautiful song though and Deal With The Preacher, Feel Like Making Love and a couple of others are interesting as well. However, what makes this album stand out is the cover of the red dice on a craps table. The album jacket is a winner too as there is a shot of the band from the rear in cowboy duds and flip the jacket around and you see them dressed to the nines. Throw in the cover and album elevates to a 3 and a half rating."
3,Two hits but the rest is Bad Company leftovers and filler,"""Straight Shooter"" is a rather ironic title because for Bad Company's second album, which came out in 1975 a year after their multi-platinum self-titled debut, because a lot of their material was written back in 1973 and obviously rejected for that first effort. However, the two best songs were added by vocalist Paul Rodgers, ""Shooting Star"" and the Grammy-winning ""Fell Like Makin' Love,"" but those are counter-balanced by a couple of fillers from drummer Simon Kirke. Rodgers wrote two solid songs but you can pick them both up on ""10 from 6,"" the Bad Company hits collection. If they had taken those two songs and added them to ""Run with the Pack,"" then they would have had a second album almost as strong as their debut. Unfortunately, that did not happen and while Bad Company brought back stripped down back to the basics rock 'n' roll, they literally had half of their greatest songs on their first album."
4,"Great, great album. Bad Company at it's best",Don't need to look any further if you like Bad Company at all. This one's a winner.
4,Bad Company one of there Best,"Too bad they had to go there seperate ways and thank god they have gotten wise .Free to BadCo The Firm and The Law .Whatever Paul touches it turns to gold hes one of Rocks and Musics best singers ever. But hes at his best being BAD when hes with simon and the rest of those distinctive bad co boys its like magic sing along all the time. Great Lyrics and Real my fav is ""Shooting Star"" Story of a Rock n Rollers riseand fall from the wild and dangerous takin for granted reality of making it big. The ultimate clasic story tune that makes you smile nod your head then ""shed a tear drop in your eye but dont cry moma theres more tunes to carry this classic lp its like a great book you just cant lay it down but this lp you will turn it up and smile as Paul and the rest of the classic boyz lay it down big time for all of true rockers hearts n souls touching lp one of rocks"
5,Another solid Rocker,"Bad CompanyStraight ShooterThree of the tracks on this one CD are Rock classics, and the rest of the album is excellent as well. This is the second of five straight great albums from the group. ""Straight Shooter"" earns Five Stars."
4,Here's the one to buy,"Besides the obvious ""Shooting Star"" and ""Feel Like Making Love"" (Best marriage of music and lyrics EVER) there is another gem on this cd called ""Call On Me"" that strays slightly from the Bad Co formula.I must recommend this for all rock fans."
2,"Some good, some bad, too much Gin Blossoms","Songs like ""Suitcase,"" ""Lizardrin,"" and ""She Came On"" are shiny power pop nuggets. Most of the tracks here drag, though, and some of the better ones have a slick sheen that is far to reminiscent of the Gin Blossoms for my tastes.Super Deluxe's Via Satellite album is a little bit better than this one. Both albums can probably be found in a cut-out bin near you."
4,nice set,"Bought this for my husband to use in his police cruiser. Both work fine so far. The cord is sturdy enough so they don't flop over, and the fan does put out a bit of a breeze (he hasn't used this much yet, since it's still winter). Fan blades are vinyl material, so tey wont hurt you if you touch then when the fan is going. The light only has one (blueish) LED, so it won't really light up everything, but will give a bit of ambient light so you can see your papers/keyboard without an overhead light.All in all, since some of the lights alone are $20 (granted, they generally have more LEDs), I think this is a nice deal."
3,No switch and expensive,"Fan works well. It creates a nice quiet breeze that effectively cools your face while working on a laptop or a PC with a monitor that has a USB plug. The fan does not have a switch allowing you to turn it off. Also less expensive fans have not only an on/off switch but a light in the tip of the fan to keep you aware that the fan is on so you don't startle yourself if you put your hand in the blades. If you do put your hand in the blades, the most that can happen is being startled.The light is effective at illuminating the keyboard of your laptop or allowing you to see behind your desktop PC. Again, there is no switch to turn it off, if you are planning to use it permanently plugged in.The fan will not cool a hot PC and the light will not illuminate your desk.Together, I think they are expensive. You can get really inexpensive versions with switches that will last as long and allow you more flexibility in use."
2,Laptop lite and Fan U14,I bought this product as a gift for my daughters and they now have them so I can not tell you how they are but from the looks of them when I was wrapping them they looked like they might help see the key board of laptop a lot better especially in low light as for the fan without trying it would be hard to be able to say how it works.Thank YouSandra Ayotte
5,Best USB fan & light,"the best option for a USB fan and light small, flexible, is not a powerful fan, but does the work, and the light is jut fine"
3,"Nice light, bad fan","I got this because I often work at home while others are sleeping AND I always think it is hot while everyone else is cold.As soon as I got this product, I was ecstatic. The breeze from the quiet fan was not so strong that it blew away papers on my desk, but it made a huge difference. I literally went from sweating to comfortable instantly. As an added bonus, the fan was very direct and I could aim it precisely.All this came crashing down, though, when the fan up and died a month after I got it. It seems to overheat at the USB port and doesn't fit very snugly.The light is nice and useful."
2,Very Limited Lifespan,Its a great fan in the beginning but it does not last past 1 month before it burns itself out if its used constantly. I have tried 3 different ones and the same thing happens. Stock up on them.
1,Horrible and noisy,This thing was quite for the first couple of days and now its pretty loud...to the point where I cant handle the noise.Waste of money on this fan.Its not vibrating off the usb outlet...the actual fan is loud. If you put some pressure on it it then quiets down.
1,Awful,I got this fan because it looked tougher than the cheapo plastic ones. It lasted about 30 minutes before it died on me. Totally useless and cheap.
4,Not so bad,The usb fan is good to use. For the usb light offered enough light to check the laptop's keyboard. So I think that the usb light is okay for me.
2,"Good Light, Short Life",This is a very well designed light and works very well. You have better control of the light vs. snake neck light types. The quailty of light put out is good and is not so bright as to create glare. There is one major flaw in this light. It has a very short life span. It died after only two months!
2,Lasted 1 month,This product looked light it was one of the best made USB lights/fans out there except the light and the fan burned out after 1 month of use because of overheating.
2,Targus Notebook USB light,When it worked it worked good enough to see the keyboard but did not last more then a few weeks. You may want to look else where for a USB light. Or take your chance and get one and hope it last for then a few weeks. Maybe I got a bad one.
1,Not happy,After receiving this light & fan I am not happy with output of light or fan... Sub standard product... Would not forward to a friend
5,Excellent hard drive !,"I wanted a larger hard drive. So I ordered this one. I couldn,t be happier. I have always trusted Western Digital products. Thank You !"
5,It Continues to Do the Job,I have used one of these since Jr. High shop class 30 years ago. It is a great tool to use for setting the center of a drill or screw hole on wood. Just place the point on your mark and whack it with the heel of your hand. That little dimple will keep your drill on mark or break enough fiber to give your screw a grip. It is a basic hand tool that should be in every woodworkers war chest.
1,Not USA made,"Chinese made, not made in the USA. Stanley has outsourced many of its production lines, and this one is now included."
2,Better ones out there,"I do not recommend this awl. There are better ones out there. I had an older stanley that was great until I lost it on a job. The ""steel"" is weak and I doubt it will last. Point was not machined properly at the tip...I had to grind it a little to form a point."
3,Stanley Scratch Awl,"one reviewer said it was just like the ones made years ago....I have one made years ago and this one is NOTHING like it. The one from years ago had much better steel and thicker too. It also had a metal cap so you could tap it with a hammer and it had an audiable ""ping"" to it when tapped with a hammer which sounded like quality. The old one also had a larger wooden head.This new one does not have any of those features. It is also made in .....you guessed it ""China"". It's not just Stanley who are sending their tools over seas and to Mexico. But that's a different story. If you want a ""cheap"" awl to get by...this is it, if you want a quality awl...look somewhere else."
5,Baudelaire,"Service was prompt, as promised. Product in good enough condition. I bought it in order to better understand the background of the author's famous poem ""Hymn to Beauty."" I greatly appreciate Amazon's resources. Thank you!"
4,You will definately need to really understand his writing be,I thought this book was difficult to get into to but there are sharp questions to hit on throughtout it.
3,Its OK,I would have preferred a more detailed description of the racquet describing the wrap around the handle and what the other side looked like.
3,Not quite as expected,"We have friends who have Diller paddles, and when purchasing these did not realize they were different [shorter, unfinished] Probably wouldn't get this exact paddle again"
4,I have noticed this one....,"This does seem to help with digestion, I actually did notice a difference taking this so will continue to. I'd read alot about Magnesium and how most people don't have enough of it in their systems so decided this would be a decent one to try, I will continue to take it. : )"
1,Broke within an hour,"Just using it to cut braid fishing line, not wire or pennies or anything strenuous. The handle simply broke off at the front of the finger loop. Junk!"
3,"Good, if you do not need top quality","Cutting edges and metal finish are not top quality, but it would definitely strong and sharp enough to get the job done. OK for a low-mileage first aid kit, but I wouldn't recommend to a professional. We got the full size and mini, and I have the same review for each."
5,Great Music,"This is one of my favorite albums. It may have been the first LP that I bought for myself as a teenager - yes I am that old. I more recently bought it on CD. Some of the best songs ever are on it. They don't make music like this anymore, unfortunately."
5,"Metaphysical, dude","Excellent from start to finish. Zeppelin's best, and one of the greatest albums of all time."
1,A Very Disappointing Book...,"Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1995, ""Adam Smith"" refers to Blindside as an ""alarum."" He is far too generous. That this unbalanced collection of anecdotal reasoning, historical inaccuracies, and revisionist tripe managed to capture the imaginations of so many respectable thinkers wishing to keep the ""economic juggernaut"" flames alive in the Nineties speaks volumes as to the extent of the ideological problems within Japan Studies.Thankfully, with 92 days remaining until the end of Mr. Fingleton's punditry career, protectionists, mercantilists and AFL-CIO members will have to look elsewhere for indirect justification of their own political views. Despite Mr. Fingleton's assertion to the contrary, Japan will not be ""overtaking the U.S. by the year 2,000""...if ever. Reality beckons."
2,Isn't it time to stop worrying about the Japan threat?,"This is another in a long line of ""mercantilism"" books on how other nations are going to overtake the US. These books view global economic activity as a zero sum game in which nations gain only at the expense of other nations. This idea fell out of favor in the economics profession in the 1700's but remains a favorite in pop economics. In fact we benefit from economic prosperity overseas: it means better, cheaper goods for us to buy and growing markets for our goods. Unfortunately, as recent experience atests, the Japanese have done a great job of producing and marketing industrial products, but have never put together a modern financial/service sector. Japan's economic demise is drag on the global economy and if the global economy is to right itself, we can only hope the title to this book is correct!"
3,Ordinary,"Bad Company's sound is more pop oriented on this collection. By the time you get to side 2 of this recording the impression is that the band has run out of ideas as some of these songs are grossly incomplete. Crazy Circles, Evil Wind, and Early In The Morning are the standouts here."
3,Hey they tried,"""Rock And Roll Fantasy"" and ""Gone 3x"" are all time crankin' party tunes.As for the rest, it was a good attempt to stay in the public eye in those dark days of disco and punk.But you can only go to the well so many times.Not enough here worth recommending."
3,Side 1--Killer Material; Side 2--BLECCH!,"I got this record, Bad Company's Desolation Angels, at the same yard sale where I bought Ted Nugent's debut album when I was a high school student in suburban Indianapolis. I was very impressed with all of the tracks on Side 1 of Angels, from the hit ""Rock & Roll Fantasy"" to ""Early In The Morning""--there was nary a weak track to be found. However, when I flipped the record and listened to the other side, I found all of the songs to be instantly forgettable (save for the fade out in which the singer keeps wailing ""On my way back to Georgia"" in ""Oh Atlanta"".) It's as if Bad Company decided to do two different albums--one, by keeping the ""A"" list material on Side 1 and throwing in the unwanted songs from previous album sessions on Side 2. Not a brilliant marketing ploy by any means."
3,Desolation...not quite yet,"It's a step up from the very mediocre (read mostly boring) release Burning Sky which came out two years earlier. Side One of this album was as strong as Bad Company has ever put out with cuts 1-4 all great. If side two lived up to side one this album would be right up there with Straight Shooter and Bad Company. However side two is just plain dull.Not bad but this album, like ""Burning Sky"" is for Bad Company fans only or completists who just have to have all holes in the catalog filled out."
3,**3/4. Bland,"After their first two albums, ""Bad Co."" and ""Straight Shooter"", Paul Rodgers and Bad Company never really hit their stride again. Sure, there were good songs on most of their albums, sometimes even great ones, but there were a lot of mediocrity as well, and the same thing goes for ""Desolation Angels"".The best songs here are ""Rock n' Roll Fantasy"", ""Gone, Gone, Gone"" and the bluesy, harp-driven ""Oh, Atlanta"", but unfortunately they're also the only really remarkable songs here. The rest just sort of blends together, offering no great highlights, no memorable lyrics, hooks, riffs or anything.It's not that this music is bad, it's just uninspired, and not nearly as distinctive as Bad Company's first two albums, or the output of Paul Rodgers' first band, Free.All in all, ""Desolation Angels"" remains a mediocre record."
4,Classic Bad Co.,"I don't know why people think only the hit of this album is the only good song.It's a very good album,from the first to the last song.Any Bad Co. with the original line up is good,of course some are better than others,and I think this is one of the better ones.There is no doubt the first is the best,but this could be second best.It reminds me of the first two albums a lot.If you like classic rock,or good rock,you can't go wrong with this."
3,India is really too big for books like this,"Do some research and get something that focuses on where you are. I was in Banglore, which makes most of the book worthless (I think the more standard tourism sites tend to be in northern India).Asking locals works well too."
2,Very limited,"This guide is meant to be used by a specific group of travellers, and this should be stated in their cover or title. I left this guide at home and bought another guide for my trip tp India."
3,a little too uptown for my taste,"India is a wonderful country and deserves to be seen from ground level.Frommer Guides are a little bit too nose-in-the air and up town for my taste and for a long stay, they really do not serve a realistic budget.But there are grains of truth and yes, they cover all the spots ... consider it a starting point in your research...If you want to see India, they are ok, if you want to experience India, add other material to your research... the main thing is to be a good guest on your best behavior when you are in India. Do not judge by your own standards.Represent your country well and leave a good impression for travelers that will come after you.Also check out our DVDs on India Topics on AmazonVisually and Respectfully Yours, the story of The Tibetan Photo ProjectVoices in ExileSave Tibet...Why?India 101 hosted by Sazzy Varga"
4,watch case for my husband,This watch case is exactly as it is described. It is beautiful and can hold the larger watches perfectly. My hhusband is very happy with it.
4,"Very Nice Cheap Replica, You Can Also Get the Speeder With Luke, an Ewok and a Stormtrooper (Scout)","Out of the four speederbikes you can get this isn't quite as cool as the ewok (Paploo) or stormtrooper ones and it does look pretty similar to the one with Luke on it. But what works is that because there are all four options to purchase, if you can get them all you can recreate those scenes in Return of the Jedi quite well. The speederbikes fit quite well on the stands (the same stand is used for all titanium vehicles) and don't spin around due to too much weight like a lot of the other vehicles such asthe Millennium FalconorJabba's Desert Skiffdo. The speederbikes are a lot lighter than the other ships too.You can also get theAT-AT(metal camel looking thing) and two legged AT-ST as well in Endor versions as well so you can create quite a nice display if you wish.The only thing that lets this down a bit is the Leia's face, doesn't really look like her."
3,juvenille violence in a winner looser culture,"like his other works, this is a compassionate and clear headed look at what appears to be a growing underclass in Britain today. Many case studies are cited and can be followed up easily (with the help of a decent library)."
4,And One Foot in Blues Nirvana,"This is a solid set from renowned performers who've improved like seasoned timber through the decades. Given their reputation as jocular raconteurs, I'm surprised that a little of their banter with the invited audience didn't make it onto the tapes. After all, it is a live recording, and yet there's something restrained about the air of the night, and even the performances. I hanker still for the elan of,'Music Is Just A Bunch Of Notes', and urge its release as a CD. All the covers are rejuvenated and Fred McDowell's,'You've Got To Move' is inspiring. Koerner's,'I ain't Blue, and Glover's,'Power Tool' demonstrate that their own material is at one with the traditional material. A continuing revelation with KR & G is the density of their playing. What they fit in 2.50 minutes is more potent than many artists achieve in twice the duration. These stories fan out in the mind; deltas of deeply lived feeling."
3,Almost Great,"I'm having similar problems as other users with my camera right now... I was actually reading the customer reviews because I was considering re-getting the same camera because I've loved it so much for the past year! But apparently the lens getting stuck and needing to turn it on and off constantly is something that's part of the camera rather than just part of MY camera...I guess I'll be looking for something else as a replacement, because I'd like a camera that will last me longer than a year."
1,Ashamed it's a Sony!,"I bought this camera because of Sony's history of making excellent products. Boy was I disappointed! After a few weeks the camera would turn off by itself, flash internal diagnostic malfunctions, and basically just refuse to work. Not only is it useless but it burns through batteries (rechargeable and alkalines) faster than the speed of light. I usually got less than 15 pictures or four minutes of video. I could not find my receipt to return it but with shipping and drama I have decided to turn it into a boat anchor instead and live-and-learn. Reading other negative reviews about this product I can only surmise somebody was asleep at the switch when Sony designed this camera. I have continued to grow dissatisfied with other Sony products and will buy from their competitors from now on."
2,Defective camera(s),"This camera died within a week of buying--some kind of ""access"" error. We took it back, and it died again (same error)--this time a couple of months after the exchange. When you turn the camera on, it shuts itself off a couple of seconds later, leaving the shutter open. Very annoying--avoid this camera."
1,"Careful, it works only for a few weeks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","It worked fine the first week. Then the focus stopped working. I sent it to repair. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working. I sent it for repair for the second time. It worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working. Also, it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at SONY!!! They make you wait over an hour!!!Si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for!!!Sony repair reference number: E33175960"
2,not a dependable camera,"the sony cybershot dsc-s600 was a bit disappointing. though it has nice features and a good lense, after only shooting about 25 pictures on the camera, it completely shut down working. now the lense cover won't shut. supposedly brand new camera defective after only one day of use.otherwise, the picture quality was fine and ease of use a good thing. would prefer if the camera came with a neckstrap for safety rather than a flimsy wrist strap.the other problem is that it only uses a duo pro memory card which makes storage a bit more expensive. buyers beware!!!"
2,TERRIBLE RED EYE PROBLEM,"I love SONY cybershot cameras...and though I really like a lot of features of this camera I have to say that the red eye problem is terrible.I previously owned a P72 and never worried about this. Now I have read that these small cameras have this problem because the flash is too close to the lens.I really don't have the time to be fixing pictures on my PC...I wish I could trade the camera, but now I don't know which model to choose..."
5,Just got it and I love it,I was SO pleased and surprised by the shutter speed. I got it on clearance at the place with the big red circles(hint) $99 Can't wait to try out all the bells and whistles. Took completely unfuzzy pictures in a car maoving at 70 MPH Yippee
4,Great Camera for price!,"I bought this camera not too long ago and have had some use out of it. I bought it more for fun and wanted a good digital camera for not a too expensive price. I would say you definatley get your money's worth! For $200 how can you go wrong, not too mention it is 6mxp! Takes excellent pictures, I was amazed at the excellent quality of the pictures! Has the black and white and sepia feature as well, which I also liked! I do highly recommend purchasing at least a 256mb memory pro duo chip, if not a 512mb. Also I would definatley buy the Sony Ni-Mh 2500 batteries for the camera to! As we know, digitals suck power! On the downside, I wish it had a bigger zoom, but thats my only complaint!"
4,VERY well-made and plush....but VERY soft,"Arrived flattened in plastic, but quickly puffed up when opened and fluffed. My husband disliked this at first but after 3-4 nights, I can see that he's sleeping better (but with two pillows!). If this is the MEDIUM, we'll try to find a FIRM next time, although perhaps Feathers and Down are just going to melt away around your head ANYWAY. They cuddle your head and curve up over your ears so you don't hear any noises then you sleep. We slept on them while at several hotel suites recently and I just had to have them. Turns out, we ordered two similar queen pillows (from a different mfg name with the same mfg address) last year! They are certainly beautifully constructed and the fact that they are washable is a big plus (wash and dry with a white tennis shoe!) I'm sure we'll get accustomed to the feel."
4,"Not quite the Ritz, but great pillow.","I read through some of the reviews and was worried about it being too soft, smelling like a coop, etc. As far as firmness... It came pretty flat as another reviewer mentioned, but I through them in the dryer on low heat and fluffed them up and they were quite fluffy and comfortable, and kept their shape through the night. I normally sleep with two pillows, but really only needed one for a change! So as another reviewer mentioned, I do not think I would want a down pillow any firmer than this. One thing I will mention is that it is pretty loud compared to some other down pillows I've had in the past. As far as smell goes, it definitely has a...new, sort of boxed odor but nothing quite like a chicken coop.... lol. Hopefully that was a one time thing. Was able to fix this with some dryer sheets and febreze."
1,Walkfit with some other Kathy Smith Cassette,"I found this tape disappointing - usually I like Kathy Smith, but this one wasn't up to her usual standard. The selections weren't especially energizing. If you're not a country music fan, there's just no reason to buy this tape."
4,Step by Step Guide - but you still have to do it,"This is a simple, step by step guide to network marketing from beginning to end. It's simple and straight forward. The author has obviously been there and done that as they say. Seems to cover every aspect of the profession - but remember. When all is said and done several good books are on the market that outline how to succeed in this business (which I havent) but you still must do what it says. Good read."
3,Nice puzzle - but not for the youngest,"This puzzle is the normal (well made) Lauri construction. Most of the puzzles are great for young children, but some (this being one of them) have pieces that appear to be symmetrical - but are not. It's difficult for the youngest of the age groups to put such pieces into the puzzle.If the non-symmetrical pieces have few projections (like petals) that are non-symmetrical, the puzzles are fine. However, for circular objects (like flowers) with many petals, it's tough for very young children to put those pieces into the puzzle. Other than artistic license, there was no need for the designer to create such pieces."
3,Has It Come To This?,"Has it really come to this? For $7.92, you can buy an MP3 download of this DCC Gold CD. Doesn't that sort of, kind of, a little bit, you know, defeat the purpose of a carefully remastered Gold Disc to compress it to MP3?"
4,Conventional mid-70s hard rock,"Bad Company's self titled debut is still their best studio album. Unfortunately, it never achieves the mastery that lead singer Paul Rodgers's previous band Free did on the brilliant ""Fire and Water."" This album is a fine collection of good but not spectacular hard rock songs. The title song ""Bad Company,"" the hit single ""Can't Get Enough"" and ""Ready For Love"" are probably the best of the batch, with ""Seagull"" trailing along close behind. Any fan of 70s rock will probably find plenty here to keep them content."
4,Sum equal to it's parts,"Paul Rodgers & Simon Kirke - Half of Free. Probably one of the greatest, and most underrated, blues bands of the early '70s. Rodgers voice is one of the most recognizable voices in all rock.Mick Ralphs - On a good day, close to Kossoff in talent. There are many live Mott the Hoople recordings to back that up. A great song writer. Can't Get enough and Movin' On were Mott the Hoople songs that Ian Hunter just didn't have the vocal range for.Boz Burrell - King Crimson. Important prog rock band. Talented bass player. Probably the least known of the four.Between the great song writing, great guitar playing, and Rodgers phenominal voice, they became a staple of AOR stations across the country. This album was their shot across the bow. Probably their best."
3,This ought to ruffle some feathers...,"Great debut album.While Bad Company was far from the best band of the 70's, I will say this...Paul Rodgers is one of the 4 best rock vocalists EVER, along with Robert Plant, Roger Daltrey, and Freddie Mercury. It's just too bad that Rodgers fronted a band with only average musicians. But when it comes to classic rock vocalists, Rodgers was one of the best.I do have to agree with the one reviewer's comment that Bad Company was nothing more than a good garage band. But man, what a lead singer."
4,"Another excellent new ""Superband"" of the 70s... Cool!","Bad Company was one of those ""recycled"" superbands that emerged in the 70s. Under Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Record label, they issued this first album to show that PURE ROCK RULES!!! Paul Rodgers voice is superb. If you want your 70s party to last a little bit longer, get also BC next album, ""Straight Shooter""!"
4,Raw and Honest,"The debut album by this British quartet is straight ahead rock n roll at its finest. The overall sound of instruments is very raw and honest and coupled with the vocal talents of Paul Rodgers, the music is quite ear catching. Lyrically this album like all the other Bad Company albums is a bit weak but the raw energy exhibited by these guys makes this a worthy purchase."
3,Classic Album by a Great band,"I boungh this CD recently, I used to have 10 from 6 a Greatest hits album, but wanted the original album. This one arrived with no scratches and imported into iTunes just fine."
1,Big Hype!!!,"I used this product for a few months and at first I was feeling really good, but after the month wore off I had to take more and more and it seemed like a constant expensive circleI did take the advice of one of your reviewers and went to the health food store and bought a good probiotic and that made a world of difference and I did save a lot of money and got much better results"
1,Blah....Blah....Blah.....Nothing happens!,"This has to be the most boring book I've ever read! Is Colin, our hero, a main character or supporting character because he isn't in the book much. His character isn't developed enough for me to like him. I remember getting to page 257 and thinking 'is anything going to happen in this book?'. The only reason I kept reading was because Elaine Coffman is a favorite author of mine. Actually, I bought the book without reading the reviews because of the author but I don't think I'll make that mistake again - Ashley's review below is absolutely correct!The character dialog is long winded and BORING - taking up entire paragraphs in many instances. Every time I turned a page I thought Blah...Blah....Blah....get on with it!"
1,absolute crap,Within one minute the latch snapped off the battery cober. Put batteries in the remote. No response. DOA not worth the effort to return.
1,"Cheap, didn't work","I have a late 90's Toshiba TV, model CX36H60 (not a combo) and the TV still works fantastically, but the remote broke ages ago. I've been looking for a replacement remote for it and found this remote and all it's promises...but it didn't work. I tried two different brands of new batteries in the cheap battery dept, but it wouldn't turn on the TV. It is very cheap and I sent it back."
1,"Cheap, doesn't work","I installed the batteries, and also tried other sets of NEW batteries, and this thing never worked. I have a Toshiba TV from the 1990's, so it should have worked. I was never able even to see the indicator light work, which means there was probably something wrong with the circuit running from the batteries. So cheap -- do not buy."
1,Non-functional when recieved,I have a 2002 Toshiba TV and the remote doesn't work at all. I'll try exchanging it but by the time shipping adds to the cost this isn't such a good deal.
5,It's truly a miracle,"The Miracle Remote not only has all the functions that the original remote had, but it's easier to use. Great product!"
3,Miracle Remote for Toshiba,Although advertised that this remote is compatible for the Toshiba 20AS26 television it is not a full working remote for this model. Only about half the functions work so it is not a full miracle.
2,Miracle !!,"I bought this for my Dad's TV.....Shows in black came in white........Dad says it's ok, but you have to be right on the TV for it to work..."
4,Great Bible Study for new or young Christaians,"I have been going through this with my 4 children. As I stated in the title, it's a great Bible study for new Christians, young Christians, or non-Christians looking to find out what all this Christianity stuff is about. We talk to our kids about God and spiritual things regularly, so I think the older three kids (7 thru 12) comprehend the vast majority of the study. What they don't understand, they ask questions about and it usually leads to really good conversations."
4,A nice regional cookbook,"Authentic Italian cooking is regional. This cookbook gives you a chance to ""taste"" Parma. The food of Parma, as presented in this cookbook, is rich and diverse. The recipes are generally easy to follow and use ingredients easily obtained by the USA cook.I did find lapses in several recipes where a certain step or procedure was assumed (or was it unintentionally omitted?). The recipes I have done have been successful and flavorful.I love cookbooks that give you more than just recipes: they teach you about cooking, culture, and people. While this is not as good as some of the best regional cookbooks, it is certainly does teach about the cuisine and culture of Parma (and a bit about the USA where the author lives). It is a worthy addition to the regional cookbook genre."
4,wonderful dishes of traditional northern italian cuisine,"This cookbook has many unique meals of northern Italy nicely written with recollections of ""la familigia"" and traditional italian meals. The dishes take some extra care and time, but isn't great italian food worth that?"
5,Surprising how simple & easy everything was to prepare!!!,"I'm an Italian and this brought home all the wonderful aroama's & flavors I was brought up on, but never had I known how easy it was to prepare until, after buying this book, I found the reasons why my parents served Italian food almost daily in our household. Thank you Chef Ricci!!!"
5,As real as it gets,This book brings to life many of the peasant delicasies that my grandmother used to make.Published recipes for different varieties of Torta and even Anolini en Brodo! Who knew? There are even gems that I was not familiar with like Braised Fennel (delicious).The anecdotes were alo very enjoyable to me having grown up in the Bronx near Conti's Bakery mentioned in the Forward.An excellent reference.
4,A Nice Book On Northern Italian Cuisine,"Having lived in Italy for 8 years myself, I learned to fully appreciate the foods of Emilia-Romagna, the region in which Parma sits. This book spolights the foods of Parma, famous for it's Parmigiano and Prosciutto di Parma. The book is well layed out, the recipes simple to prepare, and the food photos particularly inspiring. As the host of my own culinary website Italian Food Forever, I am always interested in learning more about regional Italian cuisine, and found this book pasrticularly enjoyable."
1,Be careful before ordering,"I ordered 2 boxes on Oct 26. They are currently scheduled for delivery on Jan 17, after being rescheduled twice. Do not believe the 3-5 week delivery estimate."
1,Subtext: Not Gibbon's Text,"This a masterful display of Pocock's ability to marshal the minutia of history over and against the History under discussion - judging great works by a morass of trivia. The difficulty with such a discussion of Gibbon is its ability to tyrannize the reader's perception of a work by appealing to such a vast amount of data. There is no doubt Pocock may be correct concerning every single point, but one cannot know on his authority alone.The book has scholarly merit, but it should be the last thing on anyone's list who wants to understand Gibbon on Gibbon's own terms."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased this book for the $3.49 price. To my surprise, it really is 4 pages, small pages, and the list price on the book is $1.50. There are about 24 small stickers, the size of a quarter. Save your money, it's not worth the cost of the book plus shipping."
1,Rip Off,I've never been more disappointed in something I ordered from Amazon. Tiny four page book with just stickers; no activities even suggested much less included. Marked on the back for $1.50 not $3.49. Don't buy!
4,Detailed but not through,"If you already get the big picture about blues, jazz, or are a listener, this is a good book to read to gain an even more intricate knowledge about the history, development, and sentiment of blues and jazz in America. If you are a total blues or jazz noobie, this book is not very through and tends to focus on more detailed subjects, you might find yourself lost, or juggling with different genres, time periods, and people. Personally, after reading this book, I saw a side of blues that I never knew and thus am more careful about what I call blues, or jazz. Since the book was written around the 60's, the book ends about around bebop, or rock n' roll."
3,"NO DEATHS, BUT AWESOME DESTRUCTION","The Grand Forks flood of '97 killed no one, but left an awesome trail of destruction. After the city was flooded, fire gutted a few of the buildings downtown. Despite being surrounded by water, firefighters could do little to save the structures. This book gives no analysis and is intended to show readers the flood through dramatic color photos. As expected, many of the pictures are moving and are certain to have an effect on anyone who lived through the mess."
1,A book with little details,"This book is almost worthless. There are no detailed descriptions of any installation methods. There are no illustrations. Basically, this book is a trivial overview of the installation of ceramic and stone tile countertops."
3,guitar funK,"This is some high intensity, amped up funk from one of the purveyors of the 'downtown' scene, Robert Musso. Marrying his electric guitar to Thomas Chapin's alto sax, the band streams through the ten tracks with minimal effort. In that sense, it's not as challenging as his project Machine Gun (also with Chapin) which is completely improvised but fierce and agressive as hell as brilliantly demonstated onPass The AmmoAlso reccomended is Musso's collaboration with Prof ShehabAtaxiawhich is rooted more in the Laswellian school of dub."
5,The best tape ever,"Since I first bought this series of tapes I have been nothing but satisfied. When most tapes get wet ant get dirty they start to stick and not recoil, but these tapes don't have any trouble. They also go out further than most other tapes which greatly helps when you're trying take measurements up in the air."
2,false publicity,"The tape they send you IS NOT THE CONTRACTOR GRADE that appear in the picture. it is still the Max steel but doesn't have the red rectangle. that indicate is a contractor grade, an make it much durable an better I still keep it because returns take weeks and who has the time ?"
1,Not contractor grade,"Even though the title says contractor grade, this tape is not contractor grade! It is the same one you can buy at the same price at your local hardware store and not have to pay shipping. Do not be fooled like I was."
4,Cute Feel Good Movie...,"This is a sweet movie, although the ending is a bit rushed. Definitely worth watching. After watching this I want to learn how to make ramen too... it made me hungry! lol"
3,The Ramen Girl never quite cooks.,"I had never heard of this movie when I watched late one night on cable. Apparently the movie had been a straight to DVD release.That normally portends a real stinkfest of a film.It is a take on the fish out of water , reactions to new scenarios with elements of The Karate Kid. However the task master in this film is a lot meaner. Most of the main characters can never converse directly since they have no common language. That aside there are a few laughs and the film is worth a watch. The ending was a little disappointing it appeared they ran out of either script, time or money."
3,"""Somewhere along the way I just forgot what I wanted to do with my life...""","The late Brittany Murphy stars in the charming culture-clash romantic comedy of THE RAMEN GIRL (2008). After relocating to Japan and being dumped by her boyfriend, Abby (Murphy) drowns her sorrows at a local Ramen shop. Delighted by the traditional dish of noodles, vegetables and pork, Abby resolves to learn how to cook the meal herself...triggering an hilarious battle of wills with her reluctant ""sensei"" (Toshiyuki Nishida) in the process!Beautifully filmed on location in Japan, THE RAMEN GIRL is an adorable movie and Ms Murphy does a lovely job in the lead. On the downside, Becca Topol's screenplay is rather disjointed, peppered with too many characters who start off strong but seem to go nowhere (Tammy Blanchard as Gretchan, Daniel Evans as Tom, etc.).Purely for fans of the late great Brittany Murphy, this will always be a must-see, but I'd love for this forgotten film to find an even larger audience. It deserves to."
1,This is really bad,"I'm a Brittany Murphy fan, but this is just horrible, and it is Brittany Murphy at her worst. Just simply terrible, don't say you weren't warned."
2,Horrible,"I love chick flicks! I'm all for the independent girl on a new adventure. I also like Brittany Murphy. It's really disappointing that this movie is horrible. A perky American girl gets stuck in a country where she doesn't speak the language, but don't worry, she has her English-Japanese dictionary with her which really helps her learn Japanese (because the language is that easy). She just so happens to decide to learn how to cook ramen which apparently is a challenging dish (I don't know about you but I boil the water, open the bag, and drop the noodles in...then I add the flavor packet). Anyway, because she makes ramen, she's hailed as a neighborhood hero and everyone LOVES her. The movie shows the Japanese in a negative light while the blonde haired brown eyed beauty is sweet and bubbly and a total hero. Yeah. I couldn't buy it. It's a shame because I really like Brittany Murphy."
1,"Chow, Not so Fun","This movie of an unmotivated girl, love-sick in search of a career in and of itself was a lot to handle. Add to that she doesn't speak the language and wants to learn how to make ramen? I fast-forwarded through most of this and still thought it lagged. Not a recommended movie at all."
3,marginally entertaining,I thought there were redeeming moments but would not have watched this if the selection of prime videos were better.
2,didn't even bother finishing this one,"I was looking for a light movie, but the story is contrived in a way that made me lose interest in the heroine and the story."
3,Not what i had expected...,"This movie is less about the culture and cuisine of Japan but more about Brittany Murphy having an emotional breakdown. It's also censored for language which you may either appreciate or find annoying. I was also disappointed with the film's ending. Abby does not win the master chef's approval when she creates an American fusion dish- ramen made with corn, tomato, and peppers in addition to the traditional ingredients, straying from the traditional recipe. Also you never get to see her wearing a kimono like the cover art suggests."
4,No soup for you,"Ramen Girl follows the familiar pattern of somebody in their mid-20s who is lost in life and finds herself in a foreign country. In this case, the finding is odd. Brittany Murphy's character finds her calling in ramen. In particular, she wants to learn how to cook the perfect bowl of Ramen. She asks a Japanese chef who speaks no English to teacher her, an American who speaks no Japanese, how to make Ramen.The movie was actually pretty funny. It includes frequent scenes of a Ramen master slapping Murphy on the head for being a bad student. It definitely works as a lighthearted date movie. However, overall it did seem a bit chopped up and hasty. It seems as if some key plot developments were skipped over or overlooked. For example, it never is really clear just when Murphy learns how to cook Ramen. Also, throughout the movie, I kept wondering why nobody ever bothered to get a translator who could sort out the mess. Despite this, you'll probably get a few laughs out of their arguments."
3,Its all about the characters in the Ramen shop,"This movie worked for me because of the compelling performance of the Japanese actors in the Ramen shop. The Japanese characters were interesting, humorous and well acted. The lead actress, Brittany Murphy did not seem as natural or convincing in comparison but she gave an acceptable performance. The lead character's ex-pat friends were basically cardboard cut-outs, but they didn't really matter to the story so the movie still worked. It felt like the director could have done a bit more with this movie (made it longer, added more detail), but it would have required much more subtlety from Brittany Murphy. Instead he chose to rush the lead character's development and paint it with primary colors and relied on the Japanese cast to hold up the movie (and they were up to the task). The gem of this film was really the lead Japanese actor, he stole the show and made the whole thing enjoyable to watch."
4,A Treat of a movie,"This movie is a breath of fresh air in this year (decade?) of comic book adaptations and remakes. I'll be brief and share just the high points:- Great acting- Great portrayal of Japanese culture- Great use of the language barrier: I love the fact that it never disappears, yet mutual understanding sets in; I love the realism with which the actors react to each other's speech - in fact I wondered if they improvised and did not in fact know what the other actor was saying.- Good nuance to the main character- They should have showed Abby becoming a ramen chef in more detail- They should have focused on the old chef's story moreAnyway, do yourself a favor and see this movie. I have already seen it twice and will always remember it."
5,Great Movie,"Couldn't find this movie anywhere in stores, so glad I was able to make my parent's day by ordering it! It came within two days and was a great surprise! THANKS"
4,Funny,"Amusing story starring one of my favorites, Brittany Murphy. Simple story but enough to keep you entertained.The constant talk and visuals of ramen will make you hungry."
5,Food and life,"If you enjoy films like god of cookery and eat,drink,man, woman, this film belongs in your collection. Probably one of Murphy's best films. Great ending"
2,Pass the Parody Please,"Frankly the only way I could begin to appreciate this movie even a little was to view it as parody. Ditzy Brittany as a ""seeker"" in Tokyo? Puhleaze. But once you put that ditz with the phony lips who refuses to learn even a little Japanese in with the drunken ramen ""master"" and climax it with that masterful portrayal of a very tired, seemingly blotto ramen ""grandmaster"" the movie has some laughs, for me at least. (Meanwhile, next to me in bed, my Murphy-loving girlfriend was eating it all up as straight ""drama."" Sigh.) Ditzy Brittany should have stayed with her Tokyo copyediting job, which apparently consisted primarily of editing bathroom signs, changing ""flash"" to ""flush,"" which is a telling inside joke about the two pejorative ways to view this silly movie."
5,I didn't expect this movie to be so awesome.,"Inspiring, heartwarming and funny as heck, this movie completely surprised me. I laughed, cried and had a thoroughly great time. A real must see."
3,Cry Baby,"As a ramen maniac, I like delving into the subject through many different media. Although the story in this movie was fairly strong, I would have to catagorize this as a ""chick-flick"". It seemed like the girl was crying about something or other every 10 minutes throughout the film. On the whole it was OK, so I will probably keep it around for a while, but Tampopo was better."
3,Another author who is prejudice against Baptist beginnings,"the book was very detailed, but prejudical against Baptists throughout history.According to McBeth no one held to Baptist's beliefs until the 16th century? Baptism by immersion and faith and Jesus was held for many centuries before this."
1,Two Cartridges?,I purchased this a month or two back and was only able to give it my son in the last few days. The entire reason i bought it was to get 6 games on one cartridge. I could've found the two cartridges at cheaper prices not to mention that I probably would'nt have bought my son the connect four cartridge (which he still has not yet played) if the description had been accurate. I'm not happy.
4,Triumph of the Small Press?,"Mr. Tilston's well researched and competently written book is published by a small press, probably a subisidy publisher. The real question is not how good the book is, but whether established publishers like Harper Collins, Bantam or Simon Schuster would have published it.Are we losing out on good writers and good books because money making has become the name of the game?Perhaps Mr. Tilston can answer my question. Is he satisfied with the way the book is published? Has he recouped his investment or a well caressed ego is worth the outlay?I'll be interested in hearing from him. He certainly has the flair of the language, hall mark of a real writer."
3,3 stars.,"a lot of fine folks love this album, critic and non-critic alike, so don't let me drive you away, but i've tried getting into this album more than a few times over the years, and i made another attempt yesterday, and it's just not working for me. i am not one who automatically dislikes slick polished production on an album, but with this group i just don't feel it works. i love the raw power of their 1st album, and ditto the live set ""full house,"" this turn toward the mainstream forsakes those blues-rocker days in favor of funk, ballads, shuffles, and arena rock. i want to love it. i just don't. the title track ""monkey island,"" is fine, nothing much else here strikes me so. very professional sounding, very uninspiring. mediocre material from a band that did much better elsewhere. sorry."
5,A remarkable study of country code domain names...,"""Addressing The World embarks on a less traveled but more meaningful journey of an in-depth look into country code domain extensions. The authors successfully show a correlation between the domain name and its culture, from both the real world and cyberspace perspectives. Addressing The World is a must read for anyone interested in learning about the origins of domain names and the purpose behind them."""
4,A quick read!,"Although the main characters are not quite sympathetic due to their arrogance and the whole book was a bit licentious, I enjoyed being in J. C. Kaminer's head anyway and couldn't put it down, which was not a problem because it was a quick read.I'm such a fan of Michael Moriarty that I might be biased, but I don't think so.I have a question: On page 86, there was a revelation foreshadowed, but after putting down the book I couldn't figure out what it was."
2,look elsewhere for learning Belly dance,"Like many I too bought this set and it was a waste of money. I have had real classes but am still a beginner. This DVD will not help you learn much. Her emphsis on Goddess is rather enoying and I am one that follows that path. You are much better off buying one of Azia's, Keti's or Neon's DVDs. If you want a whole course look up Habiba Quick Start to Belly Dance. You will find it on her site. Or get from here any others but Dolphina."
4,"Cheesy, but good!","Dolphina can be a bit much, but that enthusiasm translates into a good bellydance workout! I like that she builds up the difficulty, so you can increase the challenge at your own pace. Some of the camera work isn't helpful (like not being able to see her feet sometimes, or not being able to see what she's moving and how) - but those moments are rare.I'm happy to take some over-emphasized enthusiasm about kundalini or the sacredness of bellydance in order to have an instructor who can break it all down to the basics, who also manages to build confidence through the TV screen. You go, Dolphina!"
3,Exercise your mind,"In the introduction to this puzzle book, the editors of Smart Games, Inc. say that when it comes to your mental acuity, you must use it or lose it. This collection of word puzzles is intended to help you with your mental exercises. There are four types of puzzles in the collection:- Scramblegrams, where you unscramble words in themed sets- Word melt, which is a word ladder where you replace one or two letters at a time to change from the starting word to the ending word- Word blocks, where you arrange 2 letter blocks to form letters, using each block only once- Word hunt, which is a word search grid where you locate themed words hidden in any direction in the grid, including in a snaking pathThe puzzles range from easy to hard. There's not much variety here compared to other word puzzle books, though, so I give it only 3 stars. The book is spiral bound to lie flat while you solve. A CD ROM is included with bonus word puzzles to solve.Eileen Rieback"
2,Not really for our rats (though it doesn't claim so...),"Great toy, maybe, for ferrets. My three rats still have little interest (got it as another reviewer said her rats liked it).One negative, it came smushed up in a package. We've had it out about a month and the smashed foam head still has not returned to the shape that it is actually intended to have...Maybe worth a try for ferrets as indended...(but that doesn't necessarily fix the squished head)."
5,Great ferret bed,"My ferrets have one of these in their cage and it is their bed of choice despite having a variety of other options. Its great because it allows them a place to hide, yet it also props itself up and open so its not like they cant breahe or see out of it. Thus far it has stood up to repeated washings, which pleases me the most."
5,Rats Love it!,"I bought this for my rats and they love it. They run around and play in the arms and then cuddle up for a nap inside the octopuss' head. Some of the rittens like to try to climb to the top. Anyway, fun for all!"
2,An uneven album at best.,"When I think back to what Yes was and then I hear this album, I shake my head in disbelief. Only ""Tales"" ""Tormato"" and ""Relayer"" are worse. The songs really don't have that Yes sound. Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn couldn't do much with their former band The Buggles and they don't add much here. This band should have called it quits after ""Going For The One"" but they didn't and this is what you get. Subtract Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman and you get what I consider a fake Yes album. Get this only to complete your collection. DO NOT START HERE!"
1,Sugary coated garbage,"You have to admit that most bands that put out a record that can last over 10 years (at the time) are somewhere along the line going to put out a record that is just plain garbage. Drama for Yes was just that. Trevor was smart enough not to do another album with them...thank God. Very few producers for mainstream records make good singers who have ""feel"" in their music. I think he(Trevor) looked at what was marketable and went for it neverminding the music. Drama is pure proof of that. There's only two good things about that record. The cover art (Roger Dean never disappoints) and Squire's bass work. Other than that, Drama sucks. Ranks right up there with Backstreet Boys' Melaluminum or Millenium...whatever. Do not buy this record if you just heard one song by Yes. Go for Close to the Edge or 90125."
2,The worst Yes album,"Drama was and remains a big disappointment. Quite beyond the inferior vocals of Trevor Horn is the appalling lack of good material. This album sticks out like a sore thumb in the Yes catalogue. Apart from "" Tempus Fugit"", The songs lack compositional quality and lyrical strength. I found ""Machine Messiah"" almost unlistenable. Save your money or buy Jon Anderson's ""Song of Seven"" instead."
2,utter rubbish,"There are bits of songs that actually sound good, but you have to dig into the songs deeply to find them. Into the Lens has got to be one of the worst songs ever written. Just completely awful. This cd hurts my ears, and to date, I still haven't been able to listen to it all the way through, which is a shame because this is the only one of their cds that affects me this negatively. Save your money."
1,made me laugh but wasn't supposed to,"This album cracked me up. I stopped buying YES an album or two before this was originally released. Thought I'd see what I missed way back then. What a hoot! It sounds like a STYX tribute band! That ""camera camera"" tune was side-splitting but I'm sure it wasn't supposed to be hilarious. Greasy kids' stuff I tells ya! They say you can never go home. Sometimes you should not even try. What a riot!"
2,Completely forgettable but for tracks 13 to 16,"The line up here should have just called themselves DRAMA. As Yes, this was a failure, the one listenable track being essentially a Jon Anderson knock off. The songs don't hold up well, and really apart from tracks 13 thru 16, which show you where Anderson might have taken the band, there is little point in this CD. Squire and Howe are not strong enough on their own to carry YES forward. It was good that Wakeman was out and Downes and Horn do their best, but they were essentially standing in. That role suited neither of them. Downes went on to ASIA, Horn went to the control room.Back then, it was generally assumed YES was dead in the water. Thankfully, Squire and White found Rabin and Kaye. Out of the ashes of DRAMA came 90125."
1,no stars is more appropiate,"After listeneing to Yes for over 36 years, there are two individuals that are a must Jon Anderson and Chris Squire. Steve Howe also falls into this category however he was not an original Yes member.Any cd without Jon Anderson vocals is as absurd as Paul Rodgers singing for Queen.Anderson is more than just a vocalist he is the primary source of their lyrics.Thank God that this lineup of Yes didn't last or maybe the public was just telling them you are not Yes without Jon."
1,Sometimes Less Is More,"""Rhino should have released the bonus tracks in a separate package and left all these classic early Yes albums the way they were meant to be.""That was my original review of this edition of ""Drama"" and I stand by it.But now I must add this -I don't know why the reviewer who calls himself ""man-at-work437"" felt the need to insult me.I am merely expressing my opinion, and I believe I am being quite diplomatic about it.It would be nice if every reviewer were to include an email address in their profile.I'd like to thank the reviewer known as ""myxoplik"" personally for their kind words of support."
4,One of the best Yes albums.,"I grew up with Yes. Rick Wakeman, Jon Anderson, Squire, Howe, Buford and White. I loved the early albums, but the band was growing stale. They had released the lackluster Tormato, which seemed like the death knoll of this band.When I heard that Yes was joining forces with ""The Buggles"", and without Anderson, to say I was skeptical would have been an understatement. Much to my supprise this was, and still is, one of my favorite albums. Tempus Fugit, Run Through the Light & Into the Lens breathed a new spark into my old favorite band and made them seem new and exciting again. Although this lineup didn't last (although they evolved into Asia), the spirit of this release lived on in 90125's Owner of a Lonely Heart."
3,"As long as you have squire and howe, you have yes!","I am by no means downsizing andersons role in yes, but at the end of the day the backbone and driving force of yes has always been howe and squire. Trevor horn also sounds alot like anderson so its not like this yes sounds radically different. The album itself is pretty solid while not reaching the heights of there earlier recordings its still a hell of alot better than tormato! Best track on the album is tempus fugit, actually its one of the best yes songs of all time. I like some parts of through the lens but after a while the line ""I am a camera"" gets really annoying. Its at times like this they could have really used andersons input. If your a huge yes fan this is a must have."
3,no jon anderson. uh oh!,"actually not that bad. and you still got chris squire. give it a try,i think you will be pleasantly surprised."
1,What the heck?,"I love the music on this CD. However, for some reason, when I try to play this CD, I get about as much static as I do music.It's just simply got to be a manufacturing problem. what an absolute waste of time. enough said."
4,Chris Squire's Yes,"Chris turns his bass up to 11 (not a bad thing) and so what you get is a group that might remind you of Yes, some interesting lyrics, well constructed melodies, top notch musicians and a very enjoyable listen."
2,"Years Later, Its Still ""So So"" Than Yes","I remember and still have the vinyl album when it came out. The first cut I heard was 'Tempis Fugit'. Knowing the ""buggling"" addition to the group, I was strapped in for a ride of sorts. The above cut and 'Does It Really Happen' are the best on the CD. The rest is just dribble. A star for each!"
1,The death knell for Yes.,"This was the first in a long line of weak efforts for Yes. Without Anderson on vocals they end up sounding like a good Yes cover band. Compositions are weak, lyrics trite, and performances uninspired. Go to their 70's output or even to the Keys to Ascension recordings, a noble but sub-par effort. Pass this one over...Simon"
2,It is truly a Drama,"Unfortunately 80s were not good times for Yes at all and this record is the beginning of te downfall period... In this album there are only two good things: the cover by Roger Dean and the first song Machine Messiah... this is it, the rest is just the average rock music, where such great musicians as Chris Squire and Steve Howe played (didn't help a lot either). The absence of Jon Anderson was a great blow of course, so it is not a surprise that the album was not successful... the songs are boring and too long, a very great dissapointment after Going for the One and Tormato...P.S. I forgot the bonuses, which are rather good... it s interesting to listen to the last tracks what may have come out of Yes if Anderson and Wakeman stayed..."
3,not that bad of an album,"Despite the fact that Trevor Horn had the unenviable task of following in Jon Anderson's footsteps, this isn't really that bad of an album, and it's probably unfairly singled out as a bad album by some Yes fans just because Anderson isn't singing on it. There really isn't a bad track, and the former Buggles (Horn and Downes) did an admirable job of replacing Anderson and Wakeman. The best tracks are Machine Messiah, Does It Really Happen, and Tempest Fugit. Give it a listen without having any preconceived notions about it."
4,Underappreciated Curio,"This is the album without Jon. Heresy!Looking at this as a separate band, however, this is one fabulous album.There are no real duds on this album, although sometimes ""Does it Really Happen"" comes too close to a funk/disco hybrid that doesn't sit all that comfortably.""Machine Messiah"", ""Into The Lens"" and especially ""Tempus Fugit"" are very strong. Jon Anderson has expressed that he would not be adverse to singing ""Tempus Fugit"" live. Heck, I think they should rerecord this song and issue as a single. It is that good!This album is certainly heavier than ""Tormato"" and is very well produced (thanks to Trevor Horn I am sure) and the songs are focused. I'm not horribly fond of Trevor Horn's voice though, maybe it is being pitched too high in order to sound like....No Jon?Heresy."
4,"I'll take it over ""Tormato"" or ""Union"" any day!","A much better recording than many fans and critics thought. Lots of off-time arrangements and extended workouts. The additions of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes work surprisingly well, and for anybody whining about the lyics, they're no more obscure than anything Jon Anderson's ever written."
3,a cool show,"This is a pretty good album; Machine Messiah, in particular, measures up to anything from the Anderson/Wakeman canon.The show backing this album was really cool, though. It was ""in the round"" and Machine Messiah and Into the Lens worked well live; a highlight was And You and I played in the original arrangement, complete with the acoustic guitar. Very nice!"
4,Underrated.,"This first non-Jon Anderson YES album is very much a pre-cursor to 90125. Compared to its 1978 predecessor Tormato, this one rocks with a vengeance. Pacific Microsonics in Japan have brought out much greater clarity and dynamics in this 2001 HDCD remaster, like never before. It's a great improvement on the early 90's U.S. remastered CDs. The miniature gatefold LP jacket and artwork is just gorgeous."
3,Bright spots redeem rest,"I must respectfully disagree with other reviewers, but I do think that the bright spots make up for the weak ones. Those bright spots are the classic Tempus Fugit and Can It Really Happen. Machine Messiah has some great moments but is far too long. The others are throwaways. But get it for Fugit!"
3,Enjoyable and Lively,"I enjoy Drama. I thought Trevor Horn did a fine job taking Jon's place. Trevor Horn sounds similar enough. ""Machine Messiah"" is interesting. ""Does it Really Happen"" has a cool intro bass line courtesy of bass great Chris Squire and cool keyboards from the fantastic keyboardist Geoff Downes. ""Into the Lenses"" is cool too. The best song would have to be ""Tempus Fugit"". The vocals are cool how they are put together. And you can't beat the bassline. That's a standout. Underrated, but still a good album and worth a listen."
1,"Great album, but...","... you know that keyboard fade-in that kicks off track 3's rideout? Well, when this track was remastered, the fade-in was not preserved. Keyboards just kick in at full volume, thus ruining the intended gradual build up to the bass-driven rideout. Other than this oversight, which knocks my rating of this edition to 1 star, the musical experience of Drama remains among my favorite of Yes. Keep the Atlantic remaster if you've got it, or get this if you can tolerate the remastering error. P.S., bonus tracks are inconsequential IMHO. The Anderson tracks underscore the fact that Yes was due for a change in musical direction. Enter the Buggles..."
4,Big Bud Late Night Blues Drum and Bass,"Yep, in case you missed their last realease ""infinfity + infinity"", which I highly recomend as well as this release. This is a very clean and cerebreal approach to drum and bass. They know how to do it and they do it well. The first disc is MCed, not a favorite of mine, but it does not detract much from the great tunes. I personally dont like tracks MCed over but that is just me. I think Big Bud are the best thing coming from Good Looking records, just wish I had bought this one from Amazon as I nearly spent double here in Japan. If you get this one you wont regret it, also try out there other release."
4,Big Bud - Late Night Blues,"The first disc of Big Bud's second album, Late Night Blues picks up where Infinity + Infinity leaves off: in downtempo-land. ""On the Six"" picks up a 6/8 tempo, but retains the jazziness, while ""Baby"" reintroduces some of the atmospherics that marked Big Bud's earlier work. While ""Mombassa"" adds some African chanting, ""Sacha's Song"" goes for straight-up deep house. ""Soulfood"" finally gets back to the drum `n' bass we've been waiting for, and it's worth the wait for the jazzy juiciness. ""Persian Blues"" doesn't sound very Persian, but it does have some nice breaks. The second disc is more of the atmospheric drum `n' bass for which Big Bud is known, but given the development of his sound that was demonstrated on the first disc, it's not quite as exciting as it should be. It's still cracking drum `n' bass, though, so don't miss out."
2,Duller & Dull,"2 1/2The first disc feels of mostly generic downbeat house, with a bit of generic upbeat d&b;, besides for some mildly sleek and exotic production which occasionally distinguishes the material from complete obscurity. It's a good thing the second disc flows way better and is slightly more stimulating, containing just enough piloted zest to make the release bearable for anyone not inside the drum and bass scene."
4,BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,"I'm a huge Bette Davis fan but definately not blind to her bad movies.I think she's horrible in The Star, pointless in Mr. Skeffington and wasted in June Bride and boring in A Stolen Life. Having said that she's quite good in this film and not too mannered. Nice to have religion thrown in the mix and forgiveness. I didn't like this movie when I was younger because it is so talky but as an older adult I can now appreciate the themes. And fashion being my primary love...well, the clothes are quite nice and I don't think the movie said who designed them.Oh, and a quirky note. I think Bette is GREAT in Beyond the Forest----and I don't mean campy great either. I thought her anger and frustration were dead on."
1,Where's the variety and options???,"Here we are in the 21st century and I can barely find a wireless doorbell system that offers more than one AC-powered multiple doorbell. I don't need more than one doorbell button, but I DO need more than one doorbell. I may be in the far end of the house, away from the main doorbell. I need more than one doorbell! I'm mighty disappointed."
5,Worth owning,"Each to their own, but I feel this is the best Roy Buchanan CD available. There are no weak tracks on this and the version of 'The Messiah Will Come Again' is better here. Some blues fans would be upset purely on the basis it tends to be more of a pop than blues CD. Probably not for those with blinkered music tastes, but definitely for those who like a variety of music."
2,PLEASE HELP ME !,"I play and play again and again and always the same race? How can I advance in the game.................My child is boring about it, all the time is the same thing."
2,Racing Game? Not....The game is boring.,"I bought the game expecting a racing game, and I got this little, cheesy, boring game filled with little mini games that use the stylus. I spoke to someone who had the PS2 version, and I think this version (DS) is different from the console version. I have played through the first 3 mini games, and they are really boring. NO Racing. My son was disappointed that you can't even play any of the main characters in the game (yet). There's a boring mini game with ""Snot rocket"", and a ""Simon-like"" game where you match the colors blinking on a stop light, and a game where you go fill up gas tanks as fast as you can. Truly not a good game. Pick up Mario Cart if you want a good DS racing game."
2,it's it not worth it...,"Hi, we purchased this game along with the Mario Bros for my 6yrs old Son, for Christmas, and he's dissapointed witht he Cars game, it's really boring for kids...I just read the top review where it says you can unlock more games...we will try that, maybe that makes the purchase worth... I think a movie like cars, so beautiful, could have ended up in a more interesting game, that Kids would really love and want to play..."
2,"boring, get the ""Cars: Mater-National"" instead","This might be an ok for a kid under 6. But it was pretty boring none the less and a waste of time and money for the rest. It's not an actual race game or anything, it's just a hit the right spot on the screen at the right moments type of thing.If you think it's going to be one of those racing games where one button is accelerate, ones break, and then steer them around the track, then you will be sorely mistaken. If thats what you are after, try ""Cars: Mater-National"" as that is what you'd think these games would be, and the type of games found on this version im reviewing here should be side mini/games on the ""Cars: Mater-National"" version."
2,The movie es better,"I bought this game for my son who is a Cars fan, but I notice that he plays only for 15 minutes when he goes and changes for another game.If you like a Car o racing game better buy MarioKart"
2,Terrible game,"I bought this game for my son (6yrs), after watching the video review on Amazon. The actual game, at least the DS Lite version, is not what you see on the video review. Unfortunately, this is not a typical racing game. Most of the challenges have nothing to do with racing. Plus you have to use your stylus to play it. If you're looking for a good racing game, do not buy this. Its a waste."
2,BOOOOOORRRRING,"Simply put, this game is disappointing. Don't waste your money, buy a different racing game instead. MarioKart (which allows online play) is better"
5,excelent,"excelente producto, muy buena calidad, y profesional en la atencion,me encanto el producto, recomiento este producto ampliamente, satisfaccion total. recomiendo esta tienda completamente"
1,Booorriinnnnng!!!!,"I should have read the reviews before I got this game. It is very boring. I got it for my 4 year old. They played it for ten minutes then put it down. It's just been sitting here. I guess it depends on your child's interest, but I can tell you mine just did not like this one at all. They are not hard to please either. Try another game. This is not a racing game at all. Being that it's a cars game, I thought that's what I was buying. I ended up buying the sonic all star racing game. It's ok"
3,need patience,"there are only 3 mini games to start with, gets boring quick. The racing game is not much fun."
1,Boooorrrrring,"Hate this game. Purchased it for my eight-year-old son, and he hates it. At first, I thought he just wasn't finding all the play choices, but I tried it out myself, and it is, indeed, boring. Horrible, actually, unless you think washing cars and matching red-light patterns is fun and challenging. Can't really return it, as fault was not the seller's. So we are stuck with this boring $19 game that we will have to try to trade for way less than we paid for it. Would recommend for a five-year-old, at the most."
2,It's not what I expected :(,"I was a little bummed out when I first played this game, because I thought it was going to be a lot more fun than it it is. There are only 3 things you can do and all of them are way to easy. Even for the 6 year old who I bought it for isn't impressed."
5,What Soul Brothers can do for you,A Great Book with loads of ideas to follow today that were introduced by these 12 great brothers from scripture. You can read it all at once or take one brother each day for two weeks. It is well worht the time of any one but helpful to very busy brothers today! When you finish reading Fr. Rohr's book you will know twelve brothers from Scripture in a very intimate fashion. Read it! You won't be sorry!fr. Hank
3,OK book,"A draft of this book was assigned in my ancient chinese history class 2 years ago, so I don't know how much it has changed since then, but the book was a fairly straightforward (and very condensed) account of the first 2000+ years of Chinese history. It pays particular attention to the Han, Tang, and Sung periods, and its main focus is trying to portray China as a vibrant and open society, with many different ethnic groups, religions, languages and travelers, which was pretty interesting considering most other texts on China always inevitable treat it as a enigma and something mysterious and difficult to understand. Other than that, there's nothing really shocking about it. It's a pretty decent textbook account of Chinese history up to 1600 - after that, go to Jonathan Spence."
3,not my favorate history book,"this book emphasizes more on the Chinese culture instead of the history itself. For someone who doesn't know Chinese history at all, it's hard to try to read culture and history at the same time."
4,A great scent for younger women,"My little sisters turned me on to Sensi- they're both loyal devotees. I tend to prefer sweet scents- vanilla, Tresor, pink grapefruit, etc. Sensi is one step more grown-up than those- it goes on a bit ""perfume-y,"" the scent can seem strong, but it fades very nicely after ten minutes or so into a delicate, gentle scent that doesn't overpower everything else in the room. I usually have a hard time getting perfume and cologne to last, but the Sensi lingers nicely- today I can still pick up a little bit from this morning ten hours later."
4,great sake set,"The sake set I purchased as a wedding gift for a friend was great. It arrived in a timely fashion and in a very attractive black box. I probably didn't even have to wrap it, the box was so cute. I showed it to a few people at work before I gave it to her and some came back to ask where I got it so they could get one. My only complaint is that it was not as green as it was in the picture...it was more of a blue-green. It was still very beautiful but I ordered green because it is the bride's favorite color as well as one of her wedding colors. She's very happy with it though, so all is well."
5,great,I saw this on channel pbs for a lot of money. I was there that rainy day and was so happy to have this. quality very good.
4,Finally!,"Even though I was and still excited that this concert has finally been released, I am a little disappointed that it truly wasn't EVERYTHING. I had the honor of being at the first rained out show and remember her singing other songs (Mirror-Mirror) that somehow didn't make it to the DVD. I remember the song specifically because of the lighting during the bridge that my cousin and I went crazy for. Other than that I did enjoy this DVD and seeing the full concert the next day that I was unable to attend. Since it was filmed ""back in the day"" you can't really fault them for not adding more content, news clippings and interviews etc. That would've truly been a walk down memory lane. it's still worth the price to have in your library, especially if you were there and experienced it first hand."
5,Diana Reigns Supreme,"I chose the rating of 5 stars because this DVD brought back memories for me from when I myself fought my way through all of those thousands of people to see The Boss Ms. Ross. This was a memorable concert that Diana put all of her heart and soul into for the world to see, and feel. You can clearly see that Diana was very emotional herself when doing this show, and even though it was rained out on the first day she returned as promised to give a full show. I myself was there for both events, and can say that each day was a joy. On that first day as the rains poured down, Ms Ross controlled the crowd while standing in the torrential rains and I've never seen someone become more beautiful the wetter they became. It was surreal as she stood center stage, and looked as if she were a sorceress controlling the elements. All I can say is that if you weren't there, you've got to see it to appreciate it. You'll then understand more just who is The Boss."
3,Disappointed...,"Waited all these years and I got exactly what I assumed I would get. Thankful to have a copy on DVD, but was hoping for all the footage. Yes, all. What? Didn't know there was more? Don't remember more? Whomever Shout Factory purchased or licensed this video from, whether it was Anaid, Showtime, or the diva herself; this is the re-broadcast edit. Showtime had edited Friday's concert to add previous day's footage, in order to fit a two hour time slot. I remember the entire show because it was a milestone. Not to mention, I recorded the entire original live airing. There is at least 15 minutes missing including, ""Pieces of Ice"". Which was my favorite performance of the whole show! Therefore, I give it three stars for DVD release, a huge moment in history, and Ms. Ross' unforgettable energy and ability to keep her promise."
3,Not the spectacle I expected!,"I was searching for a good live dvd of Diana Ross. She had a concert in the Netherlands in 2010. Unfortunately the concert was not registered on DVD as a result of the bancrupcy of the organisation. The dvd is good in sound and picture, but it is very nineties! No grand stageworks, but a simple concert. Nowadays the artists perform their songs at live concerts with the same punctuality as a studio recording. In the seventies and eighties during the live concerts, the songs would be pitched up, like as twice the speed. I still don't understand why. Also with this concert, that is the case...Upside down, twice as fast is not nice...So overall enjoyable to see a skinny Diana Ross singing, but no spectacular concert. I hope she will make one before she's too old!!"
5,WHAT A CONCERT!!!,My husband and I went to this concert after work (I worked on 57th and Park) and remember it like it was yesterday. Can't wait to get the DVD (I wish it were on BluRay!!!) and relive it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Tired.,I've only been in love with a few of Diana's songs mostly from the supreme era. When solo she seemed to be focused more on primpin' posin' that I very soon lost interested. She talked and shouted to the crowd and did little singing. When singing it was half assed. I hated this DVD. I'd never seen it before and bought it for my partners enjoyment. I now wish my eyes never had.
3,it is all about Diana Ross,Musically it is not up to today's DVD concert standards but it is a record of a true diva. Even the incredible tight clothing she wears and she is not so young. It was fun to watch but musically did not deliver. probably a one time watch for me
1,For diehards only.,"I thought this was the worst concert I have ever seen by Ross. The only reason there was so much hype was because she stayed during the storm so the crowd would leave peacefully and she came back the next day. Kudo's. Some of the songs seemed out of place, (""Maniac""?) and she's not much of a dancer as it appeared she threw in a quick class for this show. Other than her almost falling off the stage, not much to see here. If you want to see a ""show"" with Diana, look for Live at Caesar's Palace HBO special from around 1979. THAT was a show!"
5,Concert Review,Good quality concert on both the 1st night (when it poured) as well as the 2nd night and come interesting comments from the director. Ross was at her height then and handled the crowd very well. Sort of dramatic and very entertaining.
5,Fantastic,This is a great concert. Diana was wonderful! You would really respect how she was willing to sing in the rain and how she calmed the audience.
1,WHY,"I read plently of ""street life"" books, but this one I must say was the worest! I don't even remember half the names and the book. However I did like the ending of the book, however dumb it was."
1,Never received,"I can't give a review of this book, as it never arrived at it's destination. I contacted the vendor and was told that they would look into it but I never heard from them again. Contacting the post office was also of no help. So I threw my money away on this one."
3,what a disappointment!!!,"I installed my x-fi platinum yesterday and i still can't get over the fact how bad the sound in bf2 is. It sounds worse than sb live! i had before. I'm after calling Creative customer support, because i thought that my x-fi is damaged but the guy i talked to told me that they recieved plenty of complaints from other disappointed BF2 fans. DO NOT buy this card if BF2 is your favorite game. I feel like I wasted 185 euro I spent on the x-fi. What a shame!!!"
4,creative blaster X-Fi Platinum,"i have not yet been able to fully play around with all of the feature. but from what i have seen so far is top notch. if your sound is not working, then go into your diagnostic and change your speaker setting. also i reccommend their cable for this sound card. i give it a four because i have not fully tested the product out."
4,Creative X-Fi Platinum,"I was lucky enough to find this audio component with a generous rebate. It outperformed by expectations under Microsoft XP (SP2), however I am having difficulties with the beta drivers from Creative to integrate this component in Windows Vista Home Premium. The console will not execute. Creative will not support tech questions on a beta product. I am at the mercy of Creative until they finish a final driver for the X-Fi Platinum. Great product when it works."
5,Good product to edit audio in your computer.,"I ordered this sound card as a special request from one of my customers, who wanted to upgrade from a ""Soundblaster Live Value"" card. He planned to use this card to edit music and transfer music from analog sources to digital formats, for instance, to produce CD's, MP3 and so on.The card come with several useful accesories, including a full featured remote control, and a front panel which can be mounted inside a 5 1/4 bay. The front panel allows you to accede to the inputs of the sound card without having to go to the back of the computer.The installation was a breeze, and the bundled software is very complete."
2,Another Nvidia chipset owner with problems,"If you own an Nvidia chipset beware. I have a 690i and every day when I'm ready to play some games I have to cross my fingers and hope I have sound. I've tried everything under the sun but just can't get reliable compatibility. I think I'm going to finally throw in the towel and get an Asus Xonar (which are better quality cards anyway). For what it's worth, the sound quality is fantastic when you can get the thing to stop being so buggy!"
5,WOW,"I bought this card because my old SB Live 5.1 card wasnt working with my new 5.1 speakers (center speaker didnt work in games/mp3's) so it just gave me a reason to get it. I love to play games and my g/f loves to play music on my computer. First off let me tell you BF2 is amazing! If you play BF2 get this card ASAP, the first time i shot a sniper rifle I was just shocked! The quality was so nice and it was so crisp, i shot at nothing 10-15 times just to hear the sound... It was amazing, on top of that bf2 ran smoother! Even on old games like counter-strike the upgrade was noticable. Now with music my g/f loves it too, and shes not a computer person. She loves to play with the different settings and LOVES the remote w/the platinum version. It's a little on the expencive side, but it is more than worth it, I LOVE IT!"
5,Great Deal,"Hardware was A breeze to install.took about 20 minuets including the bay.Same for the software, no problems.Sound Quality is much improved over my old live card.In battlefield 2 game play is much improved on my 2.4/radeon 9700 pro/512.Before I would freeze framing during start in rooms, and during game play in intense situations.Now with the X-Fi I have none of that, and the game runs much smoother overall. Dvd movies sound much improved. Music is also much improved. The only problem Ive had burning expanded mp3's is 1 didnt convert well out of 5 so far. Software interface is also A bit lack luster, but is functional. Card is worth the price, hopefully upgrades will improve interface."
2,The California Raisins Collection,"The California Raisins specials and cartoon show are finally all on DVD in a two disc set. The first disc has the two claymation specials ""Meet the Raisins"" and Raisins: Sold Out"" along with four California Raisins commercials (including the ones featuring Ray Charles and Micheal Jackson). The second disc has all 13 episodes of the California Raisins animated Saturday morning cartoon series. I would have preferred that they put some of the cartoon episodes on the first disc, so as not to overload the second disc. The audio for the second disc is also not as good the the first disc. Watching with my surround sound system, the speaking voices in the cartoon series only come out of one speaker. This leads to the voices sounding hallow and too soft. Even on my regular tv, the background music is louder than the voice acting. For those wondering, only the two specials have subtitles available."
3,"Its Awesome, Except for the Disc with the Cartoons","The Disc on Introducing and the special concerts is awesome and sounds great.The other disc with the cartoons, has audio issues. I wish i would have sent it back, but my kids love it."
5,Memories,"I am an original fan of Firefall from its first album ""Firefall"" in those days you could only by 8 track or Vinyl records. I lost all my vinyl collection in a fire back in '82. Now thank God for downloads you don't have to buy the entire album just download your favorite. Of all the albums this was tops and so I purchases 1-2-6-7-8-9 and 10. At $6.93 it was great! This to me was a classic album!!"
1,Very Disappointed,I am disappointed not on the manufacturer but rather on the organization/firm that handled the refurbishment of the unit. The refurbished unit was shipped without a critical component and was dirty. It looks like they just took the earlier returned unit and shipped it out again.
4,Another great Yes Album,"I am a big Yes fan, but you can count on me if one cd is poor, I will tell. I am not the kind to give five stars to every cd that a band that I like has done. See my Drama or Tormato review for instance !Going for the One is a great cd, I would say, under-estimated by many.Awaken is one of the best from the band. Unlike many reviewers, I love the three tracks in the middle, Turn of the century offer great melodic guitars and vocals. Parralels is a good rocking song and Wonderoous Stories has a great emotion felt through the music. The opening track, Going for the one is energic and surprising but always good. This is one of the Yes cd that I listen very often. I agree with the one who said that Rhino should have release the bonus tracks on another cd. Also, why they didn't make a release like Close to, Relayer, Fragile or Tales, with a carton cd cover instead of the plastic one ??? Why just this cd is made like this ?"
1,DO NOT NUY THIS MINIATURES,"YES......THESE REPLICAS ARE ALMOST INCREDIBLE... TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE... THE PACKAGING IS EXCELLENT, BUT.....WELL, MY FRAGILE COPY HAS A TERRIBLE ONE CHANNEL MINI DROPOUT IN ROUNDABOUT, ON THE VERY BEGGINING,. THIS IS UNADMISSIBLE FOR A YES FAN THAT PAYS 30 DOLLARS FOR A CD!MY GOING FOR THE ONE DOES TOO, SO MY CLOSE TO THE EDGE REPLICAS. I HAVE CHEKED OUT AND THIS DROPOUTS ARE ALL OVER SEVERAL OF THESE MINIATURES.LITTLE DROPOUTS, BUT FOR THIS PRICE, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT ! I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS STUFF ! YOU BETTER GET THE OLD REMASTERS OR WAIT FOR RHINOYES RE-RELEASES. I HAVE HEARD ROUNDABOUT ON YES' NEW BOX SET AND SOUNDS GREAT, WITHOUT THE DISSAPOINTING SOUND DROPOUTS."
2,Sometimes you can't believe reviewers,"This album was way too highly rated.It was praised for the return of Rick Wakeman to the fold and the success of the album. I found the reviews to be overly optimistic. The album was basically a jam session for Wakeman lovers. As a classic rock album, it sucked."
5,Relive the Memories,"I used to own this album on vinyl. I had forgotten some of the songs on it and forgotten how much work and skill used to be put forth by true musical artists. Songs from Yes, Going For The One, exemplify these artistic skills, and help to flood my memories of what once was, musical genius."
4,One Great Track,"""Awaken"" is prime-grade Yes in the style of Relayer, going for the gusto and dropping serious musical virtuosity on the world. The rest of the album's pretty dispensible though, an attempt at commerciality that sounds a bit Zeppelin-inflected on the title track."
5,Classic Yes for sure,Great album and remastered to perfection but like I have said on other reviews of Yes/Rhino is that the extra tracks are what really thrills me now because you get to hear new material (granted some are not really finished and some are just being fleshed out) from a band in their prime. I like the funkier and less jarring and high pitched (extended) Going For The One track better in some ways than the original finished version.
3,the magic is on the way out,"Most of this record suffers from ""new-age disease"" which tends to render everything sterile. It is easily confused with ""hippy disease"" which was prominently evident on all previous Yes records but is not necessarily fatal--sometimes it even helps (and this is especially true in Yes's case) stretch imaginations into new areas. Yes's attempts to ""rock out"" on ""Going for the One"" and ""Parallels"" are sure signs of the sell-out to come. Still, ""Turn of the Century"" and ""Wondrous Stories"" are great songs balanced right on the edge of the new-age abyss (into which ""Awaken"" falls). To give this record 5 stars would be a disservice to the classic 5 that preceded it."
3,Not a fan of this remaster!,"This one of my favorite Yes albums and I have had the original Atlantic cd and it is way, way, WAY easier on the ears. I bought this remaster and whoa nelly, it's like nails scraping blackboard. It is very clear that it has been remastered in the current fashion: LOTS of compression, and LOUD LOUD LOUD. Google Loudness War if you don't know what I'm talking about. In other words, this cd sounds like it's meant to be ripped straight into mp3s and unto your Ipod. If that's how you listen to the album, then it will sound fine - but if you have any intention of sitting down and listening on a half-way decent stereo you're missing out on a lot. I am not an audiophile/yes snob by any means, I just am able to compare remasters and believe a word of caution is needed for Yes-lovers out there..."
5,Yes' Apex,"This album really illustrates the literal meaning of progressive rock to me. Yes could not have made GOING FOR THE ONE without starting at THE YES ALBUM (1971) and going through RELAYER (1974). And like anything that progresses, one has to reach a ceiling. Musically, the band created the best music of its career, even surpassing CLOSE TO THE EDGE in my view. ""Awaken"" is a piece that nearly attains that fabled ""lost chord"" with its exhiliarating ascension. It actually, musically and lyrically, beats ""Close to the Edge"" at its own game. Even the album's one hit single ""Wonderous Stories"" is powerful. Why ""classic-rock radio"" doesn't play this song more and spare us yet another re-run of ""Roundabout"" (the editted version) and ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" is a mystery. Every song on this album is fantastic. No filler. Not a clinker in the lot. Pity the album came at a time when the punks were whining, and the critics were eating out of their hands, it would have been a major hit."
3,Great music- horrible recording,"I wish to God they would have fixed the awful sound of the recording in the remaster, but they did not. The out takes sound so much better than the main course, letting you know that there is a good recording of this album out there somewhere. I wish someone would care enough to release a remix. I was fooled into thinking this release would sound better. It does not. I love Yes and there are no bigger fans out there than me, but it is just so frustrating to listen to this CD. It is so tinny, harsh and distorted with Chris Squire's bass lost in a fog of low end rumble. There is no cranking this up without hurting yourself."
4,Near the top of the list,"Rick Wakeman's return to the group must have inspired Yes to once again stretch themselves away from their normal roads. The title cut is rock and roll all the way but with Yes' signature wink of the eye attitude to let you know they're never going to play it straight. Steve Howe's guitar work throughout this album is up to his usual high standard. And ""Awaken"" may be the ultimate Yes song. The grandeur of the sound and the way they play with the theme and dance around the downbeat towards the end of the piece is pure genius and a joy to indulge in. Mr. Howe's ending guitar line is absolute beauty. The whole album exudes an excitement for their art, something I began to find missing more and more often in their later offerings."
2,Bad Remaster,I was very disappointed in the re-mastering of this album by George Marino. It was noisy and not up to the professionalism of the recent issued re-mastered Yes albums (of which I now have all). Very disappointing.
5,outstanding and above all reality of this world,"Especially the album ""Going for the one"" is guiding me for I think more than 18 years now, and it has truely lost nothing of the faszination that was so important to me even at the age of seventeen. This music is deeply different to all other kinds of music I know. It has something to do with philosophy and - perhaps only for me - with religion. What the people in former times tried to achieve by building the churches very high (reason: to be nearer to godfather) YES tried with their music. If you concentrate on it, it opens your mind and you loose your actual realistic daily problems. You realise that there is more to this world and to yourself as a human being. This album is a must for everybody with high expectations on music. One sentence to the critic: even if I did not understand every word the critic says, I think that this unqualified person does not understand anything of his job. With this person I could not share anything."
1,Dumbstruck,"I read this book when it was first printed, and I was disappointed. It's one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. (In a word: amateurish.) I couldn't help thinking, ""Shouldn't this book have been edited?"" Typos, and plotholes aside, it just wasn't very good storytelling.I've always enjoyed books on the subject of passing. However where books like ""Life on the Color Line"" and ""The Sweeter the Juice"" are like meteors (sure both are non-fiction, but they're fine examples of storytelling), ""Color Struck"" has the impact of a pebble. It just simply failed to strike me as impressive."
3,"I LOVED this book, it helped me immensely","Mr. Choate should probably be considered a racist, but what white priveliged man early 90s wasn't? But the book gives you such an understanding of US-Japan relations, in an easy to read, fun, and concise way, that it really is hard to pass up. I now listen to lectures and speeches, with a whole new attitude, finally knowing much of the backstory between US-Japan relations that I was unaware of before. Sure, Choate is often one-sided to the point of extremism, but he is also very intellectual and well-informed on the issues too.I certainly recommend this as the first sort of policy/politics book for US-JAPAN relations, just because it is so short, brief, cheap, and easy way to jump into something very complicated and nuanced."
3,Worth watching once....but be warned.,"Overall the film was enjoyable and captured an interesting musical ethos. My big complaint is the fact the Ian Curtis' suicide was handled tastelessly. It didn't make much difference to me that it was Ian Curtis, it could have been anyone; any film that portrayed the factual suicide of an actual person in the way this movie did would turn me off. It didn't ruin the movie but it lowered my opinion of it. I doubt I'd watch the film again."
1,Terrible,What happened??? Mitch used to be great. This disc shows him as self indulgent racist. His is no longer relevant. Don't waste your money.
3,very good for the time it was writen,"writen in 1979, i suppose the world was in a very different place in terms of the feminist dialectic. this book has a very significant focus on christian and judiac tradition, so if you are interested in a more thorough read for our contempory diverse world, you may find more to be desired. however, this book does have some great strengths. the articles that are writen about feminist perspectives on christianity and judiasm are very insightful and well writen. and this book is worth having and reading for ""part 4- creating new traditions"" alone. i do refer to this book from time to time when doing research and find it elequent and inspiring, despite its narrow focus. perhaps a revised edition that includes more diverse contributions from feminists of other major religions like islam, hinduism, and budhism, ect. is long overdue."
4,Useful Tape,"The leverlock function is incredibly handy as well as fast. After using a standard locking tape, I find myself wishing i had my leverlock on hand. The tape itself is not as strong as a Contractor grade Stanley. Other than that, it's a great tape for anyone's toolbox."
1,No more than entertaining,"If you know what GND, ND and polarization filters are, than you already know enough.Nothing more is explained. You just see Adam Barker working and reviewing some of his images.It makes me laugh a bit when I see other reviews saying , ""of the best investments"", ""When you get done you have a clear understanding of how to use filters"" and my favorite ""I had many 'ah ha' moments"". If you really want more understanding see for instance Galen Rowell's Creative Outdoor Photography."
2,Adam's DVD on various filters,"Adam Barker does a wonderful program of making his DVD very user/viewer friendly. I was in a class of his last fall in the beautiful ski mountains of Utah. The colors on the trees were trememdous with brilliant reds, oranges, rust and all the wonderful fall colors you could imagine. To top it all off Adam shared just how to use the various ND filters for that very early morning light. The various polarizers and the list goes on. And again, the way he shared how to get the most out of your camera AND the various Singh Ray filters was super. I would certainly recommend his classes and the DVD for those who are serious about their photography. cheers, jon"
3,Great Help Teaching Kids to Pray,"There is a newer edition of this book available, but it is published in Great Britian, 2001. This book is another in the My First Prayers Series. While this one is very good, I don't think it is as good as Thank You God, another in this series of which I have reviewed. This book focuses most on the people who are important to young children (age 1-3). Family, friends, doctors and nurses, etc. Children are introduced to the idea of wisdom, in a very simple way. While I appreciate this, I don't think they really stayed within the theme of the book. The book focuses on praise, which I like, but the connection between praise and wisdom is lacking. I'm sure that even in a simple manner, the two can be made real for little ones. None the less, I do recommend the book to help you teach your little ones how to pray and praise God for the blessings which they have."
3,Respectful,"This is not a book of scary stories - as it notes in the beginning, none of the tales are intended to disturb your dreams. It is a respectful recounting of the lost military aviators and the places their spirits continue to return to. It's well done, but not necessarily what one expects from a book of ""ghost stories""."
5,Humorous but a little sad,You learn a lot about Truman Capote from this book. There is a lot of insight into the kind of man he was. Reading between the lines however it paints a picture of an unhappy person.
4,"Capote speaks, we listen",An intriguing look at one of America's most respected and shunned literary icons. Probes both his writing as well as the fantastic social life for which the author was famous. A unique portrait that will stand as the difinitive book on Capote.
2,Purpose italian charm,The words on the charm were SO SMALL. i am not very happy paying $12 for this. the words do not stretch on the full area.
3,Wart into Sir Stalwart,"Are there more than two King's Daggers? Maybe, or maybe not.All of the right elements are in this chapter of the saga of the King's Daggers but they just aren't quite as gripping as they were in the first book, ""Sir Stalwart"". I expected more maturation of the characterization of Wart and Emerald but the action seemed to carry them along without any growth of their personalities. Hopefully, ""Sky of Swords"", the newest King's Blades novel will have more of those personality conflicts, arcane battles and wonderful descriptions of swordsmanship that made the other books in this series and sub-series so enthralling. This was a good read but not a great one."
2,book lover.,"It, too was OK. Writer started out OK, but by book two, started to run out of story ideas. By book 3, reeaally out of ideas."
3,A Review by Little Foot,"There are three stories in this chapter book. They are all about a boy named Bertie. The first story is about when Bertie makes friends with his neighbor. The second story is about when Bertie is learning how to play the saxophone. The third story is about when Bertie and his mom go bowling. I am in the second grade and I liked this book because the stories are fun. For example, in the third story Bertie's mom gobbles in the bowling alley. The only reason that I didn't give this book four or five stars is because the stories aren't as fun as others I've read."
3,"EN ""5 DIAS"" FALTO LA INSPIRACION DE AMANDA,","SU VOZ SIGUE INTACTA Y CLARA COMO UN CRISTAL. PERO FALTO SU INSPIRACION NI UNA SOLA DE LAS CANCIONES ESTA ESCRITA POR ELLA.TRES CANCIONES SON DE DIEGO VERDAGUER(SU ESPOSO)PERO NO FUE SUFICIENTE PARA LEVANTAR EL CD QUE SUENA UN POCO COMO MUY POPULAR.CREO QUE AMANDA NOS MAL ACOSTUMBRO CON SU ORIGINALIDAD. Y CUANDO HIZO ""EL ROSTRO DEL AMOR""NOS BRINDO UNA PRODUCCION DE PRIMERA CLASE Y ESQUE ELLA CO-ESCRIBIO LAS CANCIONES DE ""EL ROSTRO...""TALVES SU MEJOR PRODUCCION DESDE SU DEBUT ALBUM.AMANDA SIEMPRE SERA UNA DE LAS VOCES MAS IMPRESIONANTES Y MAS BELLAS EN ESTE MUNDO.LE DESEO LO MEJOR CON ESTE CD PERO POR FAVOR AMANDA EN TU PROXIMO DISCO DEVUELVE NOS TU PRIBILEGIADA INSPIRACION."
2,Not what the picture shows,"My complaint about the tape has more to do with the lack of correct advertising. The tape that one receives is not the Contractor Grade Stanley, but the Chrome PowerLock tape. This is very frustrating to expect one thing and receive another."
5,"stanley 12ft - 1-6"" and broken down to .02"" and after 6"" in .1""","It's very hard to find inch tape masures that are broken down into .1"" and .02"".Very handy for aircraft work when drawings brake it down into hundredths.Like when cutting a bin down to be modify when galley or closet or lavatory is added to an interior. Ploting out structure installation for galley, lavatory etc... when drawings are in hundreths."
1,The item in the picture not what was shipped. Terrible Shipping.,The item we received is not what is pictured on the item description. The shipping was terrible. It took a month to get 10 tapes and it was split into 3 shipments. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE Customer Service. Never again.
4,Best book ever!!!!,I think this is the best book i have ever read. This is the first book that i got home and actually wanted to read it and was eager to keep on reading!It is filled with a lot of suspense and action!It was about how three teenage boys who didnt hve very usefull lives untill they make up a rap band and encounter many problems.This is a great book and i highly recomend it.
3,Gangsta Rap By: Benjamin Zaphaniah,"This was an okay book. If you are into music and your favorite type is rap,hip-hop, and R&B, then this is the perfect book to hold your interest. It's about a fifteen year old kid who got kicked out of school. He is left with out no where to go after he ran away and all he depends on is his music! his dream of bein a famous rapper. This takes place in England and all he has are his four friends who believe in im and two of them want to make a rap band with him and in the end they all achieve their dream."
5,Imagination/Wonder,"I own this book as well and in reading it to my grandaugther it brought memories of when I was young as well as seeing the excitement in her eyes. You have to read this aloud and it was truly a great experience for her. She always want to hear a story. I do believe we have to keep the stories alive in our children, the tones, the simplicity of life....a history."
1,Totally DISSATISFIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The opening diameter is over 2 inches . This product was supposed to be 1.5 inches.The telephone customer service woman promised it would be CORRECT and is WASNT!!!
4,A wonderful book about love and the rest of the world,"This is a book of poetry quite unlike anything available these days. Drawing from a vast range of history, locations and experiences (both literary and physical) Kenneth Koch achieves a brilliant and thorough description of love that remains timeless"
5,lonely but never alone,"great book, if anybody feels alone, this book is a good opportunity to realize how much God cares about us and love us."
1,Avoid this like the plague!,"This DVD is nothing more than a Pro Tools infomercial, and an unbearably pretentious one at that. At $30-$40 it might be worthwhile, but $134?!? It spends a lot of time focusing on basic concepts, while providing little information that will be of value to a professional looking to improve his craft. It promotes over-use of plug-ins and encourages beginners to think that a fully blown Pro Tools HD system is the ONLY way to go.In my opinion, Charles Dye is NOT a mixer that beginning audio engineers should seek to emulate, as he has zero experience with analog techniques or systems other than Pro Tools, his work epitomizes much of what is wrong with today's pop sound, and he is laughed at by old-school engineers."
2,The video effects ruined this dvd,"I was excited about learning more bout mixing using pro tools. Within 10 minutes I was dtarting to get annoyed with all of the video editing effects that was being used a bit too excessively. Also, they would have a different background song playing in between audio editing tips. This video would have been greatly beneficial if it didn't have all of the pointless effects. I'm annoyed and feel like I wasted $100."
5,People should give this more credit.,"Charles Dye has done something here that nobody else has done. He's created a Mixing DVD that talks about concrete mixing concepts, and then talks about more abstract concepts. Yes, it's expensive, but he gives you the tracks to mess with yourself. That is a big deal. Some people say it's overdone and overrated, but in my opinion, he's giving invaluable tips in simple format, to beginners and advanced alike. If you want something less artsy, read an instruction manual. This if for the same type of person that likes Mixerman's ""Zen and the Art of Mixing.""Kudos Charles, thanks for taking time to teach patiently and exposing your secrets."
3,"Poor construction, Inaccurate.","I've had this tape measure for 3 years now. It is used for weekend projects. The measure still looks rather new, because of the low use. However, the tape measure is no longer accurate because the end hook is loose. The hook at the end can shift forward or backward about 1/8"". The hook is not missing any rivets; therefore, it appears that the shifting hook is just the result of poor construction. I though about trying to tighten the rivets, but it would probably just break the blade. I might be able to send it back for warranty repair, but I'll probably just buy a new measure. If you don't care about 1/8"" accuracy then it is a pretty good tape measure. It has good retraction. The blade is stiff. The case is solid."
1,garbage!,"As an electrician,I used this tape measure every workday for pipe installation. Within two months of purchasing this tape...,the blade broke at the 7"" mark. Stanley should have a warranty on this tape..."
4,Tape.,First of all I am a plumber so my tape is used nonstop during the work day and in my opinion this is the best tape measure around. Sure the fatmax is nice for once in a while specific things but the max steel is a far better all around tape.
5,My favorite 25' tape,It's not as fat as a fat max but it's definitely a improvement over the powerlock. Very beefy and it fits nicely in my tool pouch. I sometimes have trouble getting my fat max out of my pouch so I like this one a little better. 9' standout is pretty good.
3,"ok, but I like the Fat Max Better.","I just replaced my countractor's grade tape with A Fat Max, I beat and banged the damn thing all over the place, until it was cut in two by a power saw. it's good, but I prefer the FatMax"
2,Not up to 4 leaf standards.,"This balsamic vinegar is a pale substitute for the Roland Diamond balsamic 4 leaf. Thought I would try the bargain version but very disappointing. It is much thinner in viscosity and has a much more bitter taste. Also, the cork snapped right off when I tried to open it and I had to use a cork screw and transfer it to a different bottle. :("
4,Decent!,"I'm an amateur on a search for a decent sub $40 balsamic. This balsamic seems very nice, has quite a punch, and a moderate acidic after taste. The viscosity is thicker than most I've seen at this price. I'd say the only place this could use moderate improvement is in the sweetness area. It's sweet, but not enough for my taste, makes me wonder what the lower ""leaf"" rating product must rank. Overall I am happy with the purchase and at this price range you cant expect miracles."
5,Great Item,"I purchased this flag to show my support for Denny Hamlin on Sunday's outside my house and at Talladega when I go twice a year. This flag was everything that I hoped it would be. It was shipped very quickly and I was impressed with the quality of the flag. It is very thick and durable, easily noticable that it is of quality construction. I wish other flags were at this price because I would have bought another one. BUY THIS FLAG!"
2,Yawn,"The movie was so clever I really expected the game to be lots of fun and very engaging. It really hasn't held my 7 y o and 4 y o's attention like I had hoped, which is saying a lot since they only get to game once a week! The racing isn't as good as Mario racing, the games and objectives are a bit confusing and not as challenging as they could be."
4,neat,This game has some good sceenery. The user is able to drive all around and does not have to stay on the road. Good game for the younger crowd (Pre-teen and younger).
4,Cars,Favorite game of grand kids. They are 3 and 5 year old. The do not understand the points system in the game. But the noise and bumping are great. Those boys will probablh have lead foots when they get a car. Great fun.
3,Kids Will Really Like This,"I Got This Game Right After It Came Out And It Was My Fav Game For A Long Time. (I Was Around 10-11 Then) I Played It For Hours Every Day For About 2-3 Weeks Then I Finished It. But There Is Loads Of Mini Games And Races To Play Even After You Beat It. Tractor Tipping Is The Most Fun Of Them All And I Even Got My Mom And Dad To Play It And They Hogged It All Day! Now That Im Older I Dont Like It Near As Much But Kids 13 And Under Will Like It Alot. I Still Play Tractor Tipping Some, But Not Much Else Now. However Going For A Relaxing ""Drive"" Is Still Fun To Me."
1,Too juvenile for a 10 year old,Purchased this racing game for my grandchildren. They currently successfully play the Need For Speed series. The control setup is counterintuitive. The average age of my grandchildren is 7 years old. The cut scenes are two to three times as long as the actual play time. I'll likely trade this game at the local used game shop.
4,My son loves it!,"I bought it for my 6 year old son and he loves it! I wouldnt recommend it for anyone older than about 7 or 8 though, I dont think it would be challanging enough."
5,They were very excited when the saw the game,I bougth this for kids of 4-5-6-7 and it is one of my best choice because my children love it and their friends comes every day to play the game.
3,Kachowww......,"This is a good game, driving all over Radiator Springs with no boundries is something my son has really enjoyed. The races are easy but once you get into story mode, some of the objectives are hard to complete. The instruction manual gives you absolutely no tips so the game can take hours just trying to figure out which takes away from actually playing the game. I recomend this game be purchased along with a memroy card to keep track of your progress otherwise it will become tedious and boring."
1,Christmas nightmare,"Hi, I'm VERY desapointed since you ship my order on November 18,2006 and still I haven't receiced it yet!! This suppose to be my little kid present for Christmas and since I never got it a ran to the store the night before to buy him something else. I can rate the game sincve I don't have the game."
5,Mysterious and eerie,"I bought the MP3 for my iPod shuffle. The tracks are eerie and sentimental, with a melodic smoothness. Excellent background music for reading horror or mystery novels; some of the tracks give you that cold-breeze feeling on the back of your neck."
3,"A decent kit, but a mediocre value","This kit comes with everything described, nothing more, nothing less. The bag seems decently constructed and the contents are well thought-out, though remember that this kit is meant for one person: only enough food and water are included for about a day or two. While the foil packets of water might be hard to find, everything else in this kit could be assembled yourself at a far lower cost, though perhaps it wouldn't be so conveniently stowable (the velcro on the back allows me to stick it to my car's truck liner, so I can keep it with me without it sliding around)."
4,"Small parts, but fun",The dolls are 6 in or less and the bunk bed is cute for a dollhouse. My daughter loved this doll when it came out. Her daughter is entrigued now. Cute. For imaginations and great for travel.
1,"""U-boats Destroyed"" - lots of errors","The Great War section is quite good but the WW2 section (the majority of the book) is full of errors, from the dates on which the boats were sunk, the positions in which U-boats were sunk, the cause of loss, some commanders names are incorrect....."
3,good but needs work,This is a good book I found nothing wrong with the world war 1 section but there are some problems with world war 2. Like U67 is not IXB but a IXC. Also a website that i trust alot disagrees with most of the survivors and lost. But overall this a good book. I think maybe Paul Kemp should write second edition.
5,Great gift item,"I bought this for my dad because he had lost pieces of his old Swiss Army knife. This is a great gift set, especially for those who carry pocket knives on a daily basis. One in the desk drawer, one in your pocket. As always, quality manufacturing and a great warranty."
2,"hmmmm, what was I thinking","I bought this for my PSP so that if I was traveling with the kids they could play it (as opposed to their leapster). Well it is too difficult for them, and for me as an adult it is my last choice. For a 8-12 year old, it is probably good, I just can't rate it high for myself or my kids."
1,Full of self-loathing and grief,"Wow. This story is full of characters who I think were supposed to by sympathetic. . . Before I was even a third of the way through, I was hoping it would end with some sort of catastrophic event that killed every character in a terrible, horrific, painful manner.The author managed to take a pretty interesting idea - rewriting the genetic code of a man using DNA thought to be from Christ - and made it dull and very predictable. The mosr amazing feat is that at the same time, he manged to write several characters who were all in need of a .45 cranial injection. The only character I dind't want dead soon into the book was Freddy. I liked him.A very disappointing book, which is a shame, since it shouldn't have been. The base idea was interesting, and worthy of exploration, but the author didn't have the courage to see it through, and instead decided to go with old, worn-out plot twists that anyone could see coming from a mile away."
5,"WOW, This Guy Can Write!","Ever since my bout with a serious illness I've had a constant passion for ""Christian Fiction"" based novels. I am constantly amazed at how many different concepts writers can devise based on the life of Christ. This book is by far the most entertaining ""Christian Fiction"" novel I have read to date, and you certainly do not need to be a Christian to enjoy it. This book is in a class by itself. It is the first book I have ever read through in one sitting - it really keeps you on the edge of your seat! The characters in this book are so real they come to life before your very eyes. Absolutely superb writing and well researched. Thanks Bill for the GREAT READ!"
3,Anybody see Terminator 2,"It was hard to resist picking this book up and giving it a read. The idea was very catchy. The book went along fine (aside from being a bit short for my tastes) until the end drew near. The ending plot degenerated into something almost exactly mirroring the plot of Terminator 2. I wont draw the specific comparisons so as not to fully ruin it for all of you, but I'm sure any who read the book and have seen the movie will agree.and also... Too much scientific data? Surely not. It was all intro level genetics. The previous reviewer must have flunked a few bio classes in college."
3,Page Turner,"This book is a page turner. The idea is good, the characters are pretty good, and the suspence is entertaining. I think though, it could have been edited and tightened up a little and a few strings tied here and there. I enjoyed the main idea of injecting found DNA from Jesus into a killer and the changes that took place in his heart-but the book takes a turn when the opposite gene is abused by the bad guys. Good story fast paced but just a little loose in the writing and some of the language and happenings in the book. It is also labeled Chritian Fiction. It's not strong in the Christian area-it's kind of tossed in but in very light doses."
4,An intriguing look into what makes a man.,"If they could make dinosaurs come back from DNA, what would happen if they tried the same thing with Jesus'?Michael Coleman is a convicted killer on death row who is given what he believes to be DNA from the blood of Christ. His behavior radically affected, he goes back into society. He is transplanted into the Federal Witness Protection Program and unknowingly put to work for the wife of a cop he had killed. He is also stalked by the father of another victim, a man obsessed with seeing Michael die, n"
2,For Beginners Only!,"Really, I can't say this book was good or bad, just that it was made for people who have almost no photography experience. Although things like composition are very important, when it comes to night photography, exposure becomes paramount. But this book gives only the most general of advice in that area! It would have been nice if the author would have at least put exposure information next to each picture (exposure, lens, film speed, and other info would have been even better). The book would be better served concentrating less on talking about ideas for nice compositions...let us, the buyers of the book, find our own compositions...let the book tell us how to get the right exposure for the myraid of different night time conditions. The bottom line: This book is a nice ""chat"" about night photography: don't expect to find any seriously useful tips about the art."
5,Classic,"Heavy on Sociology, yet fantastic for anyone interested in the progression of Western social theory since the Industrial Revolution."
2,A little better...,"Than the last book I read by Lemert. Not his worst, but still not very good. Not recommended as introductory material, because he spends too little time on each author (did he even read Goffman?), but not good for advanced readers either, as they will undoubtedly find his analysis rather shallow."
4,Zany!,"Zany is the word that kept leaping to mind as I read this book! The story begins with Eddie, a young boy in England circa 1800, who must leave his parents due to their unnamed but awful disease (that makes them turn yellow, and go crinkly around the edges) and go to live with his Great Mad Uncle Jack and Great Mad Aunt Maud. Although the trip is only 12 miles to his Aunt and Uncle's house called Awful End it is 12 miles filled with mad-cap adventure.What I loved about this story was the way in which it was told. Ardaugh tells it in a manner which makes the reader feel he is listening to a story made up on the spot, all of the details spontaneous and unexpected, making it all the more hilarious.Ripping good fun!"
4,Happy And Sad At The Same Time.,"Eddie Dickens is a poor little boy who's parents catch a terrible disease,that makes them turn yellow,go a bit crinkly around the edges,and smell of old hot water bottles. Eddie's parents have made the decision to send Eddie to his realative's house. Eddie's realatives names are Mad Uncle Jack and Even Madder Aunt Maud. Eddie is horrified by what had just came out of his parents mouth. He was scared, not only because Mad Uncle Jack and Even Madder Aunt Maud were the most insane people in town, but thier house was called Awful End and ... Wait! instead of me telling you about this exciting book why don't you find out yourself!(Not to be mean or anything like that.) This is an excellent opportunity to read some awesome cliff hangers! Well, enjoy the book."
2,No Comparison to Series of Unfortunate Events,"I was tired of waiting for the next Lemony Snickett book for my boys and bought this. It's truly a disappointment. The humor isn't very good, the plot is boring in fact my children never asked me to keep on reading as they do with their other favorites. Save your $$ and buy something else."
2,Oh Please.,"Ah, for those who can't come up with their own ideas... must copy someone elses. Like the Harry Potter imitations, now a series of unfortunate events has its copycats too. However, I was a bit shocked that an author would be sold bold to copy this closely. Right down to saying what the character will have to endure along the way. Truth be told, the reason I bought this book in the first place is because I thought it was written by Lemony Snicket! But as I began to read, the writing style is clearly inferior. Please, don't support an author who is not coming up with his own ideas, go for the series of unfortunate events instead."
1,And that's for the book designer!,"Ok, I guess amazon has this thing that if it's a REALLY nasty review, they won't post it. This is my 3rd time, and I will NOT stop until it's been posted. This is a terrible book. Lemony should sue. They should be ashamed. The ONLY, and I mean, ONLY reason this was posted because they think the Lemony-copiers are gonna sell. It's so stupid. I can't express how much i hated this book. I stopped reading on the last chapter. There was NO suspension, or meaning for me to read. The reason I was reading after the first chapter was cause I needed some school points and I paided with my own money! Don't buy this book! It has no plot and it is NOT funny!"
3,Freedom Fighter,"What can be said by Bunk that hasn't already been said? A controversial figure of the south, who's technical playing was often pushed to the forefront over his pure love for music. Though this disc contains some rareties, I only suggest it for the true completist. I strongly recommend getting ""...and his superior jazz band"" before this if you do not already own it. ""Panama"" is the true mark of Bunk and his legacy."
1,a bad purchase,"The dress looks extremely cheap!!!! I wouldn't sell it at a yard sell, much less give it away!!! I won't buy from that site again.Signed,Highly disappointed :("
2,Difficult to use!!,This toy was VERY difficult for my son to use. It was also quit difficult for me to use too. So I don't think that it is a fine motor skill or age problem. The one or two times I could actually get the marble to the finish it was only after muttered curse words and a lot of patience. Unless you are looking forward to frustration skip this toy.
2,"Horrible, horrible toy","I don't understand what the other reviewers saw in this toy. You are racing against the clock to complete the challenge in 60 seconds. None of us (ages 5, 16, and adult) were able to complete the challenge at all. While it might be fun to try parts of it, it seems impossible to make it through the whole maze without making any mistakes and having to start over. We are all bewildered as to who would try to market this to children who will quickly become homicidal playing with this. Maybe I should have given it more stars for educational value since it will teach the kids how to swear."
3,"Mediocre copy of the original ""Running Yourself Ragged/ Tricky Golf""","All the challenges are here, but I'm going to need to spend time recalibrating the fit of the obstacles so that they work. The horizontal bars need more pitch at full-open to get the steel bearing to move; the hydrant-shaped pallet that moves the bearing to the last obstacle doesn't have a smooth exit point so it becomes impossible to roll it from the pallet to the bucket. Otherwise, the ladders are correct, the maze is correct, and the jumping pods are fine. For some reason the trick floor won't let me roll the bearing around one of the pegs, but maybe I've lost practice after 30 years of disuse. I doubt it; I spent hours mastering this.I'd say give it a shot, especially if you can take fifteen minutes to remediate the minor manufacturing flaws.-C"
3,"Fun, but doesn't work so well","My 4 1/2 yr old has lots of fun with this, but it took a lot of practice to move the levers just right to get the ball to the next stage of the game. Things don't seem to line up just right. My husband (this is his account) had this as a kid and remembers it being better made. My son has real problems with frustration tolerance, but he was determined to work this thing. Something about this toy motivated him to work through his frustration instead of flinging it, so I guess that's a good thing! That said, we just got this so I'm not sure how much staying power it has (i.e., will he want to play with it more than once or twice?)."
4,Awesome throwback game,I had this as a kid and it's still the same game. Lots of fun and very tricky! A fun thing to pass around at a family gathering.
2,not worth the price,"i like the concept. But it is definitely overpriced and not worth it. I bought it for my daughter and i wish i could return it but its a christmas gift from ""santa"" so we are stuck with it."
5,A Book to Treasure,"This is a book to treasure; a book to read from cover to cover, or a book to read in snatches whenever you are so moved by an event in your life that you cast about for some way to commemorate it, to mark it, to make it special. It is a recipe book for creating celebration and ceremony around those moments in our lives, both large and small, that warrant marking, that warrant respect, that beg for us to stop and notice. Authors Lang and Nayer have gone to the heart of what is missing in the ingredients from which we draw to make our lives memorable. They have added the spice, that missing ""something,"" that can make any occasion remarkable and unforgettable. This is a recipe book for creating ritual. They give us all we need for a perfect result. This book belongs in every home. Give it away freely; share it with friends as you would a treasured family recipe; but, most importantly, use it to create beauty and meaning to mark special passages in your life."
5,What a wonderful book!,"Reading this book was such a comfort. As a society full of people with overloaded schedules, its wonderful to have this guide for inspiration on how to stop and experience bits of our lives that would otherwise pass without the attention they deserve. This is true especially for children. We owe them a slower pace with wonderful rituals and traditions so that their childhood will have memories and meaning. This book is a wonderful primer!"
2,Could have been so much better,"I ordered this expecting it to be a collection of touching essays in the style of ""Everything I Ever Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten"" (with apologies to R.F. if I butchered the title). Instead, I opened the book to find it laid out in more of a cookbook style, with ""recipes"" for rituals. The two authors take turns writing the rituals, and the one author came closer to my expectations that the other, but overall I was disappointed."
1,worthless,It's so hard to tell with heat flashes - so much effects them. But I haven't noticed any decrease in frequency or severity since using this product.
3,Weight is short - or pump volume is off,The manufacturer says 42 pumps per bottle. My wife is avg 31 which makes this product more expensive than expected.
2,Issue with book,The book I received appears to be a library book. How do you know if it is legit? Should come with a disclaimer or release form.
4,"Don't read any review, just see how many stars it got!","It would have been a great story if I didn't read any review first. The title 'Surrender' would have meant more than just a symbol of what inside. The dog was the key to open the mystery but not because of its personality but because of its existence.Some dialogs were composed just the right way to elude guesses but in some scenes you could feel the awkwardness. Well, it's better to find it out yourself."
2,A disappointment,"I'm sorry to say I felt this book didn't live up to its hype. Although the concept was interesting and the writing was at times inspired and evocative, it left me flat. I felt like I'd heard it all before and I found the outcome predictable. I am an extremely well-read lover of contemporary fiction, and perhaps my expectations were just too high. Having said this - I am sure young adults (for whom the book is actually written) would be far more entranced."
2,SLOW PACE,"This book didn't live up to its hype and the 5 star ratings it received. I bought it trusting the amazon ratings. The concept was interesting, the writing at times was ok then slowed to a crawl in some of the plots.I wish publishers were more honest with authors and with some rewrites this story should be a 4 star. But it needs more work. I wish Sonya well in future writings and hope she comes up with a winner. Please don't be highly offended by my comments but book buyers need the truth I felt that I totally wasted my money and the ratings on amazon should have been more acurate!!!!!"
3,Child kills parents,This book was on my child's summer reading list for school. I read it to discuss this with him. The story is about a troubled youth with a mental health problem. I felt that there was some very serious conflicts in the book that should be read not as a summer reading but in conjunction with a class. The whole issue of mental health is one that should be taken seriously especially with young adults. The book should include some discussion points so if the book is read without a classroom situation the parent can discuss the many conflicts in the book with their child
5,Good!,Dark and amazing book. Couldn't put it down. It was written very well. Don't really understand the ending though. Still loved it!
4,Get's better with time,"Well done by Nikolo! This CD gets better the more I listen. The story is rich and I'm really enjoying it. Well arranged, written, and performed."
4,I thought this book was a quick read.,"I have been a judith krantz fan since the beginning, this book is great. I admit that it is not heavy reading but who doesnt enjoy a book that doesnt always make you have to think? The characters are great and I loved Tessa! The descriptions of the jewels she buys made me drool. A little bit of comedy, drama and of course heartache made me never want to put this book down."
2,What's with the names?,"This book was sometimes fun, other times a letdown. It kept me turning the pages, but I found myself wanting to skim it. I guess my favorite Krantz books were ""Til We Meet Again"", and the original ""Scruples."" I also still keep a copy of ""I'll Take Manahttan"" around, only because the humor makes me laugh out loud in places. But her recent stuff has not been as good. And what's with the names? She seems to like to recycle them. This book has a character named Maggie. There was also a Maggie in ""Mistral's Daughter,"" a Marguerite in ""Princess Daisy,"" as well as a ""Maddy"" in ""'Til We Meet Again."" The latter book also had a character named ""Freddy,"" and in ""Mistral's Daughter"" there was a ""Teddy."" Now at the end of this new book, the latest Maggie has a baby named ""Daisy."" Does this sound familiar? No wonder her books are starting to seem recycled."
2,Definitely not a Page-Turner,"It was typical ""Krantz-Glitz."" I probably should have waited for it at the Library rather than spring for it at the book store. I like to share books with out-of-state friends, but hate to spend the postage on a book that is half-ok and half-snore material. Definitely not her best work."
4,a study in priorities set in the most glamorous settings,"I found the development of Tessa Kent as absolutely fascinating a psychological study as can be found in popular fiction. Gorgeous, talented Tessa has the strict upbringing and martyr-mother to guarantee a crisis; which comes in the form of her unacknowledged daughter, shielded by a tight web of family lies. Tessa marries for security, is unexpectedly widowed, finds solace in work, new love, and eventually, with the drama lent by a fatal illness, ultimate reconciliation. Could any of us have made different, better, decisions? The detail of the auction house is delightful, the character development of several friends of the key players well done, and the second-guessing of Tessa's priorities, inevitable."
4,An Absolute Masterpiece,"Reading reviews of some other novels by Judith Krantz, I read that she uses the same general theme in all the books she writes. For me however, this is the first novel by Ms Krantz and I thought it was wonderful. There were some time lapses early on in the book that were somewhat confusing, but in general, it was very well written and thoroughly engrossing."
1,I really wish for a -0- star rating!,"Judith Krantz has turned into a formula writer with only one story to tell: that of a beautiful, yet somehow tragic heroine, who must overcome some kind of adversity to reach the top; marry one of the world's richest, most powerful men; go through another tragedy; and end her life surrounded by friends and family (and most usually, a second husband).This is just too much of a good thing over and over and over again. I know Krantz is no Faulkner, but I've grown a bit tired of the same ole' story, no matter how the scenery changes.Either quit or find a new framework for your stories! I won't be purchashing any Krantz books for a while, not even in paperback!"
4,a life is not enough to live everything,"Reading about cancer in the book was really very upseting.We are surrounded by the desease , by hearing about it in our daily life. Although i have no personal experience, i was so touched by Tessa's situation, that i wish noone lived what she did when she found out.Pain doesn't hurt as much as the feeling of loss."
4,I Love It,"I really enjoyed this one! This one was very different from the others I have read(Scruples I&II, Princess Daisy,Til We Meet Again) I think this one was a lot more toned down then the others, it wasn't nearly as racy. haha. Anyways if you have enjoyed Judith's other books as much as I have, I would highly recommend this book for your next read!"
3,Judith Krantz Lite!,"A quick lite read. Less filling AND half the calories. Ultimately forced to skim quite a few tedious pages but I got through it. The entire segment dedicated to her daughter...the attempted reconciliation, the auction and most especially her daughter's romance are all written as after thoughts...simply a lot of underdeveloped fluff to beef up the page count. Were the books of my teenage years (Princess Daisy, I'll Take Manhatten) really so much better...or have I simply outgrown Judith Krantz all together? My verdict....a libary pick!"
3,Low quality,"The markings on this keyboard are more complete than some I've seen. It has all the diacriticals, which is good. The quality seems shaky. The cord is thin, some of the keys were sticky when I got it, and the Enter key is so narrow you often miss it. It's a decent Arbic keyboard for the price I guess, but my former keyboard seemed a lot sturdier.**Update: Around 4 months after getting this keyboard, it has malfunctioned. A couple keys have started to cause odd behavior. I have had to replace the keyboard. I do not recommend this keyboard!"
4,The Young Colonists A story of the Zulu and Boer Wars,A really good book well written and quite absorbing .I had trouble putting it down I felt like I was in Africa .
3,Interesting,Interesting view of the Boer war. I picked up a lot that I had not encountered before. Of particular interest was the differences between the behavior and attitudes of the Dutch and English from an early 1900s perspective.
5,A Thousand Clowns,"This comedy for 4 males, 1 female and 1 12 year-old boy tells the story of a New York writer who quits his writing job to raise his young nephew and do everything he has always wanted to do. His non-conformist ways soon attract the attention of social services who are concerned about the welfare of the child."
5,Any carpenters must tool.,"As a carpenter for 15 years, most houses I build are over 30ft.in one direction or another. The length of the tape is critical for most work done on the job. The Stanley 35' tape is durable, rigid, and is the tape of my choice since Stanley made them a few years ago. The stanley 35' tape helps me from having to go get a bigger tape. If you want the job done right get a Stanley 35' tape measure."
2,Broke Almost Immediately,"I am a construction superintendant for a pool company. I use my tape for quick measurements maybe 5-10 times a day. This tape was great for about a week, then is started to get sticky. After another week it split lengthwise and caused a pretty nice cut on my finger when it was retracting.I thought this was a good deal, I learned my lesson and will be going back to the more expensive tapes."
5,"Simple part, super solution","The old gas guzzler has been sucking gas through a thin straw... well... I just swapped out the old filter with the new and the car has regained some pep. After getting all the fuel out of the old filter, I could tell it was noticeably heavier than the new one... that extra weight was the sludge trapped in the filter!Changing the filter was super easy, minus getting the hoses removed from the old one. Once they slipped onto the new one, they were snug enough to leave on without clamps, but I tightened the clamps on anyways.The other 'challlenge' was locating the fuel pump's relay, which I could never find despite all the documents and 'maps' I used... It was much more simpler to find the power plug for the fuel pump and umplug it.... all for the purpose of relieving pressure in the line before the replacement."
2,Body Shop Lip and Cheek Stain review,"The color is way too sheer...does not even give nice natural rose color to my very pale lips. I will try another lip stain product. Also, it is drying to the lips and causes them to feel sticky."
2,A Better Product...,"A lip & cheek stain I like a lot better than this one is You Glow Girl Lip & Cheek Stain. The colors are better (red & coral) and it stays on longer. I've bought it before on eBay, but they also have a website where you can see a picture of a model wearing it. I think the web address is [...]. I hope this helps!"
4,great price for a good stain,"This stain is a lot like benetint, except it has no smell and taste(which is wonderful), it is a liquid like benetint and it takes a little longer to dry between coats, doesn't last quite as long but much longer than regular wear obviously and isn't as easily layered/darkened, and it is more pinkish of a red than benetint(which is a great bonus for me).I think many stains are highly overpriced so I really appreciate the body shop coming out with a cheap alternative that in my opinion still holds up in quality; I use it on my cheeks with great results and layer it over my benetint(on my lips) to add a less red and more pinkish-red effect.This is a good sized tube for $ 12 and it will last awhile."
1,Well researched and biased,"Save yourself some dinero. I'll summarize the book for you in one sentence: ' The author does NOT like Texas.' Also, the Kindle edition is badly formatted and looks like it was reproduced on a pre-Xerox high school copy machine. Definitely not value for money."
3,Works with only Yahoo Messenger 8,"I use the CIT310 for Yahoo Messenger and the landline port is connected to a grandstream VOIP adapter. It works very nice, and the voice quality is great for yahoo as well as the VOIP call. Just the limitation is the yahoo version, but if you need Yahoo Mess 8.1, please mail me at sarthak5@gmx.com and I will send you the installable."
1,DO NOT BUY,There is no current support for this with the newer yahoo messengers. you will not be able to use it anytime soon it seems. it looks like yahoo ont support it neither will the manufacturer Linksys
4,Great Battery Life,"I bought this cordless phone almost 3 years ago, it worked fine with my old version of yahoo messanger, i haven't used it with the new version.As these days i only use it as my normal phone, this phone has the most amazing battery life.Its now 3 years and battery life is just awesome, with one charge almost 2-3 days.....If you are looking for a decent phone with good battery life then you can always give it a shot...."
2,hard to figure out,"THE IDEA OF THE PRODUCT IS GREAT, BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT. WE STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO OPERATE IT PROPERLY. WE GOT FRUSTERATED TRYING TO USE THE ON SCREEN INSTRUCTIONS, SO WE GAVE UP!! I ALMOST SENT IT BACK. WE USE IT FOR RECEIVING CALLS ONLY! WHAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY IS TO TALK LIVE WITH SOMEONE, TO TRY TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK IT!"
2,Pretty desappointed,"We bought this phone in order to make/receive calls with Yahoo Voice, using Phone Out and Phone In. But, apart from its nice design, this phone didn't meet our expectations, mainly because of its unability to transfer contact data from your Yahoo Adress book. And entering contacts in the phone or simply navigate into the menus wasn't the best part. However, this phone seems to be a better performer for PC to PC calls (Yahoo Msgr directly) since you can directly access your Messenger contact list."
3,Reaching for the other stars,"Phone works just fine with my regular line. Having trouble with others hearing me on Yahoo. Needs more detailed instructions for sound setup through Yahoo. Will keep trying, and when I figure it out, I'll give it two more stars"
2,User,"The CIT 310 phone is a great idea , but there are major problems with the phone that detract from its full potential. The first problem is that the sound volume heard by the phone user is way too low and as far as I can tell unadjustable. This is also true for calls placed over the regular phone line even with the phone disconnected from the computer. The sound heard by the people being called is satisfactory and most of the time they report a real clear sound. The second problem is that if the computer is in sleep mode, either an incoming call or an attempt to use the phone will restart the computer. These two problems make the phone not very useful to me.1/25/07 Beware the obvious. The navigation bar adjusts the volume. The user manuel does not tell you this nor did my contacts with Linksys. I now think this is a very good product and would rate it as a 4 star."
5,The Best VOIP on the Market,I'm deployed oversea's which the price per minute for stateside calling is crazy.I brought this phone with a yahoo phone out and phone in account and it costs me 3 bucks a month for a stateside number with a pre pay account at 1 cent per minute for state side calling while overseas.It doesnt get any better then that..
2,Not Mac OS compatible,"These items were sold to me out of manufacturers warranty by more than a year. Also , they are not Mac OS compatible. The manufacturer said they are now going to support Macs but they have not shipped any .Al"
1,Disappointed,When I reeived the phone I had problems getting it to program into the computer. I called the manufactor and was told the phone was two years old and there for the warrenty was expired. I could not believe I received a product that was all ready that old. I have my doubt about buying on line again exspecially with Amazon. I was really looking forward to using the phone. I returned the phone and im waiting for my refund.
1,Does not work with Messenger 9.0,i cannot make this product work with Yahoo 9.0. It is too old of a phone and no longer supported by Linksys.
1,Keeps Dropping USB Connection with Vista,"Product drops and then reestablishes the usb connection in Vista for no apparent reason. Half of the computer screen shows the status of the phone as it goes in and out of connection. The connection messages keep piling up. Can't get the phone to work. Wondering if WORLD WIDE DISTRIBUTORS is selling fake products. It would be my guess that this phone is a fake.If you check with Microsoft, the CIT310 is compatible with Vista.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
2,Not usable for VoIP,"As a regular Yahoo! Voice user, I was excited to see this product become available, and ordered one as soon as I saw it.It was easy to set up, and worked well, out of the box. I did some normal land-line calls (non-VOIP), and it worked well. It downloaded my Yahoo contact list to the phone, but I wasn't able to select a number to dial over the normal line. I had to dial the numbers myself.Then I made a VoIP call, and things fell apart. The calls completed successfully, but both people I called complained of echoes and low volume, so much so that they said they felt it was unusable. The problem got worse the further away from the base unit. Given the generally high quality of Yahoo! Voice, I was extremely dissappointed.Hopefully a software up will become available to improve this, but for now, I would hold off purchasing."
2,Functionally partially satisfying,"I'm glad I got it for the lowest price I could find. Althought the people on the other end sound only slightly disatant, there's not any static or anything of that sort - but it is pretty hard to hear them, and I've not had much luck in finding anyway to adjust to volume in a discernable way. The calling out works fine, once you figure out what settings to put the mic and speakers on - but that took some trial and error. And just when you think you have it, someone calls you, and the settings that worked for calling out, don't work for calling in. haven't had a chance to convince someone to trouble shoot it with me - it'd take them making a few calls while I try the different settings options. So it's functional. partially. And I think I recall recieving a call on it successfully once, but I don't remember the settings I used. The literature/manuals were not vista based or the latest version of Messenger, so the settings they described didn't apply."
1,Linksys CIT310,The Linksys CIT 310 is pure trash. No help what-so-even from Linksys. Several of us purchased these units and none worked as described. It is better to use Yahoo and pay for the minutes directly than to waste the money on this Linksys CIT 310 item.
1,Useless Device Poorly Supported,"For me, this product was useless. I could never get the base receiver and handset to communicate. Technical support was non-existent nor did anyone respond to my email queries. The knowledge base on the manufacturer's web site did not contain any information on this problem, which seems to be something that should have been addressed. I will never buy another LinkSys product."
1,Linksys CIT310 Dual-Mode Cordless Phone for Yahoo! Messenger,"works one out of 8 times that I connect it to my computer. I mostly gave up and use my Yahoo on the computer directly. I purchased a kensington blue tooth phone so that I could snip the wires and walk and talk which was my initial goal of purchasing the CIT310 phone. The one saving grace, I was able to plug in my vonage telephone line so that I could have ONE device on my desk. The concept is GREAT, COOL and VERY useful when it works."
1,I returned it; it kept crashing Yahoo Messenger,"It's a pretty cool idea but it just didn't work for me, so I returned it.The phone kept crashing Yahoo Messenger.When I'd make or receive a call, it would make Messenger go off-line.I wasted a lot of time upgrading Messenger and making sure I had all the current drivers (I use XP) for the phone but there was no fix I could do myself.Complicating matters, I don't have a standard phone to call tech support. So, I just gave up and returned it.THANKS AMAZON for your liberal and easy return policy. You guys deserve five stars for that.PS to the makers of this procuct: As I say -- it's a good idea for a product and I hope you develop it. I may still be a customer. For future models, I strongly suggest a more transparent integration of the phone with the Yahoo Messenger contact list. For example, it should be easy to take a number I've received (land line or VOIP) and save it to Messenger right from the phone."
4,"Good Product, recommended to friends and bought 3 more","I bought this online and Shipped this through Aramex Shop & Ship to the Middle east.Good phoneGood even when connecting through a 56K Modem internet connection.Seems to be much better than using a headset with yahoo voice.Power Adaptor is a problem for our region because that does not support 240V, hence bought a 240V-110V converter for US$1 .Overall a good buy"
1,Piece of a Junk for $82.00,"It is only good for pc to pc calls via messenger. In other words, use this as a wireless headphone/mic. It does that job great ( I would have given 5 stars if that was the only purpose with this gadget). But if you are paying $80.00+ and expect a good job with this phone, you are wrong. It is junk for that price. Lot of troubles with hearing while talking on home phone line. No problem with yahoo voice. Cannot dial international access ""+"" sign. Usermanual is another junk came with this phone. Pls dont buy this unless until you are looking for a wireless headphone/mic to use with yahoo messenger.I am happily returned this junk today! :)"
1,WOULD NOT WORK,AFTER RETURNING THE FIRST UNIT I TRIED TO GET THE REPLACENT UNIT TO WORK EVEN TOOK IT TO A COMPUTER REPAIR SHOP TO SEE IF I WAS DOING SOMETHING WRONG THIS COST ME 40 DOLLARS. THE SHOP MAKE IT WORK OR SO THEY SAID BUT I STILL COULD NOT GET THE PEOPLE I CALLED TO HEAR ME OVER THE PHONE I ALSO SPENT HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH THE MANUFACTURER TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK FINALLY GAVE UP AND RETURNED HAD TO PAY SHIPPING TO RETURN IT ALL IN ALL WAS OUT TOO MUCH MONEY AND TIME
3,Yahoo! cancelled their call-in/out service Jan-2013,The phone worked fine. Was a pain to setup because the phone software hasn't kept up with Yahoo's updates. Had to use a lower version of Yahoo. NOTE that Yahoo! has discontinued their phone service. Now I must put this device in the electronics recycle bin.
2,Poor interface,"I had a tough time getting it recognized by messenger. It only works with version 8 of messenger. When it does connect, the volume is too low. The phone is too small and the cradle tips over easily. Not recommended."
5,this phone is awesome.,"this phone is awesome..the voice quality of this phone is awesome whoever says that the voice quality of this phone is low or bla bla..is wrong trust me this phone voice quality is awesome..for the people who use yahoo messenger..this phone is perfect gift is for them..i really recommend this phone for every one who want to use yahoo messenger only.u cant use this phone with msn,skype,other messenger.."
1,Linksys CIT310 with Yahoo Messenger,"I have Yahoo Voice,thru Yahoo Messenger. So I ordered two CIT310 with Yahoo messenger. I also have Yahoo VOICE service.After connecing the phones to the internet, I found out that the Yahoofeature only works with the people you have listed on your Messenger List.Well, that was of no use to me. I need to call everyone through Yahoo, and this CIT310 will not do that.I don't have a LANDLINE phone. So I am totally Yahoo VOICE internet user.Returned the phones for credit.. Signed up with [...] and got a YIFI Skype phone, and it works great."
1,Buy a microphone headset instead,"I am a huge fan of Linkys -- except when it came to the CIT310. I had problems from the very beginning. I have looked far and wide on the net for solutions, but all I come across are people who have similar problems and solutions that are supposed to work, but don't.I don't think the CIT310 is Vista compatible (not too many things are, including myself) and I tried both versions 9 and 8 of Yahoo! Messenger. The audio will sometimes work for 2 seconds and then switch back to my default speakers.Regardless, support for this is horrible as Linksys has not come out with a new driver or a fix and neither has Yahoo!The bottom line: Invest in a headset instead."
3,yahoo phone,"works ok could have been better, have to use the speaker phone tho to hear who i'm talking to"
2,Linksys yahoo dual mode phone,Product works but leaves a caller id of 7777777777 which some folks will not answer; also; adding numbers to the phone is a pain in the but too. I would not buy phone again for these reasons. It does work though.
2,Serious Limitations!,"At the offered price, this is a good buy. Caveat Emptor! However, be aware that it will not dial out from the phone book using Yahoo Messenger Voice.If you are willing to insert the numbers for every call you wish to make, involving the entering of some 14 or 15 digits, then you should be quite happy with the results. The instruction manual is sadly lacking in describing exactly how to make calls, but a search of the Linksys web site will turn up some useful help from other users."
5,My review,"This is a great product, it has all of the features that a simple guy like me needs for my phone service. I was a bit skeptical about a phone that works with yahoo messenger but after getting it connected and working I am very pleased, I live in an RV park and the reception is great this phone works from a distance of one block in any direction from my RV and I will most assureadly recomend this product to anybody that is looking for a good phone,And also when we travel it is great because I use a wireless air card for internet so no matter where I go and provided that I have internet signal, I have phone service in my RV thanks again for a wonderful product!!!!"
4,"Great, but could be better","The phone is good for the most part, and works nicely. It would sometimes have problems if the other end is not a good connection, and the ear piece sound could be louder.The phone's software sometimes mysteriously goes inactive, and has to be restarted, but considering this is one of the few phones that works directly with Yahoo Messenger, it maybe an only choice if you are not interested in the competitor.I also would have expected to customize it better with phone's software, as most phones with a USB port could sync address books, and a number of other things. This only gives you a means to align with Yahoo Messenger. Also with Yahoo Voice Messaging, it is impossible to listen to voice messages without changing the speaker to your PC, restart, and change back to the USB, and restart."
5,"Plug and play, really easy to use, no problems.","This phone is fantastic for two people with a broadband internet connection to talk to each other. I use this phone for calls to canada which were running me 2 cents a minute using a phone card, now they are free, I can talk for three or four hours without spending a penny. Instant messaging just got an upgrade."
2,i guess its ok,well im in iraq and i figured i buy this phone so i could communicate with my wife through yahoo messenger at first the phone was working ok..well for about 3 hours. then all of a sudden my sound settings were altered horribly and the phone stopped working i finally figured out how to properly use it and lets just say it works when it wants...your better off buying a headphone set....
2,Too little,"Although the content and presentation are solid and as good a resource as the previous Volo's guide books, there is just far too little of this one. You aren't getting your value's worth for the amount of content when compared to the preceeding books in this series.By the title, it would seem this is being marketed more as a hint book for the upcoming computer game, but the book is not a hint book. Instead, the name seems to be a ploy to bank on the name-recognition of the computer game. The setting for the book is the same, but the presentation of the material makes it clear that any use it has as a clue book is buried deep... very deep.If the format and concept for this book appeals to you -- a Dungeons & Dragons take on travel guide books -- you'll get more from one of the earlier editions than from this one."
2,Conflicting Forgotten Realms,"While I enjoyed some of this book, it was a major disappointment to realise it bore no resemblance to the Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn lands and areas in the game. I wasn't looking for a hint book or strategy guide, but this book arguably should have been relevant to places in the game and really missed a trick in not offering readers info on, for example, the Copper Coronet, purposes of the Hidden in Athkatla, or history of family feuds in Trademeet. I still got through the book and found it interesting, but sadly not related to anything else I've read or played."
5,Great for the price,"I love this shampoo -- it smells delicious and it works quite well; I did notice a tiny bit more poofiness in my hair when I switched over from Pantene, but it's hardly noticeable. For all practical purposes, this shampoo is just as good and much cheaper. I definitely recommend it."
5,brilliant,"How much do I love this band? Everyone needs to get this Rex if only to bathe oneself in the splendor and magic of ""Blue Eyes You're Not."" It rips me into pieces and is one of my all-time favorite songs. Ever. I can't say enough and I'll leave it at that."
5,This book is a treasure,I just received this book which I had purchased for my son. I wanted to read some of it ahead of time and just read the first two chapters and had to come and write a review. It is so much more than I could have imagined or hoped for. It says so many things that I want my son to know and think about but did not know how to say. This book is amazing and I cannot recommend it enough. It is a treasure. I cannot wait to read the rest and share it with my son.
5,Echo Rave Reviews,"I read Bob's other book, Created For Work, and absolutely loved it! My children (boys and girls) and I all gleaned so much from it. So I was greatly encouraged to purchase Boyhood and Beyond for my husband to go through with my son who is still at home. They are about 5 chapters into it and are thoroughly enjoying it. At first my husband thought this was a bit young for our son (16), but as they've continued reading and discussing he finds it is still very applicable for training up a young man. In fact, he wishes that he'd had just such a book as a young man himself! We have taken Bob in as part of our family now.God bless,Shymilan"
3,Nice Price,"Good value cleaner if you need a carpet vacuum.Plusses: PRICE, Good suction and cleaning on mid length and short carpeting. Accessories store on board cleaner very nicely. Bags are very clean as opposed to the bagless models.Minuses: A little cumbersome. If you have a LOT of carpet to clean this may tire you out a bit. Cord not self storing, and seems a little short.The bonus cleaner is OK and real good for stairs and around the litterbox when you don't want to drag out the big cleaner. Also good for Automobile floors."
3,Average Performance,"The Eureka upright allows you to adjust the height of the vacuuming mechanism depending on the height of the carpet. I find this a useful feature because I have numerous area rugs of various thicknesses. I find that the upright is heavy and difficult to negotiate around heavy pieces of furniture. I have also found that the paper bags tend to leak dust while vacuuming. I have tried different brands of vacuum bags made for this model, but all seem to leak even when the bag is about one quarter full. The corded bonus handvac is quite good, but would be much more convenient if battery powered."
1,Cheap - Don't Buy!,"If you're planning to buy a colander go for the stainless steel variety. I made the mistake of buying one of these enamel on steel ones a year ago. The paint started chipping on the bottom, bubbles started to form and it has become rustier and rustier over time. It seems that the enamel doesn't handle hot temperatures very well. Hmmm? Well, if you are planning to drain pasta, vegetables or anything else from the stove from a container that has hot water in it, you're going to have a problem. But isn't that what these colanders were designed to do? That is, withstand hot water."
2,"Nice looking, but...","This product looks nice, but was quick to rust around the bottom. I still use, but it will soon be retired to the garage to be used as a planter or something. Not sure I'd purchase again."
2,"Functional, but...","As others have noted, water eventually gets under the paint and rusts the metal, which is both unattractive and perhaps unsafe once the paint starts to peel. That said, we did get many years of good service from ours. But it's headed for the trash bin, to be replaced by one made of stainless steel."
2,The steel under the enamel rusts,"We bought this colander and after about two years, rust was evident at the edges and under the enamel. Which of course makes it unusable for food preparation. Not recommended."
5,Perfect colander,I have two of these in different colors. They are the perfect size for hot pasta or washing fresh veggies.
3,Decent Book..,"Expect a little more for the price of $11.95 plus tax, the book is only 135 pages.Good advice on speaking at weddings, eulogies, impromptu etc.Overall, pretty good book."
2,Honda TT Golden Years,"Pro: Footage from 50 years of the TT; Interviews with Joey Dunlop.Cons: Somewhat chronological, but otherwise random assortment of video clips, some of which don't really deal with Honda at all. Almost like someone was tasked to fill a DVD with anything that somehow has to do with Honda and the TT. No effort made to produce a narration. Title menu is useless. I've purchsed other Duke videos that show the same lack of love for their product, and this was the last one for me. No more Duke."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I've had the pleasure of both meeting Dave Hole in person and seeing him perform live. I decided to skip the two shows in Chicago this past month, though, as this release soured me a bit on him. Dave Hole, like many artists, loses a bit with each release. The smoke and fire of his first two releases just isn't there anymore. Each release is of lesser quality than the one before it. I'm afraid the next one will be acoustic. If you're a true Dave Hole fan, this one can find a spot in the collection. For first time buyers, however, check out the searing ""Short Fuse Blues"" and ""Working Overtime""."
2,You're not so good Dave!,"I'm a bluesfan from Brazil,and like others,don't liked this last Hole's work.He's far from his originals two best works,and we're waiting for better days! Poor album!"
5,Great Starter Set,Perfect size board- Magnetic pieces and storage drawers make it very portable- Very nice smooth wood finish- We got our money's worth!
3,Chess Set,CHess set slightly smaller than I imagined. seems to be of good quality wood. Pieces magnetic.
3,Great compact portable chess set!,"This chess set is easy to transport and does not take up a significant amount of space. The drawers for storing the pieces are not of the highest quality or the best design, however, overall the board looks nice and does the trick!"
3,Nothing special but does the trick,"Board is ok, pieces are perfect size. However the magnets are kind of weak, only the pawns stick well to the board as the king,queen,knights,rooks and bishops tend to slide off the board when holding sideways. The drawers sometimes get stuck when you try to open them but overall is a nice board does the trick. They probably should lower the price to around $25-$30 dollar range that's about what it is worth."
2,Damaged ):,Loved the product but it was damaged. Wood was cracked. He was disappointed. Sending it back today. Will order another one.
3,A good beginning but Adler leaves out important details.,"With great illustrations, Adler gives us the bare facts of Columbus' life, however, he leaves out the passion of the man that children can really appreciate. Furthermore, Adler ""forgets"" that 1 reason Columbus sailed was to find new lands but another reason was to win converts to Christ. This & other historical information is lacking in his book. I was left with more questions than answers based on this book & will be looking elsewhere for these important answers. I wish the end of the book had a ""parents note"" with a synopsis of Columbus' life in more detail."
5,"Solid, well made","Stanley is what I have been using for the past 40 years. Well made, solid, built like a tank and always ready when you need it. The only lament is that the back of the tape is without the old lumber specs, etc."
4,Been a loyal Stanley customer,"I have used this model of tape measure for probably 30 years. The 12' is compact enough to carry easily. The previous versions have been made of metal. This last order came and I noticed that the case is plastic. It looks good, but we will see what happens when it is dropped a few times. I gave it 4 stars because of the plastic case instead of metal."
2,Liked the book,"Was a helpful book but it was too many questions. The questions, though, were good. I mentioned in another review that at this point there is a newer book out called ""Top 5 Questions to Ask Your Doctor"" that lists the questions by medical condition. Found that book more helpful.Top 5 Questions to ask Your Doctor: Important questions your doctor wants you to ask about your medical condition"
4,Kick A** hardcore,"This an old a** release now. I dug it then, I dig it now. It's loud, fast and harsh, if you like hardcore it's well worth the purchase."
4,Nice Change of Pace,"I picked up this album in Germany after seeing one of the videos on tv. Obviously, the album is in German and unless you understand the language, it can be difficult to undestand. However, the beats are unique and there are some nice cuts from American artists (like Ludacris). It will be interesting to see how this artist does on future albums, esp. if he is in collaboration with some of his rap peers."
4,Genesis is back!,"Not far from being a great Genesis album, Duke is nonetheless a very good one. The group moved farther into the pop domain and began to see some serious mainstream American success.The engineer compressed the daylights out of this album. It annoys the heck out of me to hear overt ducking on a CD! In the vinyl days, compression was essential for long albums like this one--otherwise you run out of groove space. And it sounds fine on the radio. But it doesn't do anything for listening on headphones or good speakers. I don't know whether the compression was addressed in the remaster or not--I haven't bought a new copy. (Yet.)The coolest thing about this album is that it contains the ONLY pop song that I've ever heard on the radio in 13 meter. That's right--part of Turn It on Again is in 13/4. Who'd a thunk it."
2,Duke marked,"Duke marked the start of the late period of Genesis (1980-1997) when the band were a pop/rock act with less then 4 prog rockers on every album. As such Duke seriously comes up short. Theres a lot of terrible numbers on this album and the only highlights on this album are the 2 and 1/2 minute intros of Behind The Lines and Duchess, the endings of both songs, the instrumental part of Dukes travels (not the lyrics which are unoriginally lifted from Guide Vocal) and Dukes End even though it is also unoriginal. These places show the group could atleast still show great creativity."
2,the beginning of the end...,"During the 80s and 90s, Genesis would release many lousy albums, and this is the first. Compared with Genesis prior to this album, ""Duke"" is sort of like giving Dali or Picasso a frontal lobotomy, and then watching them drool helplessly while wearing a straightjacket.""Misunderstanding"" is a terribly simplistic song better suited to Barry Manilow; ""Please Don't Ask"" might have worked for James Taylor or Bread. But these songs aren't Genesis.The only good tracks are ""Behind the Lines"" (first half only) and the awe-inspiring closing suite, ""Duke's Travels/Duke's End"", which fully reveals Genesis' potential.Otherwise, this album is mind-numbingly simple and uninventive. Do yourself a favor - buy all Genesis albums before this one."
2,How can this album be rated 4 1/2 stars ?,"I am wondering how can ""Duke"" have an average of 4 1/2 stars ?In my mind, the opening and the closing tracks are the highlights of the CD. ""Behind the lines-Duchess-Guide vocal"" is greatly done. The best of the album is by far ""Duke's travel-Duke's end""The hits ""Misundertanding"" and Turn it on again"" are totally burned songs, we have heard them too often. The rest is so-so, nothing memorable there..."
1,Horrible,This is trash! This is where genesis truly sold out and I can't believe all the good reviews it is getting. Genesis use to be a great prog band and then Peter Gabriel left but they were still doing well without him. But Hackett left and Genesis was destroyed. They should have changed their name.
4,Dave,"I started my fandom of Genesis with Invisible Touch and thought it a great album, only when I started to delve deeper in to their progressive roots did I find how powerful their music could be. With Duke, admittedly, it isn't progressive, since they had all but done away with that after ""And then there were Three"" but it is by far their best non-progressive album and the beginning of Phil Collins writing career (two of the songs on the album were actually written by Collins when he wrote his first solo album ""Face Value""). So as far as Modern Genesis fans are concerned this is a complete must have."
4,Just as good now!,"I remember well, a flight to India in the 80's and on the audio, Thai Airways were playing this album.Well, its still as fresh and engaging now as it was then....20 odd years later.Probably not as well known as other Genesis work, but still, for me, evocative of a different time.Definitely enjoyable."
3,Transitional Album,"This is the clear transitional album from Progressive Rock to Commercial Pop. Consequently, the album has a little of the old style (""Behind The Lines,"" ""Dutchess) and the style they would devote the next ten years to (""Misunderstanding,"" ""Alone Tonight,"" ""Turn It On Again."") The net result is neither ""old"" Genesis fans, or ""new"" Genesis fans will be left completely satisfied. When compared to the dreadful Abacab and Invisible Touch, which is essentially a collection of singles as opposed to a cohesive album, Duke is a gem."
5,Monumental,"Duke is the best Phil Collins-lead Genesis album. Duke's densely-textured sound is to be found nowhere else in rock music. This CD runs through a range of emotions-from the jubilant ""Turn It On Again"" to the sorrowful ""Alone Tonight"". ""Please Don't Ask"" is so personal, I can't believe it was even recorded. The album is so well thought out that the themes are quoted again in the last jam called ""Duke's Travels""/""Duke's End"". A monumental recording."
5,Christian Book Previews,"<i>The Salt Garden</i> by Cindy Martinusen is a beautifully woven story of three women: Claire is young, and unsure of where her life is leading her; Sophia is a reclusive author who is questioning love and loss, and the choices she made so long ago; Josephine is a widow from a hundred years earlier, whose ship sank under mysterious circumstances.The story unravels the mystery around the ship, as revealed through Josephine's recently discovered diary. Claire and Sophia are searching for answers independently, but Sophia's fears keep her in seclusion. They learn from Josephine's words as well as each other when God intersects their lives on a treacherous Pacific shoreline.Marinusen's language is almost poetic in its beauty. She brings the truth of God's love to life within the pages of The Salt Garden. It's a book to be savored and lingered over. I highly recommend it. -- <b>Mary Connealy, Christian Book Previews.com</b>"
5,The Salt Garden,Cindy Martinusen writes another can't put down book. The story is enchanting like spending a day solving mysteries at the beach. The characters are so real you want to sit down and share a cup of coffee with them.
4,a fun and impressive concoction,"This is a pleasant surprise, as it received little press that I can remember. This is a great mix of 60's looped beats and keyboards (think Smashmouth for a parallel), with electronic tweakery and a clever use of samples on top - all served with a good sense of humor and fun.If you sent a DJ/Producer in a time machine with some gear, he could play chunks of this at a hip beach party. Besides the cool calt""Cookies,"", you get the cheeky ode to Casey Kasim on ""A Dog Named Snuggles,"" and Aphex Twn meets Willy Wonka concoction ""Toot Sweet Boogie Woogie."" A few of these tracks are forgettable -""Sweet Potato"" and ""Spermy Daydream,"" but on the whole a fun and impressive concoction for those wanting something different."
3,Well-written but fairly choppy,"Mr. Harley is indeed a non-traditional hero- instead of trying to make his way in the world, he seems to care little about getting ahead and prefers to devote his time to helping the less fortunate and hearing their (usually) tragic stories. The stories themselves are very compelling (especially that of Miss Atkins and her father), but they seem to have little connection to each other than that they are being told to Mr. Harley. The ending also seems a little abrupt, though it is certainly sad and affecting.I think that it might have made more sense to present the book as a collection of short stories rather than one disjointed novel. As it is, I still enjoyed it, though I was continually left wondering what happened to characters as most of them are introduced and never appear in the narrative again."
3,An Evangelical Perspective,"As an evangelical, I read this book wanting to know more. SDAs and I disagree on many issues such as the Sabbath, the doctrine of Hell, the doctrine of the intermediate state, and doctrines related to Ellen G. White of course. However, I found refreshingly that there were many orthodox statements. This work largely came due to the interaction of Walter Martin and Donald Barnhouse with SDA leadership. It would be good if the SDA would hold on to the essential doctrines taught in this book like the deity of Christ, the Trinity, justification by faith, and the physical resurrection of Jesus from the dead. I would, of course, like to see the other doctrines that I disagree with changed. However, for now, I do believe that if an SDA held to this book, I could only at worse call him heterodox. Of course, there can be heretics in the SDA church as there can be in any church. Hopefully the SDA movement will stick more to this book and less to contrary teachings. Time will tell."
5,Cute and Funny!,"This is a great book for boys and girls AND adults! If youre a B-52's fan and you have a kid, you MUST get this book - its a real scream! The illustrations are TOO FUNNY!"
3,There is a reason their cheap,"Inlet and outlet are not 2.25"" or 2.5"" they need inserts welded into them to fit exhaust pipes !!"
1,garbage,had this installed today and noticed nothing going back tommarro and haven it taken off had it put in place of resenator and no difference in sound or performance.what a waste of money im better off with a straight pipe thats what my mechanic told me....
1,Stanley 33-425 Powerlock 25-Foot by 1-Inch Measuring Tape,"I did use this tape one time... No abuse just love and care...Stanley 33-425 Powerlock 25-Foot by 1-Inch Measuring Tape is a bad product. The spring of the tape does not work...When you open the Measuring Tape it is written on the plastic spool: ""Not repairable""!!!Stanley does not have the courage to write on the outside of the tape measure: ""Not repairable"".Customers understand that ""Not repairable"" means garbage in the toolbox.Stanley used to have good tools.Do not buy any Stanley Measuring Tape. You are getting garbage!!!"
3,"Good tape measure, but casing is cheap plastic!","I bought this tape measure to replace our old one, which was also a Stanley Powerlock, but unfortunately broke. However, I'm not happy that the case on this tape measure is cheap plastic instead of the original metal housing of our previous one. The tape measure works well, but I'm very disappointed that the manufacturer chose to replace the durable metal case with plastic, which is more likely to crack if it's ever dropped accidentally on a hard surface. I'll be looking for a more durable tape measure."
4,Almost perfect,"The product looks exactly like pictured on Amazon. It has a belt clip in the back, which Amazon picture does not show.Overall, the item has sturdy case, strong tape, and recoils fast with quality that seems to last a lifetime. For my use, it would have been perfect if it had dual measurements, both inch and metric measure marks."
4,Glad I bought it,I've been needing a tape measure for awhile... and Stanley is a good brand. Haven't noticed any issues with it so far. Packaged Well
4,Stanley's Tape Measure,"Stanley's is a name that I know to be of good quality. I have used mine for years and has held up exceptionally well, however it is time to replace it. I live in the southeast and it is starting to rust."
3,It's OK,It's heavy and big - make sure you get the length you really need!I was expecting a better finish.
5,Classic,"Some things are made right the first time. I'm not sure if this is the exact model I've used before, but this style from Stanley is the best. It's solid, durable, and retracts the tape with some oomph. Don't look any further. This is it."
5,"Great measure, great price","This tape measure is very durable and well made. It is substantial, but doesn't feel like you're carrying around a 10 pound weight either. The tape is easy to read. It stays straight while measuring and doesn't bend and sway all over the place. It is comfortable to use and the lock feature stays put. It rewinds with no issues. Seems like it will last more than long enough to get our money's worth out of it. The price was great."
1,Not quite up to par for Stanley workmanship,"Normal high-quality Stanley workmanship didn't apply to my tape. The first time I extended it to its full 25 feet, the blade literally fell off, the spring motor unwound, and now I'm left with a $12 paperweight. Stanley needs to work on their engineering for this tape to prevent the tape from so easily separating itself from the spring motor. Maybe it wasn't assembled correctly to start? Strange, I haven't encountered this phenomenon with any other steel tape measurer."
1,Junk tape measure!,I purchased this tape measure 3 days ago and the tape measure lock broke on me! It was brand new and I only used it 2 times without any abuse or wear. Founded out that Stanley doesn't cover in their warranty the plastic locking device but rather the tape instead. I'm so disappointed in Stanley... I won't even consider buying their tape measures ever again!
3,"Seems okay, but lacks metric measurements","This looks fine and other reviewers seem to like it, but it doesn't have any metric measurements. I'm probably going to return it."
2,Either product integrity problem or I'm too strong,"I had used one of these tapes for quite a few years, and was very satisfied. But recently, when I was extending it fully to measure a deck, ""sproing!"" the tape fell off, and when I took it apart, it seemed the spring had failed as well.So I went out and bought another one, thinking the first had just exceeded its lifetime. The second time I used the new one, fully extending it, the tape fell off. Taking this one apart, it looks as though the metal piece that is supposed to lock with the tape end had broken off, although the spring still appears to be functional. Other reviewers report similar problems. So now I don't know whether to try again with this tape or try another brand."
2,Plastic!,"Not sure what's cheaper, myself wanting to pay $10 for a 25ft measuring tape - or the chromed plastic imitation that this thing is made of.My 5 yr old used it for a few minutes and the 'chrome' is all scratched. I doubt this will survive falling on the floor.It should say plastic on the product description."
4,They don't make 'em like they used to!,"Nice tape measure, but buyer beware: the case is now made of chromed plastic, not metal. Still a great tape, but lacks the solid feel the Stanley tapes used to have."
5,"""Simple Fitness"" is a Jewel !","This small volume is a priceless jewel, especially for the busy professional, or for anyone else who is time-constrained - both young and old.Each day's entry is a nugget of truth for physical, emotional, and intellectual health. One page a day keeps the Doctor away.I highly recommend this simple, small treasure!"
4,Great book for overall wellness,"Someone from a local spa gave me this book, and I must admit that I read a page from it everyday. It is not a hard and fast diet plan, and that is so refreshing to me. I just pick it up and open to a page, any page, and I learn something that I can truly put into action in my life. Sometimes it's as simple as a more positive perspective, and sometimes it's an actual goal I can truly obtain. I recommend this book for people who are busy and need a wellness guide that can aide them throughout the week."
4,Like the Product,"I've used this before and I like it. I also like that I can order from Amazon and not have to get a Mary Kay consultant, because I don't use a lot of their products and don't need to be hassled about ordering more things. Price was a good buy and when coupled with other things I ordered, I can get the super saver shipping. Karen"
3,good,i use this product for first time and share with my roommate.. she said it was good toner.. but to me.. i didn't like the ingredient.. it was a good product..
3,It's ok.,"This freshener is just ok. I bought it because my friend uses this one for very long time and she loves it. Unfortunately, this freshener did nothing to my skin- it is just freshener (not bad, not awesome) and, for me, it has slightly unpleasant smell. Maybe, someday I will buy it again but not any soon."
3,no show,never received the book - was later informed it was sold by mistake and i received a refund.
5,Great book,My daughter is a cartoophiliac and just loved this Christmas gift. A unique find. Thanks for a really great book.
1,Read the description- don't go by the picture!,"I thought I was buying the pictured 12 pack of Mr. Sketch markers (featuring 12 different maker colors). However, when my package arrived, I discovered that I had really ordered a 12 pack box of only RED Mr. Sketch makers. They come in a typical office supply white box. This product is nothing at all like what is pictured.I suppose the fault lies with me for not reading the description. I ordered this item only based on the picture. I hope others do not make the same mistake!If you want only red Mr. Sketch makers, this is the product for you."
4,A great popular work,"The first thing I noticed about this book was its stunning artistic quality: with full-color art illustrations and diagrams, and beautiful layout throughout, it's worth owning just for its image content.Turnbull is a fantastic popular writer. The book is informative and easily accessible to the general reader, and an invaluable introduction to the samurai, ashigaru, ninja, and warrior monks of Japan's Age of Warring States.Divided into four parts, each detailing one of the different warrior types that Turnbull discusses, the book gives descriptions of individual duties, the warrior's place in times of peace and war, weaponry, dress, daily life, and anything else applicable through examples of individual battles, people, and documents from the time.It's a wonderful work, and I'd suggest it to any person interested in military or Japanese history."
3,This is a good reference book,If the there were more software programs could be applied to the theory it will be better.
3,Passable thrills,"Pretty good direction and a good idea for a Story. But horrible acting. The sets look good too. But don't expect much else. Short on thrills, long on darkness."
1,bad indie horror,"Bad in almost every way (the acting is bearable, but the actors have no characters to play) - writing is awful, no suspense, no scares (unless you're frightened by killer coat-racks)...murky cinematography, cheesy sets...This low-budget mess bears no comparison to the skillful EVIL DEAD and PHANTASM. Total waste of time."
4,Great CD!,"I bought both this CD and the Wicked Karaoke (Stage Stars). I bought the stage stars version first and was so disappointed in the quality that I almost didn't get this one. What a mistake that would have been!! This CD is so much better in terms of musical quality and the pacing within the songs is very similar to the soundtrack. My only disappointment was that it does not contain ""No One Mourns the Wicked."" I was excited to find that it includes both ""I'm Not that Girl"" and the reprise. Also, some people may be disappointed that there are only the instrumental tracks and no practice vocals. Overall, this is a great karaoke CD. For those who love Wicked, I highly recommend it."
2,Doesn't work for every cat!,"We have a horrible time getting allergy medication into our two cats (both have allergies, but welive in the allergy capital of the USA, and we have them too). During the spring bloom and fallharvest time, we need to give them allergy meds. I thought these might help.They didn't.Neither cat will touch them, even without a pill. I did try the pockets without medicine in themfirst, so they would not be suspicious the next time. They both turned up their noses and walked away.These are cats who will knock you down to get chicken!So, can't recommend them for cats in general, but I am sure they'd work well for dogs."
5,Wooly Bear is cute and cuddly!,"I purchased Wooly Bear about a month ago for myself (I'm an adult), and he is as soft and cute as he looks in his picture. He is much fatter than he appears in his picture though, and the beans in his bottom make him pretty heavy (might be difficult for a small child's hands to grab him). His fur is wonderfully silky and soft. Best of all is his warm smile; adults and children will love this bear---he's a charmer!"
5,America's version of THE WHO...,If you're a true fan of the MC5 you'll be doing yourself a major favor if you add this to your collection!Blew me away on the first listen...WAY COOL!!!Slam back a few & enjoy!the dOg
4,First Person Account of Mountain Search & Rescue,"This ethnography is the analysis of one woman's 6-yr involvement with a Mountain Search and Rescue Team in Colorado. I recently joined a mountain search and rescue team, and so I wanted to understand what I would face. The book details the ways the team evaluates new recruits, how those recruits become a part of the team by assuming team identities and memes. I found it very helpful in this regard. Also, the sections on the emotions that arise in rescuers, in victims, and in victim's families --and the analysis of these emotions and the responses to them-- were really insightful and useful. It is a fairly quick read. Recommended for anyone interested in understanding the culture of volunteer search and rescue teams."
4,Awesome Primer,Overall good. End chapters were a little weak but great to get up to speed for other books.I have been programming for 9 years with Microsoft. I found this book a piece of cake and was required to use it during a college course.The instructor recomended to do this with each chapter1. Read the review at the end of the chapter2. Read and try and answer all the questions3. Read the chapter4. Do the excercisesIt was very methodical but it worked to get up to speed fast. I was done with all the chapters in about 4 weeks.
1,Avoid this book!,"I am required to use this book for an introductory Java Programming course. This is the worst text book I have ever used. It is poorly written and filled with errors. The examples, exercises, quizzes and tests are filled with ambiguities. We are in the process of trying to get this book out of the curriculum so that those taking this course in the future will not have to use this garbage."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!!!,"I totally agree with the first review here. This book was so terribly wriiten that I felt liking screaming every time I tried to code the examples following her instructions. If she had put together complete programs instead of tearing them apart, this book would have been just half thick, and would have saved readers a lot of time (and probably some money). It does not even worth one star for the rating.I bought this book because we're using its first edition as textbook. Since the 2nd edition uses the newer JDK and covers more materials, I figured it would make more sense to buy the new edition. I mail ordered the book without browsing it first (it was not available in the bookstores close to my home). Now I really regret it. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS MINE. Invest your money somewhere else."
1,This is the WORST author and editorial staff on the planet,"Filled with errors. Technical, grammatical, structural--you name the problem, this book has it. I tutor programming students and I've seen many different texts. This book is terrible."
5,Great game for the whole family!,"My 7 year old son received this game as a Christmas gift and our whole family has spent hours enjoying it. Most of the activities have multiple levels, the first ones are very easy to finish/win but some of the upper levels are challenging even for my husband and I. This games has provided us with hours of entertainment - taking turns trying to beat the challenges. We started playing in arcade mode, but have found that Storybook mode is much more fun as it ties all of the challenges together, rewarding wins with even more bonuses. I hope you enjoy as much as we have!"
4,Lot's of Fun,My kids received this game for Christmas and they really like it. They think it is a lot of fun.
3,Not my favorite...,"Great movie...only fair PS2 game. Lots and lots of racing...we got kind of car sick and bored...oh well. Definately preferred ""Chicken Little"" PS2 game for our 6-year-old."
1,still waiting,This is taking too long to get here. I am still waiting for it. When I recieve it i will give it a better review.
4,Fun for Preschooler,"I bought this for my 5 year old since he likes driving games. I had to do the set up since he can't read yet but otherwise he enjoys the racing. It's perfect for him since there is an option to do ""open"" driving and not necessarily win a race."
4,Fun for awhile,"We had a little trouble with the level Lizzie's Postcard Hunt. It was easy to find a few postcards, but there were some that we could find but couldn't figure out how to get and some we never found at all. Otherwise, the other parts of the game are possible to do, but maybe a little hard for young kids.Please do not copy this review for use elsewhere on the internet."
4,My 8yr old love's this game!!Super fun!!!,"She can't put it down! It's fun to just watch her having so much fun with this CARS game! Non violant,lot's of things to explore and racing is a blast with MATER!!!Dad has fun racing with her too!!!The cast of cars are all in this game and very funny comment's come from them all!"
4,Great Gift,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and nephew to play together and they are both addicted to the game now.
3,Kids lost interest,"My kids love the movie, but didn't like this game nearly as much. It's a run of the mill race car game that uses the Cars characters and that's about it. They lost interest after playing it a few times."
2,havn't used,it's my taste anyway-& my tasre buds are definitly different after stroke! Nice bottle & price though!
1,Piece of Junk!,"I would have gave it 0 stars if I could. The thing almost never worked, then I ended up throwing the thing away."
2,This book was disappointing; hard to get started,I was looking forward to reading The Joyful Beggar but was very disappointed at how difficult it was to really get into it. I did not finish it. There are more enjoyable biographies about St. Francis.
1,Excruciating,"Painful to watch. If you really want to see Ray Buckland lisp his way through an hour or so of ego masturbation interspersed with uninspired ritual and a buxom naked woman endlessly circumambulating an altar in a mindnumbing rite of self initiation then this is your video! If not, I'd suggest sticking your head in the oven as the next best thing."
3,Good but not great,"A good beginning book but somewhat thrown together. The dialogues and explanations were good, but the exercises weren't particularly useful. It confused me when it said to not make ""baba"" sound like ""barber"". It was obviously written for British people and I often found myself reading with a posh English accent. Oxford, actually. But it was still a good book to learn dialogue and noun classes with. Good Luck : )"
3,"A good book, but not for people with low attention span...","First of all, this is a good book. It covers most of the topics a 1st year radiology resident needs to know. However, it wanders too much on shallow comments and -supposedly funny- jokes that only distracted me from my study. I'm a person who struggles to keep her concentration, I have a poor attention span, if you will, so when I was reading something complex (as most of the subjects in neuroradiology are) and then the authors ended up with a lame joke, it was as if everything I just read became lost. That may be 'my' limitation, as I mentioned, not a real flaw of the book, but I think people who, like me, need a more 'clasically' structured and 'traditionally' written text, should be warned that this volume of the Requisites series isn't the most adequate to suit their way of study."
1,digital edition images a bust!,I like the content but the images of the digital edition are low resolution thumbnail style images akin to what appears on a web browser image search. Clicking the image increases the size but not the resolution. Images on anatomy are like abstract art.
4,"Solid Text, terrible binding","Our RAdiology residency has this text as a reading for book club and of all of us who purhcased the book either this year or in prior years, the binding fell apart within weeks. Unacceptable for any hardbound textbook. Also, the authors are somewhat clever, however I noticed that when you're really focusing in, that some of the comments become distracting--I've even had some of my attendings say you should blacken them out as you go through.Otherwise, a good, concise, well-laid out text. I would recommend except to expect the binding to fall apart regardless of how hard you try...."
5,"Good, but there was some issues","Another book form Requisities series in second eddition. As always, well written solid text with highlighted boxes providing key information. Nice, sufficient illustrations and images. All these content can be impressive, if the book was printed on better quality paper. Provided paper type is not appropriate for radiology imaging books, and I don't understand why such good content cannot be printed on a glossy paper, as other books from same series. May be price can be elevated a little bit, and I think many doctors and resident will still can by it and get real satistfaction form the both, content and containing frame."
4,nice gift,"Perfect gift, looks great, the materials where of high quality. would buy again from this builder and supplier. 10 watches looked great though glass"
4,Really nice,"The case is everything I thought it would be, except that it has a lock on it and I didn't receive the key"
4,This Album Completes Any Yes Collection.,"Back in the day Yes came out of no where with Fragile and got tons of air play with Roundabout. When Close to the Edge was released most of us were anticipating more of the same, therefore it was somewhat of a disappointment because we wanted more Yes rock and didn't even think about Yes art. This album actually defined where most of us were gonna stand on Yes, love 'em or hate 'em. Whether or not it is a great album, like all music, in completely subjective but I can say that no Yes bag is complete without this album. Some music services have provided this album as a ""partial"" and how ever they picked which tracks are good enough for the ""partial album"" is beyond me. What an insult!"
3,OK but...................,"I ordered this CD because my original LP has some surface noise at the beginning on both sides of the LP.Having both CD and the original LP to compare, I have come to the conclusion, that I still prefer the LP over this CD reissue.The CD reissue sounds like it has been over processed to the point where I actually thought my CD player was incorrectly connected to my integrated amp. Almost like the the left and right channels were out of phase compared to the original LP.The LP's sound stage and imagining of the musical event is is sharply focused. Whereas the CD is more diffused and the sound stage is too big.I gave the CD reissue 3 stars based on the fact that it is a very clean recording and fairly non fatiguing ( for a CD)..Rhino should have chosen accuracy instead of hyping and manipulating the sound to the point of distraction while listening."
4,"""Close to the ""Edge"" of Insanity""","This is my favorite early Yes CD. Bill Bruford can drum his ass off, and the CD is just very solid and well put together. A must have for all yes fans!"
4,THEIR BEST.... (4.5 STARS),"Never has an album from this time period felt and sounded so fresh today. Something Yes fans have always appreciated was the timelessness of their albums. Having the opportunity to play an album like this one has been possible for near 30 years, yet you can't get sick of it.And that is true for no record more than ""Close to the Edge,"" Yes's contribution to the music world from 1972. The title track is rumored to be their best and one of the best from their time period. The album/song was so successful, in fact, that they decided to do ""Yessongs,"" perhaps their second or first best, depending on the fans taste or distaste for live music. ""And You And I"" is another muscial masterpiece; a love song that plays out like an antheme. And ""Siberian Khatru"" is no different to the other two in terms of genious. It's featured in most of their live albums and ""best of"" packages. This is their best, and great way to be intruduced to this amazing band."
1,Poorly transferred to CD,"This is almost completely unlistenable because the quality of the CD is so poor. This is true of all the YES records. They weren't transfered to CD very well. Re-mastered versions have more recently come out. I haven't heard them, but this is not worth buying and, unlike the other single-star reviewers, I LOVED this record when I was in my early 20s."
2,friday records yes close to the edge,this copy of close to the edge by friday records sounds compressed not much better then a good cd the 180 gram vinyl is nice but thats about all its very misleading to people that think there getting a good vinyl copy and most off the remastering is done digital i find the only records of this release is classic records or mofi they keep an all analog path from mastering to stamping the vinyl A buddy came over and gave me his input on this record and said the same thing lifeless we a and b the older yes ver. to this new one and it is night and day diff. the old record has all that air and analog warmth thats why we love records but this friday copy why bother
2,NOT the original versions!,"I bought this album exclusively for ""And You And I"". Although the instrumental sections sound basically the way I remember them, the vocals by Jon Anderson are NOT the original version! It is an ""alternate"" version from the original album. If you've never heard the song before I guess it will sound OK, but if you grew up being transported by the original version you are likely to cringe at this re-styling. I had to look to make sure this wasn't a Yes cover band! What a disappointment."
3,Close To Overrated!,"I totally despise the fact that almost EVERYONE says that this is the best Yes album of all time, some have even gone to call this the best prog-album of all time, GIVE ME A BREAK! Now don't get me wrong I love Yes. I will try to explain my point of view in a more subdued manner:I love ""Relayer"", and ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"", yet many others claim that their overblown. I Love ""A Passion Play"", by Jethro Tull, yet that is considered pretentious and JT's worse. I love ""Foxtrot"", but I don't hear many critics raving about it being the definite prog album.""Close To The Edge"", is considered by critics to be the best prog album from them and by many others, it's either their peak, their zenith, or the best prog album of all-time.... ....I wasn't to impressedCatch My Drift?"
1,New tracks? Bonus tracks?,"All of the songs on this album rock. All the bonus songs rock. But im giving this 1 star. Why? It isn't original. The original ""Close to the Edge"" album and CD release had 3 tracks: ""Close to the Edge"", ""And You and i"", and ""Siberian Khatru"". When i buy a cd, i expect the cd: nothing more, nothing less. im terribly disappointed to find that record companies are slapping other crap in these ""reissues"". Even if the bonus tracks were the BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD, that would still be tampering with history. So if you are a classic Yes fan expecting ""Close to the Edge"" untampered, im warning you: this has been messed with. Use caution when buying."
5,The text-book on making a prog-rock album,"YES shows how to do it right no matter how many tries it takes. Forgetting the disaster that is Fragile, Close to the Edge concentrates on solid themes and taking the form in different movements. This album works better than many prog-rock albums, and is an excellent listen. The music gives the listener a sense of the situation and atmosphere involving the songs. An essential piece to any music collection."
4,Can't say no,"4 1/2Undisputed progressive heavyweight EP (at least it feels that way, paired with Fragile to make '72 a most attuned streak) with three stunningly rendered tracks blaring across at speeds which belie intricate composition....but that is what replay value is all about for the buyer and music listener's sake."
5,All these 5 star reviews aren't lying! This is great music!,"I first bought this on LP around 1982-83 simply because it looked like a ""concept"" album. Having been newly introduced to the genre by hearing ""2112"" by Rush and ""Dark Side of the Moon"" by Pink Floyd, I was drawn to the roman numerals that broke up the songs ""And You And I"" and ""Close to the Edge"". I kid you not, that's why I bought this album, because it looked like a ""concept"" album. It was that and more. This is my favorite album of all time--and was the moment I heard it. The haunting melodies and vocals drew me in and I quickly bought other classic Yes albums like ""Relayer"", ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" and ""Going For The One"". Only ""Going For The One"" is as complete and as good as ""Close To The Edge"" though. BUY IT NOW!!! (And by all means check out the other cd's I mentioned)"
5,Raises the Progrock bar out of the reach of most bands,"Let's face it folks, if there is a Progressive Rock album that even afficianados and aspiring musicians can listen to and say to themselves, ""I simply don't understand how this music could sound so good."" Than this is the album. The Beatles wrote very simple songs with really catchy melodies, added some progressive production. It remains a mystery why their songs are such masterpieces. Yes is in a way the inverse of this phenomenon. Yes writes these grand pieces that at times seem to approach infinite complexity, but an underlying simplicity of form and the development of simple melodic themes a la Hayden or Rachmoninov keeps it rooted to the earth. I don't see anything wrong with this album."
5,The album i compare all other albums to,"I must say that it took me about 3-5 listens before the music of this album finally ripped through my soul like nothing ever before. The combination of Jon Anderson's voice and the musical arrangments by Yes tapped something inside me that is better than sex. If i was bill gates i'd buy everyone in the world a copy, and for those who didn't have a cd player i'd buy them that too. That's how essential i believe this album is for mankind to experience. The intro to the first movement of ""Close to the Edge"" is so powerful i get choked up everytime i hear it; i pause to remind myself how glad i am to be alive and hear music as touching as this. You can call me obsessive, or say that I'm exaggerating something insignificant, but one thing i know for sure is that ""Close to the Edge"" has redefined what music can do to a person. Thank You YES!"
2,as shown,I recieved the product and is an original so I have it in my library and just not a download.
2,Going downhill in a hurry,"After the twin classics ""The Yes Album"" and ""Fragile,"" the band released this hotly anticipated dud of a followup. All of the worst excesses that have marred later Yes music begin to show themselves here. Featuring weak songwriting and endless solo noodling, the album lacks focus or ultimately enough rock enerygy to sustain it. And without strong songs to wrap his falsetto voice around, John Anderson can be one of the most irritating singers on the planet. Stick with the previous two efforts mentioned above and skip this one."
2,"Superb musicianship, still an exercise in wankery","I think Yes are the fathers of Dream Theater, indisputable chops; horrible and boring, utterly unmoving songs. Those who say this album is among the finest or the best work ever created couldn't be more wrong."
3,Good thang,"I'd buy Close to the Edge just to listen to Bill Bruford's perfect drum technique.I'm not sure whather I'd buy it for many other reasons. I never cared much for Howe and Squire, overhyped riff makers with little sense of musical balance, although I bet they thought they were top class classical musicians (yeah, sure). Anderson is pitiful here, as he always is. But Rick Wakeman was in good musical shape in 72, and when he wasn't planning some stupid skaters show he could really play keyboards. The album has some pretty good moments, and that's a lot to say coming from Yes."
5,The best music in history.,"This is not only Yes's best album and the best from all of Progressive Rock and rock in general. ""Close to the Edge"" is the best piece of music that has ever been created. Any critic with any brains (the one whose review of Yes appears on this site is obviously not of that category) would rank this right up there with Beethoven, Bach and other masters of their times."
3,Fringe material is sketchy,"In all honesty, if you are thinking of getting this new remaster for the extra tracks don't bother. These ""alternate versions"" are very rough rehearsals and pale in comparison with the finished product. For those who may have found sections of the Beatles Anthology series tedious, the ""alternate versions"" here are along the same lines and not worth a second listen.On the other hand the packaging is very well done and the original album is included so if you don't already own a copy this is worth your while. The mix of the original album is excellent and will please Yes fans old and new."
5,this is the only music there is !,"Having lived the music and going to all the concerts YES is truly the only compleat music there is, starting with 'time and a word' record # 000000004 which i purchased in NYC the first week it came out, and which is mounted on my wall, this started YES in my life.I haved sung the songs, lived them, dreamed them, and have been carried by them to distance lands...I could go on and on, but I woun't, get all the records, and a new turntable and needle, a bong would help some,and drift away and leave all cares behind... Ill see you there some day my friends.remember -close to the edge-down by the river-come fly away.........kliusaf73-78 belview.ne.medic e-4"
5,Best Album Ever,"Close to the Edge is the greatest album, not just in the progressive rock category, of all time. It is a brilliant combination of classical style compositions with 70's rock and roll instruments that creates an extraordinary masterpiece. Having listened to all Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, ELP, Moody Blues, Camel, and Rush albums, I can gladly say that this is the by far the beacon of progressive music.[...]"
5,A PEAK EXPERIENCE,"Years later, this incredible pop masterpiece still gives me chills when the band cranks out of ""I Get Up, I Get Down"" and soars into ""Seasons of Man"".Granted, Yes lost me as the years went by and my interests changed, but this CD, along with ""Fragile"", continues to lift me into a higher awareness with every listen. Critics who argue that it is just prog-rock complexity simply don't get the feeling - or are immune to elation altogether.It's a mind-altering and soul-stirring achievement."
4,Close to the top,"Please spare me the trippy lyrics (new age avant la lettre) but the musiciansip is simply great. Prog rock is often referred to as over the top, but here we find genuine great music, played very well. One of their best (but not their best imo)"
3,where are the remaster sound engineers ?,"Definitely one of the best 5 records of the whole progressive era,unfortunately this edition it is so far to be the best 5 or 6 re-editions done. think! in analogue vinyl form could be sound better...where are the remaster sound engineers?"
5,The cream of the crop,"If I were to buy just one Yes album, heaven forbid, this would be the one. Nowhere else can you find such musicianship. If you are a beginning prog-rock listener, a Yes fan, or want to become one this album is the one to start yourself off with.The Album originally contained 3 tracks with small themes throughout, this album delivers alternates and other tracks that made the band great. Rick Wakeman really shows his talent in this one, as does Steve Howe. The keyboarding and guitar and Chris Squire meld together beautifully throughout.Bottom line, an album like this is essential."
5,A Must-Have Masterpiece,"This is probably the best Yes album ever (and also album in general ever, for at least), as it has been mentioned a lot. The three songs featured here are among the most elaborate and varied in the sense that have different movements, as in classical music, and the instrumentals and vocals are top notch.Close to the Edge is my favorite all time song ,this is, naturally, the studio version where one can appreciate the music in its pure state. Having said that, the live versions (Yessongs) are a lot more rich and appealing. And You and I and Siberian Khatru are very close to Close to the Edge in my favorites list.This album is probably not the best place to start listening to Yes, instead I would look for the Yessongs (has the three songs in live versions and a lot more songs) and then move on to this album to enjoy the original versions."
2,FridayMusic 180g LP reissue sounds worse than my copy from the 70's,"I just listened to FridayMusic's 180g 2008 LP reissue of Close To The Edge and I'm very disappointed with the quality of the pressing. Before putting the LP on my Pro-Ject RM5 turntable with Shure V15VxMR cartridge, I washed it thoroughly with a Nitty Gritty record cleaner. Unfortunately, I found that there is a lot of unwanted noise on this LP that can only be attributed to the quality of the pressing. I'm sending it back. This is unacceptable for the price. This is my first FridayMusic pressing and I think it will be my last."
5,Way Out There - Awesome,"I accept that this is probably the best of all Yes' studio efforts. Everything seems to come together here. The music runs the gamut from widly aggressive Mahavishnu-eqsue guitar jamming to pastoral but it doesn't sound fragmented; it sounds natural and classic. 5 very strong musicians each excel here and drive each other into a great realm.""Siberian Khatru"" is complicated, driven by guitar and keyboard lines that sound like a cross between Stravinsky, ""Kind of Blue"", and maybe the aforementioned Mahavishnu Orchestra. It's a favorite of mine, wildly intense, and played even better on ""Yessongs"".""And You and I"" is a beautiful piece which contains brilliant themes and brilliant touches.The side-long title suite has a lot in it, to include brilliant playing by the Squire/Bruford rhythm section. Great playing in the service of great composition."
2,"It is, but it isn't Grand Deveraux Style.","I can tell this is one of her earlier works, perhaps written before The Enchanted land, but published after it. And finally having gotten hold of a copy, I can see why it was allowed to go out of print.I'm glad to own a copy, and will probably never relinquish it, because I wanted the complete Deveraux collection, and this one marked its completion. However, I have to admit a serious disappointment, especially since I prefer her earlier works to her later ones.To forewarn all the romance fans--this is not a romance. It's a grand story of a woman who grows up and discovers herself, and a fantastic tale of the business she starts, but overall, it's rather drawn-out and the conclusion seems anti-climactic.Anyone who wants the complete collection should buy this, definitely, and even read it through, but I doubt it'll be a favorite."
4,NOT LIKE ANY OF HER MORE RECENT BOOKS.,"I WAS LUCKY TO FIND THIS BOOK IN MY LOCAL LIBRARY. I HAVE READ ALL OF JUDE DEVERAUX'S BOOKS (22) I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT FOREVER. IT IS NOT HER USUAL STYLE, BUT I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAD TO RATION IT OUT SO THAT I WOULD NOT RUSH THROUGH IT AND MISS SOMETHING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
2,Practice Makes Perfect,"Jude Deveraux's first book, to me, left a lot to be desired. As usual the description is wonderful, but the story was a bit lacking. The ending left me wnating more and trying to figure it out. Other of her novels, especially the historical ones seem to be the best."
3,An intereseting find from Jude Devereaux's past.,"If you can get a hold of this book, read it! It is not her best work, but you can see the talent. The story is good, but the total book is lacking her normal style."
2,A bit disappointing for a Jude Deveraux,"Too many characters are described, the title of the novel suits well.The one night weakness of the heroine is not something common we can find on other novels from Jude Deveraux."
3,casa okay,"the reviews have it! this book is most definitaly her first work. while i got the book to complete my collection, it is stilla good read for the lovers of that style (which for me is hard to describe)."
4,GOOD READING,"I'M A BIG FAN OF JUDE DEVERAUX, AND HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS. I RECENTLY DID A SEARCH OF HER WORKS AND CAME ACROSS THIS BOOK--WHICH I FOUND ON AMAZON, AND BOUGHT. IT WAS AN INTERESTING BOOK, WITH A GOOD STORY LINE."
4,Pure Magic!!,"I finally found this book and what a treat!! It gave me chills, literally!! I think Jude Deveraux knew what she was doing writing this. It takes you in touch with yourself, that part of you no one knows about. I really loved this book, can't you tell?! There are just too many wonderful things to say about it!! In fact, there are no words that can express what this book did to me."
5,"Light yet complete coverage, lovely!","tried this product thinking it would be like the other mineral foundations and powders I've tried, but was pleasantly surprised. I love the touted benefits of these products: healing your skin, preventing aging, SPF protection, etc.. but could never find one that didn't make me look like grandma with her pancake makeup (bless her heart). This one is a keeper. Made my skin look dewy yet flawless (meaning the coverage works!). And stayed on. I think my skin actually feels softer as well. No cons here. And the final clincher -- the price is so right."
5,my favorite,"The best mineral makeup that I have used so far. It's light, it covers well, and it doesn't become cake-y. Love it."
5,perfection,Did great for my oily skin....no break outs and wayyyy better than bare minerals in my opinion!! My go to!
1,product was not received,"i didn't receive the product from the seller however i bought it from the store and it was great, it looks like a second skin. very natural looking.the coverage is medium but its build-able."
2,Could Have Been OK,"The boots were delivered within reasonable time. The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear. Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price. There is however a defect I noted on the second day. There are small cracks, about 12, 1/4"" long each at the back of the right shoe. Photo sent. Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund. Unfortunately, I am based outside of US and cannot ship back using prepaid UPS provided. Could have been nice shoes."
2,Dissapointed,"Thought I was going to get the indicator shown in the picture along with the mag pot. Why would the indicator be shown in the picture if it is not included, very deceiving. Description of item at the bottom of page, says system of measurement, inch.. Thought this was referring to the indicator."
4,Soars high,"It says something of Ponty''s unquestioned electric violin domination when, decades later, his frenzied fusion still feels freshly innovative even on less received works."
5,The virtuoso continues to amaze,"Only Rick Wakeman can transform complex orchestral-rock compositions like ""And You and I"" and ""Major Tom"" into breathtaking demonstrations of piano virtuosity. Equally impressive are his passionate renderings of ""Morning has Broken"" and ""Wondrous Stories"". Anyone who appreciates extraordinary piano music on par with such greats as Franz Lizst and Rachmaninov will certainly enjoy this CD. Those of us who know and love Rick's music will find this an exceptional addition to our collections."
4,Very well done,"This is a really great flick. Fun, funny, definitely worth the watch! Writing is solid, directing and acting sells the concept."
5,This is #2 they tried harder,The groups 2nd album is too tight to believe.This is where the band was heading before adversity hit them. This is the album that put them on the map but it is NOT their first. Crazy phat horns (Malcolm and Roger) make you move buy this one even if you are not a collector and try to sit still through it (yea right)
4,Essential AWB (their second album),"It's hard to find a stronger one-two punch on any pop recording than AWB's 'You Got It' and 'Got the Love.' These two funk-pop tunes still sound fresh decades later, worthy of the repeat button in the car. Ironically, AWB is probably best known for its instrumental smash 'Pick Up the Pieces,' but the great mix of two lead vocalists (including Hamish Stuart's falsetto) really distinguished them to many 70s fans of all races. This 'white album' put them over the top but I believe rabid fans will confirm it was their second (the first LP didn't do any business in the States, at least). It's rated 4 stars here because of a couple of weak songs but it's still an essential buy, along with 'Soul Searching,' arguably their absolute finest work."
1,See for Yourself,"Length:: 0:17 MinsNo camera tricks. Watch before you buy.(Don't worry, I'm not naked in the faucet reflection.)"
1,fatally flawed design,"The weight of the faucet shuts the water off. You have to have it fully extended full blast or nothing. If you want to just turn the water on lightly, no luck with this faucet - the faucet handle will just slowly descend from it's own weight until your water shuts off. From a review I read elsewhere, apparently Price Pfister knows about this problem but is still selling this borderline useless product. Amazing."
2,Water everywhere!,"Same problem here. Handle's too heavy. Now husband wants to throttle me. Hey, I installed it! What's he crying about? Just because you have to have the water fully ON or the handle drops and shuts everything off... Jeez. There's the sponge! Wash those walls down, honey! Again!Won't buy Price Pfister again. PPf should recall this product or provide a free fix."
3,"Not bad, but has it's flaws","As it was mentioned in the previous review, this faucet indeed does have a design flaw. The handle is too heavy for the valve, so the water may be shut off by the handle descending by itself just because of it's weight. If this problem occurs, the only possible fix is to order an entirely new valve to replace the weak one. This is easy to do but having to deal with this is of course bothersome. On the plus side, I received the replacement valve from the manufacturer entirely free, after writing an email to Customer Service and explaining the issue. Otherwise, the faucet works fine and looks good. The included soap dispenser however is very cheaply made (all plastic) and the spout is short which may be an issue depending on the sink layout. Also, the rubber grommet / seal at the top of the dispenser spout tends to fall out, get lost and then the soap drips too easily after usage which leaves unsightly drops on the countertop or in the sink."
1,never buy price pfister again,"I bought at home depot about 3months ago, and the lever just drops down on its own unless you have the water full blast... I plan to just take back to home depot and buy another brand..I dont have the time to deal with a company that puts out product below par on the market. Also very bad design on mounting the faucet onto counter top..very tiny nut and hard to grab and tighten properly...stick to american standard or kholer brand...hope this helps"
2,Unsatisfactory replacement part,I bought this faucet as a replacement for the same model faucet. I had received good service from the original for about 6 or 7 years. The replacement soap dispenser was cheaply made and didn't work at all. The faucet was brushed chrome instead of the polished chrome I expected (the information on the faucet did not disclose that). And while the faucet works ok it tends to drip more than it should when turned off. I get the sense that it won't last long.
1,Price Pfister Single Handle Kitchen Faucet TOO HEAVY????,"I almost laughed at my plumber when he told me the reason my water shuts off on its own was because the handle was TOO HEAVY! Apparently, he wasn't lying to me. Many other Price Pfister owners have the same problem!Is it true? Is the reason my water turns off on me because the handle is too heavy? Wow, and does Price Pfister know this and still sell the item? More time and money spent on a faulty product!"
4,Response to the previous review,"I was having the exact same problem as the previous reviewer. No pressure, even though the pipes were fine. I took off the pull out, and found that if you check the back end of the pull out, there are (on mine, at least,) two cylindrical plastic inserts that have, I believe, a filtering/pressure reduction function. When I removed these, the pressure through the faucet was fine. These inserts are inside the pull-out, and you may have to run water back through the pull-out to get them out. (That's what I did.)"
1,dissapointed,"I was so excited when I remodeled my kithen and I found what I thought was the perfect faucet. It was the Price Pfister pull brushed stainless. Looked great. But pressure through this faucet sucks. I even exchanged the pull out thinking there was something wrong with it. I have cleaned the screens, nothing works....now I have to buy a new one to get enough pressure to wash down the sink. Pressure is so low the sprayer doesn't do anything but dribble."
1,what a total piece of garbage,"Bought this from Lowes. I didn't install it for a few months or it would have gone back to the store. I can't find a receipt, so it will just get thrown away. I could have saved a trip to the store and just thrown the money in the trash. And of course, it wasn't inexpensive, so you'd think it would be worth something. The hot water cuts out and unless the thing is turned up full blast, it turns itself off. I'm one of those quiet customers that will never buy another Price Pfister product again, and will tell everyone I know what crap this is..so congrats to this company..ya saved a few cents and lost another customer."
2,Faulty handle and dispenser,"Not counting for the current issue of having sprung a leak in the pull out faucet, we have had 2 major issues:1. The handle dropping down to the off position.2. The soap dispenser spitting out the rubber tip.For each of these issues, when we called Price Pfister, they sent replacement parts at no cost. The handle repair appears to have fixed the problem. The soap dispenser still spat out the rubber tip along with the soap when we dispensed soap, so we do not use the soap dispenser.I do feel the fact that they send the replacement parts under lifetime warranty is a boost in the positive direction. I'm not going to hold my breath on the most recent issue, but, if I get that part replaced at no cost, I will report back."
2,"Pfister offers free repair parts, but no recall of the product.","I've got the same floppy handle problem as many other posters. I've contacted Pfister and they just sent three new parts under warranty (a new ring, cartridge and handle). Faucets purchased after 1 January 1997 are covered by a lifetime warranty. The parts were easy to install.This is all thanks to the brick & mortar plumbing supply house I first called: they said ""we don't stock repair parts, but you can get them free from Pfister"".The faucet is still make for looks not function. It is floppy, does not turn off crisply, and feels cheap and wiggly."
3,Fantastic costumer service,I had a problem with the faucet handle falling down. I put a little shim in to make it stiffer and that work fine.I've called on a couple other parts that I needed replacing and their customer service is fantastic!
1,Don't bother,"Our family loves Bill Peet books, but we were disappointed at the strong anti-hunting message. The illustrations and story were just too much"
2,One dull book!,"I found this book to be wordy, uncreative and dull. As a mother of 5, I have read lots of children's books and usually enjoy a new one, but not this one. Very dull. I do not recomend this book and neither do my 6 and 3 year old."
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"I thought that this would be a move for us. We enjoy both birding and Steve Martin movies but when it ended, my wife and I just looked at each other and said, ""that was a disappointment"". The movie has little more than three guys running all around the country trying too hard in their own way to be funny when the situation often does not fit or support their effort. This is not a move that will be saved in our collection of moves."
4,An ornathologists dream,"This movie has a similar premise to Best in Show, only with birds. It was good for a couple of laughs."
5,Very good...worth the time,"I have to admit, I watched it because I like the guys in it..but I knew it was not a goofball movie. I have to say, I am not a ""Birder"" but I really, really enjoyed this movie. It is a sweet, funny movie, with a good message. Jack, Steve and Owen were perfectly cast, and the soundtrack is wonderful. I say it is worth an hour and half of your life."
5,Loved this movie!!!,This is one of my favortie movies now. I know a lot of birders that are just like this. It was hilarious and I wish they would make more movies like it!!
3,Mostly about these three guys,"I expected more photography of birds, birdwatching, and information on birds. The names of birds is said so quickly I couldn't understand some of the names."
4,Birders Delight,"Great little movie for those who love Steve Martin, Jack Black or Owen Wilson. Good story line for a night at home with your significant other. Doesn't require emotional commitment and is an easy going and laughable movie. Recommend it when you are looking for a good time."
