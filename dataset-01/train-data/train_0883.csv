4,Great for cycling too!,Can read my GPS through the bifocals while seeing the road through the smoke lenses. Used these for three years. Be careful not to lose the nose pads they can fall off easily. Tack them in place with some super glue. Durable and inexpensive.
3,glass for reading in the sun they do good for driving,they are to dark needs to be just a little lighter other then that they are ok they do fit nice
4,GOOD FOR OUTDOORS,"VERY GOOD PRODUCT,NO INTERFERENCE ,LIGHT WEIGHT AND DOES THE JOB.EASILY STAY IN PLACE WHEN NOT IN USE,QUITE DURABLE AND LIGHT."
4,nose cushions fall off,"Overall a good product. Bought 3 pair and they fit well, however, the nose pieces fall off and get lost. I put glue on them and they still get lost. They are not comfortable once the nose cushion is lost."
2,Great idea poor execution,"The basic idea of adding the bifocal lens to the glases is good and useful. However, in these glasses, the bifocal lens takes up way too much vertical field of view, so you are constantly looking through the bifocals when you don't want to, producing a slight blur to your vision. Consequently you find yourself making little 'adjustments' frequently - shifting your view up or down. After a while this is a pain in the neck."
4,DeWalt reader safety glasses - shaded,Good optics. Near perfect. Lite. Not tight on the eyes; lets them breathe in the heat/humidity. Not the sturdiest. Once a lens pops out; that is it. Fini
3,Small issue,"The nose pads slip easily. Might fall off and get lost. If your pair has same issue, put a drop of glue on it. Optically, these are as good as any safety glasses I've used."
3,Bifocal sunglasses,"This was a good price for these sunglasses but they were darker than I expected, one problem with ordering online, site unseen. They are everything they advertised however due to the dark tint, I get very little use out of them."
4,Bargain cycling/fishing sunglasss,"Great for cycling so I can actually read my watch,speedometer and cell phone without packing my reading glasses.Great for changing fishing lures and fixing line tangles.Cheap enough not to mourn their loss. Buy two at a time."
3,Dewalt bifocal,"Inexpensive, reasonably looking for social setting. Not as durable as I would like. Without a strong case I broke a lense when they were in my cargo shorts pocket. But, at this price I had purchased two pair. The second pair I now keep in a crush resistant case."
5,"Love them, great price","Great bifocal sun glasses. They work well and I've used them quite a bit in outdoor work where I need to read without having to take off my glasses. They are plenty dark for my uses; and the price is right. These are plastic, so I can see where they might break (has not happened so far). I bought extras of these since they are indispensable to me. I would not want to be without them. They have a fabric sleeve, which is good enough to prevent scratches in a pocket, but you may want a hard shell case (these are all plastics glasses) for travel or if stowed with other gear or tools."
4,Dewalt Reinforcer RX-Bifocal 2.5 Smoke Lens,Very happy with these glasses. I use them for sun glasses and when driving the car it makes reading the instrument panel much easier.
3,Bifocal Sunglasses,They fit great but the nose rests came off and disappeared and they don't come with any spares and Dewalt doesn't offer any customer support. Too bad because I like the coverage
4,Bifocal Safety Googles = Bifocal Sunglasses,"These are nice glasses, and I'm a believer in safety glasses, but I have three pairs because bifocal safety glasses are less than $15 and bifocal sunglasses are more than $25.I'm old enough now that if I want to read a map or even a GPS when driving I need to put on my glasses. Bifocals are better and these are a cost effective solution. I have a clear pair as well.Dewalt makes nice ones. The bifocal lens is big enough to read with, but small and low enough that it's not in the way for driving."
3,ok but distorted,"The glasses are ok, but once I compared to other safety glasses, I realized they were a little distorted on the non-bifocal areas. It was ok, but they will be my backup from now on. Also, after 3 days of wearing, one of the nose guards fell off. I had ordered a clear pair, so I used one of those. Not the quality I would expect from Dewalt. They did look cool though."
2,"Great Idea, poor execution",These glasses are a great idea; bifocals allow reading in the sun or viewing dash instruments while driving. But frames are quite large and do not stay on your head like Oakley's or other quality sunglasses.
5,perfect for an outdoors person,"I bought this for my husband, also got one for myself w/ a diff. rx #, He was not sure about them...he loves them, and have become his favor pair...great price and good quality....."
4,Dewalt DPG59 as sunglass,I use the Dewalt DPG59 as sunglasses to drive and play golf. They work find in the bright sun here in FL.
3,Disgusted by shipping charges,These glasses were fine. It's the $2.01 1 GB SD card that I bought 4 of from you and you charged $5.37 EACH to ship. Total weight was about 4 ounces. You're criminals. I'm done with Amazon.
4,Man size glasses,"Great in every way; except way too big for my face. Over 5 7/8"" across hinge points. Won't fit inside my motorcycle helmet, either. If you're my size check out BearKats."
5,Best. Bifocals. Ever.,"I've owned a couple pairs of these (as my eyes have deteriorated, alas), and I think they're by far the best bifocals I own. The dark lenses work perfectly as sunglasses; the light lenses are fine for indoor use and reading. They're cheap, last a long time, and don't look like Tottering Old Man Glasses. I can wear them in the gym and look positively dangerous, until I peer at the screen on the elliptical. Where's that darned cross-train function?"
3,Okay glasses,"Wanted something to read at the pool and beach. These glasses fulfill that need, though I'm worried they may not be sturdy enough to handle more than this season."
4,Great when used with chums like retainer,"I like these and wear them frequently. Best for me with a chums like retainer, so you can quickly let them dangle from your neck out of the way. there is a bit of annoyance at times with the division line between the 2.0 magnification line and regular lens as others have stated. I would prefer they be polarized as well."
5,Excellent product!!!,"I love these sunglasses. I use them for running, driving and working around the yard. They have replaced my Ray Bans as my main sunglasses. I also bought a pair of Apex Bifocal Safety Glasses UV400 Magnifying Reading Eyewear 2.00 Magnifier which I paid $4.00 more for and hardly ever wear. The Dewalt brand is the one to buy."
2,not polarized,"Felt comfortable,tint about right,magnification in correct area,good fit for a medium size head & the only thing they are not polarized so they don't remove very much glare and clarity on the lake isn't very good."
3,Works but feel Cheap,Got these for my road bike and the ability to see my GPS when riding.Overall they work for this application as you are looking up when riding so the issue that some others have noted of the magnification part of the lens being to big is not an issue for me.They do feel cheap rather like the $5 ones you get at the flea market then again they are inexpensive so I guess that is a mute point.No case just an unusable foam type sleeveBut as I said for knocking around on the bike they work fine and if they do break are cheap enough to replace.
5,Show Boat - 1993 Revival CD,This is a great album - purchased second-hand but in wonderful condition with no damage and booklet intact. The 1993 revival has updated arrangements and a couple of new songs added - WHY DO I LOVE YOU has been given to Parthy to sing (I'm guessing as a vehicle for Elaine Strich as otherwise Parth doesn't get a solo) and it works well. All in all - a worthwhile update of a classic musical that makes great listening!
3,Very good 2fer,"While the songwriting on Dave's solo work never really matched his best work with the Kinks, Dave Davies/Glamour is a pretty good summation of Dave's strong and weak points. The first album DD has the better songs and doesn't revel in the bombastic heavy metal cliches that would characterize some of his later solo work.Glamour, on the other hand, suffers from weaker songwriting and more heavy handed production. While the highlights of this second album are many they are equal to the lowpoints. This makes the second album a wash. Still, it's nice to have both these albums in print after a long period where they weren't available at all.DD gets 4 stars while Glamour gets 3. The Anthology retrospective is a better place for new Kinks fans to begin while this 2fer is essential for long time fans."
3,"Its the music, not the singer.","Moore's voice is definitely not bad, but in this case, its all about the music. The Arab beat, the melody is what cuts it here, not the lyrics. Which is why the Thunderpuss remix, in this case - is alright and doesn't bring much to the table. I applaud whoever produced this song, a blend of Shakira, Ofra Haza and bubble-gum pop."
5,Mandy Moore + THUNDERPUSS = HOT Club Mix,"What can I say, I love pop music, and I really love the direction that Mandy went with this song. It has a middle eastern sound to it that really works here. However, take this song and give it to THUNDERPUSS to remix you get one hot club mix. I my opinion the In My Pocket THUNDERPUSS Club Mix is one of their best mixes to date, I absolutely love it!! If you love pop music, if you love club music, and if you love THUNDERPUSS, you need this cd!!"
3,A no frills mp3 to home audio adapter cable,This is just a garden variety adapter to connect a mp3 player to the aux input on a home stereo system. It does what it is designed to do.Look locally for this item first because the shipping will make the total cost a little steep.
3,Good coverage of JMX basics but not much on practicle usage,This book covers the fundamentals of JMX but where I was disappointed was that it uses a pretty basic queue example and doesn't really get into J2EE applications and praticle uses. I was left wondering when to use it. If I had it to do over I'd choose another book with more praticle applications for JMX.
4,"""West Coast's Mobb Deep""","I'd like 2 start by mentioning that these 2 rappers have the same name as their eastcoast counterparts - ""Mobb Deep"", which consists of Havoc & Prodigy. Also, if you check out Mobb Deep's album release dates, you'll notice that they're almost exactly identical to South Central Cartel's. I have no idea what the reasoning behind this is.Now, about the album, I rated it 4 stars, but it's closer to 3 1/2. The standout tracks are 1) Truez Neva Stop, 5) Bump, & 16) Capable of Murder. ""Bump"" alone is a reason to get this album - check out the sound clip Amazon posted. Besides the tracks I listed, the others are all decent. This album comes close to SCC's ""All Day Everyday"", but lacks the rest of the group's input. If you like SCC, this album is a must. Don't skip on this just because it features only 1/2 of SCC."
4,Great performances,"Karajan in ConcertThis is a great collection of peformances by the late maestro. I have always preferred his performances with the Berlin orchestra of those he did with Vienna (sometimes of the very same work).There is a down side which is why this set gets 4 stars rather than 5; there are some performances missing. Most of these were originally released in the US and Europe on laserdisc while the Orient had laserdisc and a version on Video CD. What is missing is Bizet's selections from ""L'Arlesienne"" Suite and Weissenberg's Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto #1. Actually, by all rights, the Tchaikovsky should have been included with his disc of Tchaikovsky's last 3 symphonies. It's omission is puzzling, but since they included the Rachmaninov Second, there was plenty of room to include the Tchaikovsky."
2,Great Little Bulletin,"This is a straightforward, easy to understand, basic primer on the hatching of eggs. However, you are not going to get all the information you need from this 4 page bulletin. For example, it only addresses poultry/fowl, so don't look to it for breeding reptiles. Also, for artificial incubation of birds. there is no species specific information such as temperature requirements. ONE BIG CAVEAT: This is not a book. It is a bulletin that is available to download for free or for purchase @ $.50. Just google the title. That's what I did."
4,"Good Cookin, Good Eating","There are alot of easy recipes in this book, I have tried many of them. Down home food no matter where your home is. It is not only easy to follow but there are candid stories about how some of the recipes came about. This one stays on the counter."
2,"well written, but not for me","I got this book hoping to read about the science behind grains and how our bodies process them. (I have been trying to eat healthier) This book advocates a lot of junk food surprisingly, and it geared entirely to celiac disease. I was under the impression that it would be good for anyone just thinking about giving up grains, but it was not. I only gave this 2 stars because I didn't like it, if you have celiac disease and do not want to eat a raw food diet, than you would like it more."
4,good for celiac,"I have an interesting situation where I am allergic to gluten, corn, white potatoes...this book only addresses Wheat - and many of the alternative foods they suggest are corn and potatoes. So it is useful in the sense that if you only have wheat allergies then it's a great reference. If you have other stuff going on I wouldn't suggest it."
5,excellent,great for those who have an allergy to gluten. I just bought the wrong book that's all. But great information.
5,Wheat Free Worry Free,This book should be required reading for all medical doctors to prevent years of unnecessary suffering for yet-to-be-diagnosed Celiacs. I wish I had been told about this wonderful resource at the time my daughter was been diagnosed. It is the best source of information on Celiac Disease that I have found.
1,Waste of time,"Not only did this not give the water pressure expected, but the whole buying process was a pain. From the start when orderng off thier website, it won't let you just complete the order. I must have gotten 10 additional pages of ""buy this, buy that, this would be a good accessory."" Just let me order the thing. Then once they got my card number, with in 2 days I had 3 phone calls ""confirming my order"" then signing me up for 30 day trails of other stuff which I would have to call and cancel. Then a month later the order was put in and I got it. If you do get one, find it in a store, DO NOT ORDER OFF THIER WEBSITE!!!!!"
1,save your money,I bought one of these and took it back the next day. Target sells these now as does walgreens. Low water pressure is the problem. I can go to Lowes or the hardware store and buy a brass plug and drill a hole in it and out it on the end of my hose and get the same result as this item for a few dollars.
1,DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR,"I bought the Water Jet Power Washer, hoping that it would replace my big power washer.NO WAY! If you read other negative reviews, regarding this product, BELIEVE THEM!This product is garbage. SAVE YOUR MONEY, and buy an electric power washer.If this product was selling for a dollar, it would be a dollar wasted!"
3,Okay,"Seller shipped item very fast and on time.I wanted to give it a try to see if it matched the commercial I saw about it. It is helpful, and I will use it, but it is just not as powerful as I hoped it would be."
1,Nothing but garbage.,"There is nothing in this product worth feeding to a cat. It will make your cat dull, fat, unhealthy, and sleepy. Look at the ingredients and notice how much corn and other grain materials there are and not much real meat. Look at the ingredients in pet food and avoid corn and wheat and by products. Try Innova Evo, it is the best food there is."
2,not the original formula as stated,This is not the original formula as the ad states. It is the new meaty selections formula which both our cats appear to be allergic to. It is the small flat pieces not the large round bits like they used to be. Unfortunately the bag was also opened upon delivery so I really couldn't return it. The local strays got a treat............
4,Loved in this house!,"I have one cat that is totally all things Whiskas! I bought her a bag of this on a whim and gave it to her the same time I gave her some wet food. It was quite amusing to see her go from one bowl to the next, trying to decide which to eat first! She grabbed some wet, went to this, went back grabbed more wet, back to this, it was quite comical! She loves the taste of this dry food, however, it's terribly hard for her to eat it. The kibble is quite large and I'm trying to figure out if the makers thought they were making this for dogs! She mostly has to swallow it whole unless I put some in a plastic baggy and whack it with a hammer. They're just too stiff to snap in half with your fingers.Other than that, I do recommend this, but if your cat has a small mouth like mine, you might want to try something else. She likes it so much that I keep giving it to her, but I'm still trying to find ways to help her eat it."
2,"Good book,a bit porny (or erotic novelly perhaps)","It is good, particularily with the millitary and magic systems. The first person POV leaves you less then surprised that the main characters going to live through everything.That and Damastes EPIC FORESHADWING of the future betrayal. Meaning it pops up and hits you like a brick every fifty to hundred pages (possibly less).Then theres the sex scenes that just pop up. Didn't surprise me much as it seemed a bit GRRM, with less pretense.A quick read with few surprises and not too bad."
4,Flawed . . . but worthwhile,"Overall, a well-written fantasy novel; refreshingly refrains from being either an ""epic"" or a ""romantic fantasy. Two flaws drag it down it somewhat. First is the narrative style, first person from the end of the story -- which we're told in the first few pages. (There are also an annoyingly large number of gloom-and-doom predictions that don't seem to quite bear themselves out, in the main body of the text.) Second is the overly graphic nature of the sex scenes; they don't match the tone of the rest of the novel, and I found them distracting.Don't let this stop you from reading the novel, though."
2,Drivel,"If you enjoy reading detailed histories of military actions, then this book is certainly for you - especially if your field of pleasure is military action prior to the 18th Century. The detailed description of military life, strategy and battle may suit you down to the teeth.That being said, however, I must confess that I found this book excruciatingly boring. In my 42 years, I have only left two books unfinished, regardless of how poorly written; had I not felt obligated to finish this one, in order to write a fair review, this would have been the third. Go to http://www.fantasylink.com for the full review"
3,"Good, not Great","This is a servicable guitar stand. It get's the job done. I use it for 2 acoustic guitars. It is well balanced and doesn't want to tip over when there is only one guitar on it. It breaks down easily and can fit in my gig bag which is nice. The biggest problem with it is the head stocks tend to bang into each other when both guitars are on it. It just takes a little maneuvering.I would recommend it though. It's inexpensive, seems durable and as I said before, gets the job done."
3,"Absolute page turner, but then a disappointing ending","The beginning of the book was so good, I raced through it. The emotions, the desire - all made for a wonderful story! But then it turned into a typical story of innocent man accused of murder. I don't happen to like those. I felt Lady Diana never truly accepted Jared. Although he forgave her over and over, she showed her distrust of him time after time. If I were Jared, I think I would have given up on her! Still, it was a well written book. The characters acted mature and were believable. I was not all that sympathetic to Lady Diana but I understood her. A good afternoon's read."
4,Glenn Miller - Greatest Hits,I was a little disappointed in the music that was selected. Could have had more of his most popular hits.
4,I sure hope I dont wear it out.,"The nice thing about this CD is that it has perhaps ""all"" of Glenn Miller's greatest hits. A lot of greatest hits CD are a far cry from the title. This one is not. This is the real thing. I could listen to ""Chattanooga Cho Cho"" all day and ""In the Mood"" all night."
5,Great for music-on-hold!,"We recently added music-on-hold on our phone system, and this is one CD we purchased for it. It has received LOTS of compliments. Great background music, or even house-cleaning music!"
1,review for MP3 album only,The MP3 album download is a totally different track list. The tracks are not the standards that you're looking for.
5,Blind Man on a Flying Horse,I have been looking for this album for YEARS after loaning the record (thats how long ago it was) to a friend and never getting it back. Thrilled thrilled thrilled to have got it again - thanks
3,Eclectic mix of styles,"I had to let this album grow on me, but with a few listens it did. I looked for the album after hearing ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" on the movie, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"". I like the Irish flavor of penny-whistle, etc, and love the female singer's voice. A few really strong tunes, a few I tend to skip, but a nice and different addition to my collection."
3,Buy the Soundtrack,"If you are looking for the song ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" from the movie ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" buy the movie soundtrack. The Tin's CD has two versions of the song but neither comes close in richness and quality to the movie version."
3,World's Slowest Phone,"I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone. This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.The menu pops up after 3 secondsThe picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it."
5,Nokia 6600-Best phone so far...,The Nokia 6600 is so far the best phone ive ever had its much better than the Motorola MPX200 and its a very easy phone to use i would recomend this phone to anyone who likes the fratures of the Ipaq and the Reception of T-Mobile.. heres some Pros and Cons of the Nokia 6600..Pros-1. The bluetooth is great nice range and pretty fast2. The infered is nice Very Fast3. Its pretty durable and its fast4. The screen is GREAT5. The Symbian OS is very east to use and its menues are convient6. The Battery life isnt as bad as people say... to be frank it is accually quite good7. The camera is quite nice and good resolution8. THE SD MEMORY SLOT IS AMAZING GET A 1GB SD CARD AND FILL IT WITH UR MAVORITE SONGS AND MOVIES9. The contacts are easy to manage10. The phone works as a modem11. This PHONE HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AT A GOOD PRICE GET IT (...)Cons-1. The price is a little bit steap.. thats it
5,Seriously an awesome phone!!!,"I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.3. Play Java games on it.4. Play N-Gage games on it.5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!As for bluetooth, no problems at all. I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155. Very simple and painless."
5,Excellent phone,"Although this is my first mobile phone, this is an Excellent phone that has almost all features that anybody can expect in normal mobile phone. I am really impressed with the Quality of this phone."
4,Good cell phone,This is the best camera cell phone that ive ever had..the camera quality is really good..speaker phone is loud but not as much as the nokia 6610..i recomend this phone to buyers for its price..the bad thing is that videos can be recorded for only 10seconds although there is a 32mb memory card included..that doesnt make sense i dont know why i cant take videos longer than 10 seconds
4,Pretty good,While the buttons are too close together causing me to hit the wrong key and its a bit slow - its a good phone. No real problems. It seems it's being discontinued - so what...
2,i dont believe it is nokia,"i bought this phone 16 months ago i had a lot of problems with that phone , i can not call (because it says call not allowed ,it happens 10-15 times in a day), it doesnt show your recent call logs (sometimes),if u drop it on ground it takes big damages(too soft body),etcgood sides battery life,and looks nice ,and lots of system tools"
2,Not that great,Nokia had good reputation but this phone brought it down. The battery doesn't stay as mentioned in specification. The Camera is not that great.
3,Amazon Cheats,"According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COMBut if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake. I have ordered 2 ""cell phone + service""s from Amazon. The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it. The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that ""Can be delayed further"". So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,"
5,nokia 6600 digital camera,"General Network GSM 900 / GSM 1800 / GSM 1900Announced 2003, 4QStatus AvailableSize Dimensions 109 x 58 x 24 mm, 113ccWeight 122 gDisplay Type TFT, 65k colorsSize 176 x 208 pixels- 5-way joystick navigation- Selectable themesOptional Ringtones In shared memoryVibration In phoneLanguages Major Europe and Asia-Pacific- Polyphonic ringtones- Photo phonebook- Build-in handsfree- User groupsMemory Numbers in phone 8 fields, in memCall records Unlimited- 6 MB shared memory- MMC card slot, 32 Mb card included- ARM9 CPU, 104 MHz- 25 voice command slots- Voice memoFeatures GPRS Class 4 (3+1 slots)Data speed 24 - 36 kbpsMessaging SMS, MMS, EmailClock YesAlarm YesInfrared port YesGames Yes, downloadableColors Light Gray- Digital camera (640x480)- Video capture- Mono audio player- Bluetooth- Java MIDP 2.0- Series 60 UI- Symbian OS 7.0s- WAP 2.0- xHTML browser- T9Battery performanceStand-by Talk timeStandard battery, Li-Ion 850 mAh 150 h - 240 h 2 h - 4 h"
4,Great phone!,"Beautiful screen, nice dimensions, found it very easy to set up and use (This is my first Nokia).The speakerphone option seems quite good as well.The minor worries are -- Protecting the screen effectively from scratching- Keys are a bit on the smaller side (Too much typing is not comfortable)Overall, absolutely a great buy."
2,I own shoehorns with better Bluetooth implementations,"This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer). My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web, you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots, this phone will probably satisfy you. If you need Bluetooth, stay away."
2,Unforgivably Slow Menus,I have been using the phone for 4 months now and find the menus too slow to respond. You practically hit the call button and wait for it to display the call history. The software is too slow to respond. Most of the features in the phone arent useful at all. The keys are pretty good but other than that I really didnt like it at all.
4,Screen is easily scratched,"Overall a great phone. However, the screen is easily scratched. If you purchase this phone, leave plastic protector on screen, until you purchase a protective case. My screen was scratched within a week."
4,"Nice Phone, Great Features","Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features. I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes. Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder. Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting. Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth."
4,"Great phone, but buyer beware of so-called TMobile rebate.","This phone is fantastic. Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others). Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate. T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate."
4,Big Fatty does a decent job,"The Nokia 6600 has a colorful screen with easy to use menus. The battery life is okay with a lithium-ion battery. You can change out the face plates if you get sick of the color you currently have and you can store multiple phone numbers per contact name in addition to some other details such as address, company, etc. The downside of this phone is it's big/fat and the loading of some menu options can be slow. However, it is a sturdy phone and if compared to other 'smart phones' it does a decent job. ;-) I am replacing my new razr with this one since my razr was a total lemon."
4,NOKIA is the best,I have been a fan of Nokia since a long time. This is my fifth Nokia so far. This phone has an awesome screen and a nice camera (better than any I have seen ever in a cell phone). The only drawback is if you install themes it tends to get slower. The connectivity and other features worked smoothly for me. All in all a phone worth buying. To be quiet honest this is the best available in US Market right now.
4,Excellent but Bulky,"The phone is excellent with great features. Apart from being bulky, I did not find anything wrong in the phone."
2,Good and Bad,"Positives: Bluetooth, IR port, VGA Camera, multiple e-mail accounts, speaker phone, more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S. I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives: phone too big; voice recognition worthless, low volume from ear piece, IR port weak so TV remote control programs don't work well, slow menu's and response. Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you (Opera has problems on this phone, but works most of the time). T-Mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few seconds, although Nokia made it adjustable, and T-Mobile won't fix it."
1,"as big as a shoe, won't work with Palm",The title pretty much says it all. The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
5,Has everything. more than anybody needs....,"This phone may seem alittle bit dummy but the features it hasis magnificent. With the price of $ -30 nobody can beat this deal. Symbian OS gives unlimited abilities to this phone. If you have a little bit knowledge you can use this phone as a PDA, mp3 player, portable movie player, unlimited voice and video recorder, portable gaming machine, fax machine, digital camera, GPS, and by the way cell phone."
3,Bulky - Lousy customer service,The cell phone itself has many features so its good if you want to use it for other purposes besides just making and receiving calls.Watch out for Amazon's rebates though. Its hard to get your mail-in rebate from Amazon and they do not accept any responsibility because they have contracted this department to a third party.
2,Not as what I expected...,"This phone was DOA when I got it. Amazon sent out another one(right away, with next day UPS!!!), The second phone I received, dead pixel found on LCD screen....Am I bad luck or what????Then, I used it to take some pics, the resolutions was not as what I expected!!!!However, the sound quality is superior!!! I love the RealOne player built-in to the phone(Just only play Mp4, will not play MP3). Also, it comes with the digital voice recoder, which I think is handy."
4,Another Great Nokia Phone!!!,"I bought two of these phones - one for my wife and one for me. I signed up for the T-Mobile 1K + Nights and Weekends. First of all T-Mobile's people at customer service were great even the people who helped me port my old number over.The Phone is great!!! I found the signal and sound quality to be great, however, I found the menus to be a little counter-intuitive. Not as bad as Motorola, but not typical Nokia. The phone fits the hand well and works well in noisy areas. It uses the same charger that I used for for 252 back in 1998!!!"
3,Good but S-L-O-W,"I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone. It's important that people know the following:First, the interface is slow. You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu. Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go. The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness. The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone."
3,It's an ok show,"The Rock the Nation concert was pretty good, I sure like the set list and the show over all. I would say my only suprise was how Pauls voice sounds during the first half of the concert. I remember thinking as I watched it, he must be recovering from a cold or something, because he sure sounds like he's having a hard time with those high notes.But as a true KISS fan I'm glad I bought it, but I can't say it's the best DVD they put out."
2,The cover band formerly known as KISS...,"I was a kiss fan for thirty years, but now I have had enough! Between Gene's two faced money grabbing, and the fact that Kiss has been re-releasing virtually the same set list now for over ten years I am done. You want my money Gene? Try putting something new out. New as in music, not bath soap or Kiss razor blades. I think the reason they don't is because they can't. (just give Gene's latest solo album a listen and you will see what I mean.) Give me something new or get lost. I gave this two stars one for Ace and one for Peter, because they remind me of when Kiss was truly the greatest band on earth! this Dvd however is more of the same worthless, played out [...].Oh by the way there is something I noticed on this DVD no Kiss fan has seem before...EMPTY SEATS."
2,HORRIBLE EDITING the ruined a good show!,"what a real shame! Filmed in High Deff and mixed in 5.1 audio, but the editing is almost as bad as that Kiss in Las Vegas DVD! You can't watch any angel for more than 4 seconds before they cut to a new angel! It's a joke!What has gotten into this modern film making where they assume the audience must have ADD! You cant kick back and enjoy a great show, they have to show you all the camera's and do it in every 4 seconds! This is just Crap!Get Kissology 3 for good shows with good editing.One comment on this ""new"" Kiss lineup...To dress up Thayer and Singer as Peter Criss and Ace Frehely....I dont know.I'd rather see Ace and Peter and hear/see them perform some of their hits, but it is what it is...Thayer and Singer or top notch guys, Singer does do ""Black Diamond"" and a very good job at it, I wish they let him and Thayer do other Peter and Ace songs, I mean they are wearing their costumes, might as well."
3,Should Go In Style,"ok people , as paul would say .ha . i bet peter and ace are laughing so hard at these reviews . well musically and visually still shows kiss can keep the jam going . paul needs to settle down and stop leading cheerleader chants and beggging the people to make noise , concentrate on saving his voice for the high notes . She , Unholy , Love Gun . Got To Choose the better songs on this . paul need to stop is yodeling . WOHOHOHOHOOOOOOOO . Me and a friend laughed so hard at paul at the end of I Want You .... As for kiss and their members and their makeup , last thing kiss ought to do , is get all remaining members . paul , gene , ace , vinnie , eric singer ,tommy, mark , bruce , peter and do the ultimate kiss farewell tour , do alot of rare songs , feature everyone , have a good rock n roll party on the way out . no more replacements could be handled . if my idea is used GENE . I WANT PROFITS .. GT"
4,Great Show,Excellent sound and picture quality. Not as many hits as I would have liked. Check out the song list.
5,Great!!!,"In 2004 Kiss came to the last place on Earth, you know, the south border for the first time. They came to Laredo and Hidalgo in Texas. At last my dream came true. I'm from Laredo and never thought they would come one day. It was august 12th, I still remember. No the original line-up, but their music and the way they make concerts is what matters. Paul Stanley, Gene Simmond, Eric Singer & Tommy Thayer. When I watch this video I travel to that day. Just for ""Tears are Falling"", that's the differnce. They played ""Psycho Circus"" in that concert instead. But everything else is just the same."
4,ROCK THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I attended the milwaukee,wi concert and seeing this video made me think I was there again! Only problem I had was there was too much panning out across the crowd..... If you haven't seen KISS in concert before...You dont know what your missing!"
1,I AM A KISS FAN.,"Poor. All of the tempos sound the same, the vocals are bad. And I'm not into people ""dressing"" up like Peter and Ace. Come on guys. Take the make-up off and ROCK!"
1,Cue snoring sounds....,"Wake me up when Gene the huckster decides to release some vintage era concerts on DVD. If I wanted to see a KISS cover band I could go to a local bar and pay $5 instead of $20 for this garbage. Everyone that touts Eric and Tommy's superior playing are missing the point. Its about playing with feeling and emotion. If I want technical proficiency I will listen to Rush, Yes, etc. KISS have never been about superior musicianship. I'm suprised Gene didnt include some hair from his wig and raise the price to $250 so that all of the die hards could help build another wing on his mansion. Whats next a KISS coffin.....oh wait!!!!!"
1,It's not out yet!,How can you give a review to something you haven't even looked at yet? So let's balance out this review rating...
3,"It's not out yet, but...","I have been to the show. Having seen them in both 82 and 92, where they completely blew the audience away, I was very disappointed with the ""Rock The Nation"" tour. Back in the non-makeup era they had to rely on themselves to make the fireworks, they were struggling to define themselves and they TRIED. Last time round, it was KISS by the numbers, and even with Eric on drums (he was brilliant on the ""Revenge"" tour!) they never really caught fire the whole night. I'll still buy it though, because some loyalties don't go away. If you're not a fan-for-27-years type though, I'd recommend the ""Symphony"" DVD instead - shows what they can do if they try. Just cover your ears during ""Great Expectations""..."
5,KISS does it again!!!,"Ladies and gentleman turn on your DVD players!!! KISS has done it again! I just received the DVD (12-12-05), all I could say is,""Job well done"". First, the packaging is first class and second the powervision feature is excellent. Ace and Peter I hate to say this but your replacements are outstanding. Tom and Eric do not miss a beat. The Songs line-up is great. This is by far their best DVD. ""Rock & Roll All Night and Party into Eternity"".Do not hesitate. Get this DVD today! Amazon.com, thank you for the great price and fast delivery."
5,I absolutely love this concert DVD,"This concert is absolutely incredible! I saw KISS the first time in 1977 when AC/DC (with Bon Scott) was their back-up band, and I was skeptical about this concert DVD because Peter and Ace weren't there, but I was so blown away by Tommy and Eric!! This concert is worth far more than the price! I've watched it five times in the last three days!! It's so refreshing after watching these so-called ""rock stars"" today like Britney Spears and Chris Brown who are nothing but lip-syncing gymnastsl!! KISS are the best MUSICIANS ever!"
2,Falta crudeza,"Soy fan de Kiss de toda la vida.Han hecho cosas mejores.El repertorio está bien,pero le falta crudeza.Hay que verlo por ""cultura general"".Está muy limpio,le falta fuerza.La verdad no me gustó.De todas formas seré fan de Kiss hasta la muerte."
4,Get over Ace and Peter,"I like the original band as much as everyone else. But lets face it, Peter cant play drums anymore & Ace cant play his guitar that great anymore. Eric and Tommy are so much better. I've seen both shows with ace & Peter and with Eric & Tommy. Eric and Tommy win hands down. Although I agree they should cut some new music. As for the makeup, who cares. Leave it on, take it off. Dosen't matter to me. I am in it for the songs (Gasp). Yes it's true, I like KISS for the music."
2,People are you going deaf?,"A lot reviews keep saying that this DVD has great audio. Come off it, this stinks!!! I'm a kiss fan and always have been, but I would be embarrassed for nonkiss friends to hear this. This concert doesn't have a solid sound; in fact sometimes it sounds disorganized. Just compare this mess to AC/DC ""Stiff upper lip live"". Now that's a concert! All the theatrics and great camera work in the world can not make up for a lousy sound, but that's why I gave it one extra star."
1,You Wanted The Best...You Got The Worst!,"WARNING!!! This DVD sucks! I give it a star just for production quality...nothing else!!! Obviously by now, greed for money and power have taken the best of Gene and Paul. Their ego went too far this time by stealing Ace and Peter's stage persona. Who wants to see other guys dressed up as KISS anyway. I see that enough during halloween, HA HA HA! That's too bad. This move was unnecessary and distracting enough to ruin the whole show for me. Actually, it would've been way better if they had no makeup at all.After reading a lot of these previous positive fan reviews I understand now. If you have no respect for yourself and like KISS just for tradition, be like these other suckers and get this DVD, HA HA HA!!!"
4,pretty good,"Overall, a pretty good DVD. Theres alot of rare songs that the band hasn't played for a while. And I will agree with some, it would be great to have Ace and Peter, but give Eric and Tommy their props. They are both unbelievable musicians and do a great job replacing Ace and Peter. Honestly, I like the Alive IV:Symphony DVD better than this, but it is still a great DVD and is worth the money."
5,AWESOME Kids MOMS in the KISS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was really cool!!!!!!!For anyone who wasn't able to make the show GREAT DVD to buy! Coolest of all I,m in it!!!!AWESOME!!! It's great,it's clean and tastefully done so I can show it off to my kids,and they can show it off to all of their friends.They blew Virgina Beach away and after watching the DVD,just makes me want more KISS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!"
1,KISS-OFF,"Let me start by saying I love KISS! There it's out of the way... Now about Rock The Nation Live: This is video attempts to bring all the energy of a live KISS concert to the home viewer by employing multiple ( and I mean MULTIPLE!!) cameras to record every aspect of the concert. What The viewer actually gets is an editor gone wild in the cutting room! There is barely a shot that is longer than 5 seconds long of any band member at any given time, unless you use the feature that follows individual members of the band. Add to the problem the fact that there are more shots of the audience than there are of the band and you get real tired real fast. Skip this DVD, you'll find better shows on YouTube."
3,AT IT AGAIN,"I have been a Kiss fan since 1978 when my uncle bought me Gene's solo album. After that I bought Alive and then began collecting everything I could get my hands on. I saw my first concert in 85 for the Asylum tour and the first video I saw was Live: Uncensored. Those were the good days. Once Kiss removed the make up, they entered a different realm and should have remained there. There style shifted with the trends, but that was ok. I admit I was slightly dissapointed when they put the make up back on but still remained a fan. The ""Rock the Nation"" DVD should have been filmed with all original members and not this way. Singer and Thayer are awesome, but they are not Ace and Peter. Although this DVD illustrates that these guys still have it, it is a slight dissapointment to the original fan base and shows that they are still marketing the name Kiss and not considering what true Kiss fans really want to see. If you are gonna wear the makeup, you need to have peter and ace."
1,Helping to balence this out,"Agree with the latest 2 reviews. Let's stop giving 5 stars to everything just because you like the band! What if this DVD sucks, the sound quality is poor, etc?! There are DVDs from bands that I just love that are terrible, and I gave them 1 or 2 stars!A tip for those who look at the reviews before buying, read only the bad reviews, with 1 or 2 stars. Those are the good ones to understand what is not good on a product and see if those bad things make you give up buying it. 5 stars reviews are always ""this band rocks"" ""I love her.."" and that kind of s***"
3,It's a shame,"I have been and always will be a KISS fan, but this DVD is just a shame. First off, It's not really KISS. I had hoped that at some point a DVD would be released of the Farewell Tour with Ace and Peter, but sadly, it looks like that will probably never happen. They also should have made Alive IV from the Farewell Tour. (Which, by the way, should have been exactly what they said it would be. ""The Farewell Tour""!) I could go on about that for quite a while though. The point is that I bought this DVD because I am a completist. Unfortunately, this DVD just bored me. I have had it since it was released and have only made it through about 75% of the first disc. I just haven't felt like watching it anymore. It just seems phony to me.Lets all hope that someday, they will release an official DVD of the Farewell Tour or The Reunion Tour or even The Psycho Circus Tour."
3,Great showmanship,"The only knock against this DVD would be the fact that Ace Frehley is not in the mix. Anyone can do a better job than Peter Criss but Ace is sorely missed at lead guitar. Also where is ""Do you love me""? and ""Black Diamond""? Otherwise great audio and visual but I would rather have closeups of Ace throwing licks rather than Tommy Thayer."
1,Save your money...,"I was at a one of these pathetic ""Kiss"" shows in 04 and I wanted to go home after the first 2 minutes. Wanna waste your money on imposters? Be my guest. Second Coming is a much better bet or better yet, go on Ebay and buy some vintage shows. The next Kiss Tribute band will feature Anton Fig and Bob (or Bruce) Kulick. Eric is a great drummer, but he doesn't belong in Peter's makeup. Be original dude. Tommy Ace wanna be, go back to booking hotels and ordering food. Or better yet, go back to Black N Blue. The bottom line: There is only one Kiss: ACE, PETER, GENE & PAUL."
1,depressing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"as with most of these reviews i agree with the fact that eric and tommy arent peter and ace,they dont play with the same emotion and the energy level of a kiss show has went way down from when i first saw them on animalize. gene is just out to make another dollar and it sickens me as a guy who has supported this band since i was about 7 years old,im just glad that the great bruce kullick didnt end up a part of this scam! sadly kiss has died,at least i have the old memories,if youre a true kiss fan avoid this lame show!"
1,Real KISS fans please read......,"This is not kiss. I have been a fan since 1976, and I must say I have no intrest in buying this dvd. I am so sick of another ""Greatest Hits"" type cds they have been putting out....they are doing nothing but living off of their past. If this is the ""new"" kiss, as quoted from Paul Stanley, how about getting new costumes/outfits for Tommy and Eric. Leave Peter's and Ace's original make up alone as for when Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent did.....Gene has done nothing but embarressed himself with his solo album and I'm pretty sure Paul will too. Please KISS, give us, the fans, what we really want...THE REAL KISS!! A new studio album.....Kiss is two members away from being another tribute band.....I'm sorry."
5,Great little commentary,"I have been very pleased with Motyer's commentary on James. Best-known for his Isaiah commentary, the thread of his insights into imago dei and how that plays out in the two tables of the Decalogue are very useful in considering James.If preaching or teaching in James, a great resource."
2,"Poor flash, useless indoor","Compact camera with tiny flash. Pretty much useless in the evening, or indoor. Can't focus most of the time (indoor/evening). No capability for external flash. Pictures taken during the day is good, especially using ""spot"" metering.I bought this for my wife. She has indoor/evening meetings all the time, and this camera is just useless for her. *sigh*Maybe I am asking too much for little price."
2,"Compact, but not good pictures","I received this camera free from a Christmas party drawing (Grand Prize.) I have to say that my Kodak DX3500 has better picture quality than this one. It's cute and compact, but the picture quality is not good."
4,Very good but...,"Love the small size and fast startup time, as well as the ability to manipulate manual controls if you want. A couple of things that I miss from my previous Canon Digital Elph: 1- there is no TV (RCA connector) hookup. This is a really nice feature so you can come home and quickly do a slide show on the TV. 2- the charger cable is almost as big as the charger. Again, Canon did it right; the slightly larger charger has prongs built right in, no cord to tie up or tangle.Otherwise, nice small, feature-packed package with 3mp capability."
1,BEWARE of 6 MONTH Warranty,"I liked this camera alot, but it broke after 8 months. Konica Minolta only has a 6 month warranty. I expected at least a one year warranty. Now i am out 280 dollars. I probably won't get another Konica Minolta product EVER!"
4,"Nice, but expensive","I'd been looking for a pocketable digital camera for quite some time and finally settled on the Dimage Xg (after trying and returning several others). For what you get it's a bit on the pricey side, but it can take great-looking images. It is a nice size with easy-to-use menus and controls. The zoom is much quieter than my Nikon Coolpix 995 and image quality is about the same, maybe even slightly better. However, the Xg does have serious issues with focus, esp. in dimly-lit areas or where the contrast difference is very high (for example, at first I could not get an accurate focus on my blank and white dog). This can be rectified with careful composing and locking the focus. Also I found switching to SPOT FOCUS works much, much better. All in all, it's a nice camera I can easily drop into a pocket and have when I need it."
4,Excellent Product,"All:I have had this camera for a week and really like it.PROS: Everything the ads say are true. Great pics.Fast startup and snap. Great for people who dont wantto mess with lot of manual settings, although you can dothat too.CONS: Have to think hard for these, but the lens is in a spot that you have to be careful not to cover with your finger when snapping a pic. Also, dont buy the Minolta camera case that you can get to fit the camera. It is a poorly designed case."
1,DO NOT BUY - PRODUCT HAS BEEN RECALLED,"I bought this charger, and to be honest been quite happy with it thus far (had it about a month). However I just received a letter saying under certain conditions, the charger will overheat the batteries and could damage the batteries and the charger, though there is no chance the batteries will burn or explode.Costco and a few other websites have put up statements and how to return yours if you need to."
1,This book is useless,I bought this book because I'm new to Oracle and the book title has the words 'starter kit'. This is a farce because it already assumes you have a little knowledge of Oracle. So I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone starting out. What makes this book completely useless is the fact that it goes through a tutorial example that doesn't even exist on the CD. There is no possible way to follow through the chapters because it keeps referring to this example that doesn't exist. This was the worst computer book I've ever bought.
3,Not for the beginner,"I know PL/SQL, but have never used Developer. This book explained Developer concepts well enough to get me started, but it's usefulness ended there . Reading about the sample project was somewhat helpful, but it did not include information about where to put code. In fact, the author claims that knowing PL/SQL is relatively unimportant to using Developer. This is not a reference book, but neither does it provide a simple, to-the-point example of how to use Developer. The example was too complicated for someone who just wants to get the idea and experiment on her own.On the plus side, though it is not the focus of the book, the sample database was very helpful in demonstrating the details of implementing an object-relational database."
2,Don't buy this book for the CD!!!,"I've been very angry this past week since I had this book.I purchased the book pretty much for the CD. I've got a slow modem so I can't afford to download the software from the internet site.Basically the CD requires you get a trial authorization key (by registering at .... This is to be able to install the software. However, the page leads to a 404 error message. I've spoken to Oracle and the publishers and they have been VERY unhelpful.So all I can say is, if you are buying the book for the CD, then DON'T buy the book.How good is the book? Well, I havn't read it yet! No point in using the book without the software installed."
1,Example libraries used in book not included,"It could be a good book. But, from chapter 4 on the reader has to struggle to find ways around the missing library (TalbotStandard) which was not included on the CD. And nowhere does the author mention how to obtain the library or the example database. You can type in 30+ pages of data given in an appendix but you still can't work the examples given in the book. A really really bad job of QA here. The author and/or the publisher blew it big time. If I could return it and get my money back, I would."
1,Review of ORACLE DEVELOPER Starter Kit by Robert Muller,"The reader can not go very far without the trial software which is NOT on the CD as stated in the book cover and on YOUR web site. I have sent a note to the author and the publisher seeking their assistance, but they have not even bother to respond. I would advise other readers not to buy this book unless you already have the software. It is not for the starter.I know one can down load the software from ORACLE but how long it will take to down load over 200Mb on an average speed of less than 10 Kb/s, assuming the connection holds. It is not practical."
1,Starter Kit??? This kit doesn't work!,"I just wanted to learn more about Oracle Developer... I know MS Visual Studio 6.0 and .NET featuring SQL, but I wanted to start learning Oracle in order to use the development capabilities its tools... This book is really disorganized! I really wonder if it is a starter kit... This kit doesn't work. I have tried to get the TALBOTSTANDARD LIBRARY used since chapter 3 but no way... it's not included any where... I tried installing the Oracle 6.0 Demo Forms but only the tables mentioned in Appendix A are created... I think I will have to buy another book.----------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: You can download the mentioned TALBOTSTANDARD LIBRARY at http://www.osborne.com/products/0072120479/0072120479_code.zip or http://shop.osborne.com/cgi-bin/oraclepress/downloads.html. However, the book is unfortunately a lost of money. It's not updated and very rought."
2,Close but no cigar,This DVD was disappointing. The subtitles talk about the pictures but nothing is really explained (ie previous knowledge is needed to understand what they are talking about). Saving it for a day I am sick/absent. Hopefully that will be after we have covered most of the material that has to do with stars
5,very good!!,"I'm very happy with my purchase, and for sure would continue to shop here thanks amazon."
1,Not safe.,Terrible quality. Rope was frayed along it's length and the hoist does not lift evenly due to the weight never being exactly equal.I threw both in the trash after having to uninstall them and patch holes in my garage ceiling. This is a trip to the body shop waiting to happen.
2,Racor is better,"I ordered thinking the item would be the same as the Racor or another set I had ordered a year ago. Not the case, the problems here:* Rope is a loose weave nylon that slips off the rollers easily (Racor comes with mountain climbing style tight weave rope).* Screws are not very strong and strip easily. I replaced with higher grade wood screws.* Poor grade rollers do not lift the bike evenly.Buy the Racor."
4,"Great product overall, but may need new rope","I researched a number of hoist systems and overall have been very pleased with this one. It is very solid construction and very easy to mount. The only complaint I have is that the rope has started to fray a bit, as suggested in other reviews, but would be easy and cheap to replace at the point that I need to.I have two systems mounted to the ceiling that is about 14' high, and the included ropes are just long enough."
5,Bike Hoist,Compact and fits in just the right space. Quick payment = Quick delivery. Impressed with how easy it was to set up as well.
5,Quick & easy,"Gear was great - went up quick and the bikes haven't fallen down yet, so I'd say we're in business!"
4,As advertized,Hardware is good and solid and looks like it will last. Installation was straight forward and product worked as expected. Rope provided is substandard though and depending upon frequency of use I don't expect it to last.
4,Does the job.,"Like the design, works exactly as advertised. The materials leave something to be desired.Material flaws: Rope quality is mediocre; Clamps that attach to the lower pulleys are soft metal; Rubber material on the clamps slips off easily; Screws to hang this are soft and easily stripped.Design issues: Easy for rope to slip off from upper pulley wheels; no dedicated attachment point for the front end of the rope; Clamps can slip off of seat or handlebars; no safety catch mechanism if they do; sometimes (often) the bick will lower unevenly.All this being said, it still gets 4 stars because it's a good value for the money and easy to rig around the issues. If I was using this item daily to raise and lower the bike, rather than seasonally, I'd find another solution."
5,Space Saver,Item is sturdy and was quite simple to install once I located my ceiling joists (I opted for longer screws and washers just for my peace of mind). Bikes are now stored up and out of the way. Very pleased with this purchase.
5,Reclaim your unused space,"The installation time wasn't too bad, the instructions were clear, and the product works just like it says. Now our bicycles hover over the hood of our car in what would normally be dead space."
3,bike hoist,You get what you pay for on this item. As described on other reviews the robe is very poorly made. Everything else is as expected. Very easy to change rope.
5,Great Tool !!!,My husband loves it. It was easy to install and finally the bikes found the right place in the garage. Very neat!!
1,Poor Execution,"Beware, the RAD and Racor bike ceiling mounts have minor important differences. Previously I had purchased a Racor, and I thought I was buying the same bike mount when I bought the RAD. The main important difference is the hooks. The RAD's hooks are ""L"" shaped; they're not ""J"" shaped like those in the illustration advertising the product. The RAD's hooks are also rivited onto the pully assemble and the tension cannot be adjusted. The rubber coating on the RAD's hooks is also short; it only comes up about 1/2"" after the turn.If you're looking for a bike mount, the Racor is also cheaply made, but it's certainly better than the RAD for only a couple of dollars more."
4,Nice product - one hint,We bought two sets of pulleys. They were easy to install and easy to use. My 8 and 6 year old daughters use them for their bikes.One hint: Lower the pulleys to ground level where it is easy to unhook the bike. Tie a knot in the rope at the brake. Doing so will avoid having to get the ladder because you forgot to lock the rope and the weight of the pulley pulled the rope up into the brake mechanism.
4,"Works great, need tall garage ceiling","Need tall ceilings to hang the bike up high enough. Works great, except I have to duck when I cross my garage. Still I have a lot of extra space now that the bikes are up and out of the way. Just bought a third bike hoist. Now I need to find a spot to install it where I won't hit my head."
3,What Do You Expect for $20?,"Not to impressed with the unit. Does not operate smoothly up and down. Have to pull down on the pulleys to get it to lower, even with the ""brake"" off (rope pulled toward center of the two pulley assemblies). Rope will have to be replaced soon as it is already fraying."
3,Ceiling Mount,Two people should operate the mounting of bikes on this hoist. The reason is for added safety and to insure balance of the bike.
2,Avoid this and spend the extra money on the rail mount version,"I installed it exactly as the directions specified with the exception of using larger lag screws to hold it in. The hooks are the main problem. They don't hold the bike with much stability at all. The handle bar hook wasn't too bad, but it did not inspire confidence. The seat looked the least stable and failed the first time I tested i,t and several times after. I wasn't willing to chance parking my care under this for that reason and returned it. If they made the ""hooks"" hook shaped it would work, but I'm not willing to spend time modifying them or adding bungie straps to make it safe as some buyers have done."
3,Best for infrequent use,"This bike hoist isn't bad for the price, but I only use it to keep a spare bike out of the way. As others have noted, use your own screws and make sure you attach the hoist to joists. Also bend the hooks to give them a better shape. When I get the time and energy, I'll also replace the rope. It is very frayed after just a couple of uses and gets snagged in the mechanism. The bike tends not to lower evenly without a lot of guidance.I would never use this if I had to put my bike up every day. But it's okay if you only take the bike down a couple of times a season."
5,Bike Hanger,I own 4 of these and they all work great. I have had 2 of them for almost 10yrs with no problems. I highly recommend this product.
4,"Great product, however the quality can be improved easily","The RAD Ceiling mount is a great idea and the hardware is somehow well made. It will allow you to store your bikes without losing space on the floor. Moreover, it is much more secure than leaving the bike standing on the floor.Metal parts of the hardware is well made. Good painting and well built. The rope could be better. It doesn't feel good and it looks like it will not last long. Good upgrade is to buy a new rope and change it.Another upgrade are the hooks, the plastic protection doesn't stay on it. Duct tape on it.I think that it also doesn't work with light bikes. I have two of then, the one with the lighter bike needs some help to lower it so it is nice to keep it on a height that you can reach.On the overall it is a good product, good idea. The ""braking system"" works well."
5,Better than expected,"Easy to mount, looks like good quality materials looks like it will hold for a long time. I love it"
4,Big Bag,"The bag is bigger than expected. It is already coming in handy for bike tools storage, etc. the only thing that was unexpected and puzzling is the amount of time it took to receive. Other than that, we'll worth the money and wait."
3,"works ok, inexpensive","decent value for the money. mine wouldn't balance the load very well. It would lift the front very far before balancing the rear. This is probably due to cheap pulleys. I can't dog it too much, it is very inexpensive."
4,Want to gets your bikes off your garage floor.Now there's no excuse!,Easy to install and now's there's no excuse not to unless you don't have a garage! Well worth the money. Now the only thing I am not sure of is getting the bike down but I will deal with this in the spring.
4,5 bikes now ceiling mounted,Pros:- 5 of my families bikes are now out of the way.- Easy to lift. Easy to lower.- I do like the safety latch - it holds very well and operates automatically.Cons:- Rope is easily snagged- Supplied screws are too short to reach rafter when you add up the metal unit + 2 ply wall board.
5,Easy to use,"I love these bike pulleys; easy to use and works well. Was a big deal to install. Just make sure you have a few hours. Good price, too."
5,Works great!,"Just as described, works great and easy to use! Very satisfied with this product and recommend it to otheers, good buy!"
5,Great Bike Storage,The perfect idea to make room in the garage - this bike hoist is very easy to mount and rig. Love the automatic rope stop - and it is so easy to raise and lower the bike. Very good quality and value for the price - very happy with this hoist
5,Worked like a charm!,"Arrived quickly, was easy to install and does a great job keeping our bikes out of the way. The rope is very sturdy as well."
5,great space saver,purchased this for half the price of the exact same hoist I bought at sports chalet! I raised our 2 beach cruiser bikes up to the ceiling and you hardly know they are there.
2,Damaged my bike :(,"My bike fell off when at the top of the ceiling of garage causing $70 in damage. Bent handlebars and broken bar end. The hooks on this product are an L shape and have very cheap rubber like end pieces that do not stay on. If the hooks where more of a ""fishhook"" or U shape this item would work out. I may have to drill a hole on each hook and put a bolt through it to keep bike from slipping off the hooks.Also the pulley system doesn't work that great, theres a bit of binding and the rope slips off the side of the pulleys sometimes. + when hoisting the bike up, the front and rear doesn't go up evenly but at an extreme angle where for example the front of the bike will be pointing down at like a 20 degree angle and sometimes i have to pull on the rope from the rear hooks to even it out - i hope that made sense :>"
5,Rad Bike Hoist,"This product was easy to install. I had it installed in about 15 minutes. Its easy to use. My eight year old raises and lowers his bike with ease. As fas as looks, its great because we don't even hardly notice it up at the ceiling."
4,Does it's job,Works just as advertised. Gets the bikes up out of the way for the most part. If my ceiling in the garage was about a foot taller that would be ideal but still not much ducking is needed to get under the bikes. One thing I foresee changing in the future is the rope. The nylon rope supplied frays and snags on things really easily and I'll probably end up swapping it out for a tougher climbing cord style rope later. Otherwise a good product.
5,Sooo cool,love it! they work like window blinds so it it easy to raise and lower. I even have them overlapping and I can easly pull it over while I drop the bikes down.
5,Bike Hoist,This product works perfectly for our needs and was easy to order and arrived earlier than expected.
2,Decent at best,"This bicycle mount is decent at best. It mounts well into the ceiling, u must attach to a crossbeam though, sheetrock will not hold the weight of a bike.The cord will come of the pulleys pretty easily which means u have to climb up a ladder to put them back on track every time, real beatdown. the hooks that u put under the seat & handlebars are not hooked enough & super hard to bend.Not a great product but works decent at best if you have to get your bike off the ground in the garage."
1,Does not include all proper hardware,"Does not include the proper bolts to hang correctly. Seemed like more of a pain and hassle than it is worth, and of course I am now outside of my return window and am stuck with these things. I wouldn't recommend spending money on these things, but if you are bent on doing so, let me know and I can make you a good deal on the three I bought that I decided weren't worth the effort to hang. (how about that for a sales pitch, eh?). These things are poorly designed and take more effort than it should. My advice is to look elsewhere."
3,Good hoist,The hoist works fine just like advertised. There's not much to really say about something mundane like this other than it works just fine and the price is right too.
1,Beware,"This is absolute garbage. I bought it thinking I was getting a deal, but when I got it put up, the rope wouldn't stay on the pulley, and when it came off, it jammed the whole mechanism. Then one of the ropes stopped moving, the bike fell off the hooks and I was lucky that I wasn't under it. If you choose to buy it, be sure to wear a hard hat and shoulder pads when raising or lowering your bike, and be sure to only use bikes that you don't care about. Good luck."
4,Hanging Bike Rack,Received this item as promised. Have not had a chance to install it yet so can't give a proper review of its usefulness.
1,MADE IN CHINA CRAP,Sub-standard quality product made in china.Poor packaging.Don't make my mistake and buy rubbish from countries who hate us!
2,wasted space,"My husband and I got these thinking that they would open up floor space in our garage. Well, it did open up space, and they are easy to get up and down (we use them for our moutain bikes)...however, the space left under them is wasted. You cannot store under them because 1) you need to be able to lower them to the ground and 2) the bikes still hang pretty low so you cannot walk or store anything of height under them. Personally, I think a verticle double stack wall mechanism would be a better space saver."
1,bike hoist,"If my bike were a a conventional mountain or road bike, this hoist would probably work perfectly, however I have a tandem recumbent that is 10 feet long. When hoisting, the front end rises rapidly and the rear stays put. I must hold down the front for the back to catch up, a real PITA."
5,Great gadget,"This was a bit tricky to install, but once we got started, it was fairly easy. One note: do not try to adjust the bike while it is suspended! My boyfriend did, and it slipped off the holder and he caught it before it landed on us. Other than that, I love the product. Its easy to use, and I like that my bike is out of the way."
2,hanging bike rack,it was easy to put up. put when brought it down it cam loose from the hooks on one end and the rope hart my hand i had to bend the hooks me to hold the bike.
5,works great,Product worked great. Only complaint I have is that the piece they give you to wrap the extra line around is not big enough so I just tacked in two nails so I didn't have to add so many wraps to the rope.
4,"Works good, but could use a little improvement.","I already have 3 of these hoists, and have used them for a couple years. The only challenge I have is with wear and tear on the rope used in the hoist. The rope can fairly easily slip out of the wheels in the hoist and will begin to wear."
4,Does the job Well,"I think the construction on this thing is fine and certainly worth the price compared to others. It operates smoothly if you assemble it properly and use the measurements they provide. I was overly cautious when installing it so I deviated a little from their directions which meant I had to make a trip to the hardware store. Once I had everything though it went together and up pretty easy. I'm getting another one for another bike and will probably end up owning a couple more as my kids get older and their bikes also need to be stored. Can't imagine how you could be disappointed with this thing. If you are thinking about trying it before buying multiples don't bother. I did that so now I'm going to have to get all my stuff out all over again, it would have been easier to mount them at the same time. For best results I suggest mounting to a flat 2x4 first, it might not look as pretty but it's not going anywhere."
3,Some problems,"Maybe two-and-a-half stars? The rope supplied was flimsy, frays easily, and will need to be replaced soon. The two ""hooks"" were actually L-shaped, would not reliably hold my bike seat and handlebars, and had to be reshaped on a vise. Installation was difficult, requiring mounting the unit on a 2x4, climbing a ladder with it, holding the unit in place with one hand, and starting the screws with the other hand. Two persons and two ladders would be really nice (and much safer).But, the price was good. And (if you have a 12-foot ceiling in your garage), it is nice having the bikes completely out of the way, with foot traffic underneath."
2,You get what you pay for,"The bike goes up and down so shaky and uneven that it takes two people to take the bike up or down. When you pull on the cord, one part of the bike goes up first and the hooks are flat - so they can come out of their place if someone doesn't hold them. It is very difficult to get the cleat on the top to allow me to lower the bike as well. I wish I would have spent more and got a better built unit."
5,Great story!,I love all of the Fern Michaels books that I have read. She's awe awesome. I really loved the recipes!
1,Should never have been published: juvenile effort at writing!,"I've enjoyed Fern Michaels's books in the past but this one was pathetic; if she wrote it, it must have been when she was writing short stories in a notebook during high school. The dialogue was too often a long run-on, never-took-a-breath sequence that jumped from one thing to another, one reaction, one thought to another. Extremely unrealistic and simplistic, strange relationship between the sisters, strange dependence on the memory of their mother (though I did like the little touches of ghostly interventions here and there), no development of characters and they didn't even stay true to what little characters they had!, I could go on and on. Do NOT waste your money: even if the price was lowered to $.99; if you value good writing, even free isn't worth it: you'll just get as upset as I was!"
1,deeply annoyed,"I managed to finish the book but it was difficult due to my annoyance that the author obviously had no interest in developing characters with any sense of reality. The hero supposedly dreams of becoming an architect yet can't even create a warm or stylish living space? A house that somehow the heroine livens up with a checkered placemat? Dumb. Even a small amount of research would have informed the author that a great deal of rigorous training and time goes into being an architect and one isn't just handed a partnership and a client (particularly without supervision of an licensed and therefore legal architect) without first several years of actually doing the grunt work. There is no depth to these characters, the plot devices are contrived and the author didn't really know much about the occupations she gave her characters. Lazy writing in my opinion."
1,Please do not spend money on this!!!!!,"Fern Michaels...who did you give ghostwriting abilities to? This was very badly written...no terribly written. I never again will take a Fern Michaels book without...well, nevermind, I won't read the books at all because this was so badly executed."
1,How Old Was Michaels When She Wrote This One?,"I have enjoyed Fern Michaels as an author in the past, however this book reads like a child wrote it. There is no development of character or plot. The sentence structure is that of a child. The way the dialogue rambles you would think the main character is also 5. I wonder if this book was actually written when the author was a child herself."
1,Couldn't Finish It,"This was my first Fern Michaels - and probably my last.This book was on special for only $0.99, and she is an author I have been meaning to try, so . . .I don't think it is really fair to make a decision solely based on an older book off an author's backlist; this was published in the early '90's. But the character portayal was so incoherent and the writing style so disjointed that it couldn't hold my attention. And there was nothing to offset that, nothing to indicate I should try again with a later book from a more experienced author.If you are already a fan, you can pick this up on the cheap. But I cannot recommend to anyone looking for a new author."
3,"Great potential, but no detail","This book has the potential for a wonderful love story, but I felt it was written in a rush. First of all, there were mistakes that weren't even caught, using the wrong names for characters, Paul when it should have been Jack, etc.I really felt I was reading an ""abridged"" version of the book, there was no time to get to know the characters, no development of their relationships, no detail into their past. I felt more like I was watching a movie. My first Fern Michaels novel, and a bit of a disappointment."
3,"A pleasing southern tale, a little bit supernatural","This is my first Fern Michaels book.This was a pleasant story about a ""work alcholic"" twin and the love she finally meets. The story tells a lot of details about life in the ""richer"" part of the south and paints a real good picture in your mind so it is easy to see the setting. The story centers around a maltese and a boxer (dog) and their owners. It is love at first sight for the dogs and this leads to some rather humorous situations.I did think that the book was VERY predictable as to what would happen next which I found to be a bit dissapointing. Which is why I only gave it 3 stars.I did find all of the references to the ""dead mother"" giving signs a bit far fetched and I thought it actually took away from the story.This refers to the unabridged audio version."
1,A waste of good money.,I just can't believe I spent good money on this book. The female was utterly stupid and always ready to jump to conclusions. She was always upset about something and the male was very quick to make a life altering decision in record breaking time. The book is slow and unbelievabe.
3,classic,"Classic Fern Michaels. Light, a quick read. Yes, the plot is predictable and the characters not all that fleshed out, but one doesn't read this author for that. The story is sweet and we can all use a happy end."
1,Listen to Your Heart,"I found this book to be absolutely nauseating. It lacked attention to details and a plot. The characters were absurd. On the bright side, if you are from New Orleans, you will get a couple of good laughs."
3,Sometimes sleepy readings in colourless sound,"My own benchmark for the symphony is Rozhdestvensky's 1960s version, which had drive, colour and a strong idiomatic feel. Compared with that, the Golovschin comes a distinct second best, although it is still a serviceable performance. I'm not so sure about Russia, which almost dies on its feet at one stage. The Mosfilm studio used for this series has, to my ears, a rather unattractive and bloodless acoustic, and this is reproduced quite faithfully on this CD, which at least has sound that is reasonably clear. Overall, I feel that this disc is quite useful for the symphony, despite the reservations mentioned above, but try elsewhere for the tone poem."
5,"Best book on hockey, ever","Those who want to learn about hockey - and not just what Alan Eagleson did to it - should run, not walk, to buy this book.Conway's book is superb, and his work on Eagleson made him a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.It's a must-read for any sports writer, too. It's like having an ""Investigative Journalism 101"" class taught to you, and for a fraction of the money you'd pay at a university."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This book is certainly poor, averaging only 3.00. The Eklund and Benford good work enough to drag it into round to 2.5 territory.Universe 04 : Assault on a City - Jack VanceUniverse 04 : A Sea of Faces - Robert SilverbergUniverse 04 : And Read the Flesh Between the Lines - R.

5,The first bit on golf is an all time favorite of mine.,"Conway is at his best doing the Dorf on Golf segment. Have shown to several golfer friends who really enjoyed. The other segments are not as funny, but they each have their moments."
2,DORF.,"MY WIFE WANTED ME TO BUY THIS DVD. AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, SHE TURNED IT OFF. I ASKED HER WHY SHE TURNED IT OFF, SHE SAID IT WAS BORING BORING BORING!"
1,Save Your MONEY!,"First watched Dorf on Golf and the Dorf Olympics over 20 years ago and thought they were hillarious way back then. Do not know how I have changed in 20 years but did not even find the ones I loved way back then the least bit funny this time around. The ones I have never seen like the Nascar, Fishing, Bingo, etc. all were a complete bore, bore, bore. All I kept thinking was what a waste of my money. They were not in the least bit funny. So bad I could not even finish watching the DVD. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
1,dorf ain't funny,"granted that Tim Conway has always used a more simple minded kind of humor, dorf is nothing more than stupidity exaggerated and after the same jokles are repeated for the 5th time no longer funnyu but tedious"
2,Not All Boring,"Dorf on golf is really cute, but the subsequent themes were extremely boring. We kept waiting for the ""funny parts"", then (finally) ejected the disc to end our brain drain.If you're buying this for the golf video, it may be fine, but don't expect much beyond that."
3,"nice, but...","This is hardly a floor lamp as the illumination is just about sufficient for a desk. It is really a desk lamp on a pedestal, and has one fluorescent bulb.The lighting itself is fine. It takes three or four ""blinks"" before the light flashes on fully. Guess that might be expected of fluorescent lamps. On one of the lamps I bought, the starter did not fit in properly (loose fit) and needed manual handling before the light would come on.An expensive affair. Wish they had at least two bulb/tubes in there.The lighting does look natural."
3,good lamp but post tends to lean and lamp hums,I originally bought this lamp for my office. It fit nicely over my computer and covered most of my desk. Good natural light really eases eye strain. Assembly was not difficult but the lamp leans to one side. I positioned it so it was not as obvious. The leaning is weird but I liked the lamp enough to keep it. (I was too lazy to deal with returning and getting a new one.)I now use it as a reading lamp. It fits nicely in a corner behind my chair. It does make a quiet humming sound--common in fluorescent lights. It may be an issue with the starter. I need to look into fixing that.
1,The switch dose not work well,"I have to step the switch over 10 times to turn on the light, it is crazy!Do NOT buy it!"
4,A solid album from Johnny Farnham,"This CD has been in my CD collection for quiet awhile and is filled by a number of good songs. 'Romeo's Heart' has a more of a romantic tilt to it and is aimed and would be great for couples on Valentine's Day. Although single folks like myself will still love the CD. The first track, 'Have A Little Faith in Us' is one heck of a good song and you can tell John has worded the lyrics to mean someone very close in his life. Pretty much we can all relate to his songs on some deep level - Farnham's songs touch many to the core for he sings about things that matter such as Love, Destiny, Desire and Friendship.The track 'Heart's On Fire' is my favourite from this album and is closely followed by 'Second Skin'. A must for any true blue fan of this immensely talented artist"
3,Do I have to?,"I would much rather have someone else give the presentation, to be quite honest. So, I am giving this book to my husband. I thought the information in the book was practical and it enourages preparation. There is a section on how to reduce your fears of speaking in public.Knowing your audience, dealing with logistics, knowing your location, clarifying objectives, finding material, structuring material, writing a presentation, using audio-visual aids, rehearsing, preparing yourself and enhancing your body image are all good points. The avoiding bad habits section was especially good. I mean, if you stand in front of the baord, who can see it? If you slouch, it looks unprofessional.It all sounds so complicated...can't we just all head for the beach. ;> But seriously, this is a fun book filled with basic information for those who have to make presentations to keep others informed about business decisions."
3,Lacking,"This was the first recording I heard when I first came to know the piece. Now, I'm a cellist and subject to my own opinions on how to play this piece...be that as it may, there are still recordings I prefer of this piece. The first would be the historic Rostropovich recording with Ormandy, an any subsequent ones he made--the other would be a new one by Korean cellist Ha Na Chang with Pappano and the LSO. Chang's recording in particular offers a chilling sound in the horn and timpani that Naxos fails to deliver on this recording, as well as superior organization, energy, and technique with the soloist.Maria Kliegel has made better recordings with Naxos, and I encourage listeners to check them out--her Lalo concerto, while not exactly historical or big-name, is pretty good."
2,Mushuggah are better than this,"All I'd heard was Rational Gaze by this band. Now there's a track, awesome. So I checked out the only release I could find, big let down. It just doesn't have the same impact. The vocals are awful. While Rational Gaze had an agression and crunch to the vocals Contradictions never reached the same mix of agression without it just being screaming. I'm sure Meshuggah are better than this album, but this album is not worth buying."
2,"Some interesting moments, but not great.","This album has some great introductory riffs and rhythminterplays (several sounding alot like Metallica) but thevocals (shouting really) ruin it. They also need to develop a sense of music composition that includes melody.There's very little melodic composition here, mainly justcool sounding riffs they probably came up with while jamming.But as I said, this album would be pretty good if thevocalization was improved."
4,Just a little angry...,"For a rhythm you can bludgeon someone to death to, no one does it quite like Meshuggah. It isn't their heaviest album, but still the best thing I've heard lately in that choppy style. It's better than Emmure's new album, which lacks heart; but less harmonious than the new Suicide Silence album. If you don't know those two bands, I recommend them."
5,Contradictions Collapse!,"The beginning of an enigmatic career for Meshuggah. This album isn't really that great compared to Meshuggah releases after this album, but still better than any other thrash album. The standout track is definitely Choirs Of Devastation. This is pretty much a thrash album and no where near as brutal as Meshuggah today. Still worthy enough to own."
5,loved it,Love the sound they create so raw and driving. Meshuggah is definitely one of my favorite bands. Can't want for their next new album
3,Wrong Book for Me,I ordered this book but it wasn't what I needed. I don't feel like the title gave enough info. I have a 1973 280C with a 2.8 DOHC engine. This paticular book covers the 280SL series. Ooops. I'm new to Mercedes - always been a Triumph man - an honest mistake. Amazon was great about taking it back so no complaints.I just thought I'd include the info that I was missing upon purchase. Haynes manuals are the best though...thanks!
5,great resource!,helped me type up a paper for school so great resource! collection of 4 spanish writtings at the time of the discovery of peru! great!
4,"It's not Merchant-Ivory, really !","It just seems that way and not bad Merchant-Ivory at that. I often have some problem understanding certain things about E.M. Forster and this story is no exception, but the movie is very rich and showed that Helena can act (I wasn't so sure after Room with a View). While very funny in parts, it becomes increasingly tragic, presumably to illustrate the dangers of The English abroad. The usual wonderful English cast (okay, Judy Davis is Australian), the period details, and a nice score make a wonderful Zuppa Inglese."
4,Odd story,"This film is a bit odd. I enjoyed it because of the cast, but the story is disappointing and doesn't flow well. The cast consisting of Helen Mirren, Rupert Graves, Helena Bonham Carter and Judy Davis are wonderful, though."
1,"beautiful scenery, terrible story","Some stories don't transcend time, and this is one of them. It's like a bad soap opera. The only redeeming moments, were the opera and beautiful Italy in general... The actors are all first rate, but the storyline is unbelievably bad. Self-righteous, selfish people doing stupid things. Not worth the time."
2,Disappointed!,"I was disappointed in this movie. I was hoping for something better with this cast, but the story line did not do the actors justice. I do not recommend it."
2,"Boring, Depressing...","cant believe i actually paid for this. and i kept checking the clock counter to see if it was almost over and couldnt believe how far behind i still was. I love period pieces but this was just boring, boring, boring. waste of good actors. and NOT funny at all. more depressing than anything. video quality is horrible."
4,Have No Fear,"Fans of the better known ""Forsters"" such as Maurice, A Room with a View, the works of Merchant and Ivory, and fairly similar A Passage to India, may be quite disappointed with this much more quiet and less colourful production. The story-line also offers less of a twist - this is EM Forster's first novel and he was still learning his trade. Still the movie is well worth seeing - the story and the beautiful images in dusky sepias as if taken from old photographs will keep enthralled you in front of the telly if only you can accept that the world changed immensely within the last century. A big bonus is a chance to see world-famous actors in roles not exactly identical with their current careers."
5,A great book,"I loved the book. It's a great mystery, with colorful characters. I love the whole series. It's also a fun book, and it's not full of dark or gruesome scenes like some murder mysteries. I would recommend to anybody who likes mysteries."
5,Laurien keeps getting better and better,"What more can I say? If you are a fan of the series...this one keeps you guessing to the end. The new job...the relationship problems...the brother possibly going to jail...the scandals of the show dog world....Heck! It all takes place in my life! <VBG> Alas, a page turner indeed...the only problem...waiting for the next instalment! Kudos abound for this book!"
4,Great collection,"All Lord of the Rings sets should contain more than one exclusive character. This set is the first to deliver. Three exclusive, detailed figures are included. Most sets feature four repeat figures that no one wants and just one exclusive figure for a high price. This set at least is worth the price. Keep them coming like this one."
5,3amigos from zuland,"These figures are sweet.Accurate depictions of the movie figures, high quality too."
4,Interesting,"I was wondering why a used copy of this classic was so expensive... the product is indeed an orginal, probably from the first soft cover printing in the 1970s, and has no marks on it (even has the original price sticker of $1.50!), but is yellowing a bit and musty, which is nice for old books.So, here is the point, I was hoping to get this a gift for a new mom and daughter, but it really is a collector's item, which is not really appropriate, either for the family or for the book.Maybe there should be a separate category in Amazon: new, used, and vintage/collectors. Maybe I am just naive and should have guessed from the price ($87). So now I have a lovely artifact to re-sell someday, but probably not the gift I was looking for.....No idea why this is not just still in print."
5,A Magical Journey,"This book is magical. The rhymes are irresistible. Our family of seven grown children still quote the rhymes and tell them to their own children. Wendy Watson's drawings are charming. We made up our own songs to the rhymes and later discovered Clyde Watson had put several of them to melodies in Father Fox's Feast of Songs. My kids still sing the ones I made up and Clyde's. ""Belly and Tubs"" became a rocking floor game for two feet to partner's feet and hands held until ""the boat tipped over and they tumbled out""."
5,This was my favorite book as a child.,"It amazes me that this is not one of the classic children's books. It is fun and whimsical, but also includes serious comment about lifes hardships. Among other things, it taught my little sister and I compassion and the importance of sharing. The story managed these feats by portraying truly loveable charcacters, the extensive fox family who live in poverty but still enjoy the little pleasures life has to offer. The book is illustrated so well that the emotion and spirit of each scene really come through. In a very real way this book helped shape my positive outlook on life while keeping me aware of the realities of it. I still keep a copy of it out to remind me of that fox family I grew up with."
3,A pretty good collection of MITB stuff.,"Although many of the songs are too short and there are many Bastard Noise tracks, the rest of the stuff they do is excellent. Their dual bass noisecore songs like Tumult Being and Strifetime rule. The twenty great songs are worth the buy."
2,good but not that good!,These little things are great for the peanut butter/ Hershey's kiss cookies. But there is no way im gonna pay $41 for a bag. No thanks ill use the big ones.
3,Melissa's Fresh Persimmons,I ordered twice from Melissa's- the first was perfect the second was in poor quality. Half the fruit was smashed.
2,batik art,"I am a sewer and love all the batik fabrics in the quilting shops. I usually pick up 1 or 2 fatquarter of batik from any new store I go to. I wanted to learn some of the techniques for use in quilting. Although this book does have some basic techniques I thought the book was adapted to making art. The stamping section left a lot to be desired. uses everyday objects to make dots. In the stamping section which how large yardage is usually made she drew a farm scene. I would of like to known how to use blocks to repeat a pattern not just a single dot. Keep looking if you can only draw stick figures, but if you are already a painter or good at drawing and are looking for a new medium then this book is for you."
1,Disappointing introduction to technique of Batik,Rosi is an extremely talented artist but her book is not a good introduction to the techniques of Batik. Her book is focused on producing a series of projects and the explication of the techniques involved is decidedly secondary to the purpose of the book.
5,Og Mandino Lives!!!,"I was given a hand-me-down copy of the InnKeeper for a Christmas present. After the 5th page I was hooked. After the 50th, the epiphany that Og Mandino still lives came to mine. I was warmed and magnetized. So good was the story that I read it all in one setting. A small book. A big story. A great Christmas present."
5,Leo Ferre sings the words of two poets from the nineteen century and brings them int our day and time,"When I was studying arts and literature, I read the poems of both these poets from the nineteen century. I loved the words.And nobody except Leo Ferre could have imagined the songs to bring these poets into the 21st century.Through Ferre, I feel that these poets are among us, now. Their poems are contemporary because their words reflect human nature.A beautiful interpretation! A great sense of what humanity is.I recommend this CD, not only to those who have read poetry, but to anyone who has wondered what humanity means."
5,The BEST Faure Requiem you will EVER find on this planet.,"If angels didn't descend from above into the instruments and voice boxes of the performers on this recording, I don't know HOW ON EARTH they could be this perfect. I bought this recording in 1994, and have sampled a number of recordings by various and sundry, only to find my memory comparing the notes and tonation to this particular recording. It's very disinct -- particularly Pie Jesu, in the smoothness with each transition between octaves, perennially soothing. You will love it."
4,Questions Galore,"This is the band Blackbird, made up of the brothers, Tony and Chip Kinman (the Dils, Rank and File) with a drum machine. They released three albums, two of them import only on Iloki Records and one on Scotty Brothers...But there's one problem in searching for their CDs. All three albums are self titled. I have the last two, the black covered import and the Scotti Brothers release, but have been looking for the first forever. In this page, the album shown and the track listing is for the first import, but the CD info is for the third album.As for the music, it's mostly Jesus and Mary Chainesque pop with a dancier kick to it, given that they are using a drum machine. The vocals are definitely the Kinman's and the songwriting is very strong. After this incarnation, they went alt-country as the Kinman Brothers."
2,Ai'nt what I thought it was,"In doing research on this album I checked every available web-site for informative descriptions of the content. Most sites that mention this album describe it as an ""industrial/experimental noise"" type of venture. On first listen I found that Blackbird is nothing short of a true pop band in every sense of the word. They remind me of the Church circa late 80's. Not at all what I was expecting. This is not to say that the songs are bad, taken for what they are, However, this does not save this album form suffering from a very dated late 80's new ""alternative"" sound. Definetly nothing special. Definetly monotonous. Thankfully, I am only out three bucks for this one."
2,There's a reason all of this is so cheap,"The lenses suck. They make my photos blurry. You can't use the flash because the lenses get in the way and even if you don't use the flash the pictures are all weird. I'm no novice when it comes to this stuff. The tripods and cleaners and bag...fine. I asked for this for Christmas, thinking that I was really going to be able to improve my photography, but I was very, very disappointed. I keep trying and cleaning the lenses, hoping for something different, but they just suck. Eventually I'll buy another camera...there's only so much I can do with this. :("
4,Delightful!,"While Mozart's early symphonies do not have the breadth and sheer power of his later works, they still offer a wonderful listening experience. These light and airy pieces overflow with the charming melodies and harmonies that became Mozart's calling card. If you like Mozart, then you will love this excellent disc!"
3,SOUNDS FINE TO ME.,3 STARS because these are his early music.To me his early music did not sound that good .But it is a bargain of course.These are rarely heard now
1,This Game Has Soft Ware Trouble,Need The 64-Bit Soft Ware Please See Information From The Vender To Down Load This Soft WareIt Free Of Charge But Make Sure Your Computer Is able To Read It Or You be Out Of Luck.
4,this is a good western,"A good account of the James gang. I feel it was well researched, a well written script, and good acting."
4,Jesse who?,"In this delightful film, Jesse James takes a back seat in the buckboard to Cole Younger who shows a real talent for fixing calliopes and robbing banks, though this one didn't turn out too well. Better let Jesse plan the next one."
2,Not a very good movie.,"They spent some money on costumes, but they look like costumes. They spent some money on actors, but they needed to spend more on a screen play that did not alter actual events in a misguided effort to seem relevant to the 1970's. Quick delivery as always, but I wish I had skipped this one."
2,A whizzer speaker,These speakers have a very small magnet and not much weight to them. They remind me a lot of the old whizzer cone speakers you would get factory in cars. They are tinny and do not play into lower octaves very well. They are very reasonably priced and do make noise but there are a lot better speakers out there.
5,no regrets,Polypropylene Cone-Cloth Surround.100 watt rated PEEK POWER.Easy wiring.Low pro cover. Flush mount.SOUND: GOODPrice: fair per setWorking well with low output radio.
1,Great Filters,"Coffee is Sooo good with my Chemex coffee maker however, I am not giving the filters high marks: I think you should know that the coffee filters are not sealed. They come inside the box 'plain' with no wrapper and the box is not sealed to the air.... Come on Chemex... Wrap it up!"
1,The Missing Hat,"A hat was missing from a costume page. I had a new book sent, but the hat was still missing. Apparently, the entire book printing had left the hat out. It appears to be the hat that the adult woman is wearing on the front cover."
4,A useful guide for parents and professionals,"This illustrated manual was created to help parents and educators teach students with developmental disabilities about puberty, appropriate social and sexual behaviors, and personal safety. The guide was designed to be read to young persons age 12 and older, and it contains information on the following topics: social behavior; personal safety; sexual anatomy; puberty and hygiene; sexual behavior; and pregnancy and birth control. The book contains explicit descriptions and illustrations, and is presented in a loose-leaf format so parents and teachers can remove those pages they do not wish to use. Please visit our website to obtain a copy of this hard-to-find resource."
3,Really intriguing but difficult to follow-up upon,"I read the book in one weekend and just couldn't put it down when I finally got into it. While a lot is referred to, ""The I AM "" series for instance there was no further reading or reference section. I had a problem with the ET section and references, but as I live in Glastonbury a lot of other strange things happen so I keep an open mind. I think there is a lot of thought provoking stuff and reading it was worth the effort. I just wish there was something to follow it up with."
1,Not happy with my purchase,"I purchased this product in August 2007. Today I am mailing it back to the manufacturer (with their authorization). I have tried many times since the purchase to get this drive to work, to no avail. I even purchased EMC Retrospect thinking that I needed this software to back up my internal hard drive. WRONG! I finally sent it in to my computer guru for help along with my CPU. I should have known something was wrong when I registered the hard drive and Iomega had a problem with the serial number. According to Iomega, there was a batch of hard drives that had a missing number in the serial number. I think my hard drive was missing something more than a serial number. I am looking forward to receiving a replacement hard drive that actually works. Hopefully I will return with a more positive review, but for now, I am spending more money than I planned on spending on this external hard drive (EMC purchase, postage to mail back, computer guru)."
4,"Only 465GB, but otherwise excellent.","Only 465GB instead of the advertised 500GB (that's why I'm not giving the full 5 stars - I dislike misleading publicity), but otherwise I am very satisfied.I have Windows XP and using this external HD was really a plug-n-play straightforward procedure."
1,Not good for a bootable OS X backup,"I bought this for use as a bootable backup for OS X via Super Duper. After formatting in HFS, I can make a backup but getting the drive to stay on during boot is difficult, it shuts itself off during the Mac restart. Only by turning on the power at just the right time during boot does it work.It might be something that I'm doing wrong but I can't get any help from the Iomega support site to figure it out. The discussion pages are unavailable. Their Google cache shows another customer having the exact same problem I've encountered without an answered posted."
5,Solid Piece of Equipment,The Iomega drive is a vast improvement over the cheaper plastic drive I had previously -- both in quality and performance. The on/off switch and holding stand are nice touches. Very happy with my purchase (so far).
5,An easy to use plug and go external drive,"I bought this item about two weeks ago and it serves its purpose very well. it is very quiet, does not take up much space, and is very easy to use. all you have to do is plug it in and start transferring data either automatically or manually. i am glad i bought this item but i strictly use it for back up and my media files like games and movies."
4,decent external HD,"I'm happy so far with my Iomega external HD compared to the ""simpleTech"" I had which is not reliable. it's still very recent for me to tell if the iomega will go bad as the simpleTech did....will know better in time.it has power button, connects easily via USB, cool blue light when it's on. it has a little noise when it's on but nothing compared to my laptop's fan but that's not a show stopper. I usually turn it off when I'm not using it but I've forgotten it on for few days and it didn't get terribly hot as I read on some other review about it, it was slightly warmer than usual but not even in the ""hot"" category.overall it's good, I have nothing to complain about (yet) and I would buy the same brand if I need more space especially that it has a very good price."
4,Great destop hard drive at a Great price,"For the price, this was a great buy for a desktop hard drive. The packaging and mailing was very good, plus arrived quick. Thanks!"
4,Iomega hard drive,"Very happy with this product. It's easy to set up, easy to use and the price was right."
4,If only I had 500 GB,"You get almost 500 GB of good storage on this baby, plus a bright blue light that will remind you of some alien critter. I taped over the light, and the disk worked perfectly. A bit on the slow side, but then I am just using it to back up lots of data. It worked perfectly, and sits there all day looking cool, but actually runs a bit too warm. Give it plenty of ventilation and you will probably have no problems."
1,Too Hot To Handle,"I purchased three of these drives, and several of the LaCie 500gb drives. Although none of these drives have burned up yet, the Iomega drives are too hot to put your hand on and keep it there. I mean HOT as in I am concerned about a fire hazard. The LaCie drives are warm, but not severely hot like these. I would not recommend buying these drives for that reason alone."
1,Piece of junk,Unfortunately amazon.com wouldn't let me give it zero stars. Nothing worked. Starting with the AC adapter. Returned product and re-ordered the LaCie 500GB which works BEAUTIFULLY! (And looks so much better.) How Apple could have actually endorsed this product in tandem with Leopard is beyond me.
1,Where's the CD for the Hard drive,"When I received the Hard drive, I ASSUMED it came with a CD, it did not, and therefore I had to go to the Iomega website to download for this hard drive, and there were 100's of options, of which I had no clue which one to select.I attempted to download one of the options, but it never completely would download my data, only partially, so I gave up after 3 seperate attemps and returned it."
3,Compatibility with Widows Vista 64,"I bought this item beeing sure that was compatible with Window Vista 64.But my expectations weren't fulfilled. I am not saying that it is a badprodutct, but for its capacity it should be compatible. Neverthless, thesmall Iomega notebook drive of 160 and 250GB is compatible. I really don't understand."
3,Buyer Beware,It was a 5 star... but now I don't know...We bought this in Sept 07 and it was working fine until recently my son moved it when it was plugged in or something...we weren't looking and now the thing won't work. BE VERY CAREFUL AROUND CHILDREN!! Look for extended warranty or something.
1,2nd unit just crapped out for no reason,"My first one worked for a week or so, left it on for a day, turned it off. Turned it on to move my desktop data to my laptop and it worked for about 5 min, then the light goes off, motor runs, and it doesn't work.Returned it, got another. Copied stuff over seemed fine.Left it alone for a few months (its my back for goodness sake) so now its out of warranty, and now I plug it into one laptop, it isn't recognized. Plug it into my second laptop, it recognizes it. Back to the first, copy data over, and my laptop got unplugged (battery is dead, hence backing it up), and now nothing can read the drive at all. Out of warranty, big old paper weight. buy anything but this."
1,No instruction come with how to use this Ext HD 500 GB,very disappointed No instruction come with how to use this Ext HD 500 GB.No CD disc came with the product.Tiny little brochure in many languages little english section instruct how to plug in ONLY.I pluged it in & icon come on desktop. I click on the icon but could not get it to work(I am using win XP). For 5 days already I have try to find info in iomega web to try to get it to work but no luck. Could not even get to download the driver. Will NEVER buy Iomega products again.
1,Will Not Transfer Files Greater Than 4Gb,"The drive works fine, unless you wish to transfer/store any file bigger than 4Gb because it's FAT32 formatted. Go with the Iomega 500Gb Ultramax instead. The Ultramax is formatted differently and does not have the 4Gb limitation."
2,Iomega hard drive didn't work with my computer,"I have a 4 year old Dell Computer and I couldn't get this drive to work with it. First it didn't seem to recognize it was there. Then it gave me a message to ""Format drive"". I didn't format it. I wanted it to just work as plugged in. I returned it and got a Seagate 250 GB drive locally and it works fine. The salesman told me some drives don't work with old USB connections (like mine) and this was more likely to be a problem with larger drives. I am very happy with my Seagate drive."
1,unhappy,"I was very happy at first, in fact happy enough to by another one. Then the first hard drive went out in less than 2 months."
1,Humnm,"THe hard drive worked great when i got it first, but after only a few short weeks, the power is fter going, and it wont stitch on, so i've lost a bunch of photos. I bought the hard drive when i waas in the US and now I'm home in Ireland, it worked grand here until yesterday. Does anyone know what Amozons return policy is on such items?, i cant find anything about it"
2,Misleading capacity,Iomega 33455 Home Network 500 GB NAS Hard DriveThe capacity of this Hard Drive is NOT 500GB. It is 465GB. This is called a fraudulent advertisement. This product is heavy and sometimes noisy too. Please check twice before you buy.
1,Don't count on it!,"Had this for 2 1/2 years. Was backing up my old computer to transfer to my new computer and all of a sudden neither computer sees it. If not under warranty, you're out of luck. Will have to buy a new one which will NOT be an Iomega. Bad product. Bad service."
1,if you wanna trash you data...go for it!,"used this external hard drive for 1 1/2 yrs now, always pleased with the performance except that its noisy n the blue light keeps flashing while processing which is quite annoying to me.One day it stopped working. Without warning. Coudn't turn it on.Did some research on the web n found out that this is quite common with this product! How can iomega put a product that is not working on the market that is supposed to keep your data save?!Although there surly are ways to restore your data I tried to contact iomega on their support site and every single contact link is a dead end! even the listed email address is bouncing back!Keep of that product!"
1,Quit working just after warranty,"I only used it twice. The third time I tried to back up info on it, it had quit working. This happened after 15 months, conveniently after the 1 year warranty. Not the product if you are backing up material you want to protect. Fortunately, I had not deleted any original files or all would have been lost."
4,external,"this is a great external hard drive. I haven't had any problems and holds SO MUCH information. I have tons of pictures, videos, documents, music, etc. backed up, and it's barely made a dent. The only thing I don't like is that it's bulky. It's somewhat large and has two cables (to the ac adapter and to the USB port). I think there are smaller, sleeker models out there now (I bought this about 1.5 years ago)."
4,Very Good BUT,Iomega Desktop Hard Drive 500 GB Hi-Speed USB 2.0 External Hard DriveThis is a great product for backing up of my computer. I wish I had done a bit more research before I purchased this unit. I had to purchase additional software from another dealer so I could use this hard drive as an automatic back up hard drive. With the software it works great. I can't believe the available space. I lost all of my old data due to my old computer actually burning up. The power supply fried everything in my computer. This will not happen again because of the External Iomega Desktop 500 GB Back up hard drive.Great device but lacks scheduling usability by itself.Dan
4,nice hard drive,"For a 500 G hard drive, the product size and the price were very attractive.It's a little slow in transferring data.It does make strange noise when the data are being transferred.But none of the above bothers me.I knocked out one star because the blue light is annoyingly sharp."
4,good and functional,"I mean, I'm not about to go extolling the incredible, powerful, sentimental value for an external hard drive. It works well, (as long as you put it in a USB 2.0 slot) is cheap, and, so far, very reliable. I'm using it mainly as a backup drive for my media files, though some older, lower-end games and aps can be run off of it...(nothing with DirectX 9.0 or higher) There's no firewire support, which generally restricts it to data backup. It's a little large, but it stays very cool, which helps alot in easing my fears of losing data (my other external drive doesn't have any cooling apparatus, and worries the heck out of me when it heats up).Overall, I think it deserves a ""4"" for it's nice, simple functionality.I mean, come on, a hard drive either works, or doesn't."
4,Iomega HD 500 GB,"Nice drive: fast, quiet, attractive, and affordable. It is easy to format, Windows recognizes immediately, and it doesn't take up too much space. The only drawback is that the USB cord is WAY short. I have plenty of replacements, but other buyers probably want to know this. Other than that, I LOVE having this backup drive for pictures/music."
1,"Problems, Problems","This drive does at great job of keeping you data. It is a hassle and a half getting it to work. Even though it is externally powered it keeps zapping the power fro my computer. After a great deal of manipulating the power plug both at the wall socket and the drive Windows Explorer will finally see it and it works well, for five minutes then it's gone. The on/off indicator lamp is always on when it is pluged in and switched on, but the computer can't see it. I have tried it on two machines with the same result. This is a poor choice for an external drive."
1,Did not last a month,I bought this hard drive specifically to download pictures we had taken in Europe to have a backup and within 3 weeks the hard drive did not recognize any computers. I took it to an expert to see if he could get the pictures off of it and it was completely dead.
4,External hardrive,This product is really easy to set up and holds so much. My lap top started working faster right away.
4,Good purchase,Worked without any problems. Little noisy but otherwise very pleased with purchase. Did not need backup software since purchased for use with time machine that comes with leopard operating system for MacPro Laptop
5,Iomega Desktop Hard Drive,"This Product Works really well! i have friends who selected other external hard drives that hate them and they dont run properly. but with my iomega, everything works perfectly!"
4,"A bit of the good, bad, and ugle","The good: it arrived quickly - even the replacement. It connected in just a few minutes. Transferred 20GB of data quickly and easily. I think it is compact, easy to use, and a good value. So far the replacement is working fine.The bad: Next day, my PC couldn't recognize it. Sent it back for a replacement. As a side irk, the replacement doesn't always allow for a normal USB device disconnect - noting that it is busy even though there isn't any software or device creating a connection at that time.The ugly: when I contacted Iomega, after trying to run multiple fixes with them (over an hour), the person sarcastically said it was a Windows problem and I needed to contact Microsoft. They couldn't do anything and did not know what happened saying - ""it is a plug and play device and if it doesn't work, then its a problem with Windows."" So why even try to run fixes! Microsoft said it was an Iomega issue. So, I sent it back."
3,Drive runs hot!,Drive works ok but I was amazed by how hot the external case felt to the touch. I make sure I do not leave this drive un-supervised for fear of burning up!!
4,Good hard drive,Bought this 500 gb ext hard drive. I read lots of review about it. Came out of the box working well. I leave it on for the surv. video at my business. It hasn't shut down unexpectedly yet. A+
5,Works great!,"I have had no issues with this external hard drive. It works exactly as advertised. Hook up is easy with USB (like others), simple power on/off switch."
5,It works great,"I am using this external hard drive as a backup for three different PCs and it works consistantly with all 3. Just plug it in to a USB port drag and drop the files, then use the disconnect hardware Windows feature to disconnect before turning off the unit."
1,Not recognized by computer,"I had this product for about 6 months when it started making a continuous beep, like a busy signal. The blue power light was on and it sounds like the hard drive is spinning. The computer no longer recognized the hard drive.Under warranty they will replace, but you lose your data and the warranty is just for one year.I found many similar incidents for this Hard Drive on the Iomega User Community forum."
1,Be careful of Iomega,"This drive, as all Iomega drives, deserves zero stars, but that is not an option here. I have 4 Iomega drives and ALL have failed. They are external usb drives and used lightly and carefully. With a failure rate this high, these drives are essentially useless. Actually, worse than useless because they have large amounts of data locked up in them so they are really quite a liablility. What good is taking the time to do backups when the drive being used to hold the backups is unreliable? A 100% failure rate is too high to just be coincidence. Iomega needs to get their act together and stop selling cheap drives and concentrate on making what they sell more reliable."
3,Good enough,"This external hard drive it's good enough: it is easy to use, runs fast, has a lot of space to save data... but it's heavy and if you want to use it as a portable disk, you have to remember to carry on the accesories (USB connection and AC power).If you want to use it as a backup disk, this product is perfect!!!"
4,Works great,"The drive was recognized immediately by all of the computers that I use. The transfer rate is very fast and I have heard nothing from the drive when it is operating. There was an earlier complaint about it being noisy, but my drive is very quite.Features that I wish it had ---1 - It has to be manually shut off when turning off the computer.2 - There is no backup software provided.Outside of these issues, it works perfect."
5,Iomega hard drive,Received the product.Iomega Desktop Hard Drive 500 GB Hi-Speed USB 2.0 External Hard Drive - 33654It is as advertised. It performs as expected and I'm happy with the purchase. Thanks for consistently good service. Sandy Burke
5,Iomega external hard drive,"GREAT value, easy to install and use. I feel I saved $100 on this deal. Thank you Amazon."
2,Steer clear.... Drive crashed less than 24 hours after my first review.,"I purchased this item several months ago. My biggest problem is the short cable it comes with. Other problems which have been previously noted by earlier reviewers -- very loud, it gets extreemly hot, and it is only 465G. If you can live with these short comings it is a great drive for you.Update --- it has been less than 24 hours since I wrote the first part of this review *** The drive has crashed. In the middle of writing to the drive it crashed. Iomega will replace the drive but they will not fix the drive and return to me, and Iomega told me to recover the data on the drive (about 50G) will cost a **very reasonable $1000**"
1,Awful - It worked for 1 day and then stopped working!,"I would not recommend this product. It worked for a day and then stopped working. It began making a loud, high-pitched noise and my computer would not recognize the drive."
1,Failed upon installation - Iomega replaced with a REFURBISHED drive,"I do not recommend this drive, or the Iomega company. I bought it from Amazon and it failed immediately upon installation. Iomega's support states returns can only be made through them, so I returned it to Iomega and a REFURBISHED replacement was sent to me! I did not pay full price for a hard drive that failed for someone else!!!!!! I contacted Iomega again to return it for a refund, and they said I couldn't since I bought it from Amazon.I am not risking my data on a refurbished drive. Now I have to try to make some of my money back by selling it on ebay, or elsewhere. I bought the Maxtor 750 One Touch (firewire) and have been very happy with that."
1,No help from Iomega,"My Iomega hard drive was ok until I damaged the power cord. I called and wrote the company for a replacement. They insisted I buy a new cord+transformer set --$45. I reluctantly paid, and when the item arrived it had the wrong plug-in connection. After several attempts, they said send the power unit back and we will replace it. To make certain, I sent both drive and power unit back. That was five weeks ago. I've telephoned and got verbal assurance but no drive. From beginning to end a bad experience. And still no drive."
5,Good buy for external hard drive,"So far a great product. Good price, received promptly, reformatted to NTFS no problem and it is working without a glitch in the Windows Vista automatic backup mode."
1,review - review - review,"Iomega Desktop Hard Drive 500 GB Hi-Speed USB 2.0 External Hard Drivethis is the 3rd, review, first wasn't published, 2nd deleted in process.Thank you very much, now I know what you won't accept for a review, now I know what not to buy from youRich"
2,Expected Better!,"After reading the reviews, I expected a disk full of creative efforts like Tainted Love. What I got was uninspired, drab drum-machining silly synthesized song after song...except for Tainted Love and their remixes. Yes, this is a great song, but you might as well get the single because there isn't another song on this CD that's close to it in quality."
1,now I know,"After listening to the entire cd I threw it away.Now I know why they were a one hit wonder.Tainted Love is the only redeeming point of the entire album.The rest is alot of droning, shrieking and obvoius attempts to sound either anguished or in heat."
3,Very loud whistle - sounds like a train,"When water is hot to the stage of the whistle going off, the water doesn't pour well. I pour over the sink so as not to spill on everything else."
4,It's okay,"In the 70s I had a cookbook called 365 Ways to Cook Hamburger. Hubby thought this book might be it. I should have taken a hint from the title.Still, it is a good cookbook. It arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. The first recipe I tried, for pork wontons, had 3 men asking for seconds. Can't go wrong with that."
4,adjustable slippers,"I bought these slippers for my mother-in-law who has rheumatoid arthritis. Her feet are deformed with bone growths on the tops and bottoms. She needs a flat bottom slipper, not cushioned which causes instability. The adjustable top of the slipper let her set the velcro to the exact opening she needed for each foot as the shape of each foot is different. I also bought a pair for myself because I thought the quality was very good and I don't like the cushioned slippers."
5,Excellent product,Very attractive and comfortable and easily adjusted with the Velcro strap. I definitely would order this brand and model again and would recommend it to any woman.
2,Something wrong with the sizing,"I have worn Daniel Green slippers for years and loved them to the point of tatters, but these are huge on me as far as width goes. I have been a 6 narrow for some 60 years, and these slippers are definitely non-fitting."
3,"Comfortable and soft, not too durable","I like this product, the sole is wearable outside, which is nice. The actual fabric is already breaking down and I've only had them a month. Overall they are nice but I think a little on the pricy side. I bought a pair of slippers at Target for half the money and they lasted 2-3 years. These will likely need to be replaced in 6-9 months."
4,not bad at all!,good purchase.. stays intact after washing... get a dark color though.. discoloration from wear will NOT quite go away after washing... but this is no fault of the manufacturerGood purchase!
2,WAY TOO OVERPRICED FOR SIMPLE SLIPPER,ALTHOUGH THESE WERE A GIFT FOR MY GRANDMOTHER SHE WAS DELIGHTED HOW THEY ARRIVED AND WERE WRAPPED. HOWEVER THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE $50.OO I PAID FOR THEM. THEY ARE MERELY A HOUSE SLIPPER THAT YOU CAN GET AT TARGET (OR A STORE LIKE THIS) FOR LESS THAN $20!
4,The Moe you know the Moe you understand!,"I read it when I was a Teen. It has inspired my actions since. What we get from our nations is something between what we want and what we give plus or minus the actions of all the participants. If you don't vote you don't deserve to complain! Also, you need to live as you vote. May I also recommend, ""A Man Called Intrepid"" by William Stevenson a Ballantine /Nonfiction."
4,Ignore Mike!,This may not be his best but it's still incredible. 'Nah Go A Jail' is good to light up too. 'No Nuclear War' can be updated and would fit right in today with the ever-present Imperialist objectives of the U.S. 'In My Song' and 'Testify' are praise songs to Jah and 'Lessons In My Life' is one of his best works. It's a perfect song to bring closure to a long and difficult journey. It's not easy to listen to 'Lessons' and not be saddened.
1,Very Weak cd,"The only reason to get this cd is if you already own all of Peter Tosh's other cds and you just want to experience all of his music. It is a very watered down reggae album. The remake of ""Apartheid"" is terrible. It's like he was looking for a hit song that would play well in the U.S. The original version on the album ""Equal Rights"" is amazing. The whole cd sounds like he either lost his edge or he was just looking for a crossover cd. It kills me to say all of this because I am a huge fan of Peter Tosh. If you are looking for a cd of Peter Tosh do yourself a favor and get ""Equal Rights"", ""Legalize It"" or ""Mama Africa"". ""Wanted Dread & Alive"" and ""Bush Doctor"" are also very good cds."
5,Peter Tosh's Final Masterpiece,"My first Reggae album.....I went from Black Sabbath to Peter And Bob almost overnight, and spent the next ten years listening to almost nothing but Reggae Music! It's hard for me to pick one Tosh album and say ""This one is the best"" cuz they're all killer!But this is probably my favorite for more reasons than the music though. Mama Africa is up there too!ME NAH GO TO JAIL FOR THE GANJA....CUZ I BOUGHT IT FROM AN OFFICER....I think it may have been those very words that did it for me.I cant believe nobody has rated this cd??? Every song on it is great, especially the last one....Vampire. Buy this cd, if you dont love it then you got serious problems mon!& If your new to Reggae, it's a perfect place to start. Peter Tosh was one of the coolest people to EVER walk this planet and every thing he touched is gold.....Jah Rastafari Long live Rashaad Muhamed, Bobby Hardin, and Peter Tosh! Oh yeah & Free Mumia!"
2,oh god wut have i done?????,"all i gotta say is this..... SAVE yer money, don't buy this. spend yer money on sumthin like 'kill your idols' or 'good riddance' or ANYTHING other than this crap..... oh yeah, i gave it 2 stars 'cause the first song's ok, but it gets old real quick"
5,An Amazing Live Set,"This CD has great tracks selection and the mix is perfect. When I play this cd, I have to play the whole album. tracks are bounded together so well in this CD and there is no where in this CD that I can press stop button and stop the music. The whole album is just an amazing trace experience. Trust me, this CD is worth getting."
3,Should have listened to the other reviewers,This book was ok. Just ok. We are looking into buying a small RV. There was not much info in this book that was not more than common sense.
3,These sound fine,3 STARS because these are his early works.To me his early music did not sound that great to me.But this is a bargain.These are rarely heard music.Also these are not easy to get.
2,Not the Walk I Remember,"I own a single (45 RPM) of the title selection, A Walk in the Black Forest, performed by Horst Jankowski; the one on the CD is a different and disappointing recording."
2,The end,"I have always liked Spalding and as a Irish person was interested on his take on Ireland (even under awful circumstances). But, it was sadly wanting. He did not understand Ireland or the Irish at all. It was the classic ""oirish"" interpretation of things. Disappointing. The main piece is a very short part of the book, the rest are eulogies of different sorts from his pals. But, the discontinuities between the two pieces lead you to question the latter."
2,"Boring R&B, a point out of the curve for Hubbard","The late Freddie Hubbard is still a Jazz icon through his records nearly all available in CD, mainly now that Wounded Bird Records decided to reissue what was missing in CD format, his string of Rhythm & Blue albums for Columbia Records in the 70s after his spectacular series for Blue Note and for CTi Records.The Columbia material does not show the best Hubbard but does show the usual great trumpeter we are all used to listening to.All material in 'Liquid Love' is neglectable for Jazz audiences."
3,red sox shirt,the quality seemed good in as far as the color and graphics. However it seemed to run a bit small and the long sleeves were very short in length.
3,A Colorful Lightweight,"I've been a fan of Margolies since his first book, and I ordered this with high expectations.Unfortunately, this book is almost completely advertisements and memorabia. There is very little narrative. Like another reviewer, I was quite disappointed that there was only a sketchy outlining of the various transitions that motels have progressed through over the generations. I got the impression that Mr. Margolies probably had most of these old brochures, cards, maps, etc., and simply assembled these in a chronological format.On the other hand, if you are a fan of Margolies's photography, his own photographs in the book match his earlier photographic achievements.This book is probably worth the price of admission, but I'd like to see a more comprehensive history of twentieth-century hospitality industry."
3,GIANTS 6 PACK OF PENCILS,"they are sturdy pencils and my grandson, a Giants fan, really liked them.He will be a bigh hit with the boys at school"
3,similar to 12 o'Clock High,"Good movie if you like the older post WWII movies, especially if you liked 12 O'Clock high. Clark Gable is very good in this one."
2,uninspiring acting,"What struck me most about this movie is the uninspiring acting. Many times it seemed that the actors were just reading their scripts. Little or no emotion and empathy; they didn't become their characters. Clark Gable included.For example, the plane that was coming in for a landing with both pilots injured or dead. I believe the navigator was flying. The tone of his voice was like Ben Stein. If you're not used to flying a plane, it's all shot-up, and your crew is dead/injured, then you're probably a bit on edge. This fella sounded as bored and nonchalant as can be.In my opinion,Twelve O'Clock High (Special Edition)is a MUCH better movie. Superb acting. And it has to do with the same kind of war situation.Command Decision was so lackluster that I dozed off a couple of times; and near the end (maybe 20 minutes left), I just turned it off, because I didn't care how it ended.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on ""Listmania! Lists""."
3,Disappointed,I have always liked this movie for its intensity and historic value. The acting is first-rate. It is an excellent study on the heavy responsibility of command. Unfortunately this version has several minutes cut out of it. I saw it recently on Turner Classic Movies and those minutes were included in their version.
2,Not what I expected,"Sound quality on this is horrible... I expected better and for it not to sound like I was watching the movie in a tunnel. Also, the sub-titles do not work and there are no extra features on the DVD. I expected the movies thenselves to be in just like they would be on a regular dvd and that since there was less packaging they were able to sell them at this price... I mean you get the idea of the movie but it was still less that great. I wont buy another of these 3 movies in one deals..."
4,Good movies,"Than you the movies are very nice only I think maybe had spanish subtitles but no problem, thanks very good"
2,Not what I expected,"These jazz shoes are the kind that easily scuff and wear. The leathery outside rubs away easily, leaving a greenish scuff underneath. They probably won't be very durable for much longer. Also, I couldn't tell in the picture, but this is the kind that does not have the fabric middle. It is leather all the way from toe to ankle."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!!,"I purchased this exact shoe (Capezio) only to receive a brand called Dance Now. The description said to order your normal street size. This is wrong. You need to order at least a half size, if not a whole size larger. I ordered them for my daughter and they are too small. I am real disappointed. I am now stuck with a shoe that my daughter has to wear too small."
3,Too Light!!!,"I have compared Wusthof and Henkels for awhile now and would have been happy with either ""true"" knife sets by these companies. This set on the Emeril line is not true Wusthof quality. The blades are thinner than my cheap Target set that I was replacing and the handles are plastic with the blade seemingly glued into place. I also bought the steak knife set and those did not even fit into the block they were meant to be in. I was not able to hold and feel these before I bought them, but the price was right ..... I thought! They'll keep me semi happy for the next few years but next time I'll make sure I get the real deal Wusthof."
3,Too light for me,"These knives were too light for me. The blades are super thin, and very sharp indeed, but the handle doesn't feel sturdy in my hand. I think I prefer something with more weight and substance. The handles are a lightweight, honed plastic. No chiseled edge in the cut of the handle. Something about that design and material choice for the handles contributes to my feeling that these knives are a little cheap. A friend of mine has the Wüsthof Gourmet set and I've always enjoyed using her knives. I think I'll get those after I return these."
3,Brighter blues,"They hardly hit it on the head like their hit hit our heads, but few straight classic blues-rock units swung with this much, if any, integrity."
5,Groundbreaking pre-woodstock genius,"Remastered from the original LP, an absolute masterpiece of the R&B sound that so fueled the flower power generation. The 41 minute version of Refried Boogie still makes the speakers come alive."
5,Canned Heat were HOT !,"I saw Canned Heat in concert many times during this era.....and perform all these songs in their entirety......incl. that one, "" SANDY'S BLUES "".Bob "" The Bear "" Hite was the best bandleader and could really whip a huge crowd into a blues frenzy.Tireless promotion of the blues, by Canned Heat, Paul Butterfield, John Mayall, Michael Bloomfield, and Eric Burdon during the late ""60s"", helped invigorate national interest in blues music."
3,Somewhat informative but there must be better out there,"A good and necessary book with lots of food for thought but it sometimes seems more like a precursor to a real debate - defining terms and worldviews - versus an argument for each position. Or perhaps it's rather like a post-debate conversation. The arguments have been hashed out for decades and are taken as givens by the writers, so they're moving on to philosophical topics. But the average reader would like to hear the evidence, please!I also miss the round-robin rebuttal system used in the other books in this terrific series. The third party panel of critics are a distraction and are not clearly identified or categorized. They take up useful space that could used by the primary essayists to, well, present their case!"
2,A partial effort that falls short of the mark,"This is an excellent book with very well reasoned arguments and analysis. But it has one profound defect. It only deals with three theories of origins: young earth creationism, old earth creationism, and theistic evolution. The most important theory of all -- naturalistic evolution -- is not included. Yet the latter is the theory that is accepted by essentially all earth and biological scientists."
5,Playing Dead,"I thought this video was an extremely original portrayal of good verses evil. I found myself engrossed in the deceptive nature of Bobby's character (played by Mark Hanson), and I was not about to leave for popcorn. This suspense thriller will have you wondering how will it end, and who will be the one left to pay the consequences. This movie reminds me of the unique, gothic nature of The Crow."
5,The suspence was exciting,"Great movie, excellent acting and truly a movie that sets you at the edge of your seat. I can't wait till friends see it, as we are all fans of this suspence type movie and it's good to see the quality of direction and acting that is in PLAYING DEAD. I will recommend this movie to others."
2,New and Unoriginal Burnett has done it again,"From the man who brought us Survivor (well he produced it even if he did not create it) The Eco Challenge (well he produced that too even if he did not invent Expedition Racing) And was an Airborne wannabe...... Comes a book.... Well nothing new in the book in terms of life strategy, but hey it looks like he paraphrases really well.....There are more and much better books on this subject out there. This one smacks of huckster...."
4,A Man Whose Life Parallels His Shows,"It's easy to slam Mark Burnett. He's freaking rich, he's changed the way television does business, and he doesn't seem to make a wrong move careerwise. But unlike other self-help authors who use adventure anecdotes without having any experience of their own, Burnett has put himself out there. I was surprised to see that he was on the front lines in the Falklands War, finished ninth in the Raid Gauloises, and personally scouts each Survivor location and pre-runs each Eco-Challenge course. The guy's not a wanna-be, he's the real deal. His words on success are worth reading."
4,It worked for Mark Burnett!,"I'm wondering if ""Mooresville, NC"" even read this book. It sounds to me like he has a personal issue with Mr. Burnett. I might have taken heed in his/her review if it actually said something about the content of the book. I'm on chapter four, and I personally see Burnett's life-view refreshing. Unlike other self-help/success stories I've witnessed, so far I see no signs of self-pity or ""martyrism"". Burnett seems to sincerely appreciate whatever opportunities he's had in life. Obviously, he's doing something right to have created/produced Eco-Challenge and produced ""Survivor"". So far, I find his success strategies enlightening. They may not be profound, but at least we know for sure that they worked for him!"
4,The Story of an Adventurer,"Below is Mark's philosophy, and this book is the story of how he lived his success:1.) Only results count2.) Have the courage to fail3.) Choose teammates wisely4.) Perseverance produces character5.) Be right or be wrong, but make a decision6.) Set achievable goals7.) Try to go above, beyond, and then even further.Mark writes how his life didn't go as planned, and while he received some big breaks, they were more about positioning himself to receive them and make them happen than simply luck. If he wasn't willing to try anything, he'd have let opportunities pass.It's a good read. The man was a soldier, a nanny, a t-shirt seller, an insurance agent, a credit card banker, a three times competitor in the Raid Gauloises, the producer and scouter for the Eco-Challenge race, and finally the mastermind behind Survivor. He's accomplished a great deal, and if you don't care about the philosophy, the stories are still interesting."
5,Perfect fit for our family,"Positive and written to help children understand a new addition to the family and also adjust. Includes helpful tips for parents. Includes nursing, co-sleeping, and babywearing. The perfect choice for the attachment minded family!"
5,My toddler loves it!,"I have a 26 month old and a 2 month old and my toddler really enjoys reading this book. I love that it promotes breastfeeding - difficult to find books that do. Good illustrations, nice pace, and concrete ideas for my toddler."
5,What sister or brother needs to prepare for baby,"This nicely illustrated book is written by a doctor and nurse. Along with notes for parents and caregivers to maximize a positive experience in bringing baby home; the accompanying text and pictures are a great springboard for preparing a child for the birth of a sibling. The illustrations are simple enough for a toddler to relate to. The book emphasizes things an older child can do like ride a tricycle, play on the monkey bars with dad and more. The last page of the book contains several resources for the expectant parent."
3,Not for Young (2 and under) Children,"I didn't find anything that described the age-range that this book is for, but it was certainly not for young children (2 and under). My son is 17 months old and the baby will arrive when he is 21 months. There is too much text in this book for a young child. I wanted to like it b/c it's Dr. Sears but truthfully, I don't. Out of the picture books we bought my son for this transition, the only age-appropriate one was ""My New Baby"" by Rachel Fuller. Also a bonus, My New Baby also has the baby breastfeeding :-)"
1,disappointing,"After I'd bought several John Denver CD's, this book was recommended by Amazon.com - and as the author has said in his review, above, it's not a biography. Don't be fooled! I was expecting some new information and insight into John's life and what I got was a rather slushy synopsis of his obvious philosophy, which would be clear to anyone who'd ever listened to his lyrics. Unless you're content with superficial observations, it isn't worth the $14.95. Sorry, Roger..."
3,Pretty good...,"This is a pretty good book...it kept my attention and had enough pull to take me out of the real world for a time. Just one warning, however--do not go into this book expecting it to have very much to do with Arthurian legend!"
4,Indoor grill,Just got this product. Easy clean up.Lightweight.I've never had an indoor grill before; so it is hard to compare. Cooks with less heat than outside grill - slower.Saving 5 rating for more use.
5,Great product,This is a great product. I rarely use my gas fired grill anymore. It's very easy to clean as well. Several of my friends purchased them and they love them as well. I have not had a problem with insufficient heat as reported elsewhere. The adjustable heat control works fine. All in all we are very satisfied with this grill.
1,Buy Something Else!,Spend your money on another grill. It does not get very hot! It takes forever to cook.
1,All inuendo no depth,"I purchased this book. Book is shallow with no depth. Dan Briody clearly does not know the Carlyle Group, its principals or anything else. What a waste of time and money."
2,Smear Campaign?,"I'll be the first to admit that the Carlyle Group seems to ""work"" the system...perhaps even abuse it to profit from their ""connections"" to goverment. And yes, they've done a few thing most people would find to be inappropriate. However the author's case would have been much more compelling had he simply stated the facts and not editorialized so much. The result makes you feel like it's a crackpot conspiracy theory. His liberal use of adjectives and obvious melodrama to make us think something horribly sinister is afoot made me bitter toward journalists, rather than his intended target, the Carlyle Group. Typical of the news media today: he couldn't just report the facts...he had to color it with his political (or paranoid) biases."
2,A journo book full of factual mistakes,"The hardcover has some typos, and some glaring factual mistakes that makes the reader wonder what else is wrong; for example, ""Congo, now called Zaire"" (wrong: it's DROC- Demo Repub of the Congo).Other such factual mistakes abound.Full of rumor and skuttlebutt, but nothing really concrete or even shocking (for example: there are numerous conflicts of interest in the Iron Triangle of Congress-Business-Defense Dept--- whoopdee doo!)A typical journalist rush to market book. Even the short 10 page ""chapters"" reflect this."
1,Iliterate writer and editors,"This is ,without comenting on the content,is one of the most poorly written books in the current catalogs.Our concern should be focused on the educational system that turns writers, editors and publishers loose to clutter our intellects with this stuff."
5,EXCELLENT,Investigative reporting at it's best. Very well written.I would highly recommend this book.
2,Review,I have to say the book was not as good as I thought it would be and on review would not purchase again.
2,Inside from the Outside,"This book was extremely disappointing. Though it's subtitled ""Inside the Secret World of the Carlyle Group"", the author never actually gets inside the company. In fact, he plainly states that anyone even remotely associated with the Carlyle Group refused to speak with him. What he provides, instead, is a summary of the any public news clippings about the Carlyle Group in the last 15 years and a lot of supposition and speculation about what was going on behind the scenes while the news was happening.On top of the lack of data and facts in the story, the author tends to repeat himself, describing the same situation over and over again, often using the same language.Overall, there's not a lot of meat to this book."
2,Vast Left Wing Conspiracy,"First, this book is not for business types. The book glances over the financial details of every deal. Only midway through do you even get a hint of the group's profitability- rumored at 46% year over year.Second, the author is very biased. He uses so much innuendo and makes so many slippery slope arguments, that I am unsure what is true and what is conjecture.Ultimately, if you are an anti-globalist, this book is for you. Believe me, all your fantasies are confirmed in this book. If you are a level headed, this book isn't worth the time or money."
3,Biased at Best,"It was interesting to get some history on Carlyle, but towards the end of the book the author's bias becomes laughable.While his conclusion is that Carlyle benefited from September 11, he ignores the massively offsetting hit Carlyle's non-defense portfolio companies took as a result of the events. I would bet they were net losers on the day and its aftermath.I don't think Carlyle's non-cooperation on this book justifies extrapolating the most extreme conclusions from the few facts and innuendos available. At a minimum more research was required."
1,Nauseating,"Just when I thought What Should I Do With My Life was the worst business book of the year comes this truly nauseating ""examination"" of the Carlyle Group. When people think negatively of me living in NYC, it's often because they imagine people living the life so carefully dissected in this smarmy book. The big question is: why would people CARE about the inside story of this nasty organization? When will books celebrating the successes of humanitarian organizations get the marketing dollars the publisher is devoting to this nasty piece of s--- get?"
4,Fun and spicy,"Good ""People Magazine"" version of the Carlyle story. While there are lots of critical / negative biases and it paints a pretty incomplete / on sided canvas, it's a good read for anyone that wants insight into how private equity works, especially with high impact players."
3,Where the Risk-Averse Put Their Money,"A decent work to give the reader a perspective of how the real, low risk money is being made. An eye-opener for those, who believe that everyone has a chance and another sample oftrickle down economics. Unfortunately the piece is short ofdocumentary evidence. Perhaps it is the nature of the beast thatno trails are left."
1,Don't waste your money,"This movie was such a waste of my time even watching it. It definitely is not worth the price. I know these kinds of movies are not the greatest and I was not expecting excellence, but I was expecting it to be somewhat believable and enjoyable to watch but it was a big let down."
3,3 HOT GIRLS!!!,"If you're feeling like a silly and stupid B movie, then you can't go wrong with this movie. Nothing too ponder here. You got your below-average story line, dumb casts' of characters, and cheesy-looking graphics and your dumb looking shark. That's the whole movie.I basically liked the 3 hot white girls they have in the movie and that's basically it. Everything else isn't worth noting here. If you just want to see something to kill time and relax to I recommend this."
2,Ethnocentric Photoessay,"The book is a short and biased introduction to European-based history in the area. It only briefly mentions the Pomo and Wappo history, which is infinitely longer than the European one, it also ""whitewashes"" the Indian extinction in the area as being solely caused by disease, which is only partially true, nor does it mention the government sanctioned killing of the Pomo that went on all around the area or their subsequent removal off their native lands to unsuitable local reservations. There are interesting photos, and granted, the historical photographic evidence of slaughter may be hard to come by, however, the brutal history definitely deserved a mention, to be fair. My review may be biased, but so is this nice, tourist friendly photo essay claiming to be a history."
4,Good Reference,This is a great reference tool to be used in conjunction with other Illustrator References.
3,Average rating for an ok book,"I thought this book would have had more illustration tips and ""how to's"", but there wasn't very many. Most of the examples were to brief to really follow or duplicate. I've been using Illustrator since ver 5.0 and found the book slightly dissapointing because of the lack of depth. While I can't say it won't help others out there, I can't reccomend the purchase to someone who's been using it for years."
3,A beautiful book but...,"When I first got this book I was excited by the beautiful graphics contained between its glossy covers. I still drool over them. But, for an old Photoshop hand trying to venture into the wonderful world of vector art, this book didn't open that door. I guess I've been spoiled by Gary Bouton's books teaching Photoshop. Please Gary won't you write a book for Illustrator. If you want to see what Illustrator can do buy this book; just don't expect to have it teach you how to do it."
4,"Good overview, great tips and tricks","This book and CD give a good overview of the ""finger dances"" required to do the more intricate functions of I8.0 and does a great job of showing how to implement those tools new and old to create interesting and attractive new pieces."
3,Not exactly the sturdiest thing in the world,"I needed a large squeegee, and liked the idea of combining it with a push broom so I didn't have to have two separate pieces of equipment. Unfortunately it's not very well made, and I don't think it's going to last very long before it falls apart. I'm not going to be throwing out my plain push broom after all..."
5,This item is only good when outdoors.,Ive purchase this product because if me not getting all of the action of a game or a party that has every one gathering around friends/family to get their picture or video on my PC. The real part I like to mostly use it for is to get the action of the little one's thow down on a football game or into a frenzy fight where everyone is arguing over the game or see their hats and hair piece jackets rips off when they get into it. so that way Ive have all of them on camera and video to show them.
3,I would not want to depend on this alone.,"It does what it's supposed to do -- jack up the car. Not all road surfaces are flat, this is a ""skinny little thing"" which could become unstable fast -- I don't want it to suddenly tip over while I'm anywhere near it. So, I always use backup -- i.e., jackstands and chock(s), because this bottle jack has a small base, a very small contact point, and -- because it's hydraulic, a leak could make it go down real fast."
2,Does the job,Cheap but does perform basic function. Holes in the base to mount for better stability would be nice. No frills on this jack.
5,An' somehow my th'oat gits choky,"Paul Laurence Dunbar is a rare gem. Something to be treasured for all time. His poetry is so honest and pure, so revealing that it is almost painful to read.Poems of Cabin and Field moved me in ways hard to describe. I was hit from three intimate directions at once. I am a poet, this is the heart of poetry. I am an historian, this is living, breathing history. Lastly, but first by nature, I am a Southerner, and this is as Southern as it gets.Dunbar's work is a masterpiece. My favorite was ""The Deserted Plantation,"" which is the very kernel of Southern history itself, though it is hard to choose any single line over another in these wondrous gifts of soul. It is so refreshing to dip in this sparkling wellspring of the South.May Dunbar and his Poems of Cabin and Field be remembered always."
5,Excellent version,"I have Vols 1 & 2 of the Aurora Quartet Naxos set and recommend them highly. The playing is expressive and technically this California ensemble is top notch. I often have problems with the quality of the Naxos label recordings. I'm happy to say this is not a problem with this set of recordings. By way of comparison, I have the Ysaye Quartet recording of Opp 12, 13 and 80 as well. The Ysaye are good and often exciting but sometimes astringent. Let's let my actions do the talking: I listen to the Aurora set almost exclusively now."
4,Easy to read textbook. lots of real-life examples.,"Thick and heavy. Not too hard to read. Good for graduate-level work. A little more expensive than other text books I've purchased but affordable as far as text books go. Chapters aren't unreasonably long. Overall, I'd recommend this book."
2,"Interesting Concept, Flawed Execution","They say this is for small dogs, unfortunately, the ""bone"" is about an inch thick, which makes it a little hard for my small dog (pug, and a larger pug at that) to get his mouth around it and benefit from the brushes. The brushes are recessed, with only a quarter inch or so sticking out from the plastic casing. The thing that really got to me about this product though, is that it did not come with doggy toothpaste. You'd think it would, since they show it in the picture, but nope, had to order that separately. My dog shows absolutely no interest in this thing now, maybe he will once I get the toothpaste."
2,Not worth the money,"This product looks like it would be very durable but it falls apart very quickly. I got the small/medium for my 15 lb Westie and she has absolutely destroyed it...taken chunks out of the plastic/pulled out all the bristles. Even with taking it away after a few mins, it only last maybe 3 uses. I also bought the large for my 72lb German Shepherd and she just acts like she doesn't know what to do with it. She just carries it around and licks off the toothpaste. I thought this was a really good idea but it really will depend on if your dog uses it in a way to make it actually clean their teeth."
1,"No, no, NO!","Purchased as a replacement. Original was fine, but this come out of package with bristles falling out. No way I am putting this in my dog's mouth."
1,A disappointment,"I ordered this book thinking it would be insightful, current and packed with wonderful glossy photos. It is a very thin book and seems out dated. It looks like something you could pick up at [local retailer] for no more than [a few bucks]... or free. A real disappointment."
1,Simply written,The articles were direct re-writes from a poorly written trade magazine. Very little product sourcing is mentioned.--- Sal Versaggi
1,Not worth it.,"I love concrete and using it in innovative ways. This is a technical book for people who want to stamp designs into sidewalks. It is an accurate and helpful book if this is what you are doing, however. For me it didn't do much."
4,The Pajama Game Is The Game Were In,"This is a great classic Warner Brothers Hit. It is based on the Broadway Hit Pajama Game. When Warner Brothers bought the rights to the story, they used almost all of the origional cast, except that they included Doris Day is put in as the role of Kate""Babe"" Williams. This is a great movie full of laughs, and and gags. John Raitt, Eddie Foy Jr., and Reta Shaw lead the cast. And you have a special treat in store. This song also has a lot of great songs such as Hernandos Hideaway, Steam Heat, and many more. If you want a good movie for the whole family. Pajama Game is the movie for you. This is a great clean movie that you can show to the whole family. So if you havn't alreaddy seen Rent or Buy The Pajama Game today."
3,Doris is the reason to watch,"Despite having most the players from the Tony-winning Broadway musical intact, the reason to watch the movie-version of ""The Pajama Game"" is Doris Day. With her no-nonsense bob and freckly-sunniness, she lights up this stale plot about trouble within a pajama factory. Bob Fosse helped with the dance numbers, but his distinct talents are in evidence on only one number(""Steam Heat"", which is great but looks a little out of place in these old-fashioned surroundings). Movie doesn't pop or sizzle, it could use more movement and jazzy interaction, but when it does contain these elements, it feels very fresh and featherweight. And, as always, Doris makes the most of it. B-"
4,"It's a really bad plot, but good songs","It's a really bad plot, really thin characters, and mostly (except for the Fosse numbers), unimaginative choreography. But it's got great music and some personable stars."
4,Has to be the best movie musical ever set in a pajama factory,"This movie is pleasant enough and has some great songs and athletic dancing. The plot is outdated nonsense though I'm sure even in the 50's viewers realized that this was a Broadway musical on film not a hard hitting documentary on working conditions in sewing factories. The supporting characters are great and there are some laugh out loud moments. I love John Raitt's singing voice as Sidney. Doris Day is fine playing Babe as pretty much the same character Doris always played in her light comedies and musicals of the 50's and 60's. I think some of the lyrics and lines may have been ""cleaned up"" from the Broadway show but it is much truer to the original show then a lot of filmed musicals."
5,The Taboo....is acceptable,"Only Doris Day could make this ""bedroomsie"" type movie G rated. A delightful, carefree style of life is portrayed in this ""Doris-classic"" movie. Anyone who loves her voice or beauty will enjoy this movie. Hollywood should return to making more movies like this one."
3,Pajama review,"Although I've waited many years for the underrated musical to go to VHS and then DVD, I have to admit that I've been somewhat disappointed. On VHS the Picture quality is very good, with sharp colors and contrast, the sound quality is also very good. My big dissappointment is on the CD. The picture quality is excellent, a step up, but the sound quality is poor. Some songs come across so low in volume that you have to adjust the sound to maximium while other songs can blast you out of the room. Listening to this CD is like trying to watch Cable at night when the program volume is set for an intimate room and commercials have their volume set for and a room the size of Madison Square Garden. THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT ON A CD FOR A MUSICAL! On a scale of 1-5 I rate the VHS a 4 but the CD a 2. Shame on you Warner Bros. for such inferior CD quality."
4,Slow starter,"I had a little problem getting the DVD started, but it did eventually and played satisfactorily."
4,Just a Classic Musical (loved the music),I remember watching this movie as a child and I must tell you it brought a smile to my face and a tap to my foot watching it as an adult. I did not realize how many of the songs I recognized. It was a trip down memory lane for me - and I totally enjoyed it!
4,Great musical!,"This musical is full of great music and dance. The only thing I didn't like was the use of ""water colors"" versus ""technicolor"". I am sure it was decided on for a creative alternative, but I would have preferred technicolor.Other than that, it is great."
2,PAJAMA WARNING,"JUST PURCHASED THAT LOVELY LIVLY MUSICAL THE PAJAMA GAME, BUT WHAT A TERRIBLE TRANSFER TO DVD, SO FARR IT IS THE WORST DVD I HAVE GOT IN MY COLLECTION. THE COLOURS AND THE VISION REGARDS FOCUS ARE FIRST CLASS HORRIBLE.I SHOULD HAVE PAYED MOORE ATTENTION TO OTHER REVIEWS, WARNER BROTHERS SHOULD IM SURE HAVE LEFT IT ON VHS. W/BROTHERS I FEEL SHOULD REFUND ME AND ANY ONE ELSE WHO THINKS THE SAME AS I DO.ANY WAY I AM LANDED WITH IT BUT CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SHOW IT OFF."
3,I'm disappointed there are no captions.,I was disappointed that there are no captions on this movie. I should have double checked before I purchased it.
4,Classic vintage Doris Day musical -- delightful!,"This is a fun movie, complete with pajama factory scenes (rows of women singing at their Singers) and labor union shenanigans. The song ""Hey there! You with the stars in your eyes"" came from this musical, and Miss Day is at her best in ""I'm Not At All in Love."" The tango ""Hernando's Hideaway"" will strike a familiar bell, too.Rated absolutely PG, fun for all ages."
3,Overblown,"If you like musicals, this is the movie for you. It is overblown with song and dance and short on story. But that's OK if it's what you like. It's just that there are other musicals that are better with more memorable songs.Another thing is Day's hairdo. Whoever was responsible for it should have been fired. Doris Day is a beautiful woman, and her hairdo made her look butch.They did a great job of restoring the color, though."
1,Like watching an AFL-CIO contract negotiation...,"I LOVE Doris Day, but would rank this film at the bottom of the list of her artistic endeavors. At times, I became embarrased by the movie, and felt awkward in that I had asked my wife to watch it with me. It is one dumb plot, never beginning to connect with even 1950 reality. Centered around making pajamas in a union shop, moronic management is fighting wimpy workers led by Doris Day (rightfully fired for performing industrial sabotage), who falls in love with one of the enemy managers, singing songs while prancing around the factory. I Love You Doris, and I believe you should buy up all existing copies of this film and burn them."
2,Not a sleeper,"I now know why I had not heard much about this movie. Only buy it if you like Broadway musicals because it is not your typical Doris Day movie. I feel like I am watching parts of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when the prince says ""I just want to sing""."
2,Doris Day in a pajama-factory musical.,"Very seldom seen Doris Day film. This one is a musical in color. Unusual and perhaps unattractive to watch because it is set in a shirt & pajama-making factory. Doris Day plays Babe Williams. She is the tough-cookie that's part of the grievence committee and goes by the rule book. After having to get both sides of the story after two men had a fight, the workers tease her that she will fall in love with the man she dislikes. But if you know any Doris Day film, she will be in love soon.I liked the railroad lot se and nighttime rain through the window is a nice shot. Not one of my favorite Doris Day films.Who on earth would want to live so close to the railroad tracks?One song you may recognize is ""Steam Heat"".May I suggestBilly Rose's Jumbo?"
3,boring,"I normally love musicals and Doris Day, but I found this movie boring. I thought some of the songs sounded tortured when they went out of their way to make a single word hit several notes. I also thought some of the choreography suffered from trying too hard and ended up with me wondering how the movements corresponded to the song. I liked the costumes- especially the flashes of contrasting crinolines. Day's figure is so perfect she almost looks like she can't be flesh and blood- simply beautiful! Her hair was another story. It was too short and stiff- it looked manly rather than her usual demure ingenue. Although I thought the leading man was nice to look at, having a much better body than most leading men of that era, he was also too stiff to be really attractive. I might have watched this movie on cable, but I regret buying the dvd."
3,no tbad,I bought this DVD because my daughter's school is putting this play on and I needed to see how the women dressed so I could purchase costumes. It's a cute story.
3,pajama game,interesting seeing how films change in their production style over the years. fun remembering some of the songs i had forgotten.
3,Disapponted,"I was disappointed it was not in Stereo, as I recall the VHS version was in Stereo, and I was very surprised the DVD was not, actually it was one of the reasons I purchased it."
2,Not my cup of tea,It was just not what I was expecting. It was totally different from any other Doris Day movie I have seen and I have seen alot.
3,The Pajama Game,Like musicals from the 50's then this is a great one to watch. This is a cute movie. Probably suited for the older crowd that really like musicals.
5,Brought back terrific memories.,"My high school put this on many, many years ago. Back then, musicals were lots of fun! We need more like this."
5,missing dvd cover,The store I bought it from didn't include the DVD cover with the package. I thought this was kind of cheesy.
2,Pajama Game,"Video was so so until half way through, then for about 5 minutes it became unwatchable. Bad DVD. Would not recommend purchase to anyone."
1,not worth it!,"I purchased this gum, hoping it would be a wonderfuland long lasting grape flavor but neither proved to be true."
4,john candy:comedy favorites,"Two out of the three in this box set are brilliant,had the whole family laughing,what with planes trains and automobiles these make the funniest films i have seen.Sadly though we actually turned off the third film in the box set `going berserk` as even john candy couldn`t make this film funny,it was awful."
1,Very Bad Very Slow!,I love Candy at his best these are really bad and should not be seen by anyone who holds the man in high regards.
5,Glad I bought it,"I bought this set because of the reviewer who said that ""Going Berserk"" was the funniest John Candy movie. I didn't know anything about this movie, but took his word for it. I'm glad I did. It's hysterical - the big plus is that Eugene Levy's comedic genius is equally evident in this film - I have been chuckling about his ""anger problem"" ever since I watched it last week. The video-ing of the wedding is not all that far off from some of the wedding videos I've been forced to watch - very very funny movie."
3,John Candy,"Well two out of three ain't bad. I thinkThe Great OutdoorsandUncle Buckare fun. AlthoughGoing Berserkmay have sounded funny on paper, it just doesn't make it. So if you don't have the first two DVDs, the set is still worth the price. Decent family comedies if you are a fan of John Candy. The best of Candy though I still think isPlanes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition). If that had been in this set or evenSummer Rentalinstead of ""Going Berserk"", and it would be a great set. Decent quality DVDs and fair replayability."
3,Best and Worst,"I ordered this set because I love Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors is Okay. I had never seen Going Berserk, but it was so awful, I'm sorry I didn't just stick with the single Uncle Buck."
4,Classic Candy,"These three classic John Candy movies is a great buy, I bought it mainly because of Uncle Buck, my favoritte John Candy movie ever.The great outdoors and Going berserk are great bonuses in this set."
4,Enjoyable!,"I saw both ""Uncle Buck"" and ""The Great Outdoors"" years ago and remebered them as being quite funny. Well, they still are and it was nice seeing them again. ""Going Berserk"" on the other hand would not count among my favorite John Cany movies. Kind of silly/stupid. Yet the DVD set was worth the price just for the first two. I know sometimes down the road I will certainly watch them again!"
4,Great inside look of a formula one team,"This is my first kindle ebook purchase and I have to say I enjoyed the book to a great extent.Steve definitely knows how to write and convey his thoughts (especially his personal thoughts) in an informative and open-minded way. I was a little supprised on how much a formula one mechanic actually makes, but consider the year he had worked in the industry and inflations, etc., I guess it's a fair amount given the criteria. One thing I would've like to see was the different countries and cities Steve had travelled with the team. But the fact that during a typical race weekend, the team really doesn't have any time to waste other than working on the car. However, a world tour of different cities and culturals would be nice. As I share some of the same feeling about working and life in general with the author.Overall,I enjoyed the book and looking forward to read some of other works from the author."
3,Struggled to get of the starting line and never really made an impression.,"Sorry, but this was not a good book to read. I understand it is based on true life and is the author's first or second effort at writing a book, however I really expected to learn more about the workings of a team. The one take away from this book is the chronic lack of sleep on the Grand Prix circuit for the traveling mechanics.I expected some more drama or feelings in the writing, but this did not materialize.Sky61"
2,The Mechanic's Tale,"I was hoping for, perhaps even expecting, a book that had some mechanical/technical detail of the intensely complex Formula One cars, having been written by a mechanic on a very well respected team. That is not, however, what I found.The author seemed to work hard to convey the 'feel' of the sport rather than provide any detail of the cars themselves - seeming at times to present more of a social auto-biography than anything else: I was not interested in the man, I was interested in his job.I am not sure that I would recommend this to anyone interested in the mechanical/technical side of the sport - it has really missed the mark."
3,For Serious Fans Only,I would have preferred more about the nuts and bolts of F1 and less about the author's career. The book seems to be targeted at serious F1 fans who want every scrap of information possible on the sport - not readers like me.
4,If at first you don't succeed.............................,"What did I expect from this book? Information, entertainment (always) and an insight into the life surrounding Formula 1.What did I get from the book? Information, entertainment and insight into Formula 1. It was such an easy read, some may say too easy but it was great to have a book that I could pick up and put down at will without having to remember where the story was going. A text book it is not but I sure understand a lot more of the life in and around F.1."
4,An entertaining F1 read,"Finally, a book about life in F1 that looks at the mechanics and operations side of this business. Enjoyable story telling, without the reader being led down overly technical back alleys of the sport. Having enjoyed Steve's commentary for years on SpeedTV, I'm hoping for a sequel to this work that might cover the next 10 years of Steve's career from 1997 to the present."
3,"Has Flax, so we can't use it.","Seems to be a good product, but we can not use it as our dog is allergic to flax and this product contains Flax."
4,It's fun to pla... er ... consult with,"I was originally thinking of just getting the ""Ask Yoda"" version of the toy, but I found that this version has the ""Ask Yoda"" feature, PLUS 4 other interactions. It's too cool to NOT buy one.I think an option to reprogram the sayings by sending new sayings to it would be even cooler. I want my Yoda to combine the wisdom of Billy Bob Thornton and throw out lines from ""Sling Blade"" for those 'special' occasions (maybe if I double click his hand...)Anyway, if you're getting an exective desk toy, you might consider the simpler ""Ask Yoda"". If you're getting a toy for someone under 20, get this one. And if you work for an executive under 20, quick shopping amazon and get back to work :-)The only drawback of the new version is that it takes C size batteries, not the more universal 'AA' battery."
2,Buy Gerald Clarke's Biography of Truman Capote Instead,"I read this as a supplement to Gerald Clarke's very well written biography on Truman Capote. Plimpton hasn't written a book here, it's just a compilation of quotes from people who knew Truman. Sure, it took some research, but beyond that there's no skill involved and it's not a book I'd want to sit and read the entirety of. Had I been able to scan the book prior to purchase I would not have bought it. I highly recommend Gerald Clarke's biography of Truman Capote if you want a well written, in depth understanding of the man."
4,A Must-Read For Any Southern Lit Lover!,"Plimpton's style for this book makes it a quick pageturner that I couldn't put down. It is a total reflection of Capote's own character, very open and even gossipy. Tons of facts (or opionions) that I had never known before. A ""tru"" inside look at who Truman really was, and this book was the later inspiration for what was to become my own email address. I wish there had been more info on Denham Fouts, an interesting character with influence in the lives of many writers of this time, including Gore Vidal, Christopher Isherwood, and Capote. If you loved A Christmas Memory or In Cold Blood, then read this book just to find out those behind the scene details. Totally amazing!!"
5,Exceptional seller,"Got the book I wanted in a timely fashion, with no fuss, no muss! Will happily do business with these folks again and again."
3,"Interesting curiosity, but only somewhat useful","I tend to like this old fashioned way of displaying natural objects, with each illustrated plate having the look of an odd collection of curiosities one might find in an old museum display. BUT... the dimensions of the book -- and the type font size -- are about half as big as they should be. Two demerits for that. After all, it is to some degree an art book.Also, this book is not to be confused with a nature identification guide. Some of the illustrations are very accurate, some okay, and a few others not so accurate. It's a smattering of arthropods somewhat organized into appropriate scientific groups, and occasionally stuck together more for the creativity of it. This is a suitable nature-book-o-phile's book, but there are better places to put your money if you're into studying creepy crawlie critters."
5,Great book!,"A good story to read, very romantic and funny at the same time... Loved it when Francine taught the knights to change their habits and teaching manners. If I can go back in time, ohhh man I think I would love it, if I had to replay the story with the dashing knight :0)"
2,Don't Bother,"A clever idea, but I found the main character hard to relate to -- maybe it was all that hairspray the author kept referring to at the beginning. It occurred to me more than once that if any woman (or man for that matter) with this gal's attitude was transported back in time as she was, she would have been murdered before the end of the first chapter for being so obnoxious. If you found yourself with a copy, save it for bathroom reading."
3,Useful contribution,"Johnson in this commentary offers a sustained and well articulated ""reading"" of Romans; though at times he can be a little idiosyncratic in his views and labour some points endlessly. He is very good in focusing on the literary conventions of this letter, but not so good when it comes to exegetical detail. One glaring weakness that this work has is that it does not interact with alternative readings or views in a sustained or consistant way. Another shortcoming is that it contains no indexes or bibliographies! Thus, I would say that this should not be top of your list when it comes to purchasing commentaries on Romans. For roughly the same price you can get Douglas Moo's larger and more exhaustive commentary in the New International Commentary on the New Testament series, or if you are looking for a Roman Catholic perspective, Brendon Bryne's volume in the Sacra Pagina series.Nevertheless, this volume does contain some exegetical distinctives."
4,One of the greats forgotten,"This is a quality rock album from a classic band that didnt get nearly enough recognition(like the michael stanley band).The music is melodic,edgy and fun.Great scratchy Rod Stewart like vocals and searing crunchy guitars.The bands first release,the previous ""Artful Dodger"" is a notch hotter than this one but this one follows suit with no shame at all.""Honor among Thieves"" will be sure to please anyone with an appetite for the rock classics.The song ""Scream"" is a melodic and emotion provoking acoustic rock ballad that is a high point on the album."
4,One of their best.,"Waiting for all of their past LP's to come out on CD, Artful Dodger was one of the classics."
4,Ahead of their time...,"This is a solid sophomore release. The bass and the vocals seem a bit muffled, but the overall quality of the songs remain. If not for the disco era this group could have been a contender. Some of the songs are ahead of their time. The stronger tracks are 1,2,3,6,7, & 10. I recommend this album to anyone interested in listening to music by artist that are still hungry and not complacent or overrated."
1,Increased confusion,If ever there was a way to make Calculus more complicated...this book has found it. The pages are predominantly crowded and distracting. Explanations and examples are very difficult to follow. Outlines of solutions are so brief as to be virtually useless. It seems as if he couldn't make up his mind about whether or not to make this a textbook or a study guide. I pity those who have no choice but to use this text.
2,Very disappointed,"I have osteoporosis and have been using OsteoPeak for over 2 years. My recent bone density showed a worsening in my numbers after 2-1/2 years, from -2.5 to -2.7 for the hip and from -2.0 to -2.3 for the lumbar spine. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Perhaps it would be worse if I wasn't taking OsteoPeak, but I thought this product was supposed to increase bone density, not just slow down the loss. Because I'm not sure what effect it has had, I can only give it 2 stars. My doctor wants me to take Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva, or Miaclacin, but I said no. I am now taking 1000mg a day of the mineral strontium which is proven to increase bone density. But don't take it with calcium, because the strontium won't be absorbed if you do."
3,Old-time favorites. Missing most drinks I am familair with.,"I had a friend who is a bartender recommend this book to me as a great book for learning how to mix drinks for home use. It is a good book overall, but a little dated for my tastes. If you want to learn how to mix most of the popular drinks you probably order in a bar today, go with a newer version."
3,not the PERFECT furniture,"Although my wife and I are pleased how our baby room looks overall, If you look at the details of the furniture it seems alittle cheap looking. drawers look smaller than the openings, we have to adjust them so they dont look off, for the price we paid weexpected a bit more quality to the product."
4,"Tosh's last great duet, ""Nothing but Love.""","I've left this album on repeat many a time. Every track is great. Tosh serves as a sentinel, warning us on two tracks to stay independant of friends who seem impartial but rat behind your back. The song that gave this album four stars is ""Cold Blood."" Tosh's vocals sound to countryish for reggae."
4,A Well Rounded Album,This is generally a great album especially with the lost UK edition tracks added into the mix. This album emphasises how much Tosh suffered spiritualy and physically. The pain of the lyrics brings on a great feel for the whole album. I recomend it to any reggae fan.
1,Not essential Peter Tosh.,"This album from Peter Tosh was very disappointing to me. After hearing ""Complete Captured Live"" and ""Legalize It,"" I expected a lot. It didn't live up to my expectations. The songs are all repititious, long, and dare I say...boring. ""Coming In Hot"" and ""Cold Blood"" are the best songs, but there's a better version of ""Coming In Hot"" on ""Complete Captured Live."" So this is really not essential to any reggae fan's collection. If you're an absolutely die-hard Peter Tosh fan, you may want this. If not, you're better of getting these albums first: ""Legalize It,"" ""Equal Rights,"" ""Bush Doctor,"" or ""Complete Captured Live."" Don't waste your time or money on this unless you absolutely can't live without everything Peter Tosh recorded."
5,Most useful book for all levels of writers and editors...,"This cogent little volume lays out the essentials of writing good prose. It not only covers the necessary mechanics, but also covers information on research, revision, and document design. Every editor needs this book, and should purchase new editions as they are released.The genius behind this book is in the organization, including the indexing. Many books are full of all-too-hidden gems. This book is full of information that is easily found, easily used, and easily understood. The tutorials on how to use the book are quite helpful, and should not be ignored by experienced writers. The billable hours you will save in the future are well worth the small investment of your time.I work as an adult-education instructor, and freelance technical writer/editor. This book has helped me help other people. Without this book, it would have been much harder to do the same work."
3,I've heard it's a great book,This book was referred to me by an associate at work. I haven't had the chance to read it and unfortunately my English class has ended!
2,"sorry, i don't agree","i pulled the book off the ""new purchases"" shelf of my local library hoping for some good stuff. cover was inticing. but a story about the life and loves of a penis clouded over the impressions of alaska during gold rush days, kite-building and weather reporting included. women depicted as voiceless hunks of meat do not make for a good read."
4,"Wanted more about THE relationship, less about his work.","Passionate and beautifully written, but when the book veered from the relationship between the protagonist Bigelow and the Aleut woman it was not quite as compelling for me. I found all the characters fascinating - how could you not with Harrison's rich earthy descriptive storytelling, but I couldn't sustain interest in his work - and that takes up a good deal of the book."
2,so very sad,The writer is obviously talented but the structure and tone make for a miserable read. I read this book for a college class. It is one of those books that make you think the author is so deep that you are lucky if you comprehend the storyline much less the symbolism. I would not recommend it. If you must read it get a group and read it aloud together. For the venue cool-aid and cheese crackers go well with this book because anything heavy will cause you to get lethargic and try to wing it during discusssion.
5,Comprehensible concepts from an expert in the field,"We all know of stories where businesses, families and communities went down the drain because the involved parties were locked into years of conflict. In this book, Stewart Levine provides an insightful framework and applications for resolutions that can be put to practice immediately; sort of a 15-Minute Gourmet Resolutions recipe book.A must read for anyone trying to get the most out of relationships."
5,Very Clever!!,"This anthology by a group of Oklahoma mystery writers cleverly uses animals to help solve the various crimes. For example, Moira K. Wiley's story, ""Old Mack Donald's Ghost"", features an emu. One cautionary note--husbands and boyfriends don't fare too well in some of these tales so all of you men be sure to check your egos at the door!!"
3,Good Book but kind of Pricey,"This book was a pretty good book in terms of ideas for taking pet photos and advice for how to take certain types of photos, what type of camera gear you want for certain photography needs, etc. However, the book looks ALOT thicker than it actually is online. I was disappointed with the thickness of the book when I received it in the mail. It is no thicker than a folder with a small stack of papers in it. The text is also pretty large, so I felt like I had paid more than I should have for the book.Overall, its a pretty good book, but a bit expensive."
3,Bought by mistake,"I bought this perfume by mistake, I was actually trying to buy Essencia de Duende, which is a favorite perfume of mine -- Essencia has a very light scent, with a lemon-y undertone. This perfume, ""Duende"" is a little heavier, not a lot, but it's a noticeably bolder scent than Essencia de Duende and is not such a 'natural' scent as Essencia. Duende seems to have a more 'processed' flavor, it's not as subtle as Essencia. I don't absolutely dislike it, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Not So Great,"I accidentally purchased this instead of Esencia de Duende. It has a more straw-like smell to it, and it is stronger than Esencia After it settles on you a while, it is not too terrible and you can smell the base fragrance that makes up the Esencia version. If you like a more ""perfumey"" floral scent, then maybe you would like this one. It is a little heavier than I would recommend if you are used to light scents. Esencia has a really nice ""fresh soap"" fragrance and is much cleaner smelling. My Amazon purchase was fine, it was packaged well and sent in a timely fashion. However, I will probably not order this particular cologne again."
1,Perfume Imposter,"I ordered perfume from this seller, and it was not the real perfume inside the bottle. The lid does not even fit the bottle properly. The bottle has been refilled with a perfume that is not even the same color as the real perfume. The contents smell like a cheap old lady, rather than the sweet smell that I paid for. Do not buy from this seller."
3,Sony Ericsson Akono Bluetooth Headset Review,"When it works I rate this headseat a five but it doesn't work about 40% of the time. When it gets too cold, it disconnects by itself. Currently when I connect it to my cell phone the icon shows connected but it isn't. My friend has the same one and she has no problems with it which makes me suspect that I just got a defective unit."
4,Light and comfortable,"For me it is pretty close to what I was looking for, light, easy to use, because I bought it for my wife, who is not that much for the gadgets, but she likes it, so I'm happy for that too!!!"
2,Bluetooth,"I bought this particular bluetooth because mine was stolen. I had the expectation that this one would be the same as the prior. In short, It wasnt. The quality isn't the same. Hard to hear. At first, it wouldn't connect, I used the mannual from the first purchase. Initially, I payed eighty dollars and this one...well, you get what you pay for. I was really hoping that this one would be the replacement, I was wrong. It still serves as a bluetooth but not the level I wanted."
1,Don't be fooled....it doesn't work with Skype,"I bought this headset from the SonyStyle website because it was advertised as the first ""Skype Compatible"" Sony headset. Despite this, it won't sync with my bluetooth enabled Sony Vaio. Sony Ericsson's tech support couldn't help, claiming that Sony Ericsson is a different company from Sony, and doesn't guarantee compatibility between their products. I went to a physical SonyStyle store, who couldn't get it to work. Sony tech support was equally unable to get it to connect. SonyStyle originally refused to take it back because I've had it for more than 30 days. Finally, they have called me back and accepted a return. While SonyStyle has eventually made things right, it's been a frustrating experience, and I'd recommend buying from Amazon, who have a friendlier return policy!"
2,um it barley works,you really have to shout into the thing for other people to hear you..... i guess its typical of all bluetooth headsets
1,I regret I bought this.,I just bought this for my Samsung A900 cell. It works for a months (It will work well only for 2 to 3 feet's if you go beyond that it won't give you a clear voice) or so after that I can't able to connect with my cell. I try to follow the manual and try to reset again and I am not able to connect.I am not at all happy with this blue tooth. Even I regret I bought this. Just I want to give a heads up to people who want to buy this blue tooth.
5,"Sturdy, reliable, comfortable!","I had one for ages but got mugged and now it's gone. :-( I'm buying a replacement one. Wouldn't think of buying anything else.Worked great with my Sony Ericsson 525a phone. Great sound, and no complaints from people on the other end of the call. Got continually crushed in my purse and doused with hair dye and kept working great. Easy button to pick up a call. So comfortable, I was continually forgetting I had it on."
3,Learning impaired ;-),"I knew nothing about Bluetooths when I decided I needed one for my very small phone. This was round two, first choice would not interface. Received this one without instructions and could not get it to work; called Sony and was told that this model is no longer in production and that the battery may be dead - good luck, it can't be replaced. After much fussing, I called the 3rd party provider. They were kind enough to walk me through set up and pairing and I was up and running in a flash. The ear piece is moderately comfortable, reception tends to breakup unless I keep the phone with me. I use it only when necessary; for the price, it gets the job done."
3,Filter through the negatives to get to positives,"This book contains many grammatical errors and typos. It also contains many contradictions in the instructions for readers. It lacks an organized outline as to how care for Black hair. That's the BAD part. However, after straining through all of the confusion, (although this books attemps to provide hair care for a wider audience..it is really ONLY for those with relaxed hair) I think this book provides a better understanding of chemically relaxed hair and how it grows. The author makes valid points on how to improve your current hair condition. However, as stated before, this book is very unorganized. The author adresses a lot of IMPORTANT information. The contents of this book DEFINITELY needs more organization to aid in clarification of her research and to provide a more convincing argument for her claims."
2,An un-inspired presentation. There are better books...,"I recommend the books ""No Lye"" by Kinard and ""Let's Talk Hair"" by Ferrell if you are looking for real information on how to care for naturally curly/coily hair. This book was poorly laid out, and basically directed toward those who still want to use chemical relaxers. No illustrations or photos!"
3,Needs more proof,"The author did spout a lot of facts but no proof to back them up. It would have really helped if the author could have recommended some shampoos with the appropriate PH balances as well as protein treatments since this was stressed. There were some contradictions on whether your hair was ""dead"" or ""alive"" and whether or not you should use your curling irons/blow dryer. As for chemical relaxers, it is pertinent that anyone that does have chemical relaxer goes 8 wks max!...Going any longer will cause major breakage. 12 to 14 weeks that the author is advising is way too long unless you have hair that is less curly/kinky. But I do appreciate the fact that her hair maintenance program is simple without the need for many hair products."
3,Lost in translation!!!!,"I must say that I am enjoying this book. I am still in the process of reading it. This book does have a lots of good points and suggestions. However, there are so many typos that it is becoming quite of a barrier to get through the true meaning of what the book is trying to tell me.Things like ""do we really need crease"" and ""black hair should be moisturized every clay"". And the list goes on its very quite distracting. I'm sorry but whoever her editor is needs to be fired. I do appreciate her no-nonsense common sense approach to the matter of black hair care. And I can truly say that I have learned a great deal more a about hair care. I'm sorry to say but if she put as much effort in to making sure that her book was published properly and she does in taking care of her hair then this would've been an all-around excellent read."
2,"Save your money, read the website","So, see my review on ultra black hair growth 2000. I thought this was the original book that contained the author's homemade recipe for conditioner as mentioned by another reviewer. Well, it's not in this book. I am disappointed this book is so vague and it cost $43 just to have the same information as the other 2000 version. Read the authors website, save your money."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book was absolutely horrible. I am really sorry that I wasted my money purchasing this book because it didn't provide me with any useful information. It was a drab book to read, as well as visually drab with all the black and white photos. The information is outdated and presented in a convoluted manner. Her suggestions on how to care for your hair are for those who really have the time to take out of each day to follow her procedures. If you are a career woman, you will find it difficult."
4,Ultra Black Hair Growth II,"Very informative! I liked this book because it was concise and had a common sense approach. I gained some crucial information from this book and have seen great results from following the program. If only more ""professionals"" followed her advice! I would definitely recommend it to others."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK-,"TERRIBLE BOOK! I am at a loss for words. It is difficult for me to describe how bad this book really is. I can only say that THIS IS THE WORST BLACK HAIR CARE BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. There isn't any proof to support the UNPROFESSIONAL OPIONS of the author. Reading this book will be a waste of your time and money. It was written in 1994 and is out-dated. This book is poorly structured, UNSUBSTANTIATED and desperately NEEDS MORE CURRENT INFORMATION."
5,"Wonderful music,delivered promptly in good condition. thanks.","Wonderful music,delivered promptly in good condition. thanks. We are all going to enjoy this in the nursing home.Thank you so much. It is very uplifting.RustyMindy"
3,Beware! Reviewer above gives five stars to every release in this series,"Beware! Reviewer above gives five stars to every release in this series. Perhaps he is sincere, but also, there is another ""person"" who writes similar reviews of this series that also always gives five stars."
4,Praise well deserved,"I am not a Wesleyan, but I readily confess that Charles Wesley was a great man. This film goes a long way toward instructing the public about the many admirable facets of his life and ministry. His brother John has certainly gotten most of the acclaim of the two, but I am persuaded that Charles' life was much better balanced. The number of his hymns is astonishing.""George Whitefield (I'm not sure why they pronounced it 'White - field"") is a great hero of mine, and I wish even more could have been said about the influence Whitefield had on both of the Wesleys. See Arnold Dallimore's marvelous biography of Whitefield. The fact that Whitefield and the Wesleys could maintain such warm Christian fellowship to the end of their lives, even in the face of significant theological differences, is a fact much to be commended.Apart from a few minor points understandable in light of my differing theological perspective, I would recommend this film to all, evangelicals and otherwise."
2,Should have bought single selections,"I wanted Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, and always enjoyed Air Force and Command Decision, so the package seemed like a bargain. Wrong! None of the selections have scene selection. If you wish to see a selected portion of the movie, you have to run through the entire film. I had seen the other three selections and I wouldn't have bothered to buy them individually. I now have Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, but it is a cut rate DVD and not worth the price I paid."
3,Off We Go....,"Ahhh to hate those from Japan! How easy it was to twist the facts to put the fear of God into the average American! This attempt at propaganda had it all...the proud father, the tough kid, the boy next door, and even the cute dog! Too bad it was over the top. Still...it is a popcorn movie that could be used to open talk on fear and racism in the 1940's as well as what people will do to win you over to their cause. I enjoy watching it and would recommend it for a collector. Most others would be put off by the heavy hand of hollywood!"
2,Sub-standard WWII Collection,"Of the 6 films, 3 are old films made in the '40 (Air Force; Command Decision; 30 Seconds Over Tokyo) and widely available in dvds for sometime.Hell to Eternity is an obscure war film. 36 Hours is more fitting for espionage catagory. The Hill, which is probably the most powerful film among the 6, is a prison film.A carefully selected Sidney Lumet Collection is highly anticipated."
4,Good movie.,"An interesting movie I enjoyed the thought of the lone bomber arriving in Hawaii at the the time it did,a good movie."
4,Great WWII Film,"Lots of action, suspense, thrill, bombs and camaraderie. Well packed war movie with fast pace action, good dialogue, growing in intensity as the story develops and amazingly well done settings that give plenty of realism. The dark scenarios along the film provide that gloomy and tragic feeling that matches those moments before and after Pearl Harbor. The cast does pretty well and their friendship on the B-17 is not just an accompaniment to the war scenes but grows with them.It sure reveals the masterful hand of classic artisan director Howard Hawks. If not one of his greatest films it still is a very good one, and one of the very best war films ever."
4,Air Force,"This is one of my favorte early World War II movies. It is far from historically correct (I.E. Japanese ground troups are assumed on several Hawaiian Islands), but well acted and full of the stars of the day."
5,This company rocks!,"Excellent product, on time delivery, amazing price, super service. These guys are super especially for a niche market... wish we could get the word out to more people. I'm sure there are many out there in the same boat as I who needed their stuff which isn't readily available. Good on ya 365 garage door parts!"
5,No worries,"Even though it wasn't the same color as the part that broke on my garage door opener, I thought I didn't have anything to lose trying given the price. Turn out perfect! The part is very tuff, I'm thrilled! Fitted like a gear which is tighter then a glove..lolFIVE STAR 4 sure"
1,Boring treatment of fascintaing subject,"Beth Schweiger has taken a fascintating and firey subject--preaching and religion in nineteenth-century Virginia--and turned it into something dry, desicated, dull, both in writing and analysis. Save your time and money."
3,An enjoyable easy book to read,I found the book very enjoyable and very easy to read. Ideal if you don't want anything to heavy - ideal holiday reading. The characters were well defined and I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
4,Science fiction review,Science Fiction Jazz 6 is a well crafted compilation. Plenty of good contributions from a wide variety of artisits. Recommended for those who enjoy new age instrumental jazz.
4,A Must for the Hockey Coach's Toolkit,"This book offers a comprehensive set of introductory materials needed for the first time or experienced hockey coach. It is useful for either ice or roller hockey. I particularly appreciated the author's including the social, communication, and motivational aspects of coaching youth sports. Full of handy checklists and drills to emphasize the needed skills, this book provides a solid foundation for developing ""your own"" hockey teaching and coaching program. The drills and progressions are excellent. The book would be better with more technical emphasis on skating skills and techniques. But overall, I would recommend it for any coach or parent who is close to this fast-growing sport!"
2,Need a Cheap Dance Pad,"This game is so dorktastic that if you are caught playing it, you will loose cool points.That said, like many other dancing games that are not DDR, you need to buy the cheap dance pad controller that has all of the buttons as the handheld controller.There is no instructional phase to the game, you are just expected to know how to play from the start. I would suggest this as maybe a cute game for small children to learn how to hit the controller buttons on a hand-held controller more than I would as an actual dancing game."
2,Go with Nelson playing Riddle arrangements,"It's a fine concept, probably made for a wonderful pops theme concert, & these arrangements would be delightful encores for any orchestra. But it doesn't ""get"" Nelson Riddle. Riddle's sound was also built on the ace Hollywood studio musicians he used - veterans of the big bands. Riddle was known to tailor arrangements to individual players. Then there was the studio craft of the Capitol Record engineers; in the later recordings that sound featured lots of reverb & a fat bass guitar. Riddle went to the studio with an ear to recording hit instrumental singles, & he had a number of them in addition to many releases that didn't chart. Albums were assembled around them. Everything got the Riddle studio treatment, from classics of the Great American Songbook to TV themes & corny novelties. Riddle was a pop artist. So there's no strong reason to have this album when Riddle's Capitol recordings are available in their original LP form & in compilations."
4,"Finger snapping, hum along fun","Kunzel and Cincinnati Pops have made a terrific CD. They have put an new twist on the swing music of Nelson Riddle, using instrumentals in place of the vocals. I have listened to this one over and over. This is a fun CD."
3,"Good, but I prefer Nelson Riddle's recordings of his music.","This recording is good, and if you have not heard Nelson Riddle's recordings you will probably love it. But I prefer the feeling of the recordings Nelson Riddle made. Those recordings are fantastic! And the quality of the sound on his recordings is excellent, so I see no reason for them to be redone. Still, I'm glad to see his music getting this attention."
3,I think Nelson would be proud of this cd,"When I read of this project, I was very excited about buying this cd and listening to an updated version of the Nelson Riddle sound. I must say that I have not been disappointed. I feel like who ever did the re-arranging did a good job of remaing as close as possible to Nelsons' sound.I feel like Nelson, where ever he might be, is looking down with a giant smile on his face and saying BRAVO, you did a good job in paying a tribute to me and my music. THANKS A MILLION!Recommendation: Any fan of Nelsons' will have to have this cd, so go on and buy it."
1,How to murder the Riddle SOund,"This is probably the worst example of an orchestral re-work of a popular arranger. In fact, it's probably the worst CD I have ever bought. Clearly no one on the arrangement staff, nor Kunzel, have ever heard or understood Nelson Riddle's charts, licks or vibe. It's an embarrasement to Telarc and they should pull it from their catalogue. Sorry guys, but this is really awfull!"
4,a slightly flawed but still very lovely book,"a pity this is out of print Its an eccentric story about the english aristocracy and esp that of a young duke growing up. VSW, the daughter of an earl and wife herself, knows the problems and glories of English aristocracy from the inside. A charming book to take to the beach or read by the way, if you can find it at a used book store or in a sufficiently old library. Full of good humor."
2,Don't Like,I didn't like the way the book was written and I did NOT like Doris Duke!. What a waste of a human being.
5,shawn's review,I didn't care much for Junior but I love the other movies Twins & Kindergarten Cop. these are A really good watch & if you haven't seen them you have missed out.
1,One movie missing,"We were supposed to receive a trilogy of Schwarzenegger movies, however, we only received Twins and Junior. The return date had already passed before we tried to watch Kindergarten Cop and found out it was missing and not on the backside of one of the disks as indicated. Very disappointed. I now see others have has similar problems."
2,Horrible Sound Quality,"Great recording, horrible sound quality. The cymbals especially sound terrible. Don't waste your money on this. Hopefully another record company chooses to use the original master and does the service to this recording that it deserves."
4,Cookbook Has Air of Nostalgia,"I truly enjoyed To Every Season: A Family Holiday Cookbook. The book encompasses recipes for 16 major American holidays, including Christmas, Mother's Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving. I found the prefaces to each holiday section fascinating and filled with delightful historical tidbits. The book has wonderful multicultural leanings with its inclusion of recipes for Passover, Kwanzaa, and Chanukah. I would have liked to have seen more recipes that could be made by or with children. The book caters more to adult tastes and preferences than to those of children. Children will enjoy the pictures and reading about the different holiday traditions."
4,Wonderful!,"I love discover other cultures and traditions as well as cooking and baking. This book brings together the best of both worlds. It feels a little dated, and there are no photos (just illustrations) but somehow between the format, colours and stories/descriptions it all comes together perfectly."
3,Doris fan,"I was surprised by this DVD - it was not the film I was expecting, however it was lovely to watch. I'll be getting more of her films."
2,A family of six move to the country.,"Doris Day is the mother of four rambunctous children (Charles Herbert, Stanley Livingston and Flip Mark). Her husband (David Niven) is a playwriter who has been hired by a newspaper as a play critic. Not everyone likes him now, but now that he is getting publicity he prefers to stay in the city. Doris Day's dream is to buy a house in the country. That is what they have been planning. They finally buy a big house in the country, but adjusting to country life is different for everyone. Kathryn Card (""I Love Lucy"") has a small role. Doris sings ""Que Sara Sara"" which she first sang in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1956). The song was later used in the tv series The Doris Day Show.Please Don't Eat The Daisies became a tv series (1965-67) starring Pat Crowley and Mark Miller with Kim Tyler, Brian Nash, Jason Fithian and Jeff Fithian. Ellen Corby played the maid."
3,Not one of the better Doris Day movies,It didn't keep my attention. I had to keep stopping and starting it because I couldn't get into it. I wish they had some Doris Day and Brian Keith movies such as With Six You Get Eggroll.
2,where was the movie?,i saw some kid a couple times and that was about it. hardly even saw doris day and when i did it was rather droll. loved the tv show and love doris day but ... i definitely don't love this movie.
4,My how times have changed!!,"This was a fun and intersting movie, the way times have changed and how women are depicted brought more humour to this old time family movie"
5,A great romantic comedy!,"I really liked this film, it has an intereting story and good humor. Doris Day and David Nivan are cast well together a husband and wie in this film, with children. It's colorful and really interesting."
5,great,"great actorsand a story that stayes valid as long as mankind existand, most important, compatible with my video system"
5,A Great Getaway,"This reviewer always discounted Doris Day as a Gidget like character, but in this role she is charming. Her acting reminds me somehow of Cary Grant, with all the physical quirks and she comes off as not a daisy dreamer but a real person. Niven is of course charming. Roles are not as uptight as expected. And the story somehow is quite modern: How success can sometimes come between a couple. Ask anyone who has had a successful spouse. There is always a price. But in this movie, the ending is perfect. And I loved the kid in the cage... but you'll have to watch it to understand that."
2,Doris & David a No Show,I like both of these actors but disappointed in the the miscasting of David Niven. He hardly shows up as a father which is a major theme in the book.J
1,Awful,"Hideous film. The whole film is about poor Doris Day and her ""challenges"". What challenges? This film was not at all funny or engaging. Rent/buy it only if you're a Doris Day or (yawn!) David Niven fan. Fans of the great comic actress Patsy Kelly beware - she only has a small part and that role is wasted. What a shame, perhaps had Patsy Kelly been better utilized, this would have been a funny movie."
1,so what's a 5 piece place setting worth?,"Just a simple question, right? Wrong! I paid a lot of moneyhoping to find an answer to my question. This book is for a collectorwho already knows what the flow blue pieces are worth. If you're a beginning collector, save your money!"
3,rating on hummer cd player,it is a cool looking cd player but the bad thing is you get like maby 7 hour battery life and just mayby on a good day you will get 2 radio stations on fm. but it has 2 head jacks for multiple listening and its got internal speakers that are ok at least they dont sound like computer internal speaker which suck!! its not the best you can get for the price but its better than a cheap 30 dollar cd player
4,NUGGETS OF WISDOM PLUS GOOD ADVICE,"Throughout history people have been challenged to be the best that they can be. All around us are those who urge others to live up to their potential. Well, potential probably varies from person to person but no doubt each of us can use improvement.All of us wish to be successful, whether it be in our personal or professional lives. With ""The Seven Secrets"" Pastor John Hagee refers to what he calls ""godly principles"" to help others achieve their goals and solve difficult problems.Eloquently read by J. Charles the disc subtitled ""Uncovering Genuine Greatness"" discusses differences between false and real success. The author's motivational message includes attitude - focusing on perseverance, self-esteem, self-mastery, communication, prosperity, and prayer.There are nuggets of wisdom and good advice for all in ""The Seven Sisters."""
5,One of my all time favorite books!,"This novel traces a small group of young women living in Ohio from the time of their graduation and up through their late periods in life. You learn their innermost thoughts, their secrets and fears, and you see how they maintain their friendships and families throughout their lives - through all sorts of ups and downs. The characters are so memorable that you will miss them when they are gone. Do not let the length of this book keep you from reading this treasure!"
5,Cast of Characters,"I've just finished my second read of this outstanding book; the first time was when it first came out in the 80's. As always when I re-read something many years later, I find my reactions to be quite different.. I've lived more, experienced more, read more. My attention is drawn to sections which didn't interest me the first time around. But ONE thing remains unchanged about this book: I need a Cast of Characters and/or geneology charts! I intended to create such fifteen years ago but didn't. Has anyone out there done that???? Especially during the last third of the book, when the time line moved faster, I found myself confused about the relationships of families, marriages, offspring. If I get it done, I will so note in this space; if someone else has done it, please let us know. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would find it useful."
4,Helen 'Hoof' Santmyer,"""...And Ladies of the Club"" is a warm story. It follows a group of women who struggle to comprehend their place in a complicated world, finding solidarity amongst each other in a fellowship for women with club feet, the name of which gives this novel its title. One particular highlight is page 168 where the author describes the relapse of a club foot back to its starting position, calling it ""a time-lapsed lilac closing in on itself as the sun sets, creaking."" Beautiful."
3,"Slow, cumbersome read","I was shocked to see that most people gave this book a high rating. I found it to be really slow to develop and a wordy,cumbersome read. I would NOT recommend this book. It took her fifty years to write it, it will take me at least that long to read it."
2,Tried twice,"Tried twice to get into this book and then gave up. It only got worse! Since there are so many good books to read out there, I would not suggest you waste your time trying to get into this one."
1,Not woth the time investment,"I spent a summer reading this incredibly long book and by the end, I was sorry I had wasted my time on it. The characters and plot were uninteresting and flat and the story never picks up the pace you expect it to. It just meanders slowly through the lives of the townsfolk, with hundreds of pages of unimportant detail in between each occasion of interest. Although many reviewers have called it inspirational, it didn't find it to be so. Certainly many things happened in these women's lives, but their emotions and the impact of the occurances was rarely discussed more than matter of factly.I would not recommend this book. If you're looking for something inspiring about women's lives and relationships, try something by Alice Walker or Toni Morrison."
2,"Should be a ""Lifetime"" made-for-TV movie","Very unchallenging and lightly pleasant. Not deep and eventually rather repetitive in its choice of topics - love, politics, births/deaths, parties. Buy it used!"
3,Ms. Santmyer was amazing,If you like books with lots of detail and the book goes on and on and on...you will enjoy this book. Ms. Santmyer poured her heart and soul into this book... it is all there in each character. I could not finish it for the Book Club and had to get the Guidelines Notes to be able to talk about it. I did enjoy the history aspect of the book...it so related to current politics.
3,I Kept Waiting...,"I kept waiting for this story to pick up. The first third of the book is painfully boring. The author goes on and on ""descriptively"" saying nothing. It does pick up considerably as the book gets into the later sections, but by then it's almost too late. There is no rhyme nor reason as to why the husband demonstrates such violence, and the passages about the snakes, while educational, don't really have much bite (pun intended). While definitely not the worst book I have ever read, I was glad to finish this book so I could move on to something more interesting. My mom read ""Season of the Snake"" before giving it to me and she felt the same way. Two sideways thumbs from both of us."
3,The author was finally caught,This book is about a trip Moyer and his book took to the Dakotas.It includes photos (some of them with Moyer nude ) and camping experiences.The author of this book was recently on the show 'american's most wanted'. He had fled to mexico. He was teaching in a university and suggested to his students to look up on the internet about his book. What they found was more than he expected. They found out that he was a fugitive and they turned him in. Now he sits in jail.I wonder if he will write a book about this experience.
4,"Autobiography, easy to read","You can read this book in a weekend and it's very interesting.It's his autobiography, his inventions.It's available free on the internet in pdf.You should buy ""A man out of Time"" instead."
4,Short book gives insight into Tesla's thinking,"Tesla explains he had extremely sensitive senses. He claimed he could hear a watch ticking three rooms away (with the doors closed). His visual sense was so strong that he would test inventions in his head. Only after all the errors were fixed using his imaginary invention model, would Tesla physically construct the device. This method of working saved him a lot of money and time.It's insights like these, which make this book fascinating. Biographers can spin a narrative for you - what Tesla did and when. But only Tesla can tell you what it was like to be Tesla.As another reviewer noted - this book can be read for free, online - if you search around enough. It's worth it."
2,More Tecnnology Than Autobiography,"This is not a bad book if you're interested in Tesla, although he includes far more information on his inventions, as the title suggests, than he does biographical information. The style is rather dry, but the technical ideas are informative for anyone interested in the history of technology in the 19th and 20th centuries."
4,Eight bucks well spent!,"As an avid Tesla coil builder, I found this book to be another great resource to add to my collection. Thanks Ben Johnston."
2,Why i am the greatest inventor of the world.,Why im the greatest inventor of the world would have been a more appropiate title to this book. A narcicistict travel as to how he saw himself against a world of idiots. This man who i revere as a scientist was completely nuts and his autobiography lets you peak into his thought process. After reading this book you can see how driven he was and also why he had so many bad business dealings with people. This book is helpful to understand him as a man but thin on his scientific work. After reading other books on him and his notes im glad to read his own words about himself. It explains alot.
1,Not worth the shipping,"Not what I expected. His childhood years were interesting. But I didn't finish it - and I really like books about inventors. Not enough info. His writing style is a bit hard to follow. Better to buy a bio written by somebody else. I rate it ""One Induction Motor""."
2,Tesla better at inventing than writing,"Mr. Tesla should have let someone else write his biography. Granted he was at his peak in the early 1900's, but much of the information he gives out about his life, especially his childhood years, is truly unbelievable - not in a good way."
3,Nothing new here.,"The book is a compiliation of famous quotes, some short stories about influential people and Mr. Maxwell's contributons, where he uses catchy acronyms to imply some kind of motivational message to the reader.This has all been done to death, and there is nothing memorable or noteworthy that you haven't either heard somewhere else or read before. The book is surrounded by colorful pictures and splashy graphics, but as far as literary content is concerned it is positively average, at best."
2,Disappointing,"Teamwork Makes the Dream Work contains some great stories and a ton of pithy quotes, but they come across as rather disconnected and anecdotal. It's higher on inspiration than on information. I'm a Maxwell fan, and typically enjoy his style and insights.It's not that the material is bad, but the book's description and some of the other reviews here led me to expect a lot more meat on the hard work involved in choosing, building, developing, empowering, and leading a team to do something significant. After reading the book I found it gave very little concrete information on any of this - spending far more time pitching the need for teams. Even scanning through it quickly a second time I had a hard time coming up with a concrete takeaway idea to put into practice.If you can get it here at a bargain price (as I was able to) it's not a bad read, but just don't expect too much."
1,Extremely Cheap price... but horrible formatting,"A little while ago, I bought the E-book version of this for my kindle for something like $2.99. I'm sure the Maxwell content in it is good, but the formating makes it terribly difficult to read. All of the text is centered with a bunch of extra spaces between lines.I've tried to see if its a problem with my kindle, but every other ebook I have on it displays correctly. Don't buy the kindle version of this book."
4,Nice smelling,"Nice smell, it reminds me of Joop! but a little sweeter. I got this for work so I don't need to use expensive cologne, it lasts about 4 hours so you may need to respray, but for $10 not bad."
2,"Arrive fast, nice bottle and package, but smells horrible","The title pretty much says it all. Don;t know any other way to describe this then to say it seems as though it was designed to cause a headache. The scent is beyond horrible. The only saving grace is that it wears off quickly. Gave it two stars for fast shipping and good packing, but the cologne itself..."
1,Too Sweet,"This is Too sweet smelling. Better suited as womens perfume than cologne. It gave me a headache.Sorry, Can't reccomend it."
2,To sweet and feminine,Giving my bottle away tomorrow. I tried to like this stuff but it is to sweet smelling. Also there is an odor in it that flat out just makes me ill. It smells good on someone else but I cant wear this stuff. Very cloying. If you(a Man) like to smell like sweet vanilla this stuff is for you.Buy the cuba red(I have) ALOT more manly smelling...spicy good sent.
5,"Smells good, after the initial scent",At first this is a little to strong for my liking but if you throw it on twenty minutes before you go out or get dressed you'll love the scent. It really is a distinct scent in my opinion and isn't overwhelming as time passes. The scent also lasts all day long. Great product that I plan to purchase in the future.
5,"Quality filter, used on Kohler Command V-Twin","Never had a problem with these filters. They are made in the USA and have a full metal construction with a silicone anti drain back valve.We use these on our Kohler Command V-Twin engines that call for the ""Kohler 1205001"" to give us a little more oil & filtration capacity (and a quality filter at a lower price). Although the Wix 51516 is a taller version (4.8"" tall) it fits in our applications but may not in some applications. The standard length (2.7"" tall) Wix replacement is a Wix 51056.These substitutes will also work on other small engines with a 3/4-16 thread size including some Briggs and Stratton engines. To verify the substitution Wix has a filter look-up on there website that will accept small engine manufacturers part numbers.FYI: Amazon's price changes between 4 and 8. Once saved in your cart Amazon will show you the price change since the last time you checked your cart."
1,I would NOT recomend this camera....,"I have had this camera for about a year and a half and am very disappointed with it. For the first 6 mos or so, It worked like a dream, and it took great pictures. I was elated! About the 7th month in or so, it just fell apart on me. My dream camera turned into a nightmare.I will 2nd what many others have already said. THIS CAMERA CANNOT FOCUS, ESPECIALLY INDOORS, THUS PICTURES ARE BLURRY AND UNCLEAR MOST OF THE TIMES!!! Even when the subject is sitting as still as a statue and I am holding the camera still, the pictures look as if I had been swinging it back and forth as I took the picture.Also the delayed reaction is terrible! It seems to take more time to capture a picture than most other cameras, I have compared it to. ( I tested out cameras of my family and friends.)For this reason, you usually miss the moment you were attempting to capture.Consider yourself warned before purchasing this camera. It is a financial risk."
2,Focusing problems,"Overall, this is a decent camera, but its problems focusing are an issue and so I would NOT recommend buying this camera. Before I start, let me state that I have read the directions and gone through all the settings in the camera. I've done my best to rule out the human error.The picture quality and colors look good, when they are in focus. However, any time that the light, inside or outside, is a bit tricky the camera cannot focus. As an example, I took 5 pictures of a lit christmas tree and all came out blurry. I took another 5 pictures using a Canon Powershot S500 and all of them were perfectly clear. I'll admit that this is a tricky item to focus on, but the Sony DCS-P73 has trouble focusing whenever there is glare. It has ruined a number of shots... easy shots.So, if you are buying a camera for point and shoot... this one isn't it. This camera is a - (cross your fingers for a clear picture) - and shoot camera.I hope this helps."
1,Go with a Kodak....,"I had a Kodak camera for years that I absolutely loved. We took it ice skating and ended up falling on it. Therefore, my family bought me this Sony for my b-day and I have to say this is the worst camera I have ever owned. If you have any movement (such as action shots or small children) the picture always comes out blurry. What a pain! Also, the picture quality is horrible. I will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a Kodak."
2,Unsatisfactory pictures,"I bought this camera after reading several positive reviews. I found that this camera has good features, is easy to use and has a battery charger. But to my dismay the picture quality was below par and didn't meet my expectations. The picture brightness with this camera is lower than a Nikon I had bought 18months ago. Most of the pictures appeared dim and a little dull wheras Nikon pictures at the same spot were brighter. I'm returning this camera. I will probably spend some extra dollars to buy a canon or a Nikon"
2,I regret I bought this.,"For quite sometime lured by media publicity I thought Sony a good brand. But this was not at all true for digital cameras. I bought this P73 for myself and an HP 4 MP camera for my cousin much cheaper than Sony. Both 3x Optical zoom. The HP one was far better in image quality. Main problem is that photo quality is not so good. It lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy. This fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a Cannon or an HP camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. Also, in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom, say 5x or so in other brands. Also during video, every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off, another irritating fact.Not recommended."
4,Gift Camera,"I received this camera about 4 years ago as a gift. It is my first digital camera. My only complaint is that 'action shots' are usually blurry. The best shots are stills where I take my time and frame them properly. Shots on the go don't come out that well. The quality of the still pictures is very good. It is also very easy to set up the timer and has one-button last-picture recall.It is very portable and fits easily in my jeans pocket or purse.If I upgraded, I would get a further-reaching zoom and one that freezes the action better. I would still look at Sony first."
2,Blurry inside shots,We've had this camera for almost a year now and it takes fantastic shots in the daylight but nearly 50% of all inside shots are out of focus. I have read the manual and tried numerous settings with no change.
4,Good beginner camera,"I received this camera as a gift a few years ago and I ended up falling in love with photography because of it. It's great for beginners because it's not that expensive... obviously what the camera lacks in megapixels and zoom are what you save in dollars. But I have taken hundreds of gorgeous photos. It's extremely user-friendly, unlike HPs I've used, and action shots have never been a problem. Just note that you can't zoom in while shooting movies (MPEG) but it does pick up sound cleanly. I also found it to be very durable... it's been dropped countless times, used outside during the (Wisconsin) winter, and exposed to both water and sand but the picture quality hasn't decreased. (Make sure you get a case for it- it doesn't come with one but they're cheap.) I'm now looking into freelance photography as a career, but until I save up enough for one of those fancy $ 700 deals, this one will definitely get me through."
4,Sony DSCP73,The Sony DSCP73 Camera does NOT come with a Carl Zeiss Vario Tessar Lens. It is a 4.1 Mega-Pixel Camera...NOT a 3.2 megapixel Camera. Please get your facts right. The Camera itself is amazing...great picture quality and simple to use.
2,Better off with something else,"I bought this camera last year. I returned it the next day and bought a Canon instead. The [sony] camera was *okay* but if you're picky about your photos like I am, don't get this camera. The quality isn't that great, neither is the flash. A semi-lit area would come out blurry and brown-tinted, if that makes any sense. But I can take a picture with my canon in a pitch black room and the photo comes out great.Bottom line, you can get a much better camera for the same price, or even less."
4,Ooooops!,"Well the camera is cool for such a price, real bargain ;) But i do have one question and i was not able to find the answer in the instructions book. Well, after taking a picture when i want to enlarge my picture with the Playback Zoom, i'm able to zoom it but i can't save the zoom! Why? I don't know what's wrong, the book doesnt say anything about it and the menu button doesnt' work when i try to zoom the picture. I'll apreciate if somebody can give a piece of advice. please drop me a line at letoile_me@yahoo.com"
4,"Overall, a great camera","As about two or more reviewers got this for the holidays, and so did I. I have to say, this camera is great. I'll just break down pros + cons because it's an electronic devicePROS:- With the 4.1 megapixels, picture and video quality is clear and crisp.- Easy menus.- Overall easy to use if a beginner.- Many different ways and styles to take pictures.- Very durable, as Sony products are mostly all trustful.- Love the zoom in and zoom out features.- Easy to delete videos and pics.- Easy to connect to a computer or a television.CONS:- The memory stick that came with this is only 16MB which is only 8 pictures and 42 secs for video. Luckily, I also got a 256MB memory stick seperatly and I can take about 120 pics and 11 min for video.- The batteries were not charged up when I recived the product.- Sound on the videos are sometimes weak.Overall, this camera is great, but make sure to buy a seperate memory stick or you will only have 42 seconds of fun with the video and only 8 pics."
5,A cat tale,My 9 year old really wanted this book. It was a good book obviously based on Romeo & juliet. It was way below her reading level but she enjoyed it so much and is one of those books she likes to reread. I am glad we got it and would recommend it to others. Nice intro to Shakespeare.
4,Pretty good stuff,"On buying this cd I put the second cd on straight away and was blown away from it! Especially by Trash..it is pretty explosive! I think the melodies to the treck ""untitled"" are really good and its a good tune to chill out to. I think that the Ana's song remix sounds better than it does on Neon Ballroom. I really like Punk song 2 although I wouldn't classify it as a punk song it really does hit a high note for me! The first cd is okay...I like the dynamics used on Anthem for the Year 2000 that were not used in Neon Ballroom. ... I wouldn't have bought this as Sony released it when they were coming to the end of their contract with Silverchair..Silverchair did not actually give them permission to do it. But still, the cover songs are great."
4,Book Luster!,"Nancy Pearl is the ultimate librarian and book-nut. This book follows in the same vein as her original Book Lust, but with different lists. Pearl provides an annotated list to each book she has enjoyed in categories such as: Best for Teens, Fantasy for Young and Old, Graphica, Libraries and Librarians, and many more. It was a quick read and I kept pen and paper handy to make my own TBR list from Pearl's findings."
4,What to read next?,"If you are like me, you love a good book, but they are hard to find. I don't know a lot about most of the authors to know if their works would interest me. This is a must have for any book lover. Every possible catagory of literature is broken down in these books (Book Lust and More Book Lust.)I recommed using a highlighter when reading. You will find tons of new books that you will want to read."
4,more books more lust,"If you liked the original Book Lust, you will also enjoy More Book Lust. The only problem I have with both volumes is the author's inclusion of lists of one author's works. In some cases they were interesting introductions to writers I hadn't heard of, but those authors could have been included in other book lists."
2,This just didn't work for me,"I ended up giving this book away; somehow the reviews by Nancy Pearl just didn't jive for me. Maybe our tastes are too different. She is thorough, though, and I really wanted to like her recommendations. It's probably just a personal thing."
1,Another disappointment,"Even though I didn't like the first Book Lust, I couldn't help giving this one a try too, because I usually love books full of suggestions of other books to read. Unfortunately it is much like this first (as was to be expected): a massive list of books arranged into somewhat random categories. It was impossible to tell from what she said which of the books I would actually enjoy reading. (Amazon lists and reader reviews are much more helpful.) Also, from those of the books she recommended that I had read, her taste is too all-inclusive for me. She seems to love everything, a lot of which I don't think is very good."
2,Disappointing.....,"I was so excited about reading The Book Lust having heard it reviewed on NPR. Bought the last copy at my local book store. HOWEVER, I became quickly disappointed immediately. There is no way to quickly reference countries or cities one might be travelling to or interested in learning about. I was interested in Spain and Portugal, so I went to the Table of Contents and the reference list in the back of the book. There was nothing listed about Spain or Portugal. Ms. Pearl might have written about one or both of the countries but the countries were not listed by name. One would have to read the entire book to find information pertaining to any particular country of interest. I'm sure she has interesting info to share, but the book is not organized in a way that would be user friendly. It's too bad that Ms. Pearl's vast knowledge of books written about particular parts of the world can not be utilized by the interested traveller easily.Dana"
1,beautiful but terrifying,"This crib was wonderful, beautiful, and something my wife and I thought was a great investment. Then one morning we woke to a terrifying scream from our babys room. Running in we found our 7 month old baby standing at the edge with his leg stuck between the slats unable to get it back out. We had to lift him up slightly, twist his body, and then turn his leg in order to get his leg free. This has happened a couple times and is really scary. We have tried bumpers and now drape heavy blankets around the entire crib trying to prevent this from happening. It is a very pretty crib but not with all the blankets draped all over it, because we are trying to keep our baby from breaking his leg he is now 1 yr old and of descent size and still able to get stuck."
1,frustrated customer,"I've made several attempts to locate a crib through the computer and your computer is not people friendly when purchasing. I have spoken to several stores, and no one seems to be able to figure out how to locate a crib other than physically walking in and purchasing it at the store. I need this crib asap and everyone seems to say 10-14 days."
2,Read this first being buying...,I loved the look of this crib and changing table/dresser so we bought it! And it IS beautiful! We have had it in our babies room for 6 months and I am sooo dissapointed! The paint ( cream color that you see) on the changing table has started to flake off and it seems with every day more of the paint is missing. Since the crib doesn't get as much wear and tear ( opening drawers etc.) I would recommend the crib. But if you are thinking of buying any coordinating pieces of this furniture... don't expect it to last too long.
3,This is not a white crib,I saw this crib on the Babies r us web site and fell in love with it. I went to the store to order it and they had one on the floor. I changed my mind when I saw it. On the Web site it looks off white (which I wanted) but in the store it is a honey yellow and was too over powering with the bedding I bought. I was very disappointed. I really wanted this crib.
4,Quality Furniture,"We bought this crib, as well as the dresser/changing table. I still absolutely LOVE this set. The look is fabulous and the pieces are very sturdy. We moved 4 months ago and both the crib and dresser held up wonderfully in the process. I also like that fact that she can use this furniture in the years to come. One thing that does concern me, the crib is not adjustable. My 8 month daughter is pulling herself up and I am worried about saftey issues, again my daughter is very tall for her age so it may not be a problem for everyone. Overall, great addition to a baby girls nursery!"
2,gary nixon racer,good book on motorcycle history. written on a jr highschool level. very ego centric. worth reading but no where near what the used book market ask. paper back copies were available for 25 cents in the 80s. you wont get you monies worth at $100 or more. i know its supply and demand but its a $10 book.
2,Short and one-sided. A disappointment.,"After reading the other reviews I was surprised to find this to be short, and not nearly as detailed or balanced as I had hoped it would be. There are two sides to every battle, and while I wouldn't suggest that anyone could put a positive spin on Bonnie Prince Charlie's actions, THIS little ""documentary"" was clearly written from an English perspective. I have been to Culloden and can say that quite a bit was left out or glossed over. Disappointed."
2,text problem,"Sorry, but I am a little disapointed.Only one part Infelix ego has translated text. It is not easy to understand polyphonic latin!"
4,Everything you wanted to know about the Erie Canal!,"I loved it! And I learned a lot! The filmmaker has a quirky sense of humor, which he uses to effect to tell the history of the Canal. I loved the way he used the songs - especially ""Off Mule"", with drawings by Peter Spier - with a montage of images to create a sense of life on the canal. This is not your usual Discovery Channel format, tho! It's a cinema verite look at the Canal, with people talking across the camera, but always with a point in mind. For example there is a scene where we see city workers dumping garbage in on of the enlarged Erie locks, followed by a shot of a mother and kids collecting cans along the towpath.Tom Grasso, president of the NY Canal Society, really knows his canal history, and his presence adds a note of authority to this delightful film!"
5,Their Most Important Stories Of All!,"The Legion's most pivotal stories laying the groundwork for continuity of the next three decades. With this volume, you get the Fatal Five, Sun Eater, and Adult Legion stories. Great Jim Shooter writing and beautiful Curt Swan artwork, the definitive Legion of Super-Heroes. If you have to get just one volume out of the series, this is the one."
1,WARNING,"This is a NOT a book about building or making terrrariums. It is a work of FICTION. A story set in the future. I bought this book along with others on terrariums becuase I wanted to make a terrarium for my lizards. I wasn't going to since there was a total lack of description of the book, but I saw it was in the list of recommendations and bought it anyway. The book was not at all what I needed. I wonder how many others have been mislead into buying it?"
5,Best ball ever!!,This ball is absolutely amazing. My 5 month old daughter is learning to crawl with this. It is by far her favotite toy. It's so easy to grab that even her tiny fingers can get a hold of it. This will also be great when she starts learning to catch. I love this ball.
5,"3 month old loves it, easy to grasp","My 3 month old loves this toy. He didn't know how to use his opposable thumbs when he got it. He just needed to hook his little finger on it and he could hold it without dropping and bring it to his mouth to chew. Now, he learned to use his thumbs! He gets mad at it sometimes when he can't get it in his mouth, but that is how he learns. It attaches to his swing/stroller/car seat with any brand of links. Easy to wash. Definitely a favorite toy. Other toys with similar features that are easy for early teethers are the GrabApple and the Winkle."
4,A fun toy for baby,"The Oball is a great toy for a young baby. Most early baby toys are hard plastic rattles and this toy is neither hard nor a rattle which separates it from the rest. My 5 month old daughter grabbed onto this at a store and surprised me by playing with it quite a bit.Due to the webbing, it's easy for baby to grasp and hold on to, so this is a great toy for a 3-4 month old to start playing with. As baby ages he/she can roll, throw, and even kick this toy.The Oball is 4.5"" x 4.5"", and made out of a soft jelly plastic material so it's safe for baby to throw. It is PVC and lead free so you'll feel good about letting them chew on it as well."
1,a helpful tip,I want to start by saying that I love these balls. My baby loves these balls. He favors them over more expensive toys. Now I will explain the past sentence. I purchased one of these balls at Target for $2 for one ball. That would make four of them $8. How amazon charges $15 for 4 of these balls is crazy! Plus the other reviewers here say that they only got 1 ball for this price! That's crazy! Go buy this at Target and put the other $13 into a college fund. Sorry amazon. I love you but sometimes you crazy.
1,$100 toothpaste- Homeodente,Homeodente homeopathic toothpaste by boiron? I hope this is a typo- $100??? Please correct the amount on your site. thank you!
2,mediocre,"I began learning Samoan with the use of this book. I ran into a few problems. The definitions are short and, in many cases, inaccurate. I found many words that were archaic. I constantly had to check with native speakers to see whether a word was in use or not. It is very difficult to understand the real meaning of a word because no context is given. G.B. Milner's dictionary is far better."
4,We should all go out on a leaf hunt!,Adventure is all around us if we take it in using all of our senses. Children will love to explore their surroundings after listening to this story.
5,Joyous Day -My Christmas Favorite!,"I have collected Christmas music for over 30 years. When I experienced hearing Barlow Bradford conduct the Utah Chamber Artists in his fresh and imaginative interpretations of carols I was simply blown away. The choir sings with such pure and amazing tone quality, precision and feeling that I often had tears streaming down my cheeks. Now I own the CD and play it many times a day while my other Christmas ""favorites"" linger on the shelf. I never tire of it. The choir is perfection itself, and Barlow Bradford is a musical genius. Anyone who enjoys good choral music will love hearing this!"
3,a romantic drama about music,"I think that the major thing wrong with this movieis that it confuses people about jazz without giving them any ideawhat jazz really is. The idea was to make a drama about a maneaten up by his life in the jazz world.I suppose that the ""product"" likeLust for Lifeis more important than what people learn from it?Don't be fooled: this movie has very little to do with real jazzand the people who play it and love it.The movie is a product made to sell movies starring popular actors.There is actually some pretty good jazz from the 50'sand some big band tunes.I liked the movie when I saw it as a kid, but now,after actually learning about the music, the movie seemreally barren and empty."
2,"For god's sake, read the book.",Warner Bros. works hard to wash all the interesting racial politics from Baker's 1938 novel.
4,young man with a horn,"Though Harry james sound might be different from that of Beiderbeckes's I've enjoyed his brilliant sound. Moreover I could meet Charmichael,Doris day ,Bacall and looks very young Kirk douglas . They are gorgeous!!"
2,"Four Star Music,Two Star Plot!","Buy this for the music,and Doris Day.Then go out and the get the Soundtrack CD,which is out of print.Doris Day,and the trumpet of Harry James...........two of the best ever."
5,Putco 59816 SSR Bedrails,"Really simple to install and great looking. They look so good, I could make a bowel movement. You could too."
2,Sometimes Fun...Mostly boring,"Everyone is so perfectly good or perfectly evil. The hero is perfect in every way. Tortured, handsome, kind to small children and animals. The heroine is beautiful and proud but then sees the light, and her inner goodness comes forth. The villain, on the other hand, actually enjoys killing innocent people, especially helpless women and children.There is absolutely no character complexity, or moment that is not completely predictable."
1,"Sappy, Boring Predictable",Didn't even finish this sappy boring predictable trashy romance novel filled with purple prose and rambling.
3,Didn't live up to expectations,"The reviews for this book promise it to be a basic introductory book for a first year undergrad student. I have an MBA and I talk to to analysts in the semiconductor business everyday. My intention was to get a basic understanding for how microeletronic devices are used and how they are manufacured. I found this book to be extremely slow reading and way too detailed for my purposes. Although it is well written and organized, if you do have a rock solid physics background you may find it difficult to get through. I bought the book based on the review below that referred to the book as ""bed-time reading"". This is completely inaccurate. The book may serve as a supplement to an Engineering class but to even a well-educated person, without a physics backgroud this book hardly qualifies as ""semiconductor lite""."
4,"Good CD, but rythmically off","The CD is a good CD for it's price. HOwever, me and my friend were playing this violin sonata and we wanted to get some interpretations from this CD. However, they are rythmically off in the sonata No 1, 1st movement. They sort of start out like in triplets and the piano is TOTALLY overpowering the violin on this CD. Also, in the end where the violin has the run ups, the tempo has changed compared with the beginning. It's as if the Kaler and SLutsky just went in and said ""okay, let's play this, get our money, and go on to our next track."" However, I only find complaint with the 1st movement of sonata no 1. However, it is still worth a good buy for the price you pay."
3,They are waterproof!,"Bought these based on another review I had read. They would have been a great shoe for our Northwest winter weather, had they provided more cushioning. Added inserts and they make the shoes usable for me."
2,Too skinny =(,"My husband only wears Propets and he has a 15 3E. Normally the Propets are perfect and very comfortable so I decided to buy this pair for him because it looked a little dressier in all black. He got them in and I am not sure if it was a defect on the ones we bought or what but they were super skinny. You could tell just by looking at them that they were way too long and tight. He could hardly fit! Unfortunately they had to go back, but we bought the Propet Men's Travel Walker M Casual instead which fit perfect just like the other Propets!"
3,Returned Them,"Shoes seemed about a half-size large. Amazon also had limited widths available compared to what the company makes. I need a wide toe box and ordered an ample width shoe, which turned out to be too wide and I had to return them."
2,Stiff and uncomfortable,I've tried different insoles in them to make more comfortable and not much luck. Haven't tried cleaning them yet so don't know how easy that will be
3,"Convenient, but not for serious walkers","I like these shoes for just slipping on to hang around or go run errands, but DO NOT buy these shoes for any kind of serious walking. The elastic around the ankle is not tight enough to keep your foot well located. Particularly on downhill stretches, my toes bunched up into the front of the shoes. I ended up with blisters as a result."
4,Great shoes and washable,"This is my second pair. They are comfortable, and being able to wash them with water is a big plus. Buy them."
2,NOT for walking!,"I ordered these shoes for work beauce of a number of positive reviews I'd read about them, however, these are not walking shoes! They make my feet ache just walking to and from the bus stop which is right down the street. They haven't much cushioning, had to buy inserts but in doing so make them extremely tight. The only feature I do like is the easy slide on/off. Do NOT buy these if you do a lot of walking.Still searching for the right shoe. So far, Nike Air Max has provded the best results (for me).Hope this review helps."
3,Not as comfortable as my other Propet shoes,I find the soles on these shoes to be to hard. They sound like a hard soled dress shoe when walking on hard surfaces. I'm going to replace the insoles to see if that helps soften the blow when walking. I do like the looks.
5,"Really comfortable, believe the reviews","I purchased these after searching Amazon for ""comfortable walking shoes"" and saw the 5 star ratings these shoes received. Delivery was only 3 days and they are definitely the most comfortable shoes I've ever had. I wear a size 8 1/2 D, and the drop down menu selection showed 8.5 D(M)and these fit perfectly. The label inside the shoe shows 8 1/2 X(3E) and I don't know why it says that, but they are basically the same size as my other 8 1/2 D's. Also says ""Shock aborber walking shoes"" on the inside, and they appear to feel like I'm walking more erect, and I measured about 1 3/4 inches more heel vs stocking feet, I guess Tom Cruise wear them too. :)"
3,ok,"they are not as comfortable as I thought. Good for the price, very good for the looks. whta the hell"
5,Great shoes!!!,"I bought these for my dad for Christmas, he had broken his wrist and couldn't tie his shoes. He loves them and said they are very comfortable."
2,Propet Slip-on,"This is a nice shoe, but it is loose-fitting in the standard size I wear. A slip-on needs a firmer fit in order not to slip on the feet."
2,not so comfortable!,"These shoes were almost completely cushion free on the soles.I thought they would be something like their walking shoes as I have a bad back, and bad feet.Unfortunately, these slip on tennis shoes were the first real disappointment I'd had from Propet."
1,Way too simple and has errors,"I made the mistake of buying this book in hopes of learning deveoper. Wrong. This book is way too simplistic, and it has an error on almost every page. I wish I had passed on this one."
1,pretty poor book,very poorly laid out and confusing presaentation of both forms and reports. some fairly good detailed examples (if you can find them) but the overall presentation is chaotic.really not worth the bucks
3,Not a must but a very Useful Book.,Thought this book does not explain any of the subjects in detail but it touches almost all the advanced topics of Oracle Forms and Reports. If a lead can get you going and you can get the details yourself... this is the book for you.
2,Not enought technical information,"I am 12 years-old, and I play with Oracle Forms. Even I did not find enough advanced material."
2,Weak if you want Advanced Reports,"I purchased this book unseen <I know better now> it appears to be very good for Forms, but it contains very little information on Reports, none of which I would consider ""Advanced"" <The reason i bought the book>. I do not develope Forms, so this was another waste of money on Oracle Press books."
2,Reports Section is VERY WEAK !,"If you are looking to learn Advanced Reports don't look here. The book is mostly on Forms, and the information on Reports is not advanced. Another waste of money for me :("
1,Disappointing,"This text does not show the advanced components of form and reports as the text promised. Even for the basic material, the verbiage was obtuse and confusing. I would not recommend this book."
1,Advertised 2012 year publication but sent old 2006 version,"He advertised the book as 2012 edition and sent me the old printed version, and book has a print saying that it can be sold only in india. I do not recommend this seller."
3,The Surrendered Wife: A practical Guide to Finding Intimacy,"I can't belive that a book with this title could actually help. I was very unsure about reading this, but I took a chance. Boy am I glad I did. The book is simple and straight to the point. I must admit it really seems to be working. My husband and I really communicate now. I think any woman who has control issues should read this book."
4,Surprised!,"I have found this book to be surprisingly helpful. This book was recommended by friends, so I purchased it. However, the title put me off so much I couldn't open the package for awhile. I made a pact with someone I know who was having similar problems with what the title implied to just start reading. There is some very good advice that does work. I could never let go of some of the things recommended in the book--such as turning all the finances over to my spouse (not that he couldn't handle them). He truly does not want to deal with that, and I like getting the bills paid right away. Also, not saying anything when your husband is driving the wrong way (even if you end up out of state) seems a little overboard to me. All that said, I'm almost done with the book and have seen a change in our relationship. It happened almost immediately to my surprise. So, a book worth reading!"
1,Don't bother with this book,"This book is a PATHETIC yawn, at best. My couples therapist recommended I get The Surrendered Wife to support the work I'm doing with my boyfriend in therapy. I read the whole book, during which I I threw it across the room on more than one occasion, whilst writhing in laughter at the absurdity of the writings. The author assumes that all women are controlling witches who need only to cow tow to their mate to ""make it all better"". It gives advice more appropriate to a geisha than a woman in the 21st century attempting to solve relationship communication issues (unless of course you live in the middle east and are simply looking for advice on how to trim your burkha and serve your master). Save your money. Don't buy it."
4,"I Prefer ""Fascinating Womenhood""","The Surrendered Wife is an excellent book with many good points. There are some areas that I do not agree with, which I will not enumerate here. Overall, I feel that ""Fascinating Womenhood"" presents a more balanced picture of the value of surrendering to our husbands."
1,Offensive and dangerous,"As a man, I find this theory offensive. The author seems to think that either of her two modes of marital practice--bitchy control freak [former] and submissive doormat [now] are the only two states married couples can function in. How about leaving the realm of the dysfunctional and try a healthier approach--mutual respect? A man who can recognize that the woman he married is intelligent, might know directions better than he, or has some expertise in finance or raising children, is not a man, he's a EUNUCH pretending to be a man. On behalf of my wife, a brilliant, funny, secure and loving woman with whom I am privileged to share life, I'd like to say BAH! Anyone who thinks the world evolves into something better by one sex pretending to be less than it is deserves what is coming down the road--oppression."
1,You got to be kidding!!,"When did it become okay for a woman to ""surrender"" her life to man? I can't believe that women are believing this... Ms. Doyle says that as women and wives we should surrend every aspect of our lives to our husbands. Ms. Doyle, should I ask my husband if its okay if I take the pill? What about shaving me legs? It is absurd to think that someone should have that much control over another person. There are ways to improve a marriage: communication and compromise; NOT surrendering! The women that believe what is said in this book must truly believe that women are CHATEL! I know that I am not chatel. I am an both a wife and a woman, and my husband respects me for it."
1,This book is hilarious!,"I bought this book out of a sincere interest to communicate better with my husband. I started reading it on a long car trip, as my husband was driving. I read parts of it to him. We both laughed out loud! He loved the part about not giving him directions while he is driving, even it means letting him cross the state line! COME ON! Who has time for that?? And you know that the minute he realizes you didn't tell him to turn, he'll blame you you for letting it go so far! Oh, and my husband doesn't want to do the finances, so, I guess I can't surrender that. I think this book was written with good intentions, but without a grip on reality! I thought this was written in 1950, not 2001!"
1,Ludicrous.,"This book's only redeeming quality is the entertainment value I got out of sharing its hilarious passages with my husband. The author apparently believes the only way to a healthy marriage is for women to subsume their own selves under a passive, agreeable facade.The section on submitting to sex at least once a week regardless of whether or not a wife is in the mood - and even if she has a medically-based problem getting aroused - was the point at which I concluded this book would hold the honor of being the first book in my life I ever threw in the trash."
1,Surrenedure Your Soul?,"I bought this book and read it simply because I wanted to see if it really was the biggest load of horse hockey that it had been described as being... and it was.Please allow me to tell you where these principles, as described in this book will lead you:You'll lose your soul and become someone you're not. Better to end up divorced and happily alone than to become the automaton of someone else. No matter how well meaning that husband is, you're still a slave... slavery of the human spirit, whether inflicted by ourselves on ourselves or on others is one of the worst crimes to commit.Don't buy this book... if you're looking for a way to be happy, buy Seat of the Soul or Callings instead. Don't follow this complete cow pat of a book... you'll regret it."
1,Marabel Morgan lives . . .,"First, John Ashcroft is nominated for attorney general, and now Mrs. Doyle is on the Amazon Top Ten list. Welcome back to 1955, ladies! You say your husband didn't graduate from high school and you have an MBA? Too bad, he gets the checkbook. Otherwise, how will ever achieve true intimacy? Who needs the marriage of true minds when you can have the same happy relationship that Lassie enjoyed with Timmy. If you're not happy with your husband, get a therapist, a good attorney, or both, but don't ask him for an advance on your allowance to buy this book."
1,This is Just Disturbing...,"Upon hearing the title and the suggested content, I had to have a closer look at this book, and it was even worse than I had imagined. Its stuns me that in this day and age, some women still think they have to let men have all the power and make all the choices just to get along. Of couse your marriage will go ""smoothly"" if one of you submits! But, is a marriage that requires manipulation and some odd power game worth saving? I truly pity any woman who tricks herself into thinking that this absurd view of love makes her happy. How about trying an actual caring relationship between two thinking, feeling adults?"
1,John Gray's Sister?,"If I understood Laura Doyle correctly, a wife should treat her husband as if he were both child in need of constant reassurance of his competance and a father who knows best. For her, the only cure for the compulsive need to control others is to be controlled. This may be the solution for violent criminals who require imprisonment for life ,however, I would hardly consider this an optimum condition for marriage. Naturally, I also have to wonder if this book is really teaching women manipulation of their mates through positive reinforcement. If you read this book, keep in mind that armies surrender when loss is certain."
2,some of these suggestions may be helpful but only,"if they are put into practice by both spouses.Also...the whole money thing is absurd. One of the reason's my family was NOT in debt is because my mother was excellent at finances and my father wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole...just a question though; when did being a feminist equate to being an angry,over aggressive, ""shrew"". When did it become such a negitive thing? What's wrong with wanting equality?"
1,This cannot be serious!,"The very thought that women should give financial control to their husbands even if they aren't good with money horrifies me. If the only way I can have a happy marriage is to pretend to be someone else - someone who evidently cannot make decisions, have opinions, or handle money - then I will stay happily, intelligently single and living in the 2000s rather than the 1950s. Actually, I will look for a man who wants a strong partner rather than a helpless dependent."
1,The Surrendered Wife,"Perhaps I'm missing the point, but I found this book to be disturbing and obviously unscientific. The author proposes that the women give up their say in decisions in marriage, from finances to children. A marriage is an institution in which couples make choices together. A woman who has control complex should seek counseling so her and her partner can work together, instead of one person dominating the marriage. I imagine that only a insecure man has the need to take away his wife's say in the relationship, and a weak woman to voluntarily relinquish it. To me, the proposal seems to be an easy way out, instead of couples truly working out their problems. Furthurmore, the solution is most probably temporary. A woman's job is so much more than trying to keep her husband happy. She is a working woman, a mother, a lover, a partner, a daughter, and a friend. It saddens me to see that we are moving away from the idea of shared partnerships and gender equality."
3,The Surrendered Wife,"I'm not finished yet, but it more or less is an extention to principles of Love and Respect w.o. mentioning God. I think God pretty much authored these principles and should probaby get at very least a mention. So far...so good except for a few contridictions here and there."
1,Feminine Mystique Reincarnated,"The attention this book is receiving both infuriates me and inspires me to read it. The author is no more a feminist than Rush Limbaugh. Try substituing man for woman, she for he, in every example and see if you would recommend this reading to a man to save his marriage. Thank you."
4,the meek and mild wife,i dont feel the book was mearnt for the modern women who is juggling both a career and a home.marriage is compromise on both sides and so a hardworking woman deserves an understanding man. a meek and mild wife in the present times is a lot of pretence except if we can go back to the traditional ways where the man is the provider while the women tends to the home where she is adequately provided for
1,HECK NO!,"Well, if you enjoy losing your identity, then this is the book for you. However, if you seriously are thinking of implementing this ""theory"" in daily life, I suggest you read, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper first. The charcter in this novella is a ""sumissive wife"" and she goes INSANE. As a gender, women have come leaps and bounds since our grandmother's time and this book suggest throwing it all away! The ""myth of equality""?? Excuse me? If we cannot even strive for equality then what else is there? I personally think that I am just as good of a person as my husband... Respecting his ideas is one thing, accepting all his thoughts because he's a man is ridiculous. This book is perhaps valuable as a tool in a feminist class to illustrate the far out ideas of antifemminists and how truly repressed women are!"
3,HARMONY IN YOUR MARRIAGE!,"Back to basics. ""If you want love and harmony in your marriage, treat your spouse the way you did, when you first met and chose to marry each other,"" So says author Laura Doyle. Remember the respect, the appreciation, the consideration, the nurturing, the intimacy, the love, the natural desire to please each other, and to approach life's challenges together as one? Much like the Billy Joel song,""Don't go changing, I love you just the way you are"", Mrs Doyle emphasizes gracious acceptance of your partner in life. In this way, your spouse's natural desire to please you will return. Forget about dominance and control, ladies. Save your marriages! Get back to feminity, charm, and lots of old fashion tender love and care. Surrender does not mean submission, writes Mrs Doyle. It means, ""I am not going to try to change you, I accept you as you are, and together we can achieve happiness."" My husband liked this book, and so did I."
5,"I echo the ""Ignore the Negativity"" Review by reader in CA.","I could not have said it better myself. Ladies, if you're even remotely interested in helping yourself become not only the wife you have always wanted to be, but the PERSON you've always wanted to be, GET THIS BOOK! It really is about ""Humanity 101."" To some, it may seem too simplistic and common-sensical to believe, but life really doesn't have to be that hard, especially with your spouse. Laura Doyle has provided a wonderful service to humanity, the lessons in this wonderful book are extremely valuable. Read this book and you can't help but be positively influenced by it. Even if you hate it, or the concept, I guarantee you will take something positive away from it."
4,Surprised!,"I'm a newlywed with a very stubborn and independent husband. Funny thing is, I am the same way! We got along great when we were dating and on our best polite behavior, but when we got married we began to jockey over who would be the one in charge.This book is great for couples like us. I do not think the ideas in this book are right for everyone. But if you are very strong-willed woman and always have something to say, the tips in this book may help you to realize that keeping quiet could make your life easier.It is also kind of fun to say ""Whatever you think!"" when you really want to say ""That's idiotic!"" I get a chuckle out of that every time.Since I began using (most of) the advice in this book my husband and I have stopped fighting and it is much calmer and more fun in our house. My husband is more loving and affectionate, too.Some of the ideas in the book may not be right for your situation but you can pick and choose and still come out ahead."
2,Sweet and sour,"Ok, so I read this book to see what all the fuss was about. I wanted to totally hate it, I really wanted to...but I have to admit not all of the stuff in this book is trash. I think the whole idea of not nagging your husband to death is nice. Letting go of the small stuff is a good idea. But the rest? Utter baloney. Saying ""I can't "" when you can? Not giving your opinoin, even when he asks for it? Saying stuff like, ""I can't carry {our toddler}. I need a big, strong man to help me""? If this is marriage, I'd rather be single."
1,Look beyond the inane title...,"...to the *insane* content of this terrible book. If you think being a Christian woman means being your husband cook, maid, and sex toy, then by all means, follow this book's advice. If you would rather have an equal partnership where the person with the greatest math skills does the bills and the one who can read the map drives--find something else."
1,Stupid book.,"I read this book because I was curious as to what a ""surrendered"" wife is, or is supposed to be. I wish now that I had those hours back. My happy marriage stems from equality and openness; not weakness, domination, or subterfuge. A real man wants to marry a real woman, not some marshmallow that will bend to his every whim. I would have difficulty respecting my wife if she behaved like this book suggests."
2,To each his own opinion.,"This book is a Dominant Mans Dream if he can get his wife to believe this is the way to make a marriage work.Frankly I think it would work fine for a DS relationship as for the vanilla folks, do not bother.tHE IMPLICATION THAT IF A WOMAN OBEYS HER HUSBAND ALL IS PEACHES AND CREAM IN THEIR LIVES, WELL IF YOU BUY INTO THAT RIDICULOUS NOTION PLEASE BUY THE BOOK AND VERIFY YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BE SUBMISSIVE 24/7."
4,Mostly Helpful,"Following the advice in here will help you in many ways but I strongly disagree with Doyles' principle of not submitting to a man with an addiction. I dont know many men that arent addicted to something: food, money, work, power, sex, nicotine, alcohol, bodybuilding,parachuting, bungy jumping, etc... I think its a ""cop-out"", an excuse not to do the work toward your own growth that needs to be done. If you're a Christian, I can't find where God's Word approves of not submitting to your husband because he has an addiction. However, I found most of the advice to be sound. She explains things well and outlines the ""how-to""s. I found her advice about not giving my husband so much advice was correct. He does listen to me more now. Other ideas worked as well. The book ""Fascinating Womanhood"" by Helen Andelin covers much the same territory but has a few ideas Doyle doesnt. My husband would never have asked me to marry him without the ideas I put into practice from her book."
1,"She's kidding, right? (Give this negative stars)","I would say that this woman is a supreme idiot, except that she's actually making money from this drivel. It saddens me that we're still even debating such pathetic foolishness in the 21st century. I REALLY do not believe for one second that God gave women brains, but She doesn't want us to use them.One admittedly extreme case in point: my sister-in-law always ""deferred"" to her husband because of her ""surrendered-wife""-type beliefs. Then one day, her husband told her that he felt ""worse than he ever had in his life"". He didn't want to go to the hospital, and she let the matter drop--because HE was the man and automatically knew best, right?I'll bet you can guess the rest. My brother-in-law woke up the next morning just long enough to ask for an ambulance before he passed out, stopped breathing, and died of a massive heart attack.And that's all I have to say about that."
3,This has posistive and negative advice,"I was curious about this book, so I took a peek inside to see what all the hub bub was about. This is the kind of advice book that has you shaking your head in agreement, and a few minutes later, you're head would be shaking the other way. This has great advice on how a wife or girlfriend should watch herself when talking to her mate. Too many men have said that ""she is always nagging, and I'm just tired of it!"" This book helps you control that, to a point. But, at the same time it takes you back in time when women are supposed to be in a position where the man can do what he wants without the woman saying anything. I know the author doesn't mean for this book to give that kind of advice. Nevertheless, there it is. This is still a good read though. Just ignore the parts that take you back in time. If anything, it helps you see yourself if you are too critical about your mate. This should be part of your library."
1,Evolve to a Spiritual Partnership,"If this kind of subtle manipulation and surrender of SELF-ESTEEM is what is required to achieve the outdated goal of staying MARRIED, then I'll remain happily single forever. Sometimes, a goal like staying married isn't at all conducive to personal growth which is ultimately a commitment to onesself. Anyone who has read this, should also read Zukav's Soul Stories and ask themselves if they're married to a New Male. If the answer's yes, then by all means, surrender. If the answer's no, run as fast as you can to a good therapist. Make love to someone when you don't feel like it?? Maybe the largest question is why don't you feel like it??? I'll take a spiritual partnership that might end over a lifelong marriage of surrender any day."
3,"""Bits n' Pieces"" have value","No book should be taken as a whole ""religion"". The idea of this book just made me think a bit more about those little ""uneccessary"" controls I place on my significant other. Personally while I would probably never agree with the authors ideas regarding money and such, it has helped me to release some other aspects in my lover's life that I really don't need to be wasting my time and energy in trying to control ie. how he dresses, how he drives, what he reads, how he communicates with HIS family, etc. There is value in this book in helping you re-think some aspects of your communciations in much the same way that ""Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus"" did."
5,Very moving,"This review is purely about the song, not the quality of the CD or the recording or anythign else. I found ths song most moving. Think a baby being born and telling its parents ""here I am""....I loved the number, and Bryan Adam's voice really does it justice"
1,Here I am CD from Bryan Adams.,I will never use this way to buy a CD in my life.The sound quality of the CD is terrible.I can't even use it in my car. The plactic cover was broken so I think I wasted my money.Next time I will visit a professional store and that it.Thanks.
5,Latin-American maestros at their very best,"This recording brings the music of great composers from Mexico,Brazil,and Argentina.The Huapango by Moncayo is played beautiful and a well performed solo for trumpet and trombone.Sensemaya is played with virtuosity.""Estrllita"" is the best known of all Mexican song here arrenged for strings is very charming.The ""Trezinho do Caipira"" by Villa-Lobos is performed here to great effect by the orchestra and its percussion section.The Obertura Festiva by Halfter is performed with grace.Galindo's ""Sones Macriachi"" is also a piece where a mariachi gorup is immitated also to great effect by the orchestra and I think that Mr.Galindo captured the spirit of Mexico very well here.Its a great recording.Thank you Naxos... Well done Mr. Batiz"
4,Muy Bueno,Muy Buen Producto. Llego a mi Domicilio en tiempo y Forma. Lo recomiendo a todos los amantes de la buena música
5,GREAT BOOK OF COURAGE AND HOPE,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK OF GREAT COURAGE AND HOPE ! ""LIVING IN GODS LOVE "" BY BILLY GRAHAM IS A GREAT COLLECTION OF ALL OF HIS SERMONS FROM HIS RECENT NY CRUSADE AND THERE ARE ALSO SOME PHOTOS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN YET. THIS GREAT EVANGELIST CAME IN 1957 TO NY AND THIS BOOK RECENTLY CAME TO NY RECENTLY AND THIS BOOK ""LIVING IN GOD LOVE"" HAS ALOT OF SERMONS AND THE NY CRUSADE AND THIS BOOK HAS ALOT OF COMFORT AND PEACE AND HOPE. I REALLY LOVE THIS WONDERFUL PAGE TURNER. PLEASE GIVE A GIFT TO A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER OR A PASTOR THIS IS A REALLY NICE BOOK CALLED ""LIVING IN GODS LOVE"" BY BILLY GRAHAM"" GREAT GIFT FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL."
1,Would give it zero stars if I could...,Very poorly written book. It goes over the concepts and theory but show absolutely no practical applications or how to implement the theory in code. Avoid at all costs!
5,Passed the first time,"I studied using this exam prep to point out my weak areas. It is more of an exam prep than a study guide, as it is mostly a bank of questions from actual exams. This book is not to train you on how to be an electrican, it is to train you on how to think like the exam so that you pass the exam. It also takes the time and care to point out the changes from the NEC 2005 to the 2008.I passed the practice timed final exam in the back of the book with an 83, passed the actual exam with an 85. Don't think I would have passed without it.Highly recomended."
3,Not as Good as I Hoped,"The questions asked don't follow the flow of learning that I use. The order in which they're asked is not how you would normally think when you're doing electrical work. Didn't work for me, but maybe for some others it would be okay. I'd bet ""okay"" is about as good as a review will get on this book."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,The best thing you can do with this book is try to recycle it. It is a complete waste of money.
4,Diego's Jeep,"Came so fast ! in excellent condition, really easy to asemble, exactly like the one in the picture, the size is perfect for two kids to play together, even I can fit inside and play with my son ! I'm small by the way... hahahaha... my son is having lots of fun. I just have to contact this people and ask them because in the description it said that comes with an inflatable chair that didn't just came with the bag and the sterring wheel. Still recommended 100% looks very durable."
3,Much loved piece of junk...,"For about the first week this thing stood up ok. It is much loved and played with often. About 3 weeks in, the cheap fabric tore on the seam between the hood and the headlights. The little light things that velcro to the top are a joke and were lost almost immediately. Once it is out you cannot get it back into the bag, so prepare to have a permamnent spot for this tent available.Having said all of that, my son loves this tent. He plays in it often and likes to ""drive"" it using the blow up steering wheel.All in all I think it's a piece of junk, but can't get rid of it because he thinks it's awesome. I would not buy it again."
3,"Unless they love Diego, it may not be worth it","I bought this for my nephew for his 3rd birthday. He thought the whole 'tent' idea was pretty neat, but was more excited that Diego was on the side of it.He climbed in and out of it a couple of dozen times, but would easily get hung up in it. It is flimsy to allow for easy folding, but it would also cause the 'vehicle' to try and fold when caught by a small foot.Now, I see it in his room, up against the wall; he never plays with it. In fact, every time I see it, it is almost folded up because a 3 year old boy is just too rough for such flimsy material."
3,Go Diego Go Rescue Truck Play Structure,"This tent-type toy is about as durable as can be expected when two young children both want to play in it at the same time. It is easy to set up, but it's also easy to collapse when children are in it. I'd still recommend it."
2,Not the best Fit.,"We have used a lot of these vents and have never had any trouble, but these do not fit tight and are already starting to come off. We checked to be sure we got the right product for our make and model car."
3,Knights of Christ,"It's a decent DVD, tends to adhere to the same focal points as other produced on the Warrior Monks. Would be a good addition to a school's library or history section."
2,The covers the best part...,Below average production values. Was it shot in a basement with a green screen?It needs a professional sound engineer to fix the audio quality.When the narrator quotes passages of interest his voice almost drops to a whisper and can't be understood over the WAY too loud background noise of music and/or fighting.Honestly I couldn't finish watching it.
4,Best Available,"The author is a trifle chatty, but covers the material well. Make sure you get a copy with the disk included - the printed examples are not quite complete enough to build the applications without it."
5,I'm The husband-to-be of NYC reviewer,"As the prospective husband-to-be, it is wonderful to hear excerpts that my intended reads to me when she comes across something that really hits home (which happens constantly). We fit the profile presented in the book to a tee and I find myself identifying closely with many, many things in the book. Preperations for Long Island style wedding celebrations can be lenghtly and exhausting, and the day can wind up being quite expensive. They are generally geared to those that we have amost 20 years on, and some of the pagentry borders on the uncomfortable. Instead, the book is written from the perspective of us ""40-somethings"". I have actually had the feeling of relief descend upon me after hearing the common sense ideas and flexible approach that is typical of the book. So, I say ""Way to Go"" Shelly Christiansen, and ""Thank you"" too !"
4,Very Pleased,This was an excellent read... written in a manner which made topics fun. It is a not a detailed how-to with timelines but more of a 'here are a few things you need to be thinking about'. I really liked the author's tongue-in-cheek style about mid-lifers and so much of it rang true for me. Perfect pre-lude to other wedding reading/organization responsibilities. So glad I ordered! Enjoy!
4,Third time's a charm!,"As a third time bride (I'm remarrying my second husband; does that count as one or two?), I found this book full of interesting information that is helping me plan my wedding. I especially like the author's statement that the only rule is that there are no rules! I highly recommend this book for brides who aren't part of the younger generation."
2,Not very please,"I have bought several melissa and doug puzzles for my nieces and have been very happy. This one is the exception however, it is not very easy to put together. Too many of the pieces are almost the same and with the puzzle being the same colors across the board it is a nightmare especially for a young child.My 7 year old loves puzzles and she is good at putting them together. She was very frustrated with this one. So was I and I am 40."
1,frustrated,missing pieces frustrating to work on this only to find there are missing pieces. This is the second time this has happened
3,P'shaw,"I have had these knives for over 6 months now. They do what they advertise - cut, but I've had some problems with them as well.1) I TOLD my husband we should hand wash them, but he threw them in the dishwasher anyways and they rusted a little after sitting in the dishwasher overnight (I was able to scrub the rust off, it was superficial). However, steel is not supposed to rust (Hence the ""stainless"" part...right?) So I was a little confused about that.2) Last week as I was cutting into a rather frozen Quorn 'roast', the tip of one of the knives broke off into the food and I had to dig it out with a lot of effort. To be fair, the 'roast' was very hard and frozen...but I was surprised at that, too.Other then those two issues, I don't mind these knives. I wish they came with a knife block, and I wish they didn't rust (?) but I still use them everyday -- even the one without a tip!"
2,Not the same...,"We have been searching for The ORIGINAL McCormick Chicken Seasoning forever it seems. This is NOT it!!The taste is not the same.The aroma is not the same-even though it says ""original"".Very disappointed."
3,meh,"buy it if it's required for class, but it is difficult to find what you're looking for, and not so easy/fun to read. It serves, but maybe not as well as some other book could."
4,6 feet of audio joy,"I used this to plug my computer into my monitor's speakers and I'm very pleased. The product feels cheap, but does the job well."
2,Panasonic KX-TG5438,"It's a really great phone, It does'nt reach out as far as my old Panasonic 2.4GH."
3,Low quality base microphone and speakerphone,"I received the phone yesterday and have been playing with it for a day. It looks nice and has good handset speakerphone/microphone sound. However, the answering machine quality is poor. The sound quality from both the speakerphone and the microphone on the base for the answering machine are unsatisfactory. Another annoyance is if a power failure occurs, the date and time need to be reset, although messages are not lost."
1,low rage but many functions,the main problem with this phone it's the range. Mine has a range of like 45 feet. It has so many cool function of wich like 80% are totally use less. So this phone is more like a toy phone. Wish you luck if you buy it.
2,Bad microphone,"Have to agree with #5 who said earlier the microphone pickup is bad. We've used this phone for 6 months now and most people ask us to speak up or tell us later they have a hard time hearing us. I have even taken the phone apart and removed a small screen that cover the microphone hole, but it doesn't seem to help. There doesn't seem to be any settings to help either. SO, in summary a nice looking phone, great featureset but LOUSY microphone pickup."
2,Berniw,"Mediocre docu-drama that tells only a part of the story. Wouldn't have watched if not for the all star cast, but even they could not save this film."
2,good acting not much of a story,"A lot of murders are by people who have been pushed, or think they have been pushed, too far. In addition the statement that the prosecution never has a trial moved is just not true.(e.g.civil rights cases in Alabama). Just because someone is obnoxious does not entitle you to shoot them. Why did Bernie not just walk away like the rest of us would have done?"
2,"True story, yet dull and only mildly interesting.","I would have rated it a 0 star if possible. However, many of the interviews were from real towns people who both my wife and I thought were so bizarre that they had to be actors. Jack Black and the rest of the cast did a fine job in their roles. The truth of the matter is that it is a dull story. Very dull. Torture to finish."
1,Disjointed film,I found this to be a totally disjointed effort. I did not like the presentation of the storyline. The characters were not interesting. It was a poor film.
1,worst movie I have ever watched,"what a piece of crap , which is to bad with some of the actors that were in it they should give a award for worst movie this one would win.............."
1,Terrible,This movie was very slow moving and did not appear to even have a storyline. We turned it off after about 20 minutes of boredom and my oldest son asked if we could get our money back.
4,Black is great as Bernie,"True story, very touching and intriguing. Black shows a new side of his acting, he's serious, funny and charismatic. Matthew McConaughey does well too, as always. He's a very versatile actor nowadays."
3,Not what I expected,"There was SOME humor in the movie. That being said, it does star Jack Black and I went in expecting MORE humor. Maybe the problem was in my expectations. Shirley Maclaine is a wonderful actress, and she gave me the performance I expected. The ending really left me flat."
4,Really funny,"Not exactly Oscar quality, but an enjoyable way to spend a light-hearted evening. Crazy - funny, when you realize it was based on a true story. Jack Black can play anyone!!"
5,Wow - i live near here and had no idea!,Great quirky little movie about true life events. Loved the way they interspersed the commentary. Loved the 99 cents stream..
3,A little disappointing.,Has a few god moments but overall a little slow and disappointing. Not your usual jack black air. Watch only of you are a huge fan!
3,Once was enough...,"Would be 2 stars except it was based on a true story from a small Texas town and there are a few good quotes like 'Bernie was light in the loafers' from the local people used in the film. But still, once was enough for this film... will be a long time before I want to watch again... if ever."
3,bernie,"Although I grew up in Bastrop, Texas where most of the shooting took place, I did not enjoy the film because it was so repetitive and ssimply boring. I would say the plot was basicdally well intentioned, it was poorly presented. I did enjoy the church scenes. I was a member of the First Methodis Church of Bastrop. I also enjoyed seeing many other landmarks, including the Bastrop County Courthouse, the lost pines of Texas and the downtown of Bastrop. So, overall it was not a total loss."
5,Texana in a movie,Great movie and the actors were wonderful. Accents reminded me of my childhood town. Jack Black is more amazing each time I see him in a movie
3,It was OK.,It had its moments. It wasn't the best movie that I had ever seen but it wasn't the worst. Its worth a look.
5,Wow! these can't be real people,"Having lived in East Texas for a stint, I was amazed by how well some of these actors portrayed ""deep east"" Texas people. Then upon further review, I found out these were real east texans! I cracked up. The movie was great, in a dark sort of way. Would definitely suggest it to others."
4,True Story,Wasn't sure if I was gonna like this movie. .glad I rented it. . .Jack Black did an amazing job. The true story part was what did it for me but the movie was actually worth the rent. . .definitely a must see.
3,quirky but ultimately misses the mark.,"an interesting opportunity for a fascinating character study. but jack black just shows us the surface of the character, we never get to see beneath the exterior to see what makes him tick. shirley maclaine plays her usual grumpy self."
3,Bernie,"After all the reviews, I was a little disappointed. It had a great premise but it seemed to plus along with very little drama. Bernie was a Casper Milquetoast and then to do what he did was incredible. But there was.no build up."
5,bernie,loved it shared it with all my frieds and relatives jack black deserves an oscar and so does texas. texas was a main character
2,Mockumentary Style,"I really don't like programs wherein the story is driven by fictional interviews about the main character. To me it's lazy and almost impossible to pull off. This film is in this style and suffers because of it, in my opinion. Had I known it was in this style, I would have avoided it."
3,Odd movie,I read the reviews which gave this movie high marks but it was hard to connect with the characters or the plot -- the mock documentary style was overdone and at times tiresome.
2,Eh,"This was so weird, and boring. Really not even worth rating it - but I felt others should know before they spent their money."
5,LOVE!,"LOVEEEEE this movie!!! Jack Black is BRILLIANT in this movie, he plays the part of Bernie perfectly! The movie is hilarious!"
4,"Real Bernie, Real East Texas","I grew up in East Texas, (1940s). The characters and characteristics were spot on. Only in Carthage & East Texas could this weird state of consciousness exist; Evil good trumps good evil. The attention to detail in the interiors; homes, cafes, public buildings, was authentic, apparently all the shots were do on site, very nice. Bible-belt B*S* as an art form and very well done. Enjoyed the scenery, Piney Woods Modern...almost made me home sick."
3,Not a re-watcher,"I thought the stars and the description of the movie made for something that might turn into a favorite. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case for me. I found the movie to be ""just OK"", and won't be interested in watching again."
3,Slow Moving,"The movie has a great story and the characters are quite interesting, but the movie takes is slow in getting to the idea."
2,Not as funny as we thought,"This isnt the normal funny movie that these actors are usually in. Yes, some parts were funny, but not what we were expecting ."
3,It is East Texas,"I'm from that area. It's dead on with the people, and storries like that happen there all the time. Was impressed with the casting, and I think they used local people to make it more real. I may have been less entertained because it seemed nothing new to me and from that area. I said that already didn't I?"
2,not that interesting,"Story line seems silly, I did not have any connection with the characters. lost interest in film pretty quickly. would not recommend to anyone."
1,"Boring, comes across like a childs school paper","If you want to waste time and money, which was easy to do here, this is the movie. It is not hilarious and it was a waste of good talent. Just because Jack Black and Shirley Maclaine were in it does not make it good. If anything, they were probably bored that's why they agreed to it or they knew the director and owed him/her one. I won't waste my time trying to figure it out. There were no good releases yet this month, everybody saving them for Christmas. I would suggest alot of wine, this is a long, long, dull ride. I left after he kills Shirley. YAWN..."
1,blank tape,I cant get it to play ... it is blank...... just previews come up from other movies........ i am going to send back... and I so wanted to watch it..... hope none of the other tapes r blank..kathy
1,Bernie,I was looking for some humor but it was all about a deranged guy conning everyone. He was not a complete evil guy but apparently loved the limelight. I was disappointed.
1,sucks,terriable waste of my time the worst jack black movie so far and not mention it really is slow and repetitive waste of time and money
4,Enjoyable movie,"Enjoyable movie. A great look at Southern characters and small town life. Plus, loved the cameo by Matthew McConaughey's Mom."
5,Great movie. found it free on netflix after purchase,Jack Black is a gift to the entertainment industry. I love that it's a dark comedy on a strange true story.
3,Not what we were expecting,"Maybe we were leaning too much to the comedy side but this movie was not as entertaining as we had hoped. Just could not settle into it. There were brief bits that hinted at entertainment. My husband gave up on it but I forged on hopeful that it would pick up. Sadly, it seemed to fizzle at the end.It was made even more awkward when we realized it was based on a true story. Am I the only one who thinks a murder case is not material for a black comedy????"
4,Great movie!,"I missed seeing this movie when it was released, really glad I got it for my Kindle. Jack Black is wonderful in this movie which is based on a true story. Strange story but really well acted."
3,OK,I was anxious to see this movie because so many of my friends recommended it. I thought it was OK.
4,Strong Movie,"To start with, Jack Black is excellent here. I hadn't expected that. He's perfectly cast and he nails it.This film is a character study, and a darned interesting one. Classically good film."
4,A memorable movie,"Well, there is no question but that the movie accurately depicts life in East Texas as I have experienced it. It was a bit disconcerting to find oneself entertained by its portrayal of a true story that ended badly. Watching the credits roll at the end of the movie is key to understanding its underlying realities. I must say, it is hard for me not to like Bernie, just as many of his friends and neighbors like him. . . except for that one, particular, momentary flaw in his otherwise exemplary character.""Oh, THAT one?"" you ask.Yes, THAT one, but a person must see the movie to know what that solitary, tee-ninecy flaw is and what heavy consequences Bernie suffered because of it.As to casting, I thought the actors were ideally suited to their roles."
5,Bernie Movie - GREAT,"This is a wonderful movie, super funny - good for all family members. Town members shown in the film were a hoot, being from Texas I can recognize the attitude. Will enjoy repeat viewings in future."
2,Slow Moving,This movie was very slow moving. The acting was very good but the story line was pretty thin (based on a true story) and the ending was predictable and went nowhere...in my opinion.
2,"high hopes, but ultimately a fail","I love this cast, but ultimately this movie was a fail. The first 30 min seemed so fun, but then when it just kind of dragged. I can't believe I'm saying it, but I wanted a more polished hollywood ending or story. it's always a joy to see Jack Black sing -- always good for a laugh."
2,Repetitive and Odd,"This black comedy, which is based on a true story, is repetitive and slow moving. I'm surprised it got so many good reviews. Jack Black is brilliant in his role but otherwise the film is a docudrama/black comedy that has some laughs but many of the scenes are redundant. Pretty much a bomb. If you like weird off-beat films or are a huge Jack Black fan add a star. If you're curious, rent it, don't buy it."
2,Bernie,"I thought I would enjoy Jack Black and Shirley MacLaine in this movie, but I didn't. I am from a small texas town and I thought the setting might also provide some comic relief, but i didn't care for the accents or stereotypical characters."
5,Oscar Worthy,"Jack Black and Shirley MacLaine deserve Oscars for their performances. Nearly as perfect a movie and slice of America as Fargo. Laugh out loud black comedy is nothing short of a masterpiece. A crime if not nominated for Oscars all around, and the best movie of 2012."
3,left me wanting more.,the movie was alright but not all that. don't expect a nacho libre type of movie. i wanted more funny jack black/maclaine antics.
5,Wonderful Movie- Humorous and Passionate,"I can't say enough of this movie so I will summarize saying it is the most interesting movie I have seen this year. To my surprise the credits at the end showed a single name for many of the ""actors"". After looking into the actors we learned that many people interviewed in the movie are from the actual town and that this was based on a true story. Amazing and very entertaining!"
3,Very Entertaining,"Jack Black and Matthew McConaughey [sp?] both give very solid performances in this true story about a funeral assistant director who loves his town...and who the town loves back, except for their confusion regarding his relationship with a wealthy, dark-hearted old bag, played by Shirley McClaine.The story moves along happily, and the biggest laughs come from the ""interviews"" with the townspeople who talk about Bernie.Recommended."
4,Bernie a character for sure,BernieI loved this movie and I actually saw it in the theatre and wanted to watch again to see what I might have missed. Jack Black played this part so good as I had seen interviews with the original Bernie and he had him down to a tea. I think I like characters that are different than everyday Joe and Bernie was that so I would recommend this to anyone with those likes.
2,dumb,Boring jack black not that great of actor but really had no storyto it. Nothing exciting. People who say dumb movies are great would probably say this is a good movie.
3,It was ok,"It was ok, it was more like a dollar rental though. I liked that it was a true story. Again, just ok"
4,Post-mortem bliss,"I only like strange movies, I liked this one. It's not the silly J. Black comedy you'd expect, this film is about a mortician. I only wrote these last two sentences to reach the word limit on the review, the first sentence is my real review."
5,Very interesting and a true story.,Wow! I didn't know Jack Black could sing that well. He also did a great acting job in this movie.
3,Well made but weird,"This whole movie was a bit weird and disturbing, which I guess was the point. However, being a Jack Black movie I expected something funny, and maybe that's where I went wrong. In the end I wasn't sure if we should be blaming the perpetrator of the crime or the victim. Just realize going in what the movie is about, that way you're not surprised."
3,Authentic people,Jack Black is good in this role but the townspeople are the stars! The narrative style takes a little getting used to.
4,Good Watch,"This was a great telling of a true tale. Not following the format of most hollywood films, it just basically tells the story and ends. I guess there's so much content to ponder already, there was no need to exaggerate. It was a great dark comedy. The kind of movie that sticks with you for days after and can be the subject of conversation and debate for those who see it. Enjoy!"
4,Bernie delivers,Jack Black was fantastic as the effeminate Assistant Funeral Director.....very enjoyable. Very well done script about the goings on in East Texas.
3,Jack Black is superb as Bernie,"Bernie is played by Jack Black, a effeminate assistant funeral who is amazing at his job and a pillar in the community. Bernie falls in love with someone who is completely his opposite, Nugent ( Shirley Maclaine) after meeting at her husbands funeral. She is vile, possessive and an exact opposite to Bernie.The director combines real folks along with professional actors to piece together the story about Bernie and how he came to kill Nugent. There is also Matt Mcconaughey, in an unrecognisable get up,plays the lawyer who tries to prosecute Bernie. This is a watchable film about the triumph of justice over goodness. 1/30/13"
1,more like a documentary than a movie.,"Not sure how this got such good reviews, but my guess is that it is all people involved in the small town where this store/documentary was written for who liked it. It's about 70 percent interviews of people that knew Bernie and about 30 percent actual movie. It's like watching a metronome that speeds up occasionally."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This has got to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. A friend recommended it to me since I just moved to Texas. This is a clear example that men and women have different views of what funny is. It is based on a true story; one that really isn't funny. I'm not sure why someone thought this story would make a good comedy. It should have been make into a documentary, not made into a comedic movie. The best part of the movie...is when it was over. If you're a guy...this might be funny, but ladies...move on to something else; something with substance."
4,"Bernie, the good guy?","Bernie is unique, a generous and loving man who is religious and probably gay, a fellow lured into the good life tied to a rich woman's whims What he does is wrong but understandable. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys simple life in a small town.."
3,i knew bernie and jack black is no bernie...to quote a well known politician,"aside from abysmal performance by bernie's ""love interest"" - jack black's performance was jack black performing. not an a movie, not even a b movie...a c movie maybe even!!"
2,Jack Black was good.,"Jack Black showed his range in this film, however, pretty slow overall. Not very invested in any of the characters."
2,Bernie,"It was an interesting movie. Jack Black acted the role of Bernie very well. Although i gave this movie only 2 stars, it is worth renting. It is not a family type movie."
1,stupid,It was sooo slow and really dumb. all about this guy trying to woooo people after their loved ones died. I shut it off after 15 min. Would not recommend to any one.
2,Very Wierd - I was waiting for their to be a hook but I missed it!,If your a real Jack Black fan only! This is a wierd one for sure and a not to be misses MISS
2,Beirne,I thought this movie was a little slow. I would not rent it again. There were good stars in it including McConahy and McLean. But other than that I did not enjoy it.
3,True portrayal,This movie is a true depiction of the lifestyles of people from East Texas. It was more like a documentary than a movie.
1,Bernie,"Bad, Bad, Bad. This was a waste of my time. I can't believe anyone liked this movie. ""Time slowed and reality bent, on and on the egg man when."" Save your money."
1,Bernie,"Bernie was awful, I expected to see a dead man acting funny but this wasn't the same Bernie , even though it was made to look like him."
3,Bernie,Bernie was a sad character that lived a pathetic life. This film was a black comedy that focused on the life of lonely people. How ironic it is based on a true story.
2,Not worth the time.,"Clever twist of interviewing actual residents of the town who knew the subject of the docudrama, but it just comes off as silly fluff."
4,"Good acting, funny, and a true story!","I have always been a fan of Shirley McClaine and she played her mean spirited role to the hilt! All these years, Jack Black has not been on my ""good actor"" list and now is because he plays the role of Bernie to perfection! What can't he do? The comments by the town characters add to the humor. Just a fun, light-hearted movie about a tragedy that has become all too common today. If you want to laugh, see Jack Black at his peak, and see Shirley McClaine in another crotchty role played for all its worth with a good supporting cast including the residents of Carthage, Texas...then buy this movie to add to your comedy collection.It was packaged very well and arrived within two days after I placed the order."
2,too much Tex,not exciting enough. Jack Black executes well but story lacks interesting content for my taste. Some stories do not need to be retold.
2,Disappointing,"I heard this one was very funny and worth owning. From my perspective, that isn't good information. Amusing snippits cause burst of laughter here and there, but it's just too black. Bernie is more pathetic than amusing. I wish I rented this one and sent it back."
2,To true to be entertaining.,"""Bernie"" is a movie based on a true story. So much so that it is painful to watch. Please read about this film before you rent/buy. Because unless you enjoy a pointless non-climactic snore fest, this movie is not for you. It should be classified as a documentary that uses actors to recreate all dramatizations making up the film. To top all of this off it uses real people (directly interviewed and filmed with less quality i.e. no HD) who knew Bernie himself, which in my opinion makes it even more intolerable. What a waste of time. Fortunately it was forgotten from my minds eye as soon as my physical eyes where relieved of duty. However I must give it two stars as the acting, and only the acting made me stick it out to the very end."
2,So long to get funny,"I did not buy it, simply rented it. I was watching it with friends and one after the other, they all left the room because they were so bored. We all expected so much more from such a good cast; it should have been better. Sorry, my first bad review, but I felt that I had to share my opinion."
3,Weird flick!,"I was told this was kind of a weird movie and they were right. Being from Texas, and the fact that this is a true story, is about the only reason I saw this. It was interesting to see Jack Black in this role."
3,Bernie,"We thought this was a comedy. Even though it was welldone it was not very entertaining. In fact, it was depressing."
4,Pretty Good,I like Jack Black and enjoy his performance in this movie. Matthew Mc... overdoes it a little for my taste. All in all an enjoyable experience.
5,Excellent Movie,"No hollywood explosions, impossible car chases, ex or retired 23 year old CIA who happens to look like a model. Just a good storyline with some humor mixed in and some good acting on the part of Jack Black. Very well done movie.."
2,Not what I expected,This movie was more like a narrated documentary based on stories from people who knew Bernie. Very strange concept for movie writing. Did not find this type of movie entertaining in the least bit.
3,Not that bad...,"I did not read any previous reviews about this movie prior to my rental but I love Shirley Maclaine and didnt think it would be a time killer. The movie is based on true events. I enjoyed the interviews with the local town folks, whether they were actors or not, mainly because they brought added humor in some scenes, but they gave the viewer more of an opinion as to how everyone viewed the main actors. I believe JB portrayed Bernie very well; however, he was hard for me to watch at times because I have grown accustomed to his comedic roles. Not a GREAT movie, but not that bad."
2,So-so Movie,"Friends and I got together for a pizza and movie night. We all love Jack Black, and the rest of the cast, so this was a natural choice. It was an okay move but nothing great. I think one of the detractors was because there was a running monolog throughout the film. None of us left feeling like this was a great movie. or even a really good movie."
3,Kind of interesting psychological study,"The actors were good, but the script was not that entertaining. Mathew McConaughey provided a few good scenes of comedy. The interviews of the local people, who did not appear to be actors, were very interesting."
3,Not too bad,"I thought the movie was so so, but my wife really liked it. I will say, I thought the acting was pretty good."
3,Bernie,"A black comedy, that seemed slow at times & too much Bernie. But at the end it said TRUE STORY!Then I changed my view. It WAS good. Black & McLaine were terrific together."
3,"Fun, But Not Great","Mildly entertaining, but not a great movie... Jack Black and Matthew McConaughey's parts are quite predictable. Still it's worth the rental fee."
4,Bernie,This was an unusual movie for Jack Black to do. It was different from his other rolesHe performed this role with flying colors
5,Bernie brought us alive with laughter,"""Bernie"" brought us alive with laughter- The East Texas mortician-excuse me, Funeral Director, had the right lines in this funnymovie. McLain and McConaugh were the right complement."
2,Not what we expected...,"This was based on a true story, and reminded us of the old 20/20 dramamentary crime series. It played more on character than plot. We kept thinking the story would ""go somewhere"" but it never did. Ends pretty much where it starts. Performances from Jack Black, Shirley Maclaine, and Matthew Mcconaughey were solid, but not enough to make us like it. We felt the money spent to rent was wasted."
3,Bit boring,"Sadly not worthy of jack blacks talents, hard to getter, sympathy for any character.I wouldn't waste my time watching this."
4,Liked it,"I liked this movie, it was funny watching Jack playing a serious role and also knowing he was playing a real life person."
4,Highly Entertaining,This movie was far better than I expected. Shirley MacLaine was wonderfully evil and hateful. Jack Black was stunningly believable as Bernie. I recognized all these characters from my childhood in NC as a So. Baptist.
4,Bernie,Great funny movie. Jack black was incredible. The town comments Aldo made the movie good. Would recommend. Ddid not believe it was a true story
3,oh perilous world leftovers,"This album sounds like the leftovers that didn't make it to ""oh perilous world"". It is very good, but short and doesn't really stand on its own. If you're a fan of Rasputina, definitely pick it up- it will fit right in."
5,Cool Jazz,This is a superb album filled with warm tunes and superb musicianship. Great to hear Stanley Clark in this setting rather than some of the bland funk-jazz he's been releasing over the years. McCoy is on top form and Al Foster never fails to provide the perfect backing.Buy it - you won't regret it!
5,Flows Like Honey!!,"This mellow cd has a very fine flow to it. It is brilliant! McCoy Tyner's fluidity on the ivories never ceases to amaze! And this cd is focused on McCoy's magnificent talent. Stanley Clarke and Al Foster accompany McCoy perfectly. If you love McCoy, you will love this one for certain!"
2,Not what I expected,"I expected a more contemporary book meant for today's young girls. I bought it (for a 19 year old). I found it amusing as to how we ""girls"" of the 50's, 60's and 70's use to think but come on, what young girl today knows who Patsy Cline or Nat King Cole is when picking out the right music, or wears stockings and even knows what a stocking seam is? The book is dated and as I said, not what I expected!"
4,Cute and a good start,"I personally thought from what I've read (over halfway through) that it's a very cute book. I'm new to the ""upper class"" and wanted to get a good start as to what I ""should"" know about fashion, social events, etc. As some have mentioned, yes, a lot of outdated things, some common sense... but if you want to at least get a start of what direction to head in, good book. It wasn't a boring read. I grabbed this from the library and since it's a few things in there I wanted to keep up with, I'm just purchasing it used. Just from reading it, I want to learn poker and chess now. I'm far from ""stupid"" as I have 3 degrees... I guess being so busy with school and a single mother kept me away from knowing some of these things."
1,Are you kidding me?!!,"I got this book as a Christmas present and still am not sure if the person who gave it to me fell for the other idiotic recommendations or was intentionally being rude. I like to think of myself as a self-assured adult lady and having been raised properly in the great State of Texas, I believe I was brought up with enough manners to know that passing this book (or anything similar to it) to anyone else would be an insult! Certainly by the time a woman reaches maturity she should have acquired enough knowledge to know who to apply an adhesive bandage and how to eat with a knife, fork and spoon. (I kid you not, this author actually thinks women have to read a book to learn these things which should give you a lot of insight into her abilities.) I kept looking for some inkling that this was written tongue-in-cheek but could not find any. Please do not waste your money on it - unless, of course, you intend to insult someone with it and then, best of luck to you. One word - DUCK!"
1,there was no lower leveled book than this crap,it is an insult to all woman. i tried the demo (thank god i didnt buy it) and it is by far the best book a woman an read to become a lip glossed high heeled diva bitch. nice work ammatures!
4,HOW TO WALK IN HIGH HEELS: THE GIRL'S GUIDE TO EVERYTHING,"I bought this book as a present for one of me female friends and I only got a short read of it before I gave it to her but I really liked what I read. I think the book gives a great insight to how the womans mind really works and espiaclly loved the chapter on how to dress and what shoes to wear with what!! A really great, girlie fun book!!"
1,Only if you were neglected,"If you didn't have a momma to teach you what's what, maybe you would buy this book. Still would be a rank substitute for a few classic movies and an observant eye towards REAL class. Come now, ladies. Anything that tells you to watch Mtv? Devil's highway. Better paths to walk, the icons never needed a book cause they KNEW."
1,An exercise in desperation,"Oh how disappointed I was by this book! Although witty in a few places, it read very much like someone trying very hard to create something that just wouldn't come together. I'm a Brit living in Canada, and excused the parts on electronics that would have little value for anyone on this side of the pond, but the rest of the book was so utterly juvenile that it seemed written for a child. How to thread a needle? Cook bacon and sausages? Come on! Oh yes, and someone once told me he valued our friendship too much to ""risk"" it by dating. We've been married for over 25 years and are looking forward to the next 25. And he's not a liar :) I'm assuming the never wear heels under 5"" bit was tongue-in-cheek. The book started out in a promising note but, by the time I'd dragged myself to the end, I'm afraid it only qualified for one star."
5,"you gotta buy this book, giiiiiirrrrrrrlllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","it's awesome!!! things that I knew already and some that I didn't really think of... written in really funny way. Great for ALL girls at all ages, I would recommend it for some guys, too... ;) GREAT BOOK!!! get it!"
4,"Excellent book, disappointingly organized.","While seemingly comprehensive with over 500 poems, the book is disappointingly organized and has no biographical or historical information. The table of contents is alphabetical, by poem name, but there is no organization by period, subject, geography, or even by alphabet. There is an index of first lines, which works unless you only remember some of the later lines. Footnotes are limited to definitions of otherwise obscure or unknown terms, but they are very helpful.However, these shortcomings do not detract from Kipling's poetry, which can be quite moving."
2,Ridiculously Disorganized,"Lord, what did the Publisher do? Type the poems on 3x5 cards, shuffle them and present the totally random result? The poems follow no order at all. Early is mixed with late; India with the sea with World War I. The book cries out for an editor, an annotator, anyone! The publisher should be ashamed."
1,mismatched shoes,i'm terribly disappointed in this product. i ordered it and received two shoes with different clasps. looks funny on my baby boy. very angry customer.
4,"So cute, I want a pair!","These shoes are super cute so I just had to get them for my 6 year old daughter. She currently wears a size 2 1/2 and had complained that her shoes were starting to feel tight.So I went ahead and ordered her a size 3 in pink. When the shoes arrived I opened them up and thought ""hmm these look kinda big"", I mean I don't have small feet but I'm fairly certain that I could almost wear these!My daughter tried them on and yep too big, but she will grow into them in no time. Since I got a great deal I'll hang on to them and buy a 2 1/2 and those should fit just fine."
3,Uncensored? True. Extended? No.,"I'm writing this as a consumer suffering the buyer's remorse. I love Star Trek, and I love Comedy Central's roasts. Both appeal to very different parts of my mind, yet ""meld"" (sorry, had to) nicely. At least for me. I saw this broadcast late-night on CC, and it was great. I would give this product 5 stars if it was complete. As others here have noted, it is not. No Nimoy. Shortened segments. Extended? I think not. For those who haven't seen the full broadcast it's still worth seeing, but avoid like the plague if you want to see everything as it should be. And to all of you who were so deeply offended by this, relax. Shatner didn't care, why should you?"
1,"Needs to be shot into a black hole, in a galaxy far, far away","I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed by a ""celebrity event."" I used to say, ""Heck, I'd watch William Shatner read the phone book,"" and now I'm sure that would have been a better use of time (his AND mine.) Full five stars to Leonard Nimoy for not participating in this crude, cruel, and contemptible exercise. There were a couple of very funny moments, as when one of the pack of ""comedians"" did a spoof on having to have a speech coach ... for years ... and years ... to correct ,,, his tendency ... to speak as Shatner did and still probably does in Boston Legal. My advice: go watch old Star Trek, old TJ Hooker, new Boston Legal -- anything but this nasty bit of trash. Can only hope he got paid well for participating."
1,To Star Trek fans with class: stay away from this one like the plague,"Parents, do not let your children get near this movie.There was so much good Shatner material to satirize. Why did they stoop so low? My guess: laziness.This was the first Comedy Central roast I've watched. Are they all this lame and boorish?"
2,Intellectually lazy childish nonsense,"If you care for wit and original humour, enter not ye here! The roasters must have been sharing notes before they hit the stage because all of the jokes centred around homosexuality, bodily functions and other schoolyard themes. Extremely crude material elicited visible winces from the audience. Is America entering the final decadent slope that precipitated Rome's decline? It appears that cable TV (ie comedy channel) has truly become no-holds-barred and is running roughshod over any semblance of class. Is mainstream society getting dumber, where they cannot comprehend intellectual wit anymore, or just cruder? I leave that to you reader to ponder..."
3,Buy it for the Tranya,"I agree with many reviewers about the crudeness. Most of the humor is not that funny, just shockingly rude. And I have to admit that making so many harsh gay (not that there's anything wrong with that) jokes about George Takei (Sulu) wasn't that funny either. Just crude.Don't get me wrong, I am opposed to being politically correct. I can crack a lot of harsh jokes (jokes mind you) about race, religion and sexual preference. But I simply got bored with all the rude Gay Jokes. George seemed to like the jokes or the attention.However, to me this roast was worth it to see Clint Howard reprise his role as Balok (is that how you spell it??) from the episode THE CORBOMITE MANEUVER from the first season of the original series of star trek. This had me on the floor and wanting to tell all my trek friends about it. I am buying it just for the Tranya."
5,Captain Kirk... Denny Crane... Bill Shatner.. and Rocket Man?,"I was never a huge Star Trek fan, but I understand the culture and contributions to modern sci-fi series it gave us. I also know that Bill Shatner, despite being rammed for his 'overacting' is considred a household name in entertainment.I am also a HUGE fan of the Roasts, and I must say this one is now my favorite, even more then the infamous Pamela Anderson Roast, or Bob Saget.Betty White tells some greatly offensive jokes that completley caught me off guard, and the actors who played Uhura and Sulu also appear (warning: George Takei had just 'come out' before this roast was filmed, and is the focus of ALOT of mature gay jokes) Just as dirty if not more then previous roasts I highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Shatner, filthy comedy or Roasts in general."
3,Flimsier Than Expected,Good content but flimsy paperback. Expected better paper quality and more vivid illustrations from this publisher. Other Usborne books on this period are much more visually impressive.
4,You will not fail,"As an immigrant to Australia I used to get baffled by the some of the social expectations that I never learnt or witnessed while growing up in India. If a non Westerner behaves differently in a social setting, Westerners consider it rudeness rather than ignorance. This book covers most of the aspects of Western style etiquettes. And it is covered in such a simple way that within a week I felt quite comfortable in most social settings. I think that any person who is new to Western culture should read this book."
3,It does the job,"I bought this book hoping it would be somewhat of an advanced etiquette course, but this book appears to cover more of the essentials and foundations. It is still great material to cover if you haven't done so. I was hoping for more of the formalities that only a select crowd follows and the historical origins, I just chose the wrong book for my purposes."
1,Too Many Scanning Typos,This has been scanned in for Kindle and it is close to being unreadable because of the scanning errors.
4,"too cold to fly, might as well read","its a ok mag for the price, it is sort of hard to come up with thirteen more words to describe the magazine other than this"
1,Not Worth It!,"Everything about this rag is horrible. The editorial is boring, products are out dated, and the pics are pathetic, and the subscription is a nightmare.I highly recommend Model Airplane News or Backyard Flyer. They have been publishing since 1929. The reason why they have been around this long is because their editorial, product review, pictures, and how to's are excellent."
5,The way olives should taste!,"These olives are great!They have a crisp and clean taste, not like some store bought olives in those open bins that taste old or rancid and most of the time too salty.A good quality product for a good price!I will be back!!"
3,way too much salt,"Hey there Olive Lovers. Everyone knows that Green Cerignola Olives are the best in the world period. I was hoping to save some money and get these firm, green meaty olives instead for a substitute. They do have the nice meaty texture and authentic feel, but these olives are terribly salty. If they would have cut the salt in half, that would have produced a much better olive. I make a funny face when I eat these becasue of the overly strong saltiness...oh well....back to the Best! ""Green Cerignola Olives"" for me.Cheers"
3,Important work of Japanology,"William George Aston was one of the three or four major British japanologists of the 19th century, along with Ernest Satow, Basil Hall Chamberlain and Frederick Victor Dickins. As such it is good to see this book, or rather half of it, available here. It is the first ever English translation of the Nihongi and is full (perhaps too full) of copious annotations.Ernest Satow wrote in a private letter to Dickins on April 26, 1896: ""Aston's translation of the Nihongi, Vol. I, reached me the other day. It is a capital piece of work. It is a subject for legitimate pride that this and the Kojiki have been Englished by us, before any other Europeans."" It has also stood the test of time quite well.Ian Ruxton, editor ofSir Ernest Satow's Private Letters to W.G. Aston and F.V. Dickins: The Correspondence of a Pioneer Japanologist from 1870 to 1918 (Paperback), also available on amazon."
3,Average game experience,"I was expecting more from MOH this time around - they did add a few new features that I like (i.e. the concept of a medic to heal you instead of hunting around for health packs) but the graphics and environement has fallen way, way behind it's far superior counterparts such as Call of Duty. There were numerous bugs and the limited interaction with the surroundings (you're forced down very narrow paths) made the game frustrating and frankly rather boring. I wouldn't purchase it again and I think this will be the last MOH I pony up for."
3,not bad,i have a p4 2.4gh. 640 ram. 40 gigs. 128 geforce nvidia pci video card. i was able to run the game well on medium detail. there is a slight problem with the color buts its not to bad. this game was made to be like call of duty but failed horibly. it should of been more of the mohaa stlye. the first 2 of 5 levels are boring and have about zero action. but the next 3 levels are awsome. its sort of cool fighing in the jungle but not really. just really realistic. some levels are lame b /c they make u protect some hill for like 20mintues straight. dont buy this game untill its 30$ or 20$.
3,"Not too bad, but suffers from unrealistic scenes, play","I have played a lot of war games and my father-in-law has been in WWII in pacific, Saipan, and some other really horrible places. He agrees that while the overall scenes are pretty realistic, some of the gameplay is sorta out there! The Bonsia charge is real. But five planes attacking one sub and all making hits if you don't knock all the planes out of the air is a bit stupid! Yes, the game does suffer from slow loading and it does have MEMORY LEAKS! But all in all its not too bad. Once you get over the stupid parts, the game itself is okay. The people at EA need to calm down though. Every scene is viscous and according to my father-in-law that's NOT the way it is...So, get real EA! Get lean! And Get RID of the darn memory leaks! (I have 1GB of Real Memory and this thing with patch 2 starves for Virtual Memory, and I have 200GB of RAID Storage!).Want action? Want SPEED. Get Quake IV...!"
3,Eeeh its okay,"Well, when I installed this game on the computer I waswondering if my comp'd be able to run it. It ran fine, evenon the highest quality(although I did have to turn the resolution down a notch). I was hooked on this game, for its immersive storyline and realistic combat. However this game does have negatives. 1. Though you'll get hooked on it(maybe not if your preffer Call of Duty) you'll only get hooked, and play it all day straight for only ONE day. And then it's likewhen you replay it its not that enjoyable. The audio is good, though some sound skipping does occur. Their is finally some blood shown in this game. If you REALLY like the MOH series, pick this one up, you'll like it. However, if you preffer Call of Duty buy that instead"
4,Get down! now throw a grenade private!!!,"I love the Medal of Honor series, they just seem to be getting better and better. The thrid in these series is pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. I still think the first one has the best graphics, but at least in this one, you can ride more vehicles and even fly planes. Caution, when flying planes, you may suffer from vertigo, but it's all in good fun - Unless you're on medication. A good buy, but with Halo 2 out, maybe they should have made this a littler cheaper. WHAT?? you know I'm right dude!!!!"
1,read system requierments before you buy,"This is the third MOA retail verrsion I have bought and my last. The first 2 would run on my OS (98) but this one will not, win 98 is not suported. I would give it to someone with XP but I,m going to light in on fire first then piss on it just the way E Games pissed on me."
5,"Immersing, thrilling, all around fun","This is a great game for someone who likes their games to have a bit of plot and background to spice things up. The gameplay is great, and the loading screens aren't THAT bad. They're kind of long, but not hard to sit through unless you have crippling ADHD or something.Yes, this game has some cutscenes and mandatory training you have to go through. Don't like that, and just want to blow stuff up? Buy a different game, this one's not for Halo kiddies."
3,Missed the mark,"I looked forward to this game and although at times it is fun, it is also, at times, lame. The Pearl Harbor scenario is a case in point. The graphics are great and the action is good but then you wind up shooting down tons of planes when in reality the Japanese lost 29 planes in the actual attack.Most of the ground missions (like Makin Island, Guadalcanal and Tarawa) are great. But then you do something lame like fly a dive bomber or shoot down 10 Zeros (carrying torpedoes) from your submarine.The aerial scenario is extremely lame and I could have done without it. Marines are Marines and Navy aircrews are Navy aircrews (airdales) and I didn't understand why the developers felt this was a good idea.I am being extremely generous giving this 3 stars."
1,Not as Expected,"I am a fan of shooting games, i own almost any game of this type once its in the market, Medal of honor was amazing game, overall i will give them 4 - 5 stars. Just this one is a very bad one and i never expect to be that worse. Its a very long loading game, with high PC requirements eventhough, don't bit you gonna play with it without sudden interrupt !! hey, any one would buy this i will take his hand and show him CALL OF DUTY 2. Just as you expect and little more.I think i need to buy a new computer each year to play a new game from ELECTRONIC ARTS. guys, your old games were fantastic, don't upgrade too much."
4,Good Game,"Everone says they want the most realistic game and you get it here. You think the japs didnt do charges or stayed up and trees, either ur computer neirds or you dont know anything about the fighting in the pacific. Call of duty takes place in europe hello not the jungles two different places. Dont get me wrong Call of Duty is the best ww2 game out there. But dont give bad rewviews if you dont even know anything about the fighting in the jungles. I was in Vietnam I should know."
1,Check the fine print,"Check the fine print on the system requirements. I got this game for Christmas, installed it and found that it SPECIFICALLY rejects my video card (Nvidia GE Force 4 MX)."
1,Another Non Starter,"This is another game from this manufacturer that refuses to play straight from the box. I have a system that exceeds the minimum requirements and a video card that it says works fine with the game. However, the game refuses to work, just the incompatible card message pops up all the time. No matter what additional drivers are installed or additional tweaking...it matters not. These people should be sued for poor performance. Let the buyer beware."
3,More of the same...except...,"Pacific Assault is more expansion pack than new game. The opening sequence at Pearl Harbor is excellent. Afterwards, the action is similar to previous MOH's. The reason? Most of the development crew moved on to create the far superior Call of Duty. And the new A.I. they tout? It's a load... enemies are more effective in groups, but the action ends up the same old thing. Unless you are passionate about the MOH series, save this for a $20 pick-up."
1,Dont Buy This Crap,"Every Medal of Honor is terrible, Never even consider wasting your hard earned money on any Medal of Honor game. Even if your money comes easy to you it would have better use if you threw it in the trash or burned it than spend it on this crap. Go buy Call of Duty."
1,Never received this order,"I do not know if this was shipped to a different address, but I can say that I never received this order or another game that I ordered, I highly suggest not using the postal system for delivery, always use UPS."
5,This Game Looks Great,"I cant wait to get this game. I have 5 Medal of Honor games. I have Medal of Honor Rising Sun, Medal of Honor Frontline, Medal of Honor Allied Assault, Medal of Honor Breakthrough and Medal of Honor Spearhead. I liked them all. I also want Call of Duty Finest Hour for PS2. I cant wait."
1,Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault,"This game is just awful. Extremely long load times, and choppy game play even on the most powerful of PC's. The forced registration took almost 12 hours to complete because EA's servers were down, and I could not play online until I registered. The multiplayer levels are rich in textures, but poor in gameplay. Having been a HUGE fan of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and Spearhead, I could not be more disappointed by the game. Call of Duty offers a much better multiplayer experience. I don't know what the folks at EA games were thinking, but they have a lemon on their hands with Pacific Assault. Its just a poorly designed game, and I don't think a patch will save this one from being $19.99 in a bargain bin in a few months."
2,Style over Substance,"My SYS SPECS: P4@3.0/800fsb ...RAM - 1gb DDR2 ... Card - Radeon X800SE PCI Express 128mbYet, I had to turn down the Video Settings. The gameplay didn't make up for the demanding SYS REQ. Choppy/Jerky/Slow gameplay and the graphics weren't all that great. MOH:PA almost brought my machine to a slide-show gaming experience.I have virtually nothing running in the background + turned down my desktop resolution to 800x600.Games like Line of Sight:Vietnam; Deadly Dozen:Pacfic Theater and Marine Sharpshooter 2: Jungle Warfare all did a nice job with jungle/foliage, while keeping the SYS REQ within reason."
3,"Fun, but !","I had two problems with this game. The first is the time it takes to load. The second is the fighter aircraft. Since when does a ground pounding Marine Corp grunt fly a fighter aircraft?I think this sequence should have been left out of the game. The game was great until I got to this part. Very hard to control the plane with keyboard and mouse. Other than these two things, I enjoyed the game."
4,Awesome game!,"Awseome game great action and one of my favorites. The squad action is great, game play is good, missions are excellent. Probably the coolest thing about this game is the interaction with your squad and the realism that involves pacific warfare. Only drawback is the first island mission for some reason it bogs down and feels kinda like slow motion. I think it might just have been my computer cause i had some trouble installing it. Other than that great game!"
1,Disappointing,"I loved Medal of Honor on the Xbox/PS2, so I thought I would give this a chance. As an experienced gamer, I had high expectations for this game. Big mistake. Took forever to install, and the load times are horrendous. I start playing the game, and I get to a part where I need to rescue a wounded soldier. I can't even get through the doors below deck because of the fires, and everytime I attempted it, the guy I was trying to rescue was burned to death.This game is terrible, not what I expected. I uninstalled it and got rid of it. I do not recommend this game to anyone except diehard military fans."
1,to simple and basic the title was misleading,when i bought this book i thought it would have went through the process of building a trailer with some basic designs but all it did was talk about the individual components of a trailer and what they do . any person that wants to build a trailer already know what those components are and what they do on a trailer.so i did not learn a thing from this book and was very disappointed in it. and i am still looking for a book that has some trailer designs and tips for building a trailer.
1,Aaargh! Gives small press a bad name,"Wordy. Wordy, wordy, wordy, wordy. How trailers may be made wrong; this way, that way, another way. Elliptical at many times, dancing around a topic.Why does it take a Realtor(tm) or realtor or whatever to buy or sell a house, but an EDITOR is optional for small presses?!Vol. 1 is near useless, and vol. 2 is worse, unless you want to design FROM SCRATCH. Not like building a PC from a Zenith kit in the early 1980s (which would be a good parallel to a helpful book on trailers), but like learning CP/M, integrating motherboard and all components YOURSELF, and calculating, calculating, and calculating.If you still want to see the few directly useful pages in these books, pursue through interlibrary loan, which your library will be happy to do."
4,Don't Pull Trailers Without This Book Knowledge.,"For a technical ground-up creation, these books are a must. Also very insightful in evaluating existing trailers: thanks to Volume 2, I found that I had drilled holes in an inherently weak point in my Kaufman car hauler -- I won't make that mistake again. I would like to see a volume devoted to cookie-cutter recipes for standard designs, put together so that the recipes could be mixed to create hybrids. (Maybe the makin's for a Volume 4?) Meanwhile I anxiously await Volume 3."
2,Drifting off focus,I got this book to obtain the trailer specific structural design considerations. What I perceived was more of an attempt to teach a strengths and materials course. While I can understand the need to have the strengths fundamentals I feel the book was unable cover the material. The effort to cover the strengths material appeared to crowd out the trailer specific application material. Unfortunately the material crowded out was the material that I bought the book for.
1,Don't buy this book unless you plan to buy Vol. 2,"I agree with the fellow who said this book is a bit of bait and switch. Everytime I thought he was going to get into the real details that I wanted, the author just referred to one of his other books. Without Vol. 2 this book will not give you enough information to build a trailer.It does provide some high-level information, and might get you to asking the right questions, but for the price it ought to answer some of those questions. I cannot recommend this book."
1,Trailers - How to design and build Volume 1,"Absolute GARBAGE. What a waste of my money. I expected to be able to build a trailer when I finished this book. NO WAY!! A whole lot of what not to do, and not much of what to do. I didn't think it possible to have read so much and have learned so little.There are too many refernces to other volumes. This volume could have, (should have) been reduced to one or two chapters and then... "" get to the business of building trailers."" After reading this book, I have great reservations about buying volume II. (I agree with the other person that stated they wish they could give a zero rating)"
4,Discover Latin Dance,the instructions are very easy to follow. a beginner dancer can easily learn the steps. we are using the dvd to reinforce what we are learning in a dance class we are taking and use it to practice. you could easily learn the dances directly from the dvd.
3,Discover Dance: Latin,"You could learn the steps with these instructors, but they are very stiff and seem like robots. Not my idea of fun instruction. Found it hard to concentrate on lesson."
1,Horrible,This DVD is a horrible example of Latin dancing. The steps are extremely difficult to follow mainly because they are shown at such a slow pace that it makes it more challenging. I have taught ballroom dancing and this dvd made it hard for me to follow. It's not enjoyable to watch and there are errors on the dvd itself where there is supposed to be dancing and there isn't. Even for a beginner this dvd is not worth buying- you could learn more from reading on line how to do a dance rather then attempting to watch this video.
2,Wonderful resource for some allergies -- but not others,"""My House Is Killing Me!"" is a wonderful book with lots of great information for people who are allergic to mold, mildew, and dust mites.Contrary to the broadly worded title, this book contains relatively little information for people who are allergic to tree pollen, grass pollen, weed pollen, pet dander, and chemicals (i.e., chemical sensitivity). Unfortunately, I'm allergic to everthing on the second list and nothing on the first list. So, most of this book wasn't very helpful for me.However, if dust mites, mold, or mildew trigger your allergies, you will find this book quite helpful. Each chapter addresses one room and ends with a list summarizing what you can do to improve that room. The book contains numerous stories about houses triggered allergies of these sorts, why, and what can be done about it -- the presentation of these stories was too mellodramatic for my tastes, but the advice appears to be sound and well considered."
2,not really universal,"This is supposed to be ""universal"", meaning for both side and front mounted handles. But if yours is a side mount, you need to physically bend the plastic with your hands and hold it until it reaches a 90 degree angle. That's difficult, and in my case, it keeps bending back toward straight. The result is that it doesn't fit right, and ends up getting stuck in position against the side of the tank - leaving the water running. So, it's fine for a front mount toilet, not for a side."
5,The Complete Still Waters Rosary,"Beautiful music and adoration CD. Love it and would recommend it to anyone.Fast, speedy delivery. Great service."
3,Rosary CD was a little disappointing.,"The recording had all 4 mysteries, but they weren't complete within themselves. The first one had the beginning prayers and the last one had the concluding prayers. I like each mystery to be complete within itself. Also, I had hoped for added reflections besides the standard ones with each decade. I recommend the CDs by Fr. Scallon & Dana."
2,Left me flat,"Seth Godin is becoming the new Tom Peters. I found very little of substance here, which surprised because I enjoy his Fast Company column. This was just a lot of high minded columnist talk from someone who will never have to do any of it.I prefer more down to earth authors who offer practical advice, not a lot of evangelist sounding advice."
1,POOR ITEM,"WHEN THIS ITEM ARRIVED, THE MAIN PACKAGE WAS GREAT - THE BATTERY PACKAGE APPEARED TO BE REALLY OLD. ON LOOKING THRU THE BUBBLE I NOTICED THE CONTACTS WERE DISCOLORED. WHEN INSERTED IN MY PHONE I COULD NOT GET IT TO MAKE CONTACT. VERY DISAPPOINTED - FIRST ITEM I HAD TO RETURN. AMAZON DONE A VERY QUICK REFUND FOR ME NOW I AM HAPPY AGAIN THANKS AMAZON"
5,christmas gift,great price compared to local vendors- loved that it was hard cover! I live in Charleston SC where the author lives and writes about- this is a good deal.
3,Not the easiest to use,"If one is looking for a recipe in a logical sequence, forget it! The stories appear with recipes at the end. Finding out what recipes are included is not fast. This book is all about ""process"" ."
4,The Pat Conroy Cookbook: Recipes of My Life,I am entranced by Mr. Conroy. This is possibly because many parts of his life sound so familiar to me. In this memoir/cookbook he once again is enchanting. He fills me with joy/sadness as I recall similar memories. My favorite author. I wanted to make all of the recipes immediately and did so on a number of them. Some were excellent and some not so excellent; however the stories behind the recipes kept the disappointment at bay. I continue to try the recipes. Next is the pickled shrimp.
4,Almost a cookbook... definately a good read!,"If you like Conroy you'll love this book. As with any cookbook you aren't going to like everything and I think this cookbook fell just short of average with the number of recipes that have caught my eye. It's also not a cookbook for the kitchen novice.As a book of short stories I loved it! It's part background (and I would guess a healthy dose of fiction) on recipes and people who have made Conroy the cook and author he is today. This book provides a culinary backdrop to the life of Conroy and help explain what he was eating when he wrote about the food and characters in his books.This isn't the book I'd recommend as your first, or even your second Pat Conroy experience, but I do feel that your Conroy experience isn't complete until you've read this book."
5,Food memoir,This book is a paean to mostly lowland cooking and Pat Conroy's real-life experiences. Don't expect The Great Santini but some wonderful recipes and well written reminiscences.
5,Excellent Foodie and Other Stories,"Loved this book. I had not read any Pat Conroy books until this one, even though I had seen several movies based on his books. I am now a book fan as well. He talks about cooking as I would if I wrote. Stories are at the heart of every meal and his are heart touching, revealing and entertaining. The receipes are wonderful and the stories just as much so. Thank you Mr. Conroy."
5,Conroy's Latest Delight,"All of Pat Conroy's books reside proudly on my bookshelf. I started collecting with ""The Water is Wide"" and ""The Boo"". I have followed his career with joy for his well deserved success in literature. In ""The Pat Conroy Cookbook: Recipes of My Life"" he treats us to a witty and emotional memoir interspersed with his culinary expertise garnered in France, Italy, The South, including Atlanta, New Orleans, Mobile and the low country of South Carolina. It's another ""can't put it down"" Conroy book, only there are many wonderful recipes to please the discerning palate -don't miss this one!"
5,A great read! Bravo!,"I haven't tried any of the recipes, but absolutely LOVED the essays in this book. Most of them are hysterically funny. I've never read any of Mr. Conroy's novels (though I've seen the films) -- but I certainly plan to read them now. The book also makes me want to visit the Carolinas."
4,Lao's review,"This is one of the more useful general histories I have read. Divided into sections by dynasty, each section details the accomplishments for that period, as well as the events leading to the demise of that dynasty. I found it useful in that it discusses the influence that outside groups have had on Chinese culture (in more detail than other general histories I have read)."
5,Fantastic,"Very few bands can successfully combine folk, rock, blues, and psycadelic pop into one unified sound, but Five Man Electrical Band pulled it off with flying colors. Every song here is of high calibre, and for those who have only heard ""Signs,"" that is actually weaker than many of the cuts on this disc. True, the sound quality isn't sterling, but the quality of the playing and complex harmony vocals cuts through any technical imperfections. A must buy, even if it is hard to find."
4,Finally found Signs,"A lifetime of searching for an mp3 version of signs, ended with the purchase of this cd. well worth the cost"
4,A breath of 60's fresh air,Good music from back in the day.This was a very underrated band and listening to them is a pleasurable trip back in time.
4,Good episodes of our friends the teen titans,"The kids got MANY hours out of watching the various teen titan episodes. If the kids appreciate Cyborg, Beast Boy and crew, then they will like this."
2,"Cute, but very small","I bought this for my miniature poodle but it is way too small for her. The puffy sides use available space in the bed making it smaller than it looked. Price is kind of high for the quality. It's very cute, but more appropriate for a toy or teacup-sized dog."
4,Not quite...,"I do like this CD, but I found the shorter version of Live in Dublin, to have many of the same songs in a better format. I really like this band, but you do get a lot of repeat songs on their CD's. I would recommend the Best Of...CD to anyone with little knowledge of the band. Good place to get started."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I thought this book was awful. I could barely slog through it. Toward the end contained so many typos that apparently the proof-reader at the publishing company agreed with me. If you are just going to completely ignore any historic context (characters speaking the term ""titanic"", social norms of the 18-teens, etc.) then just save yourself the research trouble and set your story in the modern age."
3,A fine book -- but hardly erotic,"The title of the book is somewhat misleading -- this book is far less erotic than most romances these days. Aside from using a few somewhat raw words -- I won't quote them in this review, but I bet you can imagine which they are -- the story is in fact rather tame. Certainly it's less steamy than anything by Emma Holly, Lisa Kleypas or others who are considered to write ""hot"" romance.It is a good book, however. The writing is fine, the mystery is somewhat engaging and the setting is well detailed. The characters are nice, their love affair is nice -- the book is just plain fine -- not bad, not spectacular."
2,Not that great,"Rather overhyped, nothing to rave about here, just fairly ordinary writing. There's much better out there"
5,THE BEST OF THE THREE!!!!!!!!!,"When I bought Wacky Races, I thought it was very exciting and entertaining. But when I got Dastardly & Muttley, it was slightly better, just shorter cartoons.Enter Perils Of Penelope Pitstop, this show was much better! It was more adventureous than it's predecessors. It had more of a hero, also. The only smidget flaw is that I think the villain needs a better laugh, but it's not a huge problem with me.These shows were longer (20-21 minutes approximate runtime), and I love Janet Waldo! I think she was perfect for Penelope! I loved Paul Winchell & Mel Blanc. Don Messick kinda reminded me of other voices but he was good.Now, I don't know if Paul Lynde was right for the villain or not, but otherwise, a great DVD! If you're looking for action, adventure, & comedy all rolled in one, get this DVD!!!My Score: 9 out of 10 4.75 out of 5"
5,super clarity,"Just watched a couple episodes,Well worth the price,Packaging solid.Colors in episodes very distinct.Better than wacky races.Hope they continue the hanna barbera lines."
2,"Some good advice, but unrealistically optimistic","This book had a good, concise overview of the procedure (including helpful forms). However, in my experience with completion of both a master's thesis and doctoral dissertation, I found her timelines to be extremely optimistic, especially for dissertation research."
4,At least I'm laughing,"I am one of the many who have been ABD for several years now. This book may have a very tight timeline that may not apply to all areas of study but it does make some very good points. It's an easy, enjoyable read that had me laughing. I feel much better about the position I'm in and about my ability to finally write the dissertation. I would recommend this book to anyone who is feeling run over by the process."
3,Not the place to start,"This collection concentrates on late 70's/early 80's Ben. This is not considered to be his best period (60s to late 70s). Not that this collection is bad, but this won't do as a Jorge Ben best-of."
3,Much larger than pictured,"If I had a hawk or fully matured amazon it may work. The thickness of this perch is huge, I purchased a small version of this and it works for my grey."
3,"Only two good songs, but they are GOOD","The Fixx fell a bit short on this album, but managed to produce two great hits on it. It contains ""Stand Or Fall"" and ""Red Skies At Night"", two of the best songs produced by The Fixx. If you like the band, you need to get this CD."
3,Cheesy Mac,"This is an Australian compliation of early Fleetwood Mac, pre-Bob Welch pre-Lindsay Buckingham/Stevie Nicks. This is mid/late '1960's when Fleetwood Mac was a blues based ship and had Peter Green, guitarist, as the stalwart captain, with the stern helmed by Mick Fleetwood, and the bottom based John McFie.Fleetwood Mac had some success with American FM radio, but nothing that propelled them into hit waters. Like many Briish blues bands that took their compass from US Rhythm/Blues/Race records, they crossed choppy waters and sunk.Still, Fletwood Mac survived, life boats afloat with safety jackets tossed from Santana (""Black Magic Woman"")and San Francisco KSAN radio, to reinvent themselves.This CD has bunches of the early MAC, nicely recorded in stereo, and a primer for the early days. Highly recommended, but still a BOX SET would be nice..."
5,Moments in Love,I love this cd...I listen to a Jazz radio station and was always thrilled to hear this piece. Now I can hear it whenever I want. It always puts me in a good mood!
4,Nice Collectors Addition,"I am a huge Art of Noise fan. This is a nice addition to add to your collection. The only reason I did not give it 4 stars is because a couple of the songs was mastered from vinyl, but still sounds good."
3,Sleeping pill,"While chock-a-block full of facts, this tome is not only rife with obvious and often appearing bias, but it's a bit of a snorer. It takes a particular skill to take an interesting subject and turn it into a truly dull read. While I realize the pursuit of knowledge shouldn't require out and out entertainment value, people of the author's ilk could do the Ivory Tower set a service by sticking to reading and researching, rather than writing. Case in point: At her bedtime, I can read to my 4-year-old daughter for an hour from my Physical Geo book and she not only doesn't fall asleep, she asks me questions about it the next day. However, this book guarantees she'll be out in ten minutes or less. I was initially excited when the book arrived, though some of that was built up by an inordinately long wait for delivery, but my excitement dwindled proportionately to the number of pages read..."
5,Interesting book,"It is quite interesting and covers a large number of areas. It expanded my knowledge. Also, buying it used is very inexpensive."
2,Not Good,"Just not a very good book. Poorly written. LT's arrogance really sticks out...he makes several ridiculous statements about his NFL career and his personal life. This makes it hard to feel any sort of compassion for him. It just makes him seem like an animal. A decent read, but don't expect anything much."
4,LT is the man,"This book was so awesome! Another great book - at least if you're a guy - is The Nice Guys Guide to Getting Girls. I am a huge football and Lawrence Taylor fan. He was a tough, wild, courageous player who didn't let injuries stop him from performing on the field...and performing at his best. This book illustrates a kick-a** football player that gave into a world of temptations, but recovered and put his life back together."
1,I have a good idea for you and your cousin...,"Take a fifth-grade level English class. From what I hear, it is very possible that a lot of what is in the book is a lie, considering that Bill Parcells was the coach of the Giants at the time and he's not exactly a pushover. Taylor's ramblings on the Dan Patrick radio show (11/3/03), in which he said that he basically did not want to answer any questions about Parcells, are curious considering he just published a book about the same topic... The man was a tremendous athlete but to purchase this book is a waste of time and money because this man is the NFL's Jose Canseco...a s--tstirrer of the highest order. Just buy Barry Sanders' book instead and that way your hard-earned money won't go to buy #56 some more CRACK. Nuff Said."
3,Lawrence Vs. LT,"LT is very honest in recounting the disturbing details of his battle with drugs and a lifestyle that ultimately was out of control. Yes he became a different person as LT and lived off the field witht he same wild abandon that he brought to the game.The stories are entertaining if somewhat predictable. Drugs, sex, more sex, etc...MY problem with the book is that while Taylor is attempting to demonstrate his contrition for his bad behavior , especially toward his family, the tone of his descriptions of the wild times comes across as giddy and bragging.The guy was the best football player I've ever seen and I am glad he landed on his feet after going through all of this."
4,Reader Pleased with Amazon Book Purchase,This book was exactly what I needed. I recently came into possession of a print of one of his paintings from 1926 and it made me want to know more about the artist. I was pleased with the book and am still enjoying it. I was especially interested in his association with Picasso. I'm glad to have received the book through Amazon and the illustrations are awesome!
3,It is incomplete,"In it has not been included ""Bonny"" and ""Looking for Atlantis"", without these songs I consider that it cannot said that it is the best of Prefab Sprout"
4,great product,"I bought this Silit Vision e30 while living in Korea. It was very expensive there. But the saleswoman at Shinsege department store told me I could cook foods without water, like cooking(baking) eggs, potatoes, pumpkins, even frozen steaks on cooktops and fast and also I could use it as a deep fryer. After fried some shrimps, small dent appeared, and two more after cooking steaks. I took it back to Shinsege. No warranty in Korea. I still give 4 stars because no dent(damages) appeared on the bottom of the pot again. I use it almost everyday. My husband loves juicy steaks. I enjoy using it more than Le Cruset or Staub. A Le Cuset saleswoman at Shinsege has tried to cook foods without water by using a Le Cruset pot, but failed. I am thinking about getting another one. The fried shrimps and veges taste good and less fatty, so stopped using my electric deep fryer. I've been using this pot for 2 years.Silit Vision e30 Cookware 2-1/2-Quart Low Casserole with Lid"
5,Best Submachine Gun for the money!,[...] I like my UTG MP5 because it is well made and very reliable. I like that it came with an extra magazine and hard stock kit. (my preference is the hard stock not the crane stock) I added a Barska 40mm Red dot scope. which will increase the COOL FACTOR by 100%. Check out my photo. Only one warning .. do not use the cheap freebie sling they throw in with the deal.. it is crap and the harness will break and cause your subby to fall in the dirt! Other than that... this gun rocks.. My other softAir are the KWC Berreta and the Classic Army M15 Tactical Carbine(costs more)But you can not beat the quality and fun factor of the UTG MP5 for this price!(...)
1,Cheap Product,"We ordered two units for our clients and within three days, they were returned to our office with a note of dissatisfaction. The two units were trashed and our design group will think twice before ordering these products agian."
1,Don't buy this one.,"This book was horrible. In spite of my enormous respect for books in general, I literally threw this one in the trash can after reading the first several chapters. Run for your life!"
1,This book attracts Terrible people,"The author of this book cleary has a ""I'm so much better than you"" type of attitude. That's the sort of thing that attracts a lot of negative people to this sort of mumbo-jumbo - people like me..."
5,Beware,"This is a very good DVD if you like the subject matter. However, please beware that this collection is a re-compilation of two sets still offered for sale on AMAZON. This set contains the 4 disks from ""Great Gardens of England - Gardener's View"" and the two disks of ""Gardens of the National Trust"". I returned this set since I already had the other two."
5,We all wear them in our shop!,"Work great! Everyone in our company has been given one to wear while plaining wood and when around the table saws. Cuts out a lot of the noise and I don't believe any of our Ear Muffs have broken and we do use them daily. A person can be standing right in front of you talking and if they aren't at a mild yell, you won't be able to make out what they are telling you."
3,Product good...just not for me.,"I've got a big head and this barely covers my ears. Whenever I turn my head, it also opens up so sound gets in. Not a big deal, as I used this just to mow the lawn. If I had to wear them all day, I'd go in another direction."
1,Over-rated and Over-priced,"I purchased these DeWalt DPG62C Interceptor Ear Muffs with an NRR29 rating for $64.03 plus tax and shipping. I was outraged to find them very poorly constructed at the point where the headband connects to ear muffs and in the headband covering. I also discovered these were severely overpriced by over $50.00! I then found many other brands (like ECHO for example) with NRR29 or better ratings and and far superior quality ear muffs for as little as $14.00, and without shipping or tax charges to boot. I promptly returned these highly over-rated and outrageously expensive DeWalt's. Wow, what's in a name!"
4,Spectacular Horner classic,"I was a kid when this movie came out, and the music was one of the first soundtracks in my collection. I played it to death, wore it out, and just got the CD for Christmas, to my exultation.This is Horner at his best, and he manages to convey childlike wonder and awe with just a few notes. From the opening notes in ""Through the Window"" to the last sweeping orchestral magnificence of ""The Ascension,"" there's perfection. The final track, ""Theme from Cocoon,"" is worth the price of the CD, as you get a little of every theme, but the main theme is as heartwarming and glorious as your grandma's hug.I dropped one star for the Michael Sembello's ""Gravity,"" which would be fine on another CD, I suppose - but its inclusion on this one is like getting electric shock therapy in the middle of a relaxing massage. Otherwise, a well-loved classic. I'm happy to have it back in my collection."
2,"Shallow, and derivative","Interesting hearing the inspiration for Silvestri's ""Mac and Me,"" as well as several note-for-note precursors to ""Titanic."" It is not as much of a patchwork as I thought, and Horner manages to keep his 'references' to his three favorite composers: Khachaturian, Prokofiev, and himself. On the downside, the music has that unmistakably shallow JH sound. As one critic so aptly said, ""It has a top, a bottom, and nothing between."" Likewise, the ""Star Trek"" references are more than a bit much."
5,"a very pleased, trueful review","This is the best book I've seen on Irish Crochet Lace. The patterns and instructions are very easy to understand. The book was packaged right so the book wouldn't be damaged in route to my home, the book was in perfect condition. I will gladly buy from this person again. Thank you for your excellent service."
1,OUTDATED,"The supplies named in this book are no longer available, the stitch names are no longer used, and the instructions are woefully inadequate. It might be good in a collection on the history of lace, but is rotten as an instruction manual. Not even worth the low price."
5,very interesting,"It is a very interesting book for advanced knitters, very detailed explanations.Pictures are not that great, but you get some ideas. As for me it was a great deal."
2,to complicated for me,"I have to confess, I love crocheting, but altho the items in this booklet are beautiful the directions are time consuming and a bit more complicated than I like. I crochet for pleasure, im not a pro, so Im just not up to these patterns!"
1,Not for an amateur,"I have crocheted a long time and have done some Irish crochet. This book would be difficult for the average crocheter. I don't think the instructions are easy to understand, the photos are in black and white, very grainy and hard to see. An experienced crocheter would manage but there are better books out there. I do not recommend this."
5,Hats off to this mother and daughter,"I read this book out of shear curiosity to see if someone had finally written a book that can be used as a resource for young women coming of age. At last it is here! Not only is it full of very useful information for women of all ages, it portrays a deep, loving relationship between a mother and daughter in a lighthearted manner that makes it a true page turner. Every mother should give this to their daughter, that is, after reading it themselves."
5,Informational and Humorous,"I loved this book! I found both the comic element and the straight-forward style of the book endearing. As I continued to read, I was amazed by how much I was learning (and at my age). This is a great book for any women of all ages!"
2,This book is a gas.,"While it's clear that someone has put the wind in Robert Tilton's sails, he is often seeing somebody's house. The foul smell of contempt that many of these books often contain has been blown away by Tilton's own wind of fresh air. The problem with this opus, is that there is something not normal about the way Tilton achieved his success. It's as if he just erupted onto the scene. Chickyboshoto is what I have to say about this book. The only reason I rate it so highly, is that it is the perfect book for bathroom reading."
5,Motivational,"If you are looking for encouragement and need to know that God wants you to succeed, this book is for you. This book is for winners."
2,Not bad.....,...but the interface is a bit annoying--you can't simply watch all footage--you have to navigate a menu between each short segment (each segment featuring a different creature). From the makers of Around the Alps and 3D Hawai'i. Check out that evil Tapir! This requires the electronic 3D shutter glasses (field sequential 3D) for proper viewing.
1,not real 3d,"This is in side by side format,and does not work with any of the 3d options for viewing 3d on my Samsund 3d tv that will even convert regular tv into 3d tv. Do not buy this and expect 3d viewing capability."
5,WWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW,"It is so WOW!! I luv it, it holds more than ten games way more than two games and it is blue my favorite color!!!"
5,"5 Stars for it being a work of Stalin, 2 stars for the info.","First off this is not a book, rather pamphlet is more of a correct term. Quick read, nothing too complex. I bought this to read something by the moron or intellectual (whoever one perceives) Stalin. To sum this up: Marxism is based on that most people will act for their personal own economic interests. Wow, what a suprise!?! I read this more for the historical importance rather than being a Marxist/Communist follower. So it it very good to read the (translated) words of Stalin, other than this I assume you know about Marxism before you read this so it offers nothing new"
2,"Good Drill, Bad Chuck",The drill and charging system seem top notch. However the chuck used on this unit is of poor design. The teeth design simply can't be tightened enough to grip anything round effectively. I returned it before being able to provide any long term feedback.
3,Only for the diehards,"""Sinking Island"" and the ext version of ""Stand or Fall"" are currently available on the remaster of Shuttered Room, and the 'remix' of ""Red Skies"" is lame. Except for ""Venture Out"", the other B-sides are weak and it's pretty obvious why they werent albumed. There is, however, a song called ""Crystal Ice Dub"" which is featured on the flip side of my ""One Thing..."" 12 inch, then called ""Reach the Beach (dub)"", which made this little album worthwhile to me as a longtime fan, as I have always enjoyed that so-called 'studio doodle'. Unless youre looking for something specific here, then just skip it."
4,The stuff you just don't have yet,"This is a compilation of songs that, for the most part, you wont have in your collection yet. Outside of ""Stand or Fall"" and ""Red Skies"" (the inclusion of which drop this from 5 to 4 stars) you probably do not have a version of the songs on this disc. ""Sinking Island"" is fantastic with its added horns. ""Crystal Ice Dub"" is my favorite on the album. It is a show of different textures that this band can create even without the lyric strains. Exceptional album for those who would like a little something different from a distinct known quantity of a band. Get your copy soon."
5,"""Comin' Out Hard""","This album may only have 8 tracks, but it's def. worth the $$$. Ball & G are 2 of the South's best...and they prove it on this album. These guys were talkin bout ""P-I-M-P"" a decade before that clown 50 Cent. Know the Roots of Southern Hip Hop, Pick up ""Comin Out Hard"". Fav Tracks: ""Pimps"", ""Mr. Big"", ""Comin' Out Hard""."
5,pimps,"pimps was tight love that old school sample ball and mjg tell the pimp game like it is you ain't think brothers down in memphis was doing things like that this was classic underground rap dirty south style paved the way for 36 mafia, no limit, and cash money. man get this has mr. big on here too this mug be jamming."
1,Kikkoman Plum Sauce,"We bought this Kikkoman Plum Sauce from our Grocery Store. It was for a hung roasted whole duck from the local Asian Market. This duck was as good as Duck I've had in Hong Kong. We made our own pancakes/crepes Hong Kong style. We cut Fresh green spring onions.We tasted this sauce before ruining our duck. The sauce was absolutely the worst. Bad flavor, bad smell. Not real Plum Sauce, it's mostly bad Soy Sauce. We returned it. Bad stuff."
1,Sounds nothing like the old fashioned Chuck Wagon Gang,"I can't believe these people are calling themselves the Chuck Wagon Gang. The sound is no where close to the original group. I am very disappointed in the ""new group"". The old Chuck Wagon Gang was all family, and you can't beat family blend. This group are all strangers each from very different musical backgrounds and don't sound like the original Chuck Wagon Gang. There have been groups in the past that had that same family sound. This is definitely not one of them."
5,A Great Gospel Tradition Continues,"This Chuck Wagon Gang carries on the great Gospel Music tradition started by D. P. Carter and his children in the 30s. Shaye Truax, now the alto for the group and the granddaughter of Anna Carter Gordon is blessed with a voice as good as her grandmother's. Melissa Cavness Kemper is as good as any soprano the group has ever had. Every song on this recording is an inspiration and blessing to listen to, but 'Don't You Weep For Me"" is my favorite. Any fan of the Chuck Wagon Gang will love this recording."
2,Not enough Popeye!,"The movie itself only plays the first two episodes then automatically goes back to the main menu. For you to watch all of the episodes, you have to fast forward once it gets to the end of the 2nd episode. Then, there are only a handful of Popeye cartoons, I believe there is more Superman than just about anything on this DVD. But for only a few bucks, I do like all of the classic selections the DVD has."
3,A Lion In Winter,"This CD lacks the feel-good, party-time atmosphere of the rest of Muddy's Blue Sky period. According to Bob Margolin's liner notes, the somber atmosphere of these recordings were due to a discontent between Muddy and the band over money. Some of the tracks are actually outtakes from 1977 sessions to complete the album. The band quit, and Muddy carried on performing live until his death in 1983.The two outtakes are excellent additions and worth upgrading this CD in your collection. But if you'd rather listen to a blues band having a great time in the studio, buy Hard Again or I'm Ready instead. They are both a better listen than King Bee."
1,Disappointed,"I had back pain and a tennis elbow. For my back pain the magnetic set was just ok but for my tennis elbow it wasn't good at all, it didn't help. Very disappointed!"
1,Hearts of Iron big dissapointment for Mac gammer,I've been waiting for a game like this ever since Panzer general so when I saw Hearts of Iron at the store today I bought it.After spending an hour learning to play from the tutorial I decided to play the 1936 starter level. There was only one problem. It didn't show up on the list of options.The 1939 level was there but far to hard to play without completing the 1936 level.This was the most agregious but by far not the only bug I encountered.If you make a mistake in the tutorial you can't go back a step. You have to start from the begining. The options don't take from the start game menu. You have to reinitialize them after you start ther game. Many more bugs.Any Mac gamers out there should refrain from buying this game till VP Games gets their act together.In reading other reviews I found out that the PC version was released with a lot of bugs. Apparently the Mac version was too.I'm taking it back to the store tomorrow. Buyer BEWARE!!!!!!!
3,Eh???,"Cute and quirky, lovely idea to help you solve your impasse's. Match the problem in your life with one of the twelve energies or archetypes, figure out whether you need to be moving away, towards, being in or creating that energy in your life, and listen to the two minute sound track that corresponds, whilst reading the message that corresponds.I think this would work well with a partner who would act as a counsellor and maybe help you to define the parts of the written passage that stuck in your consciousness as they relate to your problem. This is what Lynne has demonstrated in her book when working as a pair.But by yourself, you may just get the ""Eh???"" response that I did. Quirky music, nice thoughtful written words, but my ""inner knowledge"" needs a bit more prompting. Lets face it, some of us are as intuitive as a bar of soap."
4,Past recordings help with inference,I have never heard this album. I like all of his other endeavors. He is/was vastly talented and blends what I love the most about keltic music. He mixes the traditional with a driving beat and adds a pinch of crazy. He went so many directions. I would love to have everything he has done. I will miss him and his stay was too brief. I hope a copy comes available soon.
1,The real secret: too many pictures from the family album,"When I pay $40 for a graphic design book, I want more professional illustrations and fewer snapshots. The author, under the influence of deadlines or laziness, appears to have raided the family album for many photos. The many examples of what Photoshop filters can do are gratuitous filler. We've never seen those before, huh? Ditto for the usual suspects on the CD, demoware of programs available from many other sources. The publisher has tacked an extra $10 on the price of the book for a CD that cost $1, a shameful practice that is all too common in the book business. This book is a compelling reason why publishers don't give refunds. It's also a good reason not to join a book club, where I bought this book sight unseen."
5,This was a gift,"My mom loves Curious George series! I bought this DVD for her for Christmas, she loves it! I also bought 2 other Curious George DVDs."
5,We love Curious George,This video is great- I think there are about 10 episodes- definately plenty for long car trips. These episodes are taken from PBS and are the ones currently running. They are very high quality shows and don't bore the adults to tears on the 30th viewing like many children's shows & movies do. Another plus- none of the singing and dancing that is all too common in children's programming!
5,curious george,"I purchased this for my granddaughter who lives across country in WA. It was delivered promptly and according to Mommy and Daddy, she really loves it. Thanks Amazon!!!!!"
5,george,I brought this dvd for my daughter for her birthday and she just love's it cause she is just like george always getting into stuff being curious.
2,Don't get too excited... Geez,"As cool as this ""new dvd technology"" is, its nothing to jump up and down about. I've seen better animation on Saturday morning cartoons and the story is kind of lame. I found myself impatiently waiting for the characters to spit out dialogue and the combat left much to be desired.If you want to roleplay with characters on a screen, buy Baldur's Gate or NeverWinter for your PC. If you want to watch a fantasy movie, pick up Conan. This combination doesn't work.For me, I'll stick with tabletop roleplaying."
4,Great previews,"I just watched the preview DVD found in Wizard magazine (which is also in Dragon Mag) and thought it was pretty cool to be given the choice of where they will go and what they'll do next. It only allowed up to 4 choices but it's all I needed to buy the full DVD. When you choose a way that sets you apart from all the other characters, it ends the movie..BUT...it moves you back to the last choice you made so you can see what would have happened if you'd made a different choice. Then you can continue on from there.Can anyone say ""God complex""? hahaThe bad side is...You can't fast fwd or jump to the next scene. For instance: You have watched the whole movie and now you want to start over and make some different choices and see an alternate ending. You've seen the whole beginning and want to jump to the next choice and get it moving along. Nope, nada, ain't gonna happen. So..sit back and watch the movie again.Remember...4 possible endings. Enjoy"
4,I LOST!?,Just got this and took the noble path...to my death!!Great time. Didn't expect much but this certainly engaged and entertained me.My boys will love it too.
2,Fair...,"This is a nice item to add to a collection of D&D; trinkets, but in NO WAY is good. It is lacking in story and acting. A lot of the scenes were pleasant, but I was never ""compelled"" by the story.I would only recommend this to a hard core collector or a funny break from your current game..."
4,"Excellent fun, they must make more","Scourge of Worlds, is a 'pick a path' interactive movie. Excellent computer animation coupled with reasonably decent writing make for a fun romp. With about 990 variations to the story with 4 different possible outcomes, it allows you to view the movie a few times and make different decisions to alter the flow of the story. This is the first of this kind of movie I have ever seen, but I certainly hope it is not the last. Although this will never replace sitting around the table, dice in hand, and creating your own story playing Dungeons and Dragons, it is a good way to spend an hour. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys the fantasy worlds of Dungeons and Dragons."
2,choose your own adventures,"Bizarre atempt at merging the Choose your own adventure style of books with an interactive DVD. The end result is mixed. With four possible endings you think you can really control the out come of the adventure, but in reality you can not. Death and dismemberment await you at all turns with an anti climatic ending.As for the CGI animation. It comes no where close to Beast Wars or The CGI GI-Joes. The animation is not fluid and tends to bind on the characters. If you can find it really cheap, buy it but after you watch it once this disk will collect dust on your shelf.No plot development, no character development, more interaction between monsters and enemies in Balder's Gate 2 or Ever Quest. I was disapointed to say the least.-David"
4,Scourge of Worlds,"The animation is kind of crappy, but all in all it is a fun little game. For DnD fans and fans of the old school choose your path books"
3,"It is amusing and fun if you are bored, and the animation is cool!","This is kind of cool, simple, but cool, and especially good if you are bored and have some time to kill! and the animation is pretty cool, it is fun enough to make it worth while. :)"
2,My seven year old didn't even like it.,"I bought this video (game) the moment I saw it because my son had been wanting to ""play"" D&D for about a year now, but the reading and comprehension level of the actual game is too advanced for him right now, and I thought this would be a good introduction to the basic concept. Way wrong. My son watched the video in his room with a confused look on his face, and said, ""Dad, I dont get it"". So, I decided I would sit down and show him how to ""play"", and after watching an adventure all the way through to the finish, we were both decided that this was a pretty BORING video to watch. The animation was ok, but the story was FAR from engaging, and the characters were, I don't know how else to put it, dumb. (including the character YOU play). I would have had more fun reading him a book ,(which is ultimately what we did), and like I saw another reviewer write, ""it's a good first attempt"", I would not recommend buying it. We will never get those 90 minutes back."
3,Ah the Possibilities...,"...that fail to deliver. Rent it before you buy it. I like the idea, but ultimately, Scourge of Worlds disappoints. On the box it advertises 990 different story combinations- which I'm sure is true, but when those 'different' options are: Do this, that, and that - option two you change the first thing, but not the second or the third it gets a little tedious.The story could use a little work - it's a predictable DnD story and offers only a passing insight into the characters on screen. But, if you're looking for a way to explain DnD to friends - it's a nice option. I hope they put out a sequel with the 'different' options being truly different storyline options and not means to the same ends."
1,Scourge of my DVD player,"Had this been one of the D&D; games I DM'd I'd have been lynched!! (or Shot myself) If you like mindless D&D;, Running incompitant and un-creative characters, and have no use for playing a set alignment, then this is the DVD for you. To succesfully complete the game your best bet is randomly pick your choices without any type of thought, or knowledge of race, class or alignment. (They all lead to the same finale anyway.) Wrap it all up by killing an old friend who saved your life! Yea, that was fun! Regardless of your efforts the villain will get away, I'm sure for a comback in Scourge of Worlds 2.On the bright side my 5 year old found it entertaining for about two hours."
1,Boring. Linear. Sucks big time.,"I'm a fairly easy guy to please (cinematographically speaking), and i've enjoyed certain movies most people regard as bad...(horror movies, b-movies, etc.) But i really regret having bought this DVD. It has a very, very, very bad, and extremely linear plot... It's extremely boring. The animation was decent, but not good. I really don't see myself watching this again and again. I own the Dungeons & Dragons movie DVD (another one i regret buying) and being the bad movie that it is, scourge of worlds is even worse... and that is saying a lot. And once again, i am a fairly easy guy to please, i've never walked out of a movie theater yet, but i'm sure i'd have walked out of this one. Even the way they animated the characters...Mialee is extremely different from the illustrations in the core rule books... The music was perverse, everything...there's not one thing you can save from this movie... Do yourself a favor, and spend your money on something else!"
5,A Treasure for Keeping,"I bought this book as a keeper because I was told it was a pretty extensive offering of the collection. Yes, it is that but it is also beautiful laid out and with just enough text for the interested.If you are looking for a book to educate you on the less seen objects of the collection this is the one to have. An excellent addition to a Buckingham Palace guide."
3,Royal Treasure w/ a fraction of Royal Jewels,"Bought this in Amazon on-line. I was mis-lead by the title "" Royal Treasures"" and the front cover Tiara picture and believed that it contained most of the royal ""jewelry"" treasures! It's indeed a book full of all kinds of royal treasures from paintings to sculptures, furnitures to jewels, only a very small fraction of the royal jewels. But it's still a good reference book with great detailed pictures."
3,They Should Have Thought This Out Carefully.....,"This would have been an all time collection, but they used the wrong versions and most of these are edited. Some of the songs are not that bad but the timing on each makes you wish you bought the full lenght albums. So far I have their first 2 cd's with this Greatest Hits one. But after all, they are still one of the best groups out...."
3,It's ok they could have put better song on it.,"It's to bad they never toured the U.S.A.Maybe it would have turned out better. It seems to me that they always wanted to be like the (JACKSONS), but they never made it.I'S ashame that they went that way (five star)have great voiceses but they try to hard to be what they are not.They should all become (MODELS) ESP the girls."
5,Still.......today my No1 pop group!!!!,This greatest hits album just proves what a class act 5 Star really were! Deniece Pearson was such a big role model in my life and I am proud to say that this album is too. I only wish they were around today for other children to listen and look up to. I will continue to do the dance routines to this CD (perfectly may I add!!) for years to come LONG LIVE FIVE STAR!!!
4,Good Book to start,"The author gives a good introduction to the different ethnic groups in the US today. Differences cultures and approaches are discussed however I found certain mistakes (basically for the Hispanic segment). He generalized most of the population,, maybe it wasnt his intention but it's true. However, it is a good book for newbies. It helps you in you already are in the real estate business dealing with emerging markets today. I recommend it."
1,wrong item shipped!,"Item that was shipped by Online Toys was not the item ordered. Brown spotted Frog was suppose to have a sound chip...when in fact it had a squeaker....big difference. Again, one more example of Online's customer care factor and providing items that the customer ordered. I won't be purchasing from them again and will also encourage my friends to shop elsewhere. Buyer be ware!Vo-Toys Brown Spotted Frog with Sound Chip Dog Toy"
2,Not what I expected,"I recently bought this and recieved it today in the mail. Their service was very fast, but the produst just wasn't what I had expected. It looks very faded and the fairy's aren't very cute at all. (The fairy's hands on the blanket look like a male body part.)I do not recomend this product, the pictures are wayyyyy cuter than it really is. (sorry)"
5,"FASCINATING, DISGUSTING, BUT ULTIMATELY HAS TO BE SEEN","A WONDERFUL DOCUMENTARY ABOUT ONE OF MANKIND'S DARKEST HOURS. IT WILL DISGUST YOU, FASCINATE YOU, FRIGHTEN YOU AND YOU WILL LEARN JUST HOW EVIL THE JAPANESE REALLY ARE.EVEN TODAY - ALL THESE YEARS LATER - THEY STILL REFUSE TO APOLOGISE FOR ANY OF THE ATROCITIES THEY COMMITTED BEFORE AND DURING WORLD WAR II. AND IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT IF THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN THEIR QUEST FOR WORLD DOMINATION, THEN WOULD HAVE COMMITTED THE SAME ATROCITIES AGAIN AND AFAIN - THROUGH EUROPE AND AMERICA!! A WONDERFUL DOCUMENTARY OF A DEPRAVED RACE!! WELL WORTH THE PRICE. 5 GOLD STARS!!"
1,"Important subject, BAD film","This topic is an important one that needs to be brought to light, particularly considering the Japanese cover-up of such horrific atrocities. However, this film was BAD. The quality of the editing is grainy, and the voice over continually repeats the same phrases, often for shock value. The photographs and content are shocking enough without hearing over and over again ""rape, torture, kill,"" in a monotone and unsympathetic voice.Some of the old footage is good, but the film itself seems slightly exploitative and poorly produced.Read the book. Don't waste your time on this film."
1,forget about it,I was not happy with this purchase.It may have some pictures and short film clips worth seeing but the presentation of it all is so tacky. Over doing it on the video and sound effects with pictures zooming in and out which viewing could give you a headache. When there was pictures of buildings in ruins you could hear dubbed in sounds of something burning like wood at a campfire which would overlap into the next part of the film. It was just poorly presented and made. Why is it so much more than other dvds? maybe the extra money should go to film school for these guys.
2,Rape of Nanking DVD,Shoddy filming with a touch of WWII propaganda. Film is gory but probably accurate. DVD substantiated by other sources.
1,NOT the actual movie,"So I bought this DVD on amazon and was very disappointed when I received it. This is NOT the movie people are talking about - the movie being shown in selected US theaters is ""Nanking"" and it's not out on dvd yet... I wish I had checked more carefully before buying this."
5,"Review of ""The Rape of Nanking""","I teach a class on the Chinese revolution, 1911-1949. One of the topics I cover is Japan's invasion of China in 1937, which includes the atrocities committed in Nanking in December 1937. If the saying, ""a picture is worth a thousand words is true,"" then it was not necessary for me to lecture on the event; all I needed to do was to show the video to my students. We were all numb after watching the video. It took a while for us to regain our composure before discussing this episode in China-Japan relations."
2,Where's The Video??,"This was very informative and gave some really graphic pictures, but overall I found it pretty dull with the same pictures over and over again. I thought that there would be actual video from back then but it was mostly made up of pictures. If you want just the info on this without the video then buy it otherwise skip this one!"
2,Hard to read and to apply,I'm a computer sciences engineer working on my phd thesis that is related with game thoery. I found the book difficult to read. Forget about following an entire chapter if you are weak on differential equations.
4,iPod wall charger,This product is great. I can charge my iPod anywhere now and I don't need my computer to do it.
5,Beautiful Rose Parade,"1996 Rose Parade, in its entirety, is interesting and lovely. All the floats and all the bands without the commercials."
4,high yield,"Dr. Charles is very candid regarding his opinions on various subjects. The book is well written but wordy at times. The organization is pretty good. The discussions are primarily based on his own clinical experience although there is mention of study results. I particularly liked many of the illustrations, which I have seen in chapters of other retina texts that Dr. Charles has co-authored. For those pursuing retina, this book is an excellent introductory text."
1,useless product,After washing I was unable to wear - had to throw away. So tight couldn't stand. Totally useless.
4,Warner's Soft Cup Bra,"This bra was a very good fit. I have not worn Warner's before, so I was pleasantly surprised!"
2,not too informative book on movies,felt the book didnt tell me anything I didnt know..jsut a few tid bits were found. maybe good for young movie fans.
4,Great Purchase for class.,"What's there to say? I needed this book for a class. I found a cheap copy online and I bought it. There was no problem, and I recieved it within a week. The product was great, and I'll probably buy it again."
4,It's a softball,"I'm not a big softball player, so maybe there are subtleties of softballs that I'm not aware of. This Franklin ball seems to be the standard weight and size, and it seems durable. We only use it for playing catch, so it might not do as well if it were used in real games."
2,If you like this music...,"Toto's score from Dune -- especially the brooding main titles -- is really the work of the great Dimitri Shostokovich (his Symphony #11), with a little of Khachaturian's Gayne Ballet Suite adagio thrown in, dumbed down of course, and developed with little imagination, and a lot of bombast. Nonetheless, I loved the movie."
5,Music straight from a dream...,"If Frank Herbert himself included a music track in his Dune books, it could not be any more fitting than this work by Toto. They have managed to capture all the mystery, passion, elegance and desert-hardened magnificence of the Dune saga in this one soundtrack. Herbert created the Dune universe. This soundtrack gives it sunset-rich color."
4,Different Tracks?,"I didn't give 5 stars, because I'm not sure about some things... there are different tracks on the 1993 soundtrack, this cd has 3 extra total tracks, but many different named tracks, so I don't really know if I should buy this or both... (I lost the other one). Why can't people be consistent, or at least keep ALL the tracks!"
4,Helen Myers Is Getting Much Better!,"I didn't care for ""Come Sundown"" at all, because of the excessive romance in it, but ""More Than You Know,"" on the other hand, has just a little romantic scenes here and there and A LOT OF MYSTERY. I liked the character quite a lot. The main character was investigating the mysterious death of her brother and she believes that one of the cops is involved. So she and her lover, another cop, are on the case. Between ""Come Sundown"" and this one, ""More Than You Know"" is better."
2,"Too stereotypical, with a slow-moving, uninteresting plot","The only thing saving this book from a one star is the hero, McKenna, who is so genuinely realistic, he doesn't belong in a very weak stereotypical book.The ""damsel-in-distress"" plot is getting very old. I wanted very much more emotion and vulnerability from McKenna. His situation with his daughter is the only thing that made this book worth reading. He was the only character that shook me emotionally, especially when he visits Houston, and what occurs.The plot was slow moving and predictable. It's not suspenseful, and the heroine isn't someone I particularly liked.I just wish more male characters like McKenna end up in better books, where there characters can fully blossom and be explored.As a final note, I believe most men who suffer a great loss are not sex-starved. They rather be held and comforted, not seduced in a shower."
4,Wild!,"These wild sessions, with more than twenty players on most cuts, are not nearly as chaotic as its sounds upon casual listening. The tracks range from the 40 minute ebb and flow of ""Huey Sees Light Through A Leaf"" to the beautiful, concise ""The Painter & The Poet,"" which clocks in at under six minutes.Little Huey consists of many movers & shakers in the ""downtown"" scene. (Roy Campbell-T, Cooper-Moore-P, Rob Brown, Assif Tsahar & Chris Jonas-Reeds, & Susie Ibarra-D) Greg Bendian really stands out on vibes throughout these pieces and Lisa Sokolov adds some wonderful vocals to three tracks.The only downside to this set: Parker only plays on three cuts! At least its two of the longest."
5,Great Reader,"Perfect self reader. The story line is engaging, young children love it. The images are beautifully done with lots of color and detail. The font is big enough and the story is not too long. I love this series of books. Highly recommended."
2,Not worth the money.,"While the storyline was acceptable, it should be made clear that the product is less than 15 minutes long. Not worth paying for, since it doesn't say anything new."
5,Contains most of the good stuff,"This Cd contains most of the good stuff from the 5 Stairsteps. The title cut (which is personally my all-time favorite song) is here as well as the simply breathtaking ""Danger She's a Stranger"" as well as the pseudo-gospel ""Didn't It Look So Easy."" Some other good 5S tunes like ""Behind Curtains"" aren't included here, but fortunately they're available on other 5S Cd's. Either way, a good intro to this group and quite pleasing for fans."
1,One Song missing,This Album is missing the song 'From Us To You'No Fivestairstep Cd is worth anything without that song.I really need that song.:(
5,This is the best one of the early albums,"This is really good. I like the Idea that they had a 2nd guitarist for this band and it sounds a lot better. lot of good songs. the only thing that kind of makes me mad is the fact that they use the N word on the Tina Turner song. I'm not racist. even though I like this band, I like them because they are British Punk. not this whole skinhead thing."
3,i have some doubts,"I read Ms. Howse book and with each chapter my doubt-o-meter kept going off. She says that you don't need to trim your hair but doesn't explain how the resulting split ends and shaggy appearance of your head will help your hair. She says that you can sleep on cotton pillows. Okay, maybe she can but when I do it I wake up with a tangled mess. She says wool caps don't harm your hair but everyone I know suffers breakage in the winter from their hats. The author is not a hair dresser and apparentely did not go to cosmetology school.There is good advice in this book but the previous things all make me doubt the worth of this book. Get Shamboosie's book or Andre Talks Hair instead."
2,Didn't Like it At ALL,"I disliked this book a lot. Perhaps I would have found the information beneficial ten years ago, but being that I am fairly knowledgeable about hair, I was not blinded by the (simplistic) info and saw through to her tone and diction, which were horrible! I was actually in shock reading some parts of the book because I can't believe her editor would have let it be published like that. Also, she kept talking about our hair ""as blacks,"" as if we are some kind of mutants with alien hair. It really rubbed me the wrong way. I prefer Chicoro's book or Thank God I'm Natural."
4,It really works,"After I have tried a wide variety of products and crazy ideas, I have found a product that actually works. I have read the book from front to back, and followed the steps. My hair has grown beautifully with time, patience, and the UBH Book. So, stop wasting money on bogus products and try this UBH conditioning treatment. You will be very thankful! I would like to congratulate the author of the book. Job well done!"
5,A must read,"I have read both Cathy Howse book and Shamboosie. Both I found to be very informative although quite contradictary in some areas. Overall, both are good read. I think every woman trying to achieve that long hair should read this book instead of weaving. I know tons of black people that will tell you not to wash your hair often because your hair needs those oils and dirt in your hair and scalp. There are a lot of old myths in the black community that cathy discredits and if people would just open there minds and try her techniques instead of holding on to same old same old such as don't wash your hair too often and the scalp must be greased daily and so forth and there can be a revolution regarding hair in the black community. For those of you still skeptical you have been trying to grow your hair this long and you have found the book because of that reason so why not try her techniques and use her advice. Just do what she says and I do believe it will work for you."
2,just okay,"I liked this book but I didn't like how she advertised her own products through withholding information. For example, she recommends a conditioner that stimulates but never talk about what other products can be used to ""stimulate."" Instead, she sells her conditioner as seemingly the only product on the market that does all of the things that a conditioner should do. That makes me distrustful especially because her other products contain ingredients that aren't so great for your hair. Good try . . . but I think the book Grow It was a lot more useful.Also, she straightens her hair way too much for someone who really wants to grow Black hair to its maximum length and health--whether through chemicals or heat."
2,informational,"The information in the book was somewhat helpful but I found that washing my hair every three days made my hair very dry and gave me dry scalp, not impressed."
4,fantastic,I enjoyed reading this book. It was very easy to read and the information was informative and easy to grasp and apply. I would definately recommend it for anyone considering going natural and to use as a part of your library
4,Interesting Supplement to Chicoro's Book,"I like the book. It gives information on how to strengthen the hair, esp. for women who want to keep their chemically processed hair. Women who plan to go natural without heat etc, it offers good tips the structure of the hair and on moisturizing daily."
1,Waste of Money,This book is poorly written; the useful information could have been summed up in 5 pages or less. There is paragraph after paragraph of repetitive information. I read the book in less than a half an hour and didn't gain much useful information. I think there are other books available with more useful information. I feel like I wasted my money.
1,Never Received this Book,"I have a copy of this book on my kindle. It's a great haircare book for black women with both natural and relaxed hair; however, when I ordered a hard copy from one of the amazon sellers for my niece...it never came but my card was charged. Wow!"
4,You Can't Argue With Common Sense!,"As the author ofThe Secret to Miracle Hair Growth For Ethnic HairI know a thing or two about growing black hair long. So I can tell you with some authority that Ultra Black Hair Growth has some solid, helpful information for growing black hair! In fact, this book paved the way for books like mine!So here's what the author does best: She gives you down home, common sense about hair growth! One of my favorite parts of the book is where she dispels the myth that trimming your hair increases and/or facilitates hair growth. Hair grows from the scalp- duh! Lol!If you follow the common sense tips in this book you have a solid, long term hair growth regimen that will give you the freedom to ditch the weaves, wigs and hair dressers once and for all!"
3,Not what I was expecting!,Since this book was published quite some time ago it did not offer incite into current hair products. I also would have preferred more examples as far as products are concerned.
4,It's working,Am trying to grow my hair back and have been following Cathy advice for the last 5 weeks now and have seen a big improvement in my hair already
2,disappointed,"Very disappointed in this book. I was expecting a guide full of solutions and assistance to taking care of my relaxed hair. All I got was a lot of talk about myths and to keep reading and later I would get all the answers to my questions. When I finally got to answers there were not many. I also did not trust a majority of things mentioned in the book; for example, it is not necessary to clip your ends it just makes your hair look good, but not necessary. I disagree. It is very important to clip your ends to prevent snagging, eliminate split ends and breakage. The book is full of a lot of talk, just get to the point.I would recommend-Beautiful Black Hair: Real Solutions to Real Problems--A Step by Step Instructional Guide."
3,Not completely satisfied with this book,"Like everyone else who purchased this book, I want to know how to get my hair to grow long. This book didn't really tell me anthing that most people don't already know. The author spent the first few chapters complaining about other critics negative comments. Now did I really need to pay for that? Of course not. Most people know to keep their hair moisturized regularly as needed. I also notice that she is really pushing the use of her products. But I will follow her regime for a month, and see what happens."
3,Helpful information,"I thought the book had some good ""common sense"" advice about healthy haircare. I plan to use many of the tips. I wish, however, that Cathy had made it clear up front that her book is not really intended for those of us who have ""Natural, un-processed , un-relaxed"" hair. Her best advice to (us) is ""get a perm or relaxer and she'll tell us how to take care of it."" She could have made it clear sooner. Then I would have made a more informed decision about purchasing the book.I do, however plan to heed her advice and will probably purchase the ""conditioner"" from her product line. It sounds like a really good product. I like the idea of stimulating the scalp for hair growth.I learned a lot about hair. This is a good, sensible book and I probably would have purchased it anyway. I simply wish I had known up-front that it is not really intended for those of us with natural hair. I liked the book. I have no regrets about purchasing it and I thank Cathy for the info."
3,Handy,"The information in the book was undoubtfully handy. I learned things that I never knew about hair and I was able to incorporate her tips into my own hair care regime.My only disappointment however is that she seems pretty darn fixated with selling her hair products (even more-so in her website).With a lot of research I had done on natural ingrdients (ingredients you may have in your house), I realised that I can use her tips without having to spend the costs on her products OR ANY brandname product. I even managed to improve the tips she gives (with research). Online research goes a long way. But I'm still glad that I bought the book. Before, I didn't have a stable hair regimin and I did things pretty randomly. Now I have system of washing, conditioning...etc.My hair has never felt better. (not weighed down, bouncier, VERY moisterized)"
4,Good Book,"This book provided a lot of information that is needed for those with kinky hair. I found the information to be true as I am currently trying the suggestions in the book. Thanks for providing us with the truth about our hair and how to grow it long and beautiful. I wish everyone with ""our"" type hair would read this book."
3,VERY redundant,"[...]Well, this book is an easy read. It is very repetitive. She does tend to rant and rave about others. Truly, this could have been a little pamphlet. To sum up her book - you need to wash your hair at least every 3 days, keep it moisturized, and take vitamins (because your hair and nails get the leftovers). And - of course - trimming does not grow your hair,If you want some serious HEALTHY hair growth, check out this ongoing publication that is FREE (and works - I have 3/4 in. of new growth in 4 weeks). [...]"
3,Based on read reviews,I have not bought this book but from reading all these reviews it looks like if you use the internet a lot you will find 80% of whatever tips she has and may not need to purchase the book. I praise her though for coming up with a book of something that works for black hair;working for lots of peopleI will buy a used one to keep in my library or pass on to someone too busy for the internet.*Her website response to questions are rather harsh and her answers were mostly recommending her products
3,Decent Advice for the Price,"I think the advice in this book was decent. However, there were no new secrets to doing my hair. I didn't waste a lot of money on the book, but if you condition your hair, don't cut it as much and keep hair dryers and hot curling irons off of it, it will grow. It's all common sense."
4,Learned alot,"This is a great book. I love the tips on a common sense approach to caring for Black hair. I do agree that the book is geared towards women who prefer to keep their hair relaxed. However, there are alot of tips that apply to all. I tried the receipe for Ms. Howse's hair conditioner and absolutely love it. I will probably order a few more of her products just to try them."
4,Good Starting Point,I thought this book was a great starting point for understanding any type of hair care.
2,Nothing You did not already know!!!,"Tis book only had basic haircare tips that are basic knwledge. If you have no clue for haircare, buy it. If you have common sense don't buy it! It was waste of my money."
2,"Ultra Hair Growth ...please, there's much easier and 'softer' ways to grow hair!","I bought the book, the products and was filled with false hope! I used it for more than a few months and it more than broke my hair and made it feel like straw! At the time my hair was just at my ears. Stopped it after 8 months and headed to a hair salon to rescue my hair (had to get it cut!!)! Low and behold, was watching a program on MTV one day and some girls with beautiful long hair were talking about Ultra Hair plus tablets and Hair Factors tablets. Eventhough they were Caucasian, decided to try it out! 6 months later, my hair is now way below my shoulders and still growing! My hair looks beautiful and I would say that every black woman should at least use Ultra Hair plus! I'm not a sales person, but I am someone who wants long luscious Afro hair! I've got hold of the secret now!"
3,Ultra Black Hair Growth II,"I've read the Ultra Black Hair Growth II. Although the main idea is to keep the hair moisterized, one must keep in mind that no two women's hair are alike. Consideration should be taken as to one's health, genetic background and environment. Since moisterizing cremes/lotions main ingredient are water and mineral oil it is not efficient when using electric or croquinole curling irons on Afro-American's hair."
2,Not what I expected...,"If you are new to taking care of your own hair I guess this book can be quite helpful. But if you've been actively seeking out hair information for the past 5+ years as I have then this book isn't going to tell you anything new. To sum it up: Wash your hair at least once a week, pay attention to the pH of your hair products, don't grease your scalp, deep condition under a dryer for 15-20min once a week, eat healthier and drink lots of water, use heat appliances as little as possible, be gentle with your hair."
4,"AT LAST-ANSWERS, SOLUTIONS & RESULTS: THIS REALLY WORKED..FINALLY.","AFTER YEARS OF WONDERING HOW TO MAKE MY HAIR GROW LONG, WHY IT WOULD SHED EVERYWHERE, WHY IT APPEARED NOT TO GROW AT ALL AND $$$$$$$$$ ON PRODUCTS, I FOUND THIS BOOK. I BEGAN FOLLOWING HER INSTRUCTIONS TO A ""T"" IN 12/06 AND MY HAIR HAS GROWN 6"" JUST LIKE SHE SAID IT WOULD AND IT'S STILL GROWING! I CAN'T DESCRIBE THE FEELING OF HAVING LONG HAIR, IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE. BEG , STEAL OR BORROW TO GET THIS BOOK MY BLACK QUEEN SISTAS SO YOU TOO CAN ENJOY YOUR CROWNING GLORY!"
1,Save your money!,"Basically, Cathy emphasizes the importance of not brushing relaxed hair, staying away from heated appliances, moisturizing your hair daily, washing your hair every three days and using her hair products. The book is poorly written and filled with several grammatical errors. I foolishly purchased her hair products and got terrible results. Save your money."
3,Good info,This book is an easy read yet know new information. Everything that is written in the book you could possibly google. Also I found that the author is very redundant often saying the same thing over again. The book is not worth the money but is informative.
1,Don't waste your money!,"In short...She says: wash your hair, condition it, and don't brush it. That's common sense. The rest of the book is spent bashing other people in poor grammar and misspelled words. I'm glad she has growing hair to her credit!"
4,Good info.,I really enjoyed reading this book and finished in one day. I have since referred to the book many times as I am currently using her system. I hope I see results soon!
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ultra Hair Growth II was probably one of the worst books I have ever read. It was poorly written, there were grammatical errors, and the information was very limited. I found that the author spent most of her time boasting about research that she had done to write the book, however after reading it, there was little evidence that such research had been conducted. I felt just as ill-informed about the subject of black hair care after reading Ultra Hair Growth II as I did before I read it.It was just terrible! I would not recommend this book to anyone, in fact, it is my recommendation that it be removed from the shelves, it does nothing to educate the reader on the subject it attempts to address, AND (this may be just me) but the author gets way too colloquial with her readers, I dare say even presumptuous. Just because I am black doesn't mean that I am ghetto. By far the biggest waste of money I have spent on a book...EVER!"
2,I didn't really like it,My reason for not liking is it is made primed women hair and not for natural women hair. I recommend it for women with chemical treated hair.
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"This book was okay. I don't have any drastic results to report yet, but I do like the way my hair feels. Cathy Howse states in the book that it's about common sense.And that's what you have to use when you read it. So in my opinion, this book is best used as a reference book and not a bible. Some of the things just wouldn't work for me. But over all, it gives you a good idea of how to start taking better care of your hair."
2,"Common Sense, but mildly interesting","This book is just common sense. It takes about 20 minutes to read through the whole thing, but you can get comprable information from any website about hair care. Almost half of it is just the author disputing other people's claims. Would not reccommend purchasing it unless you really don't know anything about your hair.."
3,Ultra Black Hair,This book concentrated on relaxed hair. I am a newly natural and was surprised that a number of chapter was about relaxed hair. I will give it to someone with relaxed hair. Although the ph tips were great.
2,Forgetting someone?,I wonder...here's a well renowned archeologist who spent quite a number of years in Turkey and didn't find anything Armenian?No further comment.
4,Ancient Turkey: A traveller's history,Very detailed summary of human activity in Anatolia since the Stone Age. Written by a British archeologist whose specialty is Mesopotamia and Anatolia. The accompanying maps could be better or at least better indexed.
2,Not worth the purchase unless you really ejoy affirmations,"I really think this information should have been included in one of Riso and Hudson's other books...For example it would have fit well into ""The Wisdom Of The Enneagram: The complete guide to psychological and spiritual growth for th nine personality types.""I think that an individual who is already aquainted with the enneagram and who strongly benefits from the use of affirmations can get something out of this book...But otherwise I don't feel its worth the purchase."
3,Not a bad little book but not really my approach,"This is a nice little book of affirmations to help one overcome one's enneagram compulsion. I know people who use it, and have even recorded the affirmations in their own voices to begin or to end their day. I like to go over it, however, this approach does not work for me personally. I highly reccommend it to anyone who listens to tapes, likes to repeat and has time for this. It's not for everyone, but for those who benefit from affirmations it will be a constant companion."
4,A good guide to your own internal dialog,"I've had this book for years and have found it very useful. I'm not generally fond of the 'self-affirmations' approach to self help. But, the affirmations suggested here are truly on-target for your own enneagram type. A nice bedside table book. Read one page and you will take with you deep thoughts for a day."
3,Good introductory step,"If the Enneagram and its application is new to you, this might be helpful or if you just do well with simple reminders of the path."
3,Quietly powerful,Very short book. Maybe this is a case of less being more?The affirmations & releases definitely hit home and have left me with the inspiration to learn to chant or meditate on these phrases.
3,Handy Reference,"This is a handy, and quick, reference for identifying the greatest challenges of each Ennea Type, as well as the opposite positive qualities that each type can express. There are no givens in personal growth; too many people remain emotionally immature when they cross out of this life, but for those capable of insight, understanding, and growth this little book is helpful for understanding where we, our friends, and family need compassion--as well as a kick in the proverbial a--.I have most of Riso's books and I like this convenient book. But there is more to growth than just knowing the levels of health and disintegration within a type. In conjunction with the Enneagram, I recommend Robert Moore's King, Warrior, Lover, Magician on the Jungian archetypes. They are like an umbrella over each of the Ennea types."
5,"A comprehensive, ""must have"" reference","Magee's text is the most comprehensive, practical text covering diagnosis and evaluation of orthopedics I've found. I recommend it without reservation to anyone involved in neuro-musculo-skeletal examination and diagnosis, including athletic trainers, sports medicine specialists, primary care physicians, physiatrists, and physical therapists.OPA is organized to include applied anatomy, patient history, detailed examination techniques (including all the eponymous tests), diagnostic imaging, and case studies for each joint of the body. Also included are chapters on Gait, Posture, Emergency Sports Assessment, and Preparticipation Examination.From a physician's viewpoint, the text lacks only a discussion of therapeutic approaches. However, these hinge fundamentally on the physical diagnosis and lie more in the realm of physical therapists."
2,One major complaint,"Well written, but I've got the fifth edition and there is one serious flaw that really frustrates me and shows a serious error in logic: If you go to the end of the chapter to check a reference, all that you will find is a note stating ""To enhance this text and add value for the reader, all references have been incorporated into a CD-ROM provided with this text"".How exactly is that adding value? I have to go try and fish out some CD, attach the CD player to my laptop and try to navigate around until I find the reference list for that particular chapter?How about just adding two pages at the end of each chapter with the reference lists? This is a serious flaw and shows an error in judgment, especially for those who like to actually check the references cited within the text."
