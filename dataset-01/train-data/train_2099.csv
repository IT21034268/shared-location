1,Just Not There,"I had heard this collection was a less bombastic, less produced Barbra Streisand album....Sadly, its not...I don't listen to this type of music anymore--I was hoping for something more raw and real.I just don't feel Barbra's music anyomore"
3,Less than what I expected,"When I heard about a Streisand's standards album I thought: Well finally she's releasing something that could be really good. Now I have it I'm a bit disappointed. The album is overeproduced, she sounds good but it is obvious that her voice has lost the power it used to have...Of course she still has the vocal technique but it is not enough. For moments she sings so slowly trying to show she still able to sing, that some songs turn into a real bore thing (she almost kill ""Calling"")."
1,Streisand's nadir,"Simply the worst Streisand has ever sounded. And the production is equally uninspired. This is the album that has people talking about the vocal decline of Streisand (Although the delightful ""Guilty Pleasures"" shows us that her voice is still a thing of beauty). The choices of songs range from inspired to tired, but there is so little life in the performances. And if we never hear her sing another sappy tune by the Bergmans, that would do just fine. The finale, a ""Don't Rain on My Parade"" type of showstopper, is painful to listen to. In my opinion, Barbra Streisand needs to stop producing her own records and let someone with fresh ideas and a fresh approach reignite her."
3,Reminsicent of her 60's standards lp's,"Streisand is showing a lot of maturity here, I'm not a big fan, i mean I think her 1st several lp's of standards from the 60's were fine, back when she sang sonsg like ""my Funny Valentine"" and was taking singing lesson from Anita O'Day. however she really surpised me here and I even find this cd enjoyable, the arrangements ar etimeless and the voice is pretty and youthful, and technically Stresisand is SO GIFTED!!! However she is emotionally unable to let go, and be herself, she doesn't feel anything she sings. She has admitted many times that she sings only for the money and not for enjoyment and taht comes thru in her albums, however I like this cd, and can safely recomend it to pople who don't like Steisand, this is a hard set to resist and she actually brings ou the beauty of these songs with ehr vocie. S ogo ahead and buy this weather you are or aren;t a fan. Her best work in the last 3 decaeds!!!"
5,Barbra Remains the Best,"""The Movie Album"" proves--again--just how relevant Barbra Streisand is, 40 years after her first album. No other artist, male or female, can match her amazing voice, her excellent choice of songs, and her longevity.""Smile"" is one of the best songs I've heard Streisand sing, and the bossa-nova spin on ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" suits the song perfectly, almost like it was intended to have that sound for decades. ""The Second Time Around"" is pure, vintage Streisand--it sounds like it could have been on ""Simply Streisand,"" and her voice is just as pure as it was in 1967.The CD ends with a show-stopper, ""You're Gonna Hear From Me."" And I'm glad I did hear from her. The album is brilliant and gets better with every listening. Hopefully Barbra will make room on her shelves for more Grammys!"
4,brilliant cd by the best of the best,"This is an extraordinary cd. Barbra Streisand is the best of the best and here she proves it again. First the selection of material is amazing. These are not your everyday movie songs and her performace of the material is incredibly pure. If this artist has sometimes tended toward making recordings that are not focused even if her singing was thrilling this is the rare exception. Songs like WILD IS THE WIND, HOW DO YOU KEEP THE MUSIC PLAYING, GOODYE FOR NOW, and YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM ME give us a mature Barbra Streisand in excellent voice performing music that matters to her. This may not be the cd fans were expecting but it reinforces the artistry of this brilliant actress who sings. Once again I say brava."
5,"""The Way Only Streisand Can Do Them""","Like her ""Broadway Albums"" this record is a concept masterpiece featuring songs not from the Broadway stage, but from film. Many may not know the dozen songs featured here, but they definitely have new life thanks to Barbra's impeccable vocals and production values. The only two tracks I knew were ""Moon River"" from ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""How Do You Keep The Music Playing?"" from the film ""Best friends"".Other songs here that I simply adore are ""Calling You"", ""But Beautiful"" and ""I'm In The Mood For Love"".""The Movie Album"" sold extremely well going as far as #5 on the Billboard Pop Album Charts and going Gold selling over 500,000."
1,Wonderful,What can you say about this woman's talent? Got two for gifts and they were hits. You just cannot go wrong giving this as a gift to any of her fans.
4,Movie Album,"This latest CD is probably geared toward true, diehard Streisand fans (most of whom will love anything she records). The quality of her voice and the orchestration is phenomenal- crisp, clear and melodic. The CD is worth buying alone for the rendition of ""Calling You""- a beautiful and very haunting rendition, as well as ""Moon River"", ""Smile"" & ""How Do You Keep the Music Playing"". The only disappointments were some vague, unknown selections such as ""Emily"", and ""Goodbye for Now"" (the theme from Reds). Again I should emphasize that it's not Streisand's voice with these selections, but the song material itself. Many fans would have appreciated other better known standards."
2,Where's The Passion?,"Barbra Streisand always gave me goosebumps -- but for the life of me, this CD leaves me totally cold. The only song that comes close to the old passion is ""You're Going to Hear from Me"" -- but it still did nothing for me. I am wondering if her marriage to Mr. Brolin has helped Ms. Streisand feel safer, so that the ""hunger"" I used to hear in her voice is no longer there? The choice of songs was only fair and many interpretations strayed a bit too far from the original tune taking too many liberties with it. I find this problem in many of her recordings and wish she would just stay more on-track. Great song writers don't need anyone's ""help"". Disappointing."
3,"She sounds very nice, but too many ballads","So you can calibrate me, I would rate her Broadway albums as 5 stars and her recent wedding album as 1 star. Barbra still is very enjoyable for me, and each song listened to separately would not be bad, but listening as a whole album, the lack of difference between the song styles rates the album down for me. Unlike some other reviews, the clear winner for me on this album is the Calling. Really like that one. She needed more tracks like the closing song. This is her real style.This album reminds me of the Neil Diamond movie album. I am a big fan of his also, but he made every song a ballad."
1,No more Streisand please,"I ordered this cd from USA as I wanted the limited edition being a big fan of Barbra Streisand. However,less than a week after receiving it, I have given it away at a huge discount to a friend. This is the only Streisand CD that I have taken pains to order and then dispose of. What is wrong with this recording? There is no fire, no life. I don't like the obscure songs and cannot believe that Barbra could not find better songs than the ones she has chosen. It is indeed a big disappointment but the sad thing is that this recording now affects my opinion of her as an artist. I used to think she was the best and that no one could touch her. I scoffed at Celine fans, Michael Jackson fans, etc saying they had no taste unlike me who listens to Barbra Streisand. Now I guess I will be giving the other singers a chance and won't be prejudiced anymore."
1,Big disappointment,I am a fan of Barbra Streisand. I could not believe how bad and overproduced this album sounds. Her voice is amplified and processed. The choices of songs were ok but the spirit in which they are rendered leave so very much to be desired. The general tempo is slow and plodding. The album is tedious and the bonus dvd is pathetic! I would expect any DVD produced would have dolby digital sound at the least! ALL close head shots of Barbra holding the headphones with her exquisitely manicured hands. YUCK! This is the worst CD I purchased in 2003.
1,Too slow and boring,"I felt this album was too slow and dull. It's tedious to listen too in spite of her ""good"" voice. ... I'm a so so babs fan but really thought this album was weak. Weak arrangements especially on Wild is the Wind and How Do You Keep the Music Playing. I just thought her voice sounded the same on every song. The album lacks too much humanism for me to feel it deserves anymore than one star.e, although I know the record will sell very well, and her singing ""live"" on ""Oprah"" will help. Her rendition of ""Smile"" alone is worth the price of the CD. What will we do when she stops making music? I think people will appreciate her even more after her death. There is no one on earth like her. She turns songs into prayers."
2,Boring,"I am a longtime fan of Ms. Streisand, but the only word that comes to mind to describe this CD is boring. All the songs sound virtually alike. By the time I had listened to the entire CD, I had already decided to put it away. Unless you are a die-hard fan, don't waste your money on this one."
5,Great music to vote to,"I enjoyed this album during my long wait in line to vote. It really motivated me to tough it out as the line seemed to inch forward and my legs began to ache. But the climax came while listening to Babs belt out those notes as I eagerly got my chance to vote for GEORGE W BUSH. For a good laugh, I'd also recommend the movie F 9/11.Cheers,Fidel"
2,B is for Bland,"I never thought I'd call Barbra boring, but this CD comes pretty close. Elevator Music. Poor choices (Emily? 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse?) Bland arrangements. Everything is Soooooo Slow and Serious. Where's the fun? The joy? The Passion? Its not here, that's for sure. On the first cut, Smile, I was encouraged, but after a few more cuts, everything started sounding the same. Its hard to keep awake. Even Sondheim comes up lacking. Of course, the Bergmans are well represented here too. (Yuck) On the last cut, You're Gonna Here From Me, I thought Barbra was finally going to cut loose and belt one, but even this song was disappointing. She doesnt create any fire till the very end. A major disapointment. I've played this CD twice and I doubt will listen to it again. Apparently others feel the same as its rapidly falling off the charts. I hope the 2nd installment is better, but I'm not sure at this point, I'll risk buying it. Too bad."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Never expected such a lackluster effort from Barbra. Tired, weak and boring!! Everything sounds the same -- and none is worth listening to!"
1,lacks compassion,I found the album to lack compassion and emotion. She with so little enthusiasm as if she really didn't want to show up at the recording studio that day. I think she's just given up but figured there are still enough loyal fans out there that will buy anything that she couldn't resist separating the fools from there money. Good one Babs.
1,Not a strong effort,"I agree with most of the reviews here that call this a very weak effort. I don't know what happened to this artist. I hope this album is not a reflection on future works we will see from her. It is a real shame that this album didn't have ANY of her qualities that I've so admired in the past. It's just not there in this case. I think most people who are honest, will agree that this album is pretty bland. Therefore, I think it only deserves one star."
2,Boring,"I'm a Streisand fan from way back, but I don't like this CD at all. I listened to it once and may not ever listen to it again. All the songs seemed to blend together into a boring and bland listening experience. Yes, individual songs were lovely and she still sounds fabulous, but I don't understand why she selected some of these songs. Her Broadway album was SO much better!"
3,Good quality - but small,"The quality looks great for this cookie sheet - very sturdy and appears to have a good non-stick surface. I can't comment on its performance because I haven't used it. It's quite a bit smaller than a ""standard"" cookie sheet so I think I'm going to return it. It is 12"" X 13"". Our old cookie sheet is 14"" X 16"". If size isn't important, then I'd recommend it. Also, the cookie cutters are metal (not a big deal but they looked different in the picture)."
5,Tremendous Introduction To The Field ...,"For the numerically inclined, this is one of the best introductory texts I have ever digested. This book is an essential tool for all who practice the art of analysis and are uninitiated with the fundamentals of econometrics."
2,Disapointed,"Where is the application??The author uses very little, if any, examples of applying econometrics to financial topics. The book is strewn with Larry Bird free-throw stats and SAT scores, height weight distributions and skiing training! I was expecting daily returns on the S&P; 500.I'm giving 2 stars because the CD included has some useful things, although the VB code is very amateurish."
1,Introductory Econometrics,"Introductory Econometrics: Using Monte Carlo Simulation with Microsoft ExcelThis book is a waste of time and money. It is basically a book on statistics. Verbose but not much teaching. 90% of it I (as well as most people who have studied basic statistics) already know and do not need it. The other 10% I don't know, it does not teach me except by giving me a few button to press."
2,It's actually not that great,There is a problem with the weight distribution of the vac and although it cleans well it does not suck the water back up well and leaves the carpet wet for 3 to 4 days.
1,Horrible!,"My understanding is that this fragrance is no longer manufactured. This is not what I thought to be the last bottle in town lucky find. What's inside the bottle is bogus. It doesn't even smell like the original fragrance gone stale. Stay away and save your money. The company I bought from said to return it (at my expense, of course). I am not spending another dime on that rip off. I do not waste money but I tossed it into the trash and took the loss. That mystery stuff could be toxic."
3,Lucete toilet spray 25 mi it des not look original,"Little expensive for it's for 25 mi and the bottle did not look like the original that show in Amozon, I feel that's not the real Lucete it has a clear tape with the mane Lucete,it is not printed on the cap and the bottle the way it's seen on Amozon.I have used this product and I know the real thing."
2,Some of the perfume had leaked out. It made for an embarassing gift.,"I purchased the perfume as a gift. When I opened the package I could strongly smell the perfume and discovered that it had leaked out of the top of the bottle onto the bottle, box, and packaging. Some of the perfume was missing as a result of this. If I was purchasing this for myself, it wouldn't have been as big of a concern, but it was embarassing giving it to someone as a gift with some of it missing."
1,Disappointment,"I ordered Lutece by Dana, but what I got is by another nameand the fragrance is not the same.Amazon was very kind to make a correction on the order. So Istill don't have the fragrance I ordered.What happened to Dana?If Lutece by Dana is available I would like to reorder.Edna Tamarin"
1,Not my style,I bought this item based on reviews. Definitely not to my liking. Not sure how to describe same. Going to give it to relative. Hoping her taste is different from mine.
4,Cuban Style Techniques,"I really enjoyed this DVD. She is good in demonstrating from every angle the movements and steps. However, I must say it is pretty short. There are only 3 Intermediate and 3 Advanced steps that she demonstrates on this DVD. Not good enough for the $36 i paid. Anyhow, she has a TIPS section that I really enjoyed on every step. This is mostly Cuban Style Salsa."
4,Salsa,This is a great CD. It makes it easier to follow if you already know how to dance salsa. I would recommend this CD if you want to improve on your salsa styling and footwork echniques.
1,This is not what you think it is,"It is painful to watch. The instructor needs to learn herself what a Latin move is. Besides, there is so little on this DVD that you better spent your money elsewhere. You can rent it on Netflix and see for yourself."
3,Not fantastic,"I enjoyed the read and don't regret the purchase. I agree with any positive comments others have made, but I had some problems with the book.First off, and this sort of thing bothered me with Shadows of the Empire too, Zahn uses ""the other"" hundreds of times (over 200 by the Kindle's count). For instance, ""'Yes, sir,' the other said carefully"" and ""He heard a note of regret in the other's voice."" Seriously annoying. Hundreds and hundreds of times.**SPOILER**The use of Force-blocking lizards that no one has heard of before now and Thrawn's superhuman intuition seem very deus ex machina-y."
5,A true work of art,"This is one of the truly well written books ever written. My comments are expressed in all of the other positive statements but I would like to say something to the naysayers:GET REAL! Also to the person who said this book was a ""poor written sequel"" to Shadows of the Empire:You are quite wrong! This was written years before SOTE! Think before you type."
4,"Good story, great new characters","This book was very entertaining with some new characters that I like very much, like Mara Jade and Talon Karde. The main villain in the story is the Grand Admiral Thrawn. I thought the Grand Admiral was a great villain for this story. He was very smart and very dangerous. His goal, of course, is to bring the galaxy under the control of the Empire.This book has new characters, new worlds, and new aliens. All of which are fun to read about. There were a couple of things that I thought were kind of unbelievable, even in the context of a Star Wars story. I thought the ysalimari were kind of dumb and as clever as the Grand Admiral was, there were times when he just jumped to some wild conclusions that didn't really seem to hold with me. But I was able to overlook these limitations since the rest of the story was so enjoyable and so well written."
5,Simply the Best in Star Wars,"If you like Star Wars, you CAN NOT live without this trilogy. That's all there is to be said. If Lucas was halfway intelligent, he'd hire Zahn to write his precious prequels.Zahn is a master. He knows his characters, he knows his tech, he knows how to write drama, he knows suspense, he knows action. He is simply the best Star Wars novel author."
3,"OK,","This book was pretty good, I'll give you that. But Zaun spent alot of time on the Impirials, and I think some Rebels should be there to! A good book, all in all."
2,HORRIBLE for a Star Wars book,This book was the WORST Star Wars book I have ever read. There was almost no action and there was nothing bad at the end which there must be to have a sequel
1,Doesn't deserve to be called a Star Wars story,"The good: some characters are well developed and treated that they come alive such as Han Solo and Lando.The bad: The story seems to go nowhere, first chapters are really boring. I think Zahn fails to set the apropriated tension since the beginning.The Ugly: How did Zahn dared to write a Star Wars story that doesn't features a dramatic ending with a light saber duel???!!! (sorry if I spoiled but I had to say this) This is not a complete story, it leaves you in the middle of something (nowhere in particular), it doesn't work as a unit like ep V which despite it is to be continued, it has a clear climax.I'm very disapointed by this novel."
1,Awful!,"I very, very rarely put a book down once I commit to it, but 200 pages into this thing and the story's going nowhere. Zahn took the characters we loved and turned them into one dimensional bores. No one in the book has any tension with any other characters, and none of them go anywhere. The whole book revolves around a ""defeat the bad guy"" plot. Don't get me wrong, I love books that offer nothing but entertainment, but I have to care about the characters to be entertained by their battles and struggles. ""Luke flipped away from the blaster shots"" just doesn't cut it with me. This book was boring, the characters were all turned into one dimensional bores, and 200 pages into the book I couldn't have cared less whether the characters I loved just died right then. If you love the movies, stay away from this low brow garbage."
1,Wow...that...that wasn't even clever.,"This book is a travesty. What happened to the interesting and comic dialogue of the Star Wars characters?! Who are these badly-made clones who spout stuff like ""Point""? Also, where the heck is the plot and action? In a word, LAME!!"
1,I don't see the big deal about Tomothy Zahn!!!!,"Zahn is VERY unrealistic! The Grand Admiral is supposed to be so smart that he can figure anything out, even when there is not enough info to come to his conclusions! Many of the Grand Admirals conclusions are IMPOSSIBLE. They are more like guesses, but Zahn just writes it off to the Admiral being a genius. Zahn should take a few classes in Logic and Philosophy."
1,Actually...,"1) the language is'nt sophisticated , it's just unrealistic.(i.e bad charectarization)2)Zahn DID imply that most of the Empire's officers died at Endor , espically aboard the Executor. That must be an awfully small ""Empire"".3)Thrawn attacked about five planets , and a few shipyards. Remember that the New Republic is a GALACTIC republic.4)Zhan was implying that the Grand Admirals were ""dealt with"". It would,ve been kinda nice if as in when and how.5)everybody knows what cocking and eybrow means , that just doesnt give you an excuse to use five times in every page( other Zhan-isque language , ""agreed"" , and ""point"" , point.. point.. point. I felt like I was reading bout a soccer game!)6)no , im afraid that zhan was'nt the best star wars author. he was only the first (after Dailey and Smith). and when his books came out we haad little to compare it with"
1,"Zahn's a good author, but this is Sacrilege","Let's get something straight: George Lucas authored Star Wars. All of it. He's the man who controls the Universe, and in my mind the man who will always control the Universe. Please don't take this the wrong way, Zahn is a good author, possibly a great author. If you want a good sci-fi book, read his Conqueror's series, not this or any other star wars book. As for why this book is not star wars... well in a word Thrawn. Come on, a brilliant general who can deduce a race's defense system by looking at one of their paintings? And he's got blue skin? This is not some cheezy Star Trek novel, it's Star Wars, damnit, and it should be treated as such."
5,Masterpiece,Even though this book was very long and at first I thought it was boring in the middle of the book I thought it was getting better and it was great.It leaves you in suspense so you should by the sequel.
4,A good book to start a series,"Ifound GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN to be very convining admiral of a imperial fleet, that's trying to take revenge on the NEW REPUBLIC. HIS tactic's are kept to himself as to his aproach to defeating his opponent, until it is necessary to explain himself to CAPTAIN PELLAEON. As for CAPTAIN PELLAEON i found his position to be intersting in trying to understand his admiral's tactic's in subverting the republic. Luke seems to be more mature and wiser in his dealing with other people in the story. Han and Leia have a good part in the story in that they have individual stories in the latter part in the book. I found TALON KARRDE to be a good indiction to the STAR WAR'S story and MARA JADE to be a little annoying about having lost her evil emperor and not having found luke all those year's. At times the story get's kind of slow in different areas of the book but overall it's a good start in a three book series."
1,THESE PEOPLE MUST BE STOPT!,"Where's the STAR WARS here? Book was boring, empty and it didnt have any of the things that the movies had. I hope that they will not make movies about these books 8non of them)."
3,Not for first-time readers,"I'd never read Heir to the Empire before, and I wasn't expecting author's notes on the sides of each page. They're distracting because it's tempting to read them. Unfortunately, they also give away things about future books in the series. I'm not sure there are major spoilers there, but Zahn talks about how certain characters will progress in the next two books and I'd rather read on and find out for myself. For me, I give this 3 stars. For people who have already read the trilogy, I could give it 5."
2,"Unimpressive, most unimpressive","The four things that ruin this book for me are: Zahn's writing style, the ysalamiri, C'Boath and Thrawn.Zahn's writing style is terrible. I read 'Heir to the Empire' but had to listen to the second two parts of this trilogy on audio cassette because I wanted to know what happened but I didn't want the pain of actually having to read the second two parts.The ysalamiri are ridiculous - a sort of kryptonite for the Jedi - as is C'Boath the dark Jedi Master. How come we hadn't heard of these before? They would have been pretty difficult to keep secret. And the way Thrawn can anticipate any bluff or double bluff and never be wrong makes him unbelievable as well. Mara Jade is a good character though.I suggest people read the X-Wing series first which is much better or even 'The Truce at Bakura' which is well written.Don't read this - listen to it on cassette if you want to know what happens - at least it's less painful that way. Read other books in the Star Wars saga first."
2,I can sum this up in one word - boring,This book was the first STAR WARS book I read and I can't help feeling a little disappointed. I'm glad it didn't put me off. The characters were excatly the same. Zahn has not put enough action. All it had in action was a lot of small things that really were quite boring
5,It was really true to the original trilogy.,"It was way cool ! The way Thrawn was potrayed was really interesting. He also had a certain likeness to Darth Maul. Pallenon was classic, and Luke was really interesting. C'Baoth was really twisted but he turned out okay. And the Noghri were really interesting along with Mara Jade and Talon Karrade. I was really fascinated by Thrawn's intuition, and stabibility. Timithoy Zahns Trilogy fits perfectly with the Star Wars Galaxy."
3,"Book is great, audio book is AWEFUL!","The books in this trilogy are a fantastic read. The audio book of Heir to the Empire is the worst I have ever heard. The reader, Denis Lawson, is the most dry and inexpressive reader to ever have recorded his voice. Don't get the audio book for this. I gave it a 3 for Timothy Zahn's story. Listener beware!"
4,Just as good as the movies,"This book did all that the movies couldn't from the very start. Taking the imagination on a old favorite rollercoaster. All the original cast is in the book from our favorite wookie to r2d2. Yet their is also new favorites from a cunning admiral to the most mysterious woman in the galaxy. Zahn is a master at deveoping people, great plots and interesting situations. It is so good I had trouble putting it down more than one late night. His style has a never ending great description of new worlds and cultures. With in depth writing on their past and present standing. It's an incredible universe he throws out to us and it will take you on the next thrillig chapter(literally) in the star wars adventures. (I never give novels that are just for fun any higher rating than a four! So it was very well done.)"
4,"Very good, but not romantic enough.","I thought this book was very well written. It started out kind of boring but got very interesting very quickly. It was exciting, and, for the most part, realistic. But Han and Leia acted like strangers to each other! They never kissed, never even hugged, and that made me quite unhappy! Other than that, though, it was a good book."
5,you have to read this book its number one,i think that this book was a master peice it one of the best books ever i love the stroy luke leia han are back and as good as ever any starwars fan will love it i wish thay would make a moive of it so you could see all the cool stuff in it
4,An awesome book!,Definently could be episodes 7-9. Has the Star Wars pace down and explores all the characters to the maximum. Lots of action too.
5,This was a wonderful book!,"I stumbled over this book in a bookstore after I was looking for another Star Wars book, and I decided to buy it. I read it, and I immediately went out and bought the other two books. I couldn't wait to find out about what would happen, and all of the other Star Wars books I have read just don't compare. Zahn is truely the master of the Star Wars Universe."
5,Great read! Can't miss this one!,"Ahhhh, the book that popularized Star Wars books and opened the way for more excellent Star Wars adventures. A master strategist that picks tactics from what he can interpret from the psychologies of his enemies (which he determines from looking at their artwork). What could be better? This was the first Star Wars book since 1983 and this was the one that gave the opportunity for other authors to try their hand at Star Wars. In my opinion, the best Star Wars trilogy ever (except maybe Solo and Company)."
5,The Greatest Book EVER!!!!!,Heir to the Empire is a wonderful book that continues the great adventures of Luke Skywalker. I loved all of the great detail about the battles in the book.
2,Star Wars without the Good Parts,"I came into Heir to the Empire expecting a piece of speculative fiction on par with other stars of the genre like Dune, The Lord of the Rings, and the Dresden Files.That is not why I got at all.Instead, what I got was a plot which moves at a snail's pace between dull events, descriptions which consistently feel lifeless, characterization that is a poor imitation of that which the movies provide, characters and details in numbers that bog down the story, and technique and style which are sorely lacking. The only aspect of this story keeping it from a one-star review is Grand Admiral Thrawn, the main antagonist, with his fascinating approach to warfare, planning, and investigation.In the end, I'm puzzled as to why this book is considered a classic. It's something I would not recommend to anyone, fan of Star Wars or otherwise."
5,The New Empire,"From the other star wars books I thought that this one was great. It tells of the new empire and the continuation of Luke, leai, han, and chewie. I thought this book was great. I could not put it down. I highly suggest that you read this if you are any type of star wars fan. I will continue to read Dark Force Rising. The second book of the Thwran trilogy."
5,Movies?,"Great books with an excellent story line. Thrawn makes a great enemy in the story and creates a lot of suspense. As a true Star Wars fan, I can honestly say I would have been happier had they made the Thrawn Trilogy into movies instead of the prequels. Anyways, amazing books, worth the money."
1,Really? Magic gecko?,Right about the time the speckle gecko showed up with force blocking powers is right about the time I stopped reading. Don't waste your time.
3,DISAPPOINTING! DOES NOT LIVE TO THE TRILOGY!,"I appreciated the book because of the familiar characters, but that was not enough to cover up for all the other shortcomings. The characters seemed to have lost their aura. Even Han Solo seemed to be uptight & not as funny as he used to be. The author tried to cover so many territories that a lot of loopholes were left open. For instace, he either forgot or deliberately did not include what happened to C'Baoth after being brought to Jomark. He dwelt about the cloned Jedi master but dwindled afterwards. What about the Noghris? Will they side finally with Leia? What about Mara? Has the narrow escape made her change her mind against her plot against Luke? I think, he should have covered all this & saw it to the end, isntead of making the story long but hanging."
5,The best Star Wars Books EVER!,"I read this series several years ago and on occasion I read them again, and again, and again. I just adore the way Zahn carried on the legacy, the right way. I loved the introduction of Mara Jade.Besides Truce at Bakura (another author) these is the BEST BEST BEST Star Wars books ever if you are a fan of the original movies."
5,You can really hear the music,"I first read Heir of the Empire in 1993, and although I was a Star Wars fan by then, it made me even a bigger fan. Since then I've again read it a couple of times and everytime I am excited by the way Zahn continues the movies. The characters and especially the ones he introduces are just awesome. Grand Admiral Thrawn, who takes over the falling Empire, is the best villain of all the books, Mara Jade is a great character to play opposite Luke Skywalker. The intriguing subplots that join smoothly together to one great story are packed with all the good stuff that you loved about the movies. and sometimes I really heard the soundtrack in my ears. This Heir to the Empire trilogy is the best that was ever written for the Star wars universe and it is a must-read not only for the fans."
3,Good,The book definitely had a Star Wars feel to it. I appreciated the deeper look I had into my favorite characters.
5,The absolute best Star Wars Novel.,"Heir to the Empire, is simply the best extended universe Star Wars novel. It is a great starting point for those getting into the EU and it ideally is what we would hope a possible episode 7 is. Where the Dark Empire series took a turn for the ridiculous, the Thrawn trilogy tends to go more towards subtlety. Granted there are definitely moments of, ""Of all the spaceships in all the planets, the bad guy was right there?!?!"" But this is not supposed to be some literary romp through space and time. This is supposed to be an entertaining adventure that gives us further insight into characters we love. No matter what Disney makes this will always be my part 7."
5,They've done it again.,"I saw my first star wars movie when I was 2. It was love at first sight. I got my Thrawn trilogy from my grandparents. I've read so many star wars books I lost count around 50 and I'm only 14. I've collected lots of star wars figures and vehicles. I honor you George Lucas, Timothy Zahn, Michael Stackpole, and all the other creators of the star wars galaxy."
4,Excellent treatment of the original Star Wars trilogy characters and universe,"Excellent treatment of the original Star Wars trilogy characters and universe.Great story. Great villain(s). Great settings. Great trilogy. For any Star Wars fan (who knows that Empire is better than Jedi, and Han shot first) these are essential reading."
3,Meh,"Not bad. Not amazing. It is good, but I can see some of the writing is lacking. Too many characters ""snarl"" and ""growl"" and ""grimace.""Oh well."
4,it'll do until Episode 1,"It's okay. Not the best book I've ever read, but probably the best Star Wars book there is, which, unfortunately, isn't really saying all that much.If there was one thing that really drove me insane about the book, though, it was the sloppy editing and reuse of phrases. If I ever hear the words ""in a heartbeat"" or any variation thereof again, someone's getting hurt."
2,Paper thin characters. Spoilers await.,"Overall a good read that`ll take up two of your summer reading days with all the characters never speaking more than two lines. Luke/Leia and Han getting out of every sticky situation they encounter and winning every battle. Grand Admiral Thrawn continue`s to lose every bit of the way. Kardde and everyone else seem to ""get over"" on this guy and it`s somewhat annoying that he can surmise exactly what`s going on in the minds of the enemy which doesn`t seem to amount to anything. Zahn to me is like Jack Higgens where you don`t question you just read and turn the pages. Mara Jade is constantly whinning about how Luke destroyed her life and while Leia is pregnant with twins she gets blasted around at many an encounter also. The Dark Jedi (C`Baoth)never mentions the name of the guy he defeated and the character is already rendered toothless and staid by the fact that he`s a clone (.....0r is that ""clown""?)."
2,Unlike other i think this is boring,This book is slow and drags on. I know im one of the few who think so but this isnt Zahn at his best. It was almost impossible to finish reading.
2,List why I did'nt like this book,"1)sophisticated unnatural sounding language (ie.""indeed"", ""agreed"" etc..)2)the empire , apparently , consists of a dozen Star Destroyers , and every imperial officer died at Endor(?).3)Thrawn almost beat the Rebellion , what? , did I miss something?4)how did the New Rebublic ""Account"" for the other twelve Imperial Grand Admirals?5)what the heck does ""cocking an eyebrow"" mean and how do you do that?6)these glaring mistakes , unfortunately , set the standards for the rest of the Star Wars novels. shame on you Zahn."
2,A great disappointment,"After hearing so much about this book I finally read it, only to find that it wasn't nearly as good as it was made out to be. I found the language dry, the characters two dimensional and the plot less then riveting. Apparently the sequels are better, but this book has put me off the series all together."
3,Zahn doesn't have the talent to pull off a Star Wars Novel.,"All in all, this is a good book with a good plot.Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the Star Wars trilogy.Towrite a Star Wars book, you must have an intimate knowledge about how the Star Wars characters and universe works. Any Star Wars fanatic will notice un-characteristic actions and plot lapses. But if you are just a fan of Star Wars and are looking for a good story, go ahead and pick up this book."
3,A Worthy Opponent in Thrawn,"ACK!! I meant to give it 5 Stars. and now I can't change it.Vader is dead, The Emperor is dead, who else is there to cause disruption in the galaxy?? Admiral Thrawn.Yes, this book is great. It's the characters we love, the spaceships we thought were cool, and the jedi action we demand. But there is something else about this book that makes it stand out so much. The bad guys are, well, pretty darn awesome. The Empire has had a facelift. No longer are they petty fumbling stormtroopers, but rather competant warriors and leaders fighting to regain a foothold in the galaxy, and they are led by Thrawn, who is a military genius.This first book is of course just the set up for the other two books, but it is a great read. All the new characters are worthy additions to the Star Wars universe and the EU probably wouldn't exist without this capable first part of the three book cycle."
5,One of a kind,"This book is amazing. The book itself is great. Heir is easily one of my favorite Star Wars books of all time and the 20th anniversary edition is a work of art in its own right. The amount of detail that Tim Zann added to this version of the book makes it well worth the cost to me. The extras may get in the way for anyone looking to just read the book, but for someone like me who had already read the book a few years ago this was a way to own the book and learn some more about the Star Wars universe.The actual story itself is classic Star Wars, with the main characters getting into problems forced on them by other characters and themselves. The empire is still the bad guy, but some of the characters show a different side to the empire than is normally portrayed by other writers and in the films.Bottom line: buy this if you have ever wanted to own a copy of the book. Also, if you have been reading Star Wars and have never read this book read it now. This was the original Star Wars book."
3,Has its moments,"I normally do not read derivative fiction, but I like the Star Wars universe, and Zahn's books have been recommended to me for years. The biggest problem I have with his writing is he seriously overuses certain phrases and words, and this persists throughout the trilogy. I won't say what they are, in hopes that you won't notice. Another small objection - as someone who has seen the original Star Wars trilogy countless times, whenever a character says something in these books that they said in the movie, it really jumps out at me, and if it's a stretch to make them say it in the particular situation, it's really obvious. There were several such points in the Thrawn Trilogy. What Zahn was good at was setting a good pace, believable characterization, generally good dialogue, a competence at describing settings, and generally good plotlines. A couple of the main characters were weakly drawn, but were not distractingly bad. Overall I found the whole trilogy fairly enjoyable."
5,"LOVE IT, love it, love it","This book is the only way to start reading Star Wars novels. Zahn is an excellent author, and his plot and characterization is wonderful. I love Thrawn...all of his original characters are awesome. The only things I had a problem with were the 'hot chocolate' Luke parts. Read this book."
4,Heir To The Empire-It drags but then takes off!,"I started to read this book an I found it a tad bit interesting. I kept reading and about half way through I said enough! This book is too slow! Then a year later I picked up the book again. I went about 3 chapters back from where I had left off to recollect what was happening. After I remembered I just couldn't put the book down! With over 200 pages left to go I finished it that day! Belive me, you'll say THIS IS TOO SLOW but keep going! It'll pick up its pace!"
3,"Good try, I guess","The idea was there, but the plot was slow moving, and a little boring. The new characters, especially Pellaeon and Mara Jade are pretty cool, but the Bothan and Thrawn are kind of annoying."
5,WISH LIST,I HOPE LUCAS USES THESE AS A GUIDE TO MAKE THE POST-QUELS SOMETHING MORE AMAZING THEN ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN ON THE BIG SCREEN.
4,Great Book! Zahn really got me with this one,"Timothy Zahn really outdid himself with this book. It's great to read, and I couldn't put it down. There are a few points though - I would have like to have known WHAT happened to the Grand Admiral, who were apparently just 'dealt with'. And sometimes it kept you in suspense for too long. I recommend reading it though, and I have to go and read part 2!"
1,comfortable but fell apart after a couple of months!,"I work in a jail, so I am on my feet for 8 to 12 hours at a time. Comfort is important to me and these boots fit the bill. These boots were very comfortable and did not take long to break in like some people say. The side zipper is a bit of a time saver and a nice feature. The composite toe is a lot lighter then steel toe, and just as good as a steel toe for what I need. However, after just a couple of months, the rubber and stitching along the back of the heal of one of the boots COMPLETELY ripped! The other boot held up so maybe the one was just defective, but in my opinion, for the cost, it should not have fallen apart that quickly at all. Of course, it was just out of warrantee when this happened too. If the one had not fallen apart, I would have given them a 4 as they are a little squeaky (minor problem)."
3,Incorrect Nutritional Information,"While the product may be tasty and fine, the nutritional information displayed here (100 calories for the entire bowl) is incorrect. I visited the Healthy Choice website to verify my information -- the soup is 100 calories per cup. Nearly 200 calories for the entire bowl."
5,Healthy Choice for me,"This soup surprised me when I tasted it. I have been battling with my weight and I have been trying to eat foods low in calories and sodium. I stunbled upon healthy choice soup and tried it. WOW!! I didn't believe that it was ""diet food"". I recommend the full line"
3,"Good soup, but not sure of the value of ordering through Amazon","The soup is delicious; Healthy Choice is a great brand. I particularly like it because it is low sodium. However, I'm not sure that using Amazon to order soup is really more convenient or cheap than just going to the grocery store."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was looking forward to trying this soup based on the excellent reviews posted about this product. Imagine my surprise when I opened one and discovered that 80% of the bowl was chicken broth--and not a very tasty one at that. The remainder of the soup consisted of a few small pieces of chicken along with a little rice, celery and such.There is no way this product is worth over $3 a bowl. This is one of the biggest ripoffs I ever seen. If you like chicken and rice, try Hormel Compleats."
4,Better Than Cans,The Microwave Version has 14 oz. The can version has 15 oz. It's hard to open the microwave can and a small amount is often spilled while opening. But you can microwave this product in the container which is convenient. The taste is exactly the same in both versions. I recently bought the can version from Amazon and most of the cans were dented. See my review. I've bought this soup at Safeway and Target. The magic price is $2.00 per can. Amazon often has it well below that although you always have to buy 12.
3,"Lots of broth, light on taste","Healthy Choice soups are not my first choice when it comes to ready-made soups. These are convenient to take to work, though, so I often pair one of these with some crackers or a bag of tortilla chips to round-out a meal. They're easy to open and heat.The Chicken with Rice Soup is a little light on the rice, however. This is not a hearty meal. There's much more broth than chicken, rice, or vegetables in the package. The flavor is light, and especially not as salty as other ready-made soups. The chicken, vegetables and the rice are of decent quality, though, and this soup almost always seems ""fresh"" after I heat it -- it doesn't seem like it's from a can or container.One plus - I find that the Healthy Choice lids are much easier to remove than those of their competition, with no strange tabs to squeeze or excessive force required to remove the plastic lids. Recommended for a light lunch especially when trying to watch your calorie intake."
3,Healthy Choice Soup.... New formula NOT as good.,"I just got the new shipment with new formula which has more Sodium, more Calories and less Chicken.I canceled my subscription."
1,Not worth the price,"Go to a major food chain (like shop rite, pathmark) and you can purchase these for less (and you won't have to buy 12 of them. Amazon's food is never a better bargain - especially when you have to buy such a large quantity."
5,MNCook,"Yummmy - works great in the microwave; very comforting; great taste, lots of rice and veggies."
1,Salty,"Healthy Choice Chicken with Rice Soup, 14-Ounce Microwave Bowls (Pack of 12)The salt content is 20%; it shouln't be more than 15%; ideally, 10%.Get rid of the salty items, reduce price 50%, and stock low-sodiumitems.Thanks.jim"
2,Convenient but rather tasteless,"I was attracted to the idea of heating up some soup as my afternoon snack rather than snacking away on pita chips and bought these from Amazon.On the positive side they are 1) convenient 2) just the right size for a snack 3) reasonably healthy judging by the nutrition panel (90 cal per 240g and there's 397g in the container so 149 cal for the whole thing) 6g protein, 1.5g fat, 13g carb 2g fiber 10% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C.For me though, the big negative is the taste. Despite the picture of a spoon with chicken, rice, and veges, this is not a thick soup and is 80% stock; this would not be a problem if the stock actually tasted like chicken but it doesn't. I find the whole thing really tasteless and I am disappointed. Maybe the Pacific chicken stock spoiled my taste buds but I don't like these at all and have to add all kinds of seasoning to squeeze more flavor into it. It is doubtful I'll buy them again."
3,Too salty for me,"I have been experimenting with adding more rice to the soup to make it less salty overall, but that defeats the whole convenience aspect. Other than that the container is convenient and effective and it's a good amount of soup. Too bad it's just too salty for me."
2,Journey back in time,I bought this book and thought it was about a 3 week paddleing adventure but turns out it's more about the history of the James River or Virginia instead there is some paddling content but makes for hard reading as the writer get side tracked about history I guess he was a history major in college.
2,once was enough,"I read about the journey when it came out in the newspaper and was interested to see how the book would be. The addition of more of the so-called ""adventure"" is not very interesting and comes across as filler. The story worked best as a shorter newspaper series."
4,An insight into Virginia history through a tiny canoe,"This is the perfect book to compliment anything you may have regarding the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I never truly realized how much history is along the mighty James River until I read this book. Starting as a trickle of water high in the mountains of western VA, through the central plains, and finally to the mighty river feeding into the Chesapeake Bay. Mr. Swift points out many historical places/things on his journey down the river which is a joy to read. By the end of the book, I felt like I was along with the expedition the whole way down!The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars, is that it wold have been nice to include a map of the James River somewhere in the book, that way one could follow along and get a better idea where he was at every chapter."
1,"an ego trip, not a canoe trip","The author comes acros as egotistical. Most readers, other than his family and friends, probably won't care about his opinions and the personal details of his trip. When telling us of the people he encounters who work, live and play along the rivers banks, he displays a superior attitude (the educated reporter meets us uneducated local yokels)"
3,Enjoyable Mix of History and Travel Journal,"I thouroughy enjoyed this book. I felt the pace of the narrative flowed nice and easy. I particularly appreciated the fact that the author felt no need to burden the reader with any kind of personal quest to rediscover himself. Swift pretty much gets on the river and reports his observations in an honest and non-serious fashion. No feel good environmental messages here. Just the plain first hand observations that many readers could do themselves. This book won't keep you up all night, but it gives a reasonably objective description of the James River Valley and a nice casual dose of local history. I liked it!"
5,Incredible acousic sound as always,The Corrs' music sounds the best when played acoustic. During an EPK session of their album BORROWED HEAVEN the Irish siblings performed unplugged 7 songs of it - two of them are as B-sides on this CD single. A must-have for all the fans!
1,"Really great scoop in form, terrible quality","This scoop is great. It slides right into the hardest ice cream, and when you twist the handle, it makes a shapely ball of ice cream easily. The scooping part is stainless steel (which I'm a fan of), and I took off a point for the plastic handle (although it doesn't conduct cold as much, which does make it comfortable to hold).UPDATE:The scooping part is definitely NOT stainless steel. I'm not sure where I got that information from. The scoop has started to peel and for some reason, has started to pit (yes, pit). Strangely enough, it also has some staining that won't wash away (I've never had this problem with a spoon before). Would recommend against buying until they make the scoop out of actual stainless steel. Terrible quality."
4,"Good scoop, could use a better grip","We received this with some other items off our wedding registry. I like this one over the many others I've used. However, I get a better grip my small hands with the Tupperware one. I like the size of the scoops I can get with this one, though. Overall, this is a great item."
5,Zyliss 71372 ice cream scoop,"Finally! An ice cream scoop that fits the human hand and can handle hard ice cream. We've had this for several months now, and it works beautifully. Totally great tool."
2,"Great at first, but coating bubbles and peels off","When it first arrived, this scoop was great. It easily cut through hard ice cream. In less than a year, however, the coating inside the scoop began to bubble and peel off. Now I worry about the coating being eaten my someone, not to mention the scoop no longer works like it once did. Going in the trash as soon as my new one (from another brand) arrives."
2,Nice for the first year or two!,I have had this ice cream scoop for three years and it was great for the first year or two. I have never put it in the dishwasher and the metal is peeling. I am not sure if the chemicals on the inside are eating through or what is happening. Whatever it is I do not want to use it to scoop ice cream for my kids anymore.
5,"Ice cream scoop, the production process is very good","Has been operating an ice cream shop, in addition to the sale of ice cream, which also sells ice cream spoon. Distribution of a variety of digging spoon, some spoon craft well, but the design is unreasonable, the color does not look good, no buyers likes; some design well, but not ergonomic, digging hard ice cream, feeling the hand of hurts. This spoon, whether in technology, color, material well. Is recommended."
1,Only Got a Few Months of Use...,"...before the plastic at the top of the handle began to crack and flake away; soon after, the ""metallic"" surface of the scoop began to pit. I complained to the company, sent photo as requested, but have yet to receive a replacement which, according to other reviews here, would have roughly the same lifespan. Not what I expect from Zyliss products - this one should be completely revamped or discontinued."
2,"Not the best, but soooo close","I was aware of the negative reviews before my purchase (I've had the scooper for at least six months as of this review). The shape and the handle are really nice, it feels good in the hand and scoops very well but it's one problem seems almost universal. The coating does pit and peel in very small flakes. I hand wash the scooper with a sponge, nothing rough, and regular dish soap; nothing more. It really is a shame because initially it's a great product but it won't last. I have been putting off buying a Zeroll but I think that is the next step.PS:I agree with another reviewer that stated that generally Zyliss makes great products. This COULD be a great product but they have to get rid of that coating."
4,GOOD,Good item so far. have not ran it though the dish washer yet so we will see how well it holds up!
5,Awesome quality!,If you are looking for a great quality product then get this one and you will love it. It also looks very attractive and solid.
2,"OK, But Scoop Surface Deteriorating","The design (shape) is perfect, as is the weight and handle. But I suspect the metal scoop surface is not dishwasher safe. My scoop surface, as so many others here have reported, is deteriorating (corroding). I wouldn't buy again."
4,Impressively Cuts Through Hard Ice Cream,"I was skeptical about the reviews about the scooper taking care of frozen ice cream without herculean effort, but it's accurate. It's not a miracle, but it does the trick with some firm effort."
2,Not so durable,"Nice and heavy to start with, but after just a month the handle is separating. It's a pretty good scope otherwise, but I would not buy again. I got an OXO Good Grips scoop at the same time, which hasn't had any problems and which is much easier to use with its clever pointed scoop. The Zyliss looks nice, but the OXO is more functional. Would not this one again!"
4,Ice cream scoop,Heavy duty scoops ice cream easily and handle is comfortable to hold. Arrived on time in new packaging.Highly recommend.
1,Corrosion,"I own several Zyliss products that I quite like, this one is very disappointing. After maybe 5 uses, it showed signs of corrosion. I hand wash my dishes with soft soap and sponge and it never happened before si the product is the problem.Otherwise, yes, it's ergonomic and does a good job."
5,I'm so glad I bought this.,"I bought this ice cream scoop to replace an older all metal one. I'm so glad that I did. The weight of this ice cream scoop is perfect. It glides through ice cream and gives a perfect scoop size (I didn't really know which size to order.) I use warm water and a gentle sponge with soap to clean it, and it's held up really well, like brand new each and every time I use it. Great product!"
2,Good design except CORROSION of scoop,Had two. Current one just like the first one is seriously corroded. Scoop surface appears to be chrome but not. If it is aluminum the anodizing breaks down. A different brand that was aluminum had the same problem. My guess is anodized aluminum not suitable.Generally Zyliss makes quality kitchen tools. This has serious flaw. Wrote them and they offered a new one free if I sent the old one in. Not worth the time and cost. The corrosion is serious over time. Maybe a teflon coating?Fourcents
4,Great Scoop,"I am very pleased with the scoop. It is sturdy, heavy and dishwasher safe. It does not cut through super-hard ice cream as well as it claims to, but it does a great job otherwise. We replaced a higher-end scoop (the kind with the chemicals in the handle that are supposed to soften hard ice cream) and we like this one even better."
5,UltaScoop!,"My search for perfection in a ice-cream scoop may have come to an end. Over the years I have tried many an ice cream scoop in many a tub of frozen ice-cream. To date none have come close to the Zyliss scoop in either ease of use or style. (The solid construction looks quite nice) This is the only style of scoop I have found that is superior to the standard metal ice-cream parlor scoop. If you like ice-cream this a must!I would like to add that after a year of use the metal is starting to flake a little... but if you know scoops, it seems to be bound to happen. I just scrub it off good and it is still my best scoop around."
4,"Cute and easy to use, but corrodes","We've had this ice cream scoop for 4 years in the pink handle model. It's very easy to use and easily scoops ice creams. I was afraid of the coating deteriorating in the dishwasher, so we always handwash it and never leave it laying in the sink overnight in water. However, despite my efforts there are still spots of corrosion that appeared after a couple years of use. I don't think it affects the performance, but I'm slightly disappointed since these rated so highly and they seem so durable. I still would recommend it to others, but just know that handwashing won't prevent the eventual wear and tear of the scoop from happening."
3,Not My Definition of Scooping,"Yes, it's sturdy and attractive. Does it scoop? Well, that depends upon your definition of scooping. I'd call it more of an ice cream scraper. If you're serving ice cream in a bowl, it'll probably work fine for you. I happen to love ice cream cones, so a rounded scoop works much better for me."
5,Love this scooper!,"Okay, so I went out and bought a pint of Haagen Dazs (sp?) just so I could try this scooper out! I compare it to the one with the antifreeze and this Zyliss one wins. The handle feels secure and substantial in my hand; the scoop is larger (I really like that) and it cuts into the hard ice cream because of it's thinner scoop. This is a very good quality scooper and for $7 plus change, what a deal!"
1,BEWARE - non stick coating chips off,"Before I bought this, I used to use a regular spoon. I would leave rock hard ice cream on the counter to soften. More often than not, I would forget about it, and would return to an inedible soupy mess. This scoop can go right through rock hard ice cream, without much effort. Don't want to know what the special chemical coating is, cause it sure works well. No rusty springs, no malfunctioning parts.POST SCRIPT 2011 - It is year three, and flakes of the special coating on the spoon part are coming off. It is scary. I am buying a different brand. Never again. I expected lifetime use. Was I naive."
1,Waste of Money,"I've had this exactly seven days, have hand washed and dried it after each use, and a large part of the metal coating came off tonight in my husband's ice cream as he scooped it. I believe this coating must be defective."
4,Very easy to use,"We've been through a few ice cream scoops in our house, and this one gets the best ratings from everyone. Even the kids find it easier to scoop out ice cream on their own."
3,Not noticeably easier than other scoops,"Yes, it scoops ice cream. However, it is not much easier to use than other (less expensive) scoops, like those you may already have."
5,Finally A Ice Cream Scoop I cannot Break,"The best ice cream scooper I have ever owned, you will be surprised how heavy and well built this thing is."
4,pretty close,"my family loves ice cream before bed nightly. i have amassed quite a collection of scoopers and scrapers but this item feels different from the get-go. it weighs something in your hand, a heft that makes the job easier. the actual scoop might be a bit larger but it makes for a pretty presentation. way to go zyliss!!!"
1,Corrosion on this scoop is a deal breaker.,"I bought this several years ago, and within a short amount of time corrosion started to set in on this scoop. It worked great up until that point. But the corrosion got so bad, I had to toss the unit when metal flakes were coming off into my icecream. Here is a photo I took of this scoop before tossing it out. [...] I can not recommend anyone purchase this until these issues are resolved by the manufacturer."
1,"Looks cool, failed, now too late to return","Like other reviewers - this is a really nice scoop but quickly pitted and corroded (within about two months, only hand washed). Once comprimised, who knows how much of the coating material gets ingested.Generally Zylis makes quality kitchen tools. This has serious flaw.Fail."
2,disappointed with the finish,"the non-stick finish is bubbling up and chipping off the bowl of the scoop after a few years of use. The scoop works very well, but I don't like the idea of eating chips of the silvery stuff."
2,Works great but the metal coating comes off in a few months..,This is a great design but the quality control does look to be lacking sorely! The white scoop also looks to be a different shape ?! Anyhow after a few months of light use the metal coating is 'bubbling' and soon this will not be usable:( So buyer beware!
2,poor quality,"Great design. Easy to use. However, this is made of poor quality metal. After using this for some time, the metal covering of the scoop bubbles up, and comes off. Do not buy. Choose another scoop made with quality materials."
3,You get what you pay for,A little loose and not the solid feel you would want from an ice cream scooper. The ergonomic shape is nice and it slices into ice cream average. I guess it's ok.
1,Coated metal - Didn't last like I hoped,"I saw nowhere in the description that this was another coated scoop, and purchased it when another scoop of this brand we had began to lose bits of it's non-stick coating. I felt this was surely unsafe and wanted a plain metal scoop, one that was shaped like all the ones so sturdy and good at cutting into hard ice cream. It says dishwasher safe... however, after only three washes I could see the coating getting little white pits on the inside of the scoop that would not wash off by hand. Right away it became obvious this was coated too as the surface quickly got little bubbles at those spots which broke/peeled off. So sad to throw out another and keep searching."
2,Not happy,"I purchased two of these on the recommendation of my favorite food channel person. It works well. Unfortunately, just like any other scoop I purchased, it chips. I specifically did not place it in the dishwasher even though it was stated to be safe. Both scoops corroded and I had to throw them away. You would think that by now, someome should be able to come up with a decent ice cream scoop. Very disappointed."
5,Zyliss ice cream scoop,This is the most comfortable ice cream scoop I have ever used. It's perfectly weighted and feels great resting in your hand. It scoops well too.
5,You will never buy another ice-cream scoop again.,"This is the best scoop you will ever buy. It can handle the most frozen ice cream and it does this without injuring you. I have no regrets. It is heavy, solid and can take the pressure.It is one of the best products in my kitchen. The shape of the scoop facilitates the job. I can't stop using it!"
4,Here's the Scoop!,"The handle is very comfortable and the scoop shape really works in cutting through hard ice cream.The silver paint scratches and chips easily. Since I was worried about ingesting paint, I just stripped the paint off.I polished the scoop and now it's bare aluminum. (Yeah, too much time on my hands.)"
4,An insight into minds and lives of WW2 soldiers.,"Fans of World War Two history will enjoy this book. Instead of a top-down, view from a leader's position, this book gives the reader insights into the thoughts of those who served on the front lines, on both sides of the war. If you liked Band of Brothers (either the book or the miniseries) you will enjoy this book."
5,Our parents' generation will never be matched,"It seems only yesterday, that I found those letters, airmail and v-mail in mom's desk. Then I saw the call for letters and submitted one, with photo. As I read my dad's letter and those of his peers and ""enemies"" I wonder how they did it and came home and became more normal than we seem to be. Bless them all. Read and enjoy all the love and caring these men and women had for family and country"
2,Good start followed by disappointment,"I was debating whether to go with this set or another (tried and trusted in the past, but $100 more expensive). After much deliberation I decided that Irwin's reputation to take the risk.I've had the set since 18/1/2012. Drill bits lived up to expectations, taps did a good job too on steel and aluminum. The only annoying thing was that everything in the case but drill bits lay loose in their sockets. I once accidentally knocked the case of the bench and enjoyed the next 30 min trying to collect all 80 pieces off the floor. I nearly lost a couple of small taps.However, today I was completely and utterly disappointed when 1/4-20 bit just broke off in a whole of the aluminum extrusion that I was tapping, essentially rendering an expensive part useless. To top it off, it's almost impossible to extract it out of the whole without damaging surrounding area.So, I am pretty upset now."
5,PERFECT,"This is awesome, it was so great. The plot is a bit confusin' but it was grand! VERY GOOD. RATED-R for intense animated violence/gore, images of wounded, and disturbing images"
5,This is second of 2 DVD set,"Betrayal is the second of a 2-DVD set with Trust. This DVD, Betrayal, contains episodes 3 and 4 of 4. I bought this one from Amazon thinking it was the first DVD in the series. The descriptions did not make it clear to me which was the first one to watch, so I hope I have clarified this point for the next shopper.That being said, we really enjoyed these animations, and I have ordered Trust and the first 3 DVDs of the (related?) TV series. I do not especially like Anime (I thought Princess Mononoke was boring) but I really enjoyed the romanticized, historical aspects of this plot. The dubbing and subtitles, both in English, are amusingly VERY different. For example, the subtitles talk about the rebellion in Hagi (a place we have visited) but the dubbed dialogue does not."
5,Rurouni Kenshin OVA,"The Rurouni Kenshin OVA series is probably one of the only series that Kenshin fanatics will admit is better than the TV series. Unlike the TV series' light-hearted comedy, this series is moody and serious. The animation is fluid, and the character designs are very realistic. The symbolism in the story is amazing. I highly recommend this series, whether you're a fan of Rurouni Kenshin or just anime in general!"
2,Disappointed,"This ""movie"", if you want to call it that, is so cr**py. Why? Well the plot sucked. Out of all the opponents that Kenshin faced in the tv series, this one is just plain stupid. He's so dense and caught up w/ the past that he couldn't see the hurt in the eyes of the one he loves until it was too late. The only thing that keeps this ""movie"" from being tragic is the comic of the Kenshin group.Oh yeah, DO NOT watch the english dub(done by same voice actors as OAVs), and if you hate reading subtitles, you might as well skip this ""movie"" altogether."
1,if you liked trust and betrayal your not going to like this,"ok, i just finished watching this. when i put the dvd in the player i was expecting some serious anime. what i got was a cross between pokemon and the first two discs in the series. to start out the animation is totally pokemon. you have the big eyes, the silly 5 year old humor(when someone gets hit they show little swirly things where their eyes should be), totally different story line. this movie has no relevance to the others in the series. the animation on trust and betrayal was awesome. i would say the animation on this is ok at best. no stunning visuals like the realistic water or the snow falling. i cant see why they made this so cartoony and then have a bunch of blood. i guess they were trying to appeal to a bigger audience in japan. i dont know this movie just didnt make sense. dont waste your money, buy something good with it."
4,Great Album!!!,"This Cd is only for authentic 80's dance music lovers and I am talking electro-funky, the bass, the beat, the voice, all is there to make you move. ""Reach out"" is my favorite and the reason I purchased the CD, a jewel in my collection, Audrey wheeler sensual voice over the electric beat is what made mid-80's dance music the best. If you loved shannon's "" my heart divided"" , you'll love ""reach out""!! Buy it do not hesitate, this is mid-80 thumping electronic dance music at its best!! Miss those times, Glad I can listen to them and reminisce, go AND GET IT!!! A MUST HAVE!!"
5,Miracle worker!,"This stuff is great. It takes odors out of clothing, rugs, pillows, wool blankets-you name it Bac Out can do it. It is expensive but well worth the money. I use unscented detertergent in my laundry and this adds just enough natural scent that the wash seems refreshed. I love it! It worked well on cloth diapers too."
1,Don't use if you have Porphyria!,"Don't use this product if have Porphyria. It contains a solvent, and I've never gotten it out of my carpet. The company laughed off my complaint - even though the product made me terribly sick! When I asked for help in removing it from my carpet, I got very bad advice - as they said to use their All Purpose Cleaner to get it out. They don't even follow their own MSDS (safety) sheets, and the 'combination' of these two chemicals was wicked! I could have died as a result of this chemical exposure, and they could have cared less. So be careful of so-called 'non-toxic' cleaners. What is safe for one is not necessarily so for another."
1,Doesn't work for me,I was hopeful this would be a useful product and healthy for the environment. I was very disappointed in that it really was not effective in stain or odor removal. Using white vinegar produced equal or better results and is much cheaper.
5,Best product around for eliminating animal urine odor!,"I have an elderly cat with bladder problems. I wanted to eliminate the urine odor and not eliminate the cat. Bac-Out was recommended to me at the health food store and I was amazed at the results! In the past I used a white vinegar/water solution, but Bac-Out works even better. I have used it on carpet (no stains!) and bedding with excellent results.I have also used Bac-Out to wipe down walls and it eliminated ""smoker smell"" from an apartment I moved into. I buy it in bulk and use it often. I love this product so much, I've even shared it with friends."
3,Another ho-hum basic pool book,"Like many books of this sort, it is out of print, and for a good reason: It's been supplanted by much more in-depth works, such as Play Your Best Pool and Byrne's Standard Book of Pool. That said, there's certainly nothing wrong with this book. It covers the key basics, and gives some excellent, time-tested practice drills to hone skills. The whole second half of the book is dedicated to trick shots, which are entertaining of course. (Me, I tend to look for applicable, game-improving information in my pool books, so this one was a little disappointing. Others with a real penchant for trick shots will probably find it more interesting.)"
3,"Good machine, but arrived crippled","I've owned the ze4230 for about a month and I have been very pleased with it's features and performance, but it arrived with a non functioning CD/RW CDROM drive. The Roxio Easy CD Creator disk sent with the machine is defective and I have been unable to enable the RW features of the CDROM drive. I reported the problem to HP technical support and was promised a new CD by mail within a week. After waiting about 2 weeks without receiving a new CD I called technical support again and was told that the CDs are on back order and they have no idea when they will arrive, but when they do one will be sent me. So, for now I am less than pleased with my computer and HPs ability to fix it."
5,Heartfelt pain for all,"This book is one of the best I have read on the War. It shows all the pain, grief, tears and empty stomachs that combat brings. It shows how fruitless the war was. Now we have Ford and GM plants running in the old combat zone and only some of us still feel the pain of an American blood soaked land where countless were wounded in body and in mind. But we can count the ones gone, all their names are listed on the wall. Many of us will always remember them, but our profiteers will only count the dollars earned not the men lost. I highly recommend this book."
2,The book fails to present the strength of the enlisted men.,"The enlisted men fought the war and Mr. Carhart fails to devliver that message in his book. I served with the 1/327(6/67-6/68) and remember the courage, care, concern for each other and resourcefulness of the soldiers. To read this book you will never know the closeness the soldiers in the front line felt for one another. This book fails to detail the many heroic moments the different combat platoons had in saving one another from one fight to another. Some of the hardest battles were fought in 67-68 and this book does not do justice to the men who fought the battles nor to some of the fine officers we had to lead us . The book attempts to put down African American soldiers and does not adequately address the many contributions of African American officers and NCO's in the 1/327. I disliked the book for the falsehoods and innuendos Mr. Carhart used and the lack of respect he pays my fallen comrades."
5,Great Daily Supplement,I attribute Nature's Bounty Cider Vinegar Tablets to my husband's reduction of plaque build-up in his arteries. He had a 20% reduction in one artery after having been on this supplement for about 6 months. It also helps curb your appetite. I would highly recommend this product. I certainly hope that Amazon will carry this product again with free shipping.
4,Effective but Pungent!,"I have to take a stomach-acid reducer due to acid reflux, so I have trouble with digestion. I got these tablets to give me a shot of acid with my meals. And so far I have noticed a significant decrease in after-meal indigestion. However, I find the vinegar odor too strong when I open the bottle. While the tablets are strong-flavored, as well, I can swallow them quickly enough not to be bothered by the taste. When it comes time for me to reorder, I plan to switch to a capsule, which I expect will greatly reduce the odor."
3,UMMMM LOSE WEIGHT WHAT?,HAVE NOT SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN WEIGHT.I HAVE USED DOLLAR TREE PILLS VINEGAR AND THEY WORKED THIS NOT SOO MUCH.VERY STRONG GIVES YOU ACID IN THROAT.VERY SAD ABOUT THIS
2,Hidden information!!!,"I just want to say, that this provider doesn't provide enough information about the supplements facts, in this case this bottle contains:Calcium....... 116mg..... 12%Phosphorus.... 88mg..... 9%Apple Cider V. 600mg.....so, I don't know how Calcium and Phosphorus can affect my health system??????"
1,Hack writing for NA/Mormon Church,"I intially purchased this book because of the title, i thought that it might be a good look into the rave scene and a person's story about it. instead i found a poorly written, uninspiring, pity piece. As someone who has experienced the same scene in the SF Bay and recovered on my own i feel that this book is a let down on all fronts. It does not adequetely describe the dangers and the pleasures of the scene. It does a horrid job of explaining the come down, being etarded. And it is a propaganda piece for the Church of LDS. It is great that this kid transcribed his experiences for people but should not be read by anyone over 14 or somewhat intelligent."
4,so good for the price,This drum has a very punchy tight sound and I was very surprised by its response for just how cheap it was if your rock drumming on a budget I highly recommend it
3,Simple Fun Game,"Bought this game over a yer ago. It's a fun game in the beginning, but then I realized the controls and the mechanics of the game could be a whole lot better. It's a good mindless game to kill some time with some friends if you're bored."
1,Major disappointment!,"If you really want to learn about the life of Florence Nightingale, buy a biography and skip this tape. Neither the content nor the presentation is worth investing your time and money. The production is visually dull; the timing is static; and the script provides little useful information. There are many assertions made about Nightingale's work and importance but they are not backed up with explanations, details, etc. Useless!"
5,gaithers,I own alot of Bill Gaithers dvd's and cd's. He is a very talented man with such a wonderful gift of putting people together to sing songs with such grace. I love everyone who sings with him.
3,Write Bands,"I used these as part of a pro wrestling Halloween costume. Not the best quality, but a nice added touch."
3,It's for my 3 yr Grandson - He likes trains :),"Gosh, I thought that the Transformer was a great idea. It's ok, my 3 yr old Grandson likes trains - if fact he loves it. Yep, it's all good."
5,A hit with my son,I don't have much to say other than the shipping was ahead of schedule and my son loves to play with it.
2,Looks can be deceiving,"My 3 year old son loved the way this toy looked, but if you do not keep the instructions it is hard to put back together as the train. He doesn't play with it nearly as much as I thought he would. It actually just sits in his room. He plays with his other Power Rangers a lot more. Maybe because he is only 3, but I'm not quite sure. The train also does not stay together when he tries to push it along the floor or table so he gets frustrated. Hope this helps."
1,Sooooo useless,"Very, very little value in this book. Literally half could apply to any city because it's a bunch of lame general parenting tips. An example, here are the ""Seven Principles of Living with Kids in Manhattan""1) Know what works for you2) Plan ahead3) Never take more than you want to carry4) Make sure that you and anyone caring for your children is equipped to handle an emergency5) Safety first6) Too much of a good thing can be too much7) Attitude is everythingThanks a lot, we parents in San Francisco don't have to worry about planning or safety!The other half of this book is a series of lists. Here's a list of *all* the museums in NYC! And one of all the kids stores (including Barnes & Nobles and Bloomingdales, thanks for the tips!). Zero commentary on *anything* just a bunch of lists. Seriously this book is like the output of a list of google searches paired with some generic parenting tips. Worthless!"
1,TOTALLY USELESS,"Not only is the information in this book ""outdated"" it was useless when it was published. It isn't even relevant to the niche marketthey're both in ... nyc privileged stay at home moms who have a couple of kids with a household of help so they write a book so they can say they are authorsDo not waste time or money on this one and don't give it as a shower gift"
4,Canadian--but still Hot!,"I'm confused.Heh.Jacynthe is undoubtably attractive but it is her voice that will shine. Yes, she was great on her last albums, but here--as with some of her Christmas album (25*25)--she truely sounds like a woman. No more of that wise-for-her-years teenager stuff; here Jacynthe breaks through.Yes, the album is short, but not by much, seeing as the average album nowdays has ten songs. And unlike those, every song on Seize The Day is catchy and enjoyable, be they slow or fast.I'm not sure how well STD has done, but hopefully the distributors of Jacynthe's previous--and very OOP--albums will be encouraged to rerelease them; and she will get some better opportunities.(Casting her as the lead in the Canadian Simple Life was a step in the right direction). Heck, at least give the girl a reason to update her darn website."
5,Excellent Book,"This is a great book for all VB Distributed App developers. Its clearly written, easily understandable and gets straight to the point.Also the examples are nice and clear - not 100 lines of sample code to demonstrate a simple point, unlike Microsoft help files.Whilst there is a wealth of beginner books there are very few good books beyond this level - but this is one of them.If you have a year of more VB experience and you develop distributed apps then buy this book."
1,Distributed COM Application Development Using Visual Basic 6,"Very poor book. A lot of useless for VB programmer theory; several chapters on VB controls and technics that have no connection to the book topic - Distributed COM; too little about MTS, nothing practical about Distributed COM without MTS."
4,Awesome series,"A time-travel romance junky, I found this series by accident (misshelved at the library!). I couldn't put either of the first two books down, and am eagerly waiting to get to the third. Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series still reigns #1 with me, but this series is a solid 2nd place. My fiance hates time travel fiction because of scientific improbabilities, but that didn't happen with these, and he loved them! Don't start the book if you don't have several hours to kill."
4,A ton of fun!,"I loved this idea!! How much fun could you have going back in time and seeing certain things or doing certain things? Most people have said that ""If I could only go back, with what I know now."" What if you could? I think that Joshua Dann did an awesome job of bringing this book to life. I wished that it could have gone on and on with diffrent adventures."
4,"Great reading, but a little disjointed","As escapist fiction, this book is a good way to while away a few hours. Although I had a little trouble with a few areas, such as the development of character background (Ch. 2) and the way the story seems to have a 'deus ex machina' feel to it. There is one question I have that was not addressed in this book, but may or may not be addressed in future books: ""What will happen when there are too many people to account for having been in one place at one time?"" The main story is the introduction to time travel for John Surrey, ex-LAPD detective who now works for Timeshare. The story jumps from an ongoing investigation by a Senate subcommittee to John's first exploit in time in which he meets Althea Rowland, the woman he falls in love with.As the story goes on, he gets involved in some intrigue and other escapades. As I said in the title of this review, there is a somewhat disjointed plot line, but like the movie ""Pulp Fiction"", it does come together at the end."
5,Let's go to the zoo.,"My son loves this zoo. It is a very fun and educational toy. It reinforces animal sounds, teaches what different animals eat, and where different animals can live. He enjoys pretending to be the zoo-keeper and ""feeding"" the animals or giving them rides on his car. My only complaint. My son tends to be a little over-zealous with his toys (i.e. rough). If he bangs them together or against other things, they tend to get marked up easily. That is something I haven't experienced with our other Little People sets."
3,Couldn't you get better animal sounds?,"This is a really cute toy & my son likes the noises, my only complaint is that the animal sounds could be more true to sound. Instead they recorded a person making the sound. The lion is especially bad. Seriously it is a man going rrrrrraaahhhh. My son seems to like the monkey the best, which also has the best sound."
3,This is my 2 yo son's least favorite Little People toy...,"and we just got it a couple of weeks ago! I really hesitated about buying this toy...my son loves playing pretend with little people but I worried that this toy did not offer enough for him to imagine with. I was right. He played with it a lot for a few days and has gone back to playing with his other little people toys. Hopefully my infant daughter will enjoy it some when she is older and learning about animals. I'm sure my son will play with this toy again but not as much as his barnyard, garage, bus and firetruck."
3,Too expensive for little thrills,The little people toys are great and cute and some even very educational but this one isn't the best. The parts get lost easily and it chews through batteries. When we got this toy it ended up getting shoved aside and the animals that came with it are now bath toys. In my opinion there isn't much to do and once you push all the buttons a few dozen times it loses it's appeal quickly and doesn't get played with as often anymore. My daughter is one that plays with all of her toys equally and goes back to the oldies that she has and my step son is the same way but this one fell to the bottom of the toy box not to be seen in 6 months.
5,Great toy for all ages!,"I just bought this toy a few days ago to keep at my house for my... twin nephews. I babysit them and another... boy and they all loved playing with this toy. I was looking for a toy that would be safe and fun for the babies and fun for the toddler too. This definitely fit the bill! They especially love the growls of the lion and polar bear and mimic them, as well as the elephant sound too. I plan on getting the additional baby zoo animals for them too, but the store I bought it at didn't have it. I would highly recommend this to anyone! And I love that the sounds aren't too loud or obnoxious, that's really important to me when buying toys. I can listen to this toy all day and it doesn't get on my nerves."
4,Great toy for any age,"I just got this toy for my 9 month old son. He loves animals. He loves all the sounds that the animals make. Most of them seem some what real, EXCEPT for the Lion and Polar are just some guy roaring. He really likes the animals and their sounds. I have playing with him."
3,My son enjoys the zoo,My son likes this toy. He spends a lot of time with the toy and even though the bird drives me crazy in particular he really gets a kick out of it and isn't that what it's all about?
4,Love the Zoo,"We bought this for my 1 year old and while she really loves to play with it, she gets bored quickly. She'd rather walk around with the little people in her mouth. I think as she gets older, it will be a great learning tool for her. The Zoo is just precious."
1,Boring,"There is not much to do for my curious two year-old. He can make the monkey jump, open and close the pens, push the car around. The animal sounds are shrill and after pressing the buttons a few times my son lost interest. So, after five minutes of play, he never touched it again. He does love the animals, but the zoo is useless. The garage is so much more fun!"
5,Hours of fun,We have had this toy for several months and it is played with daily by both my 4 year old and 9 month old. The baby loves the animals and has even figured out on his own how to activate the animal sounds. The kids love it - one of the best toys Fisher Price has made! Highly recommended!
1,You Have Got to Be Kidding...,"This book is insipid. I'm a fan of horror, sci-fi and the like and this book is neither. The plot is vapid and the characters are completely underdeveloped. The author lacks the most basic descriptive powers. If I didn't live in NYC, I believe I would find the story's geography hard to follow. Stay away from this silly book."
3,This novel *could* end up as a great movie.,"After reading Rovin's excellent Return of the Wolfman novel, I picked up Vespers. While not quite as great as the Wolfman book, Vespers provides the reader with some genuine chills. That is, of course, if you are not fond of bats. I really enjoyed how the characters were believeable- with flaws. Mistakes are made by characters throughout the book, but that just makes them more credible to me. I also liked the portrayal of women in the book. My only small complaint about the book was that at times Rovin's research found its way into the storyline in a forced fashion.Since Vespers is destined to become a movie, I would suggest the filmmakers to screen 'The Birds' and 'The Relic' before going to work. Use 'The Birds' as an example of what to do, and use 'The Relic' as a guide at what *not* to do. I'll be first in line to grab a ticket."
4,Great Beach Book,"I really had a good time with this book. Sure, the romance angle was a bit out of place. But what a hoot to have Manhattan attacked by big bats. The details of that alone are worth the read. I have recommended this book to many people and they all game it a thumbs up."
1,What a disappointment!,"As I get older I've come to resent anything that is a waste of time. This book falls in that category. It was poorly written, uninformed, unbelievable and generally dull. The high point of the book was in the first few pages when a 600-plus pound deer is found dead up in a tree. As a devoted white-tailed deer watcher I can only imagine what a magnificent specimen this was. Truly a North American record-sized animal. Unfortunately the author would have us believe that 600 pounds is the average size of a full-grown deer. It went downhill from there."
2,An okay read but somewhat predictable and lacking suspense.,"A combination of ""The Relic"", ""Ben"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Ghostbusters"" but lacking in true terror, suspense, or interest. The author has taken tried and true plot lines and replaced the protagonists with bats. There is some chemistry between the two main characters but, other than this, much of the action is predictable and the writing wooden and simplistic. Some good information about how bats live, mate, and feed was provided but if you are looking for a good horror or suspense story, this is not it."
3,BAT - MANIA,"I thought the story was simplistic, the characters completely unimaginative, the action scenes with the bats was very well written. You can tell the author was concerned more about the action scenes than he was for the rest of the story. Giant bats a little hard to swallow. I can see where this will make for an interesting movie, since the book pretty much reads like a movie. All in all a fun read."
3,A fun read for Horror fans.,"Vespers, with its irresistable swarm of killer bats, is the kind of horror novel that you won't want to put down. The climactic ending is both exciting and original. Like many horror novels, however, the characters are not really developed enough for the reader to care what happens to them."
3,Not high quality,"This is not a high quality tap and die set. I thoroughly examined every tap and die and remove some small bits of non-detached meterial. One of the taps were defective, having two joined grooves (due that a I'm not from usa, the trouble of return was not worth). Also, tap wrenches and die stocks are rough finished. But for the price, its OK, and still cool."
1,Misleading,"I was looking for a travel bag that had various compartments to put your personal grooming items in. The item description says ""Features special compartments"" which is not the case at all. The bag is flimsy and has one plastic pouch on one side. Definitely not worth the price."
4,decent showing,"It doesn't begin to match the energy of Oil and Gold, but what the hell, that was forever ago, at least they're back. The package is a much mellower funky collection of well done though not entirely memorable songs."
4,Solid new material,"Those new to Shriekback should not probably start here, but for fans this is a solid set of new material. While the first half is stronger than the second, all the tracks are enjoyable and exhibit the band's typical craftsmanship and attention to detail. Since the band is basically just Barry Andrews and Martyn Barker at this point, expect material that slots in with ""Naked Apes & Pond Life"" and ""Glory Bumps""."
5,In the Midst of Winter: Selections from the Literature of Mourning,"This compilation of poems about mourning helped me more than any other book on the subject in the year after my husband died. The author, a poet and widow herself, has chosen works both contemporary and ancient, covering every kind of loss and phase of mourning.I have given copies of it to many others in the same situation."
4,In the midst of the pages,"I have given this book to many people in the midst of grieving and loss. It has never failed to help. Each recipient has found solace and even strength between the pages. Perhaps it was merely that someone cared and wished to help assuage the unspeakable anguish. One person said the chapters unfurled like a soft blanket. Who knows? Who really cares? The very real people suffering the same losses cared enough to put their thoughts on paper. It obviously helped them through dark times, and so it can be passed along."
5,A bizarre and wild ride through a vampire's life,"The Last Vampire chronicles the life of Elmo Land, the last vampire living at the actual end of times. His story begins in the twenties when he becomes the victim of a neighborhood woman who happens to be a vampire. His story is a rather unique one. He tells his angst-ridden tale that somehow seems much fresher than most of the horror novels out there. He is neither fancy nor debonair but a very real character dealing with an insatiable hunger. Elmo tells the story of cowboy vampires and his journey as an undead killer. Its a great tale that never disappoints. Its funny, its frightening and most of all, its an odd story full of interesting characters. Great"
3,Don't confuse this with Streiber,"If you pick up this book based totally on title, you might think you're getting something great (novel with the same title by Whitley Streiber), and you're really getting a middle of the road, forgettable book.Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst book i've ever read about vampires, but it's also not in the top 100. If you cut out the complete paragraphs that are repeated throughout the novel (meant to illustrate the degeneration of the mind of the title character), you're left with about 125 pages of middle of the road prose.The ""Midnight Rodeo"", with which the novel really begins, was a GREAT idea that wasn't developed and dropped out of the story after five pages. A rodeo that was performed at night, in which all of the ""cowboys"" were actually vampires... too bad that wasn't developed."
5,Start here- what is mathematics?,"I am updating this review, original one is below the dotted line.Keith Devling takes us through a grandiose tour de force on the question wahts is mathematics, by starting from its originis as the ""sceince of numbers .. and space"" a concept that is 2.300 years old and was the one I had in my mind, until Mr.Devling noted it was a bit dated.This book does call for some sort of sophistication form the reader. It is not atextbook, so some of the examples and invitation to solve certain problems (such as to discover Aristotle's logic mistakes by using Boolean algebra) are a bit challenging to the unitiated.The graphics and examples of mathematical explanations abound, and just for this the book is worth it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Its from Scientific American, its written by K. Devlin, its wonderfully ilustrated.. what more can you expect?!Yes its math explained"
3,OK,"This book has a lot of good information along with some excellent illustrations.It is undoubtedly a very good book for one who is a great lover of mathematics. It is not, however, a book that is difficult to put down. It did not captivate me and convince me about all I am missing by not being a math junkie."
4,Great discovery!,An artist friend of mine brought me to see this documentary and I didn't know what to expect.What a great surprise it was!Loved it from start to finish!Got the dvd and even got the book of photographs of all the faces that sat in front of Marina.I am now a huge fan and this dvd will make you one too.
4,"Great episodes, great value","Kintaro Oe, college drop out (despite receiving enough credits to graduate) travels Japan on his bike partaking in part time jobs and furthering his education in life.This is some seriously funny stuff. Kintaro's jobs always involve a cute girl who gets in trouble or gets him into trouble. In the first episode he was the trouble. His facial expressions and voice are the greatest. Quality animation. Plenty of sexual humor in this title cuases people to swear by it or swear at it.Treasure Hunt contains the first three dubbed Golden Boy episodes for the price of one tape. Quite a bargain.Please check the individual titles for a more detailed review."
5,Excellent notebook,"I'm very pleased with this notebook. Excellent DVD playing, and very nice sound quality. For those of you who like using your laptop to watch DVDs and listen to music, you'll be pleased with the results of this one. Good processing speed. Isn't exactly a P4, but is enough for daily tasks such as word processing, e-mail, internet, etc. Oh, a nice extra that this comes with is the very cool, very unique blue lights at the top of the keyboard and on the power button and the task bar down at the bottom. Better than a Mac design..much.. Overall, this is a good notebook and worth buying."
4,Good computer,"Have had it for 3.5 years now, and only have replaced the battery. It is a great computer for a person at college, or for a personal user. It is a good buy! Great price I paid 500 for it new! I recomend this product."
1,NOT for children,"We are fairly strict about media intake for our children, but we do allow an occasional non-fiction production. My children are very interested in animals of all types, so I figured this would go over very well.Content to which I object: There are multiple images and references to witches - scenes from a Shakespeare play made to movie of a witch concocting a potion... very scary image, bony hands, bulgy eyes, wild hair, creaky voice. Then another witch scenario came on in a few minutes. Finally scenes from the movie ""Dracula"" were inserted complete with dracula raising his head from biting someone's neck while the announcer went on about him drinking blood. At that point we cut it off. IMO, the makers of this film have an agenda which is a far cry from educating children about amphibians."
4,Just what I expect from this UK smoothjazz group,"If you like smooth vocals, a busy horn section and some FUNK, then you will like CD from Incognito. It seems as though they have added more vocals than usual to this CD but for the most part I enjoyed all of them. This group has a way of making jazz funky and I tapped my foot all day long while driving a short road trip. A great listen."
4,Absolutely Wonderful,Eleven was my first Incognito record and it won't be my last. Love it. I am no music critic but I know good music when I hear it and this is GOOD MUSIC.
3,Eleven - Incognito,"One of the weaker albums overall for Incognito. The first few songs start off well but drag on with an incoherent finish. Jacaranda is my favorite, that is done well in the Roy Ayers tradition. Most Incongito albums have songs that blow the listener away in albums (100 Degrees and Rising, No Time Like the Future, Adventures in Black Sunshine). It is hard to articulate, but the production was not up to standard, especially in last half of the album. The last song, ""As Long as it is You,"" is a nice ballad but somehow is not totally right."
1,Disappointed...,"After hearing and completely enjoying ""Aventures in Black Sunshine""- this CD was a letdown. Maybe I need to revisit it after reading the previous reviews?"
5,Just Great!,Good melodies and groove. You will not be disappointed. Forgive me for not writing lenghty but this ranks among the bests of the Incognito albums I have (and I have most of them!)
5,We love this tape!,"We were given this tape as a gift, because my husband wanted our little girl (age 2 1/2) to learn Italian, even though we don't speak it. She loves it! She gets excited when the opening music starts and the kids start popping up, and imitates the words and sentences throughout the tape.(Her current favorite is, ""Quanti bambole? Otto bambole!"" (how many dolls? 8 dolls!) which I've actually heard her repeating to herself as she plays with her own dolls. I'm amazed, and proud. This is a great video, and I've just ordered French and Japanese from the same series."
1,Murder of Nutcracker,"This is the most horrible version of the Nutcracker I have ever seen. Leave it to the French to screw up a beautiful ballet like that. If you like modern, jumping around, half naked performances, then you may like this but for me it is a waste of time. I like opera too and the French versions of operas are as bad. So, in my opinion, don't waste your money."
1,From Back Cover,"As the ""princess"" of Belle Rive, Mississippi, Amber Logan can have any man she wants. However, she wants sweet talking Logan Van Dell only. Logan is very attracted to the beautiful eighteen year old Amber. However, he knows that anything long-term is doomed because her parents would never allow her to go with a social loser like Logan.6th in the Sweet Talkin' Guys series"
4,Wonderful - Great rainy day lunch!,"I buy these for my elderly grandfather who needs to watch his salt and fat intake. He loves them and I know he is eating lunch everyday because they are easy for him to manage.The only down side is that he is used to just opening and consuming whatever the container size is - and according to the package label, this bowl constitutes 2 servings. So when you read the nutrition information, keep in mind everything is DOUBLE if you eat the whole bowl..."
5,Perfect,Good soup - taste just like the canned healthy choice. Easy to use and is plump full with noodles and chicken!
1,Beware - Soup explodes in microwave,"Not a good soup for the microwave. Something in the soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues. I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel. Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave."
1,Upset,"I purchased this because on the picture of the soup it says ""Old Fashion"" chicken noodle, where the noodles are thick and flat, this is what I wanted and I got just regular chicken noodles with the rotini noodles. I haven't been able to find the ""old fashioned"" kind in my grocery stores so when I saw the picture of this one, this is why I ordered it and it is not it."
2,Broth is tasty but....,"I was extremely disappointed in this soup. There were, at most, six or seven noodles and maybe five or six hunks of chicken. It was mostly broth. I had to salt it a little but not much. The broth really was very tasty but if I want to drink broth with less meat than a chicken wing, I will buy some Swanson's broth in a box."
3,healthy choice soup,"This is not ""home made"" soup; nor is it gourmet. However, it hasa reasonably good taste for ""canned"" soup, and the packaging doesmake it very convenient. Indeed, the packaging is more impressive.However, on a cold night, when in a hurry, or for a quick lunch thatis hot and reasonably healthy, it is a good choice. I would buythis again."
1,Not that great!,"Quite frankly, we think this soup is disgusting. There is no flavor to it whatsoever, and if I accidentally buy it, hoping a different flavor will be better, my husband (who eats ANYTHING!) just groans and chokes it down. The only thing good about it is that it does have more ""stuff"" in it to fill you up, but just no taste. After you dump about a pound of salt into them, they resemble something with some flavor, but not really. It's healthy all right, but there are many other products out there that are just as healthy but have all the flavor as well. If you don't like spices, then this is your soup. However, since I make my own and we're more used to flavor, this one just doesn't cut the broth."
3,Replacement dress watch,"The watch is attractive and relatively easy to use. It keeps accurate time, but that is to be expected. For the price, it compares very favorably to more expensive 'atomic' watches.However, seeing the status of whether the watch received the atomic signal and re-synced is hard. The codes are not intuitively obvious. It would be nice to have an alarm or time signal function similar to most digital watches."
2,Looks good but doesn't work right,"I was so excited for it to ""automatically"" update, but it has never done so. It sets the time about 20 minutes fast and cannot get the hang of daylight savings time (I guess because it changes every year?)"
3,"Good, unexpensive watch","For the price this is a good watch. It keeps good time and is easy to see with ""old"" eyes. The functions are a bit mystifying and I'm am always fumbling with them. Luckily once it is set you do not have to mess with the settings very often."
2,I am not happy with the product,It's doesn't look like as it appears in the photos...i bought it to gift my husband and i wz very disappointed !! I returned it back !!
3,Under the Umbrella of Mother,"This novel was quick and easy to read. It really is the story of a woman's relationships based on the life of her mother, Evelyn, a successful and popular publisher of a book review which is prominent in New York City. I was to the middle of the novel when I stopped to ask when the stories about the main character, Mary Forrest were going to start. They were nuanced in there but not really the focus of the novel. The best thing about the novel is the voice of Evelyn, Mary's mom. You can really hear what she could be in real life through the author's dialogue. You get a good sense of her New York/Greenich Village lifestyle, too. Not my favorite, but a tidy nugget of a book."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed by this book. E. Stanley Jones is a favorite author of mine. This book was obviously written by an 87 year old man within an editor. It not only has typos, misuse of words, but in many places it is reduntant. There are gems buried in this poorly written book, but most of them have already appeared in The Word Become Flesh.Having great confidence in Jones I ordered three copies knowing I would want to pass them along to my friends. Anyone want a free copy?"
3,A very hard read.,The book is very dated from the stand point of vocabulary and proper grammar by today's standards. Mr. Jones is very repetitious. Might have been the style in the 1950's. However the subject matter is well covered sis shed some light on what Kingdom is.
5,Every Christian Should Read,"Amazing book. Next tp the Bible I cannot recall another book that has impacted my faith, theology, and beliefs - each page was as though the Holy Spirit was turning the page. For the committed Christian, this is a must read - because E Stanley Jones, at 87 years old, writes a clear and precise message of what is important about our faith. I thought the first 50 pages were a little slow but then I could not put it down - although I must confess, every 3-10 pages I would have to stop and absorb, think, and pray. It was too much clarity. I felt like the blinds of religion were being taken off my eyes and life. I recommended this book to family, friends, and you. You will not be disappointed. God bless..."
5,One of the only authors that can keep me up for hours,I first started reading these book while i was in the Navy and boy does Marcinco hit dead on with his military oppinions (actually fact). these books will keep you wanting more to come. the only thing i cant figure is why this set cost over$200 for a set of papaerbacks hmm go figure.
1,Hard to finish!!!,"It took me a month to finish this book! Usually I am more than willing to stay up all night to finish a Jude Deveraux book. (I LOVED ""Rememberance""!!!) For every few pages from ""The Heiress"" that I was able to make myself read, I would put the book down and take a few days break. The book was hard for me to get interested in, but I forced myself to finish it because it was a Jude Deveraux book. I think the surprise ending made up for the rest of the book, but I would not recommend getting this just for that. Do yourself a favor and borrow it from the library. You'll satisfy your curiosity without feeling stupid about paying for this book."
5,A KEEPER,"My first book by Ms. Devereaux was VElvet promise, and I loved it. But I have to say that this one is by far the best. No strange plot, cruel villains. Only a fun and sweet story. I love all Montgomerys, but Jamie has something special. He is caring and sweet. And Axia is not a typical heroine. She is smart but at the same time innocent. And, well all characters are great. My favourite of course is Tode.The book starts with a funny scene between Jamie and his sisters, you will LOL. And the love scene between Jamie and ""Diane"" is beautiful. If you need a book for a long winter afternoon you will be not disapointed. My only regret is that is too short, but it worths your money. I hope Frances will have her own story she is a nice girl after all."
2,Disappointing,"At the start of the book the characters seemed interesting and varied. But it didn't take long at all before the inconsistancies started to grate on my nerves. How does a woman who has been sheltered and locked away for her entire life know enough about the outside world to pose and then act as a prostitute.Why does everyone in the book think the hero is loyal and a man of honor when he breaks his word to the man who hired him by becoming engaged to his daughter, while at the same time courting another and holding the keepsake of another to his heart. He is a pig.Finally the twists at the end of the book are ridiculous. I could believe that a character might change a little by the end of the book. But to go as far as the author did here made me want to throw the book against the wall."
3,Great Set-up/disappointing finish,"I've just discovered Jude Deveraux and have been rapidly devouring all her books I can find. The premise, the hero, heroine and supporting characters were original and entertaining...the handsome, honorable, yet desperate hero who must marry for money to save his family's home and lands attempts to woo the remote beautiful ""heiress"" but slowly falls in love with her outspoken, passionate and trouble-making ""cousin."" Add a blind sister for the hero, a physically deformed yet loyal and courageous ""jester"" friend of the heroine--and you should have a fascinating mix of characters to work with. And Ms. Deveraux does a great job with them--until about the last 100 pages when it seems that either a deadline or an idea for her next book was demanding that she tie everything up as quickly as possible without regard for keeping her characters acting in character. This otherwise great book deserves a better thought-out resolution of the original conflicts."
3,Pass on this one...,"Personally, I don't like my men stupid, and Jamie Montgomery is stupid. I couldn't STAND to read about him. Axia is really better off with her sterile intended, end of story."
3,A twisted homage to Mervyn Peake.,"If you've never read the Gormenghast books (and you should), you'll only be getting half a book, in my opinion. The prose is florid and descriptive to an extreme, a la Peake, and the great palace of Gloriana is a debauched, sensual version of Peake's Gormenghast. The fact that the book is dedicated to Peake pretty much spells out what Moorcock started with, but his vision is far more colorful and far more savage.The turgid style make for tough going, and Moorcock goes out of his way to portray most of the characters as larger-than-life melodramatic poseurs (with a twisted edge). Not for those easily offended, but nonetheless enjoyable as a Baroque romp by an author known for his occasional forays into trashy fantasy."
5,Fine embroidery with words,"Gloriana, queen of Albion, was born of rape from tainted stock. Taller, wiser, more beautiful and more kind than all other mortals-- she lacks the ability to find sexual (emotional) completion.Captain Quire is an artist of evil, who seeks an appreciative patron for his finest works.Quire is bidden to weaken Albion and force the queen to marry and sets about it with his usual skill. But Gloriana is no ordinary opponent, and whether the two of them will find destruction or redemption in each other becomes the crux of the novel.Moorcock clearly delights in detail-- historial Elizabethan era, with the tiny twists that make it an alternative universe. Decadence, Dr. Dee, automatons, travelers from other realities, court seasons and public poetry make up the stage-setting which is almost more compelling than the story itself."
2,"Yes, unfufilled","I read this becuase my husband's a devoted Moorcock fan (they're on first name terms- isn't this internet thing amazing?) I'll diplomatically say it's just not my cup of tea - there are just too many lists of fabrics, metals, walls that makes the prose unwieldy. I did love the fact that the most powerful character was a woman - exaggerated, but still human and I can't actively dislike a book that concludes that a really good orgasm is good for queen and country. So much SF/ fantasy (especially back when this was written) seemed to be written by men who'd never actually met a real live woman, so I'm impressed by 'Mike's' fem cred."
1,blah blah blah,I enjoy historical fiction books a great deal BUT this one is sooo boring. I will be reading it and realize that I haven't been paying attention to the past 2 or 3 paragraphs because it is such a snoozer. I really hate it when authors feel the need to describe every little detail about someone's clothing after a while it really starts to take away from the story. I find myself skimming through the page just to find something interesting to read. I was really excited when I bought this book but was extremely disappointed.
2,Moorcock's worst book.,"The title character is supposed to be an alternate world version of Queen Elizabeth, yet she has none of Elizabeth's cruelty, cunning or sheer personality. Instead Gloriana is a sap being constantly manipulated by one advisor or the other. Not even the movie version of Elizabeth portrayed her as such a wimp.There is some interesting secondary characters especially the artist/conspiricist/assassin Quire, but the references made to various earths and albinos only serve to remind the reader how far Moorcock strays from The Eternal Champion and how short he falls from something original. The former is variety, the latter is tragic."
1,Some Things Are Best Left Behind...This Is One,"The bizarre adventures of a cardiac victim are fashioned from his seemingly endless ability to fix everything except his own relationships. None of this, including the dime-novel sex, works. Ira Foxglove will waste your time as much as he did mine. Imagine floating across the Atlantic Ocean in an airship after disentangling your runaway wife from her lover by threatening to run him down with a motor scoter you fixed. Of course, you only would do this after a hearty round of sex with your daughter's dancing partner. Ira hopes to leverage that with a tomato sex-toy whose properties seemingly could produce an external heart machine. Dream on; tune out."
1,A kids review,"I really, really disliked this book. I had to read it for a bookclub and It was one of the most boring books i ever read. It took me forever to finish. It has boring, typical characters and i pretty much predicted the whole book. I think they were trying to be a good writer by repeating stupid things like ""i almost touched a whale"" as symbolism, (really??) but i thought it was just annoying. It took me FOREVER to read this book and I couldn't get into it at all, it was mostly 4 or 5 events repeating over and over!!!! UGGHH!! I suggesst you nOT read this book"
3,Lizzie Bright Review,"I bought this book for class. It was very well written. The ending was hard to deal with, but it was excellent and a good background to the history of Malaga Island. I would suggest this for anyone who likes a good read. This also good for educators to introduce race relations in Maine."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I carry my agenda with me every where. I am a student and wanted an academic year monthly calendar this size. The only academic year calendars I could find in the stores were daily/monthly or much bigger. This was exactly what I wanted! Plus, it is an 18 month calendar, which will make it very easy to buy a monthly calendar in 18 months because I will need a new one in January 2001."
4,Good with tweaks,"A calendar that works with some visual adaptations required such as opening the booklet entirely since the days go straight across both pages rather down one and then down the next. Could use some lines here and there for notes since I write in an inky manner, not quite linear. But the type of calendar that I have been waiting for, ripping out the pages of comic-book characters that I do not care about. Rather have the room for time and space."
4,Pretty Good,"I think this book of short stories has a pretty good collection, but I think that the onlky place where this book she probaly be read is in school. THrere are many symbolisms in it and I think student need a teacher to guide them through it"
2,Speed Bag Platform is Worthless,"I got this for Christmas from my wife as part of a bundle that included a top-end heavy bag. With that in mind, it's a sufficient heavy bag stand. It's too tall to go into most basements though, which is a huge downer. It is just under 8 feet tall so you have to put it in between the joists to get it to fit.As for the speed bag platform... it is a complete wreck. You can't build up any speed at all because the drum (big round wood piece) is super flimsy attached to the bar. I literally can't get more then 1 hit off because the speed just dies.If you don't care about the speed bag, then if you get a deal it's worth it. If you care about the speed bag, keep looking."
2,never could get it to work right,"I wanted the microfiber towel but the beauty shop I was in didn't have it, just this head wrap. I tried for a few weeks but couldn't get it to work satisfactorily, so I took it back in. The clerk showed me how to use it, though, and I tried again but it still had the problems of it being unwieldy and too tight that others have reported.Trying to make it a towel, I then attempted to remove the elastic, but it's sewn in, so I just chopped the blasted thing apart and use it as a strange, star-shaped towel."
3,Sort-of gets the work done,This product works just a bit better than using a regular bath towel. The only good thing about it is that it's lighter than a regular towel and doesn't move around.
3,Interestng Invention,This is not a bad product but it didn't work for my purpose. I wanted to use it over curlers and it wasn't large or stretchy enough to be comfortable.
1,Great if you are bald!,"This product is extremely hard to put on your head. You have to put in on, twist it and then button it into a small loop on the back of your head. At that point, it slips back on your head and your hair falls out. My daughter was unable to get it to work properly either. I may return it, but with the price of return shipping, it's almost not worth it. I would be embarrassed to give it as a gift. I have purchased a microfiber hair towel from this same company and it works great but I would not recommend the hair turban at all."
3,"Microfiber is great, but wrapping the turban is tricky.","I have long hair (waist length, but thin). I prefer to air dry my hair, but that is just too uncomfortable in the winter, so I decided to try the turban.I love the microfiber. I believe it really does help my hair dry more quickly. Note, I said more quickly. Not necessarily quickly. I love that the turban holds my hair off of my neck and back. Ideally, it always does that. Realistically, while my hair all fits in the turban, wrapping it so I can button it, and it stays in place, is a pain! Really difficult for me to do (but maybe it's easier for more coordinated gals).I'd give the microfiber itself four stars, but because the turban is a hassle, I'm only giving this product three stars. If I needed another such product I'd just buy a microfiber towel."
1,Mimi's Diva Dryer Hair Turban,This product was a complete waste of money. I would have returned it if I could. It is no better than a towel and much more expensive.
3,"Good, but not different","I like this hair turban, but I actually prefer my cheaper ""Turbie Twist"" turbans from Bed Bath and Beyond. This is nice, but a lot more expensive and not worth it. The fabric is soft and it's bigger, but I have long hair and mine fits nicely in a Turbie Twist.Bottom line: Get a Turbie Twist."
1,not easy to use,"I had trouble getting this to fit on my head. It seemed small, even though I don't have a huge head. Twisting it and getting the button attached were a hassle. I'd be tempted to think it was my own lack of coordination, but I have no problems with the Twisty Towels I got at Bed Bath and Beyond. Also, the Twisty Towels were cheaper, and the fabric was just as nice.So, if you like a challenge and want to spend twice as much, then buy this product. Otherwise, try the Twisty Towels."
3,Just OK,"I like the material but these hair towels have way too much elastic. It actually makes them hard to control and presses on the ears. The little rope ring to loop on the button is on the inside!?1? Have to dig it out when your head is upside down, it makes no sense. OK, but no way the best ever as claimed."
5,A wonderful 'mistake',I purchased this product with the intention of having it handy for our many granddaughters visits. I already owned my own microfiber turban (another brand) and was satisfied...until...that turban was in the wash and I needed one to wrap my wet hair. WOW! What a difference! This is so superior to my other turban that I threw that one away and will purchase four or five of this brand to keep on hand for granddaughter visits!
5,The best hair turban ever!,"I've tried many different hair turbans, each claiming to be the fastest at drying your hair. I finally decided to purchase this one online, and I'm truly happiest with this product (I've returned all the other hair turbans). The Diva Dryer dries hair faster than other turbans, the material is very soft, and it cuts my morning routine time dramatically. It seems to help reduce frizz as well, perhaps because of less time using a hair dryer...Highly recommended product!"
3,"Not sure if it really works, but I'm using it anyway!","I can't really tell if this speeds my drying time at all. It is nice that it's smaller and doesn't weigh so heavy on my neck and shoulders. However, I am a little put-off by the lint debris problem! Everything on earth REALLY sticks to this towel, especially from the laundering process."
5,Save time in the morning,"This is a great addition to your morning routine to help save some time and get you out the door sooner. The hair turban is like an oversized, super absorbant shower cap. I have yet to master the ""technique"" of making the turban, so I resorted to placing my hair inside the cap, twisting the back and placing it on one side of my shoulder.Since this dries your hair more so than if you leave it air dry or keep it in a towel, I found that when I do then blow dry my hair, my hair feel more healthy and not as fried when I'm finished."
3,"I don't have a big head (literally), but","This wrap does dry your hair fast. The fabric is nice and looks like a regular towel. However, the instructions say to twist, twist, twist! your hair in the wrap then fasten the loop over the button closure behind your head. Impossible! The wrap would not nearly cover my head if I did this. Also, when twisting, the button goes all askew and I have to recenter it in order to fasten it. To fasten I can barley turn it just 1/4th a turn (just enough to hold my hair). This wouldn't exactly dry my hair if I didn't use it to remove excess moisture from my hair first, and it is too short to cover the front of my crown, no matter what I do.I do have long hair, maybe thats why.Another thing, the button started to come off in 2 days.If you have short hair, and are not a button abuser, this would probably be a solid product for you.I just didn't know such a simple thing could make life more complicated."
1,nice idea that doesnt work,"This is a nice idea that doesnt work at all. I bought this to have a small,light, neat way to keep my hair out of the way while using facial masks, bubble baths etc... but the thing wont stay on your head, it rides up so your hair is exposed, it pulls uncomfortably at the front of your hairline-- it's pretty useless.Stick to using a towel and save your money."
1,HORRIBLE! NOT WORTH IT!,"This is the worst product - I washed the turban ONCE (before I ever used it!) and the button fell off. I sewed it back on. I used the towel twice, and on the second try the loop snapped and so I can't use it at all anymore if I wanted to (it isn't large enough to just twist and tuck under). Horrible. Not to mention this doesn't work any better than a regular old towel. PLEASE don't waste your money!"
2,"Is it the turban, or just my head?","I have had microfiber hair turbans in the past and I must say that I am the least satisfied with this one. The elastic is constantly riding up and the turban just pops off my head. Maybe I have an odd shaped head. This product would be much better off without the elastic. I am thinking of trying to take it out somehow. It is basically useless to me. I would definitely go with the other ones. On the bright side, the packaging is really cute."
4,Great product!,"I really like the ""turban""- perfect after a shower on wet/damp hair. I thought I might not be coordinated enought to wrap it (!), but I figured it out quickly and now use it daily. I'll probably buy another one soon!"
1,Nothing special,"I bought this towel with the intention of using it turban style to ""plop"" my curly hair and dry it faster. The turban style is hard to accomplish (it took me several tries to figure out how to make the little rubber band go around the button to make a turban) and not good for plopping. I use it sideways so I can plop and encourage curl formation. So for curly heads, if you want a microfiber towel, stick with the regular ones. The turbans smush your hair and won't really work for plopping unless you use them just as you would a regular t-shirt or microfiber towel.The Diva Dryer does not dry my hair faster, as advertised. I don't notice any difference when using the Diva Dryer compared to using a plain old men's t-shirt. Both will absorb excess water (the t-shirt will feel wetter) and my hair will not be discernably drier after using the Diva Dryer. Thus, I don't think this costly towel is worth the money."
1,Mimi's Diva Dryer,This is an absolute waste of money and it is ridiculously hard to maneuver. Thumbs down. I returned mine.
5,Diva Dryer,Nice microfiber towel that dries my curly hair without pulling it and causing frizz. I like the snug fit with the button to secure it on the back. This towel makes it easy for me to get ready without my wet hair dripping everywhere.
3,Faulty/Loose Handles,"I bought these to rasp some wood down which I'm using for making long bows. If you want a fast way to shave down wood for shaping/carving, these are an excellent design.My only issue was due to the handle coming loose my first use. The plastic handle on the flat rasp handle came loose and made it hard to use. I ended up drilling a hole completely through the plastic handle and metal using a titanium bit and hammered in a metal dowel to keep the handle from coming off again.Note: Altering the rasp as so could weaken it!! I have shopped around and noticed that many rasp kits come with handles NOT already on the rasp itself? I'm hoping I'm just a super-novice?In any case, the project took me at least an hour longer than needed and now I worry for the other 2 handles in my kit could break loose.3 Stars for shaving fast and clean, -2 for possibly faulty plastic handle."
3,Not the Greatest,This set is fairly small and is for really rough rasping. I would spend a little more for a better set.
5,"Good deal, and a great product.","I had been beating my self up useing my old wood rasps. They were dull and the handles were missing. Usualy if I am going to buy on line I go to Amazon. These look and sounded like they would do the job. Now that I have used them, they feel great in my hand, and cut quickly with less effort."
5,Glad I bought these,"Inexpensive tools, but they work great if you want something this coarse. I used the half round one to shape a guitar neck (made out of hard wood) and it was very easy to do it with this. I pulled along the length instead of filing with it and it worked very good that way. It'd be even better if it had a handle at each end to grab onto (in my case). The half rounded side seems to dig in deeper, and the flat side helped to smooth it out a bit before I used a scraper and sandpaper to make it smooth. I would have preferred if the set came with some finer coarse-ness rasps too. I haven't had any use for the other shapes yet, but I'm sure most people can find places where they would want the flat or round ones.I haven't had any problems with them, they're still in great shape and they seem very strong/sturdy."
2,not great quality at all,"I purchased these knowing they were cheap and you get what you pay for, and I will say they are very poor quality. The teeth are all over the place out of the box and it doesnt cut very well but it will work for roughing up wood."
3,Ok,It works on some jars but not others. It slips and slides off the jar unless the lid is fairly large.
3,Hard to use if you have smaller hands,"I purchased this particular jar opener after having researched several different product styles. This works great on smaller lids - but then so would one of those rubber grip thingys. But I particularly needed it for larger lids, after I got a wide mouth jar and became frustrated when I couldn't quite wrap my hand around it. Notice the photo of this tool around the lid and how wide apart the handles will be and you'll realize (which I didn't) that it'll be difficult to use unless you can get your fingers around them. As for the product itself: what you see is what you get, it fits in small drawer spaces, and is well made.I think I'll go back and try one of those devices where it's placed on top, tightened, and then unscrews the lid off."
1,Skip it.,I found very little about this video to be beneficial for Taekwondo training and kicking. Maybe a few warmup tips but that's about it. Save your money.
1,poor excuse for a phonics program,"This program has nothing that could assist any child learn or review phonics. The so-called game reward is merely more work, and the work has no value ! If you are looking for a program that provides a learning experience, look elsewhere. If you think this will provide some sort of meaningful review of phonics, you will be quite disappointed.The producers of this program should hang their heads in shame!"
3,Always Burns out after 3 months,I went through 5 of these yes 5!!! i have a coffee table fish tank which this is best for and it always burns out for no reason. The motor sucks so i guess thats a reason. I finally stopped wasting my money and got a regular pump.
4,GSHOCK makes son happy,We bought this watch for sons birthday. It was worth waiting for. We researched alot of these watches and the price was right and it is REAL. There are alot of fakes out there. Be Careful!
4,Design and colour,The watch is a bit smaller than I thought and the colour is quite nice even though the blue doesn't really stand out. But overall satisfied with the product as the price is quite reasonable after the discount.
2,Not as great as I was expecting,"I loved this bedding because the pattern was so cute and unique. However, after washing it (according to the directions) the bumper covers shrunk significantly and the seams around the zippers are now very loose. I have a feeling this item will not last through several washings. I guess I was expecting a higher quality item for the price."
1,Poor Quality,"I was disappointed with the quality of all the Wendy Bellisimo products at BRU. I personally believe that there are better quality products in the store that cost much less. For [...]I was expecting the highest quality fabrics and stitching. That is not what I found. I have however found a Brandee Danielle set, Froggy Lavender, that is very similar and much higher quality. And it costs[....]. It is offered in yellow and pink as well. [...]"
3,Disappointed in the quality,"I just receieved my Sir Leapsalot and am quite disappointed in the quality. I looked at the other sets at Babies R Us, but this set wasn't set up in the store. The material feels sort of scratchy on the bumper and sheets. I love the soft blanket, but I am not sure if that would've been enough for me to spend so much money on the set! The coordinating pieces ARE adorable and I am sure my nursery will be beautiful when it's done, I just wish that the quality would've been a little better."
2,Shrunk so much after wash,"I purchased this set when I had my second daughter. I have to say I loved it when I first saw it at the store since we just painted the nursery lilac. The colors matched perfectly and the bedding has a nice subtlety to it. Problem arises so soon as I washed them. I was shocked to see how much those bumper covers shrunk. I washed them in cold water on delicate slow setting and dried them on low heat for 40 minutes and they came out shrunk so much that I can barely screeze in the paddings. There's nothing on the care label states that the bedding needs to be cleaned other ways. It's very disappionting that this set only has a highend look but not the quality to go with the look, consider this is a $300 sheet set. So, if you like the look of this set and will try not to wash them ever, then this is for you. But if you have a normal baby who will make a mess from time to time then get something easier to clean perhaps cheaper too"
3,Buy only for the design not quality,"I fell in love with the Sir Leaps alot bedding set. But I have to agree that the quality isn't what it should be for a $300.00 set. I had to take the set back because of stitching issues. I rebought the set because I really do love the frogs. The extra blankets you can buy are really soft. However the one that comes in the set is poor quality, I washed it once and the thread is pulling. I also noticed the pillow is cheeply made. But again I love the design and colors. I figure in a year from now I will change the room a little anyway. But beware this is not a set you will have for a long time."
1,It's still bad,"I wrote a review of this item and it for some reason got deleted as well. I have noticed this happening quite a bit with bad reviews on the Wendy Bellissimo items. I realize Babies R Us wants to promote it as much as possible since they bought Wendy off the high end market to come to theirs. But this is just disrespectful.The quality is not worth $300! The colors are ugly, the material is yucky, and the stitching is falling apart."
1,Never got it to work,"I bought this for my daughter last year for Christmas, but we never got the film to load. It sounds like maybe we just had a faulty camera, since other people got theirs to work. I returned this one and bought her a disposable camera instead!"
2,BROKE RIGHT AWAY,"THIS IS A VERY CUTE CAMERA, BUT IT BROKE RIGHT AWAY. WE DID REPAIR IT (OURSELVES), BUT IT BROKE AGAIN ANYWAY. THE PICTURES COME OUT CLOUDY, TOO. IT WILL MAKE A GOOD ""TOY"", BUT IT IS NOT FUNCTIONAL."
2,"Cute, but not very durable","This is ALL our daughter wanted from Santa and she was thrilled beyond belief that he came through for her. She was probably too young at 3.5 yrs, but she only used it under supervision and it still broke before the first roll of film had been used. Very disappointing!"
5,Great and non toxic - UPDATED 11/09,"My family has been using this for several years and we like it very much. We leave a large glass bowl full of the solution on the kitchen counter and use when needed.When the soultion looks dirty or after several days we toss it and renew. GREAT product.....I would like to add an update to this product. Lately I have been dealing with some kind of greasy residue in a hydroponic food growing system that bought. You can't just clean that with anything because any reside could kill or damage your plants.I took the system apart, cleaned it with this product, rinsed well and it cleaned the grease right off. I then restarted my process of reseeding and growing and my plants are thriving! WOW that is no easy feat. This is a superb product in my opinion and if it works on grease and does not harm sensitive seedlings I call that a win -win product. Hope that helps somebody..."
5,"A well written, witty and inspiring read","This is a chronicle of Dave's athletic achievements refracted through his wit, everyman's life and New England charm. He perseveres through the same ailments, injuries and woes as the rest of us - but he still pulls ""it"" off. Dave's vision to raise money and consciousness for great causes is on display here, too. I'm training for some personal goals this year (and for years to come.) I purchased one copy as a gift for a friend (his first ""Boston"") and a second copy for myself. I'm glad I purchased both."
5,Inspirational,"Great read Dave!Inspiration from someone who has done some inspiring things. Dave's the real deal. Unlike many of our contemporary self-help prophets Dave's got the resume to back it up. He's unpretentious in his accounts and proves the value of setting goals, pursuing them like mad and then setting new goals until life becomes a happy whirl of accomplishment.The most outstanding thing I learned, and Dave epitomizes, is the power of giving. If you sow so shall you reap - and look at what is possible! Helping people makes his world and ours a better place and that's his success.I'll be running your (our) big race again this year - thank you and keep it coming...Read this book and then buy a copy for someone you love.Chris Russell"
2,250 Pages of Bragging,"This is the most annoying, self-aggrandizing narrative ever written. He brags about everything he's ever done, inserts useless ""quotes"" from his friends and siblings - mostly quotes that brag about what a special guy he is, and acts as if he's the greatest and most selfless ultrarunner who has graced this green earth. He even has his ""resume"" of accomplishments at the end, to ensure that the reader has a full complement of information on what a swell guy Dave is."
2,What did seven years do?,"The Diadem series captivated me a couple years ago and I couldn't wait for Mr. Peel to finish the series. When I found out the 7th book was coming out, I was giddy with joy. I thought it'd be brilliant. Sadly, I was mistaken. The Book of War just didn't captivate the style and small details of the previous books. Some were small things like when Helaine said, ""Danger"" instead of the usual, ""Trouble."" The book just didn't flow as well as the others did."
2,nice but worthless in the wind,This would be a great hat except for the fact that it won't stay on my baby's head if there is even a breeze at the beach since it doesn't have a strap under the chin to secure it in place. He also pulls it off very easily. I literally had to put the hat back on his head every 10 seconds which was not only irritating to me but to him as well. I understand that chin straps are forbidden now in today's litigious society but this unfortunately makes the hat completely useless unless you have a day with no wind and yours is a child who will keep a hat on his head!
4,My 1st Laptop is impressive,"So far so good. (knock on wood) Compaq is a brand I normally shy away from, but this time around they offered a good value ($... before the $... rebates [local retailer]). I love the power of this notebook. The built-in 802.11b works great with my home network after a very lengthy call with tech support. (hold time wasn't too bad, just the troubleshooting) All is well now. I like the features: floppy, CDRW/DVD,fire-wire port, 3 USB 2.0 ports,Wi-Fi, 1 PCMCIA slot, and decent 2.5hr battery. So far, I would recommend it!"
3,Can't Say You've Never Heard of It,"Never Heard of It recently released their CD, ""11 Days,"" and although they remain unsigned, the band has been on Warped Tour, played the Surf and Skate Fest in New Jersey, and just wrapped up a tour with Allister. ""11 Days"" is filled with 11 tracks of hardcore pop/punk rock and each one is extremely catchy with a great melody. At first listen, you might even think this is the new Good Charlotte record as the songs sound influenced by Good Charlotte, New Found Glory and Simple Plan. The lead singer has a heavy voice so the vocals are sometimes switched back and forth between two of the band members like Tom and Mark of Blink-182. The album is one you can listen to in its entirety and standout tracks include: ""Let's Go All the Way,"" ""Hard Headed,"" I'll Change for Now,"" It's Not Possible,"" and ""Walkin' Alone."" Overall, a must have for anyone's collection."
2,Had better,"I have had Harney & Sons teas in the past and blackcurrant was one of them. With that knowledge I purchased an entire pound since their tea was always delicious. I was very happy when I opened the bag. I saw blackcurrant and a beautiful tea. I made a pot of tea and was very disappointed, it tasted like a regular black tea. There was nothing special to it. I will not be buying a pound bag of their tea anymore."
5,Womens Language of Success,"This is a good book for rebuilding your self- confidence. I bought this on a recommendation from a friend to help me become a better manager, but unfortunately, It didn't work out on that end, but I learned how to make me a stronger person."
3,How to enjoy the Bible,All must be read in conjunction with the Scriptures let no man fool you Christ is the same today as yesterday.The depths contained in this book does challenge you to think!
1,WOW!,"I've seen many movies in my time. Some good, some bad. But this one is a real STINKER. Badly acted, terrible 'script', no plot to speak of and really, no Idea of what they are doing. In my opinion, the only thing this film is doing is wasting peoples time. Life is too short. Walk the dog, squash snails, count clouds, ANYTHING other than waste your money on this tripe.Then again, if you like Z class movies and like watching movies that make you feel that you want to have your stomach pumped afterwards to purge the garbage that you have just ingested, then this is the movie for you.Watch this movie alone, that way you will never have to admit that you have seen it.David"
1,Main word Here is ...,"WASTE...I do not know what pocessed me to buy this ""movie"",I believe an alien entity entered my mind and made me WASTE money but lukily it left after this purchase.This is the very first time that I have gone below 3 stars.""Nevermore,""cried the Raven ..."
3,papa k,"Even for an exploitation T & A flick ,it is a total loser. Shouldn't even be called a ""B"" Movie. Lame and boring tp the point that it should be listed as a sleeping aid."
1,Lame,"Ok from reading the other reviews I had low expectations but this movie was even worse than I anticipated, there are many other movies I would have been better off wasting the few dollars on."
1,She Wolves,"The movie is set in the future on planet earth. Women are the dominant sex in this film. The plot, if you can call it that, centers around this theme.Poor acting, poor directing, and poor quality. Not sure why anyone wasted time putting this to DVD; better yet to film."
1,Wasted money,What a total waste of my money...would have liked to view a trailer of this movie before I bought it..
2,Entertaining I guess..,Its funny how some people describe this as Mad Max but with women or Mad Max with cheap special effects or Mad Max with bad acting. Well is like a cheese-burger after I eat it and its gone through my digestive system. Oh well I do have to say it keeps you entertained all through out. Really good comedy
1,1 star says it all.,"I wish I could give {She Wolves of the Wasteland} a lower rating than 1 star, it was a waste of money. If you are just hitting puberty this would be a good movie."
3,Good DVD,It is a good but not excellent movie. There is beautiful women and great body. But not as I hope for.
1,what a dissapointment,"This movie is stupid. I got it because I was looking for porn, and no. This movie was the opposite of porn this movie was just a cheep rip-off of mad max. It's only R rated because there's one scene with women with very nice but that is one small scene and the rest of the movie sucked."
2,Disapointed,"From the other reviews it sounded hot, but it could not keep my attention. As far as nudity, there is only one brief scene with partial nudity. The hot women staring in the film never get naked. The action and fight scenes are so cheezy, you can't even mention a comparsion with the epic ""Mad Max""."
3,Phoenix the Warrior,"This movie is unique in the way they shifted things around. Since all the men were killed off by some plague the women are alone to continue the wars and battles. This movie is base in the future but nothing is left from our society except for bullets, guns, cars and gasoline. One woman is artificially implanted with a baby boy and gives birth to it. Our hero Phoenix accepts the role of protecting this woman and her child from the evil women who want the child's DNA. Just like most action adventure films their not much of a story line here but in this day of age is enlightening to see women on the other end of the gun."
2,Good time passer,"People stop reviewing this like a normal film. This is a classic B-movie to be watched when you don't have anything else to do. Leave it at that. I laugh at how seriously people review this movie. It accomplishes what it set out to do, provide a film full of scantily clad females. Maybe I should change my 2 stars to four based on that."
5,Best by far,"I took this model to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom and used it in the harshest conditions imaginable. It consistently picked up a signal, even when my military issue GPS would not. It literally saved my life on more than one occasion. It withstood extreme heat and dust with not problems. The memory could have been better, but it out performed other brands that I saw and used while I was deployed."
4,Very nicely done.,I can't add to much that hasn't been said in the other review only to reiterate that this is just and excellent reference book for anyone who loves wildflowers and lives or comes to Washington State. It is well organised and has great trails from many parts of the state to explore. I borrowed it from the library but I am definitely buying this one for my own collection now.
4,It's a good little workbook.,"(This is the same review as for the Volume 1 workbook.)I think this Russian course is the best I've seen so far. Unfortunately, the textbook that goes with this workbook is no longer published by the original publisher (red and white book), and the new publisher (red and black book) has apparently only photocopied the original, as the Russian text is quite dark and a little difficult to read for that reason.As far as this workbook goes, I haven't seen the new publisher's version, but the printing on this older one is fine."
1,The Revolt of Mamie Stover,"I read the book in 1955, a paperback at a cost of 1.50. To be sold the same paperback (Reissued) with a initial price of less than 2 dollars, for the price of over 30 dollars with shipping leaves a very bad taste about dealing with Amazon for any future products or books. Jerome Simonson"
4,Great fun!,"Mr. Sardonicus won't win any awards for the art of film making, but it is a great deal of fun to watch!While it's not as over-the-top as Castle's other works, such as The Tingler or House on Haunted Hill, Mr. Sardonicus does possess a charm that only William Castle can bring to these glorious black and white treasures.Guy Rolfe is memorable as the title character, and his supporting cast members are equally fine throughout.The dvd quality is to be expected for a film of this vintage, and my copy was fine; clear and crisp - it almost looks like it could have been a film made in the 80's."
3,LESSER CASTLE CURIO....,"This is an odd movie about a man who's face is frozen into a hideous grin after witnessing a traumatic shock. He sends for a famous plastic surgeon to cure him then blackmails the doctor into treating him by holding the surgeon's fiancee prisoner. Oscar Homolka is memorable as the man's servant but the movie is talky and rather dreary. Not much really happens. It's really more of a drama than a horror movie. The gimmick at the end is a ""thumbs up or thumbs down"" to vote on the man's fate at the hands of his servant when it is revealed the man has been a cruel master and may or may not deserve to be cured. I didn't like it. I found it disappointing and dull. Judge for yourself---thumbs up or thumbs down? Thumbs down from me."
2,Major letdown,"I am sorry, but this movie struck me as being incredibly boring! There are absolutely no surpises nor horrors in stock. If you want gothic atmosphere, surely there are a dozen better movies at hand here somewhere. The picture/sound quality of this DVD was very good, but this alone didn't save this bundle of misery."
4,Unfair,"The reviews here have been too harsh to this book. This book is not meant by any strech to be a replacement for the Penguin Jazz on CD Guide, but as a list and analysis of 100 very good jazz CDs it isn't bad at all. The reviews are generally insightful and informative, and the book contains a fine balance of big band, be-bop, and post-bop, with all the colours in between. (His defense of Cecil Taylor is particularly refreshing.) I might quibble with the title, but no list of 100 CDs will satisfy every reader as including all the ""essentials."" The main list, combined with the additional 100 CDs listed in the appendix, would provide enough listening enjoyment for a lifetime."
1,about the author more than the music,"Ratliff just can't help inserting himself at every turn in this book. Here's an example: The chapter on ""Bill Evans Trio: Saturday at the Village Vanguard"" begins: ""There's a single-minded, amiable rapture suffusing most of Bill Evans's music that just doesn't do it for me in the long run. It's not my mood; it's not one of the things that satisfies my thrill seeking."" Well, gee, thanks for sharing sharing; but save it for your diary. If you enjoy watching an author shoot from the hip (Sarah Vaughan, he says, ""in certain low-register moments ... approaches vulgarity"" and is lacking in ""good taste""), maybe you'll enjoy it. If you simply want to learn more about the peak recordings of jazz history, turn elsewhere."
1,Not the Best Place to Start,"This book is NOT a list of the 100 ""best"" jazz recordings, but rather what the author considers the 100 ""most important."" That means he includes albums that he admits even he doesn't like, because they're good for you. [Like spinach]He also views jazz history through the lens of racism, which seems to influence a number of his choices and explanations.I would recommend buying the Penguin Guide instead. It's far more comprehensive and the ratings are more reliable. If it seems too intimidating, start with the albums that earn a Rosette--that will still be a better starting place than the list in this book."
5,Another wonderful book from Lois Rock!,"Lois Rock has written four books in this series of Learning About... and I recommend purchasing all four of them for your youngsters. Delightful full-color pictures give depth and meaning to the twelve questions answered pertaining to Jesus' life and death. Great explanations to the questions young children have asked time and again from their parents. If you are a Christian wishing to introduce your children to Jesus, be sure to get this book."
5,Extremely Pleased,"I bought this laptop (my first) two weeks ago after several weeks of research. I read all of the Amazon[.com] reviews about this laptop and several others. I also checked with Consumer Reports and several computer information websites. I feel I made a well-informed desicion. This laptop was purchased as a replacement to my desktop. From the moment I removed it from the box and plugged it in, I have been extremely pleased. I work from home as a bookkeeper and this laptop handles all of my programs flawlessly. Unlike a previous reviewer, I have never had a problem with the modem. In fact, I do not have one single complaint or dislike. I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone in the market for one."
1,Runs WAY too hot....,"A major disappointment. I have had this computer for 3 years and I do regret buying it. It seemed like an outstanding computer when I purchased it but it was not long before heat became a major issue. Yes, it is very well equipped...but it overheats so easily and suddenly shuts off that it negates most features. I can not afford to keep repairing my computer every few months. I can go online with this computer and word process...that is pretty much it. There are far more affordable models that can meet those needs. If I play a video game, burn a CD, or try to print a long document the computer overheats and loses power. It would be comical if it had not cost me so much to buy it. I would not purchase any Toshiba computer product in the future just because this laptop left a very bitter taste in my mouth."
4,Superb insight into Korean lifestyle.,"Peace Under Heaven, by Ch'ae Man-Sik, is one of the most informative books in history to shed light on the lifestyle of Koreans under Japanese colonial rule. The story follows the trials and tribulations of Master Yun, a Korean rice dealer, whose role in society is influenced by these Japanese rulers. The book also gives creative insight into the roles of women in society, as well as information on the class system of Korea at the time. For all those interested in Asian history, I highly recommend this novel due to all the reasons mentioned."
1,Don't Buy it!,I was extremely disappointed with this book. This book is full of Mr. Kennedy's and his buddies adventures in business but has very little for a person starting up a business. Don't waste your money on this book. I found better information on the internet.
1,Sorry,"Sorry Gloria, but I don't like your writings or writing style. I admit, I didn't finish reading this book for those reasons."
2,Not For Me,This was just too boring. I'm not politically minded and I don't know if that's what is required to appreciate this book but I just couldn't slog through it. I'm a woman and I know that we've 'come a long way baby' but maybe this was just too 'old news'.
3,old stuff,"I liked reading the Bunny Club expose, but the rest of the book had bygone political figures. This would be OK to use for a research paper of that era. I clicked it to the storage bin."
5,required reading for young women today,This should be required reading for young women today so they can appreciate what they have because of women before them and in order to understand the process of change if they desire to make a difference in their own lives.
3,undeniable light on male/female experience,"gloria is an engaging writer who presents anthropological, psychological, social, and gender arguments and observations only the ignorant/arrogant could argue with. i liked some of her accounts more than others, but never boring! -a really decent read!"
1,"Gloria, and more gloria","Many of her earlier books were more invative. Mostly rehash of old ideas, lacks innovative ideas. Other books are better use of time. Very disappointed!"
1,"Gloria, and more gloria",Mostly rehash of old ideas covered in her other books. Other books are better use of time.
1,"Cheap, terrible, over-priced","I'm an expert paint-by-number painter. This kit is horrible! The template looks nothing like the original art, the colors are all primary colors, its pretty much a cheesy kids's quality paint by number kit. Rose Art should be ashamed to put out such a trashy kit. Note to Rose Art: Please put a picture of the finished art on the COVER, and not an original work by the author, its a cheap, misleading marketing ploy to get us to purchase this low-quality kit. 1 star. Disappointing."
3,Overall it's a good product,"The Acer USB port disconnects when copying images from some camera. This is one of the main things I wanted to use it for.Tech support stepped me through a few updates, but was unsuccessful in helping me."
2,Took too long to get delivered,Although I'm glad my mother finally received the cookbook I ordered for her it was 3 weeks past the date I was told and a full week after Christmas. I will not order from the book depository again.
4,Very nice one at the price,"Nice looking and comfortable wearing.It would be better if the lining is leather or cotton, in stead of polyester."
3,I wanted to like it,"Walter Mosley gets an 'A' for originality and a 'C' for execution on this one. If he had pared back the sci-fi a little bit, it would have been outstanding, but when Tall John begins naming all the beings in his world, the story gets bogged down in the minutia. I wanted less of the Quesziastril, Calash, and Talam. I wanted more of the legend of John the Conqueror. I wanted to be bound up in the tale, as a Mosley offering will usually do, but when I had to stop to decipher which extraterrestrial was which, I lost the flow of 47's narrative."
5,Mosley-Modern Day Griot-Rush the Sequels,"47 joins the rare pantheon of young adult literature that is badly mislabled. This is simple literature at its most illuminating, haunting best. This is not a read just younger children. However this should be read and interpreted by an adult to elementary school children who need to understand the horror that was American slavery but also the strength and fortitude it took to survive. It should be read by everyone else because it is a fabulous story well told. Mosely is a gifted, gifted writer and here's hoping that young and old of all cultures experience his unique gift."
4,Marvelous,I liked this book because it showed slavery in a different way. It was also very different compared to Mosley's series. Good read.
2,Unbelievable - Really,"I tried. I truly did. To finish the book. But gave up due to my inability to suspend my disbelief when the author chose to head for deep space.What promised to be an exciting historical tale of escape from the cruelties of slavery, turned into a sci-fi story of unrealistic proportions. The author seemed to be at cross purposes in terms of genre. Had not the fantastical elements taken over in the final third of the book, I might have stayed with it until the bitter end. As much as I hate to give up on a book, this just stretched too far."
4,Unexpected!!!,"This book is written in a new perspective for a slavery era book. It has traditional and SCI-FIi elements to it. The themes are complex, but definitely accessible to middle school students. I'm glad I had the opportunity to read this book with my classroom."
4,Great mixture of elements,"Mosley does a great job attacking such a difficult subject matter. Some may argue that useful knowledge cannot be gained from a sci-fi themed text. This novel, however, makes me disagree with that thought. Woven within the science fiction elements of the novel is the story of a slave who could be just as real as you and I. Mosley uses very straightforward and descriptive language to portray slavery in a very bright and glaring light. The elements work together to form a work that attacks a sensitive subject in an approachable way. The characters are well developed and thought out. 47 truly is a uniquely formed slave narrative that is worth the read."
3,47,I enjoyed reading this book. It was different from other books that I have read by Walter Mosley.
5,Worlds Fade Away - Nik Rael,"From the moment I heard the first song it brought one of my all time favorites Van Morrison to mind. Because as well as being very soulful there is also a ceratin mystical quality to this CD. These songs just keep repeating themselves in your head. I would find myself just absent mindedly singing or humming a melody and wondering what it was. Turns out it was from Worlds Fade Away. Just by coincidence I was listening to the radio the other day and I heard this familiar song. It was Nik Rael and he was singing live promoting his CD and he was saying how he was heavily influenced by Dylan, The Beatles , Bob Marley, and guess who, Van Morrison. And the DJ was saying how gets piles of CDs but this one stood out. I agree. I am a huge music fan and this guy is the ""goods""."
4,its okay,"I like how its light and non greasy, but dont think its works as fast as others lighteners. And I hate that it has fragrance. Overall its okay, great for acne prone skin and great price."
5,COMPRA,"Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras"
4,DREADFUL HOURS A GRANDE SONG,"Ah yes...the first tune on here is damn heavy. All about child abuse and whatnot. AND SO YOUNG BOY MY HAND BRINGS DOOOOOM!!! Heh, Heh. Good stuff. After that my expectations were so high.Indeed it it is a great album. My only complaint is that perhaps the singer should stick to writing more about dark subjects like in the first song...the music loses a bit of intensity when he sings on and on about losing a lover. (Although that dark romance stuff is good too.) Good music from our British friends."
4,Yet Another Excellent Release From My Dying Bride,"My Dying Bride is a truley excellent band. They are my favorite band of all time. The Dreadful Hours is another great cd by them, but its sad that its missing the band's trademark violin. Never the less the cd is filled with emotion and dark, depressing music. I recomend it to all fans of gothic/ doom metal."
4,the new bride,"the new release from englands king of gloom and doom.my dyingbride.this is a great cd with the come back of aarons growlsthat made this band.the cd opens with the somber the dreadfulhours with its haunting intro.tracks like the raven and therose,the return of the beautiful,black heart romance makethis a strong cd fans of bride sould pick this up"
4,Excellant way to begin understanding Custer.,"I found the book to be well written with enough historical references to give the reader a sense of that period in history. However, I found it to be slightly laborious in some of the descriptions around events that, I found, not important in defining Custer or his family. An example is when the author went into lengthy details on the practical jokes he and his family participated in on a regular basis. Overall, I would highly recommend this book and intend to read more in the future about this fascinating and definitely misunderstood person."
2,A Boring View of Custer,"I was very disappointed after reading this book; I expected more from the Oscar winner for the screenplay, based from his book, DANCES WITH WOLVES. Frankly, the book is rather boring. There are rare moments where you can't wait to find what happens.It's ironic that Blake originally despised Custer while writing DANCES WITH WOLVES then, later, found he liked Custer after all. If only he could have written about Custer's last days with more passion and ambition, yet, he did not.I do NOT think this is a good book to start one's discovery of Custer. For that, I'd strongly recommend Louise Barnett's TOUCHED BY FIRE."
5,Super Car Audio processor...,"This is a must have for any audiophile who wants their car audio to sound its best... I have it connected to my Alpine IVA-W205 and it sounds unbelievable... It adds 512 Graphic EQ or P-EQ, digital optical, and DTS 5.1 surround sound... It just completes any sound system..."
4,Very nice but notice the size!,"This tarp is good quality. Beware, the finished product is NOT 6x8 but six inches shorter due to reinforcement of the edges."
1,Lame,"This movie is no where near the likes of Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity. Amateur acting, audio, make up, script - did I say acting? I've seen 1950's wolfman B movies more put together that this."
2,Don.t bother,"As a horror fan I watch this genre as often as possible. This is NOT a movie for horror fans. Terrible story line, poor acting and never a truly scary moment. Pass on this one."
2,ONE STEP BEYOND sequel has some nice scares !,"From MaximMedia is this Ghost Story about a Haunted House...Blah,Blah-But wait it's a sequel to an episode of a series not seen since 1959.The original `Captain's Guest' is more about this painting posessing a new man( owner) in the house,Well in Back To The Beyond--There is a new reality show that gets affected by the painting and it's limping ghost.There is a lot of character development of the P.A.R.A Team characters and some of it goes somewhere plot wise and some of it not.In research, It is revealed years later DARK SHADOWS would borrow similar points for a ""Quentin"" story line and AMITYVILLE HORROR also had some of these borrowed elements.Not sure why,But technically on film quality,There are some blurs in reproduction quality."
4,Seksee looking laptop for hot price!,"The laptop looks very nice and well designed. The colot scheme with silver/carbon black is great. The keyboard is well laid out. The fan isn't noisy and mobile Athlon is great!Battery life is in excess of 3 hrs and laptop doesn't get hot either. The LCD is good and has good range of viewing angle. The warranty support from Compaq is better than HP, atlhough both are same companies now. If you want blue scheme instead of silver try the HP ZE4200 series and its same hardware as Compaq.The prices are low in most local stores than Amazon. Kudos to HP/Compaq for designing such low cost and fully functional laptop."
5,Great compromise between power and price,"I've owned this laptop for about a month now, and am very impressed. The extra memory and large hard drive make it a bargain if you hunt around for the best price ...The CD burner isn't fast, but for personal use I don't think it makes a lot of difference. Plays DVDs with no problems whatever. And, by the way, in the box I found a coupon to get a USB floppy drive free after rebate from HPshopping.com (expires in early June). No complaints here!"
1,Uses copy protection without informing !,This laptop's hard disk/IDE controller/Combo drive collude together to prevent lots of normal things from happenning. Like installation of many softwares from back up copies. Troubles wth DVD's and digital media. Reading CD-R's etc. Imagine spending so much money on laptop which won't play your favorite music or movies!Stay away from these content protection & monitoring (CPRM based?) laptops made by Compaq.Not to mention that they run very hot. And Windows restarts every time you plug in anything into the usb ports. The laptop hard drive is very noisy and so is the flimsy keyboard. The laptop is clumsy & ugly looking. Think carefully before getting this.
5,KitchenAid Work Bowl Cover,I am very happy with the work bowl cover for my kitchenaid food-processor. Ordering was simple and delivery was on time. Thank-you
5,Great fit!!!,Received my kitchenaid from my sister in law without the bowl cover. figured i could order one online. found this one on amazon and it Works perfectly! Nice and snug!
3,Worked with a little modification,I was glad to finally purchase this item as it was recently not available from the manufacturer nor anywhere on line. I did have an issue with it not locking in place smoothly and needed to grind off some of the plastic in order to make it work so that my wife could use it without my help.
3,KitchenAid Food Processer bowl cover KFPCF,I broke the bowl cover to my Kitchen Aid Food Processer. I found the replacement cover on Amazon.com. They had the best price and shipping costs of any other website. Just wish KitchenAid had made a better design as it is always a hassle putting and taking off the cover.
2,Save your money-- there are better books out there!,"While on bedrest with my fourth pregnancy, I ordered a couple of books from Amazon. This one had very little helpful information. I was able to read through the whole thing in less than an hour. Cheesey, touchy-feely, but NOT helpful. The second book I ordered, ""Pregnancy Bedrest: A Journey of Love"", was much more useful with great things to do with your other kids, in-bed exercises/stretches, lots of links & other resources. I have a feeling I will be referring to this book often during my pregnancy. If you are in the same circumstance, hang in there & God bless!"
2,Days in Waiting: A Guide to Surviving Prenancy Bedrest,"I found this book to be depressing and bleak. As a fellow high risk patient as well as on complete bedrest for 10 weeks this book was not uplifting to me. Sure, bedrest is very hard but you have to remain positive and count every day as a major accomplishment. I would have like to see more information on activities to do while in bed, exercises for upper body, calendars. As an informed patient the doctor's questions we of no value. I think a much ""cheerier"" spin could have been put in this book. I was very disappointed!"
2,Short and Lame,"This book is not what I expected at all... it's more like a workbook than a ""book."" It really doesn't contain any information I didn't already know. I spent 3 months on bedrest with my second pregnancy (after having my first unexpectedly at 32 weeks), and I don't think I opened this book once after reading it through in the first hour I got it. I agree with another poster who said she really doesn't deal with the psychological distress of bedrest at all. It's more like, ""oh, gee, you're on bedrest, why don't you make a scrapbook!"""
4,"Helpful, realistic, not ""bleak""","I thought the book was really good. It was nice to read advice from someone who didn't try to ""sugar-coat"" bedrest. It's tough and really difficult. I already recommended the book to my doctors office. I think most women would get alot out of reading this book.I just wish there were websites listed in the resource chapter, since I'm online all the time! I'm shopping for the baby and chatting online, and there are a lot of good resources on the internet for pregnant women."
5,THE ONE TO BUY!,"Filled with practical and useful information from a woman who has been there and lived to tell about it! If you are on bedrest, buy this book; you won't be sorry. There's even a chapter that addresses the emotional side of bedrest, and it's all true! Nobody else has understood what I'm going through, and I feel like this book spoke to me and helped me when nobody else could."
2,Really Didn't Meet My Needs!!,I bought this book based on ratings and I am not impressed. Been on bedrest for 8 weeks and struggling with depression and anxiety - these types of problems are not addressed very well - disappointed but I will find another one - still 8 more weeks to go.
5,Helpful!!,"A great help to me! The workbook format, filled with practical, inspirational suggestions and ideas, was easy to read, and easy to use. Monica J."
5,Excellent Live Document,"Camel's Y2K tour almost didn't happen, for several harrowing reasons detailed in the liner notes. And then technical difficulties almost prevented it being documented. So it is a great joy and marvelous blessing that one of the last dates on the tour, 30 October 2000 in Bataclan, was captured in pristine digital sound.This version of Latimer's perennial band (as in ""perennial flowers"") is a particularly collegial one which quickly gelled into quite the powerhouse, and Andy's playing has never been better (ever!) His voice was a little ragged from overuse and bronchitis, so the set concentrates instead on long insrumental passages which, for my money, is the best Camel anyway.A wonderful set all around.Here's a tip however -- save yourself about ten bucks and buy it direct from Camel Productions..."
5,"CAMEL,YESTERDAY,TODAY AND TOMORROW.","CAMEL,the fantastic group never dead ,your music is present in the future generations."
4,I can't be entirely objective,"I can't be objective because much of the book uses the Civil War diaries and letters of my great-grandfather. Personal responses aside, A FIRE WITHIN gave me a perspective of the war from both the home front and the battlefields. I found having some knowledge of the Civil War helpful, because the battles are not put in perspective with the ongoing campaigns or the general war experiences, and I would have liked to see a little more of that in the book. That's a quibble; Dr. Trask does an excellent job of letting his subjects speak for themselves. I found the experiences of all the subjects of the book very moving and it deepened my understanding of at least the Northen experience of the war. It also helped to understand the impact of and on the western states. Many histories give the perspective of the Eastern states only."
5,Fire Within,"Having had the privilege of taking two college history courses taught by Dr. Trask, I have seen first hand the knowledge and passion he brings to the subject. I highly recommend Fire Within to anyone who wants to know more about the ""home front"" during the Civil War."
5,Camelbak Rogue,"No one makes a hydration pack like Camelbak. I bought this a month ago to replace my cheap hydration pack and I am sorry I waited so long for one of these. I have used this for 150+ miles of mountain biking so far usually 1.5-2.5 hour rides and the 70oz is enough in cooler weather. My favorite features are the 90deg. mouth piece, the velcro straps that keep the extra shoulder straps for flopping around, and the plastic clip inside the bottom compartment that I can put my key ring on and have extra confidence that it is not going to fall out. Nice pack!"
5,Love It!,"I'm not a professional bike rider by any means, just do a little light trail riding and was tired of reaching for my water bottle all the time. The pack is easy to use, holds my keys, cell phone and small tools while I'm riding and is so light, I barely notice its there. Would definitely recommend this product."
5,DH loves it,"My husband bought this for himself - he has been taking 50 mile bike rides on the weekends. He is very happy with all the features and functionality of the Camelbak. However he cautions users not to clean the unit with brushes! As a homebrewer, cleaning plastic buckets and equipment with brushes leave scratches in the plastic that cannot be sanitized and the same is true for the Camelbak. A weak bleach solution is your best way to clean and sanitize your Camelbak."
5,Camelbak Rogue 70 is GREAT,"Compact, yet holds a lot. Mouthpiece doesn't leak at all. I mountain bike, and it holds enough water for a 4 hour hard ride. Love it."
4,I love this thing!,Before getting the CamelBak I was using a water bottle when biking. I found I wind up drinking more water using the CamelBak than I do using a bottle because it is so much more convenient. This keeps me better hydrated and makes for a much better ride overall for me. Very easy to use and great for storing the usual list of goods you need to take along. It has a nice sized opening for dropping ice cubes in along with the water to keep things cool. Someone gave this item a bad rating saying the water tasted like chemicals when they used it. Not even! The only off taste I get is if the ice cubes have been in the freezer too long. I would get another one of these any day if I needed to and am considering one that holds more water for longer rides.
4,Keeping hydrated while having shear fun,"Works great, but the cold liquid heats up in tube & that could be insulated just a little. Nice to keep hydrated while working in the heat / sun."
4,Worked better than expected,"I used this all week in day camp as a den leader for Cub Scouts. It worked perfectly. I filled it up with bottled water and let it freeze for a few hours in the freezer. Just before bed I would take it out of the freezer and put it in the fridge.There were enough room in the pockets for my car keys, phone, wallet, small first aid kit, spray vials of antiseptic and Off and a Gerber multi-tool in pouch. I could have stuffed more in there had I wanted.When strapped on, the pack stayed in place and didn't jiggle but still felt light on my shoulders - I've had two lower-back surgeries and did not feel any ache due to wearing it.It was really popular with the kids too, I wasn't the only one there with a hydration system but I seemed to be the only one they asked about it so they must have really liked the Rouge design.Bottom line: it held all my stuff, and didn't hurt my back, and it stayed icy for most of the day....for Florida in June, that's all I can ask."
4,Great Camel Pack,"The size is great for a full day of biking, and there is plenty of sstorage space for cell, wallet, keys. Even an MP3. zipper pocket can become damp, but outside mesh is perfect."
4,Functional,"Nothing really stands out about this pack. I use it for shorter mountain biking or hiking trips, but for longer trips I have the Octane 14+ 3 liter pack, which I prefer (though it is much bulkier). If searching for a lightweight, comfortable and functional 2 liter pack, this is quite good."
2,"Good product, but not very adjustable","The shoulder straps have limited adjustment. I'm 6'3"" and 225. The shoulder straps would have probably broken had I flexed forward and the front strap wasn't even close to connecting. I had to return it."
4,Muy buen producto,"Es una exelente mochila, la uso para hacer bicicleta de montaña en mi pais Honduras y me parece un producto muy practico y de buena calidad, justo lo que necesito para llevar agua y herramientas basicas."
4,Very good deal for the price!,"This CamelB was a good deal for the price, the side pockets are big enough to carry your wallet, mobile phone, or anything else compare to other options out ther. Overall good deal."
4,Good for long distance runs,I wanted something that held more water than a fuel belt for my long distance runs in the trails. After an initial adjustment period I learned how to use the straps properly and it allowed me to run my first 50K. Slows me down somewhat but if you are going the distance on the trails it definitely is very useful...
3,Good product but could be improved,"I use this product for long distance hiking.Pros: compact, feels comfortable and light on my back, keeps water cool even after 3 hours, the front accessory pockets allow me to carry my phone, keys, and even an extra shirt among other things.Cons:-When I run, the straps slide a bit no matter how I adjust them-The front straps come off at times but they are easily fixed-The bite valve and hydrolock became ineffective and water started leaking after the 8th use.I think it would be useful to have extra bite valves as well as hydrolocks for replacement when they start leaking. I ended up taking out the water bladder and putting water bottles inside the backpack instead while I wait for the replacement parts to be shipped so I guess even without the water bladder, the backpack can still be made useful. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product. I just wish the bite valve and hydrolock were more durable."
5,Great purchase,"What a difference from water bottles to a Camelbak. And the Rogue is the perfect size and weight for the two to three hour rides that I go on. Two liters is plenty and it stays cold. I also stick my truck keys and my phone back there too. Its great to have my phone on me to take pictures every once in a while. Let me add, its very easy to clean."
4,Another Fine Collection,"This has beautiful and pleasant Baroque chestnuts that should appeal to everyone. It may be more-of-the-same, given the Loussier treatment, but one could certainly do worse. There are some who don't care too much for Classical music but they almost always like Pachelbel's Canon. There are some who don't like screeching, unstructured jazz, but they like a little rhythm. This would be an ideal album for them. Anyway, there's really nothing not to like. The Pachelbel and Albinoni are quite beautifully done. It's a pleasure to listen to."
3,Crossover compromise,"When I first heard individual cuts from this CD I was intriqued by the synthesis of jazz and classical styles. I was also pursuaded initially by the reviews from Loussier's fans who contextualized this album as a gem within his larger body of work. Unfortunately, upon hearing the cuts all the way through, I found it to be another classic crossover compromise. Loussier is neither a good jazz pianist nor a respectable classical pianist. Combining the genres does not make him any better."
2,Poorly written more a reference than a text book,"This book's English prose is filled with jargon which a beginning student of Greek really does not need--it is also infelicitous and hard to follow. It is not a book of great""clarity"" indeed sometimes it is incomprehensible. I have shown it to teachers of English composition who were amused or outraged. It is a book that will discourage the less talented from pursuing Greek unlike Athenaze which takes a slower and more discursive approach. If you have a great talent for morphology this may be your text--for us ordinary folks it is overwhelming and at times so badly written that one feels a need to translate the English rather than the Greek."
4,Best Greek Book I've used,"When I first started studding Greek I had bought two different instructional texts, one of which was Greek an Intensive Course. The first book I got me reading early but did little to explain the grammar I needed to use to really understand Greek. I then got this book, and blown away by how clear it was able to make the Greek language for me.Greek is hard and I would recommend taking a course from a good instructor if you really want to wrap your mind around this language, but even spending time reading this book outside of class I was able to understand and put to use most of what was presented. I still find this book to be one of my best grammar references, and I now use it to tutor other Greek students."
2,Not so great for home-learning,"The book is thick enough to be used in a multi-semester Greek course. And it is not so feasible for home-alone learning. There are many many explanations that confuse the reader. A less extended, but easier-to-follow book would be much more helpful for beginners.One important thing that I realized is the pronunciation rules (especially diphtongues) are taught differently. Actually this is the problem in English-Greek books. I am quite sure that some words are not pronounced as they describe in the book. I also follow a Turkish-Greek book and I find the differences after I read both. So you must also have an audio book kind of thing to confirm the information."
3,"please someone, write a new Greek textbook","This is by far the best textbook around for teaching Ancient Greek and yet it is terrible. The individual units are far far too big for one lesson and the exercises cannot easily be divided up in order to provide acceptable and accessible lesson sizes. Someone needs to either revise this text or write a new one; one with lessons of an acceptable size, but which is not dumbed down like Athenaze and yet not unusable like Mastonarde. This text is recomended, but only for an intensive class (hence the name) or as a review text. Not for the general classroom."
5,FORMIDABLE!!!,"Wow, what a great song; In-grid is such a great artist, but unfortunately nobody knows that! The new single ""Oui"" is a very cool & stylish Club-Dance-Song!You have to check out the ""FAVRETTO REMIX"" on this cd!!!!!!!!!!! 80s-HOUSE-SOUND PURE!!!!!!!!! VERY DELICIOUS! It?s my favorite!"
2,Not as good as I had heard,City of Death is one of the highest rated Doctor who episodes and I found it disapointing. I own about 10 ofTom Bakers episodes and I found this one the worst don't get me wrong it is ok but only ok. I would recomend the key to time series and not this one.
5,Doctor Who - City of Death (Episode 105),Big fan of doctor who I have most of them this one has nice filming in paris.A good story line of the doctor.
4,Jaggaroth Heads,"This is a well written story by Douglas Adams. Ward and Baker make a fine showing in this episode which seems, sadly, more interested in showing the BBC's big expense (laugh) at filming in Paris rather than developing the story further. All in all it has a good plot and even better ending. CHEERS - Acting, Storyline JEERS - There is no way that Cabbage head fits into the Human mask!"
1,Ripped off; 2 copies of xtras but no Program!,"Be wary of buying this online as there are a number of units that give you 2 copies of the extras ABOUT the episode but you don't get the DVD that actually has the episode on it! I got ripped off by someone else reselling this used so they knew they were selling me a bogus product so naturally I didn't get my money back. Be wary of buying this used though at least with a retailer you have more chance for recourse if you get a bum set. I didn't attempt to watch till long after I bought it so the excuse the guy used with Amazon was I waited too long, grrrr. Knowing the ethics of the modern transnationals these days I wouldn't be surprised if a number of deliberately defective units were put together this way so folks would be steered by publicity to only buying new rather than used units!"
2,Release has faulty labeling on the packaging,"Ive bought this dvd three times and all three time I had to return it, it seems that there was an error in the manufacturing process rendering some of the disc one discs. It appears that everyone of the time I bought this two disc set, both discs are the same (supplement discs), even though both are correctly labeled disc one and two. So buyers beware, im kinda of leary in trying to buy another in the hopes of getting a proper set. Obviously there are proper sets floating around or else there would'nt be so many positive reviews."
5,The Second Douglas Adams Dr Who story on DVD!,"Adams co-wrote this with producer Graham Williams, based on a story outline by David Fisher (causing it to be transmitted under the pseudonym ""David Agnew""). Sadly, Lalla Ward and Tom Baker both declined to participate in bonus features, but fortunately there was still plenty of material to justify a 2 disc release!Here is a list of the bonuses:Commentary with actors Julian Glover and Tom Chadbon, along with the story's director, Michael Hayes.""Paris in the Springtime"" - 45 minute featurette, covering the production of the story.""Paris, W12"" - a 20 minute behind-the-scenes look at the studio shooting for this story.""Prehistoric Landscapes"" - covering the model work.""Chicken Wrangler"" - covering the problems of having a live chicken on set.""Eye on... Blatchford"" - following Sardoth, second to last of the JagarothThe ENTIRE 1980 Doctor Who Annual in PDF format.Photo Gallery, On-Screen Production Notes, and Easter Eggs!"
1,No Movie!,"This DVD came with 2 discs, one was suppose to have the movie and the other was bonus extras. The discs were labeled Disc 1 & Disc 2, but they were identical and only had the bonus extras. There was no disc with the movie. Very disappointed. I even paid extra shipping to get this in time for a reunion party with some friends and we never got to see the feature movie."
5,Woodstock center finder,i recieved this item in exactly the right time. It arrived in good shape and the packaging was great. It was the right price and I am enjoying it right now
5,Fifteen Years of Good Cooking!,"My daughter gave me this book shortly after it was published... purchased it on a trip to Colorado and the book has been a favorite of mine.It's a bit messy now, with folded pages, frequent notations, splatters and splashes but still loved. The photography is excellent. The recipes are easy to follow and use common ingredients and provide great recipes for entertaining.Some of my favorites: Vegetarian Chipotle Chili, Southwestern Caesar, Glazed Peppers with Almonds, Herb Roasted Vegetables, Cinco Bean Bake (see photo).This book is as good today as it ever was..."
4,Live by the Truth,This book has so many quotes that make you think and review your life. This book offers some of the greatest quotes and has helped me help others explore all of their possibilities.
5,A Blessing To Own,This book is good enough to place next to your bedside along with your bible. Rev. Run's positive affirmations teaches and makes smoother the rocky road to guide us through this maize in life.
5,What a wonderful way to start the day,"I LOVE THIS BOOK!! This book is wonderful. After a good morning prayer, I read the words in this book and they give me inspiration for the day. His words are simply and easy to understand. I often find myself reading page after page. I have given it to several friends as gifts and they are enjoying as much as I am. I highly recommend it!!"
4,A typical Harlequin Superromance - fast and fun!,"If you're looking for deep thoughts that will teach you something about life, obviously you're looking in the wrong section of Amazon books! I like to read these books after a long day of working with folks who have truly serious, disastrous events/emotions with which they're struggling. Brenda Novak created the town of Dundee and then wrote truly fascinating stories of each character. Of course they fall in love, experience some entanglement with outside forces that drive them apart, and then have a happily ever after ending, and this is totally satisfying for the reader! I have bought all the Dundee books, and enjoy Ms Novak's storytelling."
5,a great book,This was a wonderful book.I loved it.All of Brenda Novaks books take you into the story and you can see everything she writes about and totaly picture it.Brenda is a wonderful writer.Can't wait for your next book Brenda keep up the good work.
3,Not riveting but interesting enough,"All of the books that I've read by Ms. Novak are all similar to me. They're entertaining enough, but not riveting. I love to read, and I have to have something to read at the ready, and this book fit the bill."
4,Great love story.,Good romance. It kept my interest from beginning to end. I don't read many romance novels but when I do Brenda Novak is one of the authors I look for.
4,a husban of her own,i like the story line and easy reading also i like reading when the author brings in old people from other books.
5,Buy This DVD For Your Mom,"Mommie Dearest pulls out all the stops and outdoes her ""Baby Jane"" performance. I like the way they show her character ""twenty years ago"" and rather than use a young actress to play her she plays herself! Too much!!The extras are excellent: the backstory on the making of the film and the make-up and costume screen tests for Miss Crawford. Worth the price of the DVD alone.Lose your mind and lose your head to this classic of hag cinema."
5,Great old movie!,"Both my wife and I love the old B&W movies and this one is a classic, if you are a Joan Crawford fan this one is a must. They are making so many remakes these days and this one definately takes you back. It is dated but as I said if you enjoy the old ones this one is a good addition to the Joan Crawford collection!"
4,A Classic Film of its Time,"Oh this film is just too much to bear! It is such a classic that Crawford weidling an axe is now a common T-shirt icon! Crawford over-acts as usual and it's wonderful! I wished I had been in the studio during the filming! She goes from neurotic to wacko to nicey-dicey to literally 'dicey'! That shadowy scene with the axe is the essence of cheap film-shlock! The head bopping is so Hollywood low budget, I screamed with laughter! But the highlight is when Crawford ""dresses up"" and tries to seduce her daughter's boyfriend! Oooh! My skinned just CRAWLED! I loved it! But then, I love John Waters films, too."
3,battle-axe,"The star, Joan Crawford, and the period (early 60s) makes this work.It's shuddery and creepy, though shlocky/cartoonish.If it's not the best really bad movie ever made, then it's certainly close.It's undeniably fun, but it's not even William Castle's best work, for goodness sake... Imagine if he'd really done a better job on this film without leaving all the responsibility to Joan."
1,Just Awful,"Back when Joan Crawford and Bette Davis were the ""Queens of Horror"" in the 1960's, both made some hideously bad choices. ""Strait Jacket"" is a prime example of this. Crawford plays Lucy Harbin, looking ridiculous in a black wig, annoying jangly jewelry, and skimpy dress, who comes home to find her husband in bed with another woman. Grabbing a conveniently available axe, she hacks them to death and goes to the Nut House for 20 years, only to be released to the care of her daughter (Diane Baker), who just as conveniently witnessed the killings as a little girl. When some new axe murders start happening, Lucy is suspected, but the true culprit is..well..guess who ? The axe murder scene is hilarious and is the high point of the film - rivaled only by Joan's shameless aggression towards her future son-in-law, while guzzling booze. There are'nt enough of these moments, however, to make this film work even as camp."
3,JOAN!,"You'll love the moments of ""axting"" in this film. The camp is negated by Joan's acting skill. The camp re-enters with the crappy supporting cast and and great! special effects. This film drones on pointlessly. You'll find yourself wanting more action for you dollar. The film is worth your ""C"" notes though, for Ms. Crawford is the reason we all live today."
3,crawford was scary!!!,bummed thought it was going to be a cool classic. not sorryi bought it. just sorry at the over plot of the film. iknew who it had to be early on. not convincing weirddesperate attempt to patch the pieces together atthe end. motive is a joke! crawford over played the role.
5,Joan's first encounter with the AXE,"We've all seen Mommie Dearest. It's obvious that Tina took lots of things from her mother's movies to create that psychotic, yet comedic portrayal of her mom. Well, this gem of a film is loaded with Mommie Dearest source material. A must-have for any Crawford fan!"
3,"Cheesey, campy fun, but not a thriller.","The first three minutes are great. Unfortunately, the movie slumps from that point onward, and the final scene explaining everything we have just seen is pat and annoying. This movie is a plodding derivative of Psycho and ultimately is not suspenseful. On the other hand, Joan Crawford is alarmingly scary when she switches from self-doubting, asylum refugee to an overripe, vampy Mrs. Robinson, or when she becomes a hysteric defender of her daughter's welfare. George Kennedy is also suitably eerie. See the movie for the two of them, or see it as part of a trilogy with Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. But don't expect to be thrilled by the mystery---the whole film is painfully obvious!"
5,The product was great,"Fantastic!!! Very useful. Light weight but secure. I will recommend it for bunker beds ! Easy to install, easy to put"
4,"""The Voice"" continues to impress.",Glenn Hughes just keeps on getting it. Another wonderful album with live versions of some of his current material as well as some great songs from the Trapeze and Deep Purple catalog. His voice continues to define Rock singing and he and his band keep it all rollin.
3,"Music great, producers/directors fail","Great musical recording, but as others have noted, the whole camera shooting with weird effects is such an annoyance, would love to see it rereleased without that crap."
5,I could taste the wine and cheese,I have been to france many times and Michelle's story brought it all back to me. Her descriptions of the trials and tribulations made me wonder if I could ever be as brave as they were to take all this on. It was fabulous as her words helped me to remember the beauty of the landscape and the thoughts of the food and wine made my stomach growl. What a great story and a very easy and fun read.
4,Gutsy Gal,"Having just reached the age when Ms Caffrey abandoned her profession and life as she knew it to become a ""barge and breakfast"" owner, I am impressed by her guts and courage. Foreign country, foreign language, foreign lifestyle.......and at a time when most of us are settling into the familiar routine that will last the rest of our lives. Her descriptions of the whole barge experience...from buying it, remodeling it and then cruising the canals with it is both entertaining and educational. Great descriptive writing brings the book to life and makes you want to book a cruise on ""Imagine"" -- as well as break out of my routine and try something exciting and new -- even at my age!"
5,Sign Me Up For A Cruise!,"Baby Boomer Alert! Here is one boomer that you can be proud of! Changed her life, changed her world and wrote about it! Loved the narrative and the clever descriptions and detailing made me feel right there with her and ""Imagine"". If you are bored with your life, read this book! It is inspiring and educational.....just might make you do something extraordinary too. Bravo, Michelle!"
4,Power (Spice) Girls,I bought this DVD because I wanted to have vidoes by the Spice Girls together and solo. Here's my review of their videos on this DVD:Spice Girls - Stop: I love this song and this video a lot. It is so much fun. Makes you wish you were there to experience the former fun that was the Spice Girls. The lyrics and the harmonies of the song are fantastic. A nice tribute to the Sound of Motown days.Geri Halliwell - Lift Me Up: I like this song. It is very relaxing. The beginning of the video shows that by her driving in a car in the country but then the video gets really silly with the introduction of those little aliens that stay the remainder of the video.Melanie C. - Never Be The Same Again featuring Lisa'Left Eye'Lopez from TLC /Melanie C. - Northern Star:I don't necessarily understand the rhythm and lyrics to these songs by Melanie C. but I like her voice and the videos are really cool to watch. Really nice computer graphic enhancements.
2,Albatross,"This sounds like a book by the same author called ""Albatross"" which was published several years ago. Soon after the events described, John Rousmaniere wrote a compelling article in SAIL which I have never forgotten, so when the book came out I sought it out eagerly. I was disappointed. While it is an interesting story from which sailors can learn alot, I ended up not caring what happened to any of the characters. I am not sure why not; it was just that somehow the book left me flat."
4,hey hey!!!,It fits and looks great on my bike ... Now to hit the roads and show it off.. time for some fun..
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews, I was anxious to get this book. As a teacher in an inner city school, however, I find it disappointing. It's simplistic view of how easy it is to stop the bully is unrealistic. As someone who deals with this issue every day, I know that simply asking them to tell an adult is not enough."
5,Quick Reading With A Great Learning,"This book is very important and timely for any child, parent and teacher to discuss again and again. It should be in every school library, especially. The author has reached out for all of us to hear. Wonderful."
2,Very simple. Lack of more information.,The story about bullying is very simple. It doesn't provide enough information for a kid to understand why he has been bullied. It should explain about the bully. Why some kids enjoy hurting others physically and emotionaly. This info will help the victim to feel better. Most of the bully are not loved at home and they let the frustration out at school.
1,"Killer Instinct is worth what it cost, very little.","""Killer Instinct"" is the opposite of the dust cover description. If you are looking for drama, mystery, and action, look elsewhere."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I am a fan of the strong female lead and since Lee Childs wrote an introduction of sorts to this book I bought it, thinking that Zoe might be (perhaps a distant and murky and of a lineage thrice removed but still) a relation to Jack Reacher and his approach to life. It was not so. Zoe is a person all her own, but for me she is drawn in blurry strokes, I am not entirely sure what she is, and I have no interest in reading more about her.The entire book reminded me of old-style British mysteries, for some reason."
2,A Slow Read,"There were a number of reviews about this book that were over the top. (I wonder if they actually read the book) I was expecting a fast paced and exciting read. I was dissapointed. It plugs along and never seems to generate much energy. The characters are well presented, but the plot just plods along.... You keep wondering if the plot is going to pick up and go somewhere..."
2,Killer Instinct,"It was free to download. I tried, I really did, couldn't get past the 1st 20 pages. I really don't like anything British anyway. Sorry."
5,"Jack Reacher, meet Charlie Fox","Zoe Sharp has rapidly become one of my favorite authors. Crisp writing, lightning fast action, and one of the toughtest heroines out there. I liked it so much I bought Christmas gift copies for family members to get them started. Be prepared to spend some sleepless nights running through the series at breakneck speed. I will definitely be going back for another round."
4,"Zoe, Killer Instinct","Killer Instinct, ""Charlie Fox"" Book 1. This read turned out to be a pleasant surprise after nearly not purchasing as I have not had too many Female Authors that I have enjoyed. Reading the reviews swayed me into giving it a try.and I will now be definitly reading book 2 in the ""Charlie Fox"" series. She is an interesting Character and fits into the ""Jack Reacher"" mould for coolness under pressure and whit! but as you can immagine does not have the physical toughness of Reacher but is able to make up for this in ways that are quite interesting. As for me it is a must read."
4,Charlie Fox is a standout character,I am so glad I stumbled upon Zoe Sharp and her wonderful character of Charlie Fox. This book was very exciting and Charlie is so multi-faceted that I look forward to reading much more about her. She is tough and independent yet she also has vulnerabilities (which she is fully aware of) and this amazing inner strength. Can't wait to read more in the series!
3,Killer Instinct,"I chose to read this book based on the forward by Lee Child, whom I love. Although I found Ms Sharp's story engaging and will even give her another try, I had trouble with some of the british terminology. I found myself having to go look up what different terms meant prior to continuing the story. I understand she is British and I am American, so that fault falls solely on my shoulders I guess.I liked the character, Charlie Fox. And, although I rooted for her all through the story, I would like to have seen her succeed in ""getting the bad guy"" in more of her encounters, for my taste.And finally, I guess after you've read so many suspense/adventure novels you learn to project endings and wait to see if you were right. I am afraid I was able to do that far too early in the story. I am not quite sure what gave it away, possibly the the way the villian's persona was introduced.All in all I did enjoy this book and will, as I noted above, read others by this author."
1,Recommendations,"I bought this book because Lee Child recommended it. It was a huge disappointment. I just could not relate to the story, the characters, the writing style, everything. I would not recommend it to anyone who loves Lee Child's writing."
2,not the best,This is ok - a wanna be in the action book realm. I always give at least two stars to any author no matter what I thought of the book because they followed through and got their book published. The continuity is fine - the writing style is not as crisp and 'mature' as you wish it were. I was intrigued by the Lee Childs review and disappointed in him afterwards. I won't be reading anymore in this series and I won't take any more sales advice from Lee Childs (even though I a will definitely read his books!).
4,New Hero with Real Grit,This is the first Charlie Fox novel and is a bit raw - and this really works. Charlie is a mixture of hard and soft that could sound cliche but not the way Sharp writes it. Start of great things ...
2,Not sure I have the stomach for it...,"As other reviewers mentioned, I too was drawn in by the advertised foreword by Lee Child, whose books I enjoy. However, I second the use of the adjective ""inexplicable"" to describe it.While I applaud the idea of a strong, take-no-prisoners female who can compete in what is often portrayed as a macho world---and rooted for Charlie throughout, the amount of gore and protracted violence was definitely not my cup of chai. I cannot stomach people of either gender getting beaten to the proverbial pulp.As a character, Charlie never quite grabbed me...she seemed to be either falling apart or tearing things apart. I placed her in the ""damaged goods"" category, more fueled by anger than common sense.I cannot recommend the book to others but will check out the author's next free download or two to see if I find them more palatable.Regardless of my evaluation of the story line, I appreciated the fact that there were no typos :-)"
3,"Good, with reservations - A decent 1st book.","I like the character of Zoe, she's smart, tough, independent and has been through a rough time. Unfortunately, she's the only really developed character is the book. She's also supposed to be in her mid-40's, but seemed about 10 years younger than that. The story itself is good, but I had two major problems. First, it's not hard to figure out who's behind the crimes and, second, the author way overuses the ""had I but known"" device at the end of chapters. But it's the first book of the series, so I'll hope the subsequent books are better. Still, it's a decent first book.Correction (4/2010): Apparently, I was wrong on her age and she is in her 20s. That is certainly more in keeping with the character and her actions. I have, therefore, upgraded my rating from 2.5 to 3 stars. Thanks to those who caught my error, the the site won't let me change the stars at the top."
3,Killer Instinct,I based my purchase on the Lee hild reccommendation. Not as good and does not hold my attention. I do not believe I would buy another
1,Killer Instinct,This is the first book that I tried to read in this series and I did not like the first 4 chapters so went to the next book in the series and so on and did not get into any of them.
2,boring,"writer started out well, than the whole plot became confusing,herdetails about the miltary justice system, was not researched, the supergirlapproached just did not work"
1,Commonplace,"This reminded me of most of the lightweight jr. high curricula out there. It lacked a spark of creativity and originality, and seemed more the work of someone who was just trying to generate books to supply his publishing company.I used this with my youth group at church and got mediocre feedback."
3,A triumph of his own style,"An amazing book with a stylish touch that explores the paradox of the self that can never know itself; in the very act of observing itself the self splits in two, an observing consciousness and an object that is being observed. The self perceives itself as a stream of words, a narration. Each time it tries to catch up with itself, it merely turns into another story, thus putting before the reader a succession of storytellers. A must-read for anyone who cares about literature and who think that it still matters."
3,Bad audio mastering ruins the show,"I had earlier seen this concert on DVD with DTS mastering. The current disc unfortunately uses Dolby Digital for its audio and what a disappointment it is.In fact, part 2 of the disc appears definitely flawed with the sound appearing to come from the rear and front left channels, making one wonder if Yanni and the stage is on one's left.Concert otherwise is quite regaling, if one were to consider the music solely."
3,"Yanni - Great Music, Poor video","I've always liked Yanni since I heard his CD ""Yanni - Live at the Acropolis"" some six / seven years ago. I recently purchsed an HDTV, so I decided to purchase the DVD (which I liked when I saw it first on Public TV). I was very disappointed by the video quality. but I still love the music!"
5,Yanni - Live at the Acropolis,I have this concert on VHS. I have this concert on CD. I had to have it on DVD. I am a Yannian! I just made that up. LOL.
5,Yanni is the best,"This is the most wonderful music ever performed, Yanni is a genius. Love it. DVD is back from 1993, but it was a magical enchanting night. Yanni plays with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Karen Briggs as the lead violin player was amazing. This is what launched Yanni's career into the mega star he is still nowadays.Enjoy"
3,Yanni does it again,"Once again Yanni has excelled, his excitement and enthusiasm is so contagious,to watch his DVD is to actually attend his concert!! Get it!!!"
1,"Terrific concert, terrible DVD",I have the original VHS recording and love it. I tried to update with this DVD. The color saturation on this DVD is so overdone that sometimes we were unable to see faces. What a terrible disappointment!
4,Favorite Yanni Concert,"This is still my favorite Yanni concert. I bought it on Laserdisc years ago. My only regret is that the picture quality on DVD is about the same as Laserdisc. This could be due to the original Video production, however. Sound is fabulous. I am satisfied."
2,Yanni - Live at the Acropolis,"This one is not so great. Instead buy ""Yanni Live - The Concert Event"" in Blu Ray. I give full 5 stars to that. It is stunning and I have watched it many times over with guests and friends and still love it."
3,Yanni Live at the Acropolis,"Music and musicians are great. If you can get passed Yanni swooning and snapping his head back you'll enjoy it. Watching Yanni, though, it truly annoying."
5,Excellent CD!!,The dvd was fabulous! Yanni Live at the acropolis is a must have for those of you who enjoy this kind of music. The Quality of the dvd is excellent and you will really enjoy the backstage interviews afterwards.Rick
3,Index error & audio flaw,"Fortunate for other Yanni's fans in USA to receive a perfect audio recording dvd disc. My disc serial no.is L:807-1157 O:001-115-02D. have cracking sound on track no. 2,3 and 5. the index were also wrongly printed. Track no. 2 should be""Until Last Moment, No. 3 ""Key To imagination"", No. 5 ""Felitsa "", No. 7 ""One's man dream "" My agent was not interested in replace it with the other lot"
3,DVD doesn't compare to Laser Disc,"Guess i'm going to have to get my Laser Disc repaired if I'm ever going to hear those explosive passages again. The video and sound were superb on LD, the sound was so brilliant and defining. Whoever did the transfer to DVD ought to be shot. 5.1 sound is OK for planes flying around your house but not music. No one listens to music that way, it's rediculous."
3,"Great music, super setting, poor camerawork","Maybe I should have stuck with the CD. The music and setting for Yanni's seminal concert are first-class. The guy can indeed cover the keyboards, the Royal Philharmonic is the best back-up band you could ask for, and the ""regular"" back-ups aren't shabby, either. And it's the coolest concert venue this side of Red Rocks. But the unimaginative camerawork just about ruins the show. There are precioius few shows of Yanni's hands on the keyboards, too many poorly-framed musician close-ups, and, maybe worst of all, little coordination of music to the video (e.g., when there's a key solo they often don't show the soloist)."
4,Superb,"An inspiring exposure of music, a mixture of the classic symphonics with the accelerating rythms of the new age. A very well integrated mixture of music were every style and instrument is a strong solo and member of an orchestra. Simply sublime..."
4,Yanni tells you a story with music,"When I first heard the music I thought it was in the Efteling. A Dutch themepark. They used the song 'Acroyali/Standing in Motion' in a Lasershow. I was amazed when I first heard this music, so I download the song, and after a while the whole album. But I was so amazed by his music that I bought the whole album!After a I wanna to see the live concert of him, so we called some shops, and we found the vhs of the live concert. I was a whole new experience when I saw the vhs. The violins, the bass-guiter. So I wanna have the dvd too!I found the dvd in the 'Private Years box', so I order it. A few weeks later the box arrived at my door. It was very exciting. But when I saw the dvd I was a little dissapointment.The sound-effects are really good, but the video-quality is poor. The images are al little bit 'sheaky'. I think that they are used the wrong aquipment to put it on dvd.But Yanni is still amazing, and I have already six cds of him :-)"
1,Don't waste your time on this DVD --- a BIG disappointment,"I have been a Yanni fan for quite some time, have all of his recordings, and the VHS version of ""Live at the Acropolis."" I have watched and listened to the VHS tape many, many times and looked forward to the release of the DVD. Finally it came and what a disappointment! The sound is is okay, not great as I expected, but okay. But the picture quality is so bad, with the exception of a few close ups, that it is annoying and makes it almost impossible to enjoy the music. I finally turned the TV off and just listened to the music!"
2,"Buy the VHS, DONOT waste your time with the DVD","When I first saw this concert, it was on the laser disc, and I thought it was incredible. Two years later, I saw it again at a friend's house, and it was on VHS. It also sounded incredible. Then I was looking around in late 1999 for the DVD version, only to find out that if I want it, I need to buy the whole Yanni set. Finally, around early 2000, I got a hold of the DVD version, and was not impressed. The sound quality was poor, the video quality was also poor. Needless to say, I ended up returning the disc."
5,Spectacular - A Yanni Collector's Piece,"The Acropolis concert is a truly spectacular performance. Yanni's genius is on display as he teams with the Philharmonic Orchestra and the music is grand. Although not a recent event, this is a collectors item for all Yanni fans. You can also catch a glempse of Linda Evans (his girlfriend at the time). Although the VCR was good, I am also purchasing the DVD."
5,one of a kind,"I purchased this DVD subsequent to ""Yanni Tribute,"" which was extraordinary and delightful. ""Live at the Acropolis"" is very good listening, but quite different; and therefore, difficult to compare. On its own, I would say it is very good music. It depend on one's taste, and/or mood. One thing I very much appreciate about these two albumns is that there is nothing on them that I feel a need to skip. Live at the Acropolis is a bit more subdued;the music is excellent. I especially enjoy the violins, subtle humor, and good will.This is really a good DVD/CD to have. I am more than pleased."
5,Outstanding concert in my opinion,I have only seen Yanni Live At The Acropolis between 50 and 100 times; so I don't know whether I would become tired of it. In my opinion the entire performance is perfect!!!
2,a nonstop drunk-a-log from start to finish,I like to begin by saying that I absolutly adore Maureen Stapleton as an actress. I've always been a huge fan -- she has been exceptional with every character she has portrayed -- but unless you want to read about a nonstop alcoholic spree -- this isn't the book for you. I wanted to know more about her -- I learned about her alcoholism -- but her memories and backstage tell-alls are uninspired and lackluster -- she doesn't even realize that she's continually focusing on her justification of living a life of an active alcoholic -- I found it extremely sad.
5,A Great Little Unit,"We've been using our Honeywell Air Purifier for a month now and and thus far find it a great little unit. We have it in our bedroom and have been doing some remodeling work in the attached bathroom, consequently, much fine dust is over everything. The unit is doing its job very well...as we can tell by the air in the bedroom and the amount of dust collected on the filter. And filter is a snap to clean, one of the easiest we've ever used. We're very pleased with our Honeywell, it does what the literature claims."
1,Made my house smell like bleach,"I disagree with most of the reviews here, which I unfortunately relied on when I bought this unit. It is loud and puts out ozone. I assume the ozone is the bleach smell that is so disturbing to me. I didn't see this in the item description, but it's all over the owner's manual. The Honeywell help line person was rude, but honest, I think. I was hoping the bleach smell would subside (because no one else mentioned it here), but the Honeywell Rep. said it won't; he agreed that it is ozone. So I'm returning it and ordering two more of the Hamilton Beach units (True Air, about $45) which I like. It's a little smaller, but much quieter."
5,Works well,"I did not realize how much this was helping me with my spring allergies until I walked to church yesterday and my asthma acted up. I was glad to get back home where I can breath better. I was concerned with the reviews I read that this unit would not fit my needs, but it seemed to be the best for the price. I am pleasently surprised at how well it does work."
3,First Impression,The product description on the Amazon website does not mention the fact that this product ionizes the airThis product also does not have a switch to turn-off the ionizerThere is only two setting for the blower fan
5,Great product,This is my second one...the first one came and had a slight strange sound....sent it back...this one is amazing...and u dont ever have to buy a filter....awesome....this thing takes in so much dust...
2,Returned the item,"I really wanted this air purifier to be the right one. Unfortunately, this air purifier is LOUD, which gets annoying after a while. You can hear the motor noise and the wind it creates. It's a pretty little fan, so no wonder it's so loud. If you're worried about noise, I wouldn't get it. I don't know how well it really purifies the air either because after 3 days of using it, I didn't notice any dust on the filters... It looks good and the price is right, but it's not quiet and its effectiveness is uncertain."
1,Way too noisy!,"This machine was purchased to replace a similar machine that burned out and is no longer being manufactured. I had the previous machine for many years and was very happy with it. But, this Honeywell air purifier is very noisy. Then it developed a clicking noise that made it even louder. I returned it and got a Hamilton Beach air cleaner for less money, and it has 3 settings including a whisper quiet mode. I am so much happier with my new machine! I would not buy this Honeywell! I would give it no stars if I could."
5,Small device for a small space!,"I live in a small apartment, which I share with my little cat Murphy. This air purifier is fantastic, with multiple level settings, and I typically run it at night while I sleep. With a built-in filter, I can remove and wash as needed. Relatively quiet, so it doesn't bother me while I'm sleeping or watching television. Nice product."
1,Would work well if it didn't smell so bad,I had high hopes for this unit after reading the reviews. I received it a week ago and have not been able to use it in my house. When I opened the box the unit reeked of new plastic smell to the point that I could not have it in my house. I put it out on the deck to let it air out in hopes the smell would go away. Now a week later it is still sitting outside due to the horrific smell. Not recommended if you have chemical sensitivity problems like me. Sending mine back today. I would also like to note that unlike some of the other Honeywell air purifiers this unit is Made in China.
2,Doesn't purify,"I ordered this product from Amazon and have used it on and off for several months. I would not recommend it based on its performance. I've noticed no change in the bedroom I'm using it in, and have seen hardly any dust or particles collected, checking every few weeks. I'll be looking for another purifier in the next couple of weeks due to continued problems with dust allergies."
4,Nice product,"The air purifier works well even though there are only two settings (hi or lo), but it serves the purpose of cleaning up the air. The fan actually blows out cool air, so the room feels a bit cool. However, it can also dries up the air, so when I use it in the bedroom while I sleep, it caused dryness to my throat. I like the fact that it has the built in cleanable filter, so you don't have to spend extra money on replacing the filters."
1,Don't buy this if you have asthma,This product makes your asthma worse. I bought this product hoping that it would help with my cat allergies but it actually makes things worse because of the ionizer. Even the manual says not to use this if you have asthma. I wish they would have just said so on the product page instead of hiding it in the manual.
3,This device is not very efficient to capture dust,"in my room size 4 x 5 meters I have a problem that goes much dust out, and had a slight improvement after purchasing this appliance, but I expected better results from this, I think I had to buy the Honeywell 50150 Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier."
3,Impressed but...,"Ok so I have only had this filter for 2 days and it has been on the whole time. I'm not sure if it is my imagination but I feel like the air in our apartment is fresher! Unfortunately after doing some research (I want to by another but bigger filter) I discovered on the honeywell website that this unit contains a built in ionizer. Since I have a newborn in the house I don't really feel comfortable with this, and so the unit must go back! I really wish Amazon would have disclosed this information in the product description. Just thought I'd share this information with those of you who do not want or cannot have an ionizer due to respiratory problems."
3,Noisy,A bit dissapointed with the rattle it produces at both high and low settings. Does an OK job for a small room but the noise has me turning it off.
3,"GOOD, NOT QUIET","AM HAPPY WITH THE HFD 010'S PERFORMANCE BUT IT IS ANYTHING BUT QUIET. IT ADVERTISES ITSELF AS QUIET CLEAN,. FOR TWO WEEKS IT WAS QUITE THEN, IT STARTED MAKING NOISES. NOT AS MILD AS WHITE NOISE BUT, MORE LIKE A REPEATING MILD THUMPING NOISE. TOO IRRITATING TO PUT ON HIGH, BUT I RUN IT ALL NIGHT ON LOW. IT DOES A GOOD JOB KEEPING THE DUST OUT OF THE AIR AND I ALSO USE IT WHEN SHOWERING AS IT KEEPS THE MIST OFF OF THE MIRRORS. FOR THE PRICE IT IS A DECENT MACHINE. IF NOISE BOTHERS YOU DON'T BUY IT, BUT IF SOME NOISE PUTS YOU TO SLEEP BY ALL MEANS IT IS THE MACHINE FOR YOU."
3,Tower Air filter,"It's okay, not sure it is working, filter does't seem to get dirty! Maybe that is good! It's quite, and the air smells okay that comes out of the machine!"
2,its drafty!,I have bought a few HEPA's for the babys room. I wanted something quiet but something to add a constant white noise incase the old child woke up in the middle of the night.I like Honeywell in general and I have the big one in the older childs room and its perfect but I dont something so big for the babys room.This one is quiet and its the perfect amount of white noise but its drafty and causes the room to cool down.I havent had it long enough to see how well it cleans
3,Broken bits...,"When the package arrived I opened it and discovered a spring rattling inside the unit. It had been the spring that released the filter, but fortunately it had no effect to its performance. The construction of the plastic was off as well and therefore pieces didn't line up correctly which left cracks and holes around the seams. I'm debating on returning it on the fact that it may fall apart at any given time down the road but on the other hand I suffer from allergies and I wouldn't be able to manage another week of coughing and not sleeping."
2,BEWARE IONIZER,"This model has an ozone producing ionizer. This important detail is not included in the product description and is something that I refuse to accept.But I suppose if you are okay with that, then this product is great for its price and performance.I am ordering another air purifier instead that does not produce any harmful gas."
2,Air Purifier,Much too noisy. I couldn't stand the noise it made long enough to find out how well it cleaned the air.
3,Not what I expected,This is definately quiet but I have a dog and it has not helped get any dust out of the air.
4,Small and quiet,"This unit is exactly as described: compact and quiet. I'm very pleased with the purchase. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's difficult to know how well it's filtering the air. A matter of faith, I suppose."
4,Working Great Thus Far.,"Working great thus far. We bought this product to address, at least in part, our granddaughter's allergy and snoring problems. We were suprised that within a week of using this machine, we noticed a huge reduction in her snoring!I did take the filters out, just to test how easy it would be to clean, and it was a breeze.I'm waiting and hoping that 6 mos. from now this product will continue to work as well as it does. Presently, I'm thoroughly pleased."
3,No bad,"Not bad but it keeps making a low clicking sound when it's on High. Very convenient because I don't have to purchase new filters- all you have to do is pull the filter out, wash, and voila."
4,pretty good,I bought this particular product because of the Honeywell name and I've bought other products they made and was pleased. Over all it does its job and I can tell a difference in the air. The only problem I have with it is its not whisper quite. Its much louder then I expected. It would be fine in any other room but I have it in my bedroom and have it running while I'm sleeping.
5,Works Great,"In less than two hours it had that 'cat box' smell gone. Could not believe it, had my wife check the room and yep all that goodness was gone. It does what I had hoped and that's all I ask. My wife has an aunt with major breathing problems and she noted something different but could not put her finger on what was different. Needless to say wife and I were quite pleased.UPDATE:After five months use it is basically forgotten. Still very quite and only needs cleaning every three months or so. Over Christmas when family was over we were asked what we had done that was different, we looked at each other like 'What"", nothing we could think of. There was no cat box oder and then the light went on so we fessed up. 1200 Sq Ft home and it has removed all that lovely smell."
5,Wonderful,"I have 2 cats with asthma. They live on medication to control their symptons, but still wheeze all winter long once the windows are closed. I read the reviews and decided to try this. First of all, it is whisper quiet. Within one hour from turning this on, both cats stopped wheezing and have not wheezed since. While they will always need their medication, this little unit seems to really help them to breathe more comfortably. One of the cats actually sat in front of it almost immediately (unit very quiet), it was as if he could tell he was breathing easier. This unit is remarkable and well worth the price. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Product,This shipped and arrived at my place very quickly. It's super easy to use and removes a lot of the dust in my place.
4,It's a good little workhorse.,"I chose this because my bedroom is always musty due to the of the location of the air conditioner vents and seems to be the only room that collects dust so quickly after cleaning. I've had many purifiers in there, and this one is the best. I like the fact that I don't have to buy expensive replacement filters. It's quiet but it makes great white noise. The air flow out of the front is fantastic, if I turned it towards my bed it would double as a fan. The only reason it dosen't get 5 stars is because it makes things smell a little like plastic. Maybe this would go away after washing the filters."
4,Good little filter!,"The air cleaner has been running contineously since 7 Dec 09 and is still running. The filter is very easy to remove and the pre-filter is very easy to clean. Operation is very simple, 3 settings- off, low, high. I've had mine running on low since high is much louder. With it on low I am able to sleep even with it only a few feet away. It doesn't have any of the features of more expensive filters such as UV or ion, however more expensive models are available if that is important. I'm currently deployed to Kosovo and the air quality is very poor. I got sick a few weeks after arriving, purchased this air filter, and have not been sick since. I don't think this filter cured me, but sleeping in a better atmosphere may have helped me recover quicker and stay healthier. It definately didn't hurt!"
4,Quieter than most !,"I've had the old Sharper Image air cleaners, and they are totally quiet. I tried a few other brands and they were very loud, comparably. This unit is the most quiet I have found yet, and I do recommend. Noise is an issue with me. This does generate some noise, yet it's very tolerable."
2,Loud and does not do much,I have 2 hamilton beech units that powerful and 3 speeds. This unit has 2 loud speads and cant tell the difference. The HB model cleans the air of oders. This unit just makes noise
2,Waste of Money.,I'm going to have to disagree with most here. Its unfortunate because I purchased based on the many good reviews.The filter on this thing is VERY coarse and captures maybe nearby airborne pet hair but any more cleaning of the air and YOU will be disappointed.
1,black dust on the tv screen,"this product makes a mess on everything from tv to a/c fliter , whats going on in my lungs. honeywell this sucks"
1,Did not filter smoke,I purchased this product for my mother. She used it once and found that it would not filter cigarette smoke. I returned it to Amazon. The return process was very easy. I expect a full refund soon.
2,not that good,i don't notice the difrence it has been running for over a week no difference in air if i didn't get it free i would send it back
5,A great theoretical review.,I bought this book to help me review theories of language acquisition. It is well-written and an easier read than the textbook I bought for my TESL methodology course. I recommend this book to anyone reviewing for a TESL comprehensive exam. It is not the book for you if you are looking for practical teaching tips.
4,The New 5th Edition,"Given the heavy-duty subject matter, Brown's ""Principles of Language Learning and Teaching"" is probably about as good as it gets. It's definitely not a book of general interest, but rather a compendium of the various theories that have influenced and shaped the teaching of second languages in the 20th century. It's slow going, but after a one semester course during which I plowed through and digested the material, I've gained a general understanding of the theory behind the practice. Babyboomers like me who had an unhappy second language experience in school will smile while reading Brown's explanations of the theories of the 50's, 60's and 70's, and why so many of us became discouraged. As a teacher of ESL now, I can only say things have improved a lot. In this new edition, Brown has included a section in the last chapter on current hot topics in the field. But again, this is for professionals or students, not general readers."
4,Class textbook,I was required to purchase this book for FOUNDATIONS OF TESOL class. I found it very interesting and will be using it throughout my career.
3,"A little slow, but a good story","This book had all the makings of a good story, until the author got bogged down in little details and twists and turns. For a romance novel, I had to pay a suprising about of attention to little details that I normally would over look. But to the same extent, I also skipped two chapters in the middle and was able to catch back up with little difficulity. I found that the book started out good, but toward the middle it kind of faded and started to get old. It was a real disappointment for such a good begining. On the whole though, the book was well written and for the most part interesting. A good book if you have the time to give the book the attention that it needs."
1,total waste of money,"it starts out bad but some books get better later in the story. guess what? it got worse. it just talks about a stupid prophecy that never happens in the story. the main idea is good but theres nothing to back it up. if u want a steamy love story this isn't it. theres only one love scene in the book. the author also uses fossil words like 'twas, 'twill and m'lord. i'm usually openminded and like all kinds of books but htis one was just a waste of time. if u wanta good book turn to dara joy."
4,American Caesar,American Caesar Is great read on flawed General. Douglas Mac Arthur. whether you like him are not . You will learn alot
5,WOW.....was that us this book is about!,"My wife was given this book by the Social Worker in our NICU...I just read the first paragraph and couldn't put it down...each description, physical and emotional is exactly what my wife and I are going through...I am going to order another copy and give it to our ""premie"" daughter when she is old enough to fathom what me, my wife, and her went through. This book is a MUST for all parents enduring this rollercoaster of a ride...."
2,Good At first,I liked this product at first simply because it was so small and convenient to have but now that i've had it for some time i'm a bit disappointed. It's way slow and it sometimes doesn't even register on my Mac computer. But i guess i got what i paid for.
3,I forgot why I bought this thing,I have never used this unit and I can't even remember why I bought it so I can't give any advise.
2,Still Waiting for a True Resurrection,"Oh my God, Wayne...What are you doing? This album sounds as though you got drunk and decided to sit down with a bunch of tapes and a casio and decided upon a ""Greatest Hits"" Album. Be it, the songs originally are great..but leave them alone already. This sounds like Mission Musak. What makes this effort worse is that they chose Cleopatra records, pushing them further into the Has Been pile. I will always cherish the Mission's music (I even liked ""Neverland"") Just not this one."
2,What went wrong?,"These songs are remakes of the originals, be aware.This album just fuels the fire of my theory that early Mission was great when Simon was in the band. Nothing was the same after Simon left. I'm not sure what happened with this recording. It sounds like it was quickly whipped up to meet some contract obligation. The Mission was great live and bootleg recording capure the magic better than this album. There was something magic about the band, the songs just had feeling, it's too bad it was all lost in this recording. Stay away."
5,Before the Bus Ran out of Gas,"This has been my most favorite Partridge Family LP next to their debut ""ALBUM"". It took a new and departed musical direction under the guidance of Wes Farrell.I can't understand how and why not a single from this LP ever cracked the TOP 40. ""Rollercoaster"",""Looking For A Good Time"",and a few others would have made great hits. Now if someone at ARISTA would wake up and release this long awaited LP on to cd,it would complete any Partridge Family fan's collection."
4,A Partridge Family album I didn't have. :-),It was fun finding a new album when I thought I had them all. Now my collection is complete. Some of the songs I knew but some were new.
5,Pamela grace,I am a huge David Cassidy fan and I loved watching the PF shows. I never new this DVD was out until about a month ago. I was delighted to find it and I have been listening to it all week.
4,Wonderful,The Partridge Family's last album was pretty good although it didn't sell well and it's hard to find on vinyl but it you loved their other albums you should get this one as well.
5,The Best Of All the Partridge Releases,"Having waited for this release for YEARS, it was great that someone outside of BMG decided to take a stand and remaster this last Partridge release and allow it to see the light of day ! Now if we could only get all the unreleased PF, that would be amazing. Since I have an unplayed still sealed LP that I copied onto CD format, from what I can hear the mastering job is quite phenomenal and really allows you to enjoy each and every instrument more clearly then what was originally heard in its original release back in the day. Great work to all the parties involved that did such a smash up job in getting this out there and in such a phenomenal state !"
2,Missed Opportunity,"Kutless is undeniably blessed with musical talent. Produced by Aaron Sprinkle (of Poor Old Lu and solo artist fame), they seemed to be lined up for a successful rockin' worship album. Alas, for reasons unknown the band released too little creative license to make any of the selected tracks stand out. For example, ""Take me in"" is the perfect song for Kutless, just begging for a 2nd stanza to be written. Instead, the band simply repeats the 1st stanza over again...exactly like they performed it 30 seconds ago. ""Word of God Speak"" is too new to be covered...everyone still likes the original. Instead, I would rather have seen the talents of Kutless applied to some youth group favorites like ""I Surrender"" or a Promise Keepers tune like ""Knowing You."" Maybe next time...Will you listen over and over again? Probably not. Highly recommend Jars of Clay's ""Redemption Songs"" instead."
1,Bland and unoriginal,"If you're going to do an album consisting entirely of cover versions of well-known worship songs, then you need to give it some distinctiveness in order to make it stand out from the rest. But this doesn't - it's just a set of unoriginal and uninspiring carbon copies. There's nothing wrong with the choice of songs, but there's nothing distinctively Kutless about their presentation - this could have been created by a band of anonymous Nashville session musicians and it would have sounded exactly the same. It seems that the band checked their creativity out at the door when they went into the stuiod to make this one."
3,The Nickelback worship album?,"This is cooler and somewhat harder-rocking than most praise albums, and that gets it an extra star - so 3 instead of only 2. That said, I've heard Kutless rock a lot harder than on this CD, so I was expecting something pretty heavy. Sadly, I'm a bit disappointed. Other than a couple of cool exceptions (""I Lift My Eyes Up,"" ""Word of God Speak""), this sounds exactly like Creed, Nickelback, Hoobastank, etc. If I didn't know it was Kutless, I'd've never guessed.Again, it's still cooler than 3/4 of the other worship albums out there, but it doesn't nearly live up to Kutless' potential."
1,The Problem With Special Editions,"Alright, I loved the regular edition, but didn't own it. So this comes out, and I pay seven bucks for three more songs that what I would have gotten. I wish I would have gotten the regular edition. Because this is a pathetic excuse for a special edition, in fact, it's just plain lazy.You get three ""New"" songs, I had high hopes for ""We Exalt Thee"". Kutless just got lazy on it. It could have been so much more, it could have been a great worship moment. What do you get instead? Awkwardness. I thought ""My Savior, My God"" was a cover of Aaron Shust's hit. It isn't, I don't know where it came from, but it's very poorly done. The singing is bad, and the retention of the song is a little under two seconds, but not much less. The last song? The live version of ""Strong Tower"" that was from the live CD, which Kutless fans already have.Overall, a useless, pathetic, lazy excuse for a special edition. Get the regular edition, because this is just plain embarrasing."
1,Disappointed,"As mentioned by some others, I was expecting these guys to rock out these praise songs. They chose a great set to play, but they didn't do anything particularly special with the songs.I look forward to their next album, but this one was on the bland side."
2,Used same studio track from 2nd CD,"I love Kutless, they truly rock. One thing about this CD is that it just doesn't have the emotion like their other CDs did. Also, most of the songs were worship songs already done by others"
1,"Bland, bland, bland","They were going through some blah years I guess when they recorded this one and ""Sea of Faces"". Usually praise and worship songs stir the soul but I found this CD lacking in the thing I like best in musicians - emotion. The sound of the songs ground me down. Kutless' ""Strong Tower"" really started to lean by the end of the CD. I was actually glad when it was over!! It has since gone on my CD shelf and hasn't gone into my CD player again. Maybe I can sell it on Amazon or some auction site? Hmmmmm"
3,Great Songs Poor Singing and Style.,I listened the Cd the sound is weak and milky. Jon Mich Smith needs singing education he is tone deaf. He sings some these songs he messed up he needs to listen to The Rock King Elvis . He needs to decrease the bass and electrical guitar and drums . He needs to improve his voice for a smooth Elvis Voice needs to have more better sounding instraments . Worship is not about rock it's about worship the lord beafuly he need's to improve . Don't buy the Hearts of the Innocent. He needs to dress nicer than that. He follows my opinion he will be on a higher list.
1,I'm absolutely astonished...,"...at the success this band has enjoyed. Or perhaps ""confounded"" would be more accurate. This album doesn't have a drop of creativity or originality in it. Kutless, for the unfamiliar, play basically the exact same kind of ""post-grunge"" pop rock that Creed did, with more obviously worshipful, Christian lyrics. Normally I don't have a problem with Christian music, but there's not a single lyric, melody, or guitar riff on this album that hasn't been done a thousand times before. If you want intelligent worship music, check out The Violet Burning, Rock n' Roll Worship Circus, or even Sixpence None the Richer. If you don't mind the same unimaginative praise choruses CCM artists have been singing for the last 30 years set to bland power chords, though, this is the album for you."
5,Absolutely Awesome CD,"I purchased this CD after hearing a few of their music on the Fish Station in Orange County. I absolutely fell in love with the music. I've been looking for this type of music within the Contemporary Christian genre for a long time and I finally found it with this band. I went out to buy their other CD, Kutless, and haven't stop listening to it for the past 4 weeks. Absolute gem!!"
4,Thundering Praise,"I enjoyed this CD. The praise and worship standards seem fresh and new. Guitar work is confident and strong. I especially liked ""Take me Back"", and ""Better is One Day"". Kutless' version of ""Word of God Speak"" is also excellent. I like it every bit as much as the original artist's version, if not more."
5,This album is completely amazing!!!,"This is one of the best worship cd's I have ever purchased. These guys really did a great job on this cd. Even though most of these songs are just remakes it still rocks to hear the Kutless style to these fabulous songs. ""We fall down"" and ""better is one day"" are simply classics on here, they really did a great job putting those two songs together. The other songs are amazing too, they just really had their act together on this cd. ""Strongtower"" is a song they wrote, it's quite frankly my fav. worship song ever, its' so good that I would buy the cd just for that song. Your not though, your buying a ton of great worship music that glorifies our Lord."
5,one of the best photography books i've ever seen!,"I baught LaChapelle Land, and i was so amazed at the pictures. I think David is the best photographer, cause he has a great imagination, and all his pictures are unique. His pictures of not like the normal, boring white backround, their different, and just great. The people he uses are not drop dead gorgous, but he makes them look good by concentrating on one part of them. David has inspired me to study photography, and someday, I hope he'll be taking pictures of me! HA I wish. Keep doing great work David, I love your pictures!! :)"
5,This book is the awesomest!,"I adore David LaChapelle's work! I love how he uses colors, and his interesting subjects. His photos are beautiful. Does he have a website?"
4,A gift for my neice,"I bought this gift for my niece. She said she likes it. My child's friend has a ""house"" and still plays with it almost a year later.I think it looks entertaining, not the best value for what you get. I paid $30."
3,"Reasonable Price, Poor Quality","I picked this up on Amazon as a last minute gift for my little girl...and she was increadibly excited to get it. She loved playing with it on Christmas day. It worked fine that first day...but, by the second day, she came carrying it to me compaining of glitches in the picture. The Pixel Chick's body wasn't lining up. The only way we seem to be able to fix it is to shut it down and restart it...which lasts for just a few minutes. Then the problem returns. Unfortunately, it's just no fun when a toy is that troublesome. She won't play with it any longer, and it's a week old."
1,Problems w/toy,"My daughter received the Salon & Pet Shop as a gift from her grandparents for Christmas. During shopping mode, only half of the girl's body would display so that you could not see what she was pointing at. We returned it to Amazon, and they sent a replacement. We never could get the replacement out of demo mode, so my daughter was unable to play with it. We also returned this item and are awaiting resolution of our problem. So far Amazon's customer service has been great regarding the problem. My daughter is hoping for a refund so that she can buy something else as a gift from her grandparents for Christmas.We also cannot understand how we could receive two items in a row that would not work. My daughter has had a Pixel Chix house for years, and it has always worked properly. Mattel must have a manufacturing problem with the Love 2 Shop Mall."
1,Pixel Chix Mall- Salon and Pet Shop,"I am ten years old. I have two other pixel chix houses. I got this one for Christmas and was disappointed because it wasn't very fun and there weren't a lot of options in the game. Also, I did everything there was to do in the game in about five minutes."
3,This is kind of a dumb toy.,"My daughter and I both thought that Pixel Chix were neat, so I bought one for her and my neice. The novelty quickly wore off. Basically, the chix work to earn money and buy cute stuff through problem solving and mini-games. Unfortunately, the programming is poor and it becomes extremely repetitive.Both girls prefer Bratz Diamonds for the GameBoy Advance. The game has the same premise, but is by far superior to the pixel chix."
4,FABULOUS FUN,I bought this toy for my 7 yr old daughter for Christmas along with an automobile and it is really cute. She can't seem to put it down. It is adorable and entertaining. I highly recommend this line over the other computer pet toys that are out there.
4,"Good, but not Great",Both of the malls I have sometimes don't show the whole body of the girl. It shows just the head or a blur where the body should be. I like to play it along with the 2 story house and the car. (quoted from my 10 year old daughter)
5,Highly Recommended,"My 8 year old daughter absolutely loves this! She has a couple of the houses and one of the cars.......this one is even better! This is a perfect gift for any girl between the ages of 5-10....or in some cases, like my brother in law who picked it up and played with it for over an hour....even older....lol"
1,Disappointed,Never really had an to opportunity to find out what kind of product this is. Bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. Did not work properly only could see the body of the person.
2,Not long lasting,It stopped being comfortable and doesn't fully raise up to maximum height after 1 year of use. The fabric is long lasting though.
5,atomic watch,very attractive and quite functional. Only drawback is that watch band was made for the largest wrist possible and it cost me an additional $15.00 at a local watch store to have it sized properly.
3,A little too big,"It seems like a nice watch for the money but it's too thick and bulky for me. Also, the instructions are confusing."
5,I thoroughly enjoyed this topical thriller!!,"With this book, Mr. Koeper again displays his special talents for creating multi-dimensional and thoroughly believable characters and intriguing story lines that keep you wanting more. Murder, intrigue and politics (international, national and office) all play a role in this topical thriller with characters worth caring about.Having now read Mr. Koeper's first two books, I can't wait for the next one."
5,There is no let down with Koepers second book,Once more Koeper writes a thriller that keeps you guessing the entire book. As his characters come to life you feel like you have met them somewhere before they seem so real. The key to Koepers books is the time you spend contemplating what you have learned and is it possible to have this really happen to our government and in our country. If you were ever skeptical about politics this book will fuel your skepticism. Enjoy the ride on this emotional roller coaster.
4,Great stories and 19 gorgeous paintings by G. Harvey,"This inspirational and insightful book makes a great gift for fathers. The short stories are broken down into four sections: A Father, A Leader; A Father, A Protector; A Father, A Provider; and A Father, A Spiritual Role model. Some of the authors are Steve Farrar (Standing Tall); Stu Weber (Just Waitin' for You), Jerry B. Jenkins (Of More Value), James Dobson (Manhood at Its Best, You Cannot Outgive God), Thom Hunter (Head of the House)."
4,everything you need to know,"for anyone starting out with brewing their own beer for the first time, this is a great dvd. they walk you through the process step by step with easy to understand instructions. i've been brewing now for almost a year and every batch has been very rewarding and tasty."
2,"Good for a beginner, but not really worth buying","The DVD was fine, but for the same price you can get quite a bit more information for any number of books (""How to Brew"", ""Radical Brewing"", etc.). I'd strongly urge that you pass on this DVD and pick up a solid book for reference instead. Everyone involved in the making of this video is very intelligent about brewing, but isn't nearly as informing as you'd like it to be."
4,it's really good,"good production and lyrics, pretty chill jazzy like, i got it at the radio station i djed at and might buy a copy that's not clean like the one i've got, solid alt-hip-hop"
1,"Numbing amounts of deer hunting, cookie-cutter people","Gosh, I usually love adventure/suspense reads, but this one just couldn't grab my interest. If the author had put half the effort into characterization that he put into describing the act of hunting a deer, it might have been worth something. All the characters were cookie-cutters except for Diana Jackman and she was so screwed up I thought for a while she was the killer (coulda been a nice twist, parts of her behavior seemed very manic depressive to me). By the time Diana confronts the killer, I didn't even care. Also, I thought it was pretty stupid that the killer is targeting evil deer hunters up north in Canada, when we get about 250,000 deer hunters each fall in Michigan-- they'd have made a hell of a lot more logical target. So the killer stalks some rich hunters way north somewhere white and cold. So it's got an Indian, peyote flavor to it. Go back to the 70's if you still think that's neat. Or better yet, save your money."
3,Disappointed,"This book started out fast paced and exhilerating,and I could not put it down. Yet once in the middle, it became cliche and overexaggerated.Why do authors feel they have to expand on theimpossible to keep a reader interested. Once anovel loses it's credibility, it loses my attention. I did continue reading though, but would not reccommend this book to a friend."
2,"Could have, should have",This is the first book I have read by Mr. Sullivan and after this I am not sure if I will read any more. I was rather disappointed with this novel after reading the premise and the excellent reviews that accompanied it. The background characters are in no way developed enough and as they were eliminated from the book I found myself not really caring. Addtionaly the perspective shifts from the present to the main characters past were very awkward and disorienting. In defense of this novel the hunting scenes were described very well and the background information on the Native American beliefs were fascinating-but not enough to carry the book. As a nature guide book-excellent-as a suspense novel-medicore
4,Curious about the feathers changing as the book went along.,"I am curious about the fact that the feather found in Patterson's mouth was a Red Tailed Hawk, but when referenced later in the book it became a raven feather. The feather found in Grover's mouth was an Owl feather, but was later referred to as a raven....did I miss something????? Also, I thought Pawlett was not scalped but when Little Crow got to Ryan's hideout his scalp was there... I loved the book and the story, but am afraid I missed something......"
1,I thought he was dead?,"What the crap is this? I got suckered in to buy this record today by the guy at the bookstore. He told me it was amazing!! Yeah amazing is not the word I am thinking of. The name record is called ""Let It Go"". I agree Paul realize that everyone in the world has let you go.Buy a Sanctus Real record before this soundtrack for boredom.I think my ears are bleeding after listening to this."
4,Overall a good book !!!,"Overall Boy2Girl is a good book. The subject is really unique, which makes the book even better. Another thing that i thought was good was the format. Instead of just writing it in I or just from one character, he writes form each of the characters. Like he'll start talking as the main character then switch to another. I thought that it was really interesting. But i don't think that it was a great book. I think that it was a fun read, but i would get bored ocassionally. But i would rate it a 4 out of 5."
4,The movie -- that's it.,"So glad this excellent film was made available on DVD. I would have like some liner notes or other information included.When you put the DVD into the player, the movie starts; no extras or previews. That is okay... but it would have been niceto have something else..."
3,"Movie is great, features aren't","Was excited to see this final on DVD, but was very disappointed that it doesn't have closed caption. It is widescreen, and quality is good. Also beware that it may not work on all players or PC for playback"
3,A light-hearted comedy romp with a cute Christmas ending.,Fitzwilly is a light-hearted comedy romp that ends with a made for Christmas ending. Dick Van Dyke plays the butler who desperately tries to help his seemimgly out of money employer who is bent on spending money for various causes. To save the heritage is the point and to any end is the answer. A must see near the fireplace.
5,Good Classic Movie,"The movie is very good and I have no complaints about the movie. Dick Van Dyke is awesome as Fitzwilly the butler. My only complaint with this DVD is that there is no menu, and there is no bonus features. I was hoping for at least a trailer to the movie, but there was none on this DVD. Being that this is the only DVD of this movie I could find, I went ahead and purchased it, but not sure if it is worth the price.I still recommend this movie to anyone who likes classic Dick Van Dyke movies."
1,A Poor Version of VB6 Language Reference,"The VB6 Language Reference included all items of interest to VB6 with ""Applies to"" references which was very valuable. This is missing in VB.net reference. Also, procedures and event handlers were included in VB6 reference, but are not in vb.net reference. Compared to the wealth of information about VB6 in the VB6 reference and the lack of information about vb.net in the VB.net reference, I consider it a waste of money. A reference should include all the necessary information on procedures, event handlers, etc., much like a condensed version of what is included in the ""Super Bible"" series of VB books."
3,"Not Bad, Better than some!","Helpful book, had better examples than some ""instructional"" books I have seen! Wouldn't purchase as the first book but is handy to have around."
5,A Great Cookbook!!!!!,"When I checked this book out from the library in Lincoln, NE, I thought that it was going to be like a so,so cookbook. Low and behold Creole Feast is a true New Orleans, Louisiana cookbook. After checking out this book 20 times I decided to buy the book. I wish I had money to buy one for my sister who is studying to be a chef in New Orleans, LA. I am unemployed and need a job badly so all I can afford is one book for now. I cooked the white sauce and added feta cheese it was remarkable. Thank you for letting me share my thoughts.SincerelyKathy A. Lawes-Reedthe singer"
5,The best book ever written,"The best book ever written! Undoubtedly 20x better than Harry Potter, and for those of you who have read the Golden Compass (by Philip Pullman) and thought that was good, wait till you read this! I ended up reading several of these a week. Thomas (author) has an amazing way of leading the reader into the described world, allowing you to ""become"" the main character and, although this book is fantasy, one can become very attached to Merlin/Emrys (main character), his sister and all of the other characters. Wonderful book!"
5,Better then Harry Potter!,"This book was the most exciting book I've ever read. When I guessed what was going to happen next I was always wrong the next thing that happened was always more exciting, creative and excilerating. This book was far more BETTER then Harry Potter!"
4,A thrilling edition to the already legendary myth of Merlin*,"As an avid reader of all Merlin books, I found this book highly enjoyable. Although each version of his tale varies, as with ""Lost Years"", it was fun to think of his life before he became the best known wizard in the world, to imagine how he became so great at the art of magic. Anyone with a taste for magic should read these books."
3,"Good, but not good enough for me to read the rest of them","Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, but it has quite a few problems.The characters are good, but the story was very rushed. At the beginning, it was a nicely flowing story. The evolution of the characters was plausible.Then, once he reached the island, it fell apart.Suddenly, you're thrust into a plot that you know nothing about, facing a bad guy that you found out about only 30 pages before the climax, with a surprise ending that has no power because there wasn't enough time for the plot to evolve and because the surprise is a cliche."
5,The Best BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,There is a wizard and he is trying to find his mother and he is going to a place to find her and he finds him self on a iland i am no telling no more i dont want to ruin this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Painful to read,"I selected this book to read as an independent choice for my Adolescent Literature course in college because I was interested in Arthurian Myth. After reading the introduction, I thought this author had the same passion and knowledge about Arthurian Myth as I did, and I hoped that this book would reflect that. Oh boy, was I wrong! This novel was painfully predictable, the plot seemed absolutely random, and many of the characters and events were so cliche that I laughed at loud. I felt like I was reading a 9th grader's first draft of a novel. I'll never read this author's work again."
2,"Lacking in depth, detail, and development","I read The Lost Years of Merlin twice, once in an evening to follow the story, and the second time out loud to my son, over a period of many weeks. When read quickly the lack of development and detail gets brushed away by the addled pace. There are a few good concepts, though they are diluted by digressions and contrivinces, and the plot moves along quickly.However, when read slowly these problems dominated the narrative and left me frustrated and bored. My 6 year old son, who loves to draw pictures to illustrate the stories that he hears, was unable to find inspiration. That a visually precocious child could gain no mental picture of a crucial plot element, the shrouded castle, says it all."
5,This book leads a world of adventure!,"This bookwas the best book I have ever read. It was so hard to stop reading. I definitly, and highly recomend this book!"
3,enchanting but not original,"This book was great. The one major flaw was that much of the plot(the treasures, rusted plains,ect) copied The Books of Prydian by Lloyd Alexander.Even so Fincayra was enchanting and captivating."
5,incredable,i think T.A. barron does an incredable job in creating the lost years of merlin if your a fantasy fan this is a must read
4,Its ok,This book isnt the best iv read but its preatty goodI mean its about Merlins childhood and no one really knows about it.Just so anyone knows i didnt read any of the sequels
1,Overrated,"Book seems to stick to a formula. The suspense seemed artificial and instead of a vicarious fantasy (which I expected), it felt like a documentary. Pick up Harry Potter instead."
2,once again the,"trozei!!!TROZEI!!!TROZBUD!!!trozei!!!once thought to be a reckless cooking machine, the one and only.Though it is still the force field (only this can be the answer)So I bought it, and I cant do anything else besides eat takos. If not for taco bell I would die. crunch rap supreme is supreme. dont go for the prize, your life depends on all those who. name one two three. do it again. Some nascarr racers once attended an after party before a race. the result? //;/;pigs sometimes go to the bank to get their quarterback. (thats my favorite joke. HaHa) Lets go to their. everywhere. but dont give in. the scientists are going to be gone in a few days, so we can then steal their data and sell it. so you think you the only one your right, but its all right. so and if now by.WE AND FROM TEO MORCH.>>>> >>>> (*hds) (*&din; o)"
4,Good to play while you wait,"I like this game, even though the kids don't. It is kinda like Tetris, and I could play it for quite a while, but the kids think it is boring."
4,Trozei,"Great service. Arrived in great shape and in great time.I haven't played the game yet. It's a present for my grandson. He's played it, loved it and wanted it for Christmas so I assume 4 stars are a good rating. He's 10."
1,Not impressed,"This is our first experience with handheld games. The Nintendo DS Lite is fabulous; the Pokemon Trozei is not. My son is 6 1/2 years old. He quickly mastered the game (getting 4 pokemons in a row) and became quite bored. While I was looking for an ""easy"" game for beginners, this one was too easy...too much money for such a simple game."
4,Sounds Cool...,"I read other veiws and it sounded really cool. You need to line up at least 4 pokemon unless you have a ditto along with the others. Ditto counts as any pokemon you throw in. The boss battles challenging, it's easy to master, and it sound like a really cool game."
2,Whats the ponit of this game.,After playing this in the store I don't get it. You move the heads around untill you have matched four of a pokemons head in a row? I wated about 5 minuits of my life playing this game and I did not enjoy it. Ever since pokemon dash these games are going down the market kids now like Sonic and Mario and are big sellers. Don't buy unlees you want a pointless game.
4,Pokemon Trozei,"I picked this up on a whim, I originally had no intent of getting it until the price went down quite a bit. However it was pretty fun when I first got it. Once you get the hang of it, it's not a bad game. There's no shooting people or bombing enemy armies, but it's fun all the same, in a different way.However, while I have fun trying to get those last few Pokemon for my Trozei list, it was more fun before I beat the game, TWICE. Once you beat it once,it's quite simple to beat it again. It's a good puzzle game, although it takes some strategy and perseverance to beat a few bosses.For people who jump at the chance to buy any Pokemon game that comes out on the market, be warned, this is not your average game. You don't catch or train Pokemon, you don't adventure all over whatever region the game is set in, you don't encounter trainers who want to prove how strong their Pokemon are, and you don't challenge gym leaders for badges."
5,Pokemon version of Bejeweled,"Fun game, just a Pokemon version of Bejeweled. So if you like Pokemon and like Bejeweled, perfect combination then. Fun game too as well."
2,pure what ?,"in the 80's numan was a trend setter, he paved the way to electronica to become what it is today.after ""pleasure principal"" and ""telekon"", numan gave birth to ""dance"" and "" i assasin"" they were different, guttsy and experiemntal. i keep waiting for that ""different"" from numan but so far his last 4,5 cd's sound very similar. ""pure"" is like ""exile"" with distorted guitars, weird(er) lyrics , and a style very reminiscent to that of nine inch nails (and similar bands...)it's time for numan to come out of his dark state ,cause its getting old. i guess the only thing left for me to do is pray (to the aliens !)"
1,A pure disaster,The tracks here are horrible NIN/Smashing Pumpkins rip off songs . This is without a shadow of a doubt humiliating to listen to . Trying to be hip with todays kids is just not working . Of course if you are a big fan of Numan you will love this . If you are a goth - you might like this but in the end you can't help but complain and the substandard lyrics ( they're worse than NIN's for god sake ( and that takes a bit of beating ))However if my prejudices anger you - I'm sorry . It's just that this album to me sounded appalling . By all means if you are intending to buy it - fair enough - but if you hate it - don't say I didn't warn you
3,"A dark, sinister wall of sound","He's always been out there lurking... waiting for the chance to break into the mainstream again, to be remembered in America for something more than ""Cars"". Contrary to popular belief in the U.S., Gary Numan never went away at all. After his new wave smash hit of 1979, he kept on innovating and changing and producing albums. Some of these were spectacular (1988's ""New Anger"" is my favorite) and some were awful. With Pure, Numan has gone industrial, or rather, returned to industrial, because his early synth music is sighted by many artists like Trent Reznor as a major inspiration for this slashing, dark, atonal genre. ""Pure"" is a dark, sinister wall of sound that finds Numan trapped in its core wailing about all that is horrible. I think this is probably a very good album. It's just that I am not a fan of industrial music. If you are into Alice in Chains and bands like that, you should check out one of the founding fathers at his tortured best."
4,Strong and Very Dark Album By Gary Numan,"If you look at the cover, Gary Numan is dressed like Neo from ""The Matrix"" and is doing the Jesus Christ Pose against a darkened sky. If this does not give you a little clue about what to expect, then you must be without a clue. Fans of gothic/industrial music are going to love this album. The songs are very well written and very doomy and gloomy. Numan is obviously influenced by Nine Inch Nails here but he is not simply ripping off Trent Reznor. He just takes a few pointers from Trent and creates music of his own. My favorite tracks are:PureRibOne Perfect LieMy JesusListen To My VoiceThis album would be great for listening during that drive to attend Goth Night at your favorite club on a rainy night."
4,really great cd...,"This isn't usually my style of music, but I must say that it is really good. I have listened to it a few times now. dark, moody, and well written are all words to describe this CD (I need to thank my wife for putting it in my wish list, because I would have never heard of him otherwise)"
2,Phil Collins Singles Collection,"The review of the Phil Collins Singles Collection Video did provide any of the names of the songs on it. Could you please E-mail me back to let me know if the song ""Do you remember"" is on it? Thank you very much in advan. Cheryl LaForme"
1,Hartz Products Can Be Dangerous,"Before you put this on your pet, you may want to search Google for ""hartz flea shampoo for cats"", or go to the website hartzvictims dot org. There are a lot of sad stories about animals that have died from this stuff. Before you coat your animal in chemicals, be sure to do a thorough background search on the product. Your pets life depends on it."
2,OK but not great. lousy spring,"I cut some rosemary and thyme and basil from plants outside. The woody stems beat up on the scissors blades. The blades sharpened quickly though. These two things lead me to believe that they're not as strong an alloy as advertised.The spring mechanism is failure. It's not a spring, but a metal strip that you have to rebend to be ""assisted"" by the ""spring assisted"" shears.It does not fully open the blades for you.for the money, they're OK. I like most Zyliss products I have used. If I had to do over again, I'd buy theKuhn Rikon Ultimate Snips 8.5-inchsnips. Those look like they will cut herb bushes.PS-If you want scissors, get some full steel scissors."
3,Not Zyliss Quality,"I've had these scissors for about 3 months now and it works fine with most things, but it can't cut through plastic packaging (bags of food, milk, etc.) I was much better of with my generic kitchen scissors that I have before. I do have to admit though that it looks very attractive hanging in the kitchen."
1,Would not recommend,"Dry, redundant, full of typos and looks unfinished. The author did not bother proofreading, as he left things like, ""blah, blah, blah is similar to what was mentioned in ."" The examples were boring and unhelpful. This was a recommended book for my graduate level consulting class, but I would not recommend this book to anyone who wishes to expand their knowledge. As another reviewer mentioned, this book is way overpriced...I wish I could get my money back."
2,Psychological Consultation and Collaboration in School and Community Settings- Michael Dougherty,"Dry boring and simplistic this is not an exciting topic and this book has no business being $120.This book is unremarkable, Most of the chapters just contain stages and phases BORING"
2,Not very useful for the class,"I took a class on consultation and collaboration at the graduate level for School Psychology. I found the text to be very redundant, and the case studies to be quite dry."
1,Dont Recommend if Not Required,"If this book wasn't required for one of my courses I would definitely NOT recommend it. The chapters are not broken up into sections well and everything runs together into one long paragraph. The case studies are a bit helpful, but its hard to get any guidance when all the author does is put the problem out there, and not offer a possible solution or what he would have done. That would have been more useful by far. If you are serious about learning the theoretical background behind consultation, then this may be the book for you. It was definitely not the one for me."
1,Horrible customer service,"Knew within hour of placing order that it was the wrong edition - took 3 days to get response and another 3 days to respond again with return instructions. Also, paid extra for expedited service due to estimated ship date. Ending up shipping 3 days before ship date and express payment was unnecessary. Will not buy from again."
5,BLURAY TOP QUALITY.,"Superb Quality on Bluray in its original 1.85 WideScreen format.Dirk Bogarde in a good role,before he became a serious actor.Highly Recommended."
3,Its ok,"Wasn't too crazy about it, but for a crappy winter day when nothing else was going on and nothing good on TV it was ok. As long as you don't pay full price, its worth the read."
3,What's milder than vanilla?,"This was the fluffiest most vanilla romance novel I have ever read. There is not much here but enough to paint a pretty and Very Mild picture. I would imagine that even most contemporary fiction that is described as ""young adult"" is more intense than this. For my tastes, it's not really even three stars worthy. But, IF you're looking for sweet and benign, then you might like this."
3,"I like Lori Foster's men, but som her women are idiots.","I suspect she has made a pretty common character development mistake and written stubbornness when she means strength. The problem is that strong women, especially those over 25, have learned the difference the hard way- you know the saying about that which cannot bend breaking?So this book was shallow but entertaining right up until the end. Then suddenly Honey pulls a dumbass move motivated by sheer ignorance, and rather than saying ""wow, that was a dumbass move!"" everyone was amazed by her bravery. Bravery never requires needlessly running into danger. I told my son when he caught me laughing out loud that it was akin to someone jumping into quicksand rather than going around it, and everyone clapping and praising the move.Stubbornness is not strength. Neither is refusing to avoid danger just to be obstinate!"
4,"Tangerine Dream - 'Live In Montreal,Canada' (Boot Moon) 4 1/2 stars","Very good 2-CD/2 hour live performance from the German kings of synthesizer progressive rock, Tangerine Dream. Show took place on April 9, 1977. Total of nine semi-mind altering tracks for your pure listening pleasure here. Personally, cuts here I dug the absolute most were the 24-minute ""Thrid Movement"", a bit of krautrock madness-the 20-minute ""Fourth Movement"" and the rather sedate ""Bonus Track 3"". Very enjoyable. 'Live In Montreal' is from a series of live vintage Tangerine Dream recordings that officially compete with the much-circulated band's bootlegged shows. After just one listen, you'll fully understand WHY fans are willing to take time to hunt down such albums. Recommended."
3,Great Bargin!,Friendly to use organizer good for a student or the serious buisnessman. At its price it's a must have!
1,Buy something else,"I got a Royal Vista for Xmas, returned it the next day. The unit shipped with four dead batteries. With fresh new batteries, the display was still dim even on the highest contrast setting, except when the serial port was plugged in and Vista Sync was running on my PC -- then it was OK or maybe needed the contrast turned down a bit. I could not get the unit to transfer data to or from either of my PC's. Both the unit and the PC said the data transferred successfully, but in fact, nothing transferred. In addition, the PIM that comes with it (""Royal Link"") did not match the Vista's features very well -- field lengths were different, etc. The inability to successfully transfer data to/from my PC was the thing that convinced me to return the unit. I tried -- I did everything the help files on the CDROM and their web site said; then I called their long distance support number and waited an hour without speaking to a human before I gave up."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I bought this and returned it the next day. It is difficult to use, and it refused to power up 3 times in the single day I owned it! I had to reset it in order to get it to power up. The keyboard is cumbersome, and disconnects too easily. I returned it, and purchased a Casio PV400-Plus instead, and I have been very pleased."
3,nice idea but poor execution,"I had many of the same problems as the other reviewers. I did not give up and after several days was able to work around the problems, except the back space key thing! I am sure that most readers would not be willing to persevere. But if you do you may be like me and fall in love with this organizer. It is small with a lot of features and memory for the price. It is perfect for me. Who knows, if you're lucky you may get one that actually works right out of the box!"
1,Bad Vista,"I got one for Xmas and it broke 3 months later. the screen cracked, keyboard stopped fuctioning. I opened it up and found it was poor;y assembled. the screen was not reenforced. The biggest piece of junk ever!"
3,Good for the price,"I bought this little PDA for my husband so that he would have an easily replaced PDA incase of loss or damage as he works around heavy machines that have eaten up pagers and other items before. He loves it as it is small enough to fit in his wallet but he can attach the keyboard to add information as required. He has had nothing but good to say about this PDA. Those of you who want the high dollar toys don't buy this one, BUT if you want a PDA for your phone numbers, appointments and with the ability to download to your home or office PC this is an low cost great buy."
4,Very Good Show... BUT,"Very good performance by this excellent group. The audio quailty is good. However, The video quality is bad!"
2,Neil Young - Upbeat?,"Steve Martin once said that banjo music cannot be anything but happy. That being said, the ""Pickin' on Neil Young"" collection just doesn't work. If anyone thinks ""Needle and the Damage Done"" can be anything but a sad commentary, well, that alone should give you an idea as to why this album isn't even a close miss."
2,Very Disappointing,"I am a therapist and frequently talk with clients about how the brain works on a very basic level, particularly thinking and feeling. I wanted a simple, non-overwhelming model to be able to show clients during this explanation. I was so excited for my brain to arrive but was extremely disappointed with the actual thing. Most disappointing was that it didn't have the amygdala or hippocampus listed among the parts. Also disappointing was that the two halves don't stay together unless you hold them. The outside is gray rather than the bright yellow shown in the image, and it's made of material reminiscent of a dog-toy. I believe this would be good for children which is why there are so many positive comments about it, but if you want it for anything other than that, keep looking. As one other reviewer said (which I should have heeded and didn't), ""it's neither a toy nor an educational tool"". I certainly expected to get a lot more for the price."
1,"Over-priced, over-simplified, poorly made foam garbage","I can't believe anyone would pay the price amazon is charging for this piece of junk and be happy. It's two pieces of foam with paint and stickers on it. I have a 7 year old who LOVES Science and is very bright and this is going to BORE her, yet 7+ is the recommended age. This is ridiculously over-simplified, over-priced, and NOT well-made at all. NOT happy, would NOT recommend."
3,fairly ordinary,it has become a dog toy. The model was just too simplistic. More detail required. wouldn't recommend it. Not sure who it would be useful for
2,Not useful,Once again I teach AP psychology and was looking for affordable brain models. Thought this model would be useful but it is not. Not much I can do with this. It lacks detail and the 2 halves dos not stay together
5,Great educational tool for elementary school,"I used this as part of my Brain Awareness Week activities for my second graders. I love how it is color coded, shows the parts of the brain, and is durable! It feels like a nerf football...which is what you want in an elementary class. I wish there was a way to make the two sides stick together, but that is minimal. Fortunately the outside of the brain is grey and not the yellow pictured. Excellent!"
3,Neuroscience,"This product is good, but it isn't detailed. If you are looking for a detailed brain to help with studying I would look for a different one. This one helped, but only has the large parts of the brain labeled and shown. There are very few parts that are depicted. Although this would be good for children starting to learn about the brain."
5,Arizing's Amazing new EP.,I own this Album and I have to say that it's amazing. I really loved the album and could listen to it over and over and over and over.... I strongly recommend that you buy this.
5,Very good promo CD!,"I went to a concert of their's the other night. Since I do know the band personally, the lead singer asked me how much to sell it for. I said 5 dollars. I got at it the concert for exactly that much. This CD is a very good investment into Arizing. I seriously recomend this to anyone who liked Womb. Nice job!"
2,Blech,"well maybe we got a bad batch but YUCKO. Im all about natural and organic and am even aware that some of the good for you food well, will have a different taste. This is just horrible. I ha dto take them away from my son as I was worried. The company should look into quality control. I seriously think they just a gross bacth but what does that say for the company???"
1,"Immaculate Baking Company Cookies, Sweet Georgia Brownie","DRY, NOT VERY FLAVORFUL, NOT AS 'CHOCOLATEY' AS A BROWNIE SHOULD BE. I ENDED UP GIVING THEM TO OUR NEIGHBORS. YUK!"
5,"Works, smells mildly nice","This is my favorite toilet cleaner. We don't let our toilets get filthy, so I can't speak to how well it would work if you put it to a difficult test. But it has a pleasant minty smell that's not overwhelming or obnoxious in a bathroom, and I'm happy that it's less dangerous to have around. It won't bleach holes in my jeans if it splashes and isn't quite as toxic to kids and pets as most commercial toilet elixirs, though it's still not good for anyone to sip, no matter how nice it smells, so don't."
5,Works like it should,I used this to install a new stereo into my 1994 Toyota camry. It worked perfectly and everything fit like it should.
2,Popsicle Stick Handle,"After reading how useful the silicone spatulas and spoon were I looked forward to trying them out.I was very disappointed with the cheap, thin wooden handles. Appearantly no time was spent on the ergonomic design of how you grasp and use the silicone heads."
1,Topical but badly done,"I hate to fast-forward when I'm watching a DVD, but this was one of those movies. Slow, boring, unlikeable characters, depressing. This is a concept that should have been developed into a richer and more elaborate film that would actually be interesting to watch."
1,what a d*ckw*d husband!!!,Movie was intense for a while but I wanted to beat the cr*p out of the husband who wouldn't let his wife in. What a f-in loser!!!.....geeez. Leave your wife outside cuzz yer scared???.... anyhow...
1,Completely Off,"I watched this video expecting to see something similar to what was mentioned in the blurb on the case. In reality, the story was pretty much the opposite. The characters were not sympathetic and the drama was a little overdone.I would have had a better review had the movie actually been what was on the box. The ending was cheap and contrived. You're expecting some awesome event only to find, naturally, the military is our enemy. Now, is that a new and original twist?I would recommend that you watch at your own risk."
1,Movie's great... service sucks,"I netflix'd this movie, and loved it. So, I logged onto Amazon and ordered it on 2/5/08. It was scheduled to be delivered by 2/11/08. I have yet to receive the movie, and it is now 2/25/08. When I checked to status of the delivery, it said it had been returned. There was no way for me to contact the seller. I called my local USPS office, and they said it was returned undeliverable. We checked and verified the shipping address (and it was correct), they said I would have to take it up with amazon. HOWEVER, I have searched this page and cannot find a way to contact ANYONE concerning this product or my order."
3,claustrophobic panic,"It's a kind of post 9/11 terrorist/disaster thing involving a series of dirty bombs set off in Los Angeles and the ensuing toxic fallout from them. The view is constricted to the claustrophobic panic of what one man sees and hears, so the viewer is left in the dark about a lot of things. It's a low-budget, independent type of film, but I was quite riveted by it nonetheless. Well, mostly. While I was dutifully chilled to the bone by the images, predicaments and consequences presented in the film, there were some things that didn't quite jell for me. Still, I give it thumbs up for scaring the bejesus outta me and turning my skin as cold as stone, like all good apocalyptic type stories do."
1,All dressed up and no place to go,"We don't care about these characters because the development is zero. When you finally do reach the ""twist"" you are so bored that you couldn't care less what happens to this couple. The film attempts to create these loving, sympathizing characters during extreme circumstances but fails miserably. Perhaps it is the use of over-the-top foul language that prevents the viewer from really wanting to feel for these people. I'm no prude and actually see how harsh language is sometimes realistic and adds to the drama but hearing people screaming, ""f*#k this"" and ""fu*king that"" 5-6 times in one minute is just ridiculous. Bring some knitting or your checkbook to balance because there is plenty of time for it. When the twist (FINALLY) comes I guess we're supposed to get all, ""Woe! That is so freaky!"" but I was left hearing Peggy Lee singing, ""Is that All There Is?"""
4,Efffective little thriller,"This low-budget indie affair is nonetheless effective in a ""what would YOU do?"" way. When L.A. is hit by a series of explosions that turn out to be poison bombs, the repurcussions focus on a young couple who've just moved into a new home. The wife has left work while the husband is home, waiting for the cable man, when the explosions occur. With only a radio to provide news information, the tension grows as the husband struggles to find and help his wife, who'd been headed to an area where on the explosions took place. Mary McCormack and Rory Cochrane as the young couple do excellent work, bringing raw emotion to a situation that seems nothing short of hopeless.It's not glossy, not laden with special effects, but a character study of a loving couple facing a crisis of unknown proprotion."
2,operators are busy...,"apart from a shockeroo didn't-see-that-coming ending and a deft,touching, lyrical, even poetic scene of contaminated dust and debris wafting into the protagonists' backyard, this film schemes to make the most out of an obviously low budget. we hear about the bombs and their aftermath all from radio broadcasts-- no faux tv anchors here. and it seems that way too much time is wasted in the first quarter with Mr. Unemployed Musician fiddling and fumbling with what seems are more cellphones than one can find at RadioShack hoping to reach his wife. yes, this flick is claustrophobic and dark and even menacing(and boring every time mom gets on the phone-- we hear, not see her) so when the Big One Hits, make sure you have plenty of duct tape to swaddle/cocoon/barricade yourselves in your home or apartment. also, load up on bottled water."
3,Horrific Tale of Urban Terrorism,"Multiple dirty bombs detonate in and around Los Angeles. Protagonist Brad is a stay at home husband who lives within sight of downtown L.A. He wife, Lexi, goes to work downtown as normal, but there is nothing normal about this day.As toxic residue blankets the area, Brad finds himself in a classic lifeboat situation. Whom to save and whom to jettison? Where do you draw the line between helping others and putting yourself in jeopardy. An end of film twist raises questions of who is the rescuer and who is the rescued.A disturbing film and a vision one hopes remains confined to cinema. Other eras had Godzilla and other monsters spawned from atomic fallout. Today's horrors pose against the all-too-real backdrop of 9/11. ""Right at Your Door"" may give you bad dreams but is 98 minutes of escapism."
4,Good Read,"I walked into a christian bookstore to find a title that could inspire my ex-boyfriend. He had been through a lot in his childhood and many of those things have seeped into how he reacts to things as an adult. I then picked up Johnson's book and went home to read it, before sending it off to my ex. I read it straight through in one day; it gets hard to put down once you have started it. Johnson tells his life story in a moving and conversational way; I mostly enjoyed his analysis of his childhood as he described the events. It does seem like, towards the end, that Johnson either ran out of time or energy to really conclude the book, though.Never the less, I think that it is a good book to add to any book club's reading list, possibly as a spark to discuss issues regarding the plight of the black man."
5,Excellent Study Resource!,"I just got through taking my Property I final and I can tell you from experience that this book was *very* helpful in preparing me! The exams are challenging and realistic. Also, in the answer key, it doesn't just tell you what the right answer is, but it tells you why it's right and why the other answers are wrong. Another thing I liked about it is that it has the subject matters broken down in the index by question numbers. After taking the exams, I was able to quickly determine where my strong areas were and where I needed to study more. I highly recommend this book for all 1Ls!"
2,"Good idea, but leaves too much out","As a fan of Lois Rock's Learning About...series, all of which have reviewed, I was disappointed by this offering from her. In an effort to be short, Lois has left out some details of some of the stories which in my opinion were important in the idea of the story. Many of the most popular stories are included, and while this was a good idea I feel this was not given as much effort as could have been given. I feel this could have been improved by possibly making it two books, one dealing with each section of the Bible, instead of shortening the stories so much as to leave it lacking in details. I also felt the writing was somewhat confusing for younger children that possibly had little knowledge of the Bible previously. Pictures were nice, but in some places the type over the pictures was hard to read because of the color beneath the type. I feel this is worth reading, but with additional discussion offered by the person reading the story."
2,Not good for stain removal or brightening whites,"I love eco-friendly products. And I have nothing against biokleen (their automatic dishwashing detergent works better than anything in my Bosch). But their powdered laundry detergent is a huge disappointment. I use this in my high-efficiency front-loader, and clothes come out dingy and stained. I've tried different amounts of this detergent and different cycles but can't seem to get it to work for my household. The nearly full box is literally sitting on the shelf because I have to pretreat all of the stains with Tide before I can use it! This product just doesn't work as well as it should. I'd be real careful about buying this in bulk if you're a first-time user."
4,"Atmospheric, Thoughtful and Stirring","I completely agree with the views of the reviewer who preceded me here. This excellent rerecording of the John Williams' score to Midway doesn't lack for bite and energy -- it's a magnificent performance from start to finish. One tends to want to play the Midway March over and over, of course, and linger on the Men of the Yorktown March, but the rest of the music is engaging as well, and one very nice aspect to the score is that, though the tracks are very short -- one to two minutes each -- they all transition from one to the next wonderfully, so that they form a continuous flowing suite lasting more than half an hour. Highly recommended."
2,cute but not functional,"I bought this Nemo backpack for my granddaughter for preschool this fall. It is totally adorable and almost totally nonfunctional for its intended purpose. The pocket of the backpack MIGHT hold an apple or an orange. The zipper is located at the mouth and is 5"" long, if that. I could barely fit my hand through the opening.Nevertheless, my granddaughter loves it and wears it everywhere (to restaurants, to swim lessons). I intend to put in a longer zipper and make a pocket big enough to hold preschool needs so she can use it for its intended purpose. I wish the manufacturer's review would have stated that this does not have an inner pocket large enough to be of use."
4,Lovely but Strange,"Very well documented book on this subject. While personally I know little about it, Julian Cope has obviously invested some time and energy into this lovely book."
5,A wonderful history of a fascinating place,"History changed in Montgomery, Alabama...from the birth of the modern Civil Rights movement to the great country music of Hank Williams. The social forces in this small Southern city impacted the way we live. Wayne Greenhaw has done a stellar job of painting that history with a graceful and easy style. Read and enjoy!"
2,Great product after you fix it,"I put the headband on one time and one of the Velcro tabs came off. After, I re-attached the tab it was just fine. Mitt is nice and soft."
4,This thing is kinda amazing...but can be hard to clean.,"I mostly use the mitt and I must say that it wipes away what my pricey cleansers seem to leave behind. Its a must in summer when I'm feeling especially hot and gritty and really want to ""feel"" clean. I barely need to use a cleanser - just wet the mitt and wipe and tadah (no dry skin, no itchiness)! However, for all its great work at getting my face clean, it is difficult to get/keep clean. It always looks ""stained"" even if I bleach and soak it. I haven't used the headband myself - I've used on my daughter to keep her hair from getting wet while she ""swims"" in the tub....works well. Smile!"
4,Pixel Chix,Great product. Easy to comprehend and is entertaining. It's fun to have more than one Pixel too so they can interact - however it's not necessary.
5,My daughter loves it!,I bought this and the pet shop/salon and my girls put them together and play all the time.
3,Okay for the price,"My 5 yr old daughter has been asking me for this toy for at least the last couple of years. But I couldn't justify paying $35 for a toy I wasn't sure she would understand or be able to work. Seeing the sale price of $10 online with Amazon during the holidays I didn't think twice about clicking it into my shopping cart and whipping out my credit card. This was the perfect price to let my daughter try out what she wanted without busting my wallet. She has enjoyed it but not as much as I think she thought she would.Very glad I didn't invest as much as the retail price on this toy. Fun but not for $35, especially when you think of the other Pixel Chick games you can get to connect to it. By the time you buy them all to connect to each other I wonder why they don't make it into a game on the Nintendo Advance or DS. You would spend just as much on the system and a game and have a much smaller toy to pack around."
3,PIxel Chix greate toy for a few days,"The toy came. But, the batteries gave out in one day. I think this was a good buy. But, I did have to install new batteries, probably because it's been on the shelf for a while. However, as with all toys that I get my daughter she really enjoyed this for a few days. I found the way the way the toy worked to be very interesting. But, as with everything she want's a nintendo ds now."
1,Toy didn't work,I gave this as a gift and the mother called an wanted to know where I got it because after only one day it didn't work any more and she wanted to return it. She also said her daughter lost interest in the toy pretty quickly. This is second hand information so others who have bought this toy may have had a more positive experience.
2,Very Upset...,"I bought this toy at Target yesterday and when I brought it home it was broken! We think the little slip you take out for Try Me Mode is still stuck in there! Every time I push the buttons they do NOT do what the directions say they are supposed to. She usually says, ""Can I get a large cheese?"" Then the guy delivers her pizza, she eats it, and immediately the game shuts itself off. I am having problems with the screen also. It keeps darkening. I can hardly even see it anymore! Be wise and don't buy this toy. I have one of the houses also that I bought at Walmart. She works perfectly fine though. Well, good luck if you choose to buy this!"
1,"""Very Boring -Mom"" Is what my daughter said after awhile...","She was so happy to get this and then after a while, she said it was boring. Then 2 weeks later the screen has lines in it. Changed batteries and it still does it. So I found it under the couch one day. Needless to say it was confusing to play and connecting one to another was a joke! Don't waste your money!"
4,Pixel Chix product review,"My Granddaughter is 9 yrs old--She had the first ""Home"" Pixel Chix. She played with it so much and took it everywhere, I decided to get her another one for Christmas. We had trouble with the screen going blank or half of the scene would get lines through it. We changed the batteries, thinking they were losing charge. But it still did the same thing. Then I noticed there is a reset hole near the battery door. I tried it and it worked. So now when it goes haywire we just push the reset and it works really well. I think the reset button should be put into the instructions.This is a great product, looking forward for more pieces to follow. I am going to get her the car for her birthday in May."
4,Useful for P/E prep and general reference,"This book is pretty useful for p/e prep and as a general reference manual. I think it's very difficult to cover everything that could appear on the p/e exam and thus there are lots of things that do appear on the exam that are omitted here but it's still very useful. Don't assume that if you got through this book you've covered everything on the exam, there are things that are missing. For general reference you're probably better off with a specific book on each subject - i.e. a concrete, steel and timber book. Overall though I found that using this book as an overall guide for p/e prep was very helpful."
3,SE Exam Review Book,Note that this book cannot be used when taking the Structural Engineering exam in Illinois.
3,"Good Book, but not for the Test","When I found this book online I thought,""Great, a concise study guide to the Structural I PE"". When I got to the test every person in the room had a copy of the same book. During the test I used it about three times. Needless to say I had spent almost my entire study time combing through the reference manual thinking that I was getting ""prepared"". A word of wisdom; the pass rate on the Structural I in Colorado last fall was 30%. Do you think the test makers would make it that easy so that you could buy a book with all the problems right off Amazon? The good news is that this book has been a really good reference for work back at the office. So in short, a good book for minor reference work, but I wouldn't walk into the test again thinking this book was my bread and butter."
1,Very Deep!,Heavy! For sure. Recieved it the edges where broken. Michael just go PDF like your Marketing Department Says! I'm ready my email is globalshipping-corporation@earthlink.net special delivery and hear it is. Instant delivery!!! But I have no more comments about that!
4,Bigelow perfect peach herb tea,"I found the quality very good. We drink a lot of Iced tea and we are trying different flavors to determine which we like best.Bigelow Perfect Peach Iced Tea, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
3,Read the book as a general advice.,"Well,If you hope this book will teach you how to calculate,no it isn't.There are many views that rate the book higher but I think the book is not worth for your money.Ok,calculation is important in chess.Imagine you can calculate 10 or 15 moves ahead in a position.Sure that's a pride....But in the book, you will not be coach how to do it.Instead,the author will tell a different story:that is what calculation is.Myself,still looking for a good book on HOW to calculate.Finally,don't buy this book.[If you want to find books on how to calculate]I gave 3 stars because there are a few positions and advices that is good."
3,Does Not Live Up to The Hype,"I started reading this book right after reading Silman's ""Reassess Chess"" Book. I was let down and felt that the book somehow got stuck on calculation and left it up to you to figure out how to do it. Calculation abilities vary greatly, even among GM's. It seems that instinct is used more often in deeper positions than calculation. Not a horrible book, but for some reason, it didn't get me excited with some new revelation in my amateur mind."
5,Great book.,"Until you reach the 1900 to 2000 level the only thing that you should be studying is tactics and calculation. The reason for this is simple, if you can see 90% of the combinations on the board during a game, you will not have to even use postional advantages. Don't get me wrong positional play has a very important role, but more at the higher levels. If you can calculate efficiently and quickly you will have a huge advantage over all those people who just memorize opening moves, because after move 10 they're lost. Why are some children so strong at chess? It's because they can calculate well and can visualize the board. The bottom line is get this book along with a set of practice problems, like Reinfeld's 1001. Solve the problems, write down all your candidate moves and analysis, and you'll be amazed by how quickly you improve."
5,Thank you Mr. Stryjniak,"Thank you Mr. Stryniak for your inspired work. I was completely caught up in the music on this CD no matter where I listened to it. It seemed as though you have not only captured the amazing technical aspects of playing Liszt, but there is an emotional foundation that brings life and heart to the notes that are played so well. So, it's not just technically brilliant, but also brought me to tears. Your music touches the soul as well as the intellect. Thank you."
1,Wal-Mart will not honor 15 year limited warranty.,Rake lasted 1 year before it broke.Took it back to Wal-Mart and they only honor it for 90 days.Told me to contact AMES. Once I find a number hopefully they will honor this warranty?
3,"OK, but not too creative","I was expecting some more creativity. Ms. Moyes delivers with instructions on lots of basic pocket styles, but I was hoping for some exotic couture stuff. She gives directions on how to make a difficult curved welt pocket, which I've seen in couture, and shaped facings covering a pocket. If you're looking for a gallery with a lot of neat-o ideas: it's not in this book. Otherwise, it gives straightforward advice on straightforward pockets."
4,This is a great resource guide to learning about pockets :),"This a good book, I always had problems with sewing pockets to my garments. It has good pictures to show you how to place pockets on your garments. It helps you express your creativity with your garments. You can make all kinds of pockets. I use this book whenever I want to do something different with my garments. Very Good book indeed."
3,not quite what I had hoped for,"I had hoped this would give me more specifics and possible a pattern or so. While it's an OK book, I have lots of patterns for pockets from misc sewing patterns I own. I know what they are. I had hoped this book would teach me something new but it didn't. Nice book but not for me."
1,"Great show, but DVD's look like pirated copies - very bad quality","Not reviewing the show, but the DVD quality was the worst I have ever seen! The sound made a humming noise that sounded like my garage door was opening. The video was pretty poor but figured it had to with the age of the show, until we saw the red suit, or anything in red. If the video has any image that is red it is completly pixelated. I think this double set is a pirated copy! I've heard the other box set doesn't have this issue. Heck when I opened these boxes, the discs were in paper sleaves in a rip open box."
1,DVDs were faulty,"I received this ""value pack"" to find that the first DVD of season one and the first DVD of season two did not work correctly. The second DVD of season one seemed OK and I didn't try any others in season two, as I returned the set for a refund. I am not sure if this was a defect only in the set I received, but I did not feel like chancing an exchange it. What I mean by not working correctly is that both of the problem DVDs made horrible noises (almost like they were somehow making contact with the player) that were not coming from speakers. The second season first DVD also would not play at all at first. When I put it back in, it tried to play, but the ""warning"" screen was jumpy and did not consistently display a picture as well as continuing to make the horrible grating noise."
1,Don't Use This! Made my husband's hands numb!,"My husband started taking this to improve his sperm quality. After a week, he began getting numbness & tingling in his hands. We asked our doctor who said that Fertailaid for Men has been known to cause that due to the high levels of one of the B vitamins, and recommended he stop taking it right away since the numbness can get progressively worse, and in some cases is permanent.I don't think they should even be allowed to sell this stuff."
1,This product has not increase my sperm count,Have not finished a full supply of the Product Hoping for a different result Will do a retest after 90 days
4,Fast delivery,This product came to our home very quickly. It has had no harmful side effects for my husband and he does not mind taking them three times a day with meals.We are just taking them for a daily vitamin for him while conceiving. His sperm analysis came back normal! Thank God!
3,Don't irritate his stomach this time around...,"The product arrived on time and in good condition. My husband tried taking these same pills last year, but they irritated his stomach and stopped taking them. Our mini IVF cycle failed due to weak sperm shape and count. Doctor suggested he try them again to help improve his sperm quality, shape and count. He has been taking them now for several weeks and is doing fine. They do not irritate his stomach this time around. I ordered the 3 month supply. We do not know if they are working yet. He has to re-test in 3 months. I will re-post if we have good news (+) sooner."
4,Less bulk,"I've tried to use several different covers for my razor phone, as it gets unbelievably scuffed and dirty just floating around in my purse. Most of the ones I've tried have been really bulky, which kind of takes aways from the whole Razr thing (it's supposed to be skinny dammit!) but this one adds less bulkiness than the others that I've tried and I can make my black razr have more pizzaz by adding some color to it. I don't know what the anti-dust thing is, but as for protecting the razr it works like a charm!"
4,Just as described,"Having read the previous reviews for this item, I knew when I ordered that I might have to play around with the cover a bit to get it to work. When the order came, I was pleased to find my LCD screen covers in a separate little plastic bag... it included a cloth to clean the screens before applying the hard-faced screen covers (which have worked like a charm). As for the cover, I found that, just as had been said, the phone looked like it was still slightly open with the cover on, but I cut off the small strip of plastic at the top of the keypad and trimmed the sides (when the phone is closed, look at the part that touches) and now it is much better. Now, it looks as good as a phone can with a cover on! I'd recommend this cover, keeping in mind that you might have to trim a few things."
3,It doesnt cover the lcd as it says,"i like the cover and the color but the package it came it stated that it covers the lcd and it doesnt. It doesnt cover the entire outside but thats it. It covers nothing of the inside screen which is what i really wanted. other than that its really nice, just not what i expected"
2,Cover doesn't close neatly and clear color is almost opaque,"When this cover is on the razr and the razr is closed, it looks like the razr is slightly open. Either the razr doesn't quite close all the way or the cover is sticking up where the front part of the razr meets the body. I tried to fit the cover on as tightly and neatly as I could, but it's not a streamlined look especially for a swish phone like the razr.The clear color is almost opaque gray/white. I can't see much of the phone's color through it at all."
4,Beautifully Illustrated,This book should really be read in conjuction with theIntroduction Mind and Brain book (by Angus Gellatly). Herethe authors give a more contemporary work on the humanbrain. Recent development are explained with clear andbeautiful illustrations. This is compared to the latterwhich gives a more historical view of the human brain interms of our understanding of it and what has been doneby neuroscientists and psychologists. I would recommend thisbook as a start for those interested in knowing more aboutthe human brain.
2,poor fit,"we've had this for over a year as, and have NOT been able to adjust it so that it fits correctly. it constantly shifts backwards on our 5 year old, and if we tighten it she complains that it's too tight. we've adjusted it every way possible, but it just doesn't fit her correctly. we have to go and buy a more traditional style helmet."
4,Love this lamp but not as much as the other...,"...I got another lamp from Kathy Ireland, it was a shorter one and it had a glass lamp shade with two chains to pull for the lights to come on and turn off.I love this lamp, don't get me wrong, it's looks nice and sophisticated but I like my other lamp from Kathy Ireland a lot better. Here's a link on Amazon for it... http://www.amazon.com/Kathy-Ireland-Collection-Accent-Table/dp/B0009JQRKO/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleIf you can't decide which one to get than I recommend the linked one moreso. (although that lamp is much more expensive now than when I purchased it but I still think it's a better lamp)This lamp has a fabric shade and you turn on the light by turning a knob on the lamp housing like most lamps. I really liked the chain pulls better though.I recommend this lamp, no question. It's just not as good as the other lamp Kathy Ireland sells but it is less expensive."
5,Can you tell me the email address of the author?,"I like this book very much, but I want to say something to the author by email ."
2,Over the top,Even though Wolf is a great guitar player his songs are just to mellow dramatic. He is a great solder and person but his hard life is not what I want to hear about when I'm in my car. He overproduced the album and it has lost it's edge. 911 is great in concept but the lyics are lost in production. Each song is like his Opus. Wolf have fun its Rock-N-Roll for Petes sake!!
5,Great resource for teachers of pre-k through 2nd grade,I like having this book to refer to when I am teaching the basic concepts of the Ten Commandments to pre-k and first graders in Jewish Schools. This book includes coloring pages as well as activities for kids to do.
5,Incomparable -- an easy resource book,"This is the classic comic book version of a telemark skiing text book: brief, clear narrative accompanying excellent cartoon drawings. The book shows both old style (knee down) and new style (no deep dips, feet never widely separated front to back) telemark techniques without really distinguishing between the two but, if you follow the exercises and advice, your skiing will improve. An enjoyable read, an attractive style and price."
2,Jammup,"Works fine as long as you NEVER put anything odd in it - no dollars, half dollars or foreign coins. It has to be dissassembled to clear the jam and will not operate with the top off. Very awkward. Also will not work with flat coin tubes."
4,Coin sorter works great!,"I was very impressed by this machine. It is the first one I used that can handle a large number of coins at once. The 4 slots for coins is an unexpected asset. In particular, when you have more of one type of coin, this comes in realy handy. The only down side I found for this machine is in how it handles irregular coins. Only being able to count 1, 5, 10 and 25 cent coins is nice, but it should have a way to eject the dollar or non US coins without unscrewing the top of the machine. Not a big issue and I still highly recommend this product."
2,"Good for home use, but not for business... too flimsy.","I purchased my FS-4DA from Sam's Club for the features of auto-advancing the coin tubes.My frustration came from occasional jamming, difficulty clearing the jams, and case plastic so cheap that the front panel hinges broke within days of first use.I gave this one to my son who likes to tear apart electronics to see how they work, but I've opted to upgrade to one in the $200-$250 range for my business use."
4,A great machine!,"Wonderful machine! Made with good quality materials and it works great for my business needs. I know it will last me a long time. I made the mistake of getting one of those cheesy plastic machines at Office Depot for $50. Needless to say, it didn't last long. You need to invest in a solid machine and not buy one of these dinky things.One slight annoyance: when the 4 tubes are full, it makes an annoying beeping sound.If you're looking for a solid coin counter, but this, you won't be disappointed."
3,A desirable item with conditions,"This is a desirable item that is efficient and easy to use. Special attention is needed to avoid having the loading lid closed while in use or a nasty jam will result. The coin meter is nice but of little value unless you are sorting large volumes of coins. All in all, an improvement over the cheaper model we had."
5,"Great value, not perfection.","While this product sorts (and counts) coins very well, it will not automatically toss aside non supported coins or foreign currency. It will occasionally jam, which is very easy to fix, and requires a bit of watching.It does over all an excellent job, and I am quite pleased with this product. As each tube fills out (the machine goes by count, so if you reset the counter REMEMBER TO EMPTY THE TUBES!!) it is pushed forward. As it fills the 4th of any denomination, it beeps for attention.All in all, a great solution for light to moderate commercial useage."
4,Does a pretty good job,"Does a pretty good job, just be careful not to drop any dollar coins in there."
1,Do not recommend,I purchased this machine from a catalog (hammacher schammler) at higer cost than amazon because of a gift certificate I was trying to use up. I recieved the unit in good working order and it malfunctioned after about one week. I counted about $1000 worth of coins saved over the years. I recieved a new one in about two days and this one didn't work right from the start. I think it is pure junk!!! Naturally its made in China. I would definitely NOT recommend buying it. It's more cost effective to use a coinstar machine despite the 9% fee.
4,convenient,"The sorter is easy to use, sorts quickly, and a lot easier than counting coin.Two drawbacks are: if you stop the machine, it loses count and you have to start over,and You should pick thru your change to remove anything foreign before starting as the machine will jam. I just roll the coin more often instead of trying to do a big batch. It will roll $100. in no time at all."
3,Should have stopped halfway through,"The first half of this book is amazing. The character development is well done - and the sex scenes are hot.Then about halfway through, the tone changes. Suddenly, we're meeting new characters in new settings. Some scenes (especially ones with Patricia and the SGT and Erin's ex, Mark) seem like they were added to take up space. Even the drama of the love-triangle is gone since we know who Erin picks.From there, the book plods until then end and the final resolution."
5,Terrific,This book is absolutely terrific. The story is suspenseful and compelling with all types of twists and turns. The author takes you on a such a journey that the words on each page actually come to life and you easily visualize every aspect of the story. The sex scenes are quite compelling. It is a must read.
5,A Sexual Awakening,An undercover detective is assigned to learn about a woman who just happens to be unhappy with her marriage. The two end up being lovers.
2,Need More Information,"The title of book seems pretty interesting. However, overall is not great. There should be more content especially the E-commerce topic."
3,OK book,"This is book is easy to understand, but I felt I was being told what the results were going to be like, not how to get there. Also, this doesn't account for things like birds flying up on the trail. It only talks about how to get your horse used to things like... a mattress?! I am skeptical about why my horse needs to know how to walk over a mattress. However, it would broaden his horizons. Overall, so-so."
3,Wasn't greatly impressed with the book/since I'm not a beginner,The book was ok but alot of stuff I was already doing with my horses. I would recommend it to someone who is just starting to learn how to despook horses.
5,bombproofing your horse,"This book is very easy to read, very well written. It didn't really provide me with any more information than I already knew. I guess this was written for someone who has absolutely no horse experience. But still worth the money and enjoyable to read with lots of good tips and points for training your horse."
4,Great Book!,I have skimmed thru and really like the steps to get my horse as close to bombproof as possible. Rating myself and my horse was good. I even had friends at the barn rate me (by what they have seen) and my horse for a more objective view. (we came out almost exact).Look forward to getting into details this winter when the weather slows down the trail riding!
4,Boomproof your horse,"Nice book with good Illustrations. It did not cover a couple of things I was looking for, but I would recommend it."
1,bombproof your horse,"worst book I could have purchased! A total waste of money. It didn't say anything or answer any questions. Chapter after chapter was pretty much ""put this on the ground ride your horse through it"" I would never buy another book written by this author. My friends looked at it and I couldn't even give it away! I didn't even want to give it one star."
5,Wow! This book is really helping,"my relationship between my horse and I is improving, we are both more confident and enjoy our time together more!! I thought I knew what I was doing... but this book opened my eyes to new techniques. It is also easy to read and apply."
5,Very helpful.,"This book show's several new ways for me to work with my horse to help build his confidence in noisy, busy situations. Can't wait to get started on his training so he'll be ready come Spring! Easy to understand."
4,"This is a cute, tiny book.","An excellent gift for your your favorite knitter, this little book is full of gorgeous pictures and interesting facts about knitting. A ribbon bookmark with a charm on the end adds to the gift nature of this book. I enjoy it."
3,Left my scalp dry and irritated..unfortunately.,"Got this along with the Creme Moelle De Bambou and the two together left my hair soft and shiny but I used it for 2 weeks and after the very first time my scalp became dry and irritated and just got worse from there. Perhaps I need a different formula from this line but for the price I would think that it wouldn't happen at all. I don't consider myself a sensitive person when it comes to hair products, have used many, so I was surprised by this. What a bummer..."
2,Arrived with a tear in it,"The doll arrived with a tear in it. It was shipped in very protective packaging (box and inside plastic ""bubble"" were in great condition) so it must have had the defect before then.I would not buy from this seller again until they fix their quality inspection process.P.S. Amazon did refund me 20% of the price as compensation. I ended up having to stitch up the tear myself since my child had become attached to it since seeing it come out of the box."
5,Disney's Goofy,The item was delivered promtly and as advertised. Thank You!! It was a pleasure doing business.
4,very portable and great price,"sturdy and portable - seat and lid snap on/off - crossbars pop out which make it foldable - perfect for travel - seat not comfortable for prolonged use, however price and portability make it a good choice"
4,"Great commode, Great price","When the commode was delivered, the box was beat-up, but the commode was in great shape. It's very sturdy, and works well. If I wanted to be really picky, it could have more height adjustments, but other than that--great product."
5,Great Product,This is a great products. Meets my needs.Easy to put together.Easy to Clean.Very sturdy.I like how the legs can be adjusted.
5,Good quality for good price,Bought this for an elderly relative who was coming to visit us for the holidays. She is about 300 pounds and this held up fine. Easy to empty and clean.
1,Feed Your Family for 12 a Day,"This book is a waste of money IF you have purchased her second book--Eat Healthy for 50 a week. It is virtually the same material--page for page all recipes are the same and the only real differences are an update on her family status and four new menus and shopping lists. The ""hypothetical family"" scenario is word for word the same as in her previous two books as is most of the other info in the other chapters. Save your money--only buy ONE of her books. Either will give you the same info."
2,Not impressed,"I liked The Tightwad Gazette, and I thought that this would give me some more money saving tips. I should have passed. The recipes would not go over well at my house, and overall it was a bust for me compared to The Tightwad Gazette Volumes 1 & 2 which I'd checked out of the library & read for free."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I chose to rate this product 1-star because it is not at all what I thought I was buying. The first word in the title says WIDE and it was nowhere near wide. It was maybe 4 inches. Yes, I should have looked at the dimensions, but when you advertise as a wide base then it should be one. Also, there is no way to hold the bigger items you want to display on it. I put my plate I wanted to display on it and it just kept slipping right off the stand. I held it on to at least see what it looked like and it wasn't even strong enough to hold it! it just opened up flat! This is definitely not a stand to use if you have something big/expensive to display."
1,False advertising,"While they may work great for a wide variety of applications I found these stands when I did a Google search for ""CD display racks"", looking for a display rack to hold the CDs I am selling while performing. I purchased them with that unique purpose in mind. Problem is that they are too wide to hold CDs. Very disappointed."
2,Nice but doesn't get the iPad off the counter,"Nice and sturdy, but the iPad is still down on the counter - taking up valuable counterspace and too close to the soup! I went with The Original Kitchen iPad Rack instead - […]"
5,The Best,"Not made for the iPad, but should be, works perfect as an iPad stand, either horizontal or vertical. Low price (and you get two of them) makes it a great buy, and perfect for travel."
3,Good Ideas,"This book has some great ideas, but I found the patterns themselves crudely drawn. The images look like old hand drawn sketches that were enlarged to fit the page. You could tell where additional lines were added to allow for reasonable glass cutting, and areas of the patterns that should have been symmetrical were not.I think a title of ""Celtic Stained Glass IDEA Book"" would be a more appropriate. I am not completely negative about this book. It has some interesting ideas, but just keep in mind that the pattern will have to be redrafted before getting a workable ""pattern""."
4,Useful patterns,"I have used several patterns from this book with great results. I did make small modifications, but I do that with most patterns! Many of these patterns are quite complex and some involve many, many pieces, but there are also a few that are great for beginners as well. If you are interested in celtic designs, this is the best glass pattern source I have found."
1,Not worth the price!,I purchased this item yet was unable to view the text myself. Once I did recieve the text in e-mail format it was very limited information all of which could be found elsewhere on the internet. It is certainly not worth the price!
3,not as good as it could be,"this is a really good movie....plot wise anyway. the editing was pretty bad though. some of the shots look they were filmed with a home video camera. there is some dubbing done on speaking parts that is really noticable. other than that, the movie is great. lots of martial arts action and some funny one-liners."
3,Excellent,"I thought this was an excellent movie, then acting was great, martial arts sequences were awesome and it was a beleivable plot line. Johnny and Jason did a great job, though it was very different from their acting on the PR series, that's probably what they were going for... All in all, 3/5 stars."
1,"The 1 star is for the DVD quality, the movie gets 3 stars.","The reason why I gave the DVD a 1 star is because I don't think the releasing company didn't even take the time to even remaster the soundtrack! The picture quality looks old, grainy and weathered, the image is distorted and the colors are uneven. The sound-quality is a Dolby Digital 2.0 track, and it sounds like snakes hissing at the screen, but I don't see any snakes. The movie isn't even in Widescreen Presentation it's in the lousy Fullscreen Version.Overall Grade:Picture: NO STARSSound: NO STARSMovie: *** out of *****In case you're wondering this movie stars two of the cast members from the original Power Rangers show! Watch only if you can stand the terrible picture and sound."
4,The Morning Breaks,"Once you get past the communist/revolutionary rhetoric of the 60's-70's, a portrait of a bright, intelligent human being is exposed.The case of Angela Davis is important for many reasons - but most importantly the right to free speech and to believe as you wish. That is what makes this country great."
2,Deceptive,Is it just me or are the Grizzly pictures and descriptions deceptive for the product purchased. For this sharpening stone there are clearly 3 stones in the picture and the description indicates 3 separate stone grits. I purchased this item thinking I would get 3 stones. I guess I need to be more careful but I would suggest the picture only be of the item for purchase. I haven't used the stone yet but will review that later.
4,Hand tools,"Product is great for sharpening the curved gouges as specified. The 1000 grit is really good as a medium grade, all around stone."
4,Really Good,"Finally, a good tool to really sharpen my gouges.This one makes all the difference except when it comes to ""veiners"" which require something different."
3,Great book to read in the Fall,"Dappled Apples is a whimsical romp through an apple orchard and pumpkin patch. I read this book with my 2 year old before we went apple picking, and it fit that context beautifully. It has simple, rhyming text, and the illustrations are vibrant and really stand out.I can't say it's one of my favorite picture books, but I will probably keep it on my list of books to get from the library each autumn."
4,My toddler loves this book!,"My 3 year old daughter adores Dappled Apples. We checked it out from the library right around her 3rd birthday, and she had it memorized in a couple of weeks. It is nice and short, and the rhymes make it easy for small children to remember the verses. So, we had to buy it from Amazon because she kept asking why we took it back! The book is great for the 3-4 age range because of its simplicity. Older kids might not find it as interesting."
5,I'm Totally Pleased!,"I'm totally pleased with the quality! My 10-month old daughter enjoys it thoroughly. I have played other tapes and she is not interested in viewing them. I'm searched extensively for videos with Small Fry quality and nothing compares to the colors, sounds, and real-life experiences you have offered in the Japanese version."
1,"Very disappointing, not designed for the 'everyday vegan'","I was very disappointed: this book didn't cover the ground I needed it to as I transitioned into veganism. The nutritional information is very basic, and 'coffee table' in manner, with some glaring inaccuracies that caused me to very unwell, until I was able to pick up some other books on Veganism.The recipes are hardly 'everyday' in form - relatively impractical if you don't live near a health food store.There are much better books here on Amazon on this topic."
2,Excess of Soy!,"Too many of the recipes call for soy or soybean products. Soy can have a sludging effect on one's body and disrupt the digestive process by weighing one down. Try one of Burton's other books instead, like ""Eat Drink, & Be Vegan."" ED&BV contains delicious eats without over-utilizing this maligned bean."
4,Great vegan get started book,I bought this book several years ago at the start of my vegan journey. It has been well loved and served my families taste buds well. Overall I would recommend to anyone starting out. Easy to follow and with east to access ingredients.
5,Cookbook Fave!,"I use this book quite often. I find the recipes to be reliable (this is an issue these days) and excellent. As a cane sugare-free vegan, I look for cookie recipes that use fruit or agave nectar as the sweetening source. ""Bill's Cookies"" are absolutely delicious. But all the recipes I tried are very good and I highly recommend this book to all vegans, just beginning and experienced."
4,This book was the story of his life and his Zionist activities,"Most interesting; Ha'am has never gotten the aclaim given to Herzl, but he was tirelessly dedicated to building a Jewish life and culture in the Turkish province of Palestine, the ancient home of the Jewish people.His work forms an interesting counterpoint to that of Herzl with whom he had many disagreements.I would have liked to have seen more excerpts from his original writings."
3,"defects in product, delay in shipping",To begin with the order took forever to get here. Just because they say an order may take 3 weeks doesn't mean it has to. So far I've found 3 discs with defects bad enough to stall my player. I haven't viewed them all yet. I may donate this one to the Library.
2,"Great Series, Terrible Product","DS9 is by far one of my favorite of all of the Star Trek shows, it provides so much depth and insight into many facets of the Star Trek Universe that not many of the other series... having said that, the build quality of these disks are terrible. They skip, they pause, they don't play correctly. The cases they come in are little better then plastic taped together (that's literally what it is made out of). I own all 7 seasons of TNG and the build quality is fantastic. I've never had a single problem with any of those disks and I've watched them tens of times. On my first run through with these BRAND NEW DS9 set, I've had to skip episodes because of how terrible the quality is. They freeze in the middle of episodes, skip and jump ahead. Terrible terrible terrible! I would highly recommend waiting for a new set to come out because this one is just worthless. On top of that the price they charge for this crap is outrageous."
5,Excellent but overpriced,"I love Deep space nine. I think it is one of the best science fiction TV series along with Babylon 5 and Stargate SG-1. It is definitely the best Star Trek spinoff. However, at $80 a season it is way overpriced; and that price is only if you buy the entire 7 season set. Individually they are $117!"
4,"A darker, messier ""Trek""","I can't believe no one's reviewed this series! It had its ups (""Trials and Tribble-ations"", ""Looking for Par Mach ..."", Odo & Quark, Sisko the statesman, strategist, & leader, Odo and Kira, virtually any Kai Winn episode) and it's downs (the Rat Pack crooner, the loooong Dominion-Federation war, I, for one, loathed Neela's Betty Boop persona). Part soap opera, part political drama, part smart, sophisticated and sometimes heart-breaking, other times wryly funny, ""Gunsmoke"" IN the stars. For those who like their Sci-fi / drama balanced between shadows and ""Trek"" optimism."
5,Fantasic (after the first season) series.,"I highly suggest DS9 to any Star Trek fan, or Battlestar Galactica fan who hasn't watched this series yet. I didn't watch DS9 on the air, I watched the entire series from beginning to end on DVD. This is truly the best way to watch the series.After Enterprise was canalled, I considered DS9 my last chance for ""new"" episodes of Star Trek. I'll admit, the first season is kind of tough to get through, there are some real stinkers, but it's totally worth it. The entire series is saga-based. The characters, stories, and setting are rich and deep. Everything seems to flow logically through-out the series. There are also some great ""all-in-one"" episodes; like one were the aliens are Roswell were Furangi, or where the DS9 crew visits Kirk's crew, appearing in original series uniforms.This fan trailer can tell you much more that I can in words: [...]"
3,"Great show, dissapointing presentation","This is not a critique of the show, easily the best of the four from 80's to 90's. The issue here is the DVD. Firstly, the shows are filmed in 35mm, that's Widescreen so why is the DVD in 4:3 only? Secondly, the images are mostly grainy and not the razor sharp image a DVD should offer. Granted, only my 42"" 3LCD HDTV I don't expect the expanded picture to be perfect, that's what HDDVD is for, but on a 27"" TV it should look spectaculer and it doesn't.Finally, the menu is horrible. Where's the ""play all"" feature, you have to watch each episode seperately and with opening and closing credits. Makes you wish the folks who did DVD's like Friends or Deadwood would have done this. It cost $400 for the series? I expect more for my money."
1,deep space 9,There are way to many freezes and pic. jumps they stink I hope that mine was the only bad set.
4,Great buy,"I was worried about the quality of the DVD when I read online about the pirate version out there. After watching the first episode, I am very happy with the picture. And the price is great. The only thing is the delivery was so late that it almost didn't make it before Christmas as this the present for my wife."
5,Nothing comes close....,"...to how awesome this television is. Over 7 seasons, this show consistently shines, as evidenced in my recent marathon viewing of all episodes seasons 1-7. I was so impressed how the acting, cinematography, directing, production and writing stands the test of time (the showed ran from 1992-1999.) Excellent."
1,Ridiculously Priced,Come on Amazon. What gives with your pricing system. These shows cost $50-$60 per season individually. Why are charging over $800 for the entire series set? And this is not a unique incident. You do this all of the time. DON'T BUY THIS SET.
5,Not really expensive when you think about it.....,"If you spend 16 dollars on a 2 hour movie, that is 8 dollars an hour.If you spend 500 dollars on these 7 seasons. (I got mine off of here for 350, but we'll use 500)That's 20 episodes a season.45 minutes and episode.105 total hours in the series.(note, these numbers do not include special features!!!)Do the math, and you're paying less than 5 dollars an hour.I rest my case"
1,One Time Watch,"I am glad I didn't buy this series. This series is a one time watch.... All it is. Its soup, Drama, & Star Trek. This is the type of series you half to see from the beginning. Once you know what happens it is not worth seeing again."
1,deep space nine,The product is not what it was advertised to be. This is a cheap copy of the original
5,Great DVD's,Never watched this series whiles on TV. Great continuince of Star Trek Series. A must watch for Star Trek fans!!!!
5,Great addition to our collection,My husband has always loved the DS9 series so I bought it for him for Chirstmas. I believe it was his favorite gift. The quality of the discs is very good. It took us a bit to figure out how to navigate through the espisodes but it is quite simple once we got the hang of it. We would absolutely recommend this product.
1,Skip and jump,"I always liked Deep Space Nine; have them on VHS tapes I recorded off regular TV when it was in reruns. So, I thought buying this set would be better than my old tapes, I was wrong. The DVD is packages poorly and how they burned them is pure crap. The first episode was good no problem but after that it was terrible froze frame, skipped, not what to expect from a new DVD. If the DVD would have been burned better like most good companies do, than it would have been worth the cost, but for the cheap quality of the transfer process, it's not worth it. In all Amazon did a good job, but was let down by crap from its seller."
3,"The Show Was Great, The DVDs Are Not","This is a great series. One of my favorite Treks. That's all the good I can say about this. The packaging is cheap and the little plastic clips holding the center of the dvd break off a lot. Many of the episodes skip or freeze. I've tried these dvds on several laptops and dvd players and it happened on all of them. I love the show, but I really don't like these dvds."
1,"Great series, horrible edition","I was excited to buy this since DS9 is my favorite series of all time. When I got it, however, it was to find that this was the WORST packaging I've ever seen. I've never been bothered by bad packaging before but this is so bad that it makes the discs difficult to get to and easy to damage. And then the further I got into watching the discs, the fewer of them would play. Most of the discs for seasons 5, 6, and 7 won't play at all - and by the time I found this out, it was too late to return the set. If you truly love this series, DO NOT buy this set - buy the individual seasons instead. The money I put on this was totally wasted."
3,Star Trek Deep Space Nine,Orginal set was missing the first dvd but replacement arrived in good order. Way over priced but an interesting series.
1,Silly pricing,"DS9 is my favorite Star Trek series. But as much as I like DS9, the $820 price tag is just insane. Of all the TV show DVDs, Star Trek shows are most expensive, thanks to greedy Paramount. :rolleyes:"
1,Worthless,"When you buy a box like this there is always the chance that maybe one (or in worst case two) discs will have problems. In this 48 disc box, maybe 4 or 5 disc worked! The box itself was very nice (we are now talking about al the things surrounding the discs), but to me it felt like the discs was homeproduced instead of something you would get from a store. About 10% out of 48 discs working? The chances that happens from a storebought box is.....well, I can't even calculated small numbers like that.In utter disgust the box was trashed immediately and it will be a cold day in hell before I shop from this seller again."
1,Not worth the extra money,As with many DVD sets for sale on Amazon it costs more to order the complete set than it does to simply click on each individual part of the set and stack them up in you shopping cart. Buy each season seperately and I think you'll find you save quite a bit of money.
1,Package Deal 2!!!,"WARNING!!! I do love the show and its well worth buying, but be sure you are buying this at the right price! You should see a price of around 320.00 for this set. I have seen it fluctuate up and down several times but that is the average price now. It seems that Amazon has placed a price on the complete series set at $818.99 Well what any smart shopper will notice that separately five of the single season sets go for $55.99 and season three and four going for $62.99 These can all be purchased separately here on Amazon for these prices. Figuring this out in a calculator shows that by buying the seasons separately you will spend around $406. How nice of amazon to package the whole thing together for us then double the price!!! Be careful, there are several of these ""package deals"" on Amazon."
4,Great series but some disk are bad copies,Great series . But some of the disk copies are bad Some of the final season seven disk are very grainie Also there are no instructions on how or where to replace bad disks.
5,Not your father's Star Trek...,"Even though all the previous 'STAR TREK' series were filmed in color, their stories were, for the most part, BLACK&WHITE..... And then came DS9, a study of Gene Roddenberry's universe in complex shades of gray. With thought provoking episodes like 'The Darkness and the Light', in which Kira is forced to confront the consequences of her actions as a member of the Bajorian resistance (considered a terrorist group by the Cardassians), and 'In the Pale Moonlight', where Sisco finds himself an unwitting accomplice in the assassination of a Romulan Senator and then an active participant in it's cover-up, DS9 will challenge as well as entertain you."
4,"Trekie, I am","I have been hooked on Star Trek since classic and while some critics did not like Deep Space Nine, seeing the entire series in continuity is well worth it. Great gift for the Trekie you know!"
5,perfect tea,This a lovely subtle tea that needs no sweeteners. It has a fantastic honey smell & is great for anytime of day. Since it is low in caffeine it's great to have @ night without any worries that it will keep you up. I was so happy to find it online (plus no shipping!) since my local store stopped carrying it.
1,1 out of 10,"Another decieving ad, was embaresed wehen I recoeived this item, it was not worth the $ I paid for it. best I can tell you ."
2,Too thin,"This is a huge book but spends no more then 1 page on any topic. In my opinion the authors only have financial audit experience and little understanding of IT controls. This book shows the failure of the 'integrated auditor' as the authors are tyring to be IT auditors with little IT experience. They touch on some very good points in a few instances and, in general, the book is decent. The authors do not know much outside of the CISA, IIA and financial based certifications as they seem to think that the ISSA (Information Systems Security Assoc.) is sponsored by ISC2/CISSP's (it is not). Overall, I have not been impressed with this book."
3,Academic Information,"Note: My review is on the first edition (2004). I don't know what improvements have been made since then.I've worked in the IT Auditing and Security field for the past seven years. And the general IT field for about 16 years. I read this book several years ago, to help me prepare for the CISA exam.This book is basically an academic introduction to Information Security and auditing. There's nothing wrong with that, and it gives useful information about the historical and legal environment we operate in. It also has general information about Risk Management, Change Management, and other general topics.However, if you're looking for practical information on HOW to do audits, or how to implement IT security, look elsewhere. There's nothing mentioned about audit techniques, best practices, case studies, tools, etc. For these, I'd recommend the book ""IT Auditing"" by Davis and Schiller."
4,A review from a California State U accounting professor,"Information Technology Control and Audit (3rd edition) by Senft and Gallegos is a good, solid text. Its topical coverage is the most comprehensive I've seen in a book for this market. In addition, the text clearly benefits from the extensive educational and experiential backgrounds of the authors; examples and illustrations are practical and relevant. The writing style is clear and engaging, as well. Most students, either graduate or undergraduate, would find this book a valuable addition to their professional library."
5,Solid reference for IT auditing -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!,"I highly recommend this book because it is an excellent resource of IT auditing. I found this book is very helpful for beginners to understand the big picture of IT internal control and audit procedures.The book's major strength is that it provides good and detailed descriptions of IT audit and controls. The authors shared several practical experiences in IT auditing along with actual audit projects. The book provides great tools and technique for solving audit, control, and security problems. The career planning and development chapter was really helping me establish a career development plan. The appendixes also include valuable case studies, professional standards, and sample audit programs."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"I used this book for my first exposure to IT auditing. I found it was so thick it was difficult to walk away with a solid concept most of the time. I am sure it would make a great deal of sense to a very technical person who understands the ins and outs of networking and firewalls and who is comfortable just opening a new application and picking it a part, but I am a method person. I either need examples to extrapolate from or a step by step to get a deeper understanding. I have a strong business background, so I was able to apply that to application concepts. I just don't think I have had enough implementation experience to make the most of some of the concepts."
4,Excellent resource for Auditors and Security Professionals,"The text gives a good background of Information Systems Auditing methodology and best practices. Although some of the examples of Computer Auditing Tools and references to Y2k issues are a bit dated, I recommend this text as a must read for anyone deciding to enter into the IS Auditing field and should be on the shelf of any security professional who wishes to understand IS Auditing practices. I look forward to seeing an updated version of ITCA which includes more in-depth discussions about the impact of Sarbanes-Oxley and other sweeping legislation, updated information about tools and security hazards to be on the lookout for in the course of an audit and more emphasis on incorporating CoBIT into auditing plans."
4,Recommended!,"As an incoming IS Audit student, and future professional, this book was instrumental in teaching the core concepts of what IS auditing is about. This book covers many topics and gives a general overview of various IT topics, from controls to telecommunications, to application control, etc. If you are looking for a book for specifics on how to do an IT audit, this will not cover it too deeply. This is more of a overview of the IS audit field and what to expect if one is going into this career. Overall a great solid book."
4,Information Technology Control and Audit Book Review,"Information Technology Control and Audit is an excellent reference to IT auditing for beginners. The text book covers a wide range of topics such as the audit process, the legal environment of IT auditing, security and privacy and much more. For those considering a career in the IT auditing field, there is a chapter devoted to IS Audit Career Planning, with insightful tips on how to get ahead.Overall, the textbook offers a colorful look into IT audit and control from experienced co-authors in the industry. Defintely recommended for those who would like an complete overview of IT auditing."
4,Information Technology Control and Audit,"I find out that this book is very useful source for everyone who is in the IS audit field or everyone who wants to learn more about IS audit field. This book not only discusses the IS audit materials in detail, but also briefly reviews the Professional Organizations relate to IS audit field and gives a good sample of audit programs that I find to be very helpful. However, the one star missed from this book is for the book layout. Using more color will be nice !"
5,Great book to understand IS auditing in general.,"This book was written by a couple of very experienced professionals in IS auditing fields. It~{!/~}s a good book in terms of systematically documenting latest IS auditing practices and almost everything related to IS auditing concerns, covering IS auditing standards and guidelines, IS audit process and planning, control design and implementation, auditing of applications and operations, CAATTs, legal issues related to IS auditing, and even outlook of IS auditing in the New Millennium. It provides great help for people who like to enter into this field in understanding the whole picture of IS auditing and gaining knowledge to pursue auditing career."
4,My short-list for re-reads,I first read this in my high school English class and while it is was a curriculum book I really enjoyed it. It played very well on the post-apocalyptic genre and adding in that it is based in a city that I am from made it more enjoyable to read.The writing style flows very well and the language isn't too advanced for younger readers but at the same time just right for an older crowd of book-lover.
3,Almost Everything I Could Ask For...,"Was absolutely delighted to receive the SmartPad for Christmas. It gives me the opportunity to write and compile notes, enter appointment and calendar information directly into my Palm on regular notebook paper and the notebook itself is sleek and visually tasteful. Was not so delighted to discover that Seiko had not designed the system to be multi-platform. When I contacted them, they said there are no plans currently to write a Mac application. This detail leaves out a huge marketshare of Palm users. So while this is a big step forward, not everyone can use it. Hopefully, this year will see some movement to create more Mac applications on Palm peripherals!"
3,Un Easy Phones,"These headphones are great!!! if you only plan on using them once or twice. They eaisly tangle and are VERY flimsy. I wouldnt suggest these for a child either because the ear pieces are irregularly LARGE. They are very uncomfotable, even for me as an adult."
5,Excellent reference and a handy review of Catholic teaching,"Perfectly orthodox, embracing the Second Vatican Council within the Sacred Tradition of the Church in what Pope Benedict has referred to as the ""Hermeneutics of Continuity"", and very readable. This book is a great and faithful reference to the teachings and doctrine of the Catholic Church throughout all of her history. Catholic or those curious as to what the Church teaches, will find this book very helpful and perhaps drawn to Fr. Hardon's full Catechism, which even goes deeper than this.I strongly endorse this text.Peace,"
2,It's Okay.,"I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about with this product. I'm a total kitchen gadget junkie and so I was delighted when I received this for Christmas. Yes, it's more ergonomic to hold and it's a little easier for me to slice up small bits of pizza for my toddler, but it's not *all that*. The problem is the thing is so irritating to wash that I find myself just reaching for my regular pizza cutter instead of this one. Basically you have to take it out of its plastic case to wash it which can be rather tricky. I keep worrying I'm going to slice myself with the blade. Even putting it back together after it's clean is a bit nerve racking. Frankly all this business of taking it apart and putting it together sort of nullifies the ergonomic aspect of it for me.I'd say if you already have a pizza cutter that you're happy with you don't need to bother with this thing."
5,Zyliss Pizza cutter works great!,"I love this pizza cutter. Well made, reasonable price, good value for the money."
5,Fabulous,"I saw Alton Brown use this on ""Good Eats"" and decided to try it. Cuts pizza great! Really comfortable to use, pops apart (just be careful of the blade) and is dishwasher safe!"
4,"Flawed, but good","I bought this cutter ages ago to replace the standard handled pizza cutter I'd had, and wasn't pleased with. At first blush, this thing is perfect. And really, it's very good. Feels much more natural, and is much easier to cut with than the old fashioned standard handled cutter.The drawback (and this really is small, but something one should know) is getting the thing clean. The plastic casing, the handle, is supposed to swing open so you can clean it. But man alive, the thing is HARD TO OPEN. Given that there's a big honkin' blade sticking out of it (and I have a slight blade phobia), it's difficult to get a really good grip, and the plastic is so stiff it's hard to get open. Doable, but difficult.All in all, I recommend it over a standard pizza cutter hands down. If I could give 4 3/4 stars, I would."
5,This product is a must for Ebookman users.,"I've had my adapter for a few days now and have no complaints to make. If you are planning to use the backlight or speaker on your Ebookman for any extended periods of time you need to get this adapter or you'll find yourself spending a fortune in batterys. The adapter is compact, light weight, and has a wonderfully long cord. : )"
4,Secret and not so secret places in Southern Africa,"Getaway has wonderful artices on Southern Africa, focussing on destinations in South Africa. Very good articles on everyhting from luxury bush camps to rough hiking trails. Particularly enjoy readers' comments on places to go and others to avoid. As a South African, I always read it for relevant articles before heading off to explore our beautiful country, from the Kalahari Desert, the world's oldest, to the Game Farms bordering the world famous Kruger Park, Getaway does them justice."
5,Another Aussie Great,"This CD has to be one of the best undiscovered gems of the past year.......Perfectly put together with great vocals, production and songs that are truly memorable. Not sure what it is about Australian singer songwriters, but they always seem to deliver something that can't be found elsewhere. If you like the Finn Brothers, Shane Nicholson and Alex Lloyd, all artists from Australia and New Zealand, then give this a try. You'll be glad you did!"
5,R. Smith Kiliper,"I met R. Smith Kiliper back in the late 80's when he was living in the small town of Antler, North Dakota. I was working at a small television station and we went to do a story on him. Antler is located in the far northern part of the state and his intention was to turn it into a Christmas theme town with shops that sold Christmas items throughout the year and brought in customers from all around. It was then that I first became familiar with 'The Night Before the Night Before Christmas' and it's companion book 'The 365 Days of Christmas' which I now own. Both are charming childrens books unlike anything a person is likely to find easily. Both were written by R. Smith Kiliper. I don't believe he was successful in turning Antler into a Christmas theme town but there were some shops that tried to get off the ground. It was an interesting and very pleasant experience both meeting him and seeing the town as he envisioned it."
2,it is what you pay for,I payed 3 bucks for this remote. I can't complain at the price and the functionality of the device fits the price. It is difficult to use and the sensor works less than half the time and only at close range. It is not an official xbox remote. It has an xbox button on it but it is a total knock off- doesn't even light up when it is on. I would not buy this product again. I would rather spend more money and buy a product that works better.
1,Complete junk.,"Yes, it is cheap, but it's CHEAP. You would have to pay me to even try to use this again. Spend a bit more and get something that works."
1,Terrible Junk,"This remote came out of the package & never once worked. It does not turn on. The package labeling is absurd and offers no usage instructions whatsoever. Package says ""DVD Movie Playback Kit"" on the back, even though that's not what it is. It also says it requires two AAA batteries, but opening it you find it needs two *AA* batteries. It says to read all accompanying information, yet there is *none* - no manual, no insert of any kind. The end of the English section on the back of the package says ""For Xbox customer service in the"" - and that's it, nothing more. The packaging is also labeled at the bottom as being manufactured by Microsoft Corporation, yet this absolutely is not Microsoft quality at all. I think this is an illegal copy of Microsoft's universal remote, and seems like something I'd picked up at the local dollar store. Just junk. We are so disappointed."
3,Works for the Most Part,"All features/buttons present on this remote work properly and mimic Xbox 360 remote, but these buttons are a bit flimsy. Not sure how long this will continue to function. The purchase makes sense for the price."
1,Doesn't Work,"Simply put, this item does not work at all. Only a piece of plastic with buttons. I placed batteries in it, but it does not connect to the xbox or show any signs it has power."
1,Should of read review,Remote does not work. I got it to open the xbox once. I switched batteries. Nothing works. That's what I get for not reading reviews.
1,It's true.. It won't work if your more then 4 feet away!,I should have listened to everyone when they said it only works 4 feet away from the Xbox360. And not an inch more! Pay the few extra bucks and buy any other one out on the market. Unless you actually sit 4 feet away from your xbox360 then it works just fine and dose everything it says.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"This doesn't work, LITERALLY. What a POS. I'm contacting Amazon, but unless they want to send a UPS guy to pick this up, I'm not making an effort to go anywhere to ship it back or using ink to print a return label. I'll eat the $6 and use the experience as a lesson. In case someone thinks I just got a dud...it's so cheaply made, I can tell with a 2"" drop to a carpeted floor...it would quit."
4,ITS OK,I LIKE THE REMOTE I JUST WISH IT WOULD READ FROM A FURTHER DISTANCE. I SOMETIMES HAVE TROUBLE GETTING IT TO READ THE XBOX. TAKES A WHILE TO REGISTER. BUT IT STILL WORKS FOR THE MOST PART.
2,weak,"Cheaply made, and not even the product in the picture. Fortunately it works...albeit only if directly in front of xbox. Cheap and gets the job done"
4,it was pretty ok,"This remote would have been better if it came with instructions, but i figured it out myself. You connect my pushing the ""internet"" button. It was pretty good though. the buttons were a little bit hard to push, but it's not too bad. I can use it for the xbox, not just the dvd. What made this useful was that, my dad didn't know what an xbox was. He would kill me, if I said it was a game system. So I said it was a dvd player. then i hid the controller, and put in the remote, and taped up the box, so when he opened it up, it was like a legit dvd player. thank you for reading this."
3,Xbox Remote,I got this product for my family to be able to watch movies easier on my xbox. We haven't really had a reason to use it yet. It didn't even come with directions. The only buttons that I know to work is the open/close and power buttons.
2,Go ahead and spend the extra...,"Go ahead and spend the few extra dollars to get the actual Microsoft controller. While this one works, it came with no setup instructions, took 3 people to finally get it to work, has a rather short range, and has to be pointed directly at the IR receiver in almost a straight line."
1,This company should be banned!,The Universl Remote is a cheap knockoff and not the Microsoft brande one they use in their image. It doesn't work whatsoever and I definitely do not recommend this company to anyone. SHAME ON YOU!
2,Sort of works,"It's pretty much true what the other reviews are saying. Yes, it works, but you have to go into console settings and enable it. That's not something that's readily apparent from the packaging. That frustrated my at first and I had to get out my camera with IR sensitive night vision to make sure it was doing anything. It does work, it's just got a very weak signal. You have to be close, and hit the right angle for it to work. That said, it's five bucks. The way my rooms set up it works for me, but someone with the box on the other side of the room would have trouble. If I had to do it again, I'd spring 10 more and get a used one at gamestop that would control the sound of the tv as well. But really, it's five bucks and has 1/3 of the functionality, so... its a five dollar remote."
1,"Knockoff item, barely works. Don't buy!","This remote is not made by Microsoft and doesn't have any XBox logos on it.The remote must be held within 4' of the XBox 360 in order to work, and always directly in front.I wish I knew this before purchasing because this item is basically useless. Stick with your game controller instead of buying this."
1,Not as advertised!,This device was not as it is advertised at all. It is advertised as a new remote and the picture shows it to be in the original box but instead it comes wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap and appears to be a used remote! I should have read the reviews first.
4,small and cheap,"The remote is small and does what i wanted it to do. Allows me to play, pause, fast foward...basically its a dvd remote. My only complaint is that the buttons need to pressed rather firmly. The remote is cheap and made in china so i think the reason the buttons are like that is just because its a cheap little thing. But if you want a remote to watch dvds without having to use your xbox controller its not bad for the small price tag."
1,"Awful, just awful!","I was optimistic after reading reviews of this and I should have listened.It is not of ""Microsoft"" quality at all whatsoever. I am sending it back and disappointed that I had to pay shipping twice on this.[...]"
1,This controller has no power!,"The price was excellent and certainly inexpensive and now I know why. The controller works, but only if I am standing about 5 feet away from my Xbox. If I sit down to use it with my Netflix or Hulu Plus, the signal can't reach beyond the 5 foot mark. Totally useless."
3,Ok,For the money I guess it's worth it. Seems a bit chinsey for even an after market item. But for the money. It's a deal.
1,HOW DO YOU SYNC IT? NO SYNC BUTTON,How the heck do you get this to work? I would think you would need to sync the remote just like you do controllers but there is no button for it.HOW DO YOU SYNC IT?No instructions.
1,awful clone of orignial,"the remote i received barely works, you have to be pointing it right at the IR receiver on the xbox with snipers precision. the build quality isn't very good either. the plastic is very thin, and it feels like something that came with a happy meal. i threw mine away after a few weeks of not using it, i didn't want to bother with sending it back. save your self the time and frustration and DO NOT BUY IT!"
1,direct deals 4u xbox 360 controller,"i ordered this product from one of amazons vendors ( direct deals 4u ) - i guess the saying goes...you buy cheap...you get cheap! first off the vendor sent me a controller that was not the one as advertised. compared to the actual OEM this was a bad immitation and did not work.i gave direct deals 4u a rating of one but and asked for a refund... in order for me to get my money back they wanted me to remove my rating... kind of mad that i did and should have made a claim with amazon...here is a copy of an email that was sent:We will be happy to help you with the refund, help us get that feedback removed so I can have my boss approve it quickly for you.Thank you!Sebastian SaaDirectDeals4U[e-mail address removed]720.259.7786XBOX 360 Universal Media Remote Controldirect deals 4 u should be a shamed of that! bad business!!!"
3,Not too bad not too great just ok,You have to point it directly at the 360 for the controls to work. Otherwise it's just a remote like any other remote. On a side note the batteries that came with it where rusted out and looked horrible so they went straight in the trash. For $5 I wasn't expecting much and you get what you pay for. I mostly use my ps3 for netflix and I have the bluetooth remote for that but I got tired of leaving it on the couch and accidently turning my ps3 on when i sat down so i got this. can't really complain for the price.
3,Disappointing direction and production,"Andrea Bocelli was brilliant as always; however, the director and producer did not demonstrate equal surpassing excellence."
5,Andrea,"If you love Andrea, you will love this beautiful DVD. The scenery alone is reason enough to buy it. But of course, it is Andrea and his gorgeous voice that makes it a 5 star!"
5,Tuscan Dreams,"What beautiful scenery; this along with Andrea Bocelli singing to me what more could a woman want?This DVD is a treasure. It shows you how deeply this tenor appreciates family, nature, music. I truly enjoyed this and hope others will also."
5,terrific..........,This video reveals a side of Bocelli not seen before........It gives you a sense of who he really is.......An Italian tenor who is alot more than just another great voice.......I especially admired his deep feeling for his roots and his interaction with his family.......I enjoyed the whole experience........
5,DAMN!!! How come I can't give more stars to this DVD~,"OMG!!! Absolutely OMG!!! I like the songs in his CD ""Cieli di Toscana"" pretty much already, but this DVD mixed with the MTV that make the songs sound 10 times better!! It makes me feel like I understand and feel the songs more deeply and more passionately. When Bocelli's voice came out, u just cant resist but stay in front of the TV to listen he sings and watch the gorgeous MTV. Overall it brings u to the inside world of the songs. Personally I like the video of E Sara' A Settembre the most, but actually all videos are worth more than 10 stars. I am only 22, but I choose to listen bocelli's masterpieces instead of those stupid pops that has no talent or even no voices. This shows how charming bocelli's songs and voice are, I can guarantee after u listening and watching this, u would understand what ""beautiful music"" really means. Trust me~"
2,Overly Sentimental,"I'm sorry to be the party pooper here, but I think this DVD is overly sentimental; it forces emotion and lacks substancial debth. Yes, the scenery is stunning, but the beauty of human relationships it attempts to convey is lacking. The scenes of the male model holding the baby for example, are just plain silly. I don't feel any love or relational debth when I watch them. It's just some guy with an above average body holding a baby as though he's not quite sure what to do with it.With that said, the best chapter on the DVD was ""L'Abitudine"" with Andrea and Helena Hellwig at the recording studio. That was raw and real.Andrea Bocelli's singing is beautiful; and this DVD fails to do that beauty justice."
4,Inspector Morse Set Eleven: The Wench is Dead,I am a fan of Inspector Morse and was sorry that the series is gone. This set of DVDs is excellentand John Thaw was quite poignant as his health declined.
4,An interesting mystery...,"Set in modern England, the Inspector Morse series is well-known. I was introduced to it by accident, seeing ""The wench is dead"" as my first exposure. The inspector is hospitalized, and reads a book about a century old murder and the trial of the accused. To Morse, who is a sharp investigator, the trial was a farce, and the wrong men were hanged, so he sets about re-investigating everything, and comes to a wholy different conclusion, which has a surprise ending!"
3,The Wench Is Dead... and so is Morse,"Inspectors Lewis and Foyle are more to my liking.Morse is just too much the grouch and curmudgeon, too condescending to those around him.Also, these DVDs have been out long enough to have captioning. We Americans speak English, but not ENGLISH."
5,Why are there only two titles by this guy? He's terrific!,"To coin a 'commercial phrase', I'm a very choosy reader. I don't buy a book because of its intriguing cover, and I don't buy it because of the back jacket blurb. I buy it if the first page captures my interest. Yup. I stand right there in the bookstore aisle and read page one. The Bog Spell got me a good scolding from the guy behind the counter: ""Hey, you gonna buy that book, or you plannin' to read the whole thing, right here?"" I bought the book. And I loved every page."
2,Over his head,"Though I like Krishnamurti's work in general, this is a [weak] one. Since he is anti-organization, anti-teacher he dimisses all the mystics and spiritual teachers who ever lived. They don't know but since I'm free of all that dogma and rigid teachings I know best sums up Krisnamurti's thought on god. This borders on egomania. Sadly by lowering the topic to such a low level of discourse he makes himself no better than any new age kook. Since he had no method per se and dismisses any sort development of higher level perceptions he puts himself in a box all alone. It's too bad his experience with Theosophy ruined his opinion of teachers and organizations.This book could perhaps stand as signpost as too how far rational thinking can take a person. Get the book if you're interested and then get Underhill's ""Mysticism"" and Helminski's ""Living Presence"". Compare them and see who has a better understanding of spirituality and God."
2,GOOD BOOK,"Yes, it is a good book. The only problem I have with it is that Krishnamurti is not willing to investigate world religions. He just ASSUMES that they are all wrong. I'm not saying that they are right, but a true scientist must be open to all possibilities. K is obviously not. He brings all his ideas to a level that is so low, that no one can possibly argue with him. He never read anything and so it is easy for him to criticize all the great thinkers. He never read St. Thomas Aquinas so I wonder how he would be arguying about Thomas' five proofs of God's existence. But he doesn't want to deal with all of that, so he just brings everything to an incredibly low level where only he is right. He also rejects all mystics, knowing that there have been mystics in all religions since the beginning of man.I like Krishnamurti. There is a lot of good stuff in what he teaches. But his method of finding the truth is not always very scientific."
3,Perfect for lazy summer weekends,"Fun book all the way around, from the Barbie-pink pages to the cover, not to mention the contents. This was at times a Barbie that I could have never imagined. My favorite story is ""Twelve-Step Barbie"", in which she lives in the L.A. area and as the title indicates has been out and about. There were some cult Barbies in ""The Barbie Murders"", a good sci-fi thriller. Another great story is ""Barbie Comes Out"" (one thing I love about this compilation is the self-explanatory titles). This was a fun adventure, and a perfect read for lazy summer weekends."
4,Great Resource - Hope for my child,"This book is like an answer to my prayers. Finally a doctor who gets it -- my child is not faking it, looking for attention or drugs, but has real pain with no known source. Frustrating. But this book provides some great guidance for us as parents, help for our child and is a good resource to share with her doctors. Thank you Dr. Seltzer!"
4,"Success, relativity speaking.","The scientists aren't gonna like this one! Using modern science to have a more effective experience of life. I'm betting readers of this book will have to prove Anthony's theories for themselves. If they do, there'll be no limits on what they can do, IMO. I've started the work Anthony has suggested and it feels right. May I suggest all books be coil-bound? That is SO convenient."
3,SHE MARRIED THE MAN SHE HAD THE AFFAIR WITH!,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound judgmental but Sandy Patty admits to making poor choices (very admirable)and after seeking restoration and finding peace from God, she married the man she had the affair with and lives happily ever after! Am I missing something here, because I just don't get it?? One thing I do get though, is that her career never recovered. But I do give her credit for one thing, though. She has never compromised in her music."
1,Enough Already,"Fine!Patty and Amy Grant are talented performers, but let's cut out the piety. I will continue to enjoy their recordings, but I wish they would stop presenting themselves as suffering Christians. Their lives are as messy as those of the other performers we read about in the tabloids. But should we all be writing books about our failings? Patti and Grant should stick to secular music; they perform it better anyhow."
1,Poor Quality,"Maybe the earlier ones were better, but the one I received was poor. The large lens is nice, but the lights are dim. The arms were dented and would not extend properly because plain and simple poor fit and assembly. The clamp was far too small for this lamp and if I had used it I am sure it would have broken. I explained all this in an email to the distributor requesting a return and still I was charged a restocking fee and shipping both ways. Bottom line, spend more for something made where quality matters."
3,Big is better ?,"I guess this lamp does the job after 6 months. It seems solid enough and no surprises so far. Make sure you look at the dimensions : It is BIG and the light is very ""industrial"" neon..."
5,The Irish in the South,"I have enjoyed this book, it has so much historical information. The author did a lot of research for it."
5,Informative Book,"Item as described, arrived in good shape in a timely fashion. Very nicely compiled. Would do business with again."
1,Terrible Phone,"We replaced our previous Uniden phone with this one and it is terrible. The sound cuts in and out and when it goes out, you can't even hear the other person, or your own feedback in the earpiece. The reception is terrible, I can't even get a clear sound in my bedroom, 25 feet from the base. We replaced a 900MHZ that was much better than this phone. I called Uniden, and was told it wasn't their problem, but I can send it in for repair if I'd like. The phone was terrible from the day I bought it. We are now shopping for a replacement."
2,Terrible reception,"Good features, good price, terrible reception. Static interference from the room adjacent to where I kept the phone. If you don't plan on leaving the room where the base unit is (or maybe if you live somewhere with minimal interference) you can get by with it."
2,Poor reception - try the 900MHz version - it's great!,"I'm sure this could actually be a great phone if you are not living in an area with a concentration electronics and wireless devices.The features were wonderful, and I was immensely pleased with everything except the reception which was poor at any distance greater than 1 foot. While it is fair to expect some interference from wireless LANs (mine, like most runs at 2.4 GHz) this was completely unworkable.If you have a lot of electronics around or live in appartment, then get the 900MHz version (EXAI-398). It works perfectly and has the same features."
1,go digital,I got 1 of these phones a few months ago & haven't been happy with the clarity or the range. My old 900mhz digital uniden works better than this one does. The handset has to be within 6 inches of the base to have a clear signal without static or interfereance. I will be returning this phone & getting one that has the digital spread spectrum technology. (Thank You to Target for the 90 day return policy.) This phone has a digital answering machine which is not the same thing as a digital phone signal between the handset & base. If you want a 2.4ghz phone I would recomend that you spend the extra money for a better phone than this one.
2,Horrible reception,"Phone has tons of good features, but the reception is sub-par. Sounds like you're talking inside a box. I would not recommend this phone to anyone, especially for the price."
3,PARENT Uniden 2248,I love this digital camera. I use it all the time! I can take pics and load them on the computer quickly and effitiently. Out of all the cameras that I have this one is my favorite. This cam is the best if you want a cam for a low price. This cam will last a while some people dont like it and I can understand some of the things on this cam are not so great that is why I only put 3 stars instead of 5.
4,almost perfect except......,"This nifty little cordless Uniden is great, has many useful features such as digital answering machine with the option of manual or prerecording personal messages, able to store up to 10 phone numbers, rocketdialing for quick dial, volume control on both the handset and base, caller ID, and some other minor functions. I received this item and tested for 2 weeks, and so far, so good. If this phone had a ""hold"" bult into it, I would give it a full 5, but hay, you cant beat the price."
1,Mike from Jersey City,Reseption is just terrible. I can't use it. Also it is very inconvenient to use. I am thinking to buy Panasonic.
2,Not worth the savings,"This phone sounds fine when you are talking to someone. However, it has two big flaws that give it the 2 star rating. The first problem is that when you hang it up to recharge it doesn't easily start charging. You need to mess with the recever to get it in there just right. The other problem is with the answering machine. You can hear incoming messages just fine, but the ""please leave a message"" callers hear is very fuzzy and I can't make it any clearer."
5,Hi-larious,"I have seen this movie several times now and still laugh like it is my first time. Jennifer Lewis creates a wonderful person in Jackie Washington. I find myself singing the songs all the time. I love ""Look at me"" ""Sookie Sookie MaMa"" ""Eyes on the motherland or cleveland"" Don't miss it. Ahhh man I got some taco juice on my sleve..."
5,One of my favorite films ever,"Very few films hold up to repeat viewing like this one -- especially comedies, which sometimes become less funny when you've already heard the jokes. This is a film that just keeps giving and giving laughs no matter how many times or how often it's viewed. It's difficult to pick out favorite parts because so much of it is great, but I particularly liked Aphrodite in a Nighty and Jackie as Coco taking on Rudy Rae Moore. But, really, the first 95% of this film will leave you in stitches. As others have already written, the ending is a little sappy and seems forced, but it doesn't ruin what is otherwise a great comedy."
5,Jackie's Back And How!!!,"If you have not seen this spoof on the entertainment business, you have truly missed out. From the moment this film starts and to the final credits rolling, it is one belly-laugh after another.The script,cast,and director(Robert Townsend)are first rate.(These are three essential ingredients for a great comedy.) Jenifer Lewis does a top-notch job as ""Jackie Washington"".It's a shame that this film was not a theatrical feature.Jenifer Lewis could have been nominated for an Academy Award.Do not ""YIELD, YIELD,YIELD"".See this ""Portrait of a Diva"" and become a fan too."
4,Very funny ...,"We saw this on TV and it is funny. The first half is a laugh-out-loud slew of one liners. Then the sappier stuff kicks in and it's energy fades. My partner loves this DVD, though. Now I understand how parents feel when they have kids, a dvd player, and Disney films."
1,"Oh my god,","This is the kind of movie that when your watching it your asking yourself, ""Why am I watching this move?!"" It's so terrible that it's good!"
2,"Meets Needs, but False advertisement","I ordered this cable hoping that it would help with getting away from the limited use of the USB cradle due to the fact that I have a PDA case that requires velcro on the back. With the velcro, the once natural fit of the eBookman on the cradle becomes too snug and I am afraid I am going to damage the unit everytime I attach the device on. In turn, I purchased the USB cable, but the picture that Amazon shows is a long ""version"" of the cord. Looking closer, it looks like they just chopped off the USB cable from a cradle and showed that, being that cable is longer. In reality, the cable is a very short limited one. No wonder they offer it for 51% off. But oh, do they make up for the cost in shipping and handling. When I got the product and saw how short it was, I was naturally disappointed. I was looking for a long USB cable as advertised, long and convienent, and instead I got a limited short reachability."
1,DVD Doesn't have any sound!,"just inserted the DVD, which was one of the reasons I bought this book, and the DVD will only play silent video without any sound. Also seems to be missing some sort of root menu. VERY disappointed."
1,"If ANY experience with AIX, this will be a disappointment.","This book is for beginners and doesn't have much depth. Even if you buy this book only for basic commands and basic administrative tools, then you've already spent too much and you'll be very disappointed. You would think 3 people from IBM would be able to put together a pretty good book about their own operating system. Still upholding the IBM mantra, ""It'll be in the next version""."
3,Pretty nice for 100 bucks,"This desk is an amazing value. Looks nice though six hours later it's still not assembled. UGH...My desk was packed well and was pristine coming out of the box, but the assembly has been a hassle. A couple of the screws didn't fit into the locks properly. I'm taking the rest of the night off, and will be back at it tomorrow. I do like this piece and it goes great with the mission folding bookcases - which require no assembly at all!!!!"
2,Nice desk...if it's not broken when you get it.,"Save yourself from disappointment...this desk doesn't ship well. When I got mine the front corners of the desktop were totally smashed. Shipping it back is a hassle because it's such a huge package, and you can't return it to Target retail stores. Basically, this is just a waste of time and shipping cost."
2,Broken top - try and get replacement - good luck,"The item is not packed well for shipping. The drawer and top were cracked. When I called the number on the replacement part, I was told did not have the replacement. They gave me a number to call for Target, THEY in turn told me they couldn't send it and told me to call the number I had just called.UNREAL trying to get this fixed. I am going to have to pack the WHOLE thing up and return myself. NO HELP IN GETTING THIS TAKEN CARE OF."
2,Mission computer desk,"Very hard to put together, drawers came broken both times- cute though- not at all sturdy"
4,"""A MUST have""","I thought about buying this desk a couple of times. I was sure it was made out of that pressed partical board that most others are made from, but found out that I was wrong. It is made out of real wood and putting it togeather was a snap. The Directions were easy to read, easy to follow and I had it all together and my computer hooked up in about 35 minutes. Its very stirty and doesnt wobble around. The price is right and the quality is fantastic! This a MUST have for the money!"
3,Warped top,"Desk was extremely well-packaged with no damage except one camlock case was broken. Miraculously, an extra one was provided. Assembly went very well until I attempted to set the top onto the base of the desk. It was warped, which made it impossible to lock the two front camlocks. Therefore, only the two short screws above each drawer hold the front of the top onto the base. It seems to be sturdy enough, so have decided to leave it as is instead of going through the nightmare of trying to get a replacement. Love the keyboard drawer and have no problem using mouse on top of desk. Nice looking, price is right, but buyer beware!"
2,This is the bad.,I hate how Nelvana disordered these episodes. This has got to be one pf the worst Cardcaptors tapes. They have one of the more beginning episodes in with one of the newer episodes!! Curse them!In the first episode:Sakura is sick. And with her friends to help her must capture the Cloud card.In the second episode:The Silent card got into a painting and ruined it. Sakura must capture it.In the third episode:Kero and Yue talk about things that happened in the past. This is the episode where Eriol{Eli} and his two guardians make an appearence.
5,My Mom LOVED This Book,"I gave this book to my mom this mothers day (2002). She received it early because I'm up at school and when she got the package early she just decided to open it up. As soon as she got it she gave me a call to let me know how much she loves it. She keeps it next to the sofa so she can read it every day. She also told one of her friends about it at work ( who isn't even a mother but loves animals) and her friend wanted to see it. When my mom brought it in to work , her friend started crying because the words are so sweet. I didn't get to look through the entire book since I ordered it online but I'm sure glad that I picked it out. I gurantee that your mom will love this book if they are sentimental and love animals!"
3,great potos but not great text,"The text assumes certain things about the mother-child relationship. Things like assuming you look alike, have the same nose, etc. My mom and I and my son and I have lots in common, but not in the looks department. There are other such assumptions throughout the book that make it seem a phony gift for me to give my mother, since it clearly could never really apply to us. If the text were more general, it would apply to more mom-child relationships. I recommend reading it cover to cover (there are not many pages) before purchasing, just to be sure it's an accurate description of the relationship."
5,great gift,"This book is one of the best Mother's Day gifts I've ever given my Mom. She opened it to take a look & ended up reading the whole thing right there. The animal photography is a wonderful counterpoint to the brief text at the bottom of each page, and she absolutely loved it! Even my Dad really enjoyed it -- speaking of which, when do we get the Dad's thank you book?! Only a few weeks til that gift and I don't think I can top it after this book, unless Bradley Trevor Greive writes one for Dads and quick!!!"
2,"nice, but not very fitting","While the pictures were kind of cute and the message endearing, there were many parts of it that did not really realte to my relationship with my mother. Some parts are too specific to the author's relationship with his mother so that it may not make sense if you were to give it to your mother."
2,Give me a break,"This book is filled with silly photographs, many of which are degrading to the dignity of animals, with a line or two on each page about ""the greatness of being a mom"" from a male author who isn't even a parent??!! Give me a break. I'm returning this."
1,Insulting to animals,"This book, like all of this author's books, contain many photographs that insult the incredible dignity of animals. How arrogant of a man to claim that he loves animals so much but then sell books filled with ridiculous, comic-like photos of animals, just to make himself wealthy and famous. Not only is this book insulting to animals, it's insulting to the intelligence of the reader. Very childish."
4,Beautiful book for moms,"This is a great little book for moms. All of the moms in my family (grandmas, aunts, etc) have really enjoyed reading it and enjoying the cute and funny photos as well. Touching, sweet and light. Also, for a great gift book of wisdom, all the moms in my family absolutely love ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold. Excellent."
5,Fast shipping; seamless transaction,This was a very smooth transaction with fast shipping; I received the book in no time at all and in excellent condition.
2,M3 for getting around.,"I have owned the Garmin M3 for about a year. The first thing I did was to update the software to version 2.5. As far as software goes I have no complaints however be aware that Garmin has limited a lot of nice features that I wish I had. For example don't pre-plan a trip and expect to download it to the M3 and if you want to stay clear of dirt roads good luck there is no filter for dirt roads on the M3.Now, I think the hardware is a good value and maybe it could be used with another map program, but I wish I would have spent a little more and saved my frustrations for something else."
5,"Mad Brilliant isn't, but still shines","I originally bought this album as an investment, but soon warmed up to it. It is far from musically perfect, many notes were off key and melodies were predictable. However, I found it grew on me. It brought back memories of bands in garages performing for the kids in the neighborhood (yes, I grew up in the 60's).The lyrics are not sophisticated, but charming.If you can afford this CD, buy it. Let it take you over."
5,A Song For EVERY Mood,"Ghost of the Robot is a very unique group.They have a great sound and can sing things that will break your heart or amuse you.Most of you will only find out about them because of James, no worries.... stay and become a GOTR Fan :)Catch them live if you can."
2,Blaxploitation at its finest!,"Only enjoyable if you like Blaxploitation movies from the seventies. I purchased this collection for my husband being that he has told me for almost thirty years about the movies that he used to go see as a kid. Well, now that I've seen them, I can understand why they may have a cult following. However, if you are looking for Academy Award performances, look elsewhere. Even if you're looking for a story line...look elsewhere. Rudy Ray Moore, may he rest in peace, still has a following till this day. This movie definitely started....something. My two stars are for effort!"
3,Just Old Classics,"If you've ever watched MAD TV, they do some spoofs off of this series, which include many of the ""problems"" named in some of the above reviews.The skit has horrible acting, silly rhymes, stupid villains, an unsteady camera, and just overall... heh, you get the point. Collector shows such as these sometimes get their ""fame"" on these grounds.I cannot exactly recommend this, though =)"
5,worth it,it was good..it came on time...and my friend loved it. picture quality was good..there were no scratches or any other damages..it arrived safely....
3,Good for beginners...,"The lenses are good quality lenses but the zoom has to be almost fully extended to eliminate the sides of the tube adapter from showing. Also, if the zoom is fully extended on the tele 2x zoom lens, it will create a blurred picture. The last con is that the tube lens adapter DOES NOT come with this combo as stated so you will have to purchase it elsewhere. The filters are great and the tripod was a good value."
5,Best lubricant ever!,"By far the best product on the market. Just don't use too much at once, it can become too slippery. And yes it even tastes ok!"
2,Very thick,"The Astroglide gel is very thick compared to the Astroglide liquid that we've used in the past. I bought it because I thought I'd try something new and the gel idea appealed to me because sometimes some of the liquid gets lost or spilled between dispensing onto the hand and traveling to the target area, or simply drips off or spreads too far after application. The gel seemed like it would be a little more controlled product with less cleanup afterward.After one use I would say the gel is too thick for manual stimulation where a silky smoothness is desired. Instead of creating a slippery effect, there was a feeling of the thickness and almost tackiness of the gel. This might be OK for use with toys or other activities, but it was just too thick to achieve the right gentle touch during manual stimulation that we desired.Also, cleanup afterward required a little more water and a few more wipes due to the thickness of the coating."
3,Not my favorite,"I'm new to the gel consistent lubes and I find this lube to be okay. I am a fan of the regular liquid Astroglide lube and thought that a thicker version would be better for anal play and that it would last longer. I do not find that to be the case with this. It works, just not the way I personally want it to. As with any product, to each his own. You''ll never know until you try for yourself."
4,"Great product, wasteful Amazon packaging","Great product, I just wish the Amazon packaging weren't so wasteful and hadn't almost defeated the purpose of buying an environment-friendly product. Folks, this is paper towels - they ain't gonna break - there's really no need for this much packaging material."
5,Love it!!,"this is the most funniest movie ive ever seen, although its back in the days i still enjoyed it. ive ordered 4 of dolemite movies so far, and i will be getting more."
5,A Magical Masterpiece,"Tom Barron has done it again with his captivating conclusion to the Merlin series. The final book is magical and enthralling as is the series as a whole. I loved the book and have shared it with several friends and family members, all of which enjoyed it as much as I. The incredible adventures of Merlin, coupled with the amazing character imagery portrayed in Barron's story leaves you yearning for the story to continue. Barron spins his tale with a new twist on the classic character of Merlin, showing the lost years of his youth throughout The Lost Years Of Merlin series, and this book, The Wings Of Merlin, finished the series with a tragic and beautiful story of love, hate, retribution, and forgiveness. This is a book that will be hard to put down, and with the conclusion and closing of the amazing series, Barron finds his place among the literary greats of both fantasy writing and literature as a whole. Two thumbs up"
4,The Wings of Merlin,"I read The Wings of Merlin, by T.A.Barron. This is a fantasy book, fourth and last book of the Lost Years of Merlin series.This book talks of Merlin's life on the island of Fincayra before he goes to England to serve King Arthur. Fincayra is an island in between the human world and the otherworld. Merlin and his friends are warned by the Great Spirit, Dagda, that Fincayra and the otherworld will come perilously close on the longest night of the year. At that moment, a spirit army will try to overtake Fincayra. Merlin's task is to reunite the separated peoples of Fincayra so that they may form an army to defend their homeland.This book was a very good ending to the Lost Years of Merlin series. People who like fantasy and are interested in the legend of King Arthur should read it."
5,The Final Frontier,"The Wings of Merlin, the 5th and final installment in the Lost Years of Merlin Series, is fantastic. The imagery and emotion that the author is able to convey throughout this book, and all of the books for that matter, is simply amazing. In this book Merlin has to conquer his nemesis, Rhita Gawr, or suffer the destruction of his beloved homeland of Fincayra. But the only way to do this is to unite the people of his land who have been at each other for centuries. The mystery of the lost wings is revealed, and his destiny is chosen. T.A. Barron has done well with this last book. A great series for any fantasy lover."
5,As good as the others if not better!,"Barron has added a great inclusion not only to the series but to the life of the legendary Merlin...Though it wasn't the best in the series it was still a marvolous book. Like the book's predacessor's I couldn't put it down, from its mysterious beginning to its triumphant end the book is wonderful. My only regret was that it ended, but since it had to it ended as wonderfully as it could have. The final battle lifted my spirits like no other book has done; it combined aspects of all four of the other books and the outcome was fantastic.In the final chapter (I won't spoil it by telling you the details) I couldn't help but feel saddened but like everything an end must come eventually.I encourage you to read the dramatic conclusion to the series but not before you've read its predacessors.May the Force be with you..."
5,Wings of Merlin review,"It allways stayed on the point.There wasn't any skipping around. The characters didn't just say they wanted to go some where and where there. T.A.Barron told how they got there. The book is about Merlin,how he got to the Forgotten island ,the battle to save Finkayra and how he saved the forgotten wings. A old rivel who goes by Slayer, who is out to kill Merlin. And he can back fire Merlins magic. If Merlin turns into deer so does Slayer. Merlins father Stangmar who escaped from his dungen in the hills. And is after Merlins mother Elane. evil Rhita Gwar the war lord god. who is trying to attack Finkayra with a army of spirets. The Wings of Fincayra and the story of thier banashment. and its know longer forgoten aperence. This is a compelling novel in the lost years of Merlin eppic. It is about hate and fear, joy and piece, good and evil but most of all love and self sacrifice."
3,A Good Adventure Story,"I can't help but feel that this book is lacking in complexity. For me, the characters are generally shallow and the conflicts are fairly simple. While I enjoy the classic ""good versus evil"" story, I would like more depth. The simplicity of the conflict and strong emotional reactions of the characters cause this book to be almost melodramatic, and sometimes the courses of action Merlin takes simply don't make sense.Despite the flaws, I still enjoyed this story. It has good lessons to teach, and a creative and somewhat entertaining story line. If you are a fan of Merlin, TA Barron, I would definitely recommend it. If not, it's a decent read, just not the best."
4,The book provides very helpful tips and reminders.,"A good quick read with helpful illustrations. The book consists of fundamental suggestions on how to improve specific shots when problems arise. I skimmed back over this short book during my busride to our hometown golf course...armed with this knowledge, my golf clubs and my seasonal bus-pass I was confident that at the end of the day my score would put me in the drivers seat ""so to speak"" in our foursome. Sure enough it did---I ended up over the last ten holes shooting one over par, having the longest drive in our group and also closest to the pin. It mainly talks about squaring the clubface and slices and your backswing. Do not let the date of original publication concern you."
2,"Disc was defective - right at the end, too!!!",Everything went fine until the climactic scene at the end...and then the DVD crapped out and was unwatchable. Further inspection revealed damage that could not be fixed. This was purchased NEW from Amazon and is the Reel Enterprises 2006 production. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!
2,Charade - Synergy Archive Series,"I was excited to finally own Charade. It is one of my more favorite movies. The plot is fantastic, and the actors supreme. I was, however, disappointed with this copy. The audio was terrible, the picture quality was awful; and on more than one occasion the screen jumped, missing some part of the movie. It was usually inconsequential stuff, like a door closing or a match striking. This particular DVD copy is not worth the plastic it is packaged in. Pass this copy by, there are other, better copies here on Amazon."
2,"Good Movie, Poor Quality","The DVD transfer of this movie is bad. Very frequently throughout the film the screen goes blank for a fraction of a second. It was annoying but the film itself is very good. If I could find a better quality version of this film, I'd get it."
1,Amazon you have let us down!,I cannot believe that Amazon has allowed this product to be sold by them. For a top quality company this is a bottom quality product. See other comments from unhappy customers. DO NOT BUY!
1,horrible quality!!,Don't buy! Wish I would of seen a review of this particular sellers copy before purchasing! Amazon needs to pull it off the shelf!
1,Charade,We have purchased many DVDs from Amazon and the quality of this DVD was the worse of any DVD I have ever purchased from anyone. The quality was so bad we could not finish watching the DVD. We have ordered another copy on Charade...The remastered copy. Charade is an outstanding movie.
1,This copy of Charade sucks,"Hello everyone,Save your money! Do not buy this copy of Charade; it's terrible. There are lines through the screen and it is worse than a copy of a movie you would see from the 60's. This particular copy of Charade is a waste of money!"
1,Pirated Copy!,"I purchased this item for my daughter's birthday. Unfortunately, by the time she opened it to watch it, the return window was closed. This is a PIRATED copy!! And it was poorly pirated at that! The faces were grainy and the entire film quality was very poor. She could not watch it. We had to just throw it away. The DVD case should have been our first clue...upon closer examination, it was obviously a copy of the original case. I wanted to rate this zero stars, but this system requires I give at least one star."
1,Choppy and poor quality,"I was so thrilled to get this movie in the mail. But unfortunately, once I put it in the DVD player to watch, I immediately noticed that the image kept catching. The sound was on, but the image was fuzzy and made me dizzy to look at it. I will be returning and reordering a much better copy."
1,Don't buy this version,I bought two copies of this video and they were both returned as unviewable. They were the worst DVD's I have ever seen. They would strta and stop and ther was no way to view the movie. I splurged for the Criterion version and it is perfect.The maker of these DVD's should be banned from Amazon as he give them a really BAD NAME!!!
1,Should have read the reviews before buying!,"I did not look closely at what I was buying before I got this particular copy of the movie (which I love) but I have never seen such a poor quality recording in my life. Pops & flashes, floating vertical lines, green circles appearing randomly and skips in video AND audio make this extremely disappointing. (I would have been better off to make my own DVD-R from my old worn out VHS copy!) You get what you pay for -I will be getting the Criterion Collection copy and throwing this one away as a loss!"
1,Poor DVD Quality,"The quality of this DVD is very poor. I don't know who produces these DVDs but they clearly don't know what they are doing,or they don't care. The film Charade was in letterbox format. Above the letterbox, ran a series of black and white squigglely lines. They were throughout the film. It was extremely annoying and ruined watching the film. Charade is one of my favorite films; it's also one that you have to watch closely because there are so many twists and turns in the plot. I finally took a towel and laid it over the top of the TV to cover up the black and white squiggles. Then I could finally focus on the film. But I shouldn't have to do that!"
1,the quality of the cd was awful.,"charade is a fun movie, but the quality of the cd itself (which was the replacement for the first cd I returned), was unacceptable."
1,Marginal at Best,"Unfortunately, the content is rambling with arguments poorly constructed, or not supported at all. I would suggest finding alternate reading if you have questions about apologetics."
1,Don't Bother,"The author seems to have a poor command of the English language. The book reads like a self published work. I found the theology weak. However, I must confess that I would not make it past the first chapter before giving up."
1,Booorrrrrrrring - a waste of paper,"Very disappointing, and remarkably uninteresting. I had expected the book to be a full biography, but it turns out to be a diary of one season's (2001) racing. Not much nitty-gritty stuff for the dedicated race fan (although there is an interesting comparison of English and Japanese Dunlops), more of a ""I got up this morning, and then I ate muesli for breakfast ,and then ... "" blah, blah, blah.Verdict : for the committed Hodgson fan only, unless you absolutely must have everything ever written on superbike racing. Sad to think some poor tree has given it's all so this could be printed."
1,Philips Flat Panel scam,"I purchased the Philips 32"" flat panel LCD-TV expecting the latest in technology. One of the features highlighted in the ad is the use of a new backlighting unit using HCFL (hot cathode fluorscent lamps) instead of the old style CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamps). I am a technical kind of guy and a tinkerer. Little did I know that my curiosity would reveal some false advertising. The Philips set did not have the HCFL system, but had the old CCFLs. I have pictures to prove this.I intend to take this up with Amazon and see what they say about it. This makes me suspect of other Philips products. Hopefully, they will pull this and the rest of the Philips stuff off their website."
2,Faded Aristocracy,"Burke's Landed Gentry is not what is used to be! The new volume on the Ridings of York shares information on the lineage of the old landed families with details of the nouveau riche of the county - or the ""meritocracy"" as the publisher labels them. As such is a hybrid between the old ""Landed Gentry"" and ""Who's Who in Business"". Doubtless, more copies are sold to members of the second category than those of the first."
3,Okay for Forced Reading,"I had to read this for a college class. It's rather painful, but by college class standards, it's actually not that bad. I wouldn't say the author's style is exactly riveting, but it's a doable read. Chapter lengths are reasonable.I wouldn't exactly wait up at midnight for this, but if you have to read it, just remember, it could be worse... a lot worse."
3,Needs some design work,"Bought this product to replace ""brass"" manifold that was not doing well with mineralized water. This plastic manifold could be more serviceable if the plastic were of a harder material. One cross threading will end its usefulness."
1,Nice design but died after 20 months,"Purchased in July 2010, dead by April 2012.... developed holes in the plastic. Am totally mystified why there are so many unreliable water manifolds out there. Have gone through about 6 of them in the past 10 years."
5,An All-Round Pleaser,"I have always loved the music from Sesame Street, and as I have gotten older I have found that the next generation loves it just as much as I have, whether it be the older or newer songs. Since I bought this album, I have had it regularly playing at my sons' request. Funnily enough, anyone who walks in to our house smiles when they hear the music, ask what the album is, then sit back and enjoy it all - regardless of whether they have ever watched Sesame Street or not. Furry and real voices have universal appeal whatever the age of the listener! A beautiful album."
4,Come and Play,"WHAT???????No Capital I!!!! I can't believe that ""Capital I"" is not on this CD. Boy, I guess they should do two versions: Songs from the Street 60's/70's and songs from the street 80's 90's.Still a Great CD though."
2,35 Years and a lot of missing memories...,"Anxiously awaiting this box set, I was thoroughly disappointed when I found there were so, so many songs left out. There are so many songs from ""today's Sesame"" - what happened to the songs of Sesame from years ago? I was expecting to see more of the classic, unavailable songs from my record collection, but sadly, they can't be found on this box set. Disc 3 is a disappointment - who wants to hear another Aerosmith song???!! Not me. Give me the Ernie & Bert Rhyming song and you would have made my day. Sorry, I have to give it 2 stars. Most of these songs are available on all their other CDs. Shame on you Sesame Street! This box set is just as lame as Season 35."
3,Good but could be better,"I had this little Grizzly H3140 1 x 30"" belt sander for just over a month now. I had a chance to give it a good work out. It serves it's purpose and for the price can't complain too much. The big problem is (and I know it is design and can not be resolved) is the crown in the drive wheels. it puts a bow in the belt so there is no way of getting a nice flat sanding surface with light pressure. The belt has even cut a ""U"" shape into the table top. It will stall if you try and get aggressive. In fact when I put on a new belt it barley had the power to run it because it was so tight. After it ran a bit and the belt stretched out it was fine. It is certainly not a precision sander and if you think you can get nice small precise sanding this is not for you. It is a great little sander for small stuff too small for the bench top. It is stable and will sit any ware with out fastening it down."
3,"Grizzly H3140 Belt Sander 1""x30"" Review","They unit does its job at an economical price.The workmanship of its construction definitelytells us its 'Made in China'.Aligning the support table is difficult, butthe job of this device, is, after all, not tolet you perform stereotaxic brain surgery! Itssaving grace is that it makes the belt moveand its simple. Adjusting lateral travel of the belt is difficult ..This isnot suited to any commercial application that i can imagine. Thirty-inch belts can be found (Jantz, eg.). It's well-suited forknife-sharpening but do get at least 400gritbelts for that, and you shouldnt use thesupport table for that .. Do it freehand, seeing that the belt rotates downward.Final impression: It works, at a good price, simply-made, so i do endorse the device for home use."
3,Kevin from PA,"First of all, this sander does not come with a nice shiny black metal motor as seen in picture, instead black plastic.It is very light and portable. The problem is you can not sand a true 90o angle no matter how much you adjust the table and belt back support. Motor bogs down very easily.I'll probably give to my neighbor.If any one has found a 1"" belt sanders that sands a true 90o angle sander please tell me make and model."
4,grate buy.,"it's money will spent.i like it because of it's size. it will fit anywhere,when there not much room to work. i even took it to the shop and ues it. and it's grate for hobbies too.i build boats & cars. ....not very good at this, if you would like to call i can answer better over the phone,"
3,Gool little machine,"I have purchased two of these sanders over the last five years. They are very useful for a variety of wood and metal projects. Once you put one on your work bench you will be surprised how frequently you use it. I burned out the motor on my first unit, however I was shaping boat parts out of some fairly hard mahogany. If they made a heavy duty model I would be willing to pay more for it."
4,"indispensible little chair, shoulder straps would have made this better","We saw this chair at a friend's house and I immediately came home and ordered it. Amazon had it back ordered for 3 months, then told me they couldn't get the red one at all, and I didn't want the other colors. I finally got it from Walmart.com.Anyway, about the chair, it is fabulous. Our 9 month old son has completely abandoned his high chair. We have this chair cliped on the kitchen counter all the time. He watches us cook and he eats in this chair. The best use of this chair is going to restaurants. He is still not sitting so well unassisted. But this chair makes him feel comfortable in strange surroundings.Cons: shoulder straps would have made this chair so much better. Our son pushes his feet on the kitchen counter and arches his back when he is tired of sitting in this chair. This is really dangerous as he is then hanging over the back of the chair, so we never let him sit in this chair without someone next to him."
5,"Great music, good CD","It is a pity that this music is not more often played in concerts (at least here in Spain) and recorded. Dukas had a great talent as an orchestral composer, and personally I think that The sorcerer's apprentice is a fascinating work. La Péri is also a very fine ballet music, which sometimes makes you remember Debussy or Ravel. The Symphony is perhaps a bit too long, but contains some wonderful moments. As far as the performance is concerned, I haven't heard any other, so I cannot compare, but in general I think it's very good. To sum up, I would say that this CD is a very good opportunity to get to know a bit of Dukas' music, which I think it's very worth the effort. Definitely recommended."
1,"Not a ""good"" book","Sorry, but I disagree with all the ""good"" reviews here. I made the mistake of reading them, then ordering the book. It is not worth the money, nor the time it takes to look at it.The pictures all look like they are from a 1940's high school shop manual. Pictures lack detail and are blurry.Descriptions of accessories are lacking in detail and don't seem to note ""how to make"" any of them.My suggestion is to look elsewhere for ""table saw techniques"" rather than buy this book.Sorry I didn't do so."
2,Buyer beware...,"I purchased this book and wish I had not. (Revised edition (c) 1997) It contains the most basic information which might be ok for a beginner but it is coupled with poor photographs and confusing (wrong?) information (i.e. The Taper Jig Text on pg 224 says ""Measure back from hinge exactly 1-foot"" yet the line illustration on Pg 222 clearly show's the 12inch measure from the Taper foot - the two directions are contradictory). The line drawings were helpful and pretty clear but as mentioned above I question their accuracy. I am not an expert and I did get a few bits of information from this book but nothing you could not find on the WWW."
1,Errors in abundance,"I just finished reading about half of this book. The writing is so repetitious and boring I couldn't finish it. As background, I have done woodowrking for more than 20 years, both as a hobby and professionally. This book has more errors than any book I've read in both the text and the photo captions. It is also limited in it's coverage of jigs , etc. If you want a book on table saw usage buy something else."
4,Book,I wish I had this book a lot of years ago. It would have saved me some money and a lot of grief. I am giving it 4 stars rather than 5 as I knew a lot of the content through trial and error. Lewis891
2,internet more useful,"go read stuff from the web. this book is very basic and not better than stuff that can be found for free. it is, however, less prone to dust and impact damage than a laptop... equally prone to water damage."
5,This is a Great Series!,"I can't wait to see what will happen next. Great series, it's original. Love me some Jax!!!"
5,never dull,"This is my first movie purchase online but I figured for that competitive price, who could resist. I am so glad I did. This is a show I can watch over and over and each time pick something up that I missed from the time before. I can't wait to get season three."
5,Great series!,Lots of twists & turns...suspence and drama...can it get any better? Season 2 delivers detailed drama of the motorcycle club. Can't wait to see the next season! :o)
3,WHY NO HD DOWNLOAD FOR TIVO?!,"yes, believe it or not there's no HD download for my HD tivo! what's the deal?!granted the quality when i click 'zoom' is about on par with FX HD on cable when watching on my 32"".so far the first episode of season 2 keeps up the awesome of season 1."
1,didn't receive,I'm sure I would love this dvd if I had ever gotton it. Amazon was great and refunded me. I have since reordered the dvd series.
1,sons of anarchy,zone 1 : unable to see it anywhere on my 5 dvd players at home. there should a warning for that. Ripp off
3,Sons of Anarchy season 2 DVD,"Unfortunately, the last disc in the case was scratched and unable to play on either of my DVD players. A bit disappointing."
3,The series is great. Amazon's connection is NOT.,The series is fantastic - however the connection with Amazon Prime leaves a LOT to be desired. Their server just doesn't deliver enough bandwidth. I have a very fast internet connection and the best router money can buy and I still can't get a good connection. I have recently switched to Netflix and find it to be very superior in all respects.
5,Perfect Condition/Came Fast,"It came a week earlier than I expected, and it was packaged great. The disks and case were in perfect condition a great show to watch with teh family... without kids of course. lol"
5,Season 2 SOA,"Love it, love it, love it. That's all I can say. I have watched this dvd a million times, or at least it seems like it."
5,Whats not to love,"Just began watching season one, if this one is as good as the first then I am not going to be disappointed."
2,Not as good as the hype,"There is just too much drama, side deals, back deals, back stabbings, secrets being kept and plot twists upon plot twists. The writers must feel that if they don't have at least a dozen plot twists for every episode then they haven't done their job. The show is very frustrating to follow."
5,sons of anarchy 2,"The product arrived on time, the disks were in excellent condition. I would recommend this product to all my friends and family."
5,Love this series.,"This is an exciting ""edge of your seat"" series. Continually has ""couldn't see that coming"" events occurring. Can't wait for the next season to begin."
5,Best Show Ever,"This is the best show on TV. The actors are great and the story line is riviting. I love Ron Perlman and Katey Segal...........Who would have thought she had it in her. I cant wait for season 2 to come out of DVD. The sons may seem like bad guys, and I guess they are to some extent, but I would rather live next door to Clay, Jax and the crew than Tony Soprano."
3,only half as good as season one.....,"just finished watching the UK version..... still good acting and lots of action,but the story is full of big holes and the ending is very weak......very disappointing after a great season one!"
3,s o a,i really like the seriesnot many biker type shows on any moreIf you start watching its addictingIt is what it isHERB
3,Interesting,"The show is great but this review is for the 'Casting Session' alone. As the title for this review says, it is interesting. A real fan of any show always wants more information about the show. It would have been allot better if the casting details would have been extended to the rest of the crew (Bobby, Tig, Chibbs, Juice, Opie, Piney & even the prospect Half Sack), main girlfriends(Tara & Luanne), the Charming PD (Chief Unser & Deputy Chief Hale) and ATF (Agent Stahl). This only focuses on the 3 main characters of Jax Teller, Clay Morrow, and Jemma Teller. This 9 minute clip is free so why wouldn't any fan of ""Sons Of Anarchy"" download it real quick and learn behind the scenes knowledge of how the 3 main characters were casted?"
5,Great Buy!,This season was perfectly new and wrapped!!! So glad I bought the blue ray dvd set on amazon through this buyer!
5,Love,Absolutely love this show. Can't wait until next season. Viewed the season in two nights liked it so muchHave now order the rest of the seasons. Great without commercials.
5,Just gets better and better,"I just started watching this series and now I can't stop. The story line is fast paced, characters are excellent!"
5,new dvd's,"i was weiry about buying from others on the internet, even new items, but the dvd's arrived early and in orginal packaging....thank you for a good experience."
5,Great show,Great show can't wait for season 5 to be free on video on demand. Love Jack! Love the story lines.
1,Disc froze,Disc wouldn't play. Kept skipping. Waiste of moneyProduct unacceptable.Should have purchased this product in a place that would accept returns
4,Great series!,One of the DVD's had a slight scratch that effected how the video played for a few seconds but otherwise no problems!
5,Sons of Anarchy,Great product at a low low price. 1/2 the price as Best Buy. Very please and will order from them again.
2,First dvd,First dvd was completely blank - the rest were fine. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. I was disappointed that it was defective.
2,Disappointing,Seems like the second season of a lot of my favorite shows are a let down. The first 5 episodes should have been renamed from Sons of Anarchy to 'Gemma Teller deals with getting attacked'. The show starts to feel like a lifetime movie at points. There's some good points but this and the ridiculously contrived way the season ends really bought it down from a great first season.
5,Addictive,I bought this and season one and season three for Christmas gift for my daughter and she LOVES them all!
5,Awesome,"This is an awesome series, recomended it to anyone that likes sex, drugs, and guns. Oh and lets not forget about the bad a_ _ bikes."
3,Sub Par,"It's surprising how such a promising show could deteriorate so quickly. It's clear that the writer tried to take it up a notch in the second season, but while the storyline may have been more exciting, the way it was told was not. Plenty of unnecessary dialogue (why do writers assume we're idiots and need everything explained to us?), soap opera drama, and a cheesy, improbable finale presented merely to enhance a 'cliff ender' and ensure an audience for Season 3. It all comes across as selfish and lazy to me, which is very disappointing."
5,Great movie,The item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly. I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend it to you.
3,"Love Sons, however.","I love Sons of Anarchy, however the 3rd and 4th discs tended to skip or freeze, which made it difficult to watch. Since I didn't watch them until a couple of months after I purchased them I didn't think I could send them back."
5,sons of anarchy all seasons,"i think that all of the seasons are great.i can't stop watching them. it's like a soap opera, you can't wait to see the next turn in events."
2,I'm jumping off a sinking bike after 2 seasons...,"Far from classic and far from must see... Firstly, production values..Cheesy comes to mind... Dialogue and acting are both overblown andFull of testosterone induced comatose... Sopranos destroys SOA. DeadwoodDestroys SOA... Carnivale, etc... This show fails to show realism and willconstantly insult those with above average intelligence... It's basicallya soap opera for men who think they are ""real men""... I tried.... Wanted tolike the show but its bogged down by its own false sense of realism. Just wasn'ta favorite of mine."
5,Awesome Possum!,It only took 2 and a half days and my dvd was brand new! I will definitely be buying again from you guys... Thank you SOOO much for excellent everything!
5,On par with Season 1,"If you're looking at season 2 of SOA, then you probably loved season 1. This is no let-down... exciting, visually and through the storyline. Great cliff hanger season ending."
1,great product crap service,this is a great product however amazons ability to suppy a set of 2 as stated well just doesnt happen anyone in australia wishing to purchase these pruducts should contact hafele ar lincoln century it might be a little more expensive but at least you will get what you paid for.
1,Short changed,"Twice I ordered this (FastCap Little Hand HD 3rd Hand Support System 16.5 in. to 22.8 in. 2-pack) two pack item and only received one item each time instead of two. Ordering twice should have given you ample opportunities to get it right. Sorry about the poor review, but I really tried to get these items. It also took several phone calls in order to get the money refunded the second time I returned the item."
3,baby shoes,"These shoes look great, even my husband said ""Ooo, if they sell it for for men, can you buy them for me?"" My baby wearing size 3,5 now, I bought size 5 for next 2009 summer at Kohls for 15$ on sale. Unfortunately, these shoes have only one strap on the top,(many shoes for children have two), and even when I opened this one strap and tried to put it on my baby's foot,I was pushing hard and I tried to make the opening wider, but I just couldn't put it on my baby's foot, so I had to return these back. If only it had to strars on the top....I would keep it...."
3,Hummel Jersey,"Great looking jersey. However, the neck is tight on the v-neck and the material around the neck is scratchy...also, the chevrons on the sleeves and the chest are made of some sort of plastic material that has a tendency to warp when in the dryer....this warping comes out after wearing the shirt for a while but may annoy some people until it does. This shirt runs true to size and will not shrink in the wash.hummel Squadra Soccer Jersey (Wh/Bk)"
4,"Poetry that ""shows me.""","I discovered this book in my school library as a teenager in the 80s. For me, it was a wonderful introduction to the simplicity that poetry can be.While studying poetry in college, I had a professor that repeatedly challenged us to, ""Show me, don't tell me"" regarding the language we used in our poems. He wanted us to understand that poetry should invoke images in the reader's mind rather than provide a detailed account of what the reader should see.For me, Victoria Forrester does that.The reader must remember that these poems, although considered ""modern,"" were written before the age of the Internet, September 11 and so many of the other things that shape our current world. The themes of the poems are so much more innocent than they would be if written today. And for that very reason, I return to them when I need a retreat.Like Dickenson? Yes. But not a copy. I treasure this book and its simple illustrations."
1,Basically a Piece of Crap,"These lights are basically crap. When I first got them (I bought 3 because I knew they weren't very reliable), one of them didn't work. About a week later, a second one stopped working. I figured out how to get the two of them working, but after another week or two, one stopped working again (no idea if it was one of the first two duds or the one that had been working fine up until then). I had two non-working lights from before this order; I was able to get one of them to start working by twiddling some of the metal parts inside; the other one may have had dead batteries. In short, they *may* work for a while, but don't count on it!!"
3,There's a better way to own this film,"This is a great film if you are a fan of precodes and of Joan Blondell's saucy ways. Sure, it's not ""Gold Diggers of 1933"", nor is it as good as any of the precodes Joan Blondell made with James Cagney, but it is enjoyable viewing if you like that type of film. I do have to agree with the reviewer that said the print looks bad. It appears not to have been touched up at all - just another unrestored copy of this public domain film. The more cost-effective way to own this film is to purchaseComedy Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection. It has this film and 49 other films for not much more than you pay for this one film.Film entertainment value: 4/5 stars for fans of precodesAudio/video quality: 2.5/5 starsAverage: 3 stars"
3,Pre-code spice and Joan Blondell,This pre-code teaser on DVD has some titilating scenes but the transfer process is truly bad. The film is now 75+ years old and it shows. The image quality hasn't improved since I bought this public domain film on VHS some 25 years ago. I doubt anyone will spend the time or money to try and restore it. Recommended for Joan Blondell fans and pre-code fans only.
1,Barely a talkie,"This is an extremely weak film from 1932 presented in a lousy print. The production and the acting are so crude, that one would think that this came from 1929 or 1930. The story is a familiar one: gold-digging girls. Audiences were supposed to be titillated by the sight of ladies in underwear, plus all the drinking, smoking, and conniving. The movie may be of interest to film students, and even Joan Blondell freaks. But it's a solid loser, and certainly not worth the $9.95 price. I'm not reselling my copy; I'm tossing it."
2,Bland and introspective,"I was hoping for an exciting story or at least some hot scenes, but was disappointed. The story flows well enough that I stuck out the whole book. It does lend some interesting insights into the S/M scene which could serve as an introduction to this genre. The writing is a little better than some other books in this category, but it is still not up to the standards of trade fiction."
4,Evgeny Kissin at his best: Live!,"This is definitely one of the best live recordings of the young Kissin to date. Kissin begins the recital with Rachmaninoff's beautiful ""Lilacs"" which to my mind is a far better interpretation than the composer himself! He then attacks the two technically difficult ""Etude Tableaus"" with such ease. Prokofiev's war sonata no.6 is brilliantly played by the young virtuoso. However, Kissin outshines his predecessors with an amazing performance of Liszt's two concert etudes. But wait, there's more...Kissin's superior interpretation of Scriabin's fiendishly technically demanding C#-minor etude is simply AMAZING! This is probably the best recording of this etude to date. I would've given 5 stars for this CD, but unfortunately, I didn't care too much for Kissin's immature interpretation of Chopin's Polonaise in F#-minor, op.44. Regardless, I would highly recommend any music lover to get this CD now, it's incredible!"
4,"Different, but well worth buying","I think The Waiting is one of the best bands around, Christian or secular. Unfazed is great music though it is different than their other two albums. This album grows on you."
5,I Waited and I Love it!,"After buying their self-titled CD, I couldn't wait for their next CD (excluding Blue Belly Skies that had only a few new recordings). Unfazed is original and sends a powerful message."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"I am a huge fan of The Waiting; however, this effort was simply disappointing. There is nothing new here. The band definitely needs to grow to stay interesting. Of particular concern was the refrains. The Olsen's work the guitar-vocals very well on the verses but the refrains do not seem to fit with the verses. Examples include the annoying Disappear and All Together."
3,"Decent story, OK acting","The story's decent, but could be better told. The main character's, Akihito Yagi (as Giryu), acting is a bit rough, but I liked the performance of Tatsuya Naka (as Taikan)."
3,3/5,"Would have been a great movie but the final fight scene ended up being a let-down and plain stupid. Also, the ""slow"" character I just didn't feel enough empathy for. The actor who portrayed him just didn't show enough emotion so that you could understand/feel what he was thinking."
5,Wonderful Book,"This is a beautiful book, it is well written and extremely accurate. The book tells a story about a young girl who wants to send her father a birthday card. Her father works as a sailor aboard a Great Lakes freighter and she is happy to learn that a boat in Detroit, Michigan delivers U.S. Mail to all ships passing Detroit. She sends his card and he receives it a few days later when his ship passes Detroit. The illustrations are also wonderfully done and very accurate. What I liked best about the story is that it is educational and emphasizes a strong family bond. I rated this book five stars and have bought several copies as Christmas presents and have donated a copy to my daughters school library."
5,MUST READ!!,"This book is wonderful. Every parent of a child with asthma must read it. I have searched and searched for information this helpful and practical for two years. The book gave me confidence in our Dr. (who is always too busy to give us much information), but also pointed out some areas we need to work on with the Dr. I always question all the medication we give our son. After reading this book, I feel I understand asthma and the current treatment plans."
1,Rubbish,"I originally purchased this movie with the intent of showing my students the horrible nature of Saddam Hussem, and the awful atrocities that he committed against the people of Iraq. On this front, the movie was successful. Unfortunately, it quickly became a film to justify the American government's military actions in Iraq. The producer's argument, and a poor one at that, is that the military invasion into Iraq is indeed right, since Saddam was such a terrible man. For this reason, I will also use this film to reveal to my students the attempt of some real estate guy to promote his propaganda, and right wing agenda of defending Bush's miserable Middle East foreign policy."
5,Tending Wounds and Making Discoveries,"After escaping the castle together, Balsa and Chagum head for Balsa's homeland seeking refuge. The Emperor's elite troops are hot on their trail. The duo is attacked. Balsa is able to fend off the troops, but is severely injured in the process. I can't believe that those men would harm a woman this gorgeous. Chivalry must truly be dead. Anyway, the two are saved by Balsa's old friend who is a healer. While recovering at his house, an old magic user arrives and discovers the truth about Chagum's possessor. After recuperating, they set out again for Balsa's home country.This volume is great. Except for the fact that there are only 3 episodes. The plot thickens and the characters gain more depth. This series is growing on me, and I'm beginning to like it quite a lot. I think that just about any anime lover can find something to like about this series. I highly recommend it. It's very good, and it seems to be getting even better after every episode."
3,Gets too hot to be considered for gaming,"I own two of these which I'm currently using in a SLI configuration (msi nvidia 750i SLI, q6600 2.4GHz, 4GB DDR2) and I can play doom3 with everything maxed out (even AA) and works incredibly smooth for a couple of minutes then the cards turn very hot and are unable to keep a constant framerate. I blame that on the lack of active cooling.I know, these cards offer great value for their price but don't expect any miracles and don't buy them for gaming. If you do at least pick the version with active cooling. Honestly, I bought them to build a quiet PC and made the wrong assumption that buying two for SLI would help me play some games at a decent frame-rate..."
2,Unexpected Novel,It's more of a history book than a novel and it was hard to read. This author received excellent reviews but I didn't find he was as good as the reviews said. I was a little disappointed as it wasn't what I expected.
5,Canada's Greatest living writer,"I've read everything that Alstair MacLeod has ever written,since I first discovered him an an obscure bookstore in Prince Rupert ,B.C. in 1969. He has written wonderful short pieces, but sadly, there isn,t much! He takes a long time to craft his short stories but the end result is the most magnificent use of the English language in decades,with each word just were it needs to be to create perfection.. The ISLAND collection of all his stories is a wonderful gift to American readers from Canada, where serious writing is a serious and nationally appreciated business. MacLeod is at the top of his form here in this collection. Incidentally, his novel,NO GREAT MISCHIEF, will take your breath away. Writing dosen't get any better than this."
3,"some good stories, some not so good","I found this book not that good that 'no great mischief' was and, therefor, I was a bit disappointed. Some short stories were wonderful, some were not that good. Nevertheless, Alistair MacLeod is worth reading!"
1,Misrepresenting the Truth,"One of the great lies existing within Canada is that the corner of the world known as ""Cape Breton"" is a mystical, haunting, culturally rich area. This is a complete falsehood. I lived in CB for over 25 years. It is an impoverished, dirty, run-down hellish little island with extremely high unemployment and alcoholism. The ""culture"" existing, consists of bastardizing the English language and drunken ""fiddlers"" hopping around, believing that they are prodigies. This book, while well written, further perpetuates the myths about this island. That is unfortunate."
4,A Magnificent Work,"MacLeod's stories evoke a sense of place better than most living writers. He does not rend his characters with relentless descriptions of their appearance (in fact, in some of the stories, the characters have no names and we are given little or no hint of what they look like); rather, they seem to emerge from the very landscape the author describes. They are coal miners, fishermen, lighthouse keepers and their wives and children, living in a part of the world that is alternately gorgeous and ferocious. MacLeod recognizes that this is all we need to know of them to understand their lives. What is even more impressive than MacLeod's elegant, understated style is the fact that the stories in Island were published over the course of 30 years, from the late '60s to 1999. Yet the author's voice and the quality of his craftsmanship are so masterful, the span of time between the stories is virtually indiscernible. This is what makes literature classic."
