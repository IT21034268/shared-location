3,Good Book,This is one of the many self help books that have come and gone on the radar screen. Its nice that we can recover some of the good ones and learn something.
5,Fun with a Nun,"RUN FROM THE NUN is a good book. It talks about moving to a different school where you know absolutely no one while at your old school you had a really good friend. Imagine the scenario: your parents move you to a completely different school, a Catholic school, and you are not even moving! Then when you call your best fried, she only talkis about how she and apreppy person are getting to be best firends. So of course Kara REALLY wants to go back to her old school. What happens? Read to find out!"
4,Will her first day at the new school be her last?,"Kara's parents have transferred her to St. Joan of Arc School in the hopes that she will do better in school. Kara doesn't want to change schools and leave her best friend. But as time goes by, she becomes more and more involved with the events that are going on around her. Kara becomes particularly interested in solving the mystery around what is happening in the church cemetary. ""Run from the Nun"" is a mystery book for young readers ages 9 to 12. And when that mystery is solved, the possibility of new mysteries loom on the horizon."
2,Math not up to date,We bought it primarily to get the math cartridge. The menu had the publisher but the book was one edition behind the book my daughter's school uses.
3,Not all that universal,I have a Hp iPaq 111 classic hand held and this stylus does not fit. It's good quality but just don't fit my iPAQ.
1,"Guess what, it's not universal!!!","I guess this is a bad review owing to bad item description, not bat quality. Turns out, it is NOT a universal ipaq stylus set, so make sure your ipaq is combatible!!!"
3,IPAQ211,"PRO: PDA's are a great way of carrying a computer in your pocket. Schedule, contacts, tasks, and notes are at your finger tips anywhere, anytime. HP has a great product. The 211 has a large screen, and very sharp lettering.CON: HP has made a few ""improvement"" since their last equivelent 4700 series model. The screen has an extra plastic protection that floats above the screen. Every touch of the stylus feels mushy compared to the solid touch of their older model. But, you can get use to it.Another ""improvement"": they no longer include a cradle and then change the base connection so older cradles are no longer compatible.Another ""improvement"": now only 3 of the 4 buttons can be programmed by the user.Another software improvement: 'OneNotes' on the laptop is a very useful program. But on the PDA it's dumbdowned a lot."
4,Horace Silver Quintet 1976,"This excellent performance was filmed on July 20, 1976 at the Umbria Jazz Festival. The Quintet features Tom Harrell on trumpet, Bob Berg on tenor saxophone, Steve Beskrone on bass guitar and Eddie Gladden on drums. The group performs four Horace Silver originals in this 50 minute film, the third and fourth pieces being the highlights--In Pursuit of the 27th Man and Song for My Father. On these two songs in particular, the group is in top form (Harrell especially), and the viewer is rewarded with the experience of witnessing the unique way in which Mr. Silver attacks the piano, producing his wonderful and readily identifiable style, as well as hearing his nearly unmatched accompaniment to the other players. A highly recommended DVD."
2,Better to buy locally if possible.,The bottles seal was broken when it arrived. I threw it out and bought a replacement in a local supermarket.
2,A twist: the movie's so much better,"Yeah, usually books are better than the movies, not in this case. I'm almost finished with it and struggling to maintain interest. The dialogue often doesn't ring true, something a writer would write, not something that a person would say. The movie streamlined a complicated plot, and made Bourne's female pal way more believable."
3,Kindle Book,"A little too complicated, but better than the movie. It takes a while to figure out the intrigue. But it is still an interesting read."
4,points out the problems with the film...,"I actually liked the Damon films. However, the original highlights the vague sense of dislocation I felt while watching them.Movie Bourne has no context. Without this slice of Cold War paranoia and national discontent the seventies laid on the landscape the superman spy lacks a purpose other than his current motives. With Vietnam and shots being fired across Checkpoint Charlie Borne makes sense. The nation needed men like him.I'm happy I found the book and the original purpose of Bourne."
4,Finally able to get Bourne series in US Kindle,"Love the books more than the movie. Similar story line, but the differences and details are amazing. Classic Ludum awesomeness."
3,The Bourne Identity,"I love the plot. However, the diaologue is rambling and very repetitive. More cogent and less wordy dialogue would be preferred.I have read other Ludlum books. I think he sould stick to basic writing skills.Respectfully - Henry's Review"
2,Movie's way better....,"I really enjoyed the movies and got them on DVD, after having read the Sigma Protocol by Robert Ludlum I was a little excited to read the book thinking it would be more exciting then the movie.I was wrong, it is slow going, with long periods of in-action, the story reads well and while you feel for Bourne aka Delta, aka Cain, aka Webb... The movie pulls it off much better, by giving you a story that while it is not as complicated, still tells a good story with a meaningful plot. What got me the most was the Totally Anti-Climactic End, that leaves the story Un-finished, I threw the book on the floor after I read the last few pages.Avoid the book unless you have several hours to kill, the DVD tells a much better story."
3,My first Ludlum book,"I bought this book because I enjoyed the Bourne series of movies, but I was surprised to see how far from the book the movies actually are. I found the story a little slow in the begining and it took me some time to adjust to the pace of the book. I like books that are into the action from the start gate. Overall I enjoyed the story and for the sake of curiosity I have decided to read the follow on books too."
2,"For once, the movie was better","After seeing the movie, I was pleased to discover that it was based on a novel by a reputable author. I had already read two Ludlum novels, so I immediately purchased the Bourne Trilogy with high expectations from my other Ludlum experiences.All three books are disappointing both in their numerous plot twists and especially in the character dialogue. The main characters all sound like Mensa-Wannabees with every other line a new metaphor or witty reference. I regret purchasing the trilogy. The first movie is superior in every way."
2,Maybe the book is better,I heard the audio book. Its pretty boring. I hear that the actual book is good. hmm. Maybe i missed something. Ill wait until the movie comes out i think.
1,really really BAD,This book is so contrived. I had just finished reading Ian Fleming. What a world of difference. I got about 100 pages in and couldn't take it any more. The book is written around these far-fetched ideas. It's awkward and the writing style is just plain bad.
3,Boatswain's Mate is better.,I recently read Boatswain's Mate by Pat Johnston and found it to be more interesting than The Bourne Identity. It's faster paced and the characters are more believable. It's a down to earth Navy story with fewer twists and turns but more action. Maybe Bourne Identity will work better as a movie.
4,"review of ""The Bourne Identity"" by Robert Ludlum","Ludlum's celebrated ""The Bourne Identity"" is really nothing more than a modern day reworking of A.Dumas'""The Count of Monte Cristo""(a ""10"" in any translation)...the story of revenge and repressed identity has a thrilling Mediterranean opening,.. before Ludlum widens the scope of the novel across the face of Europe...the sheer sweep of the book is almost irresistible, and places it at the forefront of like genre thrillers;as a prose stylist,though, Ludlum is no Ambler or Greene.If you want to sample his work-this is the place to start....but just about any Frederick Forsyth novel of international intrigue will be better written and more accurate technically."
3,The movie(s) are MUCH better,"""I made a decision. It was the most difficult decision I've ever made in my life. I think a person can only make a decision like that if he's nearly lost his life by an act of violence, his life saved by someone else.""The above was said by Marie St. Jacques, Bourne's love interest throughout the novel, and illustrates Ludlum's total tone deafness in writing dialog. A woman would have said: ""if she's nearly lost her life...her life saved by someone else."" It's actually much worse than that. Ludlum writes the entire novel in a single voice, usually that of a third person speaking inside Bourne's head, but even the dialog sounds like that third person's voice.I finished the novel, even though I started to throw it in the trash several times, just to find out how it turned out. It didn't. Nothing was resolved.For the trivia types out there, Ludlum writes enough like a British writer, E. C. Tubb, that I thought they were the same person until I confirmed otherwise."
3,Good,"The condition was ""good,"" as described. It had a bit of water damage, but I found it on the porch in the rain, and I have no idea how long it was out there. Overall, it's readable and as far as I know not missing any pages or anything."
4,Great Book! Sucked me right in,Another fine title by Robert Lundlum. Grabs you right from the start and doesn't let go
3,The Bourne Identity,"A nice read but lacking something, I don't know what, to put it at the top. It is also one of those rare books in which the movie is better than the book, by a lot."
3,The movie is much better,"I am not a fan of the spy genre. This is the first book I picked up after watching the Matt Damon movie where he played Jason Bourne. I thought it was wonderful and since books are usually better than the movies, I thought the book would be even better.It turned out I was wrong because while the plot was pretty good, Ludlum cannot write for nuts. Seriously, I wince when I read the dialogue. Characters have no chemistry between them. I cannot feel Bourne's anguish because the writing is so technical. I felt that throughout the novel, rather than having an atmosphere of despair as Ludlum wanted to convey, all i got was he throwing it in my face that yes, poor bourne, poor thing.This book gets a 3 stars for the nice action and plot. If you can ignore the poor writing, it does make for a rather good read especially at the end. Oh and i don't plan to read the next 2 books."
4,Glad I saw the movie first,"Okay, I admit it, I saw the movie, then decided to read the book. I am a big fan of anything involving spies, yet had not read anything by Robert Ludlam until two weeks ago.First off, the movie and the book part ways in the scene when Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean. From that point on, the main character's motivation is the same, the past history seems the same, but the two stories are completely different. I loved the movie, I thought it was great, and hope they can make a franchise out of it. I am not sure how well it will work, given that a big draw is the man trying to figure out who he is.The book is very good. The story is clever, the characters are very well developed. It is a page turner, which means you might be going to sleep late if you start reading it.I finished the book last night, and will probably pick up the next one on the way home from work today."
4,Good but Slow,"I too started this book when I heard about the movie being made. It took me a while to get past page 20 (it is kind of overwhelming). Overall I liked the book, but I agree with the reviewer who said that there are fast-paced parts that keep you reading followed by dull action sequences and reiterations of things you've already learned. I liked the twists, but they got a little buried under unnecessary parts. But the good does outweigh the bad, so you should definitely try this book!"
4,Why?,"I just finished The Bourne Identity and was left with the question: Who originally shot Bourne and why? The book was good, but I think the movie will be easier to follow."
5,"A great read, especially for fans of the movie-","I picked this book out after I had seen and loved the movie. Immediately Ludlum's description of Jason Bourne throws any mental image you have of Matt Damon away- thank goodness.Jason Bourne is a man who can't remember who he is or where he's been. He seems to have much reconstructive surgery all over his body and has the ability to speak in many different languages and engage in various forms of combat, though he has no clue why.His journey leads him through uncovering conspiracy all the while discovering who he might be. It is an exciting read and I found myself unable to put the book down.If you enjoyed the movie you will definitely love the book even though it is vastly different and somewhat dated (1980). For me this is the ultimate spy novel and peaked my interest in reading more books once again when I finished it. A classic Ludlum novel and will surely spur readers to read some of his other works as well. Turn off the TV and read this book!"
3,"Ok for a read, but some long jumps","So I read this on a whim, seeing the book for sale for $1 at a thrift store. Remembering that I enjoyed the movie a long time ago, I figured the read would be pretty good. Turned out the book is simply ok, with more than a few parts really strecthing to make the story continue to flow. The connection to Les Classiques, the general, and the final scene were choppy to say the least. What started out as a very strong premise turned out to be medicore. So much time was spent in Bourne's head that I thought of Spiderman's catch phrase (""With great power...""). Now I have the ""Cain is..."" stuck in my head. Really overdone.Book was ok, would recommend for a quick read."
4,Simply amazing!,"Jason Bourne may be an agent with extra ordinary skills that normally only a robot can have. But you can't tell it simply to your friends. You are really stunned by the style of writing and the convincing flow of events. And you'll find a position in your heart for our hero. This is Jason Bourne. The bold and the beautiful. Because when you are reading this book, you won't get time to mind the time. It simply passes. If you want to fast for some hours, may be day, and you don't want to feel it, I'll recommend this thriller. Don't worry if you finish this book. Bourne is waiting"
3,Average Thriller,"A man washes ashore with no memory of his past, but with the skills of an expert killer. Who is he? Who does he kill? And for whom?Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity is full of action and an interesting plotline. Unfortunately Ludlum doesn't have the writing chops to equal his ideas. It should be a page turner but it isn't."
4,Great idea for a plot saves bad writing,"Really, the writing is just bad for a number of reasons. But for a pulp spy novel, it's a tremendous idea and Ludlum draws it out well. If you can stand a dose of bad characterization and annoying writing techniques in exchange for a great plot- pick it up. I liked this book quite a lot despite its flaws, which says a lot for the ideas Ludlum was capable of dreaming up."
4,Awsome book! -Curtis,"I read this book because I really liked the movie, only to be completely blown away! This book only slightly resembles the movie in that the main charachter (Jason Bourne) had amnesia, met Marie St. Jaques and there is a top secret government project, and he is considered a lethal mistake. He must be killed.It is abot a man that looses all his memory and through the help of a slightly insaine and drunk doctor learns enough to embark into the world knowing only that he is an expert with firearms, and has had plastic surgery.This action packed book leads the reader through the adventure of finding out who Jason bourne is. It involves assasins, top secret US government plots and international conspiracies. Overall a very exciting read. Anyone that liked this movie would probably like this book better. One of the better books I have read."
3,OK...as far as I got....,"I thought this book was OK, up until page 200 or so. I became very busy at work, and did not read it for a while. I found the plot twists and innumerable characters in the book so confusing to get back into I did not finish the book. Maybe one day I will pick it up again, but I really think there are better books I can spend my time with."
2,ok this book is ummm.,"i liked bourne or cain or david webb, whatever you want to call him. he was cool. but maria was so annoying, ""oh my only love,"" don't lie to me, i couldn't breathe i knew you were leaving. that was horrible it ruined the entire book. oh and the worst part... so who is carlos?"
5,Bourne Book,"Still one of the best books ever written, do not read it expecting what you saw in the movie, same idea different story"
2,Disappointing,"I had to force myself to keep reading this book (although it gets a little less bad from around chapter 25), and am surprised that it's such a hit.Most of it is grating, unrealistic dialogue. Characterisation is poor (eg the heroine, despite knowing nothing about the hero, becomes his lover and best friend following a brutal rape). The writing style lacks interesting turns of phrase or ideas (the most vivid description was of smoke ""spiralling"", and this was repeated several times)."
5,A Octogenarian Reader,This is an exciting and fast paced action novel typical of Robert Ludlum's suspense novels. For those who have watched Matt Damon create Jason Bourne this is a must-read...I don't read many action novels but the Bourne movies led me to seek out the novel that inspired the character.
4,so confused!,"This book took me six months to read. Not because i am a slow reader, but because i had other things to do, like read books for school. (Never ever ever read Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim) Because i would put the book down and pick it up several weeks later, i would often lose touch with the plot. This does not detract from the story, however, and in this department, Ludlum deliveres an action packed thrill ride. It seemed that I could actually feel the mental and physical turmoil of Jason Bourne. This book is a good read. Not ""Beach Reading"", but more of an in-depth read. Ludlum is like Clancy in that respect. If you lose track of what he's saying, you'll lose the entire book. All in all though, it was worth the six months i spent to read it."
2,dissapointed,"I guess I just expected too much. There was some really good action, but the characters and the plot development were lacking to say the least. Bourne meets up with the love interest Marie and their relationship was just too unbelievable. I couldn't figure out why they were together and it was like Ludlum was just inventing reasons on the fly for her to hang around and be useful. I was all ready to forgive as the story reached the climax, expecting a big finish and maybe a twist that I hadn't expected. But it flopped HARD! He just wrapped it up with such a wimpy ending, very dissapointed and wouldn't recommend it unless you just want a few action sequences (and there weren't even enough of those in my opinion)"
5,The Bourne Identity - Revisited,"I first read this book nearly 20 years ago and was mesmerized. As I read about Jason Bourne I had a motion picture star in mind that I imagined playing the part in a movie. I was so disappointed when a TV movie came out with some wimp playing the lead role. After seeing a trailer about the upcoming movie, I started cleaning out closets looking for my copy of the Bourne Identity. It is still a remarkable read after all these years and I am looking forward to seeing the movie with someone in the role that could be believable. I have read most of Robert Ludlum's novels and this one is my favorite."
5,Another of my favorite series,"I'm not much of a spy novel fan, but I loved this series of books. I really got into the characters. Great action and suspense."
5,Master storyteller's masterpiece,"Ludlum surpasses not only himself but all other spy thriller writers for all times to come. I started in 1977 with Scarlatti Inheritance and have ever since been hooked to Ludlum. But Bourne Identity exploded on me like no other book or experience I had. It is more than a spy story or about a person called Bourne trying to fight tremendous odds with a total memory loss with bursts of memory flashes of the violent past with layers of different personalities. It is about human mind itself discovering its way using the ultimate training of the past to protect it and achieve the objective imprinted in the psyche. The events will linger forever in the mind and you will be hungry to read another book which can match this book. Yes! Read it ,Enjoy it and be haunted by it."
4,Suspenseful- much better than the movie,Great character development. I loved the way that they were all portrayed. If you loved the movie then you are in for a treat. After reading the book I don't even like the movie because I feel like all the best parts were omitted from the movie. The plot was genius.
4,A Rambo/Bond with mental problem,"A complex plot that may keep you hooked, but the main combatant Delta/Cain is unbelievebly tough -- he beats up or kills countless bad guys -- almost like superman. He is incredible but too unreal for me. If you want to read about a guy on the run from everyone and is more like a real person, try ""The Dogs of Riga""."
2,The movie was better.,"Good action, good pacing. The dialogue is unspeakable, and dated in a pretentious way. The basic idea of the Bourne character is interesting but the book should be rewritten by someone with a better ear."
2,Falling apart.,"I've only read a 1/3 of the book and the pages are already separating from the binding. I know lower quality glues are used, but this is outrageous. I'm a voracious, but careful reader. I don't stretch spines or crease pages. I expect better from a book that wasn't inexpensive for a paperback.The story is great of course, but this is insanely poor quality control.Sincerely,Ralph Henderson"
5,A Great Book!,This is the only book that I have ever finished reading the last page and turned to the first page and started it again! It is great!
2,"It's okay, I guess.","The doctor who finds Bourne is shown as a drunk but seems quite intelligent when you pick up his comments to Bourne. It didn't add up.I just didn't find the female character all that believable. She seemed too easy to jump into a love story and deny all of her other existence.Last, Carlos flew to the US the same time are Bourne did in the end. Why didn't anyone mention looking on the plane rosters that morning.Carlos who is said to be a well known face rushes past dozens of people, though one entry and no one says a word or looks at himGunfire in a house and no one calls the police.Just plain weak."
5,Vintage Ludlum,"I thought this book was really good. Robert Ludlum is a good author. I read this book right before the movie came out. I think one of the things I liked about it was the characters and what they go through in the book. Jason Bourne is my favorite character in this book. The emotional things he has to go through are interesting, and educational at the same time. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes Robert Ludlum, or spy thrillers."
3,Interesting but predictable,"Finished last night (21 Sept, 2009). I received this as a gift. The movie is one of my favorites. It was interesting but predictable. Ok I was reading this while watching Monday night football. This book was the basis for the movie. It takes place in the mid seventies. I might have been more interested in this book if I didn't realize that Bourne doesn't get killed. Also, there are 3 or four more books written by Ludlum that revolve around Bourne. I found this theme to be already used by many other authors. Maybe Ludlum was the first to use it or i just read some others that seemed to be better. I am fond of Detective novel & murder mysteries.I will move on to some other books I have at home to read. I am not really impressed with this book. I have other genres of books that I want to finish."
2,"Lots of Good Action, Too Unrealistic","I think Jason Bourne's name changes two or three times in the book before you get to the end. The action is good, but it's too unrealistic. Unless you're into books that include the die hard James Bond character who manages to survive every impossible scenario, but has time for a love affair all the while trying to learn his identity and escaping the bad guys, then this book is for you. I hope the movie is better."
1,Godawful,"There's nothing like a good page-turner, but this isn't it. Like all Ludlum plots, there's a killer hook (amnesiac assassin seeks his past), but 600 pages of implausible and tedious mush lies behind it. Ludlum also writes like a court stenographer, which doesn't help matters. Try Household or Buchan instead."
2,"Entertain your friends, read the dialogue aloud at parties","I listened to the audio version which highlighted one of Ludlum's greatest problems: he has a tin ear for dialogue and when you have to listen to the stuff that comes out of these people's mouths, well, I kept replaying snippets for my wife, so she could laugh and roll her eyes. Gave it an extra star for a great concept, but had to give up on the thing about 70% through. Painfully funny became just... painful."
4,Intriguing and thorough,"The Bourne Identity is a well-written thriller. It has a strong and consistant plot spiced with many details. I think that even though it might not be that believable at times, that is what a book is created for, to escape our ""real world.""Robert Ludlum produced a world where confusion and caas engulf Jason Bourne. This leaves Bourne to travel the unknown labyrinth of the world and his own mind. All the time, facing new and dangerous adventures. To sum it up, it was a fun book to read."
4,Great book -- Couldn't put it down...,"This was my first Ludlum book -- and I was very impressed. For this genre, it is rare that you find yourself thinking about the details of the plot between the times you are able to read.I really enjoyed how the author slowly revealed the main character to the audience. My only complaint is that the other characters seemed to be a little shallow (minus a star for this...)The story is that a man is brought to a doctor with horrible injuries and no memory of who he is or was. The doctor only shows him a piece of microfilm surgically implanted into his body with the name ""Jason Bourne"" and a number of a bank account. This man must figure out who he is while he is being chased by the police and other assassins (who know him, but he doesn't know them...)Great story -- You will probably figure out the ending towards the end of the book, but you won't be able to put it down regardless."
3,Thriller/suspense,Its an ok book. I felt that it dragged on a little and so didnt enjoy it as much as I thought I might.
3,"""Flashbacks Didn't Ignite Me""","I gave this novel three stars because I felt that Robert Ludlum used Flashbacks too much and as a kind of filler and I hate too much filler. I think that the author did OK with the flashbacks which I know are much more diffficult to do in a book than in a movie. Again I just feel he used them too much and caused it to drag a good story line down. I do enjoy this type of special ops story and I will read the rest of the ""Bourne"" series, but it will have to go some to reach the level of Vince Flynn's ""Mitch Rapp"" Series."
5,Bourne Identity,I love an action thriller with some modern situations that we hear about in the newspapers every day.This Novell could be very well happening as we speak - with so many of our operatives exposed with WikiLeaks -I am sure we have people who are on the run and they don't even know why they are runningJason Bourne
4,Robert Ludlum hits a home run with Jason Bourne...,"Robert Ludlum is not one of my favorite authors. His novels have been hit-or-miss for me. However, the whole Jason Bourne concept is a winner. A man wakes up after being shot, with no memories of who he is. It slowly becomes apparent that what he does remember would fit well in the category of... professional assassin.Not the kind of thing you brag to Mom about, even if you could remember her name!I enjoyed both the book and themovie, although there are some significant plot differences between the two. In the book, the focus is on a battle with international terrorist Carlos. In the movie, it is a battle between Bourne and his ""handlers.""Beware of old men!"
4,Don't Expect the Movie.,"Just a few quick thoughts:- The story in this book has nothing to do with the movie by the same title.- I really enjoyed watching the movie.- I really enjoyed reading the book.So long as you know they're completely different stories, plots, and mostly different characters; you'll have no problem. It's ok to view them as two different works of entertainment."
2,Mediocre!,"The concept was great--a man with no identity but with tantalizing clues to a dangerous past. I loved the story line but felt that the book should have been condensed. The main character was too introspective and whining. It seemed out of character with his supposedly ""tough-guy"" past and experiences. I skipped paragraph after paragraph of his monotonous reflecting and self-berating. I do not recommend recommend this book"
4,Ludlum is one of the few genius story tellers,"Ludlum's spy thriller incaptivated me. The confusion involved with not knowing the actual identity of Jason Bourne until the end added to the intrigue of the book. There was not a single page where I found myself bored. Ludlum definitely has the talent to compare with the renowned authors such as J.R.R. Tolkein. Reading his novel was like reading a modern day Agatha Christie mystery.While the movie looks good, I'd reccommend that everyone read the book. Movies are just never the same."
3,Good buildup...but no resolution,"A pretty good read if you can get past a few amazingly absurd leaps of logic. The book starts out pretty slow but really gets going in the middle, with a build to the end that will certainly keep you reading. Sadly, the ending does virtually nothing to resolve the story. I'm still mystified by the climactic finale scene despite re-reading it. Perhaps the pending movie will make some sense of it."
1,The first- and last - spybook I will ever read,"I bought this book a few days after seeing the movie, which I really liked. At first the book was OK, not great, but fine. But then Marie entered. Personaly, she annoyed the hell out of me. She acted like no human being I have ever met. For example, she gets kidnaped by Jason, held hostage by him, he theatens her with a gun, he hits her several times, another man rapes her, and a few days later she's all ready for a relationship ... Now if I were her, I think I'd be developing some serious trust isues, not jumping some injured spy.This Ludlum guy obviously doesn't know much about women. Not to mention all the ""My love, you cannot leave me"" [stuff]. I had to stop reading it about 200 pages in. Do yourself a favor; skip the book and see the movie.(Matt Damon kicks ... in the movie)."
3,fantastic!!!!,I couldn't put the book away!!!One of the best thrillers I have ever read!!!!Can't wait to read the sequels...
1,I give up!,"I can count on one hand the number of books I have not finished once started. This is one of them. The movies were OK so I figured I'd give the book a try. I managed to make it 164 pages and just can't force myself to go on. It's pretty bad that the author can't keep track of what kind of gun is being carried by a given character. First it's a revolver, then a paragraph or two later it's an automatic, then it's a revolver again, all describing the same gun! Even worse, one of the bad guys is described as carrying a long-barreled revolver with a silencer. Anyone at all familiar with firearms knows that you can not silence a revolver! For those not in the know, a tremendous amount of blast and noise escapes from around the cylinder gaps. Can't silence that.I could go on but I would just be repeating what many of the other 1 and 2 star reviewers have stated.I'm just glad I bought the book used and am only out a couple bucks."
3,"Too Slow for a Thriller, Too Random for a Mystery","But I have to admit, he kept me guessing.The plot is tense and exciting, the premise is phenomenal, but the storytelling is weak. I had to struggle through to the end, and decided not to pursue the rest of the series."
5,Fascinating and intringing,"A real page turner . It grabs you from the very first page and builds up to a crescendo. The reader gets the reader into the mind of the protagonist , and the excitement and mystery of what transpires takes your breath away. Bravo, bravo to the very talented author who spins a tale of intrigue and mystery that keeps the reader spellbound., I give this book all 5 stars without any reservation or hesitation."
4,"Good, quick, fun read.","If you want an action story with all the surprise bells and whistles then here you go. The Bourne Identity is a good story as a book. The Bourne Identity is a good story as a movie; don't confuse the two, they are very different. That said, check 'em out but don't bash one because it's unlike the other; movies and books will never run on the same tracks."
5,Whoever said the movie was great didn't read the book,"I was encouraged to read the Bourne Identity due to my mother's persuassion and my love of spy novels. Of course, I was eager to try a new author since I had read at least twelve of John Grisham's in a row and was needing a break from the lawyer frenzy. In the midst I found myself caught up in the unusual twists and the unsuspecting turns of this phenominal book. Ludlum is an extraordinary author who has an amazing ability to captivate your mind.The twists in this book are far greater than what is reflected in the movie. Hollywood, will be Hollywood, thus adding material that is nonexistant in the book in order to spice things up. Unfortunately for Ludlum's advent readers, we were given a waterdowned version of an extraordinary novel."
5,amazing,"I have read most, if not all, of Ludlum's books.The Bourne books are my favorite ( I have read all three two times each). exciting, well written, interesting, etc. These books are absolutely flawless.p.s. both attempts at making this book a movie were absolutely horrible"
2,Good idea spoiled by execution,The promising plot is ruined by the device of having the book narrated by a simpleton and thoroughly unsympathetic and unbelievable characters. The dialog is artificial and the pace is tedious. The reviewers seemed to like it though.
3,What a slow and dull novel.,"I am reading the novel Gallowglass for a school project and constantly find myself falling asleep while trying to read it. I read the other reviews and people seem to enjoy this novel, but if I ever finish it, I know I did not enjoy it. The only interesting device Barbara Vine uses is the tecnique of switching narrators. It reminds me of the novel, ""The Collector"" by John Fowles. If you come to enjoy Gallowglass, I would recommend The Collector, as it is a novel which keeps a steady pace."
1,"I love Barbara Vine, but this book was a big disappointment","Usually Barbara Vine novels feature richly drawn, believable characters, but I found the people in this book uninteresting, unlikeable and (especially in the case of the dimwitted central character) unintelligent. Plus the novel just drags on and on and on--I wanted it to end long before it did. I'm surprised I finished it at all, that's how bad it was. But Vine/Rendell is one of my favorite novelists ever, that's why I stayed with it. Those new to her work will be much better served by reading fascinating and gripping Vine novels such as ""Anna's Book,"" ""No Night Is Too Long,"" ""The Chimney Sweeper's Boy"" and ""A Dark-Adapted Eye."" She's a master at creating vivid, suspenseful psychological novels, and she's at the peak of her powers in those books."
4,another good read from the mistress of mystery,"absorbing reading, as always from Rendell. The peopel are believeable and the story is fascinating. i quibble with the plot line though, i wonder that the ending is possible with a security freak for a husband as Nina had, and i wonder at the character of Sandor to be so obsessivly in love with a woman he kidnapped? Other than that, it agian shows Rendells abbility to read minds and her charchaters inner souls. very interesting story."

2,Best anti-American propaganda has always come from Hollywood.,"Starts out promising but after the intermission, (cut short), makes sharp left turn into anti-American drivel. The new Rambo movie, which I also purchased in Blu-Ray, covers largely the same story line, (disillusioned American soldier rescuing missionarys caught in a war zone), but Rambo does it much better. Steve McQueen seems embarrassed throughout the second half of the movie. Good movie to show to the kids to let them see how crappy the 60s were for entertainment. Picture quality excellent, kind of sparse on the special features."
5,King of Cool at His Best,"This was a great movie! It was even better the second time around. I can understand why it was naminated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steve McQueen.Candice Bergen was simly beautiful. A face so plain and yet so gorgeous. Her simple beauty illuminated the screen. Beauty and talent all in one package.GREAT MOVIE! Five Stars + The king of Cool equals six."
3,great movie deserves better,"Why do companies keep putting out dual discs? Everyone I talk to hates them and I personally will not buy them. This is such a let down for me. I have noticed a lot of new releases with 4.0 or 2.0 or even mono sound!!! Is this the 21st century with new technology or are we regressing with our technology? Every single new dvd release should be in both 5.1 and 5.1 dts and the option of the original sound! I personally am tired of the repackaging and lack of quality special features ( fluff )The only way the companies will change is the way you spend your money. They did alot of good things on this edition and then get cheap with making one disc a dual disc. DO NOT BUY DUAL DISCS!!!! This is another special edition that should have been re-mixed in 5.1 and made to 3 discs if it would not fit on 2!!!! I vote "" NO BUY "" The same goes for Von Ryans express ( 2.0 )"
3,Yellow Sea US Navy-1926,"A long epic story is about the US Navy regiment deployed in Yellow Sea as a part of geopolitics surrounding the Chine-1926 revolution, embedded from notions of history and characters' personal involvement.Might be much better comprehended if the second part of a film (scenes 20-32) could be watch technically on that particular DVD borrowed."
3,"Overrated, but not miscast McQueen","Steve McQueen is not nearly miscast in Sand Pebbles as he is in Papillion. Bergen's youthful naivete is quite refreshing, and Attenborough is well-cast as supporting character ""Frenchy."" Overall, this far-reaching epic runs about 30 minutes too long."
5,The Sand Pebbles,The Sand Pebbles: This is the best and it is based on a true story. Everyone in it is great!
2,Condition of discs,"The disc marked ""disc 1"" was too damaged to use. But the disc marked ""disc 2 side A Extended Roadshow Version"" had only minor scratches and we were able to see the entire movie."
4,The Roadshow Is Unwatchable,"I was looking forward to seeing the roadshow edition of this film with the extra footage, but who decided to just copy over a faded and overly red copy of it? I gave up halfway through; it's just unwatchable and hard on the eyes. They should have done what Fox did with ""South Pacific"": insert the faded footage into the pristine shorter version. Then your eyes would get a rest. This would be a five-star package were it not for the mishandling of the roadshow edition. Buy it if you don't own the film, because it's a very good picture with good acting of an engrossing story. If you already have it, don't bother spending the extra money."
4,"Steve McQueen, Always Ready To Please.","This movie like most of McQueen's is great. An epic to be sure, if your looking for a great classic to buy for your library this is the one. Great Actors, Great Story Line, Great Movie."
5,"Love and a ""Not War""","I have replaced the DVD version of ""The Sand Pebbles"" with Bluray and it delivers all it promises. I'll say no more about technology. This remains to this day perhaps the finest anti-war film ever; capped off by the line delivered by the Missionary ""...it's too late in the world for flags"". With the (possible) exception of Bullitt, this is McQueen's finest performance. The luxury of a movie that takes it time and films SCENES instead of snapshots always makes me long for a David Lean film (see ""Bridge"", ""Lawrence"" and ""Doc Z""). Try it - you'll like it."
5,Sand Pebbles,"An amazing, beautiful film that is flawlessly executed. My dad was not much of a movie watcher, but this is the only film that he ever actually watched twice!!!"
3,"Big on style, less on substance.","This is a very impressive looking traveling humidor, both the online image, as well as the impression you get when you first look at the case. When you open it up however, you have a slight sinking feeling that you paid too much for it. It's nice enough I suppose, and adequately serves the purpose for which I bought it for, but I did get the impression it would be a little nicer. The ""spanish cedar"" lining is a very thin sheet. The areas that can be filled with water are surrounded by felt-covered plastic. The cutter is very standard. I knew it came with a box of matches, but for the price, it really could come equipped with a decent lighter. Maybe I shouldn't have expected more, but I did, and I have to admit I was slightly disappointed. Guess I should've ""bit the bullet"" and paid a little more for a nicer one."
4,Great for the golfer Husband,perfect size for the golf bad or glove compartment of the car.Shipping is a little high from source - but the product is very nice
3,Do they Work?,"Ok, the first time I tried this product I gave it a month ""kick in"" and it did seem to help by the second month, so I thought it had ""built up"" in my system and was ""taking effect."" I was very satisfied as my horrible hot flashes (every 40 minutes 24-7) had subsided. BUT the third month it seemed to stop helping completely. So it may be up to each individual and what sypmtoms you are trying to relieve - but I am begining to think it's all about your body chemistry fluctuating making you think that whatever your doing at the time is working and am not so confident that any natural remedy actually works. I would say, give it a try, but don't expect immediate relief or a miracle."
3,"Not for long term use, starts dripping",We used this to connect our irrigation system to the garden faucet as the faucet is in front of the door and without something with an angle would block the door. First this seemed a great piece but after two month it started dripping quite some - which defies the reason for using a drip irrigation to safe water.
2,Junk,"Poorly made, when I tightened it down the crimp sprung a leak. I would not recommend this to a friend."
1,AP World History Flash Cards,"I purchased these flash cards for my daughter to help her prepare for the AP World History exam. She did not think the cards were helpful at all. She found that they had too much info on each card, not what flash cards typically have. She had hoped that it was one quick question on the front with the answer on the back. Her plan was to study with her friends that were also taking the exam, but the cards had too much info on the back."
2,AP World Flash Cards,I bought these cards for my ap world history class because they were required. I really didn't use them that much because they aren't very good. I love flash cards I make them for everything! But this is not a very good product. I didn't like this review book either. If you want to learn something and have a good study tool for your ap world history class buy http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-World-History-College-Preparation/dp/0375429956/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1283638171&sr=8-1 Its the best!
3,World History Flash Cards,"These cards were not what we expected, and expensive. They are in no particular order to match with school learning.Very disappointing"
5,HOT HORROR FLICKS.,"THE MOVIE DEVIL'S REJECTS,IS MY FAVORITE ...THE MOVIE IS A CLASSIC..THE SOUNDTRACK IS HOTTTT..I ORDERED THE MOVIE TO HEAR THE MUSIC AS WELL.. IVE ALSO TOLD A COUPLE FRIENDS ABOUT IT..SO WHEN THE MOVIE COME WE'LL HAVE A FREIGHT FEST....THANKS,HORROR CHICK.."
5,Very Satisfied,I was only expecting the third disc to be a short behind the scenes look but it took you through every day of filming. I definately think it was worth the money.
4,Rob Zombie 3-Disc Collector's Set (House of 1000 Corpses/Devil's Rejects),"I purchased the set for $7.99 at Ralph's grocery store. The set includes three dvds (two full length movies, the other an documentary about the making of the Devil's Rejects). The case is the size of standard DVD case, it is a cardboard cover.House of 1000 Corpses - This one was really good and creepy. The deaths were really...weird and creepy. This a creepy movie and its really ""unique"". 5/5Devils Rejects - This one wasn't as good as I expected, but it was okay. It was just about this family who murder people for fun and they are called the Devil's Rejects. It was okay, watch Halloween I or II instead."
3,Nothing New It Seems.,"I have yet to buy this yet because frankly it's nothing new from what a fan of the films would have. Aside from maybe fancy new packaging, all that's included are the DVDs of ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" in addition to the ""30 Days in Hell"" making of Rejects. The ""30 Days in Hell"" was already packaged with Rejects when it was released much earlier. I'm in love with the films, but there isn't a reason to buy this unless you don't already have them. No extra special features, nothing new. Maybe in a year or so, they'll release another one with some extra content. Til then, it's not necissary unless you really want another copy of the film."
5,Wonderful,This was perfect for the Valentine's Day project that I was working on with my daughter. I am 100% satisfied.
4,Smaller than I expected,"So, despite the name, I didn't expect each heart to be quite so small. I bought this pan to make Valentine brownies for my boyfriend. The brownies were the size of brownie bites, but they came out of the pan easily and held their shape."
1,Spoilt reissue,"This is the original LP and mixes but with one notable exception. Some complete lame brain at Arista has replaced Ron Dante's superb original mix of Copacabana with a dreadful extended disco remix. No more do we have the expansive euphoric cinematic soundscape, but a bass drum heavy mix with all the chordal harmony ruined, god awful string section eq, poor balance and uneven use of reverb. If it had to be included why not just as an extra, so we can skip it? Do yourself a favour, avoid this travesty and transfer your old vinyl to CD. Why do record companies do this to us? What a letdown."
5,Classic Manilow Old School Love&Memories,"More of Manilows GREATEST songs that steal your heart through his classic music,beautiful words and one in a NEVER again style."
4,"Not His Best, But Still Okay","I do enjoy listening to it on occasion and it does bring back memories some good some bad, but its still okay."
3,They Should Have Warned Us,"I loved the record, so when it got too scratched up I bought the CD. I assumed, foolishly, that the songs were the same. Unfortunately Copacabana has a different (and in my opinion completely inferior) arrangement. The others are the same as the record, but Copacabana was my favorite and I'm ticked that they changed it. That dropped my rating from a five to a three."
3,Love the Voices,"I have always loved this group since the I first heard them. As I would've expected, the vocals on this album are absolutely fantastic and impeccable, however, the selection of songs was not what I was hoping it would be. Overall, it is still an enjoyable album and I'm glad I bought it."
4,GOOD MUSIC!!!,"If you are a fan of Glad & you enjoy oldies, this is a must have. Glad is a group that combine their notorious voices to create an incredible melody. I quite don't understand why they have not been able to become more popular. They do possess the talent & the charisma. I have almost all of their A Capella music."
5,I finally found it!!!,I heard this ablum once and knew I had to have it. I looked everywhere for it. This is the only place that had it!
5,Miracle Worker,"I started taking colloidal minerals after a cavity left me with a terrible toothache. Dentists wanted to do a root canal, but that didn't make sense to me, so I began researching. I literally bought this one day, and the next, my pain was gone. I also cut out refined items from my diet, began to alkalize, and started taking calcium and vitamin K. I believe all of these things are what saved my root, but mainly I credit the minerals for eradicating my pain almost instantly. It's scary how malnourished we are without even knowing it. I recommend anyone and everyone take colloidal minerals. NOW brand is nice because they claim to screen for the negative heavy metals, whereas other brands I've researched do not make that claim. I have tried both this raspberry flavor and the unflavored one, and both are more than palatable. The unflavored one tastes like lemon-lime, and this raspberry one is delicious without leaving a nasty aftertaste in your mouth."
3,Yet another good Roger Corman movie,"One of my old favorites. Love Rodger Corman movies. Could have been better quality being a Blu-ray, but still good purchase."
4,interesting B movie,"Interesting B movie from early 80s I had never seen. I was a teen when this came out. I was ill in hospital, my brother was a movie theatre mgr at the time and wanted me to come watch this. I was not prepared for the degree of avante-garde subliminal filmmaking technique of the director, I found it very interesting. Beautiful women, some good actors, a good overall story. Very Good Corman-produced movie!"
3,"Another ""Alien"" Wannabe - Corman-style","Yet another film that serves as nothing more than a cheap rip-off of ""Alien"". Some of the gore effects are done very well but the monster is laughable. The pacing of the film is a bit slow in parts so I found myself getting bored a few times. The two actresses in the film are the best part of the film because they are pure eye candy. Other than that, this is nothing essential unless you like to collect b-movies."
3,Roger Corman schmaltz,"Forbidden World is a typical Roger Corman work. Like ""Star Crash,"" it is a cheaper version of other films with the same basic premise of an alien creature run amok in a remote space station. The sets are common place, the acting is mediocre, the musical score is average, the special effects are not at all special, and the obligatory nudity scenes are shot through colored filters typical of the era. I don't know who taught Roger Corman how to edit, but he was not paying attention. Somebody should have explained the concept of ""continuity"" to Roger Corman, geez!"
2,rentable only...,"If you have the ability to, rent this drive-in movie quality blu-ray for the (unintended) larfs, nudity and sex - if you're into that sort of thing. Otherwise avoid it completely. May be difficult to play on players not updated with current software - don't ask me why!"
5,One of his best,"Although a relatively obscure film (even for Corman standards), it is a fun film in the process gaining so resurgence among fans of Corman and cheasy 80's Sci-fi. If you disliked it it for its just-above-mediocre-acting, and cheap special effects, you cannot denying this was fun to watch.Things that make this film awesome1: Jesse Vint plays a Han Solo like-character who is an expert at scoring girls and killing aliens2: SAM, a robot that is Vint's sidekick who for a robot sucks at shooting3: HOT NAKED CHICKS4: The weird soundtrack5: (SPOILER ALERT) A mutant that barfs to death after eating a cancerous liverJust make sure you watch this late at night with mountain dew, an HDTV, friends, and loud speakers and you will enjoy this film."
3,OLD SCHOOL TERROR,ITV WAS PRETTY GOOD THERE'S 2 HOT WOMEN IN NOT 2 MUCH HUMOR IN IT THE ACTION IS KINDA COOL THE MONSTER DOES LOOK SCARY BUT AS FAR AS THE SO CALLED SPECIAL FEATURES ARE CONCEREND THEY SUCK BECAUSE OUT OF ALL THE ACTOR IN THE MOVIE YOU ONLY HERE FROM ONE OF THEM AND THE MAIN STAR
2,Not The Best,"Too many words come up ""No Result Found."" I find myself going back to Microsoft Word's Thesuarus time and time again."
2,I don't like it,"I don't like the software, it's not compatible with the the Oxford English Dictionary software that I previously bought. It's not clear that it isn't actually from the Oxford series. It does work, but to use with the dictionary when writing a paper you have to have two programs running instead of just one. It's just inconvenient. If you aren't going to use it with another software then it works fine, except that I don't like the layout of the window... I just don't like it. But it works."
1,give me a break!,"okay, i have got to say that the author is hands down, the most appaling misogynist ive had the pleasure(?) of meeting. ive also sampled his food, not impressed. his bedroom game, equally lackluster."
4,works well for basic oral skills,"This is really a good cd set for oral communication. There is lots of vocab, grammar and bits about dialect in the lessons on the discs that aren't in the booklet. You get some basic skills right away. The third disc is really good for advancing listening skills. Price is fair, too. The little music bits between every track wouldn't be missed. The ""narrator"" was better than the lady on other TY titles. Very happy with it."
2,CD Arabic Conversation,I am making a short trip to Morocco...thought there would be some easy greetings....it starts right our with conversation...I possibly bought the wrong CD.
1,Not very user friendly.,I was using this book for online course work and found it very hard to follow and that there were not enough examples to properly explain the different subjects.
2,Not a Promising Start For Fabric's Fabriclive Series,"Even as a Professional DJ, it must be a daunting task to be selected to kick-off a series that is associated with a respected London club name like Fabric. Smartly, Fabric chose to showcase two (generally) distinctive sounding subseries with single-disc compilations. The much more mainstream studio mixes falling under the Fabric series and the live sets (which ARE actually live for the most part) modelled after the club's popular friday nights. Fabriclive. Nice concept.For me, truely recorded live sets lose that special ""live element"" (which makes them so great) when transferred to a commercial album. This premier (which I believe was not recorded live) fails in so many ways. 23 tracks on a single CD should be your first red-flag that this set is not going to fly with most people (except die-hard James Lavelle fans).2/5 stars."
2,Huh?,"-This compilation left me feeling disappointed. The mix weaves in different directions, putting the listener on edge, leaving him unsatisfied. Incomplete. Random. Neurotic. Inclusion of Green Velvet's ""La-La-Land"" totally ruined whatever goodness there was in the mix.The album is as coherent as this review.-"
4,He's still got it!,"Having not seen Mr.T on the screens in a long time, (he's obviosly not as well known down here in Down Under as he is in the States)only to have him pop up in a tank in a hilarious 'Snickers' commercial made me keen to get a dose of The T. I really enjoyed this series. It doesn't go for long, but I guess the man likes to be to the point! He encounters people with various problems and helps them out in his own unique way. It's true, he doesn't really put anyone down. It seems more about education than humiliation. At the same time there's some good laughs in it. Recommended."
1,"Apparently, the fairer sex does not dig this","The reviews about ""musky odor"" made me think it would be suitable for men. Q10 works for our skin too, right? Apparently not. My partner hated this. Her comment: ""Smells like an old woman"". Old spice, masculine. Old woman, definitely not (Ok, maybe Thatcher). At least it didn't cause a rash on the back of our baby's knee. She may have been complaining that her knee smells like an old woman, but I could not translate ""doi-doi-doi-daaa-daa"" yet. Still working on it."
1,Cute and comfy BUT...,"the pair I received was defective. the pleats on the toe area were not as pictured (it was wrinkly and not perfectly folded over). also, i've only worn them a couple of times but the seam between the two pieces of the toe area is unraveling. i noticed it when i first got it however now it is beginning to tear the leather right at that ""V"" part. i was going to order a new pair but they don't have my size anymore. even though they fell apart, i would buy a new pair (if they still had my size!) because they are so cute."
5,versatile and incredibly soft,A great shoe and the leather is SO soft (it almost makes me wonder how long it will last!). In black the folds add just enough difference to make this more than an ordinary skimmer....
4,Porky Calls,"Porky Pig was created in the early to mid 1930's. From that point, he went on to become Warner Brothers very first cartoon superstar.The 1988 video, Porky Pig Tales, is a collection reflecting the swine at his peak in animation. Each cartoon is as strong as stuttering as you could expect. It contains mainly featured roles opposite Charlie Dog, in Awful Orphan, and his work playing a sidekick with Daffy Duck in My Little Duckaroo and China Jones.While Porky Pig was written off when Bugs Bunny came into full swing, Porky Pig still was known as one of the greats. This collection still suits it up straight. Oh boy, oh bo...bo..bbb..boy."
2,Gave it away.,"Agree with previous post- pillow strap stretched out to useless when left in sun/dew for a few weeks. I live in southern CA and the weather isn't overly harsh, so disappointed with handrails pealing and overall deterioration of item in a matter of 2 months. Gave two stars as it was very comfortable."
4,Microphone Works Well,"Length:: 2:52 MinsI read all the reviews and then tested the microphone on my Sony HDR-HC3. I agree with others that the gun mode is best. And there might be uses for the zoom affect, like having the sound increase in strength as one moves into a scene. But in normal mode like filming wedding vows from a distance the gun mode would be best while zoomed or not zoomed."
4,compared to the camcorder mic...,"This really isn't as bad as everyone's saying. Compared to what you get standard on most cameras, this mic does a great job in picking up dialogue. Just point and shoot. I'm pretty satisfied."
1,Sony ECM-HGZ1 with DCR-DVD505,This product didn't appear to add any appreciable sound benefit; the sound from the ECM-HGZ1 appears to be the same as that recorded with the native audio of the camera itself. I wish I had not bought it.
1,Doesn't perform up to expectations.,"I realize this is not a true gunshot mic though I had hope. The product presents itself as cheap and I hate to say the results are not good quality. At this time, I'm the only reviewing customer and I can see I must have been the only guy to buy one of these.Product attaches well and there is a noticable change in the audio. Three settings, zoom (syncs with camcorder's zoom), gun (which maxs the zoom of the mic regardless of video zoom), and off.I purchased this to make recordings of presentations better. I know now that I should have just bought a wireless mic for the speaker. I thought I'd get more use this route."
2,Poor Quality All The Way Around,"I was very disappointed with this mic. I wanted to be able to do interviews at a construction site. Even though we were several 100 yards away and there was little machinery running at the time, the audio was poor. I had a constant hiss in the audio. The mic is very light weight and feels cheap, almost like a ""toy"" mic. Since SONY makes sure you can use only their mics, you don't have much choice. I am thinking about getting their wireless mic, but after seeing the quaility of this one, I'm a little hesitant to buy another SONY mic."
2,not impressed,"I have a Sony HDR-SR11 camcorder, which unfortunately, having an Active Interface Shoe is compatible only with a few Sony microphones, such as this one.I made several recordings with and without the microphone and found no difference in the sound quality and amplitude."
4,Better than the builit-in microphone,"This product improved the audio as compared to the built-in microphone, but it still leaves a recording with some background noise - a low hissing sound. It's not too loud, but if you're looking for broadcast quality recordings you'll need a better camera and a better microphone. I have software to delete the noise, so for me it works. And considering the low price of the camera and microphone, I can't complain."
1,Hardly any better than the bulit-in mic,"This microphone is a disappointment to me. The sound quality of the interviews I am taping does not improve much at all. I tried the two different modes (zoom and gun) and found no difference/improvement. I even disasembled and reattached the mic a couple of times because I thought it was not working at all. But I am afraid that was not the problem. It was ""working""."
4,Ok for the price,"I bought this because my cameras stock mic is garbage so I bought this shot gun mic. It works great except for the zoom feature, I can't tell if it works or not, but I am still happy with the normal feature of the shot gun mic"
3,No improvement over camera mic,There was no improvement over using my SR11's built in mic as far as quality... the Zoom sounded compressed... I returned this.
2,Not impressed,I bought the Sony shotgun mic for my Sony handycam HDR-CX550V. I was very disappointed with the sound quality. I checked the quality with my sony studio headphones. Does not work like I thought it would. On the Shotgun mode the audio seems to record with higher frequencies and with almost no bass and the quality goes low. On the Zoom mode it seems like it's off. I'm hoping Sony comes out with something better. I don't mind paying more for better quality.
2,Not good,"I bought this mic about a year ago for a sony SR7, and when I mounted it on the camera I could barely tell the difference between it and the onboard mic. I recommend getting the RODE video mic that has significantly better sound quality. Also, the mic broke not long after I bought it. I really wasn't too disappointed though."
2,"Great Price, Fast Delivery, but disappointing sound quality","I purchased this add on mic in hopes to get a clearer, stronger, and enhanced sound quality from spokesperson doing short range demonstration videos from 6' to 15' range. In the zoom setting the sound intensity and quality was barely equal to but no better than the intergrated unit.In gun mode, the voice from the person speaking directly toward the mic sounded slightly muted and tinny like as though speaking through a tin can. It did though minimize peripheral sounds but at the cost of dynamic quality. In summary the built in speaker in my HDR-SR11 offered a clearer, more dynamic sound than the ECM-HGZ1 under the mentioned conditions. Also must mention that the ECM-HGZ1 feels omniously delicate and vunerable to heavy handed pressure. A NON recommendation for this product, But Amazon.com LLC rocks, fast, reliable order processing, and highly satisfactory delivery efficiency, especially to Honolulu, Hawaii. Aloha !!!"
1,No Difference,There is no distict difference between using the regular built in camera microphone vs. the shotgun microphone. We tried it at every setting and it made absolutely no difference at all. Save your money.
4,Sony Handycam Shotgun Mike,"The Sony ECM-HGZ1 Shotgun microphone is inexpensive with surprisingly high fidelity for the price. It does almost as well as some of my professional, wired mikes. It attaches easily to the hot shoe of my Handicam. No batteries are neeed. Rated against professional shotgun mikes which cost over ten times as much and have a five star rating, the ECM HGZ1 is at least a four star mike."
4,Plastic model included??,"How bizarre is this? CD comes with a red plastic model inside the box! Did they used to make cereal? Nice mix of Twisted by Ultra Nate. Koop, Royksopp, Sawhney and some lesser knowns all nicely laid out on thirteen tracks."
1,This isn't a book,"Despite what Amazon might have you believe, this is not a BOOK. It is a tiny pamphlet, designed to be a *teaching guide for high school students*. Even in that capacity, it's incoherent and amateurish. Just say no, or rather, complain to Amazon for padding out their database with this sort of rubbish non-entry."
5,perry ellis 360 white by perry ellis for men,"Well, it is great for gift, but its smell is not attractive cologne in the market. You pay what you get. Thanks anyway."
3,Beginner's Dictionary of Chinese-Japanese Characters,"book is a little hard to get around in, useful but I can see where it could have been put together a little better for a beginner it is hard , If you already know a bit about what you are looking for it helps. Its better than some I've found but could use improvement. If you are already familiar with the counting of strokes and radicals you should be able to work your way around this book.Does contain lots of usefull info along with the meaning and pronouciation of characters"
4,"if youre experienced, use this","I bought this book for $.60 with $3.99 shipping. I must say, that for that price I am extremely satisfied. Sure, this isn't the best Kanji Radical Dictionary out there, unless youre considering value. The usage isn't too hard to understand if you have used a kanji radical dictionary before. The online dictionaries are still much better. But, I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a kanji jisho."
1,Don't buy remanufactured products,"The DVD tray was not opened after pressing the open/close button.It was not tested properly as the basic function was not working.I am waiting for Amazon's reply to exchange this product. If i face the same type of problem in 2nd time then i will go for money back.I have received the 2nd item but the same prolem, the DVD didn't work. I will return both the items."
1,Junk,"I wish all these reviews were made prior to my purchase.When it arrived, it looked as if it had been in a war zone, but I kept it as it appeared to work. But after a few plays, I got similar problems to others here. Fortunately, Amazon's shipping back at their expense without hassle.Shame on Philips for trying to pass off such junk."
4,DVD & VCR combo review.,It was purchasd as a gift for my grandkids and I do not know much about it. Their parents said it works nice and plays all their DVDs and tapes. They are happy so I am happy.
5,DVD VCR Combo,I can't really describe how I feel because I haven't been able to figure out how to use it. I really haven't taken the time to learn.
1,Wrong edition,"The kindle edition is actually the seventeenth edition, not the eighteenth as it states and shows in the picture... Absolutely terrible."
3,Fine book,"This book is pretty informative, though it's more like a text book than I thought it would be. Dry and without any real philosophical perspective, there's lots of information but little in the way of insight, imo. For my taste, history is about putting things into context and extrapolating insight from past events. This book doesn't go that far, just a recitation of events in the past."
2,Used to think it was good...,"The ingredients in this product have high toxicity ratings: [...]I have switched to using Badger sunscreen, and it works really well and doesn't leave me with that sunscreen feeling:Badger All Natural Sunscreen, SPF 30, Unscented 2.9 oz (87 g). It is a bit greasy, but it doesn't bother me cause it moisturizes my skin as well, and I don't have to wash the sunscreen on and slather on moisturizer afterwards."
3,Odd sizing,I ordered these in Medium and I wear a womens 9-9 1/2. They are HUGE on the shoe but the opening to put your foot through is quite small. I had my husband try it on over his mens size 13 and it fit on his shoe!
3,Bowling slippers,"They are kinda stiff in the back and rub my ankle.I really needed a smaller size but, they weren't offered. However they suit the purpose."
3,BIG DOGS,I ORDERED THESE IN PINK AS PART OF MY SISTER'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT. OTHER ONLINE REVIEWS SAID THEY RAN SMALL SO I ORDERED A MEDIUM FOR MY SISTER WHO USUALLY WEARS A SIZE 7 SHOE. THEY'RE WAY TOO BIG - I WISHED I HAD ORDERED A SMALL. THEY WORK JUST FINE BUT DON'T FIT SNUG AT ALL. SHE LOOKS LIKE A CLOWN WHEN SHE PUTS THESE BIG PINK MONSTERS ON HER FEET TO GO POTTY.
4,Finally got to see it,"Not going to review the movie itself, just the hi-def quality. I found the quality to be excellent. The movie was sharp and clear and the colors were excellent. Dark scenes looked fine to me but dark scenes will always look less spectacular than bright scenes. The sound quality was great too. Sorry for such a short review but I just wanted to post for those that may have gotten the impression the image quality might not live up to full high-def standards when it clearly does."
4,Perhaps to be inproved in subsequent editions,"This book is a solid basis for a course in statistical mechanics. Since it was a first edition, there were many typographical errors that made some of the reading a little sketchy in parts. IF you have the patientence to sit down and derive some of the more important results that Kadanoff glosses over, you will greatly benefit from the book. It is a solid book, complete in it's presentation of the material. At time his notation can be a bit unorthordox and can take getting used to, especially for those who are more strict in their ""mathematical hygene."" One very nice features of the book is that the level of the problems lends themselves very well to a course. In other words an instructor won't have to make up his/her own pwoblems for the most part."
3,OTHER VIDEO BIOGRAPHIES ARE BETTER,"This isn't a full Callas documentary. It centers upon her final operatic projects on stage - Tosca at Covent Garden, the Met and Norma in Paris. Nothing is objectionable here - it's factual and well presented, and many classic B/W still photographs have been ""animated"" in a 3-D sort of way. Anyone who wants to see the complete Act Two of Tosca is directed toward the EMI DVD called ""At Covent Garden 1962-1964"". As far as Callas video biographies go, you'd be better off with the first one produced shortly after her death and hosted by Zefirrelli (on Allegro), one entitled ""Life and Art"" that is available on EMI, and Tony Palmer's somewhat overdramatic ""La Divinia"" (on Image Entertainment). I was hoping that the A&E Biography of Callas produced on cable a few years ago would be produced on video, but it hasn't."
2,Not worthy of Callas the artist,"This ""documentary"" merely rehashes a lot of the old clichés that have only clouded the artist that Callas was. It goes to all sorts of lengths to squeeze Callas' life story into the story of Tosca, a role which Callas despised, even thoug she was famous for that role. The only redeeming features of this DVD are several of the comments by Bumbry, Domingo, and a few others who actually speak of Callas the musican and artist. More than anything, however, this film does the same disservice to Callas that ""Master Class"" did: it drowns Callas the musician and artist in the drama of her personal life."
3,"Mounting tape is terrible, and large bumps knock it apart","As usual, the double sided tape doesn't hold very long. Silicone is the way to go. Also, some trips (it's mounted in a double axle camping trailer) the lid falls off. Somehow the napkins stay in it, so it's not a big deal to snap it back on, but it would be nice if it stayed."
1,Save your money.,A rehash of other movies but this one was really bad. No name actors who could not act. No plot and poor CGI
1,RedskinRich,"I thought I was getting a half-way descent flick. Both Netflix and Blockbuster gave it 2-1/2 stars. This was a total disappointment! I would have done better playing tiddly-winks with the neighborhood dog. The sound effects from the aliens were the same as ""War of the Worlds"". I've seen better acting at the local first graders after school play in the cafeteria! TWENTY THUMBS DOWN, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
1,One thing already killed the movie for me,"It's the constant white light blinking and flashing that made me look away from the screen each and every time producers used it as a special effect. What kind of cheap, crappy special effect is this? It isn't even a special effect! Why on earth would anyone use an annoying blinking screen that doesn't let you see what happens in the movie, irritate your eyes, brain and everything else? It would be okay, if they used it only once or twice but not each and every time they had to show that there is a warfare going on! The rest is unimportant. Bad acting, bad plot, bad special effects and there is nothing good about the movie. Nothing at all! Whoever gave the movie a good rating isn't a consumer of the product. Thank you very much for advertising your own product with false reviews but it sucks in every way. Thank you, but no thank you!"
4,Lowepro Vertex 300 AW Backpack,"This pack was larger than I expected. The shoulder and waist straps being somewhat heavy duty and kind of bulky. However I updated from a Slingshot 200 which was quite small and upon loading up the Vertex 300 AW found it to be about perfect.My only complaint--and, really, this is being a little petty--is that it seems really heavy [I have a Canon 5D and a couple lenses] and this is without a laptop in it. Maybe my camera equipment is heavier than I realized? I also wondered if the should/waist straps could be less substantial so when zipped up might allow the bag to be lower profile.The above questions are less criticism than curiosity as I realize a good camera deserves/requires something more substantial to protect it. Considering the price of the Slingshot 200 the Vertex 300 AW is quite reasonably priced.Yuri [[...]]"
5,Great Knives,All 3 knives feel balanced & cut beautifully. I cut a pineapple as if it was butter.....
1,Can I give it 0 stars?? Save your money,"Not one ""original"" idea that I havent seen in every magazine or craft book for years. Most of the items were scrapbooking related, which was little things like tags and noting worth duplicating.I love Gooseberry Patch, especially their Christmas books (I own them all), but this one has no originality, no spark, nothing that is worth even trying to do for a project. Usually there is at least ONE project that has me excited and running to the craft store, but this one was just boring and dull.Save your money and just check it out at the library."
4,Everything you need for a homespun holiday,"Great gift ideas and recipes, beautifully photographed and illustrated."
5,great retro crafts!,i bought the book for the crafts from vintage linens--beautiful. the food doesn't look bad either.
3,Over-priced,"In my opinion, this book is overpriced. I have not finished reading it, but I have a general feeling so far that a book going for US$ 45 has to deliver. It does not matter whether it is a hard-copy. The book has some incomplete sentences, something I honestly did not expect considering the level it is targeted for - well-read business executives, etc.That said, it gives what I think is useful information for someone in hurry."
3,Powerful Bass and a Unique Sound.,This CD will make your Subwoofer's rock. A well put together Album.
2,People are awful and this movie is now too.,"I saw Zorba 40 years ago in my 'Greek period' and loved the film.Now I feel nothing but revulsion.Revulsion against the Greek villagers who are medieval, evil,murderous and pillaging. -not very inviting for the tourist industry.Revulsion against the British coward for not defending his woman or at least shielding her.Revulsion against the Greek crook who dances his troubles away.Revulsion against a technical DVD fiasco which made my memories even more painful.Remaons the beautiful theme music and there was too little of it."
2,ZZZ-Orba the Greek,This film never really engaged me. The plot in a nutshell is earthy peasent teaches life lessons to uptight Brit. Anthony Quinn could have gotten a patent playing these earthy (name the ethnicity) foreign types. Alan Bates plays the stiff upper-lipped Brit. Throw in a dying French prostitute for a little melodrama. The story just meandered if it wasn't resorting to well-worn cliches. Two pluses for the movie is the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and a great music score.
5,FOR YOU LIFE....,"This is a movie that can't be explained with words... but I'll try:Zorba is the greatest character in the movie's story and Quinn's carrer. Niko Kazazakis crete a iluminated story for a iluminated man... Zorba is what all human beeing sHould be. espontaneous, lovely and sincere!THE WORLS NEED MORE ZORBAS.. AND EVERYONE MUST SEE THIS FILM ONCE IN A LIFETIME!I LOVE YOU ALL"
4,Really good in its time...,"If one could find another Anthony Quinn to play the role of Zorba this is a movie that deserves a 21st Century refilming. Unfortunately, Quinn really IS Zorba and it would be hard to create a new identity for Zorba. Quinn actually ""channels"" Zorba. Too bad the film is so dated!"
5,Where is the soul Mr. Zorba!!,"I watched this movie with great expectation. I first came across Zorba in a book of Osho. I must say that movie does not disappoint. The message of the movie is quite clear ""be a bit crazy, don't take life too seriously"", And I agree with that completely. Drink, eat and be merry. But the problem with this approach start getting clear as you watch, and it is here I think the movie or the thought behind the movie lacks.How long one can avoid the question of his own existence, his identity. In this regards I like Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse which I think is an extension of Zorba.Be like Zorba, but be aware the life demands more than.Just add enlightenment to Zorba and you will get what Osho once called ""Zorba the Buddha"". That could be the best possible synthesis of a human being. Remember Mr. Zorba we need to have a heart towards other as well. Highly recommended!!"
1,Backhanded Racism At Its Finest,"I can't think of a finer example of the crypto-racism of the modern age than Zorba the Greek.In olden days, we used to just openly deride and indict certain cultures -- whether it was true or not -- as being corrupt and backward, and/or even subhuman. Nowadays we're not nearly so honest, and that's why so many of the world's problems only continue to get worse.Nowadays we portray all the corruption, backwardness, and even subhumanity of a given culture -- whether its true or not -- while also working into that depiction a despicable pretense of respect for that culture as being somehow merely ""quaint"" or ""life-affirming"". In this fashion, we romanticize and even encourage the proliferation of cultural toxicity.Ah, this backhanded racism that is liberal racist ""multi-culturalism"". If you've just recently ingested poison or tainted clams and need a way to bring them back up again, I couldn't think of a better emetic remedy than Zorba the Greek."
4,Zorba is absorbing,"I cannot imagine Greeks would have been very happy with this portrayal of island life when it was released. But then Cacoyannis was a Cypriot.It is a stretch, but the movie reminds me of Michael Lewis's analysis of the Greek monastery's land speculation in the 2000s and the Greek financial debacle. That wasn't very flattering either."
5,excellent product,"The DVD Zorba The Greek, a movie that symbolized my youthful awakening of the way to live... an aspect of an important element of my essence, then and now it continues to speak to me.Zorba, with Anthony Quinn, Alan Bates, and Irene Papas all give excellent portrayals of a study in three contrasting characterizations of freedom, cerebral/intellectual, and the culturally familiar standard of female powerlessness, saved and protected by men. The themes are timeless as are the actors' brilliant performances.I still love this film and find it fresh after all these years. The black and white feel of authenticity for old world time still thrills me.Happy to own this treasure and symbol from my youth."
4,Zorba the Greek Revisited,"Through Amazon, this wonderful old film was brought back to life for me by way of modern technology. This meant the quality of the film was excellent which added just that much more to the enjoyment of this very moving story - without doubt, one of our film classics.It also meant that I was able to show it to friends who had not seen the film at the time of its release and so share the enjoyment that I first had many years ago.We take modern technology so much for granted in this modern era, but when you consider I was able to purchase this film on CD for only a little over $20, it is truly remarkable.Keep going Amazon. You are carrying out a great service through your business."
4,Full Screen Idiocy,Why on earth are they releasing the DVD for this great film in Full Screen. Haven't people gotten used to wide screen yet? I don't want to see 65% of a film when the director meant me to see 100%. The company releasing this needs to have its head examined.
4,Zorba the Greek,This was a good movie. I believe it was differents in that the good guys did not win in this movie.
5,One of the all time greats!,Anthony Quinn was an actor who could play virtually any part. This may have been his best performance ever. Love Tony (Anthony) Quinn. He was an outstanding actor and is sorely missed. RIP TONY!
2,Vastly out of date,"I hate to say that this was one of my favorite films when I was in my twenties.Now. with much more experience under my belt, I listen to Zorba's answer about whether he has ever been married, which is (from memory), ""Yes, wife, house, kids, the full catastrophe!"" And my older & wiser self automatically raises two questions: (1) Most people consider a wife and family to be the best of good fortune, and (2) Where are these people, now that you have obviously abandoned them, to become a Life Force of the Greek Peasantry?The rest of this movie is no better, and goes straight downhill when the Life Force of the Greek Peasantry begins having affairs with women.It retains some small interest as one more attempt to justify the idea that ""I am free to do whatever I want whenever I want,"" a thought that is absurd even in Calvin & Hobbes cartoons."
4,Zorba the Greek,"Anthony Quinn is at his very best in Zorba the Greek. If you like Quinn, you will certainly enjoy this movie. He plays a heart warming, yet an uncouth and unkempt character, constantly in pursuit of wine, women and song. He captures the very essence of his character.Crete is portrayed as a brutal and intolerant place, where neither law or decency seem to exist. Murder is socially acceptable and there is no governmental authority.The plot of the movie just made me scratch my head and wonder where it was going and why? The movie has no clear message to portray. Further, it is unclear why the movie was made, unless it was simply to showcase Quinn."
5,Very good indeed,Found and was able to purchase a DVD I had not found locally. It arrived very fast. Thank YOU!!!
4,The Reason My Son likes the Train Set,"This battery-powered engine is the key to my son's fun with his new train set. He enjoys watching Thomas pull bunches of cars around the track. When Thomas slows down on the hill, it's a lesson in ""The Little Engine That Could"". It could be easier to replace the battery, but other than that, a great toy!"
3,Ditch this,"Good content, but what it lacks is readability. The information is haphazardly stream of consciousness. Also Girardian heresy begins to sneak in during the discussion of the nature of Christ's death."
5,Excellent Book,"This book is part of a series of Cassell works on war. The series is rather hit and miss, with some (like the 17th Century one) being good and others (like the 18th century one), being quite bad. However, I did enjoy this one, which covered several different perspectives and types of conflict. There was a good use of maps and charts which is important, and the writing was good.Recommended."
3,"Poland, Russia, Scandinavia, etc. did not exist in the Renaissance!","You won't find Poland, Russia, or any of the Scandinavian countries in the index: none of these active Renaissance combatants are mentioned in this text at all! (This seems typical of too many 'Anglo-Saxon 'raised military authors who seem content to peruse the vast British Imperial War Museum - thinking that source alone sufficient write the world's military history for everybody.) I suppose one can justify these 'omissions' by claiming that Sweden, Poland, and Muscovy, etc. did not participate in the thick of changes defining/redefining warfare throughout 15th-17th centuries. (However, I am not assuming that until I've first 'confirm' this elsewhere!) Nonetheless, an accessible and enjoyable book that that aptly describes (and illustrates) the changing technical 'iconography' of warfare: this complex collage is always a difficult historical task, as compared with other more stable periods."
5,"Excellent Survey of the Period, from a Military Standpoint","I Suppose the title says it all. This book IS a bit of a survey book, painting in broad strokes. But what strokes they are! The author covers the period's major conflicts, the evolution of warfare both ofensive and defensive, technical and theoretical. Really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone wanting a good look at the period without being loaded with details. Details are here, but not so many as to put you to sleep or overwhelm. Read it!"
2,"Fly astounding, Fly 2 is terrible","MAN, I hope they release The Fly separately from Fly 2. I lovedGoldblum's Fly, one of the creepiest, most intense horror movies of all time, but the sequel is just trash - why did they have to slap this junk on the same DVD as a classic? Guess I'll wait for the solo Fly, if there is one... (Rating 5 stars for THE FLY, no stars for FLY II= two stars overall)"
4,"The Fly Dersves Better DVD treatment, Swat Part 2","David Cronenberg masterfully remade ""The Fly"" into one of the best horror films of the 1980s. Shocking, repulsive, and disturbing, yet a love story, a character study, and a whole lot of social commentary all rolled into one great movie. Jeff Goldblum is in top form as the mad scientist. Geena Davis is equally effective as his casual girlfriend caught in his ""web"" of deceit, lies, and terror. Truly scary at times, always thought provoking. The DVD is very plain, and derserves a better treatment all on its own. Now for Part 2, well it simply emphasizes the grossness of the first. Eric Stoltz tries too hard to replicate Goldblum to no avail. The plot is predictable, and basically turns into a typical monster movie from Roger Corman with a big budget. Very lame. Still, the price is well worth it even if you only watch part one."
2,By the numbers sequel to a great film,"The Fly II is a clealry by the numbers sequel to a great film. When I say by the numbers I mean more gore, less story, more action, weak acting. Eric Stoltz does an okay job in the lead role but to me Stoltz has always been more of a serious actor and he seems lost in this film. Just check it out if you wanna see gore otherwise be afarid, be very afarid."
3,Trying too hard...,"To be honest, the plot of the film is very interesting and intriguing. Both movies have wise ends, but hold on - they have tried too hard. Theyve turned a good plot into a pool of blood, guts, pus etc...If there was to be less gore and blood and all the other things that make you pause the movie to go to the bathroom to throw up every 5 minutes, the movie would have been, in my opinion, a success."
1,A bona-fide celluloid disaster.,"This film illustrates the common claim that sequels almost never live up to the standards set by the original. From start to finish, _The Fly II_ revels in mutilation (animal and human), graphic violence, and numbing degradation. If the last few scenes don't make you lose your lunch, then nothing will.With no original redeeming qualities that I could spot, this is the sort of rubbish that gives science fiction a bad name."
4,the dvd of the year,this is was a great dvd that I watched a few times I got a duplicate order and2008 was a good year for the movie industry even though the original vhs and laserdisk came out in 1989the film was greatly restored for a 23 year old movie
4,WOW! It's like you buy THE FLY and get the sequel free.,"..I say this because this DVD is at such an affordable price. You get The Fly (1986) on one side of the DVD and THE FLY II (1989) on the other side. Both presented in widescreen and 5.1 surround sound. The Fly stars Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. It's a horrific horror classic with gory award worthy effects. Goldblum is superb as the hidious title character, his gittering and effective nervous system failure is amazing to watch. The last 30 minutes are not for those with a weak stomach. However if you make it that far your likely to be alright. The Fly II stars Eric Stolz in what was a somewhat disappointing sequel. There are just so many things that just wouldn't have went down the way they did. The Lab/Scientist seemed so unprofessional, it was hard to take them seriously. On the upside the make-up and some of the special effects were pretty good. Over all the two movies together make for a very good double feature."
4,The Fly / Fly 2,I have enjoyed this remake of the classic. It adds an interesting twist to the original story.
1,The Fly II,"Amazon is characteristically mixing these reviews between Fly I & II (or the disc with both). The one star is for #2. Fly #1 was very good. #2 is, well... #2. What bugs me is the shallow storyline and cliche cardboard characters. Just another arthropod with an axe to grind flying around with violence and vomit. If you want some nice gore in a good flick, watch The Thing again!"
5,LOVE!!!,"This book was sooooooo amazing!!!!! Absolutely need to read! This girl in the book is funny, pretty, and smart what more could you want? The man in this book was handsome, super tough, and amazing all the way around. Get this book wont regret!"
4,Another great Dark book,"I truly enjoyed reading this book as I have all the Dark series books. Since quite a few reviewers explained the gist of the storyline, I won't, but suffice it to say that Ms. Feehan has amazingly created an entire race that is fasinating to read about and the passion in these books is phenomenal. I doubt I'll ever get tired of this storyline. However, I must agree with the reviewer from St. Paul, MN that the narrative referring to Tempest as Rusti was somewhat disconcerting & I also found it odd that someone as ""old world"" as Darius would repeatedly use the endearment ""honey"" - but these are minor complaints and I certainly did enjoy this book and look forward to her next Carpathian story."
1,Redundancy is a bad thing . . .,"Let's see . . . sex, sex, and more sex . . . Oh, and did I mention sex? And, ""Oh, I'm a beautiful, fiercely independent heroine who is unaware of my own stupidity. But I don't need to be taken care of.""""Yes, and I'm your big, strong, sexually irresistible MAN who can't keep it in my pants. I won't ever let you out of my sight at the risk of seeming like an overbearing, overprotective warden, because I don't want to trust anyone with you, my delicate beautiful flower.""Gawd! Could this GET any more stupid? This novel is the same thing over and OVER!!! The protagonists are nothing new and neither is the strife between them. This is nothing you haven't read before. You should probably check this out at a library first. Good thing it was on sale when I bought it."
1,PAINFUL READ,"It took everything in me to finish this book and not put it down. This has to be one of the worse books I have read in a long time. If I had to read ""honey or baby"" one more time I was going to rip all the pages out. Darius was a overbearing you know what but at the same time Tempest/Rusti was just a plain ol dummy. If someone told me don't go over there because it's very dangerous why am I going to go, just stupid. I could have read a little more about Barack and Syndil. The one star is for the love scene that was the only thing worth while. I even got tired of that."
1,Disappointing and poorly written,"After the good reviews for this series and this title, I was truly disappointed. I forced myself to get through half of it to give it a chance, but I will not finish it. The point of view in this book is so unstable that I don't believe the author is familiar with the concept. About three pages into any book on romance writing the reader is cautioned against ""headhopping."" Ms Feehan has not read any of these books. We can be in two characters heads in the same paragraph. And two more in the next. Oh, and get this: we have a ""the eagles are coming"" moment in this book. Sigh. And a ""warm cave in the bowels of the earth"" behind a waterfall. With sparkly diamonds in the walls and hundreds of candles that he left there just knowing he'd need them? Purple prose, repetition, too stupid to live heroine, cliches, this book can provide it all."
4,Best so far...,"This was the best of the Dark books by far. Darius's character had more depth than the other heros of Feehan's novels. I am a huge fan of the entire series, but found the storyline more compelling in Dark Fire. You feel a genuine attraction to Darius and respect the way he deals with Tempest. I would recommend that someone read all of this series, but Dark Fire stands alone with an intricate plotline and great charater description."
1,Testosterone and the Twit,"You know, Ms Feehan has actually written some good books. This isn't one of them. The plot is mimimal at best, the bad guys don't inspire anything other than yawns, there is no interesting conflict between the characters, and the characters themselves ... Darius is badly drawn (a mishmash of old world domineering and contemporary American slang), and Rusti/Tempest is stupid. I honestly can't think of a better word for it. She's in constant revolt against authority for pretty much no reason (some back story would help here), she's incapable of logic or self preservation (gee, I know the bad guys are out to get me, but I think I'll go wander off alone to where I've just been told the bad guys are because Darius wants me to stay with someone who can protect me), she can't even keep a simple promise. Pick any of the other books in the Dark series, and give this one a miss."
3,romance reader,"Although I like the ""Dark"" series, this one seems to drag a bit in the middle. It's still a good read though. If you've read her other books, then this one may seem like the same old stuff. A Carpathian male meets his independent lifemate and they stuggle with his dominance and her independence. I would have liked them to have more dialoge other than Darius telling her what to do and Tempest saying no. Tempest also is unable to get herself out of trouble without Darius's help. Can't she figure out her own problems without Darius's help?"
3,Exciting,The erotic parts are exciting to read but they could use a little less repeating of the same Lifemate ritual and male ego chatter to stretch out the book. This is my third pass through Christine Feehan's Dark series books until her new hardcover is a paperback. I would like to read more action with couple participation and more female power like Desari had. I do like the female rights struggle but I get impatient with the slap at female's intelligence by having Rusti repeat stupid decisions of going out alone during dangerous times.
5,Feehan's Finest,"I am a fan of Christine Feehan's ""Dark"" series, and this is definitely one of my favorite stories. Very well written and a good value, if you buy the e-reader edition."
4,Dark FIre,This has been one of the greatest book that I have read in a very long time. It kept me reading until the very end. I would recommend this read to us all.
3,Dark Fire,"Not bad but certainly not her best. I too was hoping for a reunion with the original gang; they are the caracters we love... Most of the book is about the exchanges between Darius, leader of the new group and Tempest their new mecanic (what a weird name!). ""Light to his darkness"" and such but with a little bit more of real dialog than the last book had (Dark Challenge). One very good point is the little time it took Darius to dispose of the bad guys. No endless fight in this book... Still I can t wait to follow Gregory's story once more..."
3,"Not a romance, but a romance writer","Romance novels are a repetitive genre -- the same things happen, but the details change slightly; namely, the girl's name, the guy's name and profession, etc.If you're after a series with continued character development, and more and deeper revelations about the vampire universe, this isn't it. This is a romance series, with a fairly original formula: Guy Carpathian finds gifted human soulmate, who after resisting him, leads him to redemption. Guy Carpathian saves her from bad guys a couple of times. It's a pretty good formula, but the books are _strictly_ formula. Even the love scenes are basically identical from book to book.So if you want depth/character development/insight with some romance, you should avoid these, and stick to J.D. Robb, Laurell Hamilton and Charlaine Harris. But Feehan is writing romances around a unique formula. If you like formula romances, you will probably enjoy these greatly."
1,Dark Dumbness,This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read.The characters and situation are not very believable.The writing skills are very poor except when the sex scenes arrive.There it goes into to much and detail and reduces the book from 2 star to 1 star.The filthiest book I have ever read and will read.I was deeply unimpressed by this book and how it got to be a best-seller amazes me.
5,Another Outstanding Dark Series Book,"I loved Dark Fire. As always, C. Feehan wraps you up in the emotions and relationships of the main characters. Darius is strong, possessive and at the same time gentle and caring. I fell in love with him immediately. Tempest is his perfect match, strong and gutsy but filled with love and compassion. I was on the couple's side 100% and could not wait until the end of the novel to see the end results. This book rates as high as Dark Prince. Loved It..."
3,Pop standards fall slightly flat,"I expected more from this, one of a handful of Willie Nelson albums dedicated to songs from the Great American Songbook. The songs are great, Booker T. is onboard for production and organ duties, and Willie's voice sounds great. Still, the emotion that makes Stardust a great collection of standards just isn't working here.""Without A Song"", ""Harbor Lights"", and, to a lesser extent, some of the others, make nice (dare I say ""easy"") listening. I could've done without Julio Iglesias' presence on the flat ""As Time Goes By"", and much of the album is lacking in energy. Even Booker T.'s organ serves to lay a bland background as ballad after ballad is served up.The disc is inexpensive and makes inobtrusive background music. Beyond that, I'd go with Stardust or the Leon Russell collaboration for Willie Nelson doing standards."
5,"Love, Love, Love",CD was advertised as used and came in excellent condition. Very happy with this item.
1,Shlock Shop,Willie Nelson's best albums of the eighties were collaborations with another artist: Webb Pierce or Hank Snow. This one stinks.
1,Not appropriate for young children!,"This adaptation opens with children frolicking in the bucolic countryside of Portugal. It seems innocent enough, but beware. After the apparition of Mary occurs, the tone of the piece soon becomes evil and sinister. The parents of the children are dark and threatening, berating them and denouncing them for embarrassing the family. It gets worse! The children are hauled to municipal court, where they are threatened by dark and twisted officials that if they do not recant, they will be boiled alive in oil. As another reviewer mentioned, there is also a vision of hell that will give little ones nightmares. Is this wholesome family entertainment? I think not! The story could have been presented in a much more age appropriate way!"
5,Solid recipes and top-notch presentation,"Currently buying a copy as a Christmas gift, and I couldn't resist writing a few words....My wife bought this book when it first came out, and it has since made a wonderful addition to our collection. The dishes that we have concocted following these recipes have all been truly wonderful. Furthemore, each chapter contains interesting narrative to fill in additional color behind the origins of the Latin fare presented. Cooking is a true passion in our household, and this book succeeds at kindling the fire."
1,Pretentious Mess,"Sorry, but like most latinas I did not grow up going to polo matches and rifling through photos of my grandmother in luxurious ballgowns. This book was a pretentious mess. It is also full of errors, such as the one on page 212, referring to Brazilian Moqueca, a stew:""...it is reminiscent of Paella but with African and Portuguese influences"". Actually Moqueca is mostly an African dish, with subtle Native American and European (Spanish/Portuguese) influences, not the other way around. If you get this book you will lose your appetite because the author put glamour shots of herself on every other page and frankly, I would rather look at the taco bell chihuahua."
1,HIGHLY OVER RATED,"I TOTALLY disagree, that this is a wonderful book...highly over rated...go with something from Rick Bayless or Diane Kennedy...AND AFTER SEEING THEM ON EMERIL LIVE, MADE ME GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT, AFTER REVIEWING IT(I READ A COPY FROM THE LIBRARY BEFORE BUYING COOKBOOKS)...TWO PHONY, IRRITATING, SELF INDULGED, ANNOYING *****!THEY ONLY THINK THEY ARE CHIC..BUT AREN'T!"
4,not the best horny horns cd but,"okay when I first heard this in 1995 I slept on this but understood why fred wesley himself thought gc should hav e left this in the vault now after hearing it again i can tolerate it a little better but the first 2 horny horns cd's are better but if you like fred, and maceo you still gotta cop this. cookie monster is a smash and lickety slpit is extended with fred going baserk on trombone and love those basslines by bootsy and tyrone lampkin goes for his on drums. oh I don't think sew is the instrumental version of funkadelic's oh I it's cool and fallen off the edge is okay not enough horns though and you mainly hear bernie worrell on clavinet clearly bernie has did better. still a musthave for p funk collectors."
5,True Honky Punk!,"as lead singer of the unknown group THE HONKY PUNKS I can say that SHILOH LINDSEY IS A GODDESS.. with one of the most pure voices in country music today and an unforgiving attitude in her lyrics her voice and her style..she has sang backup on a couple Honky Punks song and is appearing on my other band DARK HUMOR's upcoming album..I think SHILOH ranks up there with the likes of LORETTA LYNN, LUCINDA WILLIAMS and dare I say even HANK WILLIAMS SRI'd love to hear Shiloh and HAnk III do a duet.. but just her voice alone makes her an icon in my eyes.."
3,Not what I expected....just okay.,As hard as it was to find this CD I was not very impressed with all the hoopla attached to this artist. Some of the songs were okay but it seems like just an updated copy of Lucinda Williams type songs. I like Lucinda a lot so I thought I'd give this one a try. Unfortunately I ordered her second CD but this has not arrived yet. I listened to For My Smoke once and then again to see if I missed something. I was not impressed. Still I like where she is coming from as an artist. Maybe she'll get it all together for her third one.I do see her potential.
3,"Not the best, but fine","In a few words: Maazel shows a personal idea of each work in this album, and that is commendable. The orchestra sounds pure and committed to the task. As for Mrs. Meier... well, her voice sounds bad; she tries to give emotion, though. If you are going to make a first approach to these works, move swiftly to another version. If this is going to be one among many others, go for it."
2,"Meier isn't at her best, and Maazel is as usual","Waltraud's reputation as a dramatic actress in the opera house extends to her ability to dramatize Mahler's songs, but even so, there are big problems here, beginning with the conductor. Maazel made a premium-priced cycle of Mahler symphonies on Sony with the matchless Vienna Phil, but even they couldn't salvage wayward performances that were savaged by the critics (except for the Fourth, which rather oddly became a critics' darling). Maazel is glib, shallow, and stiff in Mahler, three defects that are fatal. They certainly prove to be here, and Meier's rather curdled voice is no friend to Mahler's rich emotionality either. Despite many touches of artistry, I simply don't find her right in Mahler, either in these song cycles or in Das Lied von der Erde. Meier's many fans will feel free to disagree."
3,Not the best book of mission furniture,"After reading Blair Howard's ""Arts and Crafts Furniture"", I was expecting a lot from this book and it didn't deliver. I agree with all of Donald Thomson's complaints above. The joinery seemed questionable and he took short cuts I would not have made. Additionally, I felt his pieces lacked the elegance that the better mission designs have, both by Stickley and by others. However, the book is very detailed and easy to follow, so it should be easy for a beginning woodworker to follow. Joining boards and cutting mortices appeared to be the most advanced things he ever did, and he avoided cutting mortice and tenon joints whenever possible."
3,Recommend it but did not love it,"I loved the premise of this novel from its description. It seemed an interesting way to connect with people from different walks of life and to show how easy it can be to create a great adventure.The book was interesting and due to the book I have even tried to ""googlewhack"". It was also interesting that so many people were open to meeting the author in his googlewhack search.However, the book was not quite as humorous as I would have expected. There were some great lines, but not enought to hold my interest.Worth a read nonetheless."
5,Inspired rollercoaster,"Dave Gorman's Googlewhack adventure is an inspired rollercoaster. And like all roller coasters it is thrilling, unexpected and scares the be'jesus out of you.Dave takes the ennui of getting into your thirties, with all its responsibility avoiding tricks, and draws it out into the extreme.Whilst many of us may have painted the kitchen to avoid getting on with what we're meant to be doing, Dave is probably unique in jetting all over the world many times over to achieve the same effect.Horrifyingly he seems intent on destroying his life throughout the tale - thank God he got a book out of it!"
4,Everithing OK. Thank You,I have receive the DVD on time by courier. I put it in the DVD player and works perfectly. Thank you very much.
4,Good book,"Yes, it's a good book. Many interesting informations, very practical (except 1 or 2 chapters), lot of good ideas and common sense (and in the world of merger, it's not that common). Even at such a high price, it's still worth the investment."
3,Opened my mind to the possibilities,"Chariots of the Gods mentioned so many things that I'd never heard before, it was astounding! The book also got me thinking more about the great pyramids in egypt. How were they built more than 4,000 years ago when we can't even produce them today? Questions like that opened my mind to wonders I'd never imagined. That said, I still have doubts about his theory. What would advanced aliens need these things for? I can't imagine. Perhaps an ancient civilization existed before recorded history instead."
2,"If primative people were so stupid, how did we advance to here?","This is an interesting work, from a highly discredited author. While he is a very good storyteller, once you leave the web of his writing he theories dissolve quickly. According to his key rational, all 'primitive' people were stupid - so how else could they have built great wonders but with the help of aliens. But if our ancestors were so unintelligent, how did we every progress to where technology is today? Did the aliens make many repeat visits? Read this for an interesting look into one man's theories following the boom of space travel, but then look at the theories for what they are - incredible unsubstantiated."
1,Bad research; Erroneous conclusions,"I won't mince words here: this book represents a flight of fancy on the part of the author. If you have some background in the social sciences (in particular, archaeology), then you might read this book for laughs. But if you are seriously interested in ancient civilizations, where they came from, and what happened to them, I HIGHLY recommend you begin with a serious book, such as one written by Brian Fagan. Von Daniken's book is pseudo-science - it is tantalizing, inspiring, even bewitching, but so is a fantasy novel. The only difference is that good fantasy writers don't claim that their work is nonfiction. Von Daniken has made a lot of money cooking up this nonsense - don't send him any more. Borrow it from your public library. And most important of all: READ CRITICALLY!"
3,not the first,Erich has done a good job of introducing the idea of alians as the early gods - to the masses. However - please disregard the editorial - EVD was not the first!Lobsang Rampa was saying this back in the fifties - with more detail!!
1,This book needs to go in the FICTION section.,"I bought into this book hook, line and sinker (and the movie) as a child. THen I grew up and learned that everything you read isn't the truth.It's been proven the author manufactured artifacts (they even found the artisan who made a few of of them aftre being paid).Anyone considering reading this book or seeing the documentary should read the book Crash go the Chariots and other books that pick apart Von Daniken's work point by point.It does make fascinating reading but it's largely fiction. He twists facts. Leaves out anything that even remotely refutes his theories and as mentioned before manufactured 'evidence' where none existed.A bullet hole in a 40,000 year old Bison skull? How laughable is that?THis book IS valuable in that it can be used a teaching tool to show students they shouldn't believe everything they read.Every year some 'scientist' announces he's found Atlantis. Because of von Daniken I'v learned not to take such reports at face value."
1,Read This Years Ago,"I read this when it first came out. It's a hoax. If you want far-fetched, eat it with mustard. At least then it won't taste so bad."
2,Psuedo Archaeology at its Best,"Come on people. I only read this book because he is the classic example of bad archaeology at its best. He only looks at a hand full of the evidence and makes up stories to fit it. For example in this book, The pictures of pottery he has with Flying Saucers on there, he has admited to being [unreal].This book is is a sweeping attack on the memories and abilities of ancient peoples. Von Däniken claims that the myths, arts, social organizations, etc., of ancient cultures were introduced by astronauts from another world. He questions not just the capacity for memory, but the capacity for culture and civilization itself, in ancient peoples. Prehistoric humans did not develop their own arts and technologies, but rather were taught art and science by visitors from outer space.Does this sound a little toooooooo [unbeliveable] for you."
1,How is this guy still selling books?,"This is pure pseudo-science, one that in spite of being thoroughly debunked over 20 years still manages to attract overtrusting and gullible readers. I have to hand it to this guy that such pure unadulterated fiction, although advertised as fact, continues to sell books. Don't know the particulars as to why he was jailed for embezzlement, one would think that the revenues from this book alone would have made him rich for life."
4,"Entertaining, even if flawed","Judging by all the reviews, this book has obviously polarized readers for decades. However, despite all the criticisms and detractions, few can deny the power of Daniken's provokative theories. As a critical thinker who is open-minded, but not gullible, I have to say that I really enjoyed the read, and am glad to have a copy of Chariots of the Gods on my bookshelf. Even if you discard half of what passes as evidence in this book, it is hard to deny that at least a portion of the information presented invites further questions, and merits further research. So, at the very least, I give it a positive rating because of the entertainment factor, and for the conversation-starter that it is ;)"
3,A Review on the DVD release...,"Hi Ho from Melbourne (Aust)...Just a short note, I decided to buy this program on DVD mainly because of the Sound Track since I couldn't find it on CD. Well what can I say, the picture quality is acceptable but ""boy oh boy"" what happened to the sound!, the naration is ok, but I like to pay attention to the sound track in most films but the music in this DVD release was terrible to say the least, the Wow and Flutter is so horrible that my 15 year old video recording off TV is awhole lot better!! If any more copys are to be made, please replace your master copy. And one other thing, if you want to be enlightend by Science and facts then do yourselves a favour and get Carl Sagan's ""COSMOS"" you wont be sorry....Clint (VK3CSJ)"
4,Interesting,"I think its an interesting way of looking at some of the unexplained events of the past cultures - If you want to read a book about ancient cultures then this not the book for you - but if your a little more adventurous and dont have a problem with accepting or at least suspending disbelief then try it - Its worth it - Another title on the same subject is a book called ""Gods of the new millenium"" by Alan F. Alford - this is a better book by all means and if you can get your hands on this one then you can truly appreciate what both the writers are trying to say - basically not for the weak minded - It gives you something to think about and you can bet its different."
4,Twilight of the Gods,"This movie is fascinating and inspiring, and not because any of it is true. The gorgeous photography and haunting musical score brought countless archaeological wonders to life and may have indirectly allowed them to survive by bringing their existence and peril to the attention of the world community. Von Daniken's theories constitute a sort of ""fake history"", not altogether different from the various conspiracy theories purporting to explain our complicated modern world, but his fake history was the catalyst that allowed American audiences to cultivate an interest in the treasures of vanished peoples.For me, this film constitutes a record of childhood wonder that was soon outgrown in the face of actual education and experience. Seeing the movie again has brought renewed respect for the ingenuity and artistic flair of the ancients. No ""extraterrestrials"" are needed to explain the richness of our cultural past."
5,Chariots of the Gods,This is a very interesting point of view. I really enjoyed reading it. There was points that gave me food for thought.
4,Speculations on UFOs: Hanging a lot on relatively little,"I first read this book when it came out, and it seemed much more impressive then. Today it comes across much weaker, with the author constantly stretching and reaching and hanging a lot on sometimes very little. But it still gives the reader food for thought about a lot of previously unexplained things, such as was the Earth visited by extraterrestrials, who left their mark in ancient architecture and even human genetics. This book is worth reading once, then being put down while the reader mulls things over, and then considered a second time."
2,Our ancestors did not need the help of aliens,"Our ancestors did not need the help of aliens to build the pyramids or to build Machu Picchu.Our ancestors (the Mayas, the Incas etc.) were good engineers. They had an advanced knowledge of hydrology, sustainable development, and structural design. None of this is mentioned in ""Chariots of the Gods"".A much better book on this subject is ""Machu Picchu: A Civil Engineering Marvel"", by Kenneth R. Wright and Alfredo Valencia Zegarra."
1,Chariots of the gods is absurd,"An absurd so-called documentary of far-fetched facts that are more fantasy than fact.Using the logic of this film,the Statue of Liberty could have been called an alien artifact with her ""space helmet"" and the ""computer"" in her hands.No,save your money,this is a con."
5,who ever thinks that this is wrong needs shut up,This book is really good i recomended it to any one who belives that thre is other living inteligense in the universe and to those that are not quite agreed with the bible for those who think thatthe god that the church talks about its not real enyoit cherrs
1,Grasshopper,"While the crossmen and the bronzemen were intriging, I feel I owe a debt to this fellow. For perhaps without his Bible quotations I may not have read the Bible for myself. I found his grasshopper approach alarming as I proceeded to read the entire chapter and then the book itself. My anger was that I had been lied to . I made a promise that before I died I would read the entire Bible for myself. That I would not trust another to interpret for me. In 3yrs. of carefull study I found out that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, the Christ. My associates still remind me to this day how I first preached the Chariots of the Gods, and sought to persuade them to this Mars approach. This is to my ignorance and shame. It still provokes laughter after more then 20yrs. So it is written, so let it be done. To hell with the guidelines."
1,Erich Von Daniken!,"I gave this book a single star because i lost my faith reading this book it is really great but it left me with allot of questions about my god now i don't really believe in god, i do allot i researching of my own now another thing i have really seen UFO's in my life and i don't know what they are and Erich V. Daniken brings some light to the situation!"
1,Did not receive my book,"Dear sirs: As I have talked to you before and the seller, I have not received my book. I attempted to use the guarantee but it is impossible to weave through that mess.I e-mailed the seller over one week ago but he did not respond. I need help to get my book or money back thank you"
2,it kinda sucked,I saw a program on History Channel that referred to the book so I bought it. The book sucked.I was hoping for some more in depth discussion on the topics listed but it didn't give any.
3,Just saying...,"At the front of the book it says ""This book is a work of fiction.Names Characters, places and incidents either are products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is coincidental.""Entertainment purposes only. And Sir Daniken's pockets are lined with bennies. I applaud him for fooling people into thinking it's real."
2,Chariots of the GODS,flaky without any substantiation to back up the hypothesis. Fun read. But aliens from outer space and one of these turns out to be God!
5,Very interesting book,I wanted this book after watching Ancient Aliens. The show talked about Erick Von Daniken's book a lot. So i purchased this book to get a better understanding. A lot of the facts that have been uncovered in this book will absolutely blow your mind. This is a must read!
1,I gave up after one chapter.,"This book might be alright, but every second sentence is a bitter and childlike dig at the scientific community who obviously at some point must have laughed at this guy so hard that he never forgave them. His theories may be right, but I just could not stand the twisted way he has written the book."
2,"Sincerely, I can't stand this Däniken anymore.","When Däniken, and defenders of the theory of the ancient astronauts have talked about their beliefs that the ancient gods were aliens, Ok, as an atheist and physicist I think I can digest this.But when we watch some of them on History Channel saying that the aliens were created by some kind of god too, oh come on, this is laughable to say the least.To me, some of them(the dumb ones) are trying to replace one empty faith(religion) by another one even worse.Sincerely, I'm not going to waste my time with Däniken and all the others weird guys anymore."
4,Chariots of the Gods,Interesting book.Keep an open mind!!Received in excellent condition in record time!!Love doing business on Amazon!!
4,Were the Pyramids built by aliens?,"Were these Aliens also humanities ancestors? If so why did they desert us?Forty some years ago author Erich von Daniken laid out his case that many ancient construction feats that surpassed the technology of the alleged builders were actually accomplished by on in conjunction with ancient astronauts, people who may have been our ancestors.Von Daniken lays out a very persuasive theory as he addresses unexplained phenomena around the world postulating that these mysteries can only be explained by assistance from a superior civilization.To make his case von Daniken takes us to Mexico, South America, Easter Island, North America and of course Egypt.Von Daniken's heretical hypothesis may be true or it may be erroneous but it does offer an explanation for many mysteries of antiquity and either way it makes those with an open mind, think."
2,Did not meet my expectations,The book was not as good as I expected it to be.It was delivered on time and the book was in good condition like it was described.
2,Good read,"Great price for a classic book. The Chariots of the Gods makes for some interesting thought, but the ideals could have been express in much less pages. The last 4 to 6 chapters is a recap of the entire book."
4,"Interesting, to say the very least!","This book is really an interesting read. It dares to go outside the theories of conventional achaeologists and historians, to postulate whether primitive cultures had contact with alien life forms. The author presents this theory in a well thought out fashion, first with the concept of ""well why not?"" As unscientific as a theory as it is, he later goes in depth to describe inexplicable findings in areas inhabited by these earlier cultures, and the similarities with cultures from elsewhere in the world at that time. Interesting stuff! Although I am not thoroughly convinced in the ancient astronaut theory, I am a believer that it could explain some otherwise inexplicable details."
2,Chariots of the Gods,"this book is a bit fantastic, but also probable, however most speculative, without fact to prove it. It is not something you could believe and without proven facts. However......... it is very entertaining to read, sets you to thinking, but I guess it is a ""seasonal"" item that will pass as more scientific findings will become available."
2,Chariots of the Gods,Good idea but the writer does not hold my interest.Wish he would have written his ideas in a story line. Maybe the movie would be more interesting.
5,Magic,"This is my favorite doco!!! please watch it,it shows Baghdad before the dictator ruined it.Its old but fantastic at one stage very hard to find,do yourself a favour,enjoy."
4,Thanks for posting that the VHS edition was cut,"The part that you mention is exactly what I was wanting to review. Interestly enough, I seem to remember that the TV movie told about signs of the coming of the Anti-Christ, namely that 10 european powers would come together to use one monetary unit and that the the Anti-Christ would be the son of a an ex-President of the U.S. and would also run for the office. Does anyone else remember that?"
3,A Dated Classic.,"This book has a broad reach of topics all loosely centered on ancient contact with extraterrestrial beings. While there are many examples, there are few that have any detail. This can leave you hanging as you read about astronomical computers in the time of Christ or a metal monument in India that doesn't show signs of aging.The author also shows a nearly breathless anticipation of the future in flatly stating that manned craft will reach Mars no later than 1986 and in predicting bases on the moon. And then he gets really crazy by stating that it's not really a big problem to predict the economy of a country the size of Mexico for the next 50 years.This book provides a good introduction to many unexplained mysteries...just don't look to it for answers."
1,"Not Science, Not Astronomy; Misclassified","Surprise! Why is this book in the science section? Ok, its a fun read but science? Astronomy? Nope."
3,More D.C. Damage than anticipated,Aside from the wear and tear on the D.C. I am very happy with the product and the quick service.
3,Dated material that is good for stimulating further research,"I read this book at an impressionable age and was filled with wonderment. This inspired me to ask ""What if?"" and I undertook much self study to pursue my quest for knowledge. Slowly I realized that Von Daniken struck while the iron was hot with several works pushing this topic. I thank him for pushing me into studying cosmology, astronomy, and physics so I could realize his theories were just entertaining tales that made him money."
1,great movie but.....,"All I can say is the views are breath taking but the movie was made in the mid 1970's and I wonder if the author ever read Thor Heyerdahl's ""Aku Aku"" whereupon 12 men using ropes & two logs managed to raise a 25-30 ton statue onto a pedastal about 4-5' high.I personaaly don't like the fact he inflates the wieghts of the statues on Easter Island ,he stated that they wieghed several hundred tons each but the largest was around 107 tons BUT it was found still in the quarry still unmoved across the country-side in the mid-40's I think. Intellectural dishonesty I hate."
2,Oh well ... Pass on it.,"Chariots of the Gods may be a good travel video of ancient artifacts but the severe lack of documentary evidence beyond going to ancient civilization sites is very lacking at best. There is no science or objective evidence and the DVD takes one to the sites and simply poses questions as to the unique ancient structures. There are probably much more worthy and contemporary documentaries on the topic of ancient space nexus. Therefore, I recommend to the potential viewer to pass on this DVD. The documentary could have been done so much better if there had been academic and scentific views expressed both pro and con to the thesis."
2,Absolutely does not worth reading,"Only 10% of content is interesting, the rest is author’s logical reasoning and thinking. Not worth reading. Interesting that author sound much more interesting on history channel. His book is not interesting to read."
4,Good Read,"This book asks alot of questions. Questions I dont think we will ever have real answers to. If nothing else this book is a good read for a person with an open mind, but one has to make up his own mind in the end!"
5,Chariots of the Gods,"The book is great, I can't put it down. I ordered a used book in ""good"" condition, and was amazed - the book they sent looks brand new. The shipping was fast, the price was great. Forget the mall, I'm hooked on buying through Amazon."
1,This is still in print?,"Von Daniken masterwerk which has been debunked in so many ways that I find it incredible that publishers still have the nerve to print it. I was into UFO's and the like when I was a kid and even then I didn't believe this. One thing that even my child's brain could see was that he criticises archeologists at every turn, yet quotes them as gospel if they happen to support the point he's currently making.There's a desert photo of what looks like an airplane parking lot in one of his books. He tries to show that alien space-craft used this. In reality this pattern is only a few yards long and may have been of use to toy spacecraft. When challenged by a TV documentary team about this, and other issues, Von Daniken vowed to correct future editions. He didn't do it.I'll bet that photo is still there - along with the other misrepresentations."
5,Buy it and laugh out loud!,"This book is one of the funniest I've read recently. I reread it, and read passages aloud together with friends, so that we can all laugh. If you read it with your sence of criticism turned on, you'll find risable suggestions and ridiculous conclusions in almost every passage. Brilliant. :-)(I'm sure I'm not telling you something you didn't already know, when I remind that the author was imprisoned when most of the evidence in this book of his turned out to be forged.)Buy it if you don't already have a copy. It's a keeper!!!"
1,very upset,"i had sent this to my friends house from you guys and the address was her name and, or resident. no it should have said her name only. i Am very UPSET they way it was sent!!!!"
3,A pretty dry read,I read this as a child and I remember it really stirring my imagination. I guess thirty years takes a toll on the imagination...
3,Good stuff!,"I'm about 3 decades late in reading this book but here I am now.The Amazon vendor was timely, the book in good condition."
2,Disappointed,I didn't really enjoy the way the book was written full of incredulous statements and not necessarily warranted asides it reminded me of a school project. It is an easy read though so if you are after something to occupy yourself for a few hours and open your mind to new ideas (if you can get past the author's annoying prose) then it's worth a look.
3,This is not the show from the 1970-'s,"Too many people are not reviewing the correct program. This is not a movie, it is also not the show from the 1970's narrated by Rod Serling. This is a remake (and update of information) from 1997. It has that guy from Home Improvement as the host (not Tim Allen)...Richard Karn. Eric Von Daniken and Richard K travel the globe showing old and new sites. It is an OK show but not the best. It was from 1997 and broadcast on TV. Keep watching the skies. The aliens return on Christmas day 2012, not sure why or what they want (so the Myan calendar tells us)."
1,Pseudo-Science Jargon,"Read Flim-Flam by James Randi instead. This book is full of faulty evidence, pretenses, and is RIFE with logical fallacies.Save your money."
1,An open mind is one thing...,"It's one thing to ask readers to keep an open mind. It's another thing entirely to engage in the supposition-fest that goes on in this book. His constant harping on how current science freezes out his ideas grows tiresome, and serves as a cover for his distortion and misapplication of ""evidence.""If Von Daniken wrote a little more cogently, and spent more time thinking things through, there might be some worth to this. As it stands, it's a perfect example of how to cash in on a relatively new interest."
1,I agree it's not science-fiction,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is not science-fiction. As a modest science-fiction writer myself I don't, believe me, mean that as a compliment. To call this trash science-fiction would insult our craft."
1,Psuedoscience,"Von Daniken's theory about ancient astronauts visiting earth is nothing more than psuedoscience. As with many psuedosciences, his ideas sound somewhat convincing, especially to someone without a scientific background. But the ""evidence"" does not hold up until critical inquiry."
3,Bought this after watching Ancient Aliens,Bought this after watching Ancient Aliens. The general idea is very interesting and it encouraged me to look at things from a different perspective. The examples in the book are a little outdated though and may need to be updated. The examples from the TV series are more updated and are more interesting.Might want to read his other newer books but this is a good introduction to his hypothesis.
4,Good Book for Passtime.,The Chariots of GODS is a good book if you are in a mood of reading some mystery about the earth and Extra-terrestrials. A good one time read.
3,"Inaccurate, but beautiful","Forget about the ""evidence"" which purports to be relayed here and focus instead on the beautiful soundtrack and cinematography. This film is in desperate need of a remaster from a 35mm print, as the print used for the DVD is choppy and the soundtrack has an ugly warble to it. Criterion, are you listening???"
3,Interesting,This is very interesting although a little outdated. It would be interesting to read an updated version of this work as of today.
5,This still holds up because it's all fact,"Whether you think Aliens are running around the Earth or not this is is still a good book/movie to read/watch. The reason being is because it's all fact. It's a list of various unexplained things all over the earth that are still unexplained. Stuff like how building the pyramids with soft wood and a bunch of dudes is impossible, Noah's arch had instructions that were rather odd and that angels showed up with glowing disk like crafts. After watching this or reading the book I find it much easier to believe in Aliens over gods and angels. It just seems logical."
2,The book,The book is exactly what I wanted but I selected the additional whisper sound for $3+ dollars and somehow that was dropped from my order and I have yet to hear back from anyone in regards to why! Not happy.
3,We're Not Married,"A pleasant film which is mildly amusing. Has a good cast and storyline, and it has a young and beautiful Marilyn who doesn't have much to say but gives the film her visual beauty even in black and white. I thought the part played by Louis Calhern was the best in the film,and did I see a young uncredited Lee Marvin appearing with Eddie Bracken."
2,anull & void,"What a waste of a powerhouse cast! Dated, unfunny & plodding--for Monroe completists only."
3,Why no deleted sequence?,"This is a funny movie, especially the Fred Allen and Ginger Rogers section, with a great cast but why didn't Fox include the deleted sequence with Walter Brennan and Hope Emerson as an extra? It's included on the Hidden Hollywood Fox DVD and it's been shown on AMC. It should've been included on this disc."
3,Not just a Marilyn movie.,"I disagree with the fellow who said Marilyn Monroe's vignette was the best. Sure, she's yummy as ever, and the bit was cute, but Eve Arden's scene was much funnier.Star power fueled this odd little movie that's a series of skits about marriage on and off the rocks. Ginger Rogers is great-- and plays the opposite of her traditional sugar-girl glamour bit.You're not going to come away with any memorable laughs or deep insight into anything, but if you're looking for a nice little movie to watch with your grandmother, this will do just fine."
3,Pretty Good,"The Woodstock '94 video was pretty good,but I prefere the doulbe cd instead of the video.They cut alot of stuff from the video like when Primus played the American Antheme and its on the cd but not the tape.I went to Woodstock'99,and that is a must have on both video and cd."
4,Excellent!,The first critic obviously don't know much about the history of the Woodstock festival. The music is excellent and covers all genre's.
2,Don't bother,"If you already have the ppv of Woodstock '94, then don't bother with this tape. Even if you don't have the ppv, you won't get the same idea of what the experience at Woodstock '94 was like. The same goes for the woodstock '99 tape. The only good Woodstock documentary is the dirctor's cut of the original Woodstock 1969."
2,Some of this movie was good.,This movie had a lot of junk music. And the way the people swore at the croud and the nudity. This is not one for kids.
4,Good basic reference,Paperback book. B/W photos. This is a good general reference for the BMW fan. Covers the entire history from the Dixie to the present. A good value for the money.
3,Third Season the weakest,"The first two seasons of Millennium had some of the finest episodes of any series. Stark and searing, with a raw truth that has been seldom matched. Unfortunately, the series has a total shift and the new ""co-star"" Agent Hollis is stiff and really brings down the series. Whoever thought of the character and the casting of Hollis made season three a sad shell of a once amazing show."
5,Great show!,"Why is it all of the great shows get cancelled?Prophit, Miracles, Threshold, Tru Calling, Joan of Arcadia, Wonderfalls, Dead Like Me, American Gothic, Brisco County jr., Lois & Clark, The Flash, Alias, Firefly, The Book of Daniel, Wonder Woman, Charmed, The Tick, Sliders, Jake 2.0..........I can go on and on!Millennium is such a show. Brillianly acted and written. The stories always grabbed you and wouldn't let you go.Don't miss out on this amazing set!PJK"
3,"Good, but mostly just a timekiller","The first season was really cool, with narly murders and grizzly visions through our protagonist; Frank Black.Then, it got a little weird. The second season is just kind of fluff. There's a couple great stories and some creepy episodes but I couldn't really get Into It. So again with the third, and again it's just kind of a waste of time.This Is a good show, beautifully shot and cast pretty well. Budget is not bad and there's a nice feel to everything about it. With that said, I just can't get jiggy with it."
3,The last but not the best season of a great show,"I have said in my brief review of season two that it was the best season of the show. Well, season 3 is the worst. I personally believe that the show was too avant guarde, too ahead of its time and the writers of season 3 tried to ""tone it down"" for ratings. Unfortunately, what is left is a mediocre season that deviated from the apocalyptic vision of season's one and two."
4,"Loved this series, why they cancelled, I don't know","Frank Black (Lance Heinrickson) and cast deliver as usual.Wish they had continued the series.Although the confusion as to whether the Millenium Group was good or bad continues, the story lines are intriguing and cast excellent."
4,Millenium Season Three,"Season One set a standard for drama and intensity that has not been surpassed (and rarely equalled) in the following seasons--or on broadcast television in general. Season Three, however, comes the closer to consistently recapturing the feel established in that season. The character mix still isn't quite so satisfying but is notheless largely superior to Season Two. There are also some disturbing inconsistencies with earlier episodes (some of which I can blame on the arc established in Season Two). The rest of the inconsistencies just lead to a few downright confusing episodes. So while the episodes of this season (like Season Two) run from hot to cold, in contrast to the second season they run mostly hot."
4,By far the best series of the bunch,Creative team changes again and now the series is a mix of teh 2 previous series plus an xfiles kind of flavour. Luckily it all works really well and this is a terrific series.
5,MillenniuM- The Compete 3rd Season,"A must have TV series for everyone. Sadly only 3 easons were only made. But an unforgettable series it was. Nothing has so far come even close to the quality of television this show had.Do yourself a favour & go buy all 3 boxed DVD's now. Of course Amazon is the best place to buy these from, as they provide amazing value & great service"
5,xbox wireless controller,This black controller works perfectly and the color is very cool and doesn't show dirt.
5,Black one sweats less.,What can I say the Xbox 360 controller is near perfect. The stick placement is excellent and so are the triggers. The D-pad sucks. I prefer the Black one because it sweats less. Easily the most comfortable game controller I have ever used.
2,xbox 360 matttle black controller,The product was shipped very well and also shipped in a great time. The only problem was the controller had a problem with the green button in the center of the controller you could not press it correctly it would get stuck sometimes. I was able to get it to work but this is a problem that should not happen. I am giving the product a low grade because I was not sure if I had to send it back or not at the time the product was sent. Thank You for sending it and again everything was okay just make sure that the products work fine before shipped.
2,It's not working!,I purchased this knowing that this is exactly what I was looking for. A second remote for the kids x-box 360.I can't get the remote to work. I tried changing the batteries and that didn't work for me. I'm really disappointed in this purchase. I spent too much money for this not to work for me.
3,Black is cool...,"They want me to review this controller as a game haha. The controller itself is awesome, mostly because its black. I have had a few of these and all the black controllers I have had have one problem in common. The controller will shut off because the batter thingy in the back is slightly lose and must have a gap in the connection. I don't really understand why these black controllers would be different than the white ones... On some of the controllers I could put a folded up piece of paper in there and it would fix it but others were just stubborn."
4,Its a controller!,It works! Had mine for four years and it still works good as new despite having sticky stuff spilled on it and a little bit of dirt as to be expected after four years of use.
4,The Verdict,I like this product well made have used alot since i have bought the product and its worth its value.
5,Great Item To Purchase,"Just wanted to say thanks for a fast and quick service. This item is worth buying and worth the money. It works really great, and very nice to look at. Great item for people who's hands get sweaty alot, you can't see the dirt on the controller...."
5,Fantastic!,"Wireless rocks, this ie better than wire because make it less for some to trip on the wire and destroy your baby lol."
3,XBOX CONTROLLER,"The controller is overall good, but after two weeks of having it, it suddenly begins to disconnect to the xbox while playing a game."
4,Works well with PC wireless receiver.,Pros: Bought for use in Windows and works well with wireless receiver.Cons: It should have come with a charging unit. No manual way to turn controller off in Windows; requires pulling out battery pack or let idle and go to sleep. D-pad not the best.
5,"""Different""","Say you have a bunch of friends, and you all have 360's, and you decide to have a lan party. Everyone knows after a long time most people tend to not remember which controller is theirs. ( Especially when everyones drinking, or smoking.) This kind of helps the owner of it alleviate that problem... unless you want to have your name in magic marker on your controller. Being the only black controller at our LAN parties makes it easily distinguishable for me and I dont leave with someone elses controller, cuz who knows what other people touch before they play xbox."
4,buy recharge batts,"make sure you buy recharg batt, you can buy a kit with one batt and a tree holder to charge two so 19.99 for one batt and charger then buy a recharge batt itself for 10.00. conclusion for 30.00 you will have two recharge batts and charger,then the original holder for regular batts .."
2,Xbox 360 Wireless Controller,The Overall of the controller was ok. It was very dusty and one bottons upper left it doest work now i will need to send to repair.
1,Wireless controller,"I ordered the used Xbox360 Wireless controller and the the controller did not work out of the packing. the controller came from boost Inc and the biggest problem was that it was shipped in a thin envelope with no packing material, so there is no question as to why it doesn't work. Now I'm in the process in getting a replacement."
5,It's an xbox controller... and it's black. Whoopie!,"What can I say? It's just like the white controllers, only black. I like it to distinguish between the others. It makes me feel cool when I'm holding it... blah blah blah."
2,"Good, But...","when it was sent to me i was a little bit surprised that it didn't come with a chargeable battery pack, or cord for charging it. It did though come with a pack to put batteries in, but didn't come with any batteries. I think that it would have been nice if the person would have told me that there was no chargable battery pack as i had to spend 10 dollars extra to get one which is 1/3 the price of the product. Otherwise good sale."
5,I can't sleep with this tool,Just buy the batteries and everybody get fun. This is an amazing tool to never sleep again' enjoying with my brother or a friend a lot of games online and offline.I love Xbox 360
5,Great,This controller is great! The batteries last long and the connection never drops. I like it better than the PS3 Six Axis because the ps3 controller is light and feels wierd in your hands. The XBOX 360 controller just feels right in my hand. My only complaints are the D-pad which is a little unresponsive and Microsoft needs to make new colors.
4,Great product!,"Having tried pretty much every controller on the market, The Xbox360 Wireless is easily the best. The ""D"" pad needs some tweaking, but overall it has a great feel. Sony controllers feel like they are for tiny hands. Add the rechargable pack and you are ready to go!"
3,Good but Hindered for PC,"What I love about this product:It works for PC and Xbox 360 (since I have both)A lot of PC games now-a-days support itIt's Wireless and works from a good distanceTo me it's comfortableEasily allows 4 players to play on PC togetherWhat I don't like:The triggers don't work correctly so they can be an issue mapping (XBOX DEV Morons mapped the triggers on a shared axis- not sure why?)Battery life is good but batteries are expensiveNeeds the wireless adapter to work with PC (you could just buy the one with the adapter at the marked up price at Bestbuy then return just the controller, get your cash back and then buy the controller here :) But that is illegal, SO DON'T DO IT! LOL.Had no issues syncing this with the wireless adapter or 360- I say get it but realize that the triggers are screwed up!"
5,Love the controller,"I have had gaming systems since the day of the Atari 2600. From the single joystick to the Nintendo pad to the 360 I have played with all of them. I have to say that the people at Microsoft did an excellent job in developing this controller.It is lightweight, comfortable and is very easy to use with all games. I highly recommend getting the black controller, it looks and feels better. You cannot beat the wireless function and unlike the controllers of old, you do not need to face it directly at the console."
1,Dishonest Seller,"Let me echo what CedDaGr8 wrote: I ordered a controller from TotalConsole. The sellers Amazon page all but indicates that it is a new controller. It says 'New' on a sticker that is stuck onto a third party packaging box that it came in. But this controller is very used! TotalConsole is a total liar and dishonest vendor.By CedDaGr8 ""C. Waller"" (Memphis, TN USA) - See all my reviewsFun:1.0 out of 5 starsAmazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)This review is from: Xbox 360 Wireless Controller - Matte Black (Accessory)I oredered a controller that was advertised as new. However I've tried everything but it wouldn't charge. I then realize that my controller was not only defected, but it was also used. They have not even tried to make admends. Totally unprofessional, and no one should do business with a dishonest vendor."
3,Good controller,"Love the black controllers over the old white design. Batteries are the correct size and won't cause the controller to develop cracks where the battery is inserted. Smooth operation.Overall, this controller is basically all the same as the white, but the batteries fitting correctly will make it last alot longer"
1,New is Used to them!,"I oredered a controller that was advertised as new. However I've tried everything but it wouldn't charge. I then realize that my controller was not only defected, but it was also used. They have not even tried to make admends. Totally unprofessional, and no one should do business with a dishonest vendor."
5,No Complaints! Great!,Just what I ordered for the hubs! Great value with no problems to date! Would recommend for the price and value!
4,How does this work?,"I bought this controller for my husband because I accidentally damaged his. I don't really use it and he hasn't complained about it so I guess it's great. He did mention ""Is it wireless?"" I don't have a clue and instructions weren't very clear. We've yet to figure it out but it's no big deal."
5,Nuthing like kicking ass with a brand new controller,Awesome n brand spanking new with it's official sealed retail packaging. Doesn't get any better.
4,"works ok, but battery pack container is not staying in place...","works ok, but battery pack container is not staying in place...I've had this control for about 10 months, but the battery pack is not passing current to the control. I don't consider myself an aggressive gamer, but I do occasionally slightly hit the control when I get frustrated. I'm not sure if this is why its having spotty current connectivity, but when I use the battery pack from an old white xbox 360 control, control works fine. Looks cool though."
2,Not so great,"I have a white controller and two black ones. I don't know why but, the left joy stick on both of the black ones began to give a little after only a week of use. If you playing a game like halo, and your just walking like normal, as soon as you let go of the left joystick, it continues to slowly move forward without the user even pushing it forward. Both my black ones do it, I don't know why but, the white one works fine and I've had it for over 6 months. I would just buy a white one."
3,Eh,Well when you buy used you know there always something. ABXY stuck a little when you press them. Thumpsticks are pretty loose. makes it hard to get a headshot. Just but a new one.
2,Faulty product,"I wasn't expecting any problems buying a used product online since I've never had a problem before, but I was disappointed with this purchase. I received the controller just a few days ago and it is in decent condition and still has fairly responsive controls. One thing that was not mentioned on the product (at least this one) was the fact that its right hand joystick almost constantly starts panning to the right. Not the joystick itself but the game or whatever you are controlling will start moving right on its own. Simply put this seller is selling products with hardware malfunctions. Its most likely not like this with every controller being sold but it is still unacceptable. And that is why it deserves 2 stars"
3,Wrong color and very used,"The controller has been working fine for over a month now, but it came very used and in the wrong color. Since it hasn't broke yet I haven't sent it back for repairs but the company should have been more honest about the quality of the controller and actually send the correct color."
5,totally satisfied,One of the best in the market today. This is an excellent product and I am 100% satisfied. Will buy more.
5,the black one,due to the color black which is my favorite color i love this controller. unlike the white it wouldnt get as dirty.
1,dont get things right as they come out,"I got this black controller and it has worked very well for me. I got the quick charge kit a couple days after. They both worked fine until 2-3 months later i go to charge the black battery pack and it doesn't charge. I try the other side of the quick charge kit, doesn't work either. I get my other white controllers battery pack and it does work. I think they may have some problems with the first couple. Now i have to get a separate black battery pack. I hope it works."
1,Not a good experience,"It took more than 10 days to receive the product through Amazon free shipping by US Postal service. Quickly, I found out it was defective. Then, I returned it three weeks ago to Amazon but has not received credit back as now. I am not thrilled with either the product nor the process of delivery or return."
4,What can you say about a game controller?,It works!! Price was competitive and it came in a choice of colors so I could match it to the base unit. I bought this as an addition to the Xbox 360 Elite system I purchased from Amazon as a gift. Nice how they only package them with one controller!
4,White Porcelain Swan Planter Container,The white porcelain swan planter container arrived promptly in excellent condition. I am very please with it.
1,sharp!,"Literally...sharp!These are hard plastic and nearly flat with very sharp edges on some of the shapes. While the concept of the toy is good, i.e. learning shapes and how they fit together, I'm hesitant to leave them out for 'free play' because they are sharp enough to scratch or cut skin."
4,worth it,"I am so glad I bought these pattern blocks and some design cards. My kids (3 & 5 yrs old) have spent much more time than I had imagined they might making awesome pictures. I think they are great for creativity, fine motor and even spacial learning. I do know that there are wood pattern blocks out there and I suppose I wish I had bought wood but these will do fine and shopping on Amazon couldn't be easier!"
2,small pieces,My grand daughter has played with this once but I am still finding pieces. Not a good choice. I wish I would have bought something else.
5,A DVD review,"A great romantic/comedy/adventure movie. A bit disappointed that this DVD only has a trailer. Interestingly, the English subtitles sometimes translate the spoken Spanish into English and sometimes give the Spanish in Spanish subtitles. The non-subtitled version doesn't give subtitles at all for any of the spoken Spanish. A must have in my collection."
5,Recipe for a classic,"In my opinion, there are certain modern films I'd call ""classic"" Romancing the Stone is one of these. With lines that are still quotable, ""My minumum price for taking a stranded woman to a telephone is $500"", heroines that are still as beautiful, (Joan Wilder) heroes that are still as hopelessly over-confident, (Jack T Colton) and bad guys that are still crazily mis-directed (Ira and Ralph) over 20 years hasn't taken away the appeal of this great simple adventure film. Great setting, humor, action, vehicles and ending make this movie worth re-watching again and again. If you like searching for treasure, fighting the bad guys, saving the girl and sailing into the horizon on your dream boat than this ones for you. Not too violent, sexual or profane...but maybe just enough this movie also has balance that you dont often see in movies now that go either too sexual, too violent, or have so much swearing you dont even care what happens in the movie. Worth every penny."
4,A Really Fun Romantic Movie,"I have always loved this movie. I loved the fact the Kathleen Turner was a single attractive woman without a significant other and she was a romance author. I am not yet a published author but I always feel like I can relate to her character. The man she meets is so incredibly handsome, Jack. He is so masculine like Jesse the character in the books she writes. They meet in one of the most beautiful places in the world, Cartahenya ??? Anyways it has some silly parts to it but the overall story the romance always gets to me. I would recommend it to someone who likes romantic comedy with adventure thrown in as well as some predictablility.Lisa Nary"
4,I LIKED IT,"It was a refreshing, relaxing, adventure with an innocent romance story. I miss this time and type of story, I am glad they made a sequel."
3,Extras needed please.,"These movies need extras(interviews,TV spots,soundtrack,documentary etc.)otherwise I may as well just rent the video."
4,Stone Romance,Romancing the Stone is one of my all time favorites and a joy to watch each time I view it. I love Cathline Turner in this video and her interaction with Michael Douglas is great.
3,Indiana Jones Lite,"This movie is enjoyable, but pretty shallow compared with the Indiana Jones adventures. The biggest problem is the cheesy soundtrack. This movie is only 15 years old, but the background music sounds like a low-budget 70's movie. They should have used an orchestrated score like Raiders of the Lost Ark. The result is an adventure that is showing its age."
1,Not PG anymore since they put all the profanity back in,"The Netflix ""Romancing the Stone"" had 10+ G*damms in the first 50 minutes before we gave up. Why is this DVD rated PG when they put back all the profanity they took out to get a PG rating for the movie theaters? There is no warning in the product description that it is no longer PG."
4,Jesse and Joan,"Go though the jungle of Colombia, running in to Ralph, Ira, Zolo, Elaine( not at the same time)."
3,Fox cheaps out on DVD conversion,"I will not argue about the story,the stars and the production. this is a great all around movie. But it deserved a far better DVD transfer then Fox gave it. They chose to cheap out on a very good soundtrack and pass on a DD 5.1 upgrade, leaving the original (VHS) Dolby 2.0. The film transfer is at times grainy and no better than VHS, in fact we compared it to the tape and found it about the same.The film was transferred to a 2.35 wide screen format. The only ""extra"" was the original trailer. Fox was certainly after the quick buck on this conversion. We give the film 5 stars for its entertainment value, but 0 for it's DVD technical merits. I guess that makes it a 3 overall. Michael Douglas/Robert Zemekis how could you let Fox do this to your film."
5,funny movie,"My husband has always loved this movie. So one day I ordered it from Amazon. Wereceived it very quickly, and it was a great price. This is a great way to get those hard to find movies that you always look for."
3,I thought it was better,"I saw this movie more than 20 years ago and remembered that I liked it as a kid, so I bought it on sale on Amazon. It's not a bad movie but there are much better ones out there (i.e. the Indiana Jones movies have a similar flavor but are much much better). On the plus side it is relatively family friendly and will leave a taste of the 80's in your mouth."
2,Automatic resume disabled,"This review is for the Blu-ray version.First of all I really like this movie. This review is about the disc, not the movie.I'm giving it two stars because Fox disabled automatic resume. This means the disc will start from the beginning, even if you had stopped viewing right in the middle of the movie.This is a important if you don't watch the movie in one sitting. If you turn off the player you have go go through all the warnings before you can continue where you left off.Knowing what I know now, I'd rather have the DVD."
3,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,A writer wants to fall in love with the right kind of man. The men she writes about in novels. She gets her chance when her sister gets kidnapped. The movie has a few good parts. Most of it is slow and boring.
1,Fox Cheaps Out on Blu-ray Version Too - Not DTS,"I liked the movie well enough to buy the dvd and then the blu-ray version. What a disappointment both times. The picture quality is much improved on the the Blu-ray version, however the audio is 2.0 even though the case says it is DTS HD 5.1. The only 5.1 on the disk is previews to other movies. Romancing the Stone audio is still 2.0 and Fox pulls another fast one on unsuspecting customers."
2,DVD-Love is a Many Splendored Thing,Another of my favorite movies. There were two skips in this DVD causing me to miss some of the best parts of the movie. Very disappointing.
5,Love this old classic.,This a beautiful story and I am so glad that I own it for my own personal library.
1,europe,i live in eurore and i ordered this dvd about a month ago but i could not see it because it belong to a different region i wonder if you should find a way to change the films for us who live in europe
5,Love is Splended,It has all the elements of a love story. William Holden is the best as he is always. When a Eurasian widow doctor Han Suyin (Jones) and American journalist Mark Elliot (Holden)They fall in love despite the racial diffrences and the only thing that would separated their love was death.
3,Great motives. Labored execution,"All of the scenes seemed so staged and unnatural except for the scene where Suyin goes to visit her family. That one scene seemed to me very authentic. And the dialogue was so hokey I couldn't believe it. After viewing it I couldn't believe that the film had been nominated for best picture. Must have been a bad year for film.Although I have to applaud the film for shining some light on the racism so blatantly and sometimes subtlely displayed towards a people in their native land. Never ceases to blow my mind how arrogant, ignorant and downright rude Americans (whom I am one) can be.The romance was obvious and there was little chemistry between Holden and the lovely Ms. Jones. More character development could've helped the story. What was it about Suyin that William Holden was so attracted to verses other women. And vice versa.Good storyline but an obvious story."
2,corny,The script was horrible; corny & lofty lovelines that sounded read. i was surprised how bad the movie was after reading all the positive reviews
2,Love is a Many-Splendored Thing,"Old style, didn't expect to find things like that so differently done these days. Of course it was wonderful 25 years ago"
4,Bought this as a gift!,It came quickly through the mail before Christmas and we gave it to my mother in law. Not sure if she has watched it yet but had asked for it for Christmas. Amazon usually has most everything we have ever needed so I won't hesitate to buy another movie if Amazon has it! Good deal!
1,"Man. Waste of money, twice.","This CD player breaks very easily. The first time I had it, it didn't last a week. It fell on the floor (falling 12 inches from the ground) and it wouldn't play after that. The second time (I exchanged it), the clasp fell off so the CD player wouldn't close. Worse yet (within 90 days) they wouldn't give me my money back after replacing it twice. I had to get a new SONY... and it's much better than the Philips. This is my last time buying the CD player... well of course it is... they discontinued it. Oh yeah... some MP3 songs wouldn't play the whole way through which was not cool."
3,good for a year..,"This is a REALLY good item for a year. It worked really good, good mp3 player and playing cds. After a year of having this item. It broke. If you click any button the cd plays, then you click another button and it stops. So you couldn't put it to the next song, put the volume up. Pretty much you couldn't do anything. When you don't have a cd in it and you didn't turn it on, it trys to play. I put new batteries new cds, nothing worked."
1,disappointed,"I have always had good things to say about all the products I have ordered from Amazon. However, I can not believe that this small pack of paper cost 6.88. I guess I misunderstood the advertisement when it said 20-lb. I really thought that was how much was being shipped to me. I thought it was a bargain for that much paper. I will not order this product from Amazon again."
5,Good Paper,"Hey, paper is paper. How many words can you write to say that it fills your needs. Not enough for them."
4,Good quality paper,I have a fountain pen that bleeds through most regular paper. I got this to use it and it worked perfectly!
5,Just what I needed,"I have this size binder and was wanting a thicker refill sheet but could not find it locally. searched Amazon and there it was - just what I was looking for. Great quality, price and delivery, Great job as usual Amazon Thanks. I would recommend this to anyone needing this size."
3,MJ to the Max,"Video and sound quality is outstanding, aside from that, I was a bit disapointed that much of his game highlights were left out."
1,Not very good drums,"I heard that Michael Jordan played the drums, so I got tis DVD. He dusn't plae the drums! Me angry now."
1,Poor,"I was disapointed with this video.But this fairly short documentary itself is fairly bland. It follows the Bulls and Jordan during his last season, through the finals against the Jazz and Jordan's career-ending (for now, at least), game-winning shot in which he gave Bryon Russell a spank and then drained that jumper.The best video I have seen is Ultimate street brawls at streetbrawls.com at least that is real but Not much here that most fans don't already know. If you're a real Jordan and hoops fan, wait for the Jordan DVD box set which should have more footage from all throughout his career. This Michael Jordan light, with good sound."
5,Michael Jordon to the Max DVD will not disapoint,"I have seen the MJ to the MAX eight times at the IMAX. Truly sepectacular. You have not experienced MJ until you see this DVD. It hightlights his early years at North Caroliana as well as the last 3 championship including the awesome 70+ win season. If you have a Dolby Digital reciever and a big screen the image of of entering the United Center with MJ for the last time will blow you away, you will feel the greatness."
4,If you like the Bulls and Michael Jordan...,"Being a Chicago native and a Bulls fan (not to mention an MJ fan), I especially enjoy this video time after time. It features Michael's career and his philosophy about life and winning, intermingled with a recap of the Bulls 6th championship run. Lawrence Fishburne's narration fits well, and the theme music from Fatboy Slim's ""You've Come a Long Way Baby"" album complements both the energy and hipness that MJ himself projects. If you have surround sound, it won't be wasted on this video, as with any IMAX I've seen. The crowd sounds, the Alan Parsons theme at the UC, the FBS tracks and the subtle audio effects all add to the feel of the flick and remind me again and again how much I love home entertainment technology. My wife just hates the opening seen where I turn up the subwoofer as the sound of MJ dribbling the ball in a pin-drop quiet stadium shakes half the house. In short, this is a must-have video to bring out when your sports fan pals are over."
2,Ultimate Jordan is a lot better,I bought this DVD with great anticipation only to be let down. Sure the visuals are great but I'm more interested in the plays that made the Jordan experience special. The Ultimate Jordan is a much better DVD.
2,Have to agree it's weak,Love some of the action but it is slow and feels like an ESPN interview. The 6th season in review is much better if that's what you want. This is a summary of Jordan with 80% of it on that 6th season. Try Ultimate Jordan for more action and a better use of your money.
1,this is not even a documentary,"when i bought this i wanted to see jordans dunks, his tricks, the moves. but no, this is a documentary of jordans career and the main focus is targeted on his last year in the NBA.actually, i'm not even sure if i would call this a documentary. it contains an interview with michael (specially done for this dvd) and a couple of other interviews, but almost none with other players.it hardly covers all the stuff i would have wanted from a documentary.so, if you are looking for some clean action - don't buy this dvd."
2,Do you have a big TV?,"I mean, a really REALLY big TV? If the answer is no, then you probably shouldn't get this DVD/VHS. Make no mistake: MJ to the Max is an IMAX movie, and you'll be very disappointed when you see it at home. About half of the movie has these really annoying picture-in-picture shots, which take up maybe 25% of the screen, and made me feel like I was watching streaming videos on the web. I'm sure this ""technique"" worked fine on a 80-foot-high screen, but it definitely doesn't on a regular TV.In terms of the content, the movie also disappoints. It's nothing more than a rehash of ESPN highlights, except that it is shot at awkward angles and further away from the action. Again, this may have worked on a huge IMAX screen, but certainly not on a regular TV. The movie also fails to provide any in-depth behind-the-scenes material.My 2 cents: Save your money unless 1) you are a die-hard MJ fan, and/or 2) you have a really really REALLY big TV."
3,"Good film if you're a Jordan fan, average if you aren't.","I didn't see the IMAX version and I would agree with one of the previous reviews that mentioned this DVD is probably best left for large (5') screens. On a smaller screen, it is annoying to watch the picture-in-picture interviews and isn't any more impressive than a regular NBA Film production.It was disappointed that the film covered everything you already knew about Jordan. (ie father's murder, being cut from the high school varsity squad, etc.) The behind-the-scenes footage isn't impressive, most of the film is dedicated to oncourt ""ESPN highlights"" and Jordan talking about his background.Contains more extras than most sports documentary/films including a director's commentary.Through all the negatives, it still leaves a warm spot in your chest because you can't help but admire the best basketball player of all time.Important Note - I could not get the extra features menu to work on a PC DVD!"
5,The only HD footage of His Airness ever made,"This BluRay is in true HD quality at 1080i, and was mastered from the IMAX film. This is much better quality than the Ultimate Jordan BluRay which is in VHS quality and not HD (because the source was VHS). The Audio of this ""To The Max BluRay"" is in DTS. Great price for less than $15 here at Amazon. A must-have for any Jordan fan. It's too bad there are no other HD videos of Jordan in his prime. IMAX film is extremely high in resolution and theoretically could be remastered in 2048i (give it another 10 years)."
3,High quality sound mix in a pedestrian documentary,"The only reason to get this DVD is to immerse yourself in the sound mix in the introduction when they re-enact the introduction of the Bulls and Michael Jordan at the United Center. That was always exciting for me as a Jordan fan. Hearing it in Dolby Digital 5.1 with the lights out and a flashlight and hearken back to the glory days. Of all the Jordan videos to date, this DVD clearly has the best sound mix.But this fairly short documentary itself is fairly bland. It follows the Bulls and Jordan during his last season, through the finals against the Jazz and Jordan's career-ending (for now, at least), game-winning shot in which he gave Bryon Russell a spank and then drained that jumper. Not much here that most fans don't already know. If you're a real Jordan and hoops fan, wait for the Jordan DVD box set which should have more footage from all throughout his career. This Michael Jordan light, with good sound."
3,IN IT FOR THE MONEY,"This release is a perfect example of musicians that have ability, yet settle for a formula sound that will put a few bucks in their pocket. There isn't an original lick, or lyric, contained in any of the tracks on this release. This band could be any one of dozens of Britpop clones except for the fact that Johnny Marr was Morrisey's guitar player. So what! As original as Morrisey was, there is nothing on this cd to even comment on. Pure background music to some teenage boys birthday party. Are we supposed to buy this crap and not demand something more from people who are supposed to be capable of giving the record buying public something for their hard earned money? C'mon people. Wake up and realize these people are pulling a fast one because you are allowing them to."
2,one day he'll regret it,"Jonathan Safran Foer is clearly smart and creative, and there are parts of his first novel that are wonderful. As a whole, however, the thing doesn't hold together. At its best, it's enjoyable; at its worst, it's pretentious and embarrassing. He tries to write with a world-wearied wisdom, but that ""wisdom"" is just the self-satisfied musings of a kid who doesn't realize yet how young he really is. The whole thing screams ""college writing seminar."" I'm not saying there's a minimum age for great writing. I think it's possible for someone a lot younger than Foer to write something brilliant; Foer just hasn't.Everyone's always on the lookout for the next big thing. Maybe Foer is it. There's enough great material in this book that you wouldn't laugh in the face of anyone who said so. But, if it's true, ""Everything Is Illuminated"" is a prologue, one that Foer will probably look back at one day and wish he'd waited just a little longer."
2,A One-Trick Pony Rides On for too Long,What works well as a short story is mind-numbing as a novel. All schtick. Having one of the lead characters translate all his writing into broken English with a dictionary grates after a humorous start. The flashbacks about people with insane names grates too. I fought to finish this book. I lost the battle. A literary hoax with raves from friends and teachers of the author. This is Dale Peck's (the best first novel he ever held) and Joyce Carol Oates' lowest moment.
5,An Incredible Talent,"This is one of the best novels I've read in a long, long time. It's fun, intelligent, hilarious, poignant, and honest. That why I don't get so many of the sour grape reviews. Yeah, JSF got a lot of coverage; I heard about this book everywhere, as something you have to read if you love serious fiction. And of course I was skeptical. But read the book. It's the honesty that got to me. There are lots of fireworks, but in the end the other's sincerity shines through and carries the book. That and all the unexpected laughs. Anyway, I wasn't planning to write a review, but enjoying the book so much, and reading through some ofthe spiteful reviews on here, I just had to write and say how much I loved this book. JSF is an extraordinary talent, and I can't wait to see what he does next.This is a wonderful book--entertaining, thoughtful, hilarious, sad, and with moments of real genius. I can't recommend it highly enough."
4,An extraordinary imaginative romp,"The imaginative scope of this ambitious and highly entertaining novel takes your breath away, but its extraordinary ambition ultimately dooms the conclusion to failure. The energy which fuels the parallel narrative voices peters out towards the end as the author attempts to neatly tie up not only the numerous narrative strands but the unanswerable historical ones as well. But Foer's is a genuine, prodigious talent; and the book stirs not only the mind but the funny bone, and catapults the American Jewish novel firmly into the Twenty-First Century. Bravo."
2,My expectations were high & it was a disappointment,"The language is acceptable, but the book is boring & stereotypes used are just too much.I am from Israel & am also a former USSR citizen so the issues discussed in this book are very close to me as a Jew and as a former ""Russian"". I was disappointed to discover that the book uses all stereotypes possible. The characters are very shallow, especially of Russian guy who describes their travels. It is a blend of every cliche invented about Russians.In summation: the book is pretentious & the fillings described do fill fake & untrue."
1,"Skip the book, see the movie","I saw the moview 1st, then wanted to know more, so I bought the book. The book is horrible. It is obvious (now) that the screen writer took the best ideas from the book, changed the story, eliminated the garbage and created a great story.The moview is a much better story."
2,"The Literary Equivalent of ""The Strokes""","ok, most of you reading this book are cerebral enough to have also been force fed the musical equivalent of ""The Strokes"" Is This It? oh, yes these young men are ""gonna save rock n' roll""; the next ""nevermind"" yada yada...um yeah, OK. what few can seem to admit, it really isn't very good.as so is this book. the hype machine at work here would also explain how Razorfish got funded and people *actually* pay to go see movies with nicole kidman in them, particuarly ""Moulin Rouge""so, drop this title at the next cocktail party if you dare, but really, isn't you self-esteem strong enough form your own opinion to admit that this is a mediocre book at best?hopefully amazon.com will bundle this book with The Strokes""Is This It?"" and call it the ""What the New York Times told-you-is-so-cool"" super saver fun pack."
1,What happened to computers?,"The book is somewhat entertaining, but reading it you realize that the authordoesn't know much about the subject. The part about 18 century was so unrealistic with things like lipstick, iced tea or bath tab, that I was really surprised the characters didn't use computers in that time period."
1,What's that Smell?,"Oh yes, I recognize it. That's the smell of unmitigated failure. Jonathan Safran Foer should get used to it. After a putrid, self-indulgent debut like this one, that smell will stick with him till the day he dies. The poor little tyke, he actually thinks he has a blossoming career ahead of him. There, there, my young delusional writer, you'll get a healthy dose of reality soon enough."
1,Yuck,"What a disappointment. So much hype yet so little follow through. I don't know what all the critics saw in this novel, but all I saw was a young, smug, pseudo-intellectual, half-talent trying desperately to show off how literary he can be without actually telling a good story. Man, you gots to save your money. Many good books out there, this ain't one of them."
3,Ambivalent --- At Best,"Foer's ""Everything is Illuminated"" is -- in some places -- engaging and entertaining and -- in other places -- confusing and frustrating. As one reviewer already indicated, there are some remarkably insightful comments (""She loved her new vocabulary of simply loving something more than she loved her love for that thing, and the vulnerability that went along with living in the primary world.""), albeit these moments couldn't compensate for the drivel that characterized the remainder of the book. I did, however, particularly enjoy Foer's jab at Mormonism when he remarks that the shtetl was usually referred to as some variant of Trachim*, ""except for maps and Mormon census records, for which it would go by Sofiowka"" -- the reference to Mormon genealogy struck me as comical."
1,Overrated garbage,"This is not meant to be a review, but a cathartic vent. This was among the worst pieces of nonsense I've tried to read in a long time. The NY Times review was so hyperbolic, I ordered the book rush shipping. And sent it back for return just as quickly. A major disappointment, as the premise seemed so good, and the parts featured in that review, as well. But, alas, the part was greater than the whole."
1,ugly & pretentious,"Another in the recent spate of overhyped books by young white guys. In a style that imitates David Foster Wallace & Salman Rushdie, the author strains to show us how very, very clever he is, which is very very tedious. Beneath that, the tone is simply hateful and ugly, an attitude that the author is trying to pass off as sarcastic or ironic. If you liked The Corrections, you'll like this. If you hated the Corrections, as I did, don't even think about picking up this book."
1,The Critics are Blind,"I couldn't finish this book and found it insufferable, but not as bad as its print reviewers. They've gone into paroxysms of praise, as if no one had ever written anything half this brilliant. Ever. One even said that only a few times in life do you find a book that becomes an experience. That made me wince. How can a book not be an experience? But as for EII, the humor is tedious, and ditto the magic realism. Of course, he's young, it's a debut, and he's good-looking. That's all critical in the world of publishing and reviewing, which is closer to PEOPLE Magazine every day."
1,Nothing is Illuminated,I read this book as part of a summer book group. I'm not exagerating when I say that everyone in the group resented the time we spent trying to understand this novel. One member of our group even read it for another book group and their entire group was equally perplexed. None of us could understand why this novel was so well reviewd. Good luck to all who attempt to understand and learn from this mess!
3,everything is illuminated,not as good as his other stuff he tends to be wordy and at times i was not sure who was who ie who was speaking at which times
3,An ambitious but very flawed effort,"This novel has some very funny bits, a real sense of spoken language, and a couple of deeply poignant and moving moments. But it is incredibly overwritten, while paying an inexcusable lack of attention to character, plot, and connection to the reader. It isn't worth the time it takes to fight your way through this book. On the other hand, Mr. Foer is a man of talent and with some maturity I am hoping he can produce a really good book."
5,Human reaction to a horrible reality,"This is a story of the holocost as told by one whose relatives were consumed by the fire and one whose relatives watched, frozen and unable to act. It is a story of triumph and regret."
3,"response to reader from Rohnert Park, CA","Your first paragraph says it all, and I agree wholeheartedly. But why all the concern over whether the characters or situations are realistic? With regared to Alex, the sometimes narrator, you make the astute insight that he ""can at one time hold such an incredible English vocabulary and yet have no knowledge whatsoever of how English is actually spoken."" But that's the point. And... it's really funny. You sound so square! I guess you were expecting a ""transcendental, life-affirming, mind-blowing experience"" though, huh? Funny."
1,Is this really what is required...,"...200 pages of thinly veiled pornography, to lead the Millennial generation to a place of paying enough attention to the circumstances of war and the Holocaust that they are bothered by it? Far too many good books--and many of them strong non-fiction, rather than a novel that is more the author's playground than any new contribution to the subject matter--have already been dedicated to the theme (and have honored the Jewish people through and through, rather than making them a collection of oddballs and sexpots) to make this book valuable. The book's truly redemptive character? Alex's grandfather. It's just too bad that we must wade through so much drivel to get to his changed heart."
1,Completely overhyped,I tried to read this book on several occasions but was put off by its pretentiousness and could never get past the first couple of chapters. The narrative was impossible to follow and the post-modern references to the author as part of the story simply didn't work. I thought the subject would appeal to me as my family comes from the Ukraine. But in the end what I could discern from the prose actually was quite insulting to both the modern and historic Ukrainian culture.
3,Who else is frustrated?,I'm only a few pages into this book and already quite frustrated by the narration. I get it that Alex has broken english but almost the entire book is written in this way!! I just want to read the story!!!
2,Chore to finish...,"Like many people, I read this book due to glowing reviews. The book was off to a very slow start, but I trudged on... all the way til the ending! There were good aspects of the book - I actually liked Alex's broken English, gave me something to chuckle at and showed Foer's creativity. But some of jokes got old (how many times do we need to hear about the dog farting?) and details of sexual exploits can certainly be left out.I was glad to finally finish the book, but I was upset that nothing was really illuminated."
3,Don't Believe The Hype,"Too much hype. This was a pretty entertaining book that earned far too much overzelous praise from a desperate reading public. The sad thing is that there are so many godawful books getting published that a novel like this that showes some promise is dubbed genius in comparison to the hack market. The ""circle of life"" plot is too predictable and after half of the book I was ready to hustle things to a conclusion. Mr. Foer can indeed be funny, which is the hardest thing to do, so I'll keep tabs on him even though I'll advise people not to expect too much from this effort."
3,Good manufacturing...,"Having learned English as a second language, the language plays in this book struck me as clever and well-thought. They made me laugh out loud remembering the mistakes I used to make when I was learning. I will never think again of sleeping without remembering the phrase ""manufacturing Z's"". On the whole, the book is a different and creative experience but it lacks fluidness in the plot and sequence, something typical of younger writers. The plot just does not flow smoothly at times. He also diverges off the plot on matters that detract to the magic of the book. A lot of issues and events do not tie together easily and I found myself having to go back and re-read sections to clear my confusion. However, the booking is worth reading-- it is funny, tragic and impacting. A lot to accomplish in one story. I look forward to his subsequent work."
1,This book is like cultural cholesteral.,"You people who ""loved this book!!!!"" are slaves. This book doesn't even qualify as a shadow on the wall of the cave.Wake up William!"
1,and the ilumination begins when?,"It's true: You can't judge a book by it's cover. I bought this when I was visiting Manhattan, and thought the cover was neat. I quickly skimmed the inside flaps and thought it might be an interesting read. I just finished it the other day, and it was a waste of time and money. The whole time reading, I kept waiting for the book to get to it's point. Characters were introuduced and then dismissed without explanation. If anything, more knowledge on sex was the only thing I got out of this book. It has no ending. It just ends, leaving you wondering what happened to this, this and this. A very disappointing read."
2,didn't quite work for me,"I was very excited to start reading this one as soon as I finished ""Extremely Close and Incredibly Loud"" which I just loved. This book shared a lot of similarities but was definitely more rough, less refined. His style of shifting time periods and narrators, which worked so well in his other novel, just didn't seem to work for this one. There were parts that I liked, namely the narratives from the broken-English-thesaurus-abusing Alex, but even these got somewhat old. I found reading this book to be tedious and not enjoyable. I will still watch the movie when it comes out because the story itself is interesting, but I can't recommend this book. Clearly, Foer was still working out the kinks in his writing with this debut novel. I'll hold off for future efforts. Skip on this one."
5,A TERRIFIC FIND,"A friend told me about this book and I will always be grateful--what a find! I listened to the audio version and ran the gamut of emotional reactions during the course of this heartbreaking and hilarious novel. I never knew the English language could be butchered in so many creative ways! the dual narrative, one going forward in time, one going backward, was a bit confusing at times, but ultimately, it worked. I look forward to m ore of Foer's work."
5,A Great Book,"I finally got around to reading this book, after so many friends told me how much they loved it. I had a little bit of a hard timd getting into the story, but then I did, after about 15 pages, I couldn't put the novel down. Everythins Is Illuminated is one of the most unusual and incredible novels I've ever read. Foer is both wise and entertaining, experimental and emotional. I'm still not sure, after finishing the book, how he manages to be so funny and so sad, while also being simply so out there, all at the same time.He is a remarkable talent, made all the more amazing by how young he is.If you like adventuruous books, then I think you will love this. It is excellent. I will be looking out for the author's next book; he is certainly one to watch."
2,I must've missed the illumination,"This book is incredibly funny at times, but I just didn't get it. If you put a gun to my head and told me to tell you what actually happens in this book--how it unfolds, I would just say my last prayers. I don't know what happened because I could never tell who was talking to whom. I heard that Burroughs wrote ""Naked Lunch"", then cut it up and pieced it back together haphazardly. I'm wondering if JSF did the same. I'm not one of those sissies who needs the familiar to be OK either. I admire the unconventionality of the novel, but I just could not follow it. I happened to catch a local radio broadcast of this author being interviewed and he said he wrote the book for people who were willing to work at following and understanding the story. Apparently I am not one of those, allthough I tried."
3,"Not bad, I don't get the hype","I generally love neurotic Jewish writers (Roth, Chabon et al), but this one got annoying, he strings the scenes out too long. Some powerful moments, but I was bored often. The reader of the audio version was also unconvincing as a Ukranian."
5,read this book,"this book is positively fantastic! foer writes with great humor and style, but more impressive is his amazing insight. This is such an ambitious book in every way. I can't believe it didn't win the national book award!"
5,Great book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I felt like I could relate to it better than any other book I've read recently. A very interesting and unique style of writing allows this book to go places to reach its readers that other books are unable to do. After the first 40 or 50 pages I really wasn't that into it yet, but I kept reading and quickly got hooked. I think I read the last 100 pages in one sitting."
3,Good first novel,"The extravagant hype surrounding Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel serves only to create a camouflage of unreasonable expectations and subverts an extremely promising career beginning, a promise left as yet unfulfilled. Like Zadie Smith's ""White Teeth"" (but without her degree of tonal control), Mr. Foer writes beyond our expectations of one so young, and ambitiously, with humour and humanity.The novel, however, is wildly uneven, veering between cut-rate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, abbreviated William Styron and a witty lyricism all his own. The stabs at humour frequently become repetitious or fall flat and his experimental narrative constructions are only intermittently successful as well.But he gets full marks for effort and, when his writing works, as it frequently does, it is a joy to read. So if ""Everything"" is approached ignoring the hype, it has enough delights to reward your effort."
5,defies belief,"This first novel defies belief in so many ways. First, that it's a first novel. Wow. It's scary to think about what this author will be writing in twenty years. I hope I stick around long enough to find out. Second, he's only in his early twenties. I'm not even sure I can believe that. Not because of how good a writer he is---and he's great---but because of how wise he is. He must have a very, very old soul. Also, the book is just so damned good that it defies belief. Each sentence was like a little miracle. This book is simply unlike other books. There's so much more energy and heart."
2,Not one of my favorites,"I chose to read this book after seeing the author interviewed on television. Pardon my ignorance, but I'm not sure if I understand the storm of praise that has been heaped upon this book. I found some passages funny and some very touching. However, I thought that overall, the book was a bit uneven and disjounted, and I spent the better part of my time reading it wondering why on earth I was forging on.The character of Alex is engaging, as is his quaint mangling of the English language. I also admired the ""hero"" of the book for his tenacity in seeking out family history with little more than a stained photograph and a fervent desire. As well, the author does have a unique knack for language. However, I am less sure that these elements alone make for a satisfying novel."
1,Everything is Illuminated,"What the......????? I don't know what all the critics saw in this novel. JSF is the latest ""hot writer""? What is up with that? If you read the reviews, you are led like a trusting sheep,(by some of my favorite authors & reviewers) into believing that you are reading something profound. Profound? The description of the flatulent Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (dog) ...was that supposed to be a leg slapping hoot? It is just a tragically bad, self-indulgent, psuedo- intellectual rant. This has no beginning middle or end-nothing happens. The worst of the best-selling tripe, which the publishing industry has spoon fed to a poor unsuspecting public in a long time. I am in complete shock that anyone would endorse this book in any way."
1,"Dull, stupid and completely made up","Besides the fact that the book is dull, stupid, thin on plot and fizzles out pretty fast, it is also not true. The Russian broken English is completely made up. No Russian ever spoke English this way. It's a fake. And since the main point of interest is authentic portrayal of a Russian guy in his native environment -- the book cancels itself. It's nothing based on nothing. I am sorry that millions of Americans will read this and think this is how Russians speak and behave."
1,Pretentious trash,"As many other reviewers have said - oh that I would have heeded their warnings, this was (along with The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time) the absolute worst book I've ever suffered through. I truly wished, every time I turned a page, that I was the type of person that could quit reading a book and just move on. Sadly I read the entire, wretched thing. Not only was the story utterly pointless and needlessly confusing, the writing style was pretentious and irritating. I found myself hating every character and thinking JSF must be very arrogant to imagine that people would gain anything (particularly ""illumination"") from this over-stylized yarn. Yuck."
3,"Clever, but needed a good editor.","I wanted to like this book. The premise is excellent, and it does have moments of brilliance. But it has more moments that drag on and are annoying. It is two stories in one - the journey of a young man to trace the roots of his family who survived the holocaust, and a fantasy-fiction-within-a-fiction tale of an old Ukranian shetl. The shtetl section is captivating at times, but is mostly too clever by half. The other part of the story is much better. I listened to the audio version, and the ""Ukranian"" reader was terrible, he sounded like Steve Martin from Saturday night live pretending to be a Wild and Crazy guy. The book would have been much better with some editing to make it about 1/2 as long."
2,"Mildly Humorous, Vastly Overrated","I'm sorry, I just didn't get it.This book was sold hard, and reviewed very well, and being a fan of modern literature I bought into the hype.The ""parallel writing"" gimmicks are cute for about the first 50 pages.The fractured use of the English language grows weary after about 100 pages.The ending is about as unfulfilling as any book which I have read in the last ten years.Maybe you need to relate to this story on a different level (as a foreigner, as a traveler having a unique experience with a guide, as a relative desperate for family tree information) in order to enjoy ""Everything Is Illuminated"". I came into the story as neither.I sold this book as soon as I finished it, and used the money to buy ""Prague""."
1,"Loved the movie, hated the book-weird","This is the first time that I hated the book and loved the movie which makes me appreciate even more the amazing job that Liev Schreiber and his team had done interpreting this book to make it into the movie. I could not finish the book. There are too many flashbacks, going back to the WW II time, then even deeper, and then you are lost and unable to tie all the flashbacks and people in them."
3,Incredibly Enjoyable Read,"Judging from my title, you'd be correct in assuming that I really liked this book. Why 3 stars? Because, while I wouldn't go so far as to call foer a writing genius, he is good at what he does...the only problem is that he is screaming this on every page he writes. His style is one that is so obviously telling the reader, ""Hey look at how clever I am! Aren't I so funny and brilliant...I'm great"", and personally that's a turn-off. Hopefully that won't push away some of his credibility and turn other readers off from his future works, like it did for Rushdie (check out any reviews for his last few titles). Anyway, give it a try...I'm sure you'll like it too, even if it is hokey at times."
3,Contrast just a little too strong,"This book moves fast and seamlessly between different narrators, styles, and time periods. It is well-crafted and ambitious.Many will appreciate the contrast between humor and drama and tragedy that this book throws at you. I thought it was a bit much. I would have preferred it only to go off the deep end in one of those areas, and since the dark comedy was so masterfully executed, I think he should have stuck with that. The moderate sadness throughout the book was enough to give it dimension, but the tragic climax at the end was just too much for me. It felt like the book was trying to be all things at once.Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, and better than anything I (or most others) could write. He deserves a lot of praise. But if I read it again it will be primarily for the dark comedy."
3,Historically acurate? Or rigdly proximate?,"This is an engrossing novel, motivating hundreds of reader reviews. A pattern of polarized reactions is quite apparent: Foer has given us either a work of genius or a gimmicky hack job. Little can be added to that debate.But another issue warrants examination: What do we make of Foer's fantasy world of shtetl Ukraine? At the climax of the book, on the cusp of the genocide in 1941, we are presented with a strikingly bourgeois wedding ceremony, even with gypsy waitresses. It is as if the village were frozen in the time when Chagall left Russia. What happened to the Bolshevik Revolution, the Russian Civil War, Lenin's New Economic Policy, Stalin's slaughter of he kulaks, collectivation, and the famine of the 30s? Why are they missing?"
4,Illuminating me,"My second Safran-Foer novel. Started with Incredibly Loud and moved on to Everything Is Illuminated based on a recommendation from an acquaintance.I can say I haven't been disappointed. Jonathan Safran-Foer creates beautifully, detailed and intricate characters. I am simply amazed at his writing.I highly recommend this and other books by him."
5,Did you see the movie? You're still in for a treat!,"This was the first book I read by JSF - I picked it because of its cover and although the first pages seem weird, I carried on and fell completely in love with it. I ordered the movie later, and was puzzled that it only covers about 1/3 of the plot. So, if you liked the movie, read the book. If you didn't like the movie... Read the book! And if you haven't seen the movie, well, forget about it and buy the book anyway :-) It's funny and sad and confusing and romantic and serious fiction and non-fiction all at the same time. Nuff said."
2,Drastically Overrated and Not A Good Read,"Based on all the hype, I was actually going to buy this book. Hardcover. At the last minute I bought another book and borrowed this book from the library instead. Who says God never interferes? He saved me from wasting money on an utterfly forgettable book. Now if only I hadn't wasted the time to read it.This book is bad. The manner in which it's shaped makes it hard to care much about the characters, and the bits of the book the 'author' in the story is writing not only are unpleasant to read don't add anything to the overall shape/feel of the story.Honestly this book in terms of actual quality deserves one star. It's a poorly written book heralded by the literati, because it's form was unique, but they forgot the basic premise of any piece of writing: to SAY something...this book doesn't say anything. I only gave it two stars because the form was interesting even if the author's writing didn't match up to it."
2,Everything is Expropriated,"... from better, albeit less-known, sources.I liked this book better when it was called ""See Under:Love,"" was written by David Grossman, and was a dark, original and brilliantly subtle work.The bravura reviews that heralded this book as it splashed onto the best-seller lists speak more to the author's connections and the inbred qualities of intellectual taste-making than they did to any actual literary merit. Is it awful? No -- but in large part because Foer has had the good taste to steal from the right sources, not because he himself has done anything particularly creative or insightful.If T.S. Eliot was correct when he quipped that ""great artists don't copy, they steal,"" the Foer is, without question, a great artist. By any other standard, he's just greatly lucky enough to have had enough connections to garner this book some hype."
1,"Overhyped, overtyped, overextended","Hard to read - hard to keep interested because of the lack of signposts -where am I now?? Derivative of experimental novels of the 30s and 40s. Holocaust used as a device, which is the most despicable part of this warmed over hypersexualized ""Fiddler on the Roof."" This writer needs a great deal of maturing, a lot more editing, and a huge dose of humility, which cannot be gotten when a first novel turns out to be so overhyped. Some parts are funny but the jokes are one long note, and some parts are almost insightful, but he never follows through. All in all, a bust. Let's see his fourth or fifth novel."
2,100 Words or Less,"This was recommended by someone who knows what she's talking about, so I was shocked at how much I disliked it. The plot is a bit stale, but good enough. The writing is effective. But the characters simply aren't true, especially the Eastern Europeans. Having lived and traveled throughout that area, the stereotypical bad English rang false with me. (Of course, for all I know, this is a fictional account of a real-life experience? Then I just seem an idiot.) But no matter, the novel simply held no lure for me. I lasted 100 pgs, but then let it go."
4,"Brilliantly written, tragic and mythical comedy","It's hard to describe the hilarious finesse with which Foer captures the idiosyncracies of his Ukrainian narrator. The nonlinear narrative, swinging back-and-forth between past and present, sense and nonsense, curves its way towards the underlying tragedy of the tale. A book worth reading simply for its writing, although the story is unique and illuminating."
1,Had to Abandon After Page 30,"Alex the Ukrainian's dialog is written with such obvious and desperate attempts at comedy, I couldn't take it any more.It wasn't even funny on page one.I'd rather not read an entire book constructed of amateurish caricatures pulled from the coddled mind of a precocious 20-something.Not my idea of a good time."
1,Horrible!,Downloaded it for book club. Difficult to read and to follow the plot. I found this book to be stupid from beginning to end.
2,Too chaotic,I didn't like the book. There was nothing to any of the characters that made me willing to put up with Foer's chaotic style of writing. The experience was rather a chore and a headache to read.
1,"Stupid, purile nonsense","Despite the publisher's comments, don't read this book if you're interested in WWII, Jewish issues, European history or family relationships. If you're interested in moronic sex scenes, flights of fancy worthy of the worst high school writing, rape, repetitive scenes and an idiotic plot (if you can even call it a plot) - buy this book."
1,This Book Fails Miserably,"This book is an industrial product, manufactured in creative writing workshops, assembled in corporate conglomerate publishing houses complete with prefabricated blurbs from grade-A hypesters.The book is merely an attempt of the corporate conglomerate literary industry to print money.There is no beginning, middle, nor end.There is no antagonist nor protagonist.Nobody falls in/out of love.Nothing happens.The book just rambles on and on and on.And now that we know Dave Eggers writes reviews for his cohort's books, all the positive reviews are suspect.Don't be duped by the dupers here."
1,Bummed Out!,"I really wanted to like this book and Foer's writing. Really! Yet this is one of those exceptions to the book/movie rule (for me.) I sought out the book because I loved Liev Schreiber's movie which is based on the book. I tried, I really tried -- three times in fact -- to get into Foer's book. But is the worst of urban rush hour, start-stop gridlock during the hottest part of summer in a car with no air conditioning. Not where you want to be. Bummer. The movie is wonderful."
3,A very Jewish tale,"I think a Jewish person would have a better appreciation of the writing and humor of the great great great great grandmother story in this novel. I was interested in the Ukraine and this book turned up in my search. Many horrible deaths occurred in the Ukraine during the war. The novel told the story of Jewish killings. There were also millions of people killed who were not Jewish but there was no mention of all the other war horrorsThe story of the great great grandmother and grandfather is much fantasy and the dialog between characters simplistic. My favorite character was the translater, Alex. He had great insight and wonderful languare skills. There are some funny and insightful parts of the book for everyone."
2,Read the first couple of pages before you buy this...,"If you can stand the way he writes... then go for it. But if I'd read even the first page, I would have been illuminated, and saved myself [$]. It's unbearable. Don't listen to book critics. There is something wrong with them. It's not hard to get four stars on Amazon, and this book couln't, yet these flipping critics loved it. I don't get it."
2,"Mildly entertaining-- but when all is said and done, pretty shallow","I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is probably the most overrated book in many, many years. What is the point to this book? As I read it, I felt like I was reading something that I had read already because this rips off about 20 other books (the author is no doubt well read)! I enjoyed the writing style, which is often times quite clever. However, Mr. Foer needs to go out and experience life a little more before he can write a novel that has a lasting emotional impact-- an original style may work for one book (or in a college creative writing class), but style can never make up for substance in the long run."
1,Wildly over-rated and over-hyped,"Reviewers go nuts over debut authors, especially if they're young and attractive. Perhaps it's peculiar to America, but at any rate it results in one over-rated and over-hyped book after another, year in and year out. I loathed the humor here, found it tired and obvious; ditto the magic realism. The advertising juggernaut had made me suspicious that there was much less here than was flaunted. Reading it, I found that to be the case. As BR Myers says so well in A Readers Manifesto, why not read a richly observed novel by Balzac instead, rather than another so-called ""must read""?"
2,Above average attempt at humor,"Foer's attempt at the comical journey, is remaniscent of many TV sitcoms where one's pre-conceptions of many situations can lead to many supposedly funny misunderstandings.Thirty-mintues of this type of humor is bearable; but near 300 pages? I had no impulse to finish the book. I was hoping for a message, a statement, and all I got was the author telling me: Who really cares?As for the inventive style of Foer to place himself within the conifines of the story; that was done before and with the ironic twist that I think Foer was aiming for in Martin Amis' ""Money"".Foer is not qualified enough to refill Amis' inkwell, judging by this poor effort."
5,best book ever,read this bookwrite john a letterread the book againgive it to all your friends.I think Spike jones could do a good movie out of this. Or maybe wes anderson?
1,Read this before buying it.,If ever there was a book to get from the library before laying out money it is this one. I was bowled over by all the high praise this book got. But since I tend to distrust critics I got this from the library. So I read it and it was everything I could do to finish it. It is not interesting and deals in such dark images that it should not be read late at night or nightmares will surely result. It is loaded with inacuraces as well. Of all the characters in the book the most likeable is a dog.For sure there will be many who would beg to differ. But if you like your books uplifting steer clear of this.
3,I Loved it/I Hated it/I've already Forgotten it,"At times overwritten, at times underconceived, this novel often drifts along on the force of the emotion the author wants to convey but too often falls short of being actually emotionally engaging. Typical in First Novels of Great Ambition, Foer throws every trick he can think of into the stew-pot, including screenplay formats, dream chronicles, endless lists, and a loopy, Simpsonesque cast of characters you can't even begin to keep straight without a pad of paper nearby. Throw in an annoying, predictable, straight from TV plot ""twist"" at the end, and you have a book that, minus Foer's industry connections and the trendy WWII-based plot, would most likely have rotted in the slush pile."
3,Everything is Overrated,"If you think there is no way a book could live up to the hype this book has surrounding it, you are right. This is a perfectly average tale told with enough gimmickry to, apparently, convince most people they are experiencing literary genius. If you are one of those discriminating readers who is automatically suspicious of ""popular opinion"", be advised that there are, in fact, better books out there, contrary to what the hubub over this novel would have you believe. (Anything by Garcia Marquez or Saramago comes to mind...)"
2,Nothing new here,"Good book if you have never read Singer, Marquez or Rushdie. If you think the reviews for EII sound good, read ""When Shlameil Went to Warsaw"" by Singer, ""100 Years of Solitude"" by Marquez and ""The Moors Last Sigh"" by Rushdie and see the source of most all of JSF's ""ingenious"" devices."
1,The Textbook Definition of Overrated,Jonathon Saffron Flowerhead (or whatever his name is) is this year's version of Junot Diaz--a marginal talent with major marketing bucks behind him and a few New Yorker editors in his pocket. That's all. Don't waste your time.
2,Over hyped,"The book was ok at best. The book - as other reviews hint on - has way too much positive hype behind it. Yes, the writer is showing promise and I really liked how the story is 3 tales combined, but, in the end, the book just comes up way short. In my case i am still wondering what Foer was even trying to say/accomplish with the book.Looking for something to change you - go read A Heartbreaking Work of Stagger Genius or You Shall Know Our Velocity (both by Dave Eggers) they are a far better use of your time."
3,Not worth it,"Parts of this book are wonderful, funny, touching, magical, and I found myself reading passages aloud to my friends. As the story progresses though it descends into madness and darkness and in the end the pain and confusion the reader is left with are too much (at least for this reader.) If one of the goals of this book was to deeply affect and disturb the reader then job well done."
1,One Wild and Crazy Guy,"To answer those quandried about ""spleening"" -- methinks Foer's character functions it to mean ""chastize"" or some other term of reprobation.As for the narrator Alex's use of this kind of misassembled English, Foer stole it from the Wild and Crazy Guys skits of SNL (who stole it from others poking fun at Polish/Czech ""accents"" by having them speak with a Thesaurian formality). The SNL skits were funny coz they lasted 5 minutes max. Foer's is decidedly NOT funny coz it last hundreds of pages.And would those one-star reviewers complaining about how Foer's just another corporate packaged, good-looking guy take another look at the guy's dust jacket photo. The guy's a frickin geek mensch or whatever that word is (and this coming from a geek mensch or whatever that word is).A confusing inpenetrable read that had me pining for whatizname's _The Corrections_."
1,Something didn't click...,"I understand that there are many authors who have won phenomenal awards for writing books using prose that's not as common as plain old English. And though I'd like to think that I can read what critic's would hail as ""stunning"", ""sophisticated"" and ""stylish""....by Chapter 3, instead of sinking my thoughts into the characters, I was ridiculously lost. Instead I found myself rereading sentences to try and decipher what on earth he was talking about, who was saying what and where the hell was everyone now. Thinking I couldn't be this illiterate, upon re-reading the 3 chapters, I still couldn't wrap my head around Foer's style of writing. I'm all for artistic expression but if I have decipher a book in order to enjoy it, I'll take a ""simple"" book anyday compared to this run. And may I ask, is there such a word as spleening?"
1,Completely overrated,"This is one of those books that I think of as an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" book, one that everyone oohs and aahs over because they think they're supposed to, so they'll seem smart and deep. Well, call me a shallow dummy because the time-jumping plot is confusing and many touches, such as Foer's grandfather's sexual prowess, are baffling and unnecessary. The language, supposedly whimsical and mystical, annoyed me to no end. The only vaguely entertaining parts of the book are Alex the translator's sections, and they are threaded with an undercurrent of mockery (on the author's part). The only reason I managed to plow through this book is because I read it while I was on vacation and it was the only reading material I had. Save your money and read his far more talented wife's book, A History of Love."
1,Confused,"I felt this could have been an excellent novel. But, it jumped around so much that at times I had a hard time following it."
3,not for smooth reading but worths it...,"I could not engage with this novel as much as I wanted although the author has too many merits. Maybe because I was going through a stressful phase. So although I rate three starts, I still believe it is worth reading it. This multi-perspectival narrating technique, with language games and not always linear timeline is an interesting experiment. I know that these are not new and there is something not smooth in reading. Maybe the author wants that intentionally. It is a challenge to the reader.... But of course this may be due to the fact that the author attempts to portray comedy and tragedy (Holocaust) elements together..."
5,Extarordinary,"Moving, funny, simply extraordinary! I enjoyed it thoroughly, even if English is not mother tongue. The Author's use of the language is that of an artist and of a real master, and the two-voice narrative is compelling and totally absorbing. Safran Foer is able to take the reader into different worlds with the levity and magic of a dream. A must.Anna Cossiga"
5,The Movie-Book Inequality...,"It'd seem that through the endless efforts of Liev Schrieber to reconcile the script with Foer's book, he ended up being loyal to the spirit of the original story but with an alternative plotline. In Liev's hands, the story is molded into a splendidly artistic showcase with a peppered ending that's different but equally engrossing. In Safran( Hebrew for Librarian) Foer's hands, it is a sad piece of dark history waved into the fabric of humor reminiscent of John Irving's. A hailed tribute to the memory of those who were killed simply because they were easy to pick on. But it is more than that. It is a worthy tribute to the very nature of rememberance. Memory is the most powerful means we have of righting the wrong that obliterated the prosperous European Jewry, Gypsies, homosexuals, intellectuals and political leaders that dared to speak out against an Evil unmatched by our history insofar as history goes back."
2,"Half entertaining, half too clever and tedious","I listend to this BOT. I laughed out loud during the opening sequence. Alex's ""interpretation"" of his American friend's story was fun to listen to. Then, the book switched to the 1700s, the story of the American's ancestors, and it was so relentlessly boring, repetetive, filled with minutia (lists, sorrows, etc) that at times I think I may have dozed off while walking. As Alex's grandfather's story is revealed by the woman they so much want to be the woman in the picture (who was a marvelous cahracter)the story reaches its emotional zenith. In retrospect, I wish it would have been easier to read rather than listen to this novel. Then I could have skimmed the historical sections, saved much time and not missed anything. But, in reading, I would have missed the mangled translations that made the novel worthwhile. 4 for Alex. 0 for everything else. Average=2."
2,"Ambitious, but...","On the plus side, this is ambitious, creative, original writing.On the negative side, the narrative is often incoherent, and sometimes so emotionally shattering that one longs for it to end. It is also marred by a persistent ""Aren't I clever?"" whispering around the edges of the text.Overall, it is worth reading if you have some spare time, but seriously flawed."
4,Review of EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED,"I saw the movie from the book, before I actually read it, so my opinion my not be so objective. I liked that the book viewed both Alex and Jonathon differently. After having seen the movie, I never would have thought that Jonathon would have said so many sexually related topics about his grandfather. I wasn't really wild about the 18th century section of Trachembrod, but I really enjoyed the 20th century descriptions. He said that the Trachembrodians knew that their village was in danger, yet nobody fled. They just sat there, waiting.I preferred the movie's ending better than the book's ending. However, that last letter (in the book) is really emotional.I guess that I've said enough!"
4,"Good Filling, not exactly a candy bar","These bars are a good size and suprisingly filling which is a good thing at 280 calories a piece. Based on other reviews, I was expecting them to be a light texture tasting like a Snickers bar, but I found that not to be the case. They have the same dense chewy filling as all other protein bars, with a thin layer of caramel/nuts on top. They taste good enough, just don't be expecting a decadent fluffy candy bar."
3,Arrived Melted...TWICE,"These bars arrived melted. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement box . They also arrived melted. If you don't mind melted bars, go right ahead. Melted bars that you have to peel away from the wrapper just aren't for me."
1,"tastes like, uumm, sorry, POO!","Tastes like POO!Literally!I promise, as soon as you taste it, you will be wondering why you can smell excrements.GROSS!The first time I tried it, it was ok.Maybe the second batch was bad?!"
1,MELTED - I got mine in NOVEMBER in KY - it is probably a warehouse heat issue.,"My protein bars were melted - and I'm now needing to clean up my work desk, because there are chocolate crumbs all over the place.I live in Kentucky and this is November. The bars didn't melt, sitting at my doorstep. They probably melted sitting in Amazon's warehouse - considering the fact that the product I got was sold my Amazon itself.Very dissatisfied. If Amazon can't produce better results than this and do so regularly, they should NOT be selling this product!!"
2,Melted chocolate,"These bars might be very good if they did not need to be refrigerated. I received mine in a box that stated to refrigerate before opening. After 24 hours in the refrigerator, I opened the box. I could see without even opening the wrappers that the bars had melted in shipment. They were caved in. When I tried to eat the bar, I could not bite off a piece to chew. The bar was hard and cold. I tried putting the unwrapped bar in the microwave for 5 seconds and it was still to hard. It took 10 seconds to make the bar edible. I did not enjoy a warm, melted bar. I did like the taste, but the warmth and the melted chocolate and caramel was not good. I did get a refund. I wish I could find these local so that I did not have to suffer shipping meltdown. The thing I liked the most is that I stayed full from breakfast through lunch. I noticed I ate a lot less at lunch. I just can not stand the warm, melted condition of the bars."
1,Cat Crap disguised as protein,"I have tried many different protein bars over the years, but this one tops them all as the worst of the worst! The texture is not dissimilar to numerous other bars and caramel, peanut butter and chocolate are standard in about 90% of nutrition bars on the market. The smell is normal, but 3 seconds after the first bite and suddenly I know exactly what cat crap must taste like! The taste suddenly makes me think I'm standing in the middle of a giant catbox trying to scoop out the poop! Anyone who has taste buds left should pass on this one."
4,Protein Bars that taste great,These bars are awesome. Taste very good and pack a lot of protein. Only negative is that the price went up by $5-$10 in the past couple months.
5,Traditional Gospel Music,"This is the best CD I have ever heard in a long time, the songs have a great message in them. Yvette Flunder and The Praise Ensemble sound just wonderful. I don't understand, why the CD was stopped, but I'm so glad that there is still a way to get it.I rate this CD as a 5 - you should get this CD - I promise you, that would be the best thing you could ever do.Charlene Moore"
4,STILL IN TOP FORM,"This recording from December, 1966 may have been the last one on which Hawk was still in top form. He plays this program of standards with wonderful sensitivity, inventiveness and tone. Accompanied by trio of Barry Harris, Bob Cranshaw and Eddie Locke."
2,Good Adinkra Symbol Source,"Symbols of Africa is an impressive attempt to cover a very wide range of cultures and subjects. The 'symbols' range from hair styles and body modifications to jewelry and cloth designs. Most of this is not very organized and poorly illustrated. But the chapter on Adinkra Symbols (pictured around the border of the book's cover) is very good. In this chapter the illustrations capture the symbols in their rough, natural form. Precise, one-sentence descriptions accompany each Adinkra symbol. The book is worth it for this one golden chapter."
5,Wonderfully Strange,"These singers harmonize through mysterious songs aboutstrange. and ordinary, things--through beautiful female lead singing, with fascinating percussion andhorn background, and bass that is perfect to balance the varietyof harmonies. This is not like Manhattan Transfer, no, it ismore personal, more immediate. The impression is latin andcontemplative, while being no-nonsense and straightforward inexpression. It is a wonderful mix of the familiar and theunfamiliar, the new and the understandable. And the harmonies--as I said before, are simply wonderful. The feeling of the music is sweet, and bittersweet, sassy and fulfilling. Naxos has another jazzy CDin its extensive collection of excellent music."
4,Awesome Concert!,"My only complaint about this video is the ""sentimental"" stuff at the beginning and end, though there is none of it during the concert itself. In many ways, this is my favorite over ""Live At The Met"", made 4 years later. I can't tell if Williams is on drugs during this performance, but if he was at the time, it just made him funnier. He interacts a lot with his audience here, kind of the way he does with 1988's Salute to the Improv. This is Robin Williams at his comedic peak, and is a must buy for a fan of his stand-up shows."
4,Speculative fiction that deals with a sensitive subject,"Adam-Michael James takes an interesting twist on family cruelty and poses a big ""what if?"" What if you could undo all the bad things that happened to you? Would you be better off, or would you make matters worse. What if you could be transported in time? What would you do, what would you not do? That's the premise of ""Undo the Deed.""James' speculation makes for an interesting novel. In some ways, it is reminiscent of the famous book by Marge Piercy ""A Woman On the Edge of Time"" --in that novel a woman in an abusive relationship finds herself transporting back and forth in time. Here, the protagonists get choices, take chances. If you like speculative fiction, and fiction that deals with an emotionally charged subject such as abuse, you will find ""Undo the Deed"" fascinating. I did. (The subject can of course be disturbing if you are a victim of child abuse--so be forwarned. )"
4,"Even when ""in the gutter"" he sees the varied universes above","Another autobiography/ethnography of a 20th/21st century man - beautifully written, descriptive, reflective - a gentle voice in a world of harsh realities. I find his voice honest and intentionally frank - he wants to tell us how it was, and does his best to do this with complete honesty; he trusts us, his readers, to hear honestly, to reflect with our verity, to compare our vision of truths, and he challenges us - to be as accepting as he is, to struggle with the difficult concepts (as we all do) and to dispel all doubts that might occur (whether these doubts spring from our own stuff or his writing).He shares his life experiences generously, asking for and providing acceptance. I found his views interesting & informative and his experiences courageous, revealing and alive with humanity.If you like reading your valued friend's up-market journal (with permission), enjoyable and revealing."
4,An interesting life and interesting views,"He writes very well, sometimes poetically. His views are original and his range of enthusiasms and the challenges he embraces are stirring. There is a lot of honesty in this biography, but I think he deludes himself when he says on page 452 that he regrets hurting anybody: he thinks his sketches of people are merely witty, but they are often cruel and must hurt, especially people whom he knew as friends. And I was surprised to discover, for all his self-denigration, so much vanity in him."
1,Do not have exercise questions,"This book is A world History Homework book but does not have any questions for the students, you have to create your own questions. I highly recommend do not purchase this book."
5,1985 Redux,"Yes, there were problems with the original remastering but it's fixed now and this remaster deserves a five. Everyone who is a New Order fan already knows how wonderful this music is so go out and buy it!"
1,good material - bad remastering,Please note - most reviews are not about this cd set.See the two newest reviews (other than this one). New Order fans consensus seems to be that there is a major but quick flaw on the first disc and many problems on the bonus discs.
4,Great Album - Flawed Master,This is one of my favorite albums of all time but I have to jump in on the remastering issues. I just bought this yesterday and I have the same flaw on the song Sunrise that the previous reviewer reported. I'll take his word for the exact time of the flaw but there is definitely a remarkable volume drop in the right channel in the middle of the song. The right channel corrects itself pretty quickly but when I heard it I thought something was wrong with my CD player. This is a very noticeable flaw. I even pulled out my Retro box set to listen to the song there to see if the flaw was part of the original master. The Retro version is fine as is my old copy of the CD. Is there anyone out there who bought a copy of this reissue that doesn't have that volume drop on Sunrise?
5,"Manchester 1, Everyone Else 0","I got this last week and I've been in love with it ever since. It oozes class from its every groove, from the moody This Time Of Night (one of my favourites) to the more upbeat Face Up, which always gets me dancing. Sunrise is excellent too; I don't think I've ever heard Bernard Sumner sound so hacked off. My only quibbles are the chopped-up version of The Prefect Kiss (the lyrics are really hard-hitting on the Substance version and it loses some of that on this album) and Sub-culture: again, the Substance version gives this original a kick in the teeth. Despite these, though, it's superb stuff - then again, I didn't expect anything else. Guys, if you happen to be reading this, nice one - can't wait for the new gear."
4,New Order's best album,"The anti-war homage which opens Low Life, ""Love Vigilantes,"" is the finest song New Order ever recorded. Almost as good are ""The Perfect Kiss"" and ""Sunrise."" This album proves that not all synth-pop music sounds like it was made by mindless robots. New Order writes compositons capable of making you feel, think, and dance all at the same time."
3,okay but not the best,"This book was good in that mass market fantasy kind of way. The only thing I found wrong with it was that about the first hundred something pages was re-telling of previous stories. I found that annoying. These books are good if you don't want to have to think to read them. My all time favorite author, of course, is Diana Wynne Jones though, so read her for original stories."
3,predictable and drawn out,Mercedes Lackey is a good story teller but the storm series but after reading the last of the herald mage series and the arrows this story was very predictable. Disaster! Miraculous solution! Worls saved. It shouldnt have been a 3 book series.
5,Why this book?,"This wonderful story of adventure and duty pulls you in with believable human, and not so human, characters. Admittedly a slow starter, once Karl (main man) reaches the palace things begin to pick up.Although it would be best to read the other books of Valdemar to better understand and fully appreicaite the other characters you see, this book is worth a look.Filled with magic, both in the story and in the writing, I find myself able to love the personalities within the pages almost more then the story itself. Not much on vauge villians, and you don't get any more abstract then a magical storm that started in the far distant past!, I had no trouble getting into this book and think that you should give it a try too."
5,fantastic!,"This is the very first book I read by Mercedes Lackey. In the beginning I thought it was very frustrating, just because I hadn't read her previous books. Once I started to feel comfortable with the characters, I couldn't put the book down! I read all of the ""Winds"" and ""Storm"" books, as well as ""By the Sword"". Mercedes lets you share the thoughts of the characters. I particularly like Karal. He is able to detect the human side of Tremane.This book is highly recommended"
5,Karal the Karsite in Valdemar.,"I've only read the ""Arrows"" series(the first and the last),and decided to check out this one.I enjoyed it even more.I like the plot,although reading about Charliss was boring and I did it just to have the background understanding.The characters seem to consistently encounter moral questions,and we see and follow their thought processes while they figure out the answer.At the same time it's nowhere near a boring preachy book,and the suspense builds up.As you can see from my title,Karal was my favorite character there.And him being an ambassador's assistant,and eventually the ambassador in a country that was traditionally Valdemar's enemy - it's interesting!:) It's definitely a good read!"
3,alright,"if you like this write, it's an alright extension of the storyline, but not as good as earlier books in the long series."
3,"Great book, but not quite Lackey's greatest.","I enjoyed reading this book, but I liked the Mage Winds trilogy far better. I was also kind of hoping to read more about Elspeth & Darkwind."
3,Good Book,I love this series but this is not one of my favorite books in it. I received the book in great quality.
1,Kindle Version,"This is a fine tale ruined by a craptastic scan. There are many typos, garbled words and phrases, and even missing text. Do not recommend."
4,Very Well Done,"Those of who remember the centennial may have read this in Look Magazine. In a way, this is part of the history of the Civil war and is a unique alt-history. Kantor was one of the best-known authorities on the Civil War at that time. He wrote a very readable, intelligent how the CSA wins and one that is as readable today as it was 40 years ago.This is a very quick read and loads of fun."
3,What would happen,This is a very good book about the civil war and what could have happened if the north lost. When you read this book you will find out what happens to President Lincoln and the rest of North America. This book recalls the battle of Gettysbur and many others of this american war. It goes up to the sixties (which would have been the present when this book was written). I encorrage anyone who enjoys the past and wars to read this book.
3,Rather Drab and Boring,"If The South Had Won The Civil War isn't the most appropriate title for this book, rather How The South Could Have Won The Civil War would have been a much better title. 90% of the book consists of the events leading up to the surprising C.S.A. victory and 10% of the events that take place after the Civil War events dies down. Overall I kept hoping that the book would pick up steam and turn out great and that moment never came."
2,Good price,"The problem with this tensioner pulley is that it has more resistance in the rotation than the stock pulley. That will in effect take power from the engine. Yes the OEM pulley is quite a bit more expensive, but it might be worth it."
3,Interesting but not that helpful for indentification.,"This book is full of large color pictures. Unfortunatly few pieces,that are not already Marked by the maker are identified. I also found the values did not run true to other reference material. There were several misidentification of pieces the even an amateur, like myself, could spot. Good photography-as a reference and value guide poor."
1,Not very helpful,"This book has good pictures but does not help much at all. Too many planters listed as unmarked, if you want a book to identify the unmarked planters go to another book. When it list a maker the piece is already marked by the maker. If you want this book don't pay too much for book under 8.00 would be ok."
4,Very enjoyable read,"The writer has a very straightforward style that I truly enjoyed. The fact that this was a true story kept my interest and made me put the Greek Isles high on the list of places to visit in the next few years.The author's sense of adventure and risk taking appeals to me.At the end of this book, I felt that i had acquired a good bit of knowledge of the physical aspects of the islands and even more so about the culture."
2,The Summer of my Greek Taverna,"Save your money and read ""Extra Virgin"" instead.In a book about someone opening a greek restaurant, it takes the author half the pages to even begin cooking his first meal. Much of the book is given to the author's whining about money, unfair deals and his struggles.And to Tom (the author), thanks for reminding us that you sleep in the nude. That added so much to the book.No laugh out loud moments here and the recipes are just really filler to pad the book."
5,foreign reader,"I picked this up and couldn't it down. it is beautifully written with vivid descriptions that made me feel, smell, and taste the Greece I remember from several trips there. it's also a terrific story-about a lot more than just another rose-colored trip to a foreign land. I think Stone has shown the other side of Americans from the typical ""Ugly American"" stereotype- idealistic, trusting, hopeful, and, unfortunately at times, naive! But very sympathetic and engaging. It is a funny, moving, bittersweet story which I enjoyed immensely.It also has some great recipes. The moussaka is delicious (but I personally would at least double the amount of the bechamel sauce!)"
4,THE BEST GAME EVER,I GOT THE GAME ON TUESDAY 10/23/03 AT GAMESTOP AND I THINK ITS THE BEST GAME THAT CAME OUT OF 2003 YOU GOT OLD SCHOOL UNDERTAKER AND YOU GOT KANE UNMASKED OR WITH HIS MASK YOU GET MONEY AND THAN YOU BUY LEGENDS AND ATTRIES AND THE ELMINATION CHAMBER IS THE BEST BECAUSE EVERY 60SEC A WRESTLER COMES AND YOU CAN BUT HIS FACE ON THE STEAL PLUS MORE ................THE BEST GAME OF 2003
3,Fantastic Game but something Missing,Yeah Well it's really an excellent Wrestling SmackDown game I've ever seen!!.And when it is talking about that BLOOD stuff OOOH!!That's gonna really add some more fun to the game.cuz then you will feel that you are getting all your hatrid into that wrestler!!ERRGH!!..but the thing is that we don't have Mr.America..and create a player should be more better in it's the modeling and texturing.
2,WHAT ???? Is it a preview or what ?,"This game isnt as good as shut your mouth and that thing is for sure!No announcers ! 50htz screen ! slow moves and confused grappling moves ! No real entrances for some famous wrestlers ! Strange faces with Comics style versus screens ! Poor legend section ! A boring season mode too long with useless matches !i wouldnt have thaught that one day i would say this but WWE RAW 2 is better than Smackdown ,not by far but...,and im not an Xbox fan ,since the last car game by THQ we should have been more careful...humhum ,i think im gonna drop this game in few hours...The entire WWE is falling down...Is it the beginning of the end ?"
4,everything is good but 2 problems,"This game is little bit better then sm4 because it has newer superstars like rey mysterio,scott steiner,rodney mack etc.also some of the superstars music are much newer.However there are 2 little problems with this game.The first problem is that they had no commentary and announcer (for the entrance).The second problem is that they have legends like roddy piper and sgt.slaughter which everyone didnt like ,1st they had no music ,2nd nobody wants 2 vers them which affects less selection of superstars.Overall this game is ok."
4,SMACKDOWN!!,"If I could be a wrestler I'd be Hawk or Animal of the legion of doom. I would have loved to have been one of them in their heyday when they used to demolish their opponents before their entrance music have ever finished. I wouldn't wear spandex trousers, unitard or tiny wrestling pants either, I'd probably Baggy shorts or pants. Thats the way to go. Anyway this game had the exact same gameplay but a new feature that'll sit people up is the season mode. The jewel of the new smackdown game. Fans will be surprised at the control they take. From the start, gamers can select which wrestlers are on RAW's and Smackdowns roster. Next they can choose who is a face(good guy) and who's a heel(bad guy). Another cool new move is the wedgie grapple( Its obvious what that is !). Here comes the pain will be a big hit."
1,This game sucks!!!!!!,"What the heck is this trash. Who cares about the new legends in the game if u like legends so bad then buy Legends Of Wrestling 1 2 or the new one 3! DUH! And whats up with the Elimination Chamber but its the best match but it wasn't suppose to have the elimination chamber in it! The polls say that 75% it will be inWrestlemania XIX, 5% its in Raw 2 and only 10!% chance its in Smackdown then when they were about to put it in Wrestlemania Smackdown just stole it away! Thats bull Sh*t! Plus in Smackdown Here comes the pain theres no blodd unlike Wrestlemania Xix and you cant fight anyone backstage! On Wrestlemania u can fight workers builders security guards agents Stephanie Vince anyone BaCkstage!!! So I am buying Wrestlemania Xix The best game ever Frist and Smackdown 2rate game second. But everyone Dont buy Raw 2 the onyl real WWE games out to buy is # 1 Wrestlemania XIX and #2 Smackdown here comes the pain. Raw2 is way out of the picture.IT [STINKS]!"
5,Best wwe game ever made,"Smackdown hctp really is the best game ever made by the wwe. I have played every game ever made. And when I played smackdown 2, I thought they couldn't make a better game until I play this one. Season mode, endurance, characters strength, and blood is so much more real. I recommend this game to anyone who has ever watched a wwe program"
4,Great Game,This game is cool you have several wwe superstars to choose from plus several different matches including elimination chamber first blood cage cell and last man standing.also you can bust your most hated wrestler open the blood is right on there head no bleeding anywhere else several superstars of two or more attires like Kane has with and without his mask plus new entrances and videos Kanes has not been changed nor has the dudleys but Taker and most of the rest have new entrances over all its the best wwe game I have played since wwe smackdown shut your mouth I hope my review was helpful
4,The Greatest game ever,"If you want reallife action, well you've bought the right game. The finishers are amazing. When Big Poppa Pump flexs his bicep the preportions are very similar. I really like this game because of the scenematic entrances. But one thing bugs me a lot. Why don't they update that game somewhat? Eddie Guerrerro's musica is old ese. But try it out"
2,Difficult to play,"I found the game had a great selection of wrestlers and matches, the graphis were good also. But it is very difficult to play. Even in the easy mode. The average Playstation 2 gamer will not be able to play this game at any level. Only the hard core gamer will enjoy this game."
4,"The pain is coming, oh wait, here it is folks!","Wow. Amazing. As you may of heard, this does use a different control system. If that went wrong, bam! horrible game. but no,it works, and wow. Sorry making no sense me hyper fromn playing too much. I would be wasting my time saying what the people above have said.word knife."
5,Best Wrestling game Ever to Hit Stores!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this game the day it came out and I love it.It has got the best graphics the story mode is fantastic.And the Elimination Chamber.All the unlockabal WWE super stars how much better can it get.I am looking foward to the next WWE game called SmackdownVSRAW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,not complete,"You can't play the game as a female wrestler (well since there is no Victoria or Gail, Lita IS the only girl). Happily, the ""old"" Randy Orton is in here and so is Batista. I didn't like it. There's only so many times you can play it and see the same things over and over."
2,Smackdwon HCTP is Wrestlemania XX,"Smackdown HCTP is a major disappointment. HCTP is an early version of the upcoming Wrestlemania XX for the Nintendo Gamecube. Smackdown SYM has better graphics than HCTP. The only two things I liked about the game were that they had the ""Evolution"" theme and video. Also the game play is pretty cool. THQ could of done more things to improve the game to include the original theme songs from Stacey Keibler, Dudley Boyz, and Victoria. Randy Orton, Jazz, and Victoria have their first outfits they began to use in the WWE, which was over a year ago. The outfits could have been updated because they changed their outfits before the videogame deadline. Does anyone know what was that big surprise that was ""Supposedly"" going to be in the game?"
2,lame,this is pretty much just a rehash of its predecessors just bring it and shut your mouth. theres not really anything so special about it. other than the fact it has a couple of new superstars and matchmodes. im getting really tired of getting all these smackdown games. they feature little or no improvement from the last one. well if you like a fairly decent game wrestiling game i guess this would work. but im dropping here comes the pain and im gonna get some real games like like final fantasy x-2 or ssx 3. good luck thq maybe in 10 years youll get it right.
4,Like WWE? Get this game.,"It doesn't have Hulk Hogan, but it more than makes up for that. Austin, Rock, Goldberg, HHH, Nash, Undertaker, tons of secrets, lots of modes (tons), championships, a fun season mode, titles to challenge for.. I had a blast with this game. Even after playing Smackdown/Raw 2006. Oh, yeah.. I said it."
5,here comes the pain for sure!,"this is the best wrestling game ever. maybe raw2 has a 4 player season mode but it does not have kane unmasked,bra panties match and the elimintation chameber. and plus raw2 is not so good. all the other wrestling games i have played come nothing close to this. Now all of these people who have raw2 and are jealous of here comes the pain say it has beter graphics. thats not true my precentige vote would be here comes the pain 89%. raw 2 21%. you know what this is even better than halo. but they dont have shane and zach gowen. but still this is the best wwe game in history"
5,WWE WrestleMania XIX,Hey this game was cool but they need more characters theres not even la resistance in it or the best tag team shelton and charlie dont get me rong this game is sweet it is so fun but is your looking for a game with all the guys in the wwe and not one less and all the entrance music you can get and the sweet graphics get WWE Samckdown ! 5
5,Smackdown Here Comes The Pain the best game ever.,"Smackdown Here Comes The Pain is one and it will be one of the greatest games ever to be released. On this game you will have all the features that you have wished for to be in a wrestling game. It will have from the latest features to the latest matches such as Bra and Panties, First Blood, and Elimination Chamber. You should pre-order this game as it will be sold out because it will be one of the wrestling games ever made."
4,too cool!,"This game is way better wrestlemania 19. The elimination chamber is too cool! And story mode dominates all wwe games.If you like wwe, don't buy wrestlemania 19,Buy wwe Here Comes The Pain.You'll be glad you did!"
5,the games are better then the show,this is as good as the other one's as the other one's you can create your dude. and pick your moves. it is fun but after a while can get kinda boring.
2,Don't Buy this Game!!,"Well the player selection & matches are fantastic, the game is just ridiculously hard. The computer's advantage over the player is laughable as it is very overwhelming. It's nearly impossible to beat the computer, especially if you are a new comer. Purchase at own risk."
2,Go Back to Shut Your Mouth,"Season mode is hard as all hell. If you are a challenger, you start with no Specials while th Champ has 1 or 2. It only takes that many to beat you. Also,one time Ihad to team with Tazz(IC CHAMP)To face Bret Hart and Ultimate Warrior with both of mine and Tazz's singles titles on the line. That makes no sense having any singles belts up in any type of tag match. Needless to say we lost the match and I was not the one pinned. All match tyoes really hard and the legends are so lame. If you want a game that you can actually put up offense in play WWE RAW 2 for X-BOX. RAW 2 blows this game out of the water no matter what. This game is highly overrated and you should go back to playing SD!SYM because HCTP is boring. I for one am glad Hogan and Jeff Hardy are not in this game. Oh and people, you are not Snoop Dogg and you never will be.So lets just put a stop to that right now. The A.I. is screwed up. As for the B & P matches, they are overrated, just like this game."
3,Fun even for non wrestling fans,"This game is okay, and cast of characters is great, but, once you get into connecting punches, it is rather simple .For instance, you get Goldberg and get into fight; run and press x, opponent is down. Press O plus up and you will knee his head. Get away and wait for him to get up.Run and press X, and repeat untill his body and head are red on damage meter and then pin.You can also pin after you connect few shots and a slam after. Point is to be less 'damaged' or to connect many damaging attacks, last one being L1 attack, which is usually done after you kick opponent with 101 kick , down left and x or down and right and x."
4,SMACKDOWN5,"THis game is gonna rock!!!!!!Buy it definitly!with over 55 superstars, u will not get bored with this game.With the Elimanation chamber and bra and panties and first blood mathes this game will be the best wrestleing game ever.It is just like NO MERCY for N 64 but with better graphics.this game is gonna have the legends,but the one I will play the most is the OLD SCHOOL UNDERTAKER!BUY this game it is not a waste of money.I pre-ordered it all ready.I can't wait anymore for it.So buy it definitly"
4,Awesome But Could Change,"This game is flat out awesome. The new matches, superstars, and grappling system are the bomb! Yes, I said the bomb! If you want to get a wrestling game, this one is the way to go. There's only a few downsides to this game that they should've changed:1. The refs always reverse everything you do to them.2. Once you've unlocked everything, you have nothing to spend the money on.3. Given Rey Mysterio more costumes.4. Ref should count faster.5. Use women superstars in season mode.6. Legends should have their original entrance theme.7. Better music.8. Create your own moves.9. Two-player season mode.and finally:10. Announcers should actually talk, instead of having to read all the time.Besides all of the downsides aforementioned, this game rocks! Now get out there and buy this game NOW!!!*´¨)¸.·´¸.·*&acut; e;¨) ¸.·*¨)(¸.·´ (¸.·´ *JimBob*"
4,"Best Smackdown game, but...","there are some things that still need to be improved. The Season Mode still isn't fun. If it weren't for the unlockables, there would be no reason to play it. THQ continues to make guys like The Rock and Austin regular participants in matches. They only wrestle in PPV's (if even) in real life, and it's odd seeing the game give them belts in Season Mode (The Rock as Intercontinental Champion?). CAW's are like mirages in the desert. Yes, it's fun creating legends, but you only have a limited number of attribute points for them. For example, you get Bret's moves, but then you can't hold opponents in the Sharpshooter for too long."
4,Definetely Buy This Game If you love wrestling,"First off, I'll get straight to the point. After playing the game, I give it an 8 out of 10. It is definetely a leap over last year's ""Shut Your Mouth"", however it's not a BIG leap. This game has the best graphics you'll ever see in a wrestling game. The wrestler models are full of detail. For example, Bubba Ray has his belly, Goldberg has built calves, Rock is shaved and has his new tatoo. The new grappling system is cool, but annoying after a while. The entrances are great as usual. The ""Heel"" Rock's new titantron(the helicopter and city view) and Evolution's theme/titantron are in the game. Unforunately, Victoria doesn't have her ""All The Things She Said"" theme. Her and Stacy Keibler have some generic techno music. The gameplay is crisp and each wrestler has about 32 moves. The new Elimination Chamber and First Blood matches are really neat. Overall, if you or your children are big wrestling fans, this is a must buy over the Holiday."
4,awsome,this game was the bomb nothing can beat it.This game was off the chart i mean it was the most and awsome game i have played in a long time.If you want a good game too play this is the game buy it it is worth the money and maybe more oh yeah.
1,Of its time,"A couple of good ideas--groundbreaking for their time--afloat in a sea of cultural, racial, ethnic and temporal (?) prejudice. Not a reliable reference for anything but Lang's thoughts, which may be of interest if you are intrigued by the history of the study of human cultures and how arrogant preconceptions interfered with the most basic observations in the field."
1,8in1 Birdie Bananas-Small Bird,I have 2 cockatiels & 1 lovebird and they have absolutly no inteest in this snack. My birds are very good eaters of bird & people food so if they don't like this my guess is it's not to flavorful.
2,Had High Hopes,"I bought a package of these at the local bargain store figuring I had nothing to lose.When I first introduced a Birdie Banana to my two parakeets they flew for the hills. Since they wouldn't take it from my hand, I laid a ""banana"" on the cage floor. Nothing doing.The next day I just placed a treat in their food dish. Again they wouldn't touch it.Finally I smashed a Birdie Banana to smithereens between two metal spoons and put the pieces in their food dishThis time they did eat some of the treat, a good thing because I was worried that I had wasted a dollar.Having to resort to such measures defeats the purpose of having a separate, special treat though.I had thought of hanging a treat on one of the cage bars but these treats are mighty small and they come with no hangers.The package says that Birdie Bananas have a taste that birds can't resist. Mine have done a pretty good job resisting."
2,Birdies bananas,The bird did not like these; not at all. Again due to seller's expeditious delivery of goods I would buy again from this vendor.
3,"Bought for pet rats: one likes it, one doesn't.","I bought this snack for my two rats, Blueberry & Jellybean. The bananas are made of millet (the standard ""birdseed"") held together with banana and I guess honey or something sweet and binding.I bought this at Petco, not on Amazon, but it's the same product. I break each banana into small chunks that a rat could easily hold in its hand. Also, millet is not too nutritious for rats; it's more like empty calories, which is another reason I don't feed them too much. Blueberry sampled a chunk (like a good boy!) but then decided he didn't like it. Jellybean, however, really enjoys it and will eat it whenever offered. Rats are just like people -- they don't always like the same things! ;DI would recommend this as a fun treat for rats when fed in moderation, especially if your rats like bananas in general. It also gives them a very satisfying CRUNCHY experience!"
4,A Great Start For The Stereo MC's,"Those master DJ/rapper/dance pop groovers from Britain known as the Stereo MC's have been kickin'it since 1989, when they released their debut album, ""33-45-78"" (named after the three playing speeds of record turntables). This is a solid debut album from the Stereo MC's, filled with lots of great grooves, clever samples & slammin' beats, and the charismatic, smooth-sounding voice of lead rapper Rob B. Great tracks include ""On 33,"" ""Toe To Toe,"" the awesome, funky hit single ""What Is Soul"" (arguably the album's best cut), ""Bring It On,"" the instrumental ""Sunday 19th March,"" Rob B's rap duet with T.G.G. Sherrif, ""This Ain't A Love Song,"" and the totally funky ""Move."" The Stereo MC's would make their masterpiece with their next offering, ""Supernatural"" (my personal candidate for Best Rap Album Ever Made), but ""33-45-78"" is a groovy, excellent start for this brilliant UK studio outfit. So pop this sucker into your stereo, and let Rob B & the gang rock your box!"
5,Great Memories From the Neighborhood,"I am 52 years old and actually grew up on 68th and 12th, right across the street from the school yard where Nicky Shades was Namath everyday (I'm sure he was also a great stick ball player). I found Tim's book to be an accurate portrayal of many of the people from the neighborhood, conversely we did have doctors, lawyers, politicians and successfull business people graduate from 69th street and the schoolyard. I found the book's characters very life like and enjoyed mentions of New Corners and Regina Pacis(can you believe the schools closing). I've read several Jim Leher novels and if you enjoy reading Jim Leher, you will enjoy this book. May be it means more to someone who actually lived there that I enjoyed the book so much."
5,Don't be fooled by its cover...,"Great atmosphere and mood established off the top. this is a wistful coming of age story set in Brooklyn with a cast of characters from a combination of times and places; Wise Guys, Bloodbrothers (R.Price).... pace is quick and dialogue witty and meaningful. My favourite thing about the story was the the relationships bw Mke and his dad, the women in his life...and the decision points throughout the book - not to mention the touch of mystery that snakes into the plot. I'm a fan of Price, Selby, Hamil, Auster....this work definitely ranks, and borrows from a solid tradition & genre in writing while establishing its own voice. Engaging writing style. A very memorable read!"
1,Words into Type 3rd Edition,"I am very disappointed. This is a good quality book. However, it is an edition from the early 1970s and that renders it practically useless."
4,Review of Words into Type with a question,I find this book dated in terms of computer standards and terminology. What is the LATEST version of this? Is it 1974 as previous reviews indicated?How do I find this out? Someone reviewed the Prentice-Hall updated version and found it much poorer than the original. What is the date of that Prentice-Hall version?Is this book out of print as another editor recently told me?We are trying to decide on a standard style guide for our company documentation. I don't want to pick this guide if it is out of date or out of print.
5,Still the Best,"Granted, the most recent edition came out in 1974, but Words Into Type is still the reference I turn to first with grammar and usage questions. (For style, I keep the NY Times Manual of Style and Usage handy.) Unlike the Chicago Manual of Style, WIT has a usable index that must have been put together by a mind-reader. It's organized the way people think and usually anticipates the form my bewilderment will take: Does ""what"" take a plural or singular verb? The answer's under ""what"" in the index. Should I say ""as if it was"" or ""as if it were""? Look under ""If clauses."" Is it different from or different than? The index leads me right to my answer. I wish the editors would come out with a new edition, but for now I'm loyal to the increasingly ancient Third."
2,"The content is probably great, the layout definitely poor.","The content of this book is probably great. The earlier edition was. I first came across the second edition of ""Words Into Type"" when I was in the final stages of editing my first book. What a relief! It answered questions I didn't even know I had. So I bought the new, revised, third edition, sight unseen. It would be at least as good as the old one, right? Wrong. It was an expensive mistake. Prentice-Hall managed to take a great book and make it poor. The print is too small, they put an extra wide margin on the outside with too little margin on the inside, jamming the words into the middle of the book. A poor excuse for a serious reference work. The content of this book deserves better.Sue Robishaw, ManyTracks"
1,Bad. Incomplete. Awful.,"This book was horrible. It was incomplete in some spots, and simply wrong in others. Avoid this book as a study guide."
2,By far the weakest Exam Cram book!,"I've passed my MCSE+Internet now, and this was by far the least helpful in the Exam Cram series, lacking the readibility of others in the series, and missing out on large sections of important topics. I notice that the authors for this book differ to most of the earlier Exam Crams, and I'll be keeping an eye out for their names in future - so I can avoid it!"
2,shhh! It E,"Book lacks structure, and is therefore very difficult to read. Author jumps from subject to subject without warning, and provides unnecessary details on irrelevent topics. Would only recommend this book to someone who has a firm knowledge of Exchange, but would like to learn more. Definately not a test-prep book."
1,Wrong answers and inaccurate information,"As an experienced Exchange Admin who is just brushing up on a few points for the exam, it would seem a book touting itself as an ""Exam Cram"" would be just the ticket. What a disappointment. It took me only about an hour with this book to cast it aside. It offers wrong answers to test questions, along with a lot of poorly written questions that are nothing like the actual exam. When I see such low regard for accuracy with the things I'm familar with, I can't trust the rest of the material. As for being a reference for day-to-day use, as some other reviews suggest, that's a joke. There isn't enough depth.The Sybex book on this is good for brushing up on areas like the silly MS Mail Connector that MS still pounds you on. Trancender is still the best for exam simulations. As for day-to-day admin, nothing beats TechNet and the MS Knowledge Base."
3,"OK, but only if you have extra time to kill","There are lots of errors in this book.This book covers thematerial, but unless you are an Exchange guru and just want to augmentwhat you know, don't bother. The Sybex Exchange book by Easlick and Chellis is really the definitive resource for those trying to learn the product. Not much sense in reading it unless you have some extra free time."
1,Do Not Use as a Stand-Alone Study Reference,"I realize that one must read a multitude of books on a topic to become well read in that subject, but this book is a definite waste of time. I can only say that I spent most of my time reading the Sybex Exchange Server 5.5 book and I received a 900 on my test the first time. Not to mention that this book doesn't come with any CD Rom material (practice tests or otherwise) whereas other study guides do. Take your time and choose wisely."
2,Way too many errors,"Do not use this book as your only source of study material, there are just too many errors."
2,Do not rely on this one.,"I have used the Exam Crams before to help me with the Microsoft tests. Generally they are very good. My strategy has been to use a study guide to study the material and to follow this up with the Cram. I have found that even if I dont quite know all the material in the study guide, I can do well on the tests if I know the material in the Cram. This was not the case with Exchange 5.5. I recommend the Sybex book instead or in addition to the Cram."
4,Great OVERALL Study Guide,"The Exam Cram series is great if you have knowledge of the product you are trying certify on. Most of us in this industry don't have time to sit and read a bunch of fluff in 1000 page books. We just need the facts dealing with the odd ball topics and options that we don't always encounter. That is what the Exam Cram does for us! It only presents the facts, it is not a teaching guide. These books are little rough around the edges sometimes, with spelling errors and some wrong info, but I guess they have something called competition, and they have to stay on top of it, so given that, they do a pretty good job. I recommmend this book to anyone who works with Exchange server 5.5 and wants to certify!"
1,Boo Hiss!,"I have used the Exam Cram series of books for many exams that I have passed for my MCSE Exam and have been happy with them, but this one is an exception. I found this book to be very poorly written and dificult to follow. I tried to fight my way through it, but gave up half way through, feeling that I was wasting my time."
1,A Horrible Book *RUSHED* to market.,"This has got to be the worst book I have ever read. There are *SO* many errors. For example, they call the System Attendant(SA) the System Administratr repeatedly, they say you can't set up addresses to workers from another company (Cust Recipients), they say Exchange can't exist in a Unix Environment (POP/IMAP?).Also, I know what is on the test and they make no mention of most of the material. Nothing about port numbers, MTA troubleshooting (checkstate?) and a myriad of other missing topics.THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE! Stay away at all costs."
4,Very Concise book,"A very informative book on Exchange 5.5 suited only to help pass test 70-81. It provides plenty of information and hightlights items you will be tested on. I have read other books on exchange such as the Sybex Test Success and the Sybex Exchange Server 5.5 Study guide, I feel this book does a better job of exam prep. Do not expect how to learn Exchange using this book alone."
4,Eye catching illustration,"My son is two and loved theStop Kissing Me!book from the same author, (Ethan Long) so I bought this one expecting the same response. He was expecting a button to press so he could hear a sound relating to the story. To our chagrin this book doesn't have the sound button. The book spends most of it's time on the shelf and the ""Stop Kissing Me!"" book still gets a lot of attention.We both like the illustration, the characters expressions really help tell the story. Looking forward to the next book. Ethan please add a sound button."
4,BIG a great special film with worthless extended scenes,"the blu-ray itself (as in any remastered film) is much better than any current or previous version. but as for being a ""director's cut"" or extended version, there's essentially not a single scene included that adds anything at all to the storytelling. the theatrical version is far superior."
5,Type of movie one can watch over and over again!,Our only tiny complaint is no extras BUT other then that this is one of Tom Hanks great movies in his early years! Heart warming and a must see. Penny Marshall gets our 2 thumbs up. Great stoyline nd just good feelings all around. Tender light adult themed moments with humor. Buy it new or used. Worth every penny. We've watched it about 8 times already especially with what's happening around the world :-( Enjoy.
5,This is the real Tom Hanks,"I went to high school with Tom Hanks (even was in Drama classes with him) and this is the real deal. Indeed, the Tom I remember probably didn't even have to act very much for this movie. (He's obviously grown up a bit since this was filmed).Anyhow, this a charming film. The real message for most of us is to try to look at the world - at least on occasion - with the eyes of a child. See the absurdities and laugh at what is genuinely funny. And, most of all, eat those minature corn cobs just like a big corn on the cob."
4,A nice little comedy,"Tom Hanks is great in this comedy. I grew up watching this movie as a child, and as each year I watched it with my family and as I matured, I found different things to laugh at and different things to understand. It's a great comedy that also stars Robert Loggia, Elizabeth Perkins, and Jon Lovitz. Great movie, see it for sure."
5,Our movie!,"Bought this for our 20-yr anniversary and watched it after dinner. This was the movie my husband and I watched on our first date! And even though it plays on cable often, we never really got a chance to watch it again. It was such a nostalgic moment, perfect way to capture the last 23 years of us being together. And this movie is the perfect blend of innocence, romance, wanting to grow up then wanting to be young again, very emotional and fulfilling experience watching it again. I'm so glad it came out on DVD. Love you Tom Hanks - you're still the best!"
4,Lightweight fun,"Tom Hanks is the grown-up man with the 13-year-old mind. As aboy he makes a wish in front of a carnival fortune-telling machine to be big, and his wish is granted (physically but not mentally). He goes on a search to find the machine to change the wish; in the meantime he gets a job with a toy company. Basically the movie then becomes one long joke about a ""child"" in the adult world, but it tends toward other issues, too - the loss of innocence and that surface honesty that is so prevalent in childhood and then disappears in adulthood. Hanks, of course, is a hit at the toy company (what 13 year old wouldn't be?). But he falls in love with a co-worker, which makes the decision to go back to 13 again at the end more heartrending. Hanks is very good in this child's role. Worth a watch."
4,Great performance from Hanks,The film has alot to say about the child in all of us and the need not to become too grown up. We all need to have a sense of fun and spontaneity.How many other actors could really make you believe that they were an 11 year old boy in a man's body?But it really is a coming of age tale as Hanks gets to discover more than he ever bargained for in the adult world. Both good and bad. A discovery that all young people are beginning to make at that time in their lives anyway. But what a privilege to be able to see the best of both worlds. More of us could use that kind of miracle.Whether he's squirtin' silly string out of his nose or sharing a tender moment with Elizabeth Perkins Hanks remain sincere and believable.An entertaining and heartwarming experience.
5,BigFun.. Cute,"This is a great movie.. I have seen it many times before.. and I am glad now that I own it.. Watching an adult play a child with other adults.. is really cool.. check it out.. makes you really think of the ""If I could do it again, What would I change"" and this movie does just that if you could be a kid again.."
5,Awesoe movie,I've always loved this movie. It's great for the entire family and is one of my favorites with Tom Hank in it.
4,Bigger and Bigger...,"One of the early steps on Tom Hanks's journey to the annals of the Great Actors of the 20th century, this movie was, in a word, terrific. It had terrific acting, a terrific plot, and terrific writing... Tom Hanks is one of our national treasures, so to speak, and his portrayal of a 30-year old kid is dead on. This movie is one of those highly recommended ones every family should see."
2,Picture quality very poor--definitely not HD as advertised,We rented this to watch over our Roku 2 HD and the picture quality was so poor that we turned it off after 20 minutes. The problem was not the Roku or the connection as we watched other programs the same evening that were fine.
5,"Review by Sangram from Umass, amherst.",this is another really cute movie. Tom hanks looks so very young and cute in this movie while he was so much younger and was still a new actor back then. Even Elizabeth Perkins looks very hot and quiet stunning in the movie. Overall its a good pass time movie and also quiet entertaining with all the thrill that takes place between tom hanks & Elizabeth Perkins right from the beginning to the end. Being a movie buff I would also recommend this movie for ones private collection.
4,BIG,The case and art work was a little old but the dvd was in perfect shape. I really liked it. Thanks!
3,"Sound issue. Other than that, great","Well, it was great to have extended version of the legendary classic-wanna call it a classic.But I felt a little sad knowing the fact that it's still 2 channel only.Actually there's not many scenes that I am dying to see in 5.1 or even 6.1 channel since this is not like Star Wars, but still it's DVD."
4,Where's Tom Hanks?,I don't see Tom Hanks' name anywhere on this page? I thought he was in this movie.
3,Average movie full of laughter,"I saw this movie years ago when it first came out in 1990. It was a great movie for the whole family to watch. Full of love, laughter."
3,"Funny, but very 80s","When I first watched ""Big,"" I loved it. I thought it was hilarious. However, more recently, the film strikes me as too 80s. Some of the humor is corny. The whole influence of the toy industry seems outdated (conventional toys seem to be much less important nowadays than video games). It's still a good movie, but I'm not sure how it'll wear with time. Definitely worth your checking out, but probably not a movie you'll rewatch frequently."
4,"Movie ""Big""",Great movie. Brings back a lot of childhood memories! Watched it with my 10 year old son and he loved it as well!
4,Still a great movie!,If you are thinking of watching this with kids under 10 think twice. PG in 1988 is VERY different than it is now.
1,Great Movie but Amazon HD kept crashing,Of course the movie is AWESOME but Amazon HD kept crashing. Eventually I gave up and re-rented it in non-HD which worked better.
2,not my thing,"This game has been touted as the best of it's kind, I guess it's just not my kind of game."
5,Awesome!,"Graphics are stellar. Most odjects are 3D drawn for a 2D game. The play is excellent, but hard. However after every hour you play it adds more lives until free play is unlocked. If you like 2D shooters this game is a must."
5,Great value,"Background: I'm a guitar student, and use a metronome while practicing to keep good timing.First of all, I would highly, highly recommend using a metronome while practicing your instrument. If you can establish good timing while playing, it makes such an amazing difference to how good you sound.This metronome specifically came recommended by my guitar teacher because it reliably produces a strong, clear, beat. So far, it hasn't disappointed. If you don't need extras like a built-in tuner or headphone jack, then I think this is a great purchase.Also, it's good to note that the metronome looks very reddish-brown in the photo, but it's more of a dark brown in reality."
5,Awesome!,"As a pro entertainer for 44 years, I can say this is the best 12"" 2-way speaker I've owned, and I've owned all the name brands. I own 4 of these. Clean, light weight, and unbelievable sound reproduction.A bit pricey but you get what you pay for... I recommend a power amp if you're going to drive 4. You will be knocked out with the sound. Be sure you have enough power to drive these..."
5,Real Ultimate Asscrack Cleaner,"Yes the book arrived and on another note I had an enormous curry with extra chilli last night and now I have done a big one all over my office and my pants are dirty and this book has enough pages BOTH to clean up the enormous humming mess of the slick of my own personal sewage AND also to wear as brand new knickers. That's why I am so cool right now, so cool it really hurts my secretary and especially in her face."
2,Not for anyone over 12,"This book was either written by a teenager or an adult that never grew up. The premise seemed reallty funny, but I couldn't get past the immature narrative as presented byt he author. I love immature moives and stuff, but this book was too much."
5,Joy Delayed,"I have read this book before, and I decided I wanted my own copy. Well, This really hasn't worke out so well. Amazon says that it usually ships within 24 hours, which, for me at least, is not true. I ordered this Febuary 8th, and it still hasn't shipped, and seeing as it is now March 4 I am a little upset about it."
5,Much funnier than the website,"I guess if you're a total idiot/moron with a brain the size of a potato chip, you might think the book is less than sweet. But then again, you probably think your hairy mom is sweet. So you are confused and dumb. The book STARTS where the website leaves off, and it tells the whole story of Robert Hamburger and his family, his babysitter, his dog Francine, his friend Mark, and lots more. So no thank you for being retarded, dummy."
5,10 foot boner,Book has what the website does but is MOSTLY NEW MATERIAL.Every inch is excellent. Buy it for everyone you know. This is TRUE ninja stuff.
4,boners,"This book is very one-of-a-kind. I bought the book because that website was truly laugh-out-loud hilarious, and wanted to support whoever it was behind my hours of enjoyment. What I got was more laugh-out-loud hilarity, but also a fairly serious depiction of young boy with social problems. Although I know Robert Hamburger is a fictional character within his own work, whoever it is who actually wrote the book seems to have deep insights on the experience of a troubled childhood. The serve to make the rampant boner jokes less hilarious, more troubling, but still unforgetable. I especially like how he frenches his dog."
4,"Book more intelligent than website, but also disheartening","When I first came upon the website for realultimatepower, I was tickled pink by the excessive, jubilant and arbitrariness of the humor. I would many times throughout my work month visit the site for some comic relief.The book however, stands in stark contrast to the website and I would categorize it much more under dark humor, than under the silly humor i previously perceived on the website.The book is essentially a psychoanalytical document of a young, troubled child. The subject of the book uses ninjas as a sublimitory cover for the great deal of stress in his life including parents and teachers who do not know how to offer this child emotional support and dealing with the fact of having few friends and a compounding sense of isolation and loneliness.I didn't sign up for this when I bought the book, but I certainly can appreciate the intelligence of the humor even if it did spoil my appreciation of the website."
5,"More than a ""just chuckles"" book","For those of you looking for a ""just chuckles"" book, this isn't for you. As with the last reviewer, this wasn't for her. The reason the book is so good is because it's so different from anything that's out there. It's a social commentary disguised as a tragic memoir disguised as a clever parody disguised as post modern poopy humor disguised as a guide to the ninja. Many will criticize the book because they don't understand it--perhaps they are too stuck into the same old same old. ""Hmm, I don't understand this, so I don't like it."" If you like simple easy going stuff, the book can give you that. But it's going to give you A LOT more. If you're willing to try to understand this penetrating work, you'll be rewarded with much more than a ""just chuckles"" book. I would teach this to my college English course, if they wouldn't kick me out for doing so!"
5,This book just might be the coolest thing ever,"I already knew ninjas were awesome. I'd been to the site like 13 trillion times. What I didn't expect was the swiftness/genius that this book was wrote with. I'm serious. It's like the website, but written even better, if that's even possible. Yeah. Buy it."
2,Not worth it.,"It had no set storyline, just a bunch of diary entries. I enjoyed maybe 20% of the book.I expected a book full of stupid humour, but there was very little of it.If you want to read a lonely teenage kids diary, go for it.If I could go back in time, I would not have purchased it."
3,Stupid But Funny - That's the Point,"I bought this for one reason... to get my order up so I could get free shipping. It's meant to be written by a kid who loves ninjas (and who doesn't love ninjas) and is somewhat along the vein of askaninja.com but not quite as ... ahem ... sophisticated. I did catch myself laughing out loud a few times, so right there, the book is worth it for me. Of course, some of it is dumb but I've never read any book that I totally loved, front to back. Neither of them. It's cheap, it's funny, and is good ninja training material for when all ninjas are called up to save the world."
3,Citadel Press is only out to cash in on a popular website,"Yes the website and book are hilarious. But let's face it. Robert would not have been able to get this book printed if his site didn't get so many hits. In fact the publisher didn't even bother proof reading the book (yeah it was written by a kid) but it still should not have three spelling errors per page. I have to give the kid props for getting a book published but there is no way in hell anyone else can write so poorly and still get published. Maddox is going to write a book, look forward to that... at least he knows how to write."
1,I didnt like it.,He wasnt very polite and my mom did not like me reading the book but i did i can and i dont understand why he wants to kill people my mom said he isgoing to hell and that god will kill him
5,Don't be a little baby-baby/crabby mom....BUY THIS BOOK!!!!,"Fans of RUP already knew this book would be total sweetness. Sometimes I'm not sure what's funnier. The RUP site/book or these friggin' retards who take RUP seriously and fear that people will flip out and talk to hippos or stab someones feet off. You people are jackasses x 34690860.This book contains everything from the site plus a WHOLE lot more. This is the funniest book I have ever read and I laughed out loud through every page. I really hope that there is a follow up.If you have been living in a cave chalk full of hippos for the last 6 years and have no idea what RUP is, you should check out the site for starters at www.realultimatepower.net. If you dig it as much as the rest of the world show your support by getting a t-shirt or something.Long live RUP! (and down with the single mother of 3)"
5,"Dangerous? Lighten up, people.","First of all the town of Mutton, SC does not exist. I checked the South Carolina state government website and it is not listed. Second, if you check the adress bars of the ""MSN News Stories"" Mr. Hamburger posts on his website, they are hosted on his own webspace. They are clearly NOT MSN articles, non of the links on these pages even work! To call this book dangerous is idiotic. It was written to be funny! How can anybody take stuff like this seriously? It's not educational, It's hilarious!"
5,"if you are who I think you are, you'll love this","Some people might not “get it” and that’s ok. But if you are a kindred spirit I can personally guarantee that you will laugh your freakin’ butt off. This book is every bit as funny as the website (and then some). Relax and surrender yourself to the fantasy world of Robert Hamburger or you’ll never make it. If anything just enjoy the subtle, yet genius use of language. You know, it’s not easy making something supremely funny out of extreme stupidity, but if you can, your name must be Hamburger."
5,Ninjas are amazing.,"Robert Hamburger is a genius. His writing style is amazing even to the most cunning of linguists and they are baffled enough to even call him a liar. If you are a ""stupid idiot"" and don't understand what Real Ultimate Power really is, than you might as well get your head CUT off by a TOTALLY SWEET NINJA!!!Thank You Robert,Tanner Robinson"
1,The Absolute Worst Book Ever Written!,"DO NOT BUY! WASTE OF MONEY! Great title, could have had some interesting discussion but it is written by a 8 year old with a dirty mind. Complete rubbish!"
2,"If you've read the website, you don't need the book.","I am a Real Ultimate Power fan. I have read the website and found everything from the hate mail to the seppuku methods to be hilarious, but after going through the book, the joke became a bit tired. This is because the book is just more of the same joke, and in some cases, the exact same material copied from the website.Since it's really the same thing as the website, I can only recommend this book to people who haven't been to, otherwise you've already read the joke."
2,This kid is a loser,"""Robert's"" real name is Kyle and he goes to my school. He is so stupid. PIRATES RULE!!! Ninjas have no boners at all and kyle has no idea what he is talking about if you ask me. Ninjas are cool but a pirate has way cooler weapons and awesome boats. Ninjas all where the same dumb outfit that looks like pajamas. One time kyle bit my teacher and then totally flipped out and ran down the hallway top speed!"
1,Don't waste your money.,The biggest waste of time and loose change. This book wasn't worth sending back for a refund. Went right into the trash.
1,"Personify excrement & have it squeeze a book out, this is it","This book is so bad I think the author is nuts. I think the only way he could wriote this is if his mom go pregnant with him by sitting on some retard's special sock at the laundry mat and that messed him up. And another thing ninjas do not flip out. I dont think Robert Hamburger could track anything down like he says he can except for a can of crisco and a blow-up doll.This book is terrible for filling up our children's minds with this junk. He should just move to France and get out of here. Fujita and Pirates are way better than him. Join me in asking Amazon to take this book off their site! And I dare him by his ""ninja code of honor"" to present his case why he should not take his book back."
1,Real Ultimate Junk,"The author has no knowledge of ninjutsu or ninjas at all, and all his ridiculous stories about ""boning"" girls and ""totally flipping out and killing people"" are lame. He claims to be a ""ninja expert"" after watching several movies and is ""a black belt in Mortal Kombat 3."" This book is probably the worst I have ever read, as he knows nothing about the subject and most of the book encourages young kids to go ""flip out"" and beat up on each other. Save your money and buy your kid a book to learn off of instead of this garbage. The fact that the book has just come out and already there are 6 of them being sold used should tell you that its not worth the money."
1,Are you an impressionable moron?,"If so this book is for you. if not you can safely skip this ""book"" and save your brain cells."
1,"if you want to learn about ninjitsu, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","The author if this book also created a site where he misinformed many people, telling them ninjas ate burgers, flip out and kill people and commit suicide when they are ""really pissed"". This is an insult to the art of ninjitsu and another sad example of what the future generation of America is going to be. Because of this book, I have lost respect to the American people and the way they spend their time"
1,"Personify excrement & have it squeeze a book out, this is it","Personify excrement & have it squeeze a book out this would be it This book is so bad I think the author is nuts. I think the only way he could wriote this is if his mom go pregnant with him by sitting on some retard's special sock at the laundry mat and that messed him up. And another thing ninjas do not flip out.

And I dare him by his ""ninja code of honor"" to present his case why he should not take his book back"
1,This is the Napolean Dynamite of Books - STAY AWAY,"I think I have actually lost almost 20% of my brainpower from reading this book. From reading the cover it looked like it might have the potential to be funny, but oh how horribly wrong I was. Let me go ahead and spoil this book for anyone that has not read it yet...1. Robert Hamburger is a young boy, I would guess approximately 8-10 years old.2. He likes to make out with his dog and give local animals ""erotic massages"" (in his own words)3. Almost half of this book is devoted to boners and how ninjas can use those boners to kill people.Now that I've ruined it for everybody, I hope that this book and it's author die a horrible horrible death."
1,Wow,"I can't believe all the great reviews this book got. I guess my sense of humor is missing something? This book is boring, dumb, childish, not clever, not original (in the sense that the kid next door can write a book like this, but this book does uphold its originality of being the lamest book). The end"
5,simply breath taking!,"When I saw this book on the bookshelf I knew that I had to buy it. I am horribly glad I did. I also have to say that any martial artist who hates this man because of his writing obviously does not know the final goal of martial arts training.Robert, You are one of the funniest people I know!"
5,This book CHANGED MY LIFE,Thanks to Robert Hamburger I've moved into a dumpster and jump out and go nuts and cut off anybodys head who tries to throw crap in my house. I also pork about 500 hot babes a day!!!
5,This book is freaking sweet.,I read a few pages a day for stress relief and it never got old for me. I freaking loved it. There was one point that I was laughing so hard that I had tears streaming from my eyes! If you don't like this book it's probably because your a pirate or a school teacher.
5,you people are too literal,"This was the funniest book I ever read! Those people that say it promotes violence and pagan crap and stuff are retarded. His description of ninjas is as true as it is to be taken seriously. If you think this is a serious book, you have no right to review this. IT'S A HUMOR BOOK FOR GOD'S SAKE!!! Anyways, I love this book! All my ninja friends think it's good too."
2,Not as funny as the Website,"I got this book because I laughed my arse off after reading the website. When I mean lmao I mean every word on the site is hilarious and his style is borderline genius. The book, however, is not as funny. For one, he pulls a lot of the same jokes from the site and tries to resell them in the book - i.e. the ninja scripts, the index page, etc. Cheap trick buddy. Second, once you realise it's not a ten-year old kid writing but in fact a 35 year old philosophy major reject, you just feel bad for the guy. Most importantly, the style just wears thin. REad too much of it and you lose the sponataneity that is Robert Hamburger. It's kind of like sitting through 10 Jim Carrey movies. AFter a point, you just say enough is enough, this ain't funny."
4,Great!!!,This book made it's way around my camp while in Iraq. Everyone I know got a fun laugh out of the seriousness that isn't really there.
5,I'm so pumped I almost kicked my mom in the face!,"This book is quite possibly one of the funniest I have read. I never knew ninjas were so kickass! This book is a riot and hard to put down , but only for those with a sense of humor. Douchebags that think they are ninjas should not read this."
4,Dear Stupid Idiots:,"This book is entertaining to the same part of you that laughs at people when they fall down, etc... It's silly humor, nothing more. So enjoy it for what it is and don't take it too literally.I thought the book was hilarious, personally. It's something you have to be in a certain mood to read: The mood to laugh at something so ridiculous that it's funny.Funny idea for a book. I'm actually impressed that Mr. Hamburger was able to fill so many pages with nonsensical information about ninjas. Definitely an entertaining read, though."
3,Fun toy ... even for adults,"The colors are vibrant and the pieces are sturdy. However the tray is very flimsy and approximately a 1/4 inch too big; this is a big deal when you are creating and the pieces aren't fitting together tightly, not to mention it feels like it will not last as long as the actual pieces."
5,Contentment,"This is an issue prevalent in American culture today as we are inundated with the messages of more, more. It struck me at the heart level immediately that I must change the way I view my blessings. VERY convicting and valid. Author's perspective is very well rounded as having lived in other cultures as well. Love it! Highly recommend this book."
5,Wonderful Study,"This is a great individual study but I think it's even better used with a small group. It's very real and practical. It hits you right where you live. One of Dillow's best quotes is this: ""Worry is like a rocking chair, it will keep you busy but won't get you anywhere."" That's just an example of the wisdom you'll find in this little gem of a book."
5,Great book,I purchased this book for my women's Bible study and we have all been very pleased with it. Linda Dillow has great Bible-based insights! She integrates personal stories throughout which keep the ideas she presents very real and relatable. The study questions in the back of the book are challenging. I'm learning a lot. Very good book and highly recommended!
4,A thought provoking look at who is in control of our life.,"A excellent book that views being contempt with all the blessings that god has given to women. It teaches a women to appreciate life as a precious gift of god. That also, it is god in control and he blesses us with many gifts. Greed is analized and it isn't how much material things that one has but being happy with what god has given you!The book is also a bible study with several references to the bible in it. I would recommend it to any women looking for a deeper fulfilment and understanding of thier life."
5,Calm my Anxious Heart,"This book is amazing! It puts your focus on the positive in our lives, instead of all the things we could and do complain about. It teaches you, if you allow God to, to keep your thoughts on the things that are lovely and pure and honest.I would recommend this for a small group as well as just someone who needs their Heart to be calmed."
5,Calm My Anxious Heart,Great book for a Womens Study Group. Really makes you think about your lifes choices. Arrived in only 2 days!
5,A great motivator and an easy read,"I was pleasently suprised by this book. It is easy to have this book recommended to you, or even to have someone give it to you and leave it sitting on your shelf. I did that when I first received it. Don't do that! Read it and see if you can grow and glean from it as so many of us have done. It can really help you move beyond worry to trust, and it builts more than just anxiety-free living. It helps accomplish the opposite -- contentment and acceptance of your lot. If you struggle with worry or discontentment, this is the first book I would recommend. I can't say that enough! This book helped me get through a very difficult time a while back. In the time since, I have occasionally felt the anxiety levels creep back up, and I have come back to this book. It isn't one to be read one time, but is worth reading again and again."
4,It does what it says it will,"For anyone who is overly anxious, known by all as ""the worrier"", or who is kept up late at night wondering how to fix or solve this, that, and the other, then this is THE book for you.Linda Dillow's ability to convey how we can trust God in all situations is inspired.This book is a tool against the frustrations of the modern world we live in, once you've read it, you will know how to calm your anxoius heart. Ms. Dillow's words can truly be life changing."
5,LINDA DILLOW WORKS SPIRITUAL MAGIC,"LINDA DILLOW'S ""CALM MY ANXIOUS HEART"", IS A SOOTHING INSPIRATION, A DIVINE COMBINATION OF SCRIPTURE, FEMININE INSIGHT AND ANECDOTE. MY BIBLE CLASS AND I LOVED IT."
5,Calm My Anxious Heart,"This is an excellent book that taught me a lot about contentment and surrendering my worries to God, during a time when I was going through some serious anxiety."
1,Extremely dissatisfied!,Very unhappy! I don't know if I will ever buy another kindle book ever from here!Ther are references in the book to go to a certain page number....but when u go to that page number.....it's the wrong page number! The numbers don't match kindle to to the actual physical book page numbers don't match.....VERY frustrating. But worse than that?.....when I call customer service...NOT helpful at all!!! And no resolve!
3,Couldn't get into this book,"I never actually read this book. I tried to read it but it was very hard to get into. I actually got three of her books at the same time and none of them did anything for me. I would say to try it and see for yourself if it works for you. It is actually in my back bedroom in the ""eventually read"" book pile. This is just my opinion though."
5,A Must Read for Anyone Who Struggles with Fear or Anxiety,"I absoloutely LOVED this book!! Linda Dillow shares so many personal examples of how she has dealt with anxiety in her own life and the principles that the Lord has shown her on how to overcome fear and anxiety. I highlighted so many points in this book. I will be reading it again and again, I am sure. Every woman should have a copy of this book. I will be sharing this book with other ladies that I know. 5 ++++++++++ stars!!"
5,Simply Wonderfully Fantastic!!!!,"This is by far, one of the best books I have ever bought. Great for worrying about small things as well as handling the big stress items (i.e. death, serious illness, etc.). I loved it so much I bought several female friends and family members their own copy! I've read my own copy several times. If you're looking for a way to cope and a place to turn to, use this with your Bible, you won't be disapointed."
5,Finding Peace in Anxious Moments,"Have you ever felt like you had no control over what is going on? Have you ever wondered how to deal with life when it's not going your way? In this book, _Calm My Anxious Heart_, Dillow gently reminds us to go to God's Throne. It is such easy reading and very difficult to put down! I gave this to a dear sister in the Lord currently serving in Iraq and she absolutely loves it--and is planning to send a copy to her mother. This book really encouraged our whole women's bible study, too! There is a great bible study in the back of the book with thought invoking questions--either for group or individual study. A keeper--and a great book to share!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Calm Your Anxious Heart,"This is one of the best books I have ever read on knowing God better and who He is to me. Great helps to improve my life and to help rid my life of most stress. Of course we always will have some but how we handle it can make it much easier. Our book group all love it and some have read way ahead. Its one of the best books we have done second only to ""Bad Girls of the Bible"" that and Real Bad Girls of the Bible were also awesome."
5,Life changing,This book was an answer to pray. It has helped me live my faith and have peace within. I loved the book so much I have bought 10 additional copies to give friends that are all going through rough times in their lives also. Most all of the people I have given the book to think the book is a wonderful help.We are thinking about using it in one of our ladies Bible classes.
1,Douchebagbookwrittenbyadouchebag,My favorite part is that she doesn't admit about being in a band called the Wildcats when she was young.
1,DON'T READ: BOOK STINKS,"The content of this book makes no sense. I could hardly finish it. The droll opinions make absolutely no sense. Parents, watch out for the star of david. A jewish religious symbol is your ticket to heck. I censored that one just for you Tipper. Tipper Gore is an off her nut radical and needs to simply be quiet and sit down. ROCK OUT CENSORSHIP!!"
1,Illogical criticism of D&D,"The most notable feature of this book was a chapter concerning Dungeons and Dragons. It states that there are more than 50 suicides per year because of it (????), and that it is satanic. I have experience with D&D and it is nothing of the sort"
4,Great camera for the money,"I bought one of these to go with an underwater housing I got cheap from Amazon.uk It works great, the movie on it is 640x480 with something like 30fps. Looks like normal camcorder footage and plays great on the cable linked to my tv. Get a 4 gig SDHC card too and you can have up to an hour of top quality video footage (if the battery can last that long?)."
3,Still a little Leary.,"I bought this camera after my brand new fujifilm z5 was stolen out of my purse. I decided to try a new brand and from reading the reviews i thought that this would be the best choice. I charged it up last night, and today took some pictures of myself and family members and was dissapointed. The picture quality was not that good, and my family members faces looked blotchy and greasy. I was not happy with it, and am considering returning it."
2,Not What I expected,I actually have this still on my shelf collecting dust. It was not what I expected on the DVD. It was more of a step by step video & not for me.
4,The story of the Prophet Muhammad,"This is a 42-minute program from A&E;'s ""Biography"" series. Like the ""Biography"" program on Moses, it isn't a biography precisely. Rather, it's a presentation of the traditional Muslim story of the life of Muhammad, with commentary by scholars who are Muslim or sympathetic to Islam (including two of the usual suspects, Karen Armstrong and John Esposito). The film honors the Muslim tradition of not depicting Muhammad or members of his immediate family.This program does a good job of bringing the story of Muhammad to life. I've used excerpts from it in teaching classes on world religions.This program is included as a ""bonus feature"" on the DVD ""Secrets of the Koran"" (a good history of the Koran and its interpretation).If you'd like a more detailed version of the story of Muhammad, I'd recommend the movie ""The Message."""
5,Outstanding Mix of 50s-60s Atlantic Soul,"This CD is a collection of Atlantic and ""blue label"" Stax songs covering soul in a rocking style. The original version of ""Some Other Guy"" by Richard Barrett is a particular highpoint! This is a great collection for dancing, and unlike some of these ""Northern Soul"" collections, vary tempo and rhythm. If you bought ""Chess Club Rhythm and Soul"" this makes a fine companion volume."
4,How about a track list? Here 'tis!,This review applies to CD number KRB 5400-2.There are no liner notes.Track list:1. Tenderness - General Public2. A Girl Like You - Smithereens3. Always Something There to Remind Me - Naked Eyes4. True - Spandau Ballet5. Rapture - Blondie6. Too Shy - Kajagoogoo7. Let's Go All the Way - Sly Fox8. Suddenly Last Summer - Motels9. She's a Beauty - Tubes10. Missing You - John Waite
4,No Age Limit,"bell hooks and Chris Raschka have teamed together again to create another memorable book for children, young and old. I read this book last week in preparation for a children's African American Read In. I enjoyed it. Some of the language (words) in the middle and in the end could have been streamlined, but overall I highly recommend that every parent buy this book and make it a permanent addition to their home library. Parents of all cultures and skin colors will appreciate the universal message of acceptance and worth, a message that speaks to the universal heart."
5,Review from Books That Heal Kids,Ever wanted to open a discussion up with a child or a classroom about skin color? Diversity? Then this is your book! It is so beautifully written. I fell in love with Skin Again the moment I read it. I work as a school counselor and I was overcome with such an exciting feeling when I thought about sharing it with children. It's a book that helps children understand that we are more than just our skin color. What counts the most is what is within. Children soak up this message because that is how they are built. They are born to love and accept others. This book is a lovely reminder of that. Find room on your shelf for it.
2,not durable Chase-Durer,"I bought a little different version of this same watch about 6 years ago in USA, and in about 2 years the spring inside the start-stop button broke. It just did not work. I repaired here in Korea and in about half a year it broke again. Its price then was quite lower than now, being about $180. As others told, the watch is very handsome, looks nice, but the construction is not durable at all.However the luminant hands work very well. The light last for hours in the dark, contrary to what is told in another review. So I understand there may be some different versions of it or it just changed as its design did a little."
2,Make sure you check the book!,Must be some 'quality control' issues at the publisher. Make sure you have all pages. I was missing multiple pages.Content if book is good.....just need all of it!
5,Amazon ripoff,"The product is amazing. After a full day in the sun your face/skin feels fresh and not oily. However, you should just go to CVS or another pharmacy to buy it because its cheaper than getting it on Amazon. Oh and Jake it does have active ingredients listed."
5,The Best!,This product is truly amazing! The stiffness of the bristles is just right and allows me to either brush very gently or a bit harder as my tongue adjusted to regular cleaning. I've tried many other tongue brushes and they are simply too soft and don't clean my tongue nearly as well. The fact that there is no scraper associated with this brush is also a plus. I have tried the scrapers as well they don't do the job and I've also read that they actually damage the tongue if the user is not careful. Also I like the fact that it's wide. Great design TUNG! Thank you sooooo much.
5,Tung brush praise,I have a large family and both my wife and kids have used the Tung brush and LOVE it. Practical shape makes the rear of the tongue easy to reach and it's cost effective for the whole family. The mouth is the biggest germ gatherer and the Tung brush takes care of that issue plus bad breath gone all in 60 seconds.
1,Made my tongue bleed,"I absolutely adore the Tung gel and have been using it forever, simply putting it on my regular toothbrush after brushing my teeth.I tried the Tung brush once, and it quickly ended up in the trash can. It is way too strong for my tongue, making it bleed, and extremely sensitive for several days after using it.Yes, cleaning my tongue with a regular brush does make me gag every now and then when I reach too far back, but trust me, it's a lot less pain in the butt than being uncomfortable from the scratches on your tongue from this brush, for days."
1,Horrible,"The tung brush is crap.That's not even for lack of better words.This product doesn't do what it says it does.You can get the same effect from a tooth brush.Sure a toothbrush isn't nearly as wide, but it does the same job.Recommendation: The Ora brush.Thanks,Bucky Wilson[...]"
2,"Wasn't what i expected, but learned some random facts.","When i first read the title of this book i assumed it was a basic review of american history. Well it actually refers to, and maybe this is obvious, the beginning of American History.The book starts with Ancient Greek civilizations and goes through the various eras in European History- it doesn't even mention Columbus until over halfway through the text.The writing isn't particularly strong and the structure is completely erratic. However, the author squeezes novelty facts throughout the chapters. This information is random and useless but also mildly amusing.Do not read this book expecting to pick up general knowledge or anything relevant.. I would not recommend this book to read, but it's free so if you're really craving some random sporadic ancient history that's poorly written and irrelevant, download.It's free, so if you hate it no biggy :)"
2,Not what I expected,"This is not a bad read, just not what I had in mind. It is the story of American History before it gets interesting in my opinion. If you like the 1600s you will love this book."
4,Great introduction,I would recommend this we to any individual looking to see an almost unbiased account of the start of American colonization. It's an easy read
2,Not made well enough,"In theory, these are great cards. And for the first hour that my little boy used them, they were great. But after the first hour, the cardboard started to give along the points where the pieces join. So, every time my little boy tried to pick one up to show us how well he'd done, the piece would fall out. He became extremely frustrated because he wanted the cards to stay whole, and the pieces simply wouldn't do so. Which caused him to not want to play with the cards, and so made them useless as a learning tool. He had been so excited initially. To see him in tears because the cards wouldn't stay joined was just heartbreaking. I do see that there are wooden ones available through another manufacturer and am going to give those a try. Maybe the wood will stay in shape easier than the cardboard did."
4,U-BOATS!,Well made actual footage. Be depth charged! And torpedo a boat! Just like your there.A great DVD for any collection.
4,Airtex E8011 Electric fuel pump,More specific in stating FIRST and CLEARLY it is a 6 Volt pump and not buried far in the description pages.Same applies for the pump pressure output. What is the rated output pressure? Important to know.
2,Less than average,"The opening sequence of this game is brilliant, as a parent it was really enjoyable to both me and my kids. However, we found just about everything else about the game to be less than expected. Perhaps our expectations were too high. I like that the game is non violent - but non violent should not translate to non - action. We have had the game for over a week and it was played for the first few days and that was it. My kids don't have the desire or intention of playing it again. As someone who buys very few games and tries to only buy games that will get a lot of use to justify the high cost, I would not recommend this game."
2,Average,"Not great not bad. Better choices out there but not the worst game our family has ever played.Graphics - 7.5/10Gameplay - 5/10Characters - 7.5/10Sound/Music- 7/10Fun - 5/10The good: Fun characters, non violent, big levels, themeThe bad: Slow starter, collection based game design poorly conceived, lack of action at times, camera.Summary: Lots of games in the past have done what this game does except better."
3,This is a good game that could have been better.,"I got a headache playing this game because of the constantly moving environment. The character should move. Not the word around him. They could take a lesson from Insomniac games makers of Ratchet & Clank. Basically this is a ok platform game.The graphics are good, (I just wish that they stood still) but sometimes the camera angles are horrible. It's hard to see where you're going at times. It has it's challenges but is not too difficult. The game is a bit short too. All in all it's a ok game but I wish I would have rented it first. I don't think that I would have bought."
2,Poor,"There seems to a high number of positive reviews on Amazon with regard to this game. Not to question the integrity of these posts, I would strongly caution anyone thinking about the purchase of this game to rent it or at least do some research on the internet. We purchased the game and were very sorry we did not look into the game prior to purchase. We read and listended to many of the posts here and after playing firmly disagree. While not a horrible game, it is not very good either.www.gamerankings.com is a site that has tons of reviews from different sources. Tak is reviewing medium to low."
1,Dumb game,This is so dumb i could rip this game in half LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont Buy this game It Sucks
5,This game is incredible- graphically speaking,This game is a lot of fun. My neighborhood gets together often to see if they can beat Tlalloc sp? ! The graphics on this game can't be topped on any platformers. The game mechanics are awesome as well. Like you get to ride a rhino for some game play. The game's one fault is the camera action. All in all i would give this game a nine as it is a game that continues to get played and not shelfed.
3,The dog enjoyed it...,I have a Chihuahua and she weighs in at 3.5 pounds.She had the stuffing out of this toy in less than 24 hours.Although she still enjoys the outter shell there is no stuffing left to it.
1,Waiting for a purchase,It was expected I receive the stuffed animal for my dog last week and I still haven't got it!!pretty disappointed
3,What's in a name,It's a nice little stuffed animal but don't let the name brand KONG fool you. It didn't last any longer than any other stuffed toy with my pit/lab mix puppy. Probably good for little dogs only.
3,Not indestructible after all...,"It's a cute toy, but it didn't stand up to my terrier...though it did last a couple weeks. Maybe my dog is just exceptional, but for those of you with other ""exceptional"" dogs who are trying to find that toy that will last...this one didn't for me."
5,Practically Indestructable...,"My Jack Russell Terrier puppy loves this toy. He has tried his best to ""kill"" it, to no avail. Dr. Noy's toys are almost indestructable. I like the fact that there are no pieces to break lose or come off this toy which could be dangerous to a puppy who likes to put everything into his mouth.This is one great toy, at a reasonable cost, which has provided my puppy with hours of amusement and exercise. I highly recommend this toy."
4,Beagle loves this!,"Having a 3 year old beagle that has destroyed toys in 3 minutes or less after receiving them, I'm always on the lookout for one she will like, and that will last longer than a bullrider does.This toy is one of my beagle's favorites! She fell in love with this critter! She loves the squeaky in its head, and will carry it around in her mouth. We don't let her have it when she's home alone, since I don't want her to get bored and chew her way through to the squeaker, but otherwise, it's held up wonderfully. We also don't let her play 'pull' with it. It comes with a replacement squeaker, which is nice.It's the perfect size for our beagle, and almost the perfect toy. If the size we received is 'medium', I wouldn't order anything smaller for any dog except a Chihuahua. I hope to find some more!"
4,It's still in one piece,"My dog loves to go directly for the squeaker in any toy, but she can't get to this one. She tosses it everywhere and likes to play tug-of-war with it."
1,Poor Mr. Bear,The frog and duck toys held up so well that I decided to get the teddy bear (it is SO cute). Poor Mr. Bear doesn't last a day. My dog is 12 pounds and it is so incredibly easy to chew the limbs off these guys. My dog gnawed off the leg of one of the bears so we bought him a new one (what were we thinking?) He gnawed off another leg. We duct taped it back on and he gnawed through the duct tape. Cute toy for small pups if they aren't big chewers but my dog is just determined to eat this thing.
1,"If I could give toy a negative 2 stars, I would.","My 19 lb. Boston Terrier loves stuffed toys, but only to pull out the stuffing. So, I usually buy stuffing less toys. I decided to give this toy a try based on reviews about how tough it is. Well an hour later the toy is destroyed.I'll go back to buying stuffing less toys. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,KONG FAIL: It lasted about an hour,"Okay KONG is known for creating some pretty tough, ready to take wear and tear items.This is not one of them.I was looking for a plush like toy my 20 lb dog could play with...they say there's not that much stuffing in it. KONG did not have to pick it up from all over the apt.Said brown bear was stripped and gutted in about an hour.Skip this one."
3,never seen it again,"arrived as stated gave it to my Eskimo spitz he took of with never seen it again, no fur no nothing"
2,Cute but not durable,"My dog who is an aggressive chewer recieved this for Christmas and within an hour had one of the feet pulled off. He did love it and carried it around the house squeeking its head but, within two days the squeeker in the head was pulled out. They did have the head squeeker sewed into a fabric pouch so I was able to retrive it before it was chewed/swallowed. I didn't bother to put the extra squeeker in the body. Would not recommend this toy for a dog who tears apart stuffed animals, it didn't last more than a couple days."
1,Disappointing!,"I have a 5 lb yorkie who LOVED this toy immediately. For 48 hours he wouldnt stop playing with it. Normally if I walk to another room or outside, he will follow me or cry. With this toy, he wouldnt move. I was elated he had a toy he loved so much. Highly disappointed when on day 3 I noticed not only was it coming apart, but the squeaking insert was also no longer working. I know this is as a fairly inexpensive toy but no one wants to buy a toy that lasts two days. I really want to buy him another one since he loved it but I refuse to keep buying him new toys every few days! I expected better from KONG!"
5,My dog loves this,"My dog is a big chewer and she loves this bear, they are cheap so i bought a few and can replace when she crews it so much that it is time..."
1,The bear in the picture is NOT the one you get!,"This toy is TINY and not worth the price. If my small dog picks it up, the entire bear is in her mouth. A huge disappointment."
3,not tough enough,"My eleven month old pit bull loves to rip apart stuffed dog toys to get at the squeaker, and sadly this toy didn't last too much longer than the others. She got the squeaker out in about an hour (vs. the usual fifteen minutes), so it didn't really work. It does have less stuffing which is nice, and the seams are a bit better, but if your dog is as tenacious and strong as mine, she'll shred it in no time."
1,A very small and dangerous toy.Don't buy.,"This toy is much too small to be safe for a dog, any size of dog. It is easily destroyed by a small dog and the very small pieces could be swallowed causing a very dangerous situation for your pet. Try the AKC brand of dog toys, they are well-made and much less risly for your beloved pet."
3,Unaware,"Unaware this did not come with the KONG in it, will be good once I get a KONG to go in it but I live an hour away from a pet store"
2,not german shepherd proof!,"I bought this because it was from Kong and the reviews were good. It did not last more than ten minutes before my dog ripped it apart. It was also smaller than I thought, only six inches tall. Its nice that there isn't any stuffing to pick up. My dog loved it though. But this is probably only good for small dogs."
2,NOT Durable,I bought this toy because most KONG toys are durable. This bear lasted about 10 minutes with my small German Shepherd female. First she tore off both ears then the nose. Once she got the nose torn apart it was all over and I took it away. I was looking for an extremely durable plush toy as she is extremely hard on them. This one didn't do it.
2,Torn Easily,This bear is about the size of a small hand. My Dachshund tore it's legs and arms off in a matter of minutes.
1,TINY,"This item was so small, it wasn't worth buying for the price. My dog devoured it in no time. The picture is deceiving."
1,Poor Product,"I just recieved two of the KONG bears today, within 15mins, my heeler (medium sized dog) had the poor bear legless... now, its been just over and hour and all that is left is the head. I bought them hoping they would last more that a week. I also have a Japanese Chin (14lb dog) and he tore the nose off of his bear.. these may work for a yorkie or a dog of that size...."
3,The search continues,"I have a cocker/dachshund mix who is an obsessive chewer. Nothing in this world makes him happier than ripping a toy to shreds. I bought this toy in the hopes that it would hold up to his chewing for at least a few weeks. Sadly, it only took him 2 hours to destroy it completely. Normally, it takes him about 20 minutes to annihilate a toy, so I guess that was a bit of an improvement. So, the search continues for a toy he'll play with that will last more than a few hours."
1,First ever feedback - this product is awful,"In less than 5 minutes, my medium size dog (40 lb) pulled off the tail and an ear. I'm fortunate the dog didn't choke on this - this product is dangerous and not for your dog."
3,Didn't last,"I bought this toy cheap, knowing it would most likely not hold up. We have a Pitt bull who loves to chew soft things. He had this completely torn apart in less than 1 hour. I will say for a smaller dog or a dog who isn't a huge chewer it would have lasted a long time, the construction is done very well."
2,Lasted a day,This one lasted barely an hr before my 10mth old labradoodle pup got into its insides. Another hr and it was a goner. At least there wasn't a big mess due to minimal stuffing. But wouldn't buy it again.
2,Lasted a few seconds,"Though, my dog (70lb GSP) is a chewer. I didn't expect it to last very long. Just thought I'd give it a try."
3,Kong Teddy Bear,"After reading several of the other reviews, I was excited to find a toy that was harder destroy than others. Unfortunately, just like every other toy I have purchased it took my 10 year old Jack Russel Terrier less that 1 minute to get the squeaker out and a total of 5 minutes to remove a leg and the entire face of the Kong bear. Though he likes it and proudly prances around the house with his bear, it's not the durable toy I was hoping for."
3,Whoops,"This product was supposed to be strong enough for chewers. It was not. My doxie puppies thrashed it in a day, so sad and exspensive."
1,Didn't last an hour,"I read the reviews on this product and thought this would be a good toy for my miniature Labrador. He loves to chew and sometimes gets sick eating too many rawhide treats. He loves his stuffed toys, but hates anything with a squeaker. If it squeaks, it must die. So, the first thing I did was remove the squeaker from the inside lambskin bag. I replaced the empty bag inside the bear, secured the Velcro and gave the bear to Buddy. The first thing he did was begin to chew on the Velcro closure. within 20 minutes he had the Velcro ripped off one side and was chewing up the inside bag. I have now replaced the empy bag and sewed the back shut with a strong twine. I give this toy about another hour or two and it will be ready for the trash. I wish someone would make stronger toys for dogs that do not have squeakers but are designed for chewing. Maybe they could use a tough canvas or something. Meanwhile, I'll keep searching for something Buddy proof."
1,NOT DACHSHUND PROOF,"I bought this toy for my mini dachshund, and within 10 minutes she had destroyed it.The ear was gone, and there was a hole the size of a golf ball in the bottom. I give up on trying to find her a squeaker toy that she can't destroy in a very short time."
3,its ok,I am a dog trainer and am against buying toys that squeak for a dog with a prey drive when there are kids in the same house. After the squeakers were taken out there was nothing left in the bear lol
2,destroyed in 3 hours,"My cairn terrier destroys most squeaky toys in less than an hour. Based on the positive reviews on Amazon I bought this hoping it would last months like it had for other reviewers. It didn't. Within a few minutes my pup had part of the bear's fabric ripped off, and in less than 3 hours had the pouch holding the squeaker ripped out of the bear and the squeaker destroyed. He still carries it around, but it doesn't squeak any more. At least it didn't have a bunch of stuffing that I had to pick up."
3,not as durable as i hoped,"I received the bears (bought 2 of them) yesterday and I gave my 9 month old puppy Macie(Pug & JRT Mix) one of the bears. She had the pocket pulled out thru the head where the squeeky is within 30 min or so. She continued to play with the bear but also the pocket and the squeeky is just about destroyed....lol...she has a tendency to destroy every squeeky in a toy, so this doesnt surprise me. A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear. Let's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces. I'm still looking for a toy that she cannot destroy and I haven't found it yet. I think toymakers need to give me the toys to test and then if they survive they can be stamped 'Macie approved'"
3,Please pay attention to the size.,"I have a small chichiuaua (sp) and a llasha apso...I ordered small. It is very very small. Only about 3 1/2 inches from the top off its head to the butt! I will see how my dogs do with it...but, at this point I believe they will tear this apart in no time! Or choke on it!"
3,Meh.,"Our 6 month old whippet/terrier mix puppy was tearing all of his plush toys apart so I bought this teddy bear, encouraged by the reviews and thinking that it would be indestructible. He managed to tear both ears off pretty quickly, and just ripped the head open. Gory, I know, but you deserve to know the truth. It's definitely nice that there's no stuffing for him to eat and make a mess of, but it only provided a couple days of entertainment. Back to my quest to find something non-rubber for my little gentleman to play with..."
1,Meh!!! MEH I say!!!,"Okay, I'm going to be totally honest here. I HATED THIS GAME when I first played it. I had SO much trouble with the solar power thingy. I lost my gun power REPETITIVE times. I have played this game maybe three time and none of those times did I have fun.Once again, MEH! Without having to hold this stupid game up to the sun every waking moment, I would have MUCH more fun with this game!This weekend, I'm selling this game at a local game store. I'll forget I ever bought it.(Please excuse any drama I may have cooked up. I'm a very dramatic person, and I'm proud enough to let it show.)"
4,A 12 year old's point of view,"I own this game and think it is very fun. i have beaten it a few times now. Once you beat it once, you can beat it a million times. Only drawback I can think of is that you need the sun. This can be easily resolved by a using black light, though."
4,great game,"the only drawback is that the sun tends to produce a good amouunt of glare off of my GBA SP, which sorta gives me a headache...but otherwise it's a great game :p"
1,This is a scam to sell supplements to you!,"Ohhh people! Now I remember this author and this ""company"", after reading several of the reviews. DO NOT BUY INTO THIS SCAM!The worst credibility and the worst customer service.I bought the book a few years ago. I bought into the whole scam and set up. I bought the supplement package ""from them"" that they recommended.I took all of the bazillions of oversized supplements they recommended to take daily and I just got extremely tired and felt worse then when I was drinking.What alcoholic does not dream for a vitamin seven week CURE?Answer: A drinking and desperate one. That's all it takes to fall for this scam.My brother, who is a wholistic dr. came to visit me after I had been on the supplement program for 5 weeks. He diagnosed my boby as being more toxic, overloaded, and that I needed to cleanse these scam products out of my body.I did it and felt better.Be smart.Do not buy into it is my advise. Look further, research more."
3,Not for the layman,"Much too complicated for the average person. The overall premise that addiction is not just a ""mental"" problem but can find its roots in the physical is very believeable. BUT the book is more useful in the hands of professionals, not your average drunk. But if you want to go for it....do."
1,This book should be left in the last century!,"Please save your money! Of course, if one wants to stop craving alcohol (metabolized as sugar) one needs to go on a high protien, low carbohydrate diet. A diet like Sugar Busters is what is proposed. And of course, everyone can benefit from vitamins - so buy some and take them! The thing I found offensive about this book was that the author thinks that everyone who has a drinking problem is ""alcoholic"" (an antiquated term!) and that he or she can be defined as one of three or four different ""kinds"" of alcoholic. What a bunch of bunk! Instead of this book buy: Sober for Good and Sugar Busters."
4,seven weeks to sobriety: the proven program to fight alcoholism through nutrition,"although i have not finshed the book yet...i was so excited by just skimming that i falied to send it off to the one i ordered it for. i found the information very logical and deeply supportive...on multiple levels. the loved one who(finally) received the book is equally excited and eager to begin his road to recovery and more importantly wellbeing.as a registered nurse, this book also gives me a great deal of hope for the future wellbeing of many who suffer with addiction/depression/ loss of authentic self. finally an alternative that is physically supportive, which will inturn inspire mental and spiritual wellbeing"
5,Great shelter,"I bought this for a shade for our patio. It is a well made item.The only thing I'm not fond of is the carry bag, it's not a wheeled type like most other brands come with. The customer service is top notch if you ever have a problem with yours. We had damage to ours from the shipping co."
5,Cocoon,The film was just as enjoyable as the first film. It is a must see for those who saw the original feature.
4,Cocoon - The Return,"As a sequel, it was both entertaining and safe for those with young family members. Typical villians in the form of ""G-Men"" but too much government seems to be the normal cry these days."
5,Cocoon,A great escape fare that deals with extraterrestrials visiting earth and then asks the question what if? I loved the original and the sequel too!
4,Great Sci-Fi Combo,Great story and sequel of alien visitors and their interaction with retirees in Florida.For those with a soft heart.
3,"Good acting from oldsters, but bad directing and writing","To get complete enjoyment from this film, DO NOT try to put it into context with the original. The acting from the oldsters was brillant. However, Tahnee Welch seemed to force her self to act convingly, that she wasnt very convincing. The film has its glory moments, Like the hospital scene. And the scene where the seniors and the alien steal the alien from the oceanolgy institute. The hospital scene was very well done, but messed up the intended illusion from the first film. Infact the entire movie messed up the illusion of the first. That illusion was that these people were going to space to live forever. Not that illusion is gone. Wacth this if you want good acting, but for a good story, DONT."
2,Lacks the spirit and magic of first movie,I was disappointed in this movie. I feel it just doesn't compare. It was lame.
5,Cocoon - The Return,"Five years since the senior citizens blasted off into space with the Antareans return to earth because their alien friends have to collect the rest of the cocoons in the ocean, believed to be in danger from an earthquake. Ben and Mary visit their family, while Art and Joe visit Bernie, who's still hangin' on. Art, Ben and Joe had forgotten what it was like on earth and immediately begin to feel their weaknesses, except for Art's wife who's pregnant, meanwhile in the ocean, a biologist company snatched a cocoon out of the ocean and are doing research on it. An enjoyable and harmless sequel to the original. If you liked the original you will most likely enjoy this sequel."
3,"Movie Review ""Cocoon - the Return""","This sequel to the touching film Cocoon is pretty weak in comparison. For those who bought and enjoyed the original Cocoon, this is a ""must have"" for your video collection. Although the original concept is picked up in this sequel, it just lacks the charm and ""warm fuzzies"" we all need, from time-to-time. I would not cut off my arm for this film, but for Cocoon fans, it's worth buying/renting and viewing."
4,Lots of information and very readable,"Each chapter is a short historical description of related discoveries followed by individual descriptions of the elements themselves. There is some repetition in this (which would have been hard to avoid).Marshall has included a huge amount of fact in a small space without the book becoming too text-book like or disjointed.It is both a historical reference and an interesting read and a very good way to get familiar with the elements without ""trying""... so that shiny stuff in the top of valves (vacuum tubes) must be ceasium... and what a curious group the ""rare earths"" are! You really get a feel for the characteristics of the elements and the amazing achievement that the periodic table is."
3,A problem with this dvd,"The other reviewer did a great job of describing this movie, you'll have to accept this old flick with a sense of humor. There is, however a problem on this dvd. There is a hard freeze, a blank spot, and then it jumps into the next scene. I returned one copy of this movie, and Amazon promptly replaced it. Still at 50 min. and 57 sec this movie freezes, flutters, goes blank and then resumes, if you can live with it , ok. I am keeping this second copy, in spite of the flaw, just thought you would like to know ahead of time."
2,Mediocre at Best!,"Did not like this movie at all. Tried watching it, but did not finish. I did not find it funny as some mentioned. The cast was boring for me. The look of the film was not good. It was grainy, with washed out colors. I know this was an old movie, but I have seen better in much better quality. I guess I received a bad dvd.Gave it 2 stars, because Karen Black is a good actress, and I own a couple of her movies. ""Burnt Offerings"", and ""Trilogy of Terror"" are two of her finest horror films in my opinion."
2,Nine Nights with the Taoist Master,"WHen I read the reviews by this book I was very exited when I order. However, I felt the writing and the drama was extremely boring. The author clarify that the history is base on imaginary facts of the time. But the writing did not cut it for me.."
5,Best book on the Tao Te Ching I have ever read.,"I feel this is the best book explaining the Tao Te Ching I have ever read.WaySun Liao has a unique way of telling the true meaning of Tao and Te in a story form. The story is intergrated with the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu. Anyone who studies Taoism, this book is a must. I have studied the Tao Te Ching for years and always felt something was missing. My interpretations have been affirmed. WaySun Liao filled the missing parts of the puzzle. As a practioner of T`ai Chi Ch`uan, I also recommend all his other books. He is a true Master."
1,don't buy it!,"This product is supposedly a re badged Primera product. However it does not come with the same software. The software that comes with it has not been updated since 2009 and will not work with current operating systems. It's totally useless, don't buy it!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"This was not what I expected. It has the JST and KJV side by side for quick and easy comparison, but it does NOT contain the verses that were left unchanged by Joseph, which makes reading it like a normal Bible impossible. It's only practical use is as a reference book for a particular verse of interest, which for the typical user is an impractical and obnoxious method of studying. If the unchanged verses were added, this would be a fantastic book and an excellent buy, but as it stands it is not all that useful."
3,KJV-JST side by side,"This book was written as a reference of JST changes, not as a complete Bible. This book is nice if you want to have KJV and JST side by side. A more complete study reference is Joseph Smith's New Tranlsation of the Bible-Original Manuscripts. For a Bible to READ, get the full-length 1970 Community of Christ version."
5,Clarification,"Reading the reviews here I feel obligated to throw in my two cents. The word ""translation"" as used in reference to this work should not be construed to mean what we typically infer from the word ""translation,"" i.e., to transpose from one language to another. In the context of the Joseph Smith Translation what we have is an inspired editing or revision of the King James Bible, not a translation from the original Greek, Aramaic, or Hebrew. It should not be supposed that Joseph Smith was attempting to bring the King James Version into complete harmony with the original manuscripts. The Joseph Smith Translation should be viewed as more of a bringing-to-light and clarification of principles, concepts, and doctrine within the biblical text of the King James Version."
1,"Heretical ""translation""","There are many things I could write why this is such a heretical book but the easiest thing to notice is that when you look at the author of the book it lists ""Joseph Smith"" which is exactly right. God is NOT the author of this book but Joseph Smith is. He made all these changes to the Bible with no training in Greek or Hebrew and without any of the manuscripts of the original writings. Just as Jesus spoke to the Pharisees and told them that they were making men ""twice as much a son of hell as themselves"" so Jesus would tell Joseph Smith the same thing."
3,"Not bad, not great","Not a bad movie. Movie moves along at a normal pace. The scenery for the movie is quite beautiful. I watched it on Prime, so I didn't pay anything for it, which makes the movie even better."
3,A repeat...,"Dissapoingting at best. This movie tries to mimic the originalThe Blue Lagoon (Special Edition)movie and has virtually the same plot with some tweaks here and there (say civilization has come). The original movie was great, original and interesting. The second movie is a repeat and eh...ok. There is not much originality and the plot is boring and predictable. Castaway children with adult end up in a deserted island. Adult lives long enough to teach them the basics, adult dies, children are alone and grow up together, the fall in love and blah blah blah. See? Same movie."
1,Sophomoric Softcore,"While the original ""Blue Lagoon"" movie was hardly great cinema, this remake of a ""sequel"" is even shlockier, sappier, and cornier than the original... Brian Krause (""Charmed"") is often embarrassing (ie his ongoing antagonism with a shark), but no so much as Mila Jovavich's pouting, simpering delivery. No doubt popular with the baby-sitting teenybopper set, who most likely find the idea of being shipwrecked on a desert island with a ""cute boy"" the height of romance. Perhaps they could lobby for a part three starring Britney Spears & Justin Timberlake..."
1,Pretty Lame,"Yeah, they died. They all died. The old salt had warned them the berries were poison and to never eat them. The toddler ate them first - then mom and dad decided to eat some to - so they could all go together.Now a sequel where the toddler who ate the poisonous berries DIDN'T die.Boo!"
1,Good Film But Why Is It Edited?,I bought this dvd to replace my vhs copy of the film. However when I started watching it I noticed that some of the scenes had been edited and that the rating had been changed from PG13 to PG. If it had not been for the editing I would have given this film three stars. However because it is edited I cannot in good conscience give it more than one star.
4,Return To Blue Lagoon VHS Movie,"Watched the original Blue Lagoon, got the information on IMDB on Return to Blue Lagoon, and ordered it out of curiousity. It followed the lines of the original, but the ending was completely different. I enjoyed both the original and the sequel, for different reasons."
4,Good movie but the original was the best!,"Return to the Blue Lagoon was a nice movie with an interesting story line. The movie starts with the the little boy Richard being rescued and a lady aboard the ship taking care of him like she was his mother. Not to long after the women, Richard and her daughter Lilly have to leave the ship because there is a decease on the vessel. Eventually they end up back at Blue Lagoon where Richard remembers his home. Later in the movie the women, who is mother to Lilly, dies from getting sick. Both Lilly and Richard are left then to take of themselves which they do very well.The thing I found different about this movie from the original is that Lilly and Richard actually meet people on the island from a boat that all of a sudden found its way to their home. This movie is a good movie but the original Blue Lagoon still was the best of the 2."
2,"Worst Case of Sequel Gone Bad, I've Ever Seen.","I recently rented both of these movies at the same time. Big mistake. Obviously, the sequel was never meant to be seen in the company of the original.how can a serious screenplay writer ever even think to end the 1st movie one way, and re-write the 2nd move to completely discount that 1st ending?Given the storyline and the writing of it, you can't blame the actors, but the writers.Brian Krause and the rest of the cast did a great job with what they had to work with; a badly written storyline with too much of the same thing as the original.There was not enough difference in it to make it worth watching.huge disappointment."
1,Why?,"I saw the Blue Lagoon when I was 13 it was risque, the acting was not the best but Brooke was a top model and Chris was gorgeous,I didn't even know that a second movie had been made. I was shopping came across it and bought it thinking, ""wow part 2 maybe they survived and finally made it do san frocisco"". Boy was I disappointed, Milla is gorgeous she makes Brooke look like and ugly stepsister, Bruce although not as handsome as Chris looked ok. But the acting just like the first was horrible. This movie was made just to show off some young hot bodies. It's a rip off of the original but done with less artistic integrity. At least the first movie was gorgeous, pure you felt as if the two kids were truely discovering themselves and each other. This one they are just reading lines from a page. Why was this made?"
4,"Less nude than the sequel, but also less epic.","I just got finished reviewing ""The Blue Lagoon,"" and I said that it was more nude than this sequel, but more moving and poetic. The fact amazes me that both couples (Shields and Atkins, Jovovich and Krause) mate frequently; to them, making love is as natural as breathing, which is of course natural, so sex follows constantly. But this one is PG, the first one R. That is a major rating difference. I gave both movies 4 stars. Just please don't make another porno sequel."
5,Darkhorse version did not disappoint.,"Other than the GL done SW movies, this is the most important series of books in the Galaxy Far Far Away. If i were starting out as a reader of the Expanded Star Wars universe I would not start with Zahn first. I would start with the Han Solo trilogy first.Darkhorse has made some SW books in comics. They gereally do a good job, but not always. They often suffer from poor editing decision. This one is no exception. It is to bad that you can't put the audio (book on tape) casette or CD and play it along with the comic, but you can't. The comic takes to many deletions to fit their page limitations. Still I have to give this 5 stars to reward Darkhorse for the attempt. Wishing DH would do other SW novels... thank you for this one."
3,A totally outdated text,This books main focus is the Afrikaners and the question of the Dutch reformed church adn the shadowy organization known as the Broederbond. But this book is outdated. It gives far too much credence to the so-called power of the Afrikaners. If the Afrikaners are so powerful then why haven't they been able to protect the more then 1000 Afrikaner farmers who have ben murdered since 1991. The reality is that they are powerless to defend themselves against the ethnic cleansing taking place in the Orange Free State and Transvaal and the government has turned its back. Unfortunatly no text will do to illuminate the genocide taking place in S. Africa.Seth J. Frantzman
5,"Better than ""Gremlins,"" better than ""E.T.""","This is my favorite Konrath book. you can pick it up and open a page and read for a minute, and you get more out of it than if you read an entire Chuck Palahniuk book, which has very short sentences. These sentences are long and complicated and contain references to autopsy paraphrenalia and explosives and japanese monsters and obscure sexual practices. You will be amazed at the range of topics covered in ""Rumored."""
5,Great Insight,You will love the blending of the case stories with the conclusions and implications. The book gave our men's study group worthwhile discussion material.
2,Getaway sketches,"2 1/2Semi-engaging techno gets by on some astute layering of various world-music elements, although the beats are a little house-fully disengaging. Pleasant enough for some high energy background or the almighty workout fix."
3,Banco De Gaia - The Magical Sounds Of Banco De Gaia,"Although _The Magical Sounds of Banco De Gaia_ promises a lot with the title, it manages to hit the point about 75% of the time. Sure, Banco de Gaia has always had a slight issue with cheesiness (""I Love Baby Cheesy"" hits the point a bit too on the head), they can also come out with some quite pleasant tracks -- a curious mixture of the silly and the sublime. For instance, the Indian rhythm chant on ""Harvey and the Old Ones"" comes up against a house beat and some whirling electronics. Not a direct hit, but a fair miss. ""Frog's Dinner"" brings back the good ol' days of ambient dub, but it's the slow dreaminess of ""Sinhala"" and the gentle, string-laden ""Glove Puppet"" that make an impression. For a more upbeat track, ""No Rain,"" with its Chinese instrumentation, that gets the heart beating. An imperfect album, but with just enough magic."
3,"An Overall Solid Effort, But....","I find myself drifting off while listening to several of the tracks. 'I Love Baby Cheesy' is certainly a winner and very clever and I don't want to criticize the talented Banco, but, I can't help comparing this sound to the more far reaching efforts of Loop Guru and TransGlobal Underground. Any other electronica effort with dance overtones has to be measured against these 2 groups as I think they are the best I've heard, so far. I'm still waiting for one of these groups to transcend the dance club overtones which I feel cheapen a lot of the work and make the music more monotonous."
5,Excellent Resource on Photography Lighting,Enjoyed the book. It has lots of useful information to help understand the complexities of lighting when doing various types of shots.
4,Clean Fun but ...,"The Hot Wheels World Race game is good, clean fun suitable for younger children. No death or killing, just lots of speed and fun stunts. Many different tracks and cars keep the game interesting. May be worth 5 stars but...Fans of the Hot Wheels Highway 35 worldrace series will be a bit disappointed. Although 35 cars are available on the game and most match the Highway 35 set, not all cars are identical to Highway 35 cars. It was not me who noticed this but my very detail oriented 4 year old. Following a quick comparison with the cars in the set, it appears that the game disguises or changes all cars that originally are based on actual vehicles (like the Ford F-150, the 70 Roadrunner, the Pontiac, etc.)."
5,good game but...,Good game but... didnt work on our ps2 we shouldve looked at the other reviews before we bought it. If you have a wii or gamecube just buy it for gamecube if your Ps2 is the older version.
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,"Make sure you have a newer version of PS2 or you cannot play this game!! My son got it for his b-day and our system (5 years old) could not play the game. You are supposed to send your system into Sony for an upgrade that you have to pay for.Luckily, Toys R US was cool and gave us a credit instead."
4,"Verbose, but interesting","Kanigel does elaborate a little too much on unnecessary subjects (such as Hardy's sexuality), but this book is a interesting look at one of the world's greatest mathematicians of all time.Highly recommended for those that are interested or familiar with the world of mathematics, else this read may be a bit cumbersome."
4,very good book,"Interesting book on the life and times of the math genius Ramanujan. I found the book also interesting as it gave a peek about the world and India during the early 1900s. The author did a great job in researching about Ramanujan, really makes a great effort to take the reader back to those times."
5,Man who knew infinity: Ramanuj,"One of the finest books I have encountered, esp after I came to know about the `modular functions' Ramanujan helped investigate in depth from his `lost notebook'. A mystic sadly taken away in the peak of his genius. The book elucidates the times and conditions [social & political] in the British India thereby giving a diff perspective of the struggle of an extra-ordinary brain."
4,Who'd have thought I'd like a book about math?,"I am not a math whiz. I am not even South Asian. But I loved this book. The story is very compelling, and the math is approachable (I even found myself doodling little formulae, like how to derive the area of a circle...). If you're interested in the story of a very unique man, this is a good place to start."
4,Good biography for the mathematically disinterested,"Ramanujan was a mathematician in Euler's class, that is the sort of mind you see once a century. For those interested by his life in India and at Cambridge University, this book explains the ins and outs of his existence quite well, and a bit else as well.Unfortunately those with a genuine interest in his work really will never get much further than realizing that he was incredibly gifted; perhaps his work was too complicated to describe; perhaps the author didn't want to sacrifice a good narrative to tedious equations.I'd recommend this book to students keen to read about the life of a mathematician, but not necessarily to those trying to get a grasp of Ramanujan's legacy as a mathematician."
4,A Mysterious Life,"Ramanujan is a bit like the Wittgenstein of mathematics: An eccentric genius whose true insights we apparently are still to comprehend.Phenomenal research has gone into this book, and it is filled with a variety of detail. The maths is accesible without being oversimplified. Interesting looks at the culture of the time too, like the saga of Ramanujan's marriage and Hardy's (the English mathematician who helped make Ramanujan famous) repressed homosexuality.Best of all is the exciting mystery of this whole saga. Ramanujan seamed to attract and create drama, and it is intriguing to witness his life progress on the pages."
4,It covers every second of Ramanujan's life,"It is a superb biography, can as well serve as a guide to S.India and Cambridge.It is amazing to see that Kanigel has presented the lifestyle of S.Indians in all its details. No book has been written in India on an Indian mathematician giving utmost attention to even trivial details. The best biography I have ever come across."
1,Long and difficult prose style,"Probably an exciting life; however, it refers back to pre-war I as a begining, seems very old, and is a terribly long book with a very old fashioned, boring writing style. Probably it should serve as THE source book, but for more ordninary people like me (Psychologist with some knowledge of, and interest in ,the history of Mathamatics) this needs to be re-written as a briefer edition( based on the above) by a Reader's Digest Editor. Martin J.Kaplan"
5,Wow,"This is an amazing book about an amazing man, just reading about him makes most math geniuses feel like a complete idiot. If Ramanujan had a proper education in the field, he could have become the greatest mathematician of his time, even greater than Hilbert."
2,If you Like Tangerine Dream Rip-Offs....,"....then you'll love this early sequencer driven cd by Mr. Roach. It sounds like he had been listening to a lot of Tangerine Dream music & went out & recorded this live as a tribute to them. Not bad, but......not real good ""Steve Roach"" music. A lot of build up to NO CLIMAX!!!!!!........whadda ya gonna do???"
2,Movie Stunk,"This movie stunk. Only got this movie because it was supposedly filmed in Lawerence, Kansas. Unfortunately, it was filmed way out in the boon-docks of Lawerence, and that was maybe the first 15 minutes. Was a somewhat confusing movie about Zombies in Utah or somewhere. Did not keep my attention for a movie just over an hour long. If you like old style horror movies, this may be for you."
2,Santa chopper,"When we set this up we found out that it was not new. It has been used and some of the tie down rings on it were rusted and there is a ripped spot in a couple of places but still holds air. We were also short the tie downs and we had to go but more tie downs after spending this high dollar price on this item and it will not stand up straight after blowing up, you have to prop things around it to keep it upright. Very disappointed in this item for the amount of money we spent."
2,"Copyright 1978? It's 2001, and it shows in this book.","This book covers several areas about guitar repair, but only vaguely. It does not go into details that are needed before even trying most repairs. I was hoping to find help on removing binding and fingerboards to replace a truss rod. It touches in these areas, but that is all it does. I still have no clue. I already know the board and binding needs to come off, but how? Not enough info to even try attempting this feat.The book is 23 years old. Something that is not shown on the Amozon.com site before buying it. If you buy this book you're reading history, not up to date facts needed for guitar repair. This is more a reference book from the 60's and 70's and not a repair book at all."
3,complete guitar repair is for builders,"This book is great if you are into BUILDING guitars. But for repair its actually not all that helpfull. Most of the things gone over in this book are about how to make a guitar, which is cool. But not what i was looking for since the title is ""guitar repair"". But, overall its a good book with usefull information... A bit dated, but still relevant"
4,Completelym undisputed guide,"This guide is the most needed, useful, great helper and bible for the guitar repair and maintenance. I had already browsed it once or twice and been advised with some tips from people who had it or read it. It's the best guide of the genre with many ""old innovative"" techniques still applied currently, for technology can't do much about this subject.I'm loving it!!"
1,DVD - defective,"The actual content of the video is great but the DVD stopped in the middle and doesn't play. Since it was opened I'm out the $20 for the DVD. Since it was a present for a friend who is a huge fan of the Gunners, I was embarrassed."
3,Believability,"Read this book for believability - I was willing to suspend disbelief until the detective started blabbing EVERYTHING to the reporter. Most cops I know are VERY close-mouthed about everything, much less the details of a double murder. Also, I threw down a red penalty flag when the keys were CONVENIENTLY found in the woods off Piedmont Rd. - too much coincidence. After that, I started looking for details to pull apart...."
1,Very Stupid,"This is an unbelievable book. I can't believe that a detective would blab everything to a reporter. Although the author is african american, he paints a very small minded view of african american males. He makes his males always trying to get the big break from "" the man"". They all lust after white women, they respect their mothers and hate their fathers. I did not find that out to around the end of the book. You really don't know much about the main character at all."
4,"No McQuarrie, and yet an awesome art of Star Wars Book","I loved the art Ralph McQuarrie did for the first three Star Wars movies, and in the Art of Episode I, Doug Chiang takes the torch and does an awesome job. His grand scale works are so appealing and detailed, I loved it.The character concept work in intriguing, there is a lot of evolutionary type paintings which I like a lot. The Sith work is fascinating.The one draw back to the book was the lack of explaination each work had. I would have liked more insight as to what the artist was thinking, what Lucas liked and what he disliked. That wasn't in this version as much as I would have liked. But overall, one to own."
5,This give us preview of Episode II!!!,"Wow what a book! filled with surprises, unique arts. It knocked me out especially seeing several concept arts for epsidoe II. I'd better brace myself for upcoming episode II!!! These arts are beyond my expections!Good book, recommend!"
2,Good but not as good as other Star Wars Art of books,I must say that the paintings were fantastic and the conceptual drawings were excellent. The only problem was that I didn't see nearly the range of work from the film that I saw in the other Art of Star Wars books! Also the artwork in the book had been seen many times before on the official website and in the Episode 1 Insiders Guide CD-rom. In fact the CD-rom had more artwork on it!
2,Not good as the hype,"No one comes close to the artwork of Ralpf McQuarrie. The art in this book was good overall, but not worth all the hype it is recieving."
4,Passion Wins Over the Bottom Line,"Although the setting in the 1950s (my guess is 1951 since it matches that calendar), the passion for the good of the company, its employees, and legacy extends beyond just the financial ""bottom line"" of success. This book portrays that well. It's refreshing as well as a reminder that such approach can still hold true in corporations of the 21st century. Both the movie of the same name and the book are worth seeing and reading.If there was any downside in the book it's that the author dwells a bit too long on the past -- a background story on nearly all of the characters in the story. The climax of the story however is worth the wait. Going to work may not be the same anymore."
2,Its not for everyone,"As a female I figured it couldn't hurt to make sure the sex drive stays up there. Thought I'd give it a try. Personally, the reaction wasn't what I was looking for. Too hormonal (As if we ladies don't have enough of that to deal with). It was like a major emotional PMS moment. Oh well on to the next one to try and see if its any good. Can't hurt to try right? Give it a try as if you like as everyone's body chemistry is different but just know if your a chick this could be a result."
3,Bought this for the funny name,"I do think it made me a little bit more horny than usual, and that's a good thing. Not that I wasn't horny before. I think I'll order another bottle."
5,Grey wolves,"This the second in a series of three DVDs deals with the start of the Battle of the Atlantic and the ""Happy Times"" Lots of good footage taken on various Uboats at sea....good narration provides lots of good information.....enjoyed this very much."
3,Murder and the Corruption of the Media,"Joe Wilcox is a veteran crime reporter for the prestiguous Washington Tribune. However, Joe is middle-aged, suffering from the doldrums and having young aggressive reporters fresh from journalism school nipping at his heels. A beautiful young woman who works at the Trib is found strangled to death. This story could be just the thing to rejuvenate Joe's career. How Joe handles the story will cause Joe to examine his past, his ambitions and his ethics. Into the mix are Joe's daughter Roberta a star broadcast journalist and his mysterious brother Michael. The story holds one's interest but it isn't difficult to figure out the identity of the murderer fairly early on. What makes this mystery worth reading is it's insightful portrait of the ethical dilemmas faced by journalists in today's super fast paced media world."
2,Unhappily Ever After,"Why did the author have to write that last chapter? Up to that point, the story was at least adequate. Without giving away the ending, suffice it to say that no matter how unbelievably crappy the characters' lives turned out, Disney could not have conjured up a sappier ending. Good grief."
3,Murder at the Washington Tribune,"After waiting to read Margaret Trumans' 21st book in the Capital Murder series I was disapointed. Truman's insights to the behind the scene's goings on in Washington's major sites was the unique part of her mystery series. Even though she was speaking about a fictional newspaper she could have continued this view. She had a great chance to describe the way reports work with politicians. This mystery could have been set in any city. I hope her next book will be better, I'd hate to have this be her last."
2,Murder at Washington Tribune,I didn't think this book was nearly as good as her previous ones. I usually enjoy the books she has written but not this one.
2,Not Margaret Truman's Best,"I was really disappointed with this novel. After reading great ones such Murder in The White House, Murder in Havana and Murder in Library of Congress. This novel was so predictable and it wasn't suspenseful and the ending was a total disappointment. I won't even mention the storyline because halfway thru is a dead giveaway. Wait for the next one."
4,Rock's Review of Black Rush,"Black Rush is one of the best Horror books that I've read in a long time. I'm an avid fan of Stephen King, and Mr. Richardson has impressed me by his work immensely. I can't wait for his next book!"
1,Winch and Amazon Customer Service STINK.......,"The PullzAll never worked out of the box. Warn Works customer service says the product was probably defective and to return it to Amazon for replacement. I do and Amazon decides to give me a refund (minus a restocking fee of $35.62) and not the replacement that I specifically asked for. When I asked them about it, they simply say ""We would like to help BUT........ and you can reorder another online if you wish."" Fat chance of that. The time and expense of shipping a faulty piece of equipment back and forth isn't worth the hassle or the cost. Bottom line: Faulty product - Lousy customer service."
2,Electric Pulling Tool(Warn Model 685000,"The Warn Model 685000Pulzall 110 Corded Electric Power Tool is very limited in what it can do, due to the lack of a remote cord control or a longer cord. The motor sounds like a power drill is operating it, and the wire rope does not look like it will hold up for long.Because of where the trigger control is located, the operator will have to be right up to the work, and if something is lifted, be on a ladder over the work. It could get dangerous, depending upon what is lifted. This product needs to be re-designed, even if it costs more.A low cost chain hoist is better than this product. Jed A. Peeler"
4,Decent pulling tool,"I bought this to raise and set thirteen 202 lb flue liners. I was very happy with it's performance. It allowed me precision control setting the flue liners and never slipped (which could have meant a crushed arm or hand)Pros: Heavy cable resist twisting and fraying. Locks into position every time. Feather touch both forward and reverse(down to the millimeter). Decent construction. Hoisted loads up to 400 lbs flawlessly with precision control.Cons: Motor gets hot with frequent use (the instructions list a ridiculous cycle time (2 minutes run/30 minutes cool down @500lbs) I used it much more frequently and didn't burn it up but it did get hot). The cable is short (15') which really limits your use of it.Conclusion:With a better duty cycle and longer cable (50'), this would be a real winner. But I knew that before I bought it. So all and all it was a good tool. I would buy it again, even with it's limitations- it worked well for me."
2,IT WAS GOOD WHILE IT LASTED.,It was a great tool until the motor burned out after using it for about 6 times. The warranty had expired two weeks before it gave up. I used it for home construction and did not abuse it. A new motor will cost $100.00. Nice tool if you do not not need lift much with it and I may buy another one.
3,It's just okay.,"I bought these dice for my 18-month old daughter to teach her what dice is. It just does the work, and now she knows what dice is, but that's it. Needs some other plans to make her play with these."
4,Commuting made easy,"I had been using a backpack to carry my office clothes when commuting, but found the backpack to be uncomfortable. This trunk bag accomplishes what the backpack did, but with more comfort for me as well as a lower center of gravity for me and the bike. Despite its spaciousness, it doesn't quite accommodate my shoes (so I leave two pairs at the office), but it does hold a complete set of clothes otherwise. If I could change only one thing about it, I would make it about three inches longer so that my shoes would fit in the interior of the bag."
3,Hard to read in low light,"My husband was so excited to get this but wanted to add some contrast between the hands of the clock (white) and the background of the clock. I didn't want him to adjust anything so I just picked a different clock. Otherwise, love the clock, the service and the shipping and would highly recommend it if you are going to hang in a well-lit area."
1,horrible!,"I have purchased several Spanish CD programs. This by far is the worst. The dialog is boring and difficult to follow. Worst of all is the primary speaker. She is not a native Spanish speaker, and her gringo accent is bad enough that advanced students will have trouble understanding her. This product certainly does not live up to its fancy marketing. Everything I have purchased from Living Language is way better."
3,"Nice, but doesn't minimize that well","I actually have the Soprane minimizer, which is the earlier version of this bra (essentially the same bra, just the center front is a different material). I do like the look of this bra; it has a smooth, pretty look for a minimizer, though I don't think it actually works that well. It does minimize a bit, though partially because of how the bra distributes one, there isn't much of a difference, though I`m not sure how well it would work for larger sizes (I`m 36D). (Note that the bra is French sized, so the bra band is a lot shorter and the cups are larger/fuller than with average American bras.)"
1,Awful!,"Especially for the price, this bra is just terrible. The descriptions reads ""Molded underwire cups"". Not only are the cups not molded, on the one I got, they are not padded or even lined. The construction is bad & the material is cheap. I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better. Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just can't give it more than one star. I have heard this brand is good, but this particular one is not & is going back. Don't waste your money."
3,Fair purchase,"This product wears well but just after one week the side supports worn through. So I had to sew it so I would not be poked all day. I would think for the price the quality would be better,"
5,"Yes, it's big, but so far so good as carry-on","Love this bag. And I'm 3 for 3 in getting it in the overhead bin. It's very tight though, so I don't expect my streak to last forever."
3,"HB-207, just to large for normal use","This backpack is great. It secures everything you'll put in perfectly. It is convenient it is comfortable, etc. The only thing I somehow missed it is so BIG, LARGE, HUGE!!!!!It is like carrying truck on your back.It is really perfect... I guess for a profi holding several bodies and lenses and tripod and flash and laptop and... and.... and...And it seems to be just to large for us normal humans............"
5,Wow,"This bag is huge! probably too big for what I wanted it for, but I will never need to upgrade to a larger bag. It is well built and has room for everything! It came with a cool bonus strap for my dSLR which can be attached to the bag when you're wearing it. It is an awesome pack, I'm glad I bought it, hopefully I can get it on the plane as carry-on. Going home to put all my camera stuff in it to see what it is capable of."
1,"Celtic Gods and, er, ah, other Gods and Heros","The art is pretty and the section on Celtic Gods is fairly good for those it covers. However Mr. Stewart seems unable to see Goddesses as deities in their own right. He relegates Celtic Goddesses to the role of appendage to various Gods and (male) heros including none Celtic ones. There are many good books, read this one only is you have time to waste in the dentist's office."
5,Excellent Overview of the Celtic Pantheon,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I appreciate how the gods and goddesses are presented within the context of Celtic mythology and culture, and even of specific locations and the land itself. This is not a fanciful description of all the attributes of various deities. It is an attempt to understand the complex relationship between these deities and the people and lands of the Celtic world. The book is full of fascinating research and well considered speculations by an author who has devoted many years of his life to understanding Celtic myth and magic. I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about understanding the Celtic way of life and the Celtic relationship with magic."
5,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book and a worthy addition to any collection of Celtic studies. It offers some unique insights that I haven't found anywhere else. Highly recommended.
4,"EASY TO UNDERSTAND, BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS!",A GOOD BOOK FOR PEOPLE JUST LEARNING THE CELTIC MYTHOLOGIES AND PANTHEON. VERY GOOD FOR SOME ONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN ALL THINGS CELTIC! A NEW PAGAN MUST.
2,Reads like a boring textbook,"If in reference for gods and goddesses, this is not the most informative book. I would have given it 1 star, but there were some decent illustrations, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars. It really reads like a very boring textbook, and doesn't go into too many gods and goddesses. It gives a lot of history about the ideas in celtic dieties, but not too much into specific gods and goddesses. Read at your own risk."
1,bad game,All you do in this game is collect 100 things about 5 times. it has bad cutsenes and it has bad camra views. p.s. it only looks cool on tv
4,Tak....one fun game...boom baby!,"I find this game very enjoyable to play. Ever since I bought the gamecube, I wanted a game that I could compare to Banjo Kazoie, this is that game. Tak is funny to watch when he reacts to his environments and the short movies are a blast to watch. I haven't laughed so much ever playing a video game.I think the story is unique which makes the game more fun to play, and the characters are fun to watch.Overall I think this game is one of the classics, one that should not be passed over.I'll let you know what I think of Tak 2 and 3 when I play those next."
1,where is the zero star on this 5-10,if u got it for christmas or for your B- day then thats all right. But if u bought this your self then u got a huge problem. If u want to buy this load of crap stop well your ahead. The story line is half ass. The guy is so stupid he proably needs to figure out what his name is and it takes way to much memory for a bad game. If u want a good game look at resident evil 4 or grand theft auto.
1,Awful!,"This game stinks! Why? Because Tak never dies, the plot is for those who can't understand other simple games, and the corny humor with bad graphics and too much hype. Oh, great, Nickolodeon decidesto release an ""originol"" game, and the result? This load of crud. Trust me, if you want a GOOD game of this type, try a console Spongebob game. If you STILL wanna play it, you are very wierd."
4,the stupidest game,"this game is possibly the most stupid i've ever seen! the graphics are the only half decent part the story line is ""BLAH!"" and the plot weapons and advertising were stupid too. parants I'm warning you. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Tak is a loser tothed kid. the enemys don't show a challenge and the way they advertised was dumb! they didin't show screenshots or game clips! its all just talk don't buy it!!!"
4,dont buy it,"this game juju stuff is really bad, the guy doesnt know how to do anything he probably doesnt know his name????its a waste of money and has no action like nfsu or thug or,i could go on with games better than this.spent all your money on something more cooler than this tak whatever the games name is stuff."
5,Pink Fada's Tak review,"This game is not only fun but absolutely beautiful! Best platforms on any game ever! The jungle, the animals, the snowboarding, the sandboarding and the chicken suite make this game just non-stop fun! And Tak is one funny Pupanunu! Everyone should buy this game!"
1,Barf,I wish I could say this movie sucks but it is nowhere close to being that good. I could not even finish watching this pile of dog poop. Someone pick it up with the pooper scooper and put it in the thrash.
2,Don't like it,"Overall, a pretty silly--not funny--movie. Even with great actors such as Meg Ryan and William Macy trying to pull it out of the doldrums, it doesn't work."
2,Funny Only if You've Never Seen a Movie Before,"Pointless, dumb and self-indulgent is my synopsis to something that neither is a story nor contains a plot but does contain a hodgepodge of poorly, reworked comedic scenes found in countless films over the past 80 years. The film goes something like this: desperate people meet; try to sort things out through one dumb error after another (supposedly the funny parts); finally it all works out and they live happily ever after. There's suppose to be a quirky insider look at the movie making industry but, alas, nothing anyone born after 1930 doesn't already know. Add run-of-the-mill acting and fragmented directing/editing to make for a boring and tortuous viewing experience. Even the reviewers that gave it 5 stars (do they work for the studio?) consistently had little to say about the movie."
5,Deal or no Deal? Definitely Deal.,"I'm a huge William H. Macy fan. From Fargo to A Civil Action, from his days with Mamet to most recently, he is such a great character actor, so I went into this movie with high hopes. I was not disappointed. He plays a hilariously sarcastic screenwriter who dupes Hollywood while falling for Meg Ryan. LL Cool J steals the show as a rapper/method actor. I just wish he was in the movie longer. I recommend it for anyone who loves cinema satire."
2,A movie with very limited appeal,"Hollywood apparently has an abiding incestuous interest in its own shallowness, since several movies have been made about the phony baloneys who make too many of the movies. There are, of course, movies that are truly works of art, but they are not all that numerous. ""The Deal"" is not anywere near the top of the line.The story is a mess. William Macy's character is in the process of killing himself as the movie opens. He is living in squalor and is obviously not successful. But he is interrupted by a nephew with a movie script, which Macy doesn't read but decides must be rewritten--several times. Then his hype begins and soon a movie is being made without much of a script. Disaster follows disaster until it is all one great mess, which I assume is supposed to be amusing.There's a good cast of Macy, Meg Ryan, Elliot Gould, et al., but even a good cast can't make this amusing to anyone except Hollywood insiders. It's almost sure to be a yawn for everyone else."
1,Terrible,"This is the worst Meg Ryan movie EVER !! Thought she could have made better choices. Really lame. Lot of profanity, ever other word.Don't know why it is rated so high. Will think twice about watching Meg again. Don't wasted your time and money. Would have given this a negative number but not a choice"
4,the deal,i will watch it again but its not your typical meg ryan movie. it was cute but i was a little disapointed.
5,Perfect Grill cover,we love our new grill cover! its very well made and looks great. its soft and supple and nice and thick so it should last a long time.my husband has it placed so all the traffic going by can see the nice big PENN STATE emblem.we haven't had it long enough to say how well the color holds up under the sun but time will tell.our previous one was a rather expensive beige nylon type (purchased at Lowes) and it fell completely apart in less than 2 years from exposure to the sun. how could someone make a product designed to be outside 24/7 that can't take the sun is beyond me!!this PENN STATE grill cover was a good buy!
5,Great quality for a great price!!,Recently bought this for a fathers day gift for my husband. Felt like great quality for a great price so hopefully it holds up :)
5,Inner City Mass Choir:Heaven,"The album heaven is a very beautiful and joyous album.When you want to just sit and relax this is the cd for you or may even read a book.The inner city mass choir sings their hearts and praises.I give it five stars.if i could i would give it infinity.Now from my opinoin God of mercy(rain on us) the best. If you don't believe me then listen to a sample of it. Thank-You, Daniel Cameron"
4,Great CD,"I think this CD is so awesome. It was definitely a plus that they had John P Kee as a writer for the project. The CD really sets the atmosphere for praise and worship and will ""take you to church"" if you let it. My favorite song is ""Where the spirit of the Lord is"" a definite must- have."
2,God of Mercy,I really liked that song. I wish there was a way I could listen to the whole song on the internet without having to just hear a sample.
5,Warm and cozy.,I love this sweater it is warm and cozy and still looks a bit military. Order 1 size larger than you think you need.
4,Monsters Rule!,"Monster Rancher 4 is a great playstation2 game,when I rented one day from blockbuster,I thought ""This game doesn't look that great and all"",then when I played,It was like one of the best games ever!Creating monsters with game discs,Cds,and DVDs is a great feature,the battling style in this game is quite different,what attacks you use depends on distnce,and energy.The monsters in this game are really well done,I like how the monsters look when they are part breed.Ape Escape fans will like this too because it has 3 monkeys wich are from Ape Escape.What I like about this is that the Monsters do not die,they just get tto old that they can't stay at the ranch anymore.I love this game and I can't wait to get the 5th one!Oh yeah,by the way,I am actually 13.I'm not a kid."
4,Great game,The condition was great and came with everything it said it would. Though it said that it was in good condition but it came like it was new no marks or any thing on the disk or the cover. The time it took to get it was sorta long it migh of came in a bout 9to10 days. but overall worth the wait
5,DO NOT ORDER FROM GAMEAVE,"They do not have the product in stock. They will not tell you this. They are just trying to get your credit card number so you have to get the game from them, even though they will not tell you when they will have it. Check their reviews, they do this all the time. Wait and purchase the game from a trusted source.GAMEEAVE PRACTICES FALSE ADVERTISEMENT - DO NOT SUPPORT THEM"
4,BEST MONSTER RANCHER GAME EVER!!!!,Monster Rancher deserves 5stars for it's multi breeding option so MR(monster rancher}can grow and becom better and better so for all of you who love MR you should buy Monster Rancher not1 not2 or even3 I'm talken4.
1,"Not sure about produce, company complaint","I'm not able to leave this seller feedback, so doing so here. My order was cancelled with no explanation. It's showing that the item is in stock, so I don't understand."
3,"Handy, But Hard To Attach The Solstice","The knife is about the perfect size to carry. Opening the knife is easy but disengaging the lock, (which is also part of the handle) is a little tougher than most. The Solstice is a great idea but very difficult to attach to a key ring. You have to squeeze the scissors together with one hand and turn the handles up with the other. Sounds easy enough, but the key ring tends to fall out of the hole/gaps during the process. Also the Solstice I got is pretty tight and the handles don't move as easily as I expected. Description says made in U.S.A. but package says made in China. I bought mine at a Target store vs from website don't know if that matters where they're made. I like my Leatherman Squirt(w/ scissors) a lot better than the Solstice and they are about the same size. Price is still good for quality Gerber products. I just wish it was made in U.S.A."
5,Great Oldie But Great!,Bought 3 videos for my elderly mother and she loves them. Can't get the classics without being edited on television; she's very happy with her new movies :-)!
4,Still best example of pressures of hunter and hunted.,"This is still best story of hunter and hunted. (Later, more technologically advanced films principally focus on the sub. e.g. Das Boot, Red October and Crimson Tide.) Good guys/Bad guys-Americans/Germans nearly irrelevant to taut story line. Wendall Mays did a much better job on this screenplay than on other Mitchum-Powell collaboration, The Hunters. People who watch too much t.v. will recognize this as the basis for the Star Trek where they first met the Romulans. My copy is in color."
5,One of the Best!,"This suspenseful World War II movie, one of the best naval war films made, follows an American submarine in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens are wonderful.--Diana Dell, author, ""A Saigon Party: And Other Vietnam War Short Stories."""
3,ok,For some reason word don't match the mouth. I've seen better sub movies. Arrived very fast. That's all folks. See ya
5,Excellent battle of wits.,"This movie is an excellent example between two seasoned professionals - no good guy vs bad guy, revenge motives, no sex, no swearing; an example of a quality movie that Hollywood can do when it puts its mind to it. Excellent performance by an all-star, legendary cast! A war movie that anyone would enjoy that wants more from a movie than simple gore and violence; a thinking man's kind of movie. A must have if you are a fan of the ""destroyer vs submarine"" type of naval warfare."
5,Unique kind of war movie,"I like this movie for several reasons.1. The Germans are not demonized.2. It is suspenseful, especially because it makes you, as a viewer, want neither ship to destroy the other. You come to like both the American commander and the German commander, especially as it becomes clear that they hate war.3. The two commanders respect each other. Their enemy is more the war than each other!I guess it has a hopefulness which is not in most war movies, showing how crises sometimes cause enemies to work together. I like it most of all because it's unique, for not making either side the good guy or bad guy."
4,The Enemy Below,"A classic WWII movie for its time. The film, although a just a movie, is technocally correct in some areas. WWII movie lovers should like this one."
4,The Enemy Below,"I enjoy submarine movies, the movie keeps you involved.The movie has a good storey line, great actors.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old classic movies."
5,"Enemies, but also more.","Outstanding film, moving beyond stereotypes to substantive portrayals of combatants doing their best, not for ideology but for the men around them and for the sake of survival. On both sides, combatants rise above their antagonisms to respect those on the other side. One of the most hope=-filled films of the era."
4,Cat and mouse games on the high seas in WWII,Thoroughly enjoyed the cat and mouse games between the sub and battle cruiser - highly recommend for WWII buffs.
4,Very good story....++++,...saw it years ago when i was a kid...and still i enjoyed seeing it again...great story line....Recommend to any war movie buff....
4,personnel use,"I am interested in WW2 movies. I found the movie entertaining. For the price, the movie was good. I do not regret buying it."
5,Well Done,"If historical mystery is part of your reading diet, then you cannot go wrong with Mr. Marston. If you read one, you will want to read all. The books show much referance done and well told stories..."
5,Fun for all ages,"Whether in the car, at a restaurant waiting for food or just at home, this game is perplexing and fun. For all ages. Magnetic parts keep them from getting lost. A must have!"
2,What was the cameraman thining?!!!,"Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to think that Ozric Tentacles is a band that might appeal to musicians, especially keyboard players!Well, obviously the videographer doesn't get that. Throughout the video he seems most interested in focusing on the clowning antics of the woodwind player, who spends a great deal of time dancing around and making faces, while the keyboard player and guitarist are making the majority of the music being heard.The music is good. I had hoped to watch the musicians creating it.There is a lot of footage of the drummer from under his snare drum. To be fair, there is plenty of guitar footage, but isn't this band dominated by keyboards? The videographer seems to go out of his way NOT TO SHOW any KEYBOARDS being played.I found the video frustrating to watch for that reason."
1,What? I can't hear you!,"If you are hearing impaired, this is the DVD for you. It must have been mixed by Helen Keller. Let's not fault the band one percent on this, they are simply incredible. And that's what I expected this DVD to reflect. I was going to spotlight this band at a music video conference, and the audio on this DVD is leaving me now with looking for a different band. It's too bad the band has no vocalist, because you might have at least gotten subtitles. Don't buy this thing. Please.But DO buy ALL of their (Ozric Tentacles) albums. The band is simply INCREDIBLE, did you hear that?"
5,This isn't flower power Hippi,"Yeah, As others mentioned. This was produced in England and the format is wrong for the US..But , If you live in an Indian Neighborhood as I do, for a small fee they will copy a conversion to US standards or, you can buy a ilo DVR recorder..Anyways, Forget the camera work..For some reason this album is no longer available as a cd and I had to have this album because I do have the cd at my house in Vietnam but, absolutely need to hear this concert while I am in the US. Too bad the crowd gave flowers to them in the end. They rock in a very hypnotic way..The musicians are very tight in the rhythm and playing..It is such an awesome sounding compilation and they are very dedicated to a great sound..I love this album the most ..If you can ever get it back on cd- Crank it up to 11."
2,Our school is very unfortunate to select this book,"Our school district in Walnut, CA for some God known reason selected this book.In addition to many small errors the book has got across every chapter, it only gives answers and no solutions to odd problems.It would've been OK if the material was well explained before the problems, but this is not a case. The book explains a simplest possible concept(s), but then gives the problems to solve two levels above the concept explained and does not provide a solution or even an answer.Our high school Math teacher teaching Honors classes is often stuck herself understanding some of the concepts.I recommend to change the book and modify the American educational system."
1,Wrong Book,"When I searched for the Algebra 2 book, it showed the correct book (front cover has the St. Louis arch on it). I selected it, but when delivered, it was a different Algebra book. When I noticed the difference, I went back and retraced my steps, and sure enough, it is the wrong version of Algebra 2. You should be more careful how your system works. I sent the book back & hope I will not be charged shipping fees (as your website says).Glencoe Algebra 2, Student Edition (Glencoe)"
4,hard to see,the game itself does follow the show. the grapichs are exellent. BUT....when playing the game your walking on float land...and we you walk you cant see where your going since the camera is at an odd angle.... my kids have a hard time playing this one....We like TAK or TY Tiger better!!!
1,This game is a major waste,"The graffics are pretty bad even considering that it's a cartoon the voices for cosmo and wanda sound like they are talking through a pillow, you can barely hear let alone understand them and game play is extreamly repatative.I rented this from gamefly.com and I am so glad I did not shell out 40 dollars for this game."
3,"It's an ""ok"" mat","This is not the best mat, but it does the job.I have no idea why the other mats are expensive! It's just rubber!!!Anyway, this one is good for Abs and BodyPump training because of the thickness, but for Yoga you might want to consider a thinner mat."
2,This is not the right mat for yoga,"I bought this mat when I just started doing yoga. It took me some time to realize that it's not the right mat for yoga, so I bought another one1) it's too thick for yoga2) when you do for example downfacing dog, the mat also stretches, and it doesn't feel comfortable for the poses like this.2) it's thick and it's not very comfortable for your hands.The quality of the mat is good, but I don't think it's the right mat for yoga."
4,great mat. comfortable. soft and easy to maintain,"great mat. comfortable. soft and easy to maintain. all pluses in my book. oh.. and very affordable. It's not like the mats you find in the gym (or the ones from your gymnasium at school), but good for home use to do a few crunches/situps."
3,What Happened to the Neanderthals,"I thought that the topic and content were very stimulating. The use of cheesy Dark skinned Neanderthal Robots was a detraction, especially since Neanderthals were probably blond light skinned like the Norsemen since they lived in the tundra."
5,Great book,"I was and still am client/caller of Anna's. The difference between her and other dozens psychic online are that she can be trusted. This book reveals in depth world of phone pyschic. As regards to Anna, she has not taken money if/when she is unable to read for a person. How many phone psychic have done that? NONE. Anna has never given me false hope nor misled me. Her predictions takes time to manifest. Some of them took almost a year! It is true no psychic is 100% accurate, however Anna has proven herself time and time again. This is a wonderful book to read and eye opening and great discussion of this eperdemic. Good job Anna, for revealing the truth."
4,A thorough account of the exploration of Antarctica.,"This small book covers every successful and some unsuccessful attempts to conquer the southern continent. It covers the entire period, from captain Cooks first sightings of ice around Antarctica through to the present where Antarcticas frigid landscape is dotted with international stations. This is a thorough investigation of the worlds attempts to conquer a barren frigid continent, from attaining the `grail' of the South Pole to charting the landscape of Mt. Erebus. A good account and an excellent overview.Separate sections detail exploration of the various seas(Weddel and Ross) as well as the continents wildlife and resources."
4,Context of antarctic exploration,"Landis does a wonderful job of providing a grand historical context for the impact of Antarctica on human thought and exploration. She begins in ancient Greece and follows the development of the ""world views"" of succeeding civilizations, until the birth of the idea of Antarctica.Into this context she places the intrepid men who sailed out and sought this legendary land since the 1500s. Most interesting is her depiction of the great explorers for the rogues gallery they were, as opposed to the sanitized versions from history books. Many were in league with the monarchy of their country seizing plunder from their enemies and seeking to extend the influence of the monarchs they served.The entire book is worth buying for the beautifully crafted first part which delivers a historical, philosophical and at the same time very personal context for understanding the role Antarctica has played through the ages."
5,A God Calling Fan,"I've had God Calling on my morning devotion list since 1990 or before, in fact it started me off with morning devotions. I read it every year and now I get to leave the heavier book and home and take it with me in this form. Great blessing."
2,Not Pratchett's Best Work,"Unfortunately, this book is really not a good representative of Terry Pratchett's genius. Here he takes on the subject of opera, but he clearly doesn't know much about it. His two main themes are ""opera plot lines are bizarre and hard to understand"" and ""the show must go on."" There are only so many jokes you can make on these two ideas, and he makes them all - twice.The character of Perdita X. Dream/Agnes Knitt is really fantastic, but I do not think this book does her justice. Though she is the central figure, she doesn't get to spend the time in the spotlight that her fans yearn to see.If you're interested in Terry Pratchett, pick another book. I recommend ""Night Watch,"" ""Thud!"" ""Monstrous Regiment,"" ""The Truth,"" or, really, just about any of his other work."
3,"I want to actually give it 3 and a half, OK?","The first time I read this I confess I wasn't that gripped. Agnes seemed flat, the plot seemed difficult and the jokes forced. BUT the second time I read it it had for some reason improved. The descriptions of the theatre are eerie and ring very true, the jokes seemed more natural - although I still don't get the plot properly and Agnes still seems a rather forced character. Also, I think I missed out on a lot of the humour because I haven't seen Phantom Of The Opera. Worth a read, but not the best Pratchett book."
3,"Good, but not the greatest","Overall the book was interesting. I particulary liked the Mouse Death that reincarnated the rat catcher as a rat. While the real Death gets a lot more appearances then his Rat alterego still though the book had its moments that it seemed to be missing something overall. Maybe it was the setting of the book... Then again it could be contributed to many things. Overall good, but still good is less then great, and great is less then classic."
4,Very enjoyable,"Again, if you're a fan of the Discworld you have to read this one, too. I had it sitting on the shelf for a while and just got around to reading it. I really enjoy Phantom of the Opera and thoroughly enjoyed the connection. I always like to catch up on the lives of the witches and to check out what Death is up to. Keep up the good work."
2,"None too good, I'm afraid...","I'm a bit dubious about all the rave reviews for this book. Yes, I'm as fanatical about Pratchett as anybody, but this is simply not one of his better works. I've never liked Discworld ""mysteries,"" and this is worse than most. The plot simply isn't very compelling, and Granny Weatherwax is even more obnoxious than usual. Basically, if you're a hardcore Pratchefile, you've already read it, and if you're not, you really don't need to bother."
3,Phantom of the Opera,This is definitely not Pratchett's best effort. Again I love Granny Weatherwax but can't seem to find any of the books that she is in that really excite me or that I can give higher ratings too. They won't let Agnes be on center stage because of her weight? Huh? Opera is the one place women aren't discriminated against so much because of their weight. The story just gets bogged down too much.
2,"My least favorite Pratchett Book, but...","It's probably my fault. I don't know, I've loved every other Discworld book, but I don't particularly like Maskerade. I suspect that if I were a fan of opera and the theater in general, and Phantom of the Opera in particular, I'd've split my sides with this book. Unfortunately, I'm not and I didn't."
2,ALL so-so,"Sergei Rachmaninov once wrote words to the following effect: ""When I wrote my first symphony, the critics all said it was so-so. When I wrote my seconds the critics said that my first was good, but my second was so-so. When I wrote my third, the critics said that my first two were good, but that this one was so-so.""All of Rachmaninov's symphonies are, in fact, so-so. The critics' instincts were right while their memories were wrong. I now know my instincts about Pratchett's books are right, while my memory is not to be trusted at all. They're ALL relentlessly middlebrow. How the illusion that I was perpetually unlucky with the one I happened to be reading at the moment was maintained, I have no idea. But I finally woke up with ""Maskerade""."
2,The Story's not as catchy as its cover...,"There's Witches, Death, Greebo, and the wizards of the Unseen University. It's a slapstick off of The Phantom of the Opera that mostly everybody should understand and appreciate. But for some reason, it just didn't happen for me. I found the plots seemed to drag on for too long, cameos by Death, Greebo and the Witches too short, and the new faces Maskerade introduced far too one-dimensional and dry. This novel should have worked, but it didn't."
4,Among the Best of Discworld,"This Discworld novel plays off Phantom of the Opera. Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg set off to Ankh-Morpork to find out why they have not received royalties due Nanny for her best-selling cookbook of naughty erotic and aphrodisiac delicacies, and to check up on Agnes Nitt, who has gone to seek her fortune and is singing in the background for a young airheaded opera starlet who looks good in a sequined costume, in a sort of Milli-Vanilli scenario. She has not yet joined the coven, but has found she doesn't seem to fit in anywhere else; her alter-ego, Perdita, is also not yet developed into the alternate personality it becomes in later books. This one is quite funny, and the plot moves along well. There's a pseudo-Italian imposter tenor, Greebo makes an hilarious appearance in human form, and we get to experience a lot of Granny, my favorite witch character. It loses a star only because it dissipates some of its energy on one too many minor characters and subplots."
2,Nice book shame about the binding.,"I have long been a fan of Terry Pratchett so was thrilled to recieve this book for Christmas, paperback format of course. I was horrified when the book split into pieces on me. Harper Collins Publishers did a lousey job of binding it.Recession or not the glue has to actually hit the paper to make it stick together.What a shame that a marvellous read has been ruined by incompetent publishers."
3,Not the best in the series...,"Maskerade is an entertaining read - it features the witches in Ankh-Morpork attending an opera - but it is not his best work. That's why I wait for them in paperback, though. Definitely worth getting for a real discworld fan; if you're just getting into the series pick up some of the others first - ""Wyrd Sisters"" and ""Lords and Ladies"" would help you understand a lot of the references. Death has a cameo, as he does in almost all of them, but it's a reasonably important one. Read it, you'll like it. Borrow it from a friend if you can."
2,Could have been better...,"This is the first time I've ever read a book by Terry Pratchett, although I read and liked his ""novelette"" in Legends. Maskerade was refered to as a spoof on phantom of the opera, which I've adored for as long as I can remember. But the book had way too much about Granny Weathrwax and Nanny Ogg, with not nearly enough Phantom-like elements to it. It's put me off from reading anything else by him. A dissapointment, overall."
2,Cutesy. Too too cutesy.,"I put Pratchett on a ""NO READ"" list after finishing MASKERADE (Discworld Novel).I was not pleased. It was so deliberate and forcedly clever/cute/noxious. The entire cliche, double entendre, faux pas style of writing wears thin very quickly.I would consider Robert Lynn Asprin's MYTH Series much better choices. Or Piers Anthony's XANTH-ian run of books.That said, I may pick up one of titles recommended by other readers. I have seen how some authors have a good thing and lose it along the way. I am still fixated by early Andre Norton (especially her Forerunner stories), but later stuff dips low in its crafting.Nuff said."
4,Good stands,"Good stands. Were delivred on time. The bag is a great accessory. Wish the cables were a little longer but besides that, a good product."
3,Works but....,I thought it came with a package deal with my Behringer EUROPORT EPA150 Ultra-Compact 150-Watt 5-Channel Portable PA System that I bought. The top of the stands did not fit my speaker holes. Looking for the step down adapters as I type. But once I find them I should have no issues.
2,bad balance,"Well the stands came really fast,..put the speakers on them,..dont have confetence on the stands,....very shaky need more support,..i will not recomend or buy this product anymore,...might return this product thinking hard.Pyle PMDK102 Pro Audio Speaker Stand and Cable Kit"
3,"Stands okay, cables so-so","The stands seem to work fine, but the cables are a bit fragile. All of the connectors were loose upon arrival, and the solder inside is just a little dab on the wire with no mechanical connection. The supplied cables do not fit the amp I bought. Same brand (Pyle) amp.) I really expected Speakon connectors here. It was necessary to modify one end of each cable to work with the amplifier. That gave me two extra 1/4 inch plugs which was nice as one of the others failed after the first use. Not a huge problem unless you are expecting plug-and-play. I'll still give it three stars, because the stands and gear bag seem fine."
5,Exceptional value,"The deal looked good.. but I was also concerned that perhaps the product would be cheaply built to look like better products. I am very happy to report that was not the case. The product is of exceptional quality. The stands are extremely sturdy but lightweight, attractive, contain the safety locking pin (a must have feature). The stands alone were worth the price, throw in a very nice nylon gig bag that is also of exceptional quality and then you have a real steal. The bag alone goes for around 45-60 on amazon for similar product and it makes transporting these a breeze .. no more smashed fingers. Add to that the two cables and the deal is just unbelievable."
5,Great Buy!!,This is an awesome buy!! The speaker stands alone are worth the price as most are $40-$60 each at most places. And the free shipping was really fast!!
3,decent but not good,the bottom adjuster/tightener stripped after the second use. So now they suck. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN THE LOWER TENSIONER. IT WILL FAIL.
2,Good but not the best,"The stands work, but are very flimsy and not sturdy. The paint on the pipes are also easily scratchable. The bag is also very cheap, and its hard to get the stands in and out of the bag. I would spend a little more money on the nicer bag and sturdier stands. for what you pay its worth it though"
3,GETS THE JOB DONE,"Nice kit of speaker stands, cables and bag. However, the stands seem a little to small diameter wise for my 15"" PYL PRO 1569s. My speakers tend to wobble on the stands if touched. Hmmm, It gets the job done."
1,Same book different name,This is the same stuff Robert has told you in his other books. If you have any of them don't bother.
4,"Savage, prophetic satire on economic imperialism","A group of Germans want to turn a small Italian village into a tourist haven for birdwatchers. This would require the natives to give up their habit of hunting and eating songbirds. Meanwhile the the natives--who were former partisans during World War II--recognize some of the Germans as their old Nazi oppressors. Bjorneboe makes surrealistic use of this situation to examine the dynamics of economic globalization in a way which hits even harder today than when the play first appeared in 1966. <I>The Bird Lovers</I> is that rara avis, a musical with a totally original plot. It is to be regretted that the translator did not attempt metrical translations of the songs, leaving us without a stageable version of a play which richly deserves to be known in the English-speaking world."
3,4-piece Henckels,"These are a very good deal for the price ..a Henckels knife for less than $5. However. I was disappointed because they are not comparable to my 15 year-old Henckels. These are stamped steel knives and not the high quality forged Henckels knife you expect. However, they are excellent quality and when I check the Henckels site, the cheapest price for 4 steak knives was $100."
4,Nice Knives,Not bottom of the barrel and not top of the heap. Somewhere in the middle of the steak knives universe...
2,"One or Two Songs Make the Purchase ""Worth It""!","I got the CD because I heard the wonderful rendition of ""Perfect Praise"" over the radio. The words are God-glorifying and the gifted soloist leaves me breathless each time I hear what God has so generously given her and what she, in turn, gives back. I also appreciate the song, ""Use Me"" because of the words. The lead singer on this song, too, is abundantly gifted and that gift is being rightly used - to uplift the Name of Jesus. Some of the other arrangements are monotonous in their repetitious phrasing. I sometimes think we do more ""entertaining"" than praising through the medium of music."
4,Beautiful designs,"This book has over 400 gorgeous animal designs, most at a size perfect for small projects such as cards and coasters. It has plenty of alphabets so you can choose several of your favourites to put together a sampler too.The designs are excellent, many very realistic, with representations of most of the most popular dog and cat breeds. There are also a few cute cartoony ones that would be excellent for kids.My only argument with this book was the lack of photos of the completed designs - only the charts were available for most of them. There was a lack of half stitches, too, so more experienced stitchers might like to add theirs in to make a tidier design. Overall though, a great buy and one I would recommend to all cross-stitching animal lovers!"
5,Picture Your Pet in Cross Stitch,I absolutely love this book! It has a vas array of very cute patterns with multiple choices to choose from. I really appreciate the multiple color options as well. I've only found two faults. One is the pattern includes just shades of color on some of the stitches which is hard to see when you have low light & two the book doesn't show finished pictures of all of the projects just a few.
4,Good,"I liked the book. It has accurate drawings of the animals, I just with that it had a table of contents with pictures of the finished project."
4,Profound between the lines,"From the title it is obvious that the book is about Jesus [the] Christ rather than the so-called ""historical Jesus"" (if there is such a thing) although half a chapter is indeed devoted to this topic. It is a collection of essays, not necessarily connected at first sight, on how both Christians and non-Christians see and interpret Jesus and his teachings; it therefore also is a set of meditations and musings on how Christians practise their beliefs ""through the centuries"".Topics covered include the inter-relations between Christianity and: Judaism, Greek philosophy, politics, asceticism, art, mysticism, Renaissance, war, secularism, social justice, and colonialism - and many more.The style can be slightly academic but the prose as a whole is elegant and pleasing to read. Truly a classic."
4,"Jesus Through 2,000 Years","Pelikan's book looks at how Jesus has been viewed over the last 2,000 years, beginning with Jesus the Rabbi during his lifetime in Galilee and Judea. The author chooses to devote each chapter to an aspect of Jesus' place within the culture of a specific period, so the discussion can be somewhat restrictive - for example, the overview of ""just war"" theory within Christianity is conducted only in the context of the medieval and Reformation eras and ignores the many later theological developments. It is, however, a rich and enjoyable work, tracing the evolution of how Jesus has been seen from Jewish rabbi to deity to liberator."
3,"Inisghtful, But a Hard Read","This book was interesting and informational, but the prose is dry and academic. I'm a regular non-fiction reader, including the fruits of academia. I couldn't get into this. I've been able to read only half."
4,taking a fresh look,"The Devil's Disciples is well-researched study presented in a pleasant, readable style. One of the problems with many of the Salem witch trial books is that the authors try to ascribe the entire phenomenon to only a single cause. Hoffer successfully examines various possibilities and integrates them, showing how a multitude of factors conspired to generate and sustain the hysteria. The information he provides regarding the personalities and experiences of key individuals is particularly interesting. His assessment of frontier conditions at the time helps the reader take the perspective and mind-set of the town. Well worth reading, especially if some of the older, better-known resources, such as John Demos' Entertaining Satan, are familiar."
2,Basically interesting but chock full of irrelevancy,"The Salem Witch trials, possibly one of the most analyzed and anomolous events in American history, are documented with basic accuracy in Hoffer's book. However, in an attempt to say something new about such an overdone subject, Hoffer fills his book with references to supposed neo-witch trials (the satanic craze surrounding heavy metal in the 1980's), makes references to popular culture, and even pulls in the godawful, ridiculous wheat ergot theory. In addition, the cover is absolutlely eye-hurting horrid. If you are forced to write a paper on this book, as I was, and must look at it for several weeks, I would sugggest a very good pair of sunglasses."
3,Cute little cheesecakes!,"I loved the end product that this mini cheesecake pan produced but to get to the end product I found extremely difficult. After working so hard to make my mini cheese cakes for a holiday party, getting the cheese cakes out f the pan proved to be quite difficult. (I even went so far as to look online for hints on how to get the little cakes out) I finally got them out but only about half looked good enough to put on my party buffet table. Perhaps the key to his is practice...?"
4,highly recommend,"i started using chicago metallic products years ago after reading good things about them from professional chefs and i have not been disappointed yet. i recently made over 200 mini cheesecakes using two of these pans for a family member's wedding (over the course of a month or so!) and the pans baked each of the cakes evenly, the results were consistent, and the cheesecakes were a hit! the trickiest part is pulling the cheesecakes out of the pans without damaging the top or crust but with patience and practice (and it helps to run a knife around the edge of each of the cheesecakes right after you pull them out of the oven, just the way you would with a larger/solitary cheesecake) it's not a problem at all. i'm keeping both of the pans and will happily use them and recommend them to others for years to come!"
3,Count the disks right away,"As soon as the item arrives, before you throw away any packing material (including any paperwork) count the disks. I didn't use mine right away and when I did I found, in a factory sealed pack, I was two disks short. Not a big deal, but Amazon wanted me to ship the whole thing back for 2 disks. MAJOR annoyance and inconvenience. Seems it would have been cheaper, more expedient and much more consumer friendly to ship the two disks. Otherwise, order extras when you make your original purchase."
1,Metallic residue on food after second use :(,"Would have given 5 stars if I was writing it about the FIRST use, but a week (and one gentle hand wash) later, the cheesecakes came out with a metallic residue all around the sides. So disappointing as I was making them for a special Christmas event. f course I cannot serve them now. Will post photos of the tainted cheesecakes here after Christmas.I hand washed it gently and also dried with a soft towel. There was no unnecessary wear and tear on my part. I will be sending this back. If anyone has recommendations on a similar item that does not leave residue, please leave a comment."
4,Cute Cheesecakes But Dry It Well!,"Ok, I've done 2 batches of cheesecake now and they have turned out great. You'll have to play around with your recipes to scale them down and adjust the baking time but it hasn't been too hard so far. Now, the caveat on this whole review...when I got this pan, I washed it first and left it out to air dry. By the next morning, there were already rust spots where the cups of the pan meet the top part. I will have to be super careful to hand dry it immediately after washing."
5,Great for mini cheesecakes,"You all know how cheesecake slices can be too much after dinner etc. This solves that problem with small mini cheesecakes made in a removable bottom pan. I found that there was a little leakage, just as with any cheesecake, just put another pan beneath it to save your oven. I f I remember correctly, it takes a normal cheesecake recipe amount. The pan itself is sturdy and easy to clean without any special preparations. Recipe and tips on the box work fine as does your own recipe. Unique and lovely for those wanting different toppings. Very versatile. Can't wait to try it for other recipes: for example, would angel food cake work in this? WE'll find out.... what fun!"
5,Great Product,Ordered this as a last minute Christmas gift. Arrived quickly. Very easy to use and makes really cute bite sized desserts.
3,Nice,I really like it. I have been wanting one for along time and I love it. It is very good quality.
5,Excellent pan!,"This mini cheesecake is excellent and really easy to use! I tried it out for the first time last week and I had no problem with it. The mini cheesecakes came out really easily, and tasted wonderful as well. I used the pan again the next day and it was just as easy. I will continue to use this again and again. The mini cheesecakes come out so cute!"
1,Great mini cheesecakes but horrible to clean,"My kids and I spent several hours and lots of time laughing while making a hundred mini pumpkin cheese cakes and we were super happy with the outcome. On the side though, we washed them properly and the tarish came off. Completely off, which meant we could no longer use them. Fun but doesn't clean right. Had to send back."
3,Unpleasant Surprise,"The cups in this pan are WAY smaller than I expected them to be! I am sending it back. I can't imagine going through all the trouble of making a cheesecake recipe only to have each serving come out so small that it would be unsatisfying and require multiple helpings. The foil liners that normally use inside my cupcake pan when I make mini cheesecakes dont even fit into these cups (I know, I know, the removably bottoms...but still! It's such a silly product when they could just make the tin with slightly larger cups."
1,Poor Product Quality,"After using the pan for the first time I soaked it in soap water to make it easy for washing. Unfortunately, the pan got rust and turned different color and texture. The product material is very poor quality and I DO NOT RECOMEND it."
3,Dishwasher Safe?,"I really like the pan design and it is great for small tarts, etc. They pop right out of the pan with the small removable bottom disc design. However, the company should remove the ""dishwasher safe"" remark from the box. I have used my pan once and I'm a little nervous about using it again. It rusted in the dishwasher on the first wash. I thought about asking the company to replace it, so I could have one that I could hand wash in the future. What a pain. Just hand wash and you should be fine."
3,Pieces missing,I haven't used my mini cheesecake pan yet since I only received 11 bases for the 12 cavity pan!! If I know I'll be getting another base in the mail I'll use it but if not it is being returned.
5,I just LOVED IT SO MUCH!!!!,"So easy to cook on this pan and I have made wonderful small pies on it , so so great!!!"
1,"Good book, but look at the freakin' price!","I'm a literature professor, too, and I was thinking of using this brief, informative book as required reading for an upcoming class on the American novel in the 20th century. But then I saw the price!The full retail price is more than $90 for such a little book -- no illustrations, no glossy pages, none of the things that make science text books so expensive. It has about 120 small pages of text.Even its discount price of about $45 it is outrageous. Such a price nearly guarantees the book's failure on the market, however useful it might be. What student can afford that? Bedford Books must be staffed by either fools or King Midas's children."
2,They ain't what they used to be.,"I guess I'm a throwback to the days when short stories were really stories: Hemingway, Anderson, Poe, London, even Stephen King. They had plots that moved, characters you loved or hated--page turners! Now, most SS seem to be emotional trips through someone's looking glass, vague attempts to reach into the reader's psyche for a response that we (I) have to work to deliver.But it's probably me. I am well aware that some of these stories were originally published in The New Yorker, Ploughshares and The Paris Review, but most do not satisfy (me).Modern short stories may be the height of literary excellence in 10,000 words; If these are ""The Best American Short Stories,"" I think I'll go back to novels, where you can quite often find a work of fiction that is both elevating and hard to put down."
2,"If this is literature, give me pulp","I confess to giving up on this year's collection after reading about half of the stories, because, in fact, there wasn't a gripping tale in the bunch. Those I did read lacked dramatic tension, interesting characters and a distinctive author's voice. If these bloodless exercises are what high school and college students are introduced to as the ""best,"" it is no surprise so many conclude that reading as a chore and not a pleasure."
1,Disapointing,These are suppose to be the best of the best and I was very disapointed. I was looking forward to ready something new and different but now I am turned off from short stories. The stories in general were depressing. Many didn't have a point or clear story. I only liked a couple of the story. I read this book as part of my book club and none of us were impressed.
1,"Mostly a collection of boring, pointless stories.","My daughter was assigned this book over the summer for her IB English class so I read it along with her. I enjoyed reading the rest of her assigned books: ""Pride & Predjudice,"" ""Travels w/Charlie"" and ""Frankenstein,"" but have to say that BASS of 2006 was PAINFUL to get through. I admit to a preference for novels and might expect a bit more from short stories. These short story authors may know some of the mechanics of writing, but, with very few exceptions, don't have a compelling story to tell. There is nothing like an O. Henry or ""Incident at Owl Creek Bridge"" among them - no plot twists, no surprises, nothing to make a story memorable. I don't blame Ms. Kenison for giving up! Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of ""Welcome to the Monkey House"" by Kurt Vonnegut or ""Jump"" by Nadine Gordimer. There you will find stories that surprise and amuse you."
1,Stained a favorite blouse,"ACK! I used this on a blouse, and it left a STAIN! there are no warnings about staining on the product label. The label even suggests spritzing on. Phooey!!!!"
2,"A Jazz record, as kitschy as the event itself","Oscar Peterson is one of the greatest pianist in Jazz and a very gifted composer. Unfortunately, this is not the record to prove this particular point. The whole affair is overblown and overdone, and only occasionally you can catch a memorable idea. Of course, the wedding of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, was pure kitsch, and the record lives up to that, but too much is too much. The intro to ""Heraldry"", which you can hear on the site, can only be considered a bad joke, but one I did not get, especially considering the more jazzy and quite lively middle part of the piece. ""When Summer Comes"" is a nice ballad, one of the more memorable tunes on the record, but in general this is simple Big Band pop, something which was far better done by the likes of Wes Montgomery and others. Not a highlight in Peterson's career. I wonder why this should be an ""Orignal Jazz Classic""?"
4,"Nice compact unit, seems well made.","Nice compact unit, seems well made. Have found some words that do not translate right according to my Chinese friend. Reading through the included Chinese Idioms is very interesting. Backlight is a nice feature and the battery life is exceptional, we use it quite a bit and it still has the original batteries. Never tried the USB connectivity or audio capability.Drawbacks: Pronunciation clarity is a bit lacking, quite a drawback when trying to use it as a learning tool. Uses 'v' for u (with oomlat) key for entering Pinyin spelling (corrected per feedback comment!). A nuisance ""boot time"" every time the unit is powered on, maybe 10 seconds."
3,"Ok, not the best for its price","I was very impressed with this translator at first - it does work very well to translate from chinese Pinyin, and it is of fairly good quality, but I am now no longer quite as impressed, after buying a nicer one with more features (including a writing pad where I could write what a chinese character looks like and it would look it up for me and find the Pinyin, a feature this one sadly neglects, though it does have a dictionary based on radicals) at 75% the price [although, I bought the other one in Taiwan and don't know how readily available it is here]. So, all in all, it's not a bad translator, but certainly not the best buy for your money"
3,Expensive translator - poor sound,"Beware! This translator does not translate to pin yin, and the speaker volume is very low. The dictionary does pinyin. I might update this review if I find more - good or bad."
5,Pope John Paul II,This is a beautiful story even if you are not a Catholic. Very uplifting. John Voight was so believable as Pope John Paul. This was one of his best performances especially since there was so much available about the Pope through the years. He had his mannerisms down perfectly. The young Karol played by Cary Elewes was also very believable. He gave the sense of how angry one can become and yet he tried not to harm anyone. Not an easy task for a young person caught in those awful times.My only problem was...no English subtitles which I did not know when I made the purchase. It would have helped.I think movies should state when there are no subtitles.
5,Even an Adventist enjoyed it!,"I'm not Adventist, but my friend is and they enjoyed this movie as much as I did. Well done, must watch!! Great movie for the collection."
4,Thoughtful & Compelling Portrayal of a Beloved Figure,"Cary Elwes and Jon Voight lovingly and skillfully portray one of the most beloved figures of our times. The research and numerous interviews with the Vatican and Pope John Paul II's close associates, make for a humorous and insightful storyline. It emphasizes his connections with Poland even after he becomes Pope and the ""little stories"" that reveal his humility and his devotion to God and to his friends and homeland. This is a much more personal and intimate portrait than we are accustomed to, and it was very moving.The lead actors are excellent and the pope's devoted assistant and his secretary of state are especially interesting. Karol Wojtyla's fellow cardinals from Poland are played powerfully by Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings) and James Cromwell (Babe).On the down side, this was made as a TV movie and the budget limitations show in a number of the crowd scenes. Sadly incongruent with the overall quality."
5,Great movie,"I was born in Warsaw, Poland and I was only 8 years old when Karol Wojtyla became our Pope. I think this movie is excellent, true story.There are some political and historical inconsistencies - but only Pope and his polish fellows would know the difference. Besides it - A+ ! Jon Voight did wonderful job portraying this great man. God Bless Him."
5,Magnificent and rewarding!,A very faithful rendering of the late Pope John Paul II's biography. Jon Voight is at his best! The feature starts with the Pope's assasination attempt in St. Peter's Square and then moves to flash backs of Karol Woytyla's life. A stunning performance that communicates the spirit and hope this Pope has instilled in us all. A must see!Mgr Alexander Cordina
4,Tortured genius,"This strange CD consists of 7 tracks from the legendary Massey Hall concert of 1953 featuring the rhythm section from that night only(Powell, Mingus, Roach), 4 tracks of Powell, George Duvivier (bs) and Art Taylor (d)from a 1953 nightclub gig, and 4 tracks featuring pianist BILLY TAYLOR (not Bud Powell) dueting with Mingus. The inclusion of the Billy Taylor tracks makes no sense whatsoever (Fantasy Inc. has chosen to keep them, because Charles Mingus' Debut label, which originally produced the LP, mistakenly included these tracks for years). In the Massey Hall performance, Powell vacillated between brilliant up-tempos and overbearing, thick, pounding ballads that I found disturbing and hard to take...however, Bud is perfection on ""My Heart Stood Still"" (from a 1953 club date), and ""Embraceable You"" is a haunting and wonderful ballad that does not suffer from the heavy block chords of ""Polka Dots"". These two tracks are worth the entire album."
5,Deep Powell,"This collection is a treasure--and not just for reasons many Powell commentators put forth. Look beyond the fact that seven tracks are from the trio portion of the legendary Massey Hall ""summit meeting"", and get into the material. Two of Powell's most interesting ballads are here. The version of ""Embraceable You"" here is the definitive one, mysterious, poignant and alive---arguably one of the best interpretations of the composition ever recorded. Similarly, ""Polka Dots and Moonbeams"" is superior and emotionally more complex than the more conventional (and more popular) treatment recorded on Blue Note. Finally, ""My Heart Stood Still"" is Powell at his fleeting, snaking best at the height of his powers."
5,Among Bud's best,"Bud Powell once acknowledged that his favorite pianist was Thelonious Monk. What's always fascinated me about this Massey Hall + material is the way, on the slow ballads (SURE THING, EMBRACEABLE YOU, MY DEVOTION), Powell plays so much like Monk. Bird once said that ""the Monk runs deep,"" and Powell plows that deep furrow of Monk's marvelously here. On the up-tempo selections Bud is the penultimate fleet-fingered bop pianist, with CHEROKEE and HALLELUJAH being prime examples of Bud at his best in this groove. Max Roach's brush work on these swingers is also terrific. Bassist Charles Mingus, whom we can thank for having these recordings at all, is right on top of things in his forceful, striking style. These are among Powell's finest live performances."
4,A great single,"Tiga's Pleasure From The Bass is a great single. Although it lacks in the different versions or various DJ/producer reinterpretations on the CD single it's quite the good track on it's own so it really doesn't need the addl. remixes, etc. Although this track is almost two years old it still sounds great today. Worth checking out if you haven't!SJwww.beatzblog.com"
4,Some Unique locking,"I found some of the locking in this book pretty unique. I have yet seen them elsewhere. They do come on extermely tight. Some of the techiques in this system are a bit too show boating for me, but coming from a Korean art would you expect anything else. A definately great addition to locksmiths library, It would have been a little better if they made the book in a larger format so that one could better see the locking sequence.

4,Big League Sales Closing Techniques,I purchased Big League Sales for a Sales Person where I work and her salesimmediately went up. The feedback on this book has always been very positiveand I wish the powers that own the copyrights to this book would publish itagain. It was expensive but worth the investment!
1,The Scientology Sales bible,"This is the Scientology sales book, also known as 'Big League Sales'. If you are a Scientology staff member for very long, eventually you will see this book, either in this form, or a photo copy. This is the book that they use to train all staff on how to hard-sell Scientology services and materials to the masses. This is one of the few books that LRH mentioned and liked so its now permanently part of their teachings. It is a very short and crappy sales book, that can be read cover to cover in an hour or two. It is very basic and does not have many examples or techniques. Thousands of Scientologists all over the world have been drilled on the techniques in this book. Don't waste your money, just get a more modern sales book that is more well known and has more and better examples. This book is set in the 50's or 60's if I remember correctly so it is very out of date, and a lot of the advice in this book is not relevant to the 21st century."
4,simply wonderful ! A trancendental journey through the past,A summation of every aspect of who this man was and how inspiring he remains. He simply bares his soul to the reader in his unique and scholarly style.
5,Hot Wheels,"My kids (ages 4 and 7) love this game and they play it with their Dad and I. So, it's fun for all ages."
3,Just Fine,"This product works as advertised and I see no loss in quality of video transmitted using this. For the price, this was just the ticket.*UPDATE* Previously 5-stars, now 3. The 10 ft extension failed May 15 so maybe it worked well for a low cost cable for 8.5 months."
5,Does what it's supposed to!,"Very handy cable, have them attached to my wired mouse and keyboard for PC gaming on the TV. I would go wireless, but any hardware malfunctions and I get fragged!Shipped within a reasonable amount of time"
4,Couple Skills,"The book was helpful in my career as a ""para-professional"" or lay counselor. The reading was easy and not alot of legalistic wording."
5,I recommend to all my married friends now,"This book can really save a marriage, even if read by just one partner. This made me realize my own role in contributing to the problems in our marriage, and gave helpful advice for how to approach potential hot issues in a more productive, caring manner. I can't praise it enough. Much of this may be just basic psychology, but it works! I have bought a few copies to give to friends."
3,Okay Book,This book is okay. It opened my eyes to the different communication blockers. Many of the exercises require your partner to work through them with you. If you're just looking for something to teach yourself to be a better communicator or your wife/husband isn't willing to work on things with you the book won't help much.
5,An insider's story,"I bought this book several years ago and have just re-read it.It's an interesting look at life inside the Royal Family. Well, at least one part of it. The self-centeredness of Prince Charles is not surprising. He expects every whim to be catered to without question and immediately. He comes across as very spoiled and out of touch.Princess Diana is another matter. Her instability is so apparent. It is too bad that she did not get professional help.The last sentence, ""But where is it all going to end?"" is sad when you think about what happened to Diana.The author doesn't take sides, but has given us a good look into the private lives of a very unhappy family."
4,Wow...never knew...,All the books about Diana and Charles are very partial to ether pro or against them. This book in my opinion was a very honest experience living in the household in the middle of the storm. It made me take a step back and really examine my views on what I thought about these people. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes to view Diana as a 'saint'.
5,good insight.,Very interesting book by a woman who has really no axe to grind either pro or negative about charles and di...I found this very good reading and very interesting. A good look at charles and Di.....
3,"Slight, amusing and more than a little pretentious","It's a fun read, no doubt about it. Being a Midwestern girl, I'll never know what it's like to be a royal and I found this insider's view fascinating. To be fabulously wealthy, yet get all manner of freebies and presents. To have a staff there ready to wait on you, yet to never be away from their judgemental eyes. What a life! No wonder both Charles and Diana were spoiled and far from perfect. I don't see how anyone could be remotely normal given the lives they led. For this peek into Highgrove, I was grateful. However, Ms. Berry herself seems rather unlikeable. Always gossiping, making sure we know that's she's more educated that the Prince and Princess realized, saying that Diana never would have ""dared"" lose her famous temper with the housekeeper, it kept me shaking my head. Like other, I'm sure, I suspect if she didn't take this job in the first place just to pen a tell-all."
3,The Housekeeper's Diary,"The book looked in really good shape, however, half way through reading the book, there were many hand written comments in the margins and even in the paragraphs = extremely distracting and annoying. I don't appreciate reading what someone else thinks about particular items that were documented."
2,Only One Real Good Fight On This Double Disc Event,"Does it have special features? Yes, but, all they are is Coleman and Randy giving each other compliments. Nate or Chael are no where on the special features aside of the fact that they were the only good fight on the card. The rest of the fights are snooze fests. Paulo Thiago pulls off a great sub and beltran and serra get easily predicted tko. Mardquart and Sonnen are the stars of this whole card. Buy something else..."
3,Can't win,"The color I got this time looks like talcum powder. The last color I got was ok, but dark for what it's called. So, I ordered 'fair,' one color lighter - & it makes me look like Marcel Marceau. I like this organic face powder and I like the fact that the packaging is recyclable, but the colors need to be called what they are. Also, the colors would be best if they were more like other makeup colors that actually match skin tones."
4,An excellent book on the conflicts in Central America,"Mr Musicant did a marvelous job on detailing the various US military interventions in Latin America over the last century. The details and facts were easy to follow and the characters were most interesting and colorful. The chapters on Nicaragua, Haiti, Cuba and Panama were most informative, detailing the military and economic phases of the interventions. The cast of characters ranged from Teddy Roosevelt, the wiley Charlemagne, Marine general Joe Pendleton, Sandino, legendary Chesty Puller to name but a few. The assaults on Grenada and Panama were most interesting. The book was both enjoyable and well written. Check it out."
4,Brilliant different styles of songs in one CD. Buy It!!!!,"Robbie Williams-I've been expecting youThis new album shows yet another great example of Robbie Williams work and proves he can make it in the pop world on his own, without Take That backing him instead. This new album has a large contrast between slow, soft songs to his usual up beat style. This album definitely shows a wide range in styles. ""Millennium"" has to be one of, if not the best song on the album. It has a catchy chorus and brilliant lyrics throughout the song. The song has a steady and powerful drum beat, which lasts throughout the song. ""I've been expecting you"" is a great album for people who like variety in music, which is all compact on one CD. Robbie Williams-I've been expecting you gets a star rating of 4/5."
4,"Really up-beat, individual and psychotic","Yes, we DO have CD in South Africa! Actually mine has been so worn out from playing track number 12 on 'I've been expecting you', that my player is giving me a bit of grief lately. This is a FAB album, and the contributions of Neil Tennant and World Party do NOT go unnoticed. Just one question: Why are there 2 hidden tracks on song number 12? (I dont know if this is because of an error in production, but listeners need to know that these two songs are there - they are truly worth the listen). Perhaps it is just on the South African release but these songs are at about 16 minutes and 28 minutes on track 12. The second of which ('I've been hanging around'?) seems incredibly sardonic. Who was the victim Robbie? You or her? Anyway, a fantastic CD (and that coming from an alternative 'junkie'). Keep it up!"
5,The Bad Boy Of Rock Is Back!!!,"I think thats one of the best CD's ever made! u should buy it soon... ""Millennium"" is a great song , ""No Regrets"" is awesome and the cooperation with Neil Tennent is just great! this is one of the albums u MUST have at home! Robbie was good in TAKE THAT and now he wants to show u how good he is now , and i tell u he is good!!!!! buy it - worth every pound."
4,Great music,"Got this mostly for Millenium but the style of music is one I really enjoy. I was really surprised when I started paying attention to some of the LYRICs, but you can't have everything."
4,Different from Life Tru A Lense,"Like most ppl I as looking forward to the release of the new album. When I first heard the songs, I have to say, they weren't what I expected. In most songs am 'waiting' for the upbeat/rocky sound. But it doesn't come, so the song leaves you hanging. Some others r really good. Like ""Karma Killer"", ""No Regrets"" and ""Jesus..."". They r the specific 'Rob' tracks I like.DON'T FORGET the HIDDEN TRACKS...BOTH... Especialy the last one which also is very different from his usual style.IN A WORD: I've Been Expecting You is different and you need to get used to it. But once you are... you'll love it."
1,junk.,It's good to see that butt-ugly british import Robbie Williams failed to make his mark in the states.
2,Disappointed,"I can't beleive that this book has a 5 star rating. I just couldn't get into the characters at all. There really weren't many characters to get into. The story was not easy to follow. Kind of choppy. It seemed like the whole story changed in one turn of the page. Sarah kept her distance until almost the end then I turned the page and WOW everything was great between her and Michael. I was glad to finish this book so I could get on to a better story. I enjoy authors of historical romance like Kat Martin, Lynsay Sands etc. I thought this book to be boring. was boring."
4,Necessity Rules,"A next movie of war casualties, this time in modern Iraq, depicts female US journalist in relations with US operative, exploring possibilities outside the Green Line.Loyalty to the USA and own people is questioned with a reality of day-by-day survival locals exposed to.A good reminder of what could happen on the streets of a world distant from Iraq if no US courage to preserve infection where it developed."
5,It has aged well,"Nobody needs more superlatives about this movie. All I can add is it remains one of the definitive movies about the teenage experience, even after almost 40 years, and does not appear the least bit dated. Just as important, it isn't easy to categorize simply as a ""Coming of Age movie"" since it deals just as relevantly with the issues of having one's best years behind oneself (Sam the Lion, and by extension, the town itself) not to mention the struggles of being trapped in a loveless marriage (Ruth Popper & Lois Farrow being two strikingly different sides of the same coin). It continues to strike a chord on multiple levels.A true classic, made all the more remarkable by the fact that Bogdanovich made perhaps two more movies after this which were remotely worth a damn. But I guess having one classic to one's credit should be enough."
5,the myth of sisyphus,"A great film yet troubling in its apocalyptic message; in the sense that its a haunting reminder of what life really is about.Like the mythical king of corinth whos attempt to capture the powers of the gods ended in his being punished in hell with the hopeless and meaningless task of pushing a rock up a hill to a ledge that does'nt exist! Its interesting to note that the teens neither the adults in the film every express any real desire to attain anything in life. This is the real haunting aspect of the movie. The french philosopher Paul Sartre desribes it as ""existential suicide"" where the individual faced with absolute freedom can find no worthwhile endeavor in life to direct it. Beings who are ever faced with ""nothingness"" before us.The film is pure Shakespearean tragedy""to be or not to be"" that is the question!Underneath its actually a film noir."
4,The Last Picture Show,"Being a Ben Johnson fan, I wasn't disappointed. I was surprised Larry Mc Murtry actually wrote something worth while. It is an interesting story most people growing up in the '50s can relate to, even if not raised in a small town. Good acting by big names getting a start on their careers. Worth watching."
5,Nostalgic Classic,"This is a great trip down memory lane to see many of my favorite actors in their youth (Cybill Shepherd hasn't changed much). Anyone who has grown up in a small town will identify with the love/hate relationship these characters show for small town life, especially when everyone knows your 'dirty laundry'. Though there isn't much action, the relationships between friends/parents/townsfolk is heartbreaking. Great movie for 'classic' collectors of all ages. It's especially interesting that this movie was originally rated 'X' in its time. By today's standards, it's relatively 'tame'.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,Morons!,This is a movie about morons. If you like morons or are one yourself you'll like this movie.
5,I was there,"I grew up in Olney, TX just 20 miles south of Archer City where most of this movie was filmed. Some of the scenes were filmed in Olney like the inside of the theater, the Lovett-Meredith Clinic, and the Hamilton Hospital where I was born. It was very true to what growing up in a little West Texas town was like."
3,Last Picture Show,"An amazing movie. Frankly, I agree with the glowing reviews of the film and I have nothing to add to them. However, concerning the quality of the restoration to DVD I must say that it appears that the widescreen formatting was done incorrectly. If you compare the image of the film's opening with that in the documentary(disregarding the full frame), you will notice that the area below the steps of the moviehouse, in the documentary, reveals the begining of the street. In the film itself, this has been cut off. You can also compare the image of Cybill Shepherd on the back of the DVD cover that shows her feet as she steps out of her car. In the film, this is also cut off."
3,Heavy censorship and chopping off ending of DVD,"the original version was much longer and had no censorship of the nude episodes, It also showed hoow this young man, with the help of the concessions lady repaired the theater and tge projector and began to run a successful theateer whiich made some profits.This DVD heavely censored the nude scenes and fore shortened the movie so it made no sense. A very reprehensive act."
3,Last Picture Show dvd,"Saw this movie 39 years ago. Good cast, took awhile but made you think about some aspects of human behavior that hit close to home. So I bought this to revive a memory and remember why it was a good show. The format made it unplayable in my dvd player. I don't remember that the format was advertised. This is the 3rd dvd I've purhcased through Amazon that had this problem. It infuriates me, and therefore this purchase was a waste of my money."
3,Face the emptiness of a small town.,"The Last Picture Show is considered to be a black and white classic but this film just left me depressed. Cloris Leachman is the best thing in this downer, her performance is so heartbreaking (she won an Oscar for best supporting actress). Cybill Shepherd lives up to her own stereotype, pretty blonde who sleeps with everyone in town, her character is so unlikeable. I just thought this movie was just ok, decide for yourself."
1,Pet Pads,"The ""Wee Wee Pads"" were advertised by the exact brand name found in the pet stores I frequent, so I thought the product would be exactly the same. Sadly they were not even close. They are significantly thinner, have rips in the plastic protector sheets and are strangely sticky.I would definately NOT purchase them again from this vendor."
2,Stinko Wee Wee pads,"I thought I'd found a real bargain. What I found were very very thin pads. The leaked. Very flimsy. Save yourself aggravation. Get Four Paws WeeWee Pads. Cost a little more but they are soooo much more. Any pads that say ""medical incontinent""....do not buy. They may be good for mice, not dogs"
2,shatzie,"I thought these were ok for the most part, very very thin and my puppy soaks them thru, not safe for hardwood floors, not a very sturdy plastic, but ok for my puppy she's 2 lbs..."
5,McLellan would rather not lose than win,"A top notch book, which should put to rest any arguments in defence of Gen McLellan. Although an excellent organiser and very popular with his army (possibly because he rarely endangered them by actually fighting) George McLellan was did not possess that primary military requirement, the will to win. At the outset of this campaign he had enough advantages (superior numbers, the Lost Order) to ensure a strategic victory, but ended up with a tactical defeat and at best a strategic draw. Although some of his subordinate generals were of ordinary quality, leadership starts at the top and the young Napolean sorely lacked that characteristic (having double vision whenever he turned his telescope toward the Army of N Virginia did not help his mental attitude either). Antietam represented George Mclellan's opportunity to prove his detractors wrong, and to sieze greatness, but he proved true to form, let the chance slip and went home in a sulk."
4,Excellent work--the standard for Antietam.,"Sears does an excellent job combining a first-rate overview of the battle, a solid analysis of the combatants and their actions and keeping the book a good read. Landscape Turned Red reads quickly and is very informative, providing great detail in the text as well as copious footnotes. Any student of Antietam should begin study here."
3,Simple Platformer,The game is well designed but jumping can get a bit tricky. Levels are challenging but not frustrating. Graphics seem just a bit too pixelated.
5,Love it!,I love this game. It looks great on the gba. I heard it looks great on the other consoles too but love the gba. This game was fun and challenging. Recomend it to anyone.
4,BEST GAME EVER,"This game is awsome. Acting as tak, fighting, and climing vines. One bad thing about this game is it saves every time you beat eight levels.Over all I recomend this game, it is VERY fun."
5,quality plus!,This mincing knife is a very high quality product. It is very sharp and easy to use. It is fun to use and does a great job chopping and mincing.
5,Great when making a chopped salad!!,"I first found this item at a gourmet food and grocery store in Evanston, IL. They used this to make all of their chopped salads. It works perfectly to chop your vegetables, legumes, meats, fruits, etc to virtually as fine or as chunky as you would like. It is quick, easy to use and I love it!!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this product for chopping herbs. Knife is incredibly sharp. But while it cuts well, moist leafy herbs get caught between the blades. And because of its sharpness, you have to be careful dislodging them back on your board for another chop. You also have to be careful how you store it, as it doesn't fit a knife block or similar storage solution. It works fine for ""dry"" herbs like Thyme or Rosemary, but it won't work very well on Cilantro or flat leaf Parsley. Overall, a regular single blade knife actually works better."
4,Great for chopped salads!,"The knife is great for chopped salads. Only negative is that it is just a little small, especially if you like to use two hands to chop a little faster. Otherwise, it is very sharp and cuts most raw vegetables very easily. I recommend cubing raw vegetables before using the mezzaluna to make it more managable and easier on the blades. Overall great value."
1,Sharp Unprotected edge. Be careful,"I saw this in action, and it looked great. But WARNING: the extremely sharp blades are unprotected and you can easily pick it up by the wrong edge and cut yourself pretty badly. It should come with some rubberized cover."
5,Awesome!,"I bought this item because I have rheumatoid arthritis and sometimes have a difficult time chopping veggies. This knife makes it so much easier on my hands and wrists! It takes the pressure off, and for more difficult to cut items, I can easily use two hands. I highly recommend this knife!"
2,Historical piece related to the reconstruction of France,"Jacques Ellul originally printed the book in 1946 in France (so the timing at the end of the war and the reconstruction of France is pertinent). It is translated from the French by Marguerite Wieser and published in 1960.The book is an argument that attempts to establish the authority of the Church as a legal institution that should be a significant influence in determining laws. This quote shows the link: (p. 123) ""...subordination of State to Law - human law is the sign of God's righteousness and the state is the sign (and not only the sign) of spiritual authorities.""As a historical piece that reflects the concerns during the reconstruction of France, this was interesting. Does the argument still offer coherence today? I would suspect from a postmodern or deconstructivist French perspective it does not."
5,Nostalgic,"The price was too much, but I understand due to how old this album is. This is one of the best albums I own!"
1,Does not fit models described,The listing states that this burner fits Kenmore 141.16324 and it DOES NOT. Burner is much too long to fit in this grill.Thank goodness Amazon returns are so easy!
1,Just AWFUL!,"It just goes to show that anyone can ""write a book"" nowdays. Talent, actual experience and knowledge of the subject seem to be things of the past, judging by this author's attempts.Save your money. I wish I had!"
2,"watch ""Wire in the Blood"" instead","I absolutely love british crime dramas and so was looking forward to watching this one. I was apalled at how awful it was!The script was juvenile and the actors seemed uncomfortable and stilted.This is supposed to be about a 'crack' cold case team but their actions in the story were ridiculous and unbelieveable. They all yelled at each other constantly and the dialogue reminded me of 1st grade readers.If real british police actually behave like this, it's amazing that they ever solve a single case!"
4,Another great show from the Beeb !,"The premise was original when this show launched.....crime team reopen closed cases and solve old murder mysteries. Since which time there have been several American versions, none of which compare to the original. The show tends to be bleak and US viewers may find it a tad slow going, but the acting is first rate, especially from Sue Johnston from the 80's Channel 4 soap 'Brookside'. Trevor Eve does what he always does...ie. look very sombre, serious and worried all the time. Since his first series on British TV ""Shoestring' over 20 years ago, he continues to act the only way he is able...very one dimensional ! But the show is brilliantly made, as only the BBC can.I am so very grateful that finally these British shows are making it to Amazon.com as the exchange rate...Dollar to Sterling was killing me on Amazon.co.uk. !"
