1,Crapfest,"Here's the movie. Step one, get some monkeys TOTALLY BLITZED.Step two, take Fearless Hyena 1. Cut out all the good parts. Add some of the throw away scenes/cuts from any movie previously staring Jackie Chan. Splice in a new plot and make all the characters the children of the previous movies characters (that's why the look EXACTLY the same).Step three, sell it to an unwitting public and make a few $$$."
4,Great performance,Oklahoma isn't my favorite musical but the performance was fantastic. If you like Oklahoma the musical u will love this production.
4,Love Jackman!,Very well done! My memories of Gordon McRae in this roll are ever present. But Jackman has done a great job.
5,Renew your Friendship,"For some, Rodgers and Hammerstein's musicals are the very essence (and most enjoyable) part of American Musical Theater. Others would not want to be caught dead near one. Many, like I, lost interest in Oklahoma! with the now very dated version that was available on DVD uptil now.Take heart! X-men's Hugh Jackman plays a very entertaining Curly in this London Stage Revival of this American Classic. Hugh is a ""Triple Threat"": he can dance, sing, AND act. And you'll see ample of that in this very enjoyable production. Hugh danced his own dreamscene.All the performers do a fabulous job, but the highest praise should go to the staging and film production. This musical was filmed twice: once with an audience so the viewer get a real feel of the ambience that only live performances can bring, and once on a sound stage for film-style angles and close-ups. The result is great! You won't regret this purchase."
2,Stage Production or A Movie Production?,"In my opinion, this remake of a classic stage production, which is also a classic movie, couldn't decide which it wanted to be. It tried to be a stage production filmed in front of a ""live"" audience, but there were scenes that could not possibly have been done for a ""live"" audience. Though the audience was shown, on occasion, as if they were there, they never really seemed to ""get"" any of the jokes. It should have been one or the other. Trying to be both lost it for me. Adding smoking and tobacco chewing didn't help either."
1,Rodgers Hammersteins Oklahoma London Revival,It was hideous!! It was a live play that was taped. They were just trying to make money. The original was the best!Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! (London Stage Revival)
1,What is this caca?,"I guess I am just dumb and didn't read the product description. This is not the MOVIE, but some sort of stage play version starring an unknown. Who is this? Can't return it, don't want it, threw it in trash."
2,A SNORE FESTIVAL FROM GREAT BRITIAN.,"""Oklahoma!"" is as close to a perfect American Musical as you're ever going to find; and all this production did was make me appreciate the 1955 film version all the more. Trevor Nunn's pacing is slow to the point of boredom and the sporadic use of a ""live"" audience intercut with dead-air studio footage is distracting to say the least. All this makes it very hard to listen to the participants in the ""Making Of"" documentary on Disc 2 wax eloquently about how this 1999 production is better than the original Broadway version! I love ""Oklahoma"" and was genuinely excited about buying this DVD. I really was looking forward to a fresh new version of this Great American Romp. What I got was a museum piece pressed under glass like rose petals."
4,It has Hugh Jackman- how could you NOT like it!!,"I had seen a live production of Oklahoma and really liked it. I knew that I would like this musical because it has Hugh Jackman in it. He has such a great voice and a very impressive stage presence. I have been walking around singing ""Oklahoma"" today. I am sure I will watch this many times and am happy to have it as part of my musical library now."
3,Can't compare to the movie,"Like any musical that is taped from the stage much is lost when you are not in the audience. What makes this more disappointing is the fact that the show was taped without an audience but they insert it later. I guess they didn't want coughling,cell phones and other noise. The principals are fine but the production lacks anything cinematic. I felt the same way about KISS ME KATE. Stick with the Gordon McRaw movie. These comments come from the original non blu-ray dvd."
1,Doesn't play on either DVD players,My review is this. I ordered this movie thinking it would be great. It will not play on either one of my dvd players.
1,Disappointed...,"with DVD edition. There is no closed caption. I don't understand because when I saw it on PBS there was closed captioning. So, for those with hearing impairment, be warned. Otherwise, I enjoyed the production: especially Hugh Jackman as Curly."
5,Excellent,"I use this play in my classroom. We talk about the beginnings of American Musical Theatre as well as Western Expansion. I used to have to depend on the old movie version of the play, but this is so much better! The performances are lovely and the staging truly gives us a sense of being in a theatre, which is great in a school where the students can't always get to live theatre."
5,One the best musicals out there!!!!!!,"This is one of my favorite movies ever!! It was so good! Everyone did an amazing job, and i love the songs!! If you are looking for a good musical, definitely purchase this one!!!!!!!"
4,Excellent Oklahoma!,"The actors in this play are all above average as is the singing. Hugh Jackman is a multi-talented actor whose talents are well showcased in this version of Oklahoma. It makes for a very enjoyable evening watching a ""play"" on your TV. The ""making of"" DVD is also worth watching. I loved it."
5,Best Ever!,This production of Oklahoma! is going away the best I've seen. The music and choreography is more contempoary without doing injustice to the original. (It's really better than the original.) Moreover this DVD is filmed in an innovative style juxtaposing studio performances with a live performance at the Royal Theatre. Brilliant!
4,Oh....what?,"This is an important recording. It chronicles a major revival of one of the most important american musicals of all time. And it had some innovatons which not only kept the musical fresh, but also broke ground in terms of having the main characters actually dance the dream sequence--and beautifully. The production was precise, on target and captured the real essence of the antagonism between cattlemen and farmers in the early west. Moreover, Judd's character was explored in more depth than in any other production I have seen. Overall, a real tour de force for all the principals. I was, however, disappointed that this was not performed in front of a live audience which always provides that extra energy to any performance. That said, the camera work which caught every nuance in the actors faces was truly incredible. Highly recommended."
4,"If you like Hugh Jackman, you'll love this musical!","I'll admit, I'm a bigger fan of the '50s version of this musical than I am with this rendition. But I still love to watch it! It's so fun to giggle like a school girl while watching Jackman as a dancing cowboy. And sure, they're singing voices are not as big and full as Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae, but again, still enjoyable to watch. It's also impressive to see the original roots of Hugh Jackman as a stage performer, to which he's EXCELLENT. Overall, worth the buy."
4,A new classic in the music field?,"The American musical is part way between being a play and an opera.That a British cast would learn south western dialect ( somewhat badly?) and they would stage a farmers daughter in overalls instead of a dressand make museum props like a cranking milk separator and a wooden windmillpumping tower shows an unexpected respect of the cowboy in London?This show is very different than the 50 year old Hollywood version with it's surreal staging of the dream ballet.This show has finally put the American musical into the category of a cultural production like a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.The British stage company goes to a ""My Fair Lady"" Higgins level of singing the American lyrics ( as many blues and rick songs have been donein Britain) as if they were singing a foreign language.The American west of the cowboy is pretty much gone,but lives on in the cultural heritage."
2,Interesting,"I saw Oklahoma in the film with Gordon MacRay years and years ago, when I was in college as a music major and I loved it. I was already acquainted with most of the music and the story. But I guess I'm used to that older version. This was OK, but the staging and sets sometimes seemed like High School.Also, I felt there were so many endings! Every time I thought it was going to end, it kept right on going. Also there were characters in the show, that I didn't remember. I don't recall the foreign salesman at all, but it was many years ago.The chorus and the music were pretty good, but the dance sequence seemed very different and much longer than I remembered. I also don't remember the auction or the many scenes with Judd. But again I haven't seen it in a long time. When they sang Oklahoma at the end, I thought that was going to be the finale, but then it picked right up again. I finally turned it off.I would love to see the original Gordon MacRay film again, but I don't think it's around."
5,oklahoma,"loved this better than the original!Hugh did a WONDERFUL JOB!I would recommend this to anyone who loves musicals, now I am looking forward to Les Miserables with Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe"
5,"there is nothing like disc #3 in this set,fascinating","i ammtrying to find the others in this 5 disc set.Found disc3 in a biglots store for 2.99,took a chance on it and i would have paid 15.99 if i had known it was this good...and it isnt even ''MUSIC''....hope laser light reissues the set because i am so intrigued by this one disc.....a must have, etern33@aol.com"
4,Where's the index?,"Great extraterrestrial nature sound effects but, especially at the asking price, where is the key as to what sound goes with what planet on what disc and playing time counter position?I remember watching a video of the Voyager expeditions many years ago and, as I recall, in the brief snippets from these recordings used, the planetary environment source of each pariticular sound was identified so the information was, at one point in time, available, most likely in the official Voyager results files.The missing rating star was taken off because of this oversight and because it would top off my enjoyment of these discs to have an accurate planet image to supplement each movement of this scientific ""music of the spheres""."
5,Brilliant!,"I ordered this mainly for the Mary Black performance of ""Song for Ireland,"" but I have to tell you, there are so many high points, from Christy Moore's rendition of ""Hills of Donegal"" straight through to Sinead O'Connor's ""He Moved Through the Fair,"" that it's useless to try to point them all out.Order it...sit back...and enjoy!(Only thing missing was Ireland's greatest rock group, ""The Saw Doctors!"")"
3,Uneven,"There are wonderful entertainers here, but these are not their best performances. Celtic woman or ragus are more balanced and deserve repeat viewing."
4,An outstanding bargain two-fer in this music,"I won't repeat all that I said in praise of Jansons' early Sibelius with his young, eager Oslo orchestra, escept to say that the Second Sym. is the best of the bunch. The Sibelius Third and Fifth are also fresh and appealing. EMI provides very good sound, and the price is certainly right. You can get outstanding individual readings of all three symphonies, of course, and there's no mistaking this ensemble for Karajan's Berlin Phil. or Bernstein's NY Phil. However, in direct rivalry with bargain issues from Rattle, Colin Davis, and others, Jansons and his young musicians come off very well. (See my individual reviews for more detailed comments.)"
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"The Beast is an awesome movie with a cool score and plenty of savage squid action. But not to see the full three hours is not to see 'The Beast'. You will miss major stuff, that makes the movie what it is. Do what I did and wait for it to come on T.V., then record it, and just edit the commercials. Its the smart thing to do"
1,What Shall We Do Without A Drunken Sailor?,"Recently, I ordered the movie ""The Beast"" based on Peter Benchley's book. My plan was to give it to my sister. So I found one at Amazon.com for [dollar amount]. My sister, a William Petersen fan, viewed the movie and was sorely disappointed. Having watched the movie on TV a couple of times, my sister notes two major (major to her) scenes have been cut from the movie....the one where Whip gets drunk....and the other where the mother squid comes looking for her little squid...a nice realistic aerial-type view of both squid in the water. Anyway, so I order another copy, thinking it will have the two scenes included....no such luck. Both scenes are missing in both copies. I wonder...so does my sorely disappointed sister.....What's the deal with this?"
4,THIS SQUID KICKS BUTT!!!!!!,"When I first saw this made for TV miniseries back in 97, I thought it was HOT!!!! Peter Benchley's vision of a giant squid terrorizing an island community is tops on my list, better than his other movie, JAWS. Peter Benchley's CREATURE is a bit better than this title,though. Also read the book!!!!"
3,Silly But Fun,"A lot of people will probably not agree with me on this one, but I actually enjoyed this film. Yes it is a bit silly and far fetched but as a sit down, no brainer kinda of movie that you can relax by I reckon it's a good one. If you take it seriously then you wont like it. The only issue I have is that this is a shortened version to the one that appeared on television so there are many scenes missing which can live you with the feeling of wanting a bit more. Would love to see it come out on DVD in all its full glory."
2,"Sorry, this movie is slow and boring","I copied this movie from the Sci Fi channel and spent most of the movie with the fast forward button--and still felt like I wasted my time. The last 20 minutes or so are watchable, otherwise this is perfect Mystery Science Theater 3000 fare...can the characters make any worse decisions and can there be any more technical glitches? (gee, the battery went out...gee, we had an electrical short...gee, my boat is really old and it [stinks] yet I am going out into the sea to catch the beast...gee, I'm going off alone to save my own [heiny] (guess what happens to this character). 2 stars is all this movie warrants, I will say William Peterson's acting is good and the last 20 minutes are okay, and that's about it."
4,Very entertaining tv movie,"The smartest thing the makers of this movie did was hire William Petersen as the lead. He is a terrific actor and commands attention in any role he plays. This movie is the best giant squid movie Ive seen, although that doesnt say all that much since I havent seen that many. To give it a bit more respect, let me say that I enjoyed this one on about the same level as Jaws 2, which was a very good sequel to the masterpiece."
1,"I I have not recieved my package , or re delivery you have charged my cc and not redeliverd","I recieved a note from the post office saying that my package was available for """"""""Pick up"""""""" and when i went only 2 days later the package was no longer there, note this was on the 27th of september it is october 7th and still no pitcher,AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST MY CREDIT CARD HAS BEEN CHARGE SO PLEASE RE DELIVER PFOR POSITIVE FEED BACK"
2,"A great band....But, THIS DVD SUCKS!!!!!","Well, White Lion was one of the greatest rock and roll bands from 80's, Mike tramp and Vitto were the Jon and Richie from Bon Jovi at that time. The band really kick ass at this concert BUT THE DVD HASA REALLY BAD SOUND, AWFULL IMAGE, it's a shame because they really played very well, they were awesome in those concerts, the company Deadline records and Mike tramp did not a well work presenting a video like this. Anyway! if you are a fan GET IT!"
1,Waste Of Money,"I am a big fan of White Lion, and would be the last one to ever say something bad about them, but this video BEWARE...it's a massive money grab. The live footage is bootleg quality at best. One of the songs, which I think was filmed in NYC, it looks like it was transferred from a 3rd rate vhs copy, not the original source material. I've seen bootlegs with better quality than this. Even if you're a fan, I wouldn't recommend this, because you should get what you pay for. This dvd, you don't get nothing even remotely watchable. The japan footage is the worst. It's so dark, and blurry, ya can barely even see the band. I wouldn't have even released this if it couldn't be up to today's standards.I've seen TV series' that were not remastered, and were still about 500% better in quality than this. So, for any White Lion fans out there, don't waste your money on this, it's a complete money grab, and you'll regret it later. Shame on whoever released this piece of crap."
4,"Beware of a few of the lyrics, but otherwise the album rocks","There are only a few bad songs on here. ""Freak"" is lousy, ""Cling"" and ""What's Left for Me?"" unfortunately are foul, but the music on this album is stunning. If you have a bass enhanced stereo, you'll have no problems hearing the bass on this album. The acoustic rock works incredibly well with these songs, especially considering that the guitar parts are done incredibly well. As a guitar player, these songs wow me. How one can do songs that sound like somewhat folky and yet very depressing is beyond me, but it works on this album."
3,"Acoustic has never been better, but...","After hearing all of the Days of the New singles on the radio, I was really looking forward to their self-titled debut. But after giving it a good listen, I have decided that the rest of the album isn't the greatest. Well, yeah, some of the songs are upbeat, but others can come in annoying. However the three singles that came off the album are some of my favorite songs. First one: Shelf in the Room...great slow paced song to start things off. Touch, Peel, and Stand: my favorite Days of the New Song...it's just great, I can't describe. And ""The Down Town"": This was the first song from these guys I heard, and it's acoustic excellence.So to me, this album is worth buying if you like those three songs...they're great. If not, don't bother with this one. The songs will fall on deaf ears."
3,Better than the REAL Pearl Jam,"Okay, so they want to be Pearl Jam, but maybe somebody should tap Eddie Vedder on the shoulder and tell him to be more like these guys. The first side is a better show of talent than the second, especially with powerful songs like Touch, Peel and Stand, and Face of the Earth. But Shelf in the Room with its enigmatic lyrics, is the song that Vedder and co. have been searching for since Ten. Forget Pearl Jam, go see these guys when they come around. And be on the lookout, you'll probably see Eddie Vedder in the audience taking notes."
1,Typical.,"I'd really like to give this band negative stars but I am forbidden to do that. After giving this album, that's chock full of crap, numerous chances, I came to the conclusion that this band seems to possess a lack of talent due to the fact that they're trying to copy the grunge bands from Seattle. Either they need to go back to the studio and write some original music or put on some tye-dye shirts and hug trees and what not. Do not, and may I emphasize DO NOT, buy this album."
1,Nothing New,"Days of the New have failed to gain my favour. They seem to lack original ideas and rely too heavily on sounds of the past, i.e., Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and the other grunge godfathers. Critical music fans may want to check out the new Mercury Rev or the latest Yo La Tengo albums instead."
1,it's too soft,days of the new sounds like a soft alice in chains. this band needs to rock. they consider this band grunge. they are a soft grunge. grunge is not dead!!!!! there's still mudhoney!!!!!! days of the new should rock hard with a good grunge sound.
2,I want nothing to do with it,"As distraught as I was at the demise of Soundgarden, I was doubly nauseated by this reincarnation. These guys are an abortion. If you are looking for rock with an acoustic bent, check out Guster."
1,Alice in Chains Wannabes,"This album really didn't surpise me. You see, I heard the same crap, when it was called Alice in Chains. I just don't understand the attraction to unplugging an already lousy and uninspired band (Alice in Chains). These girls should sell out and get haircuts like the other crappy bands they try so hard to emulate, namely Metallica and Bon Jovi. And oh yeah, learn to play your instruments."
3,Not the best,"On this record, Days of the New had the opportunity to bring something new to the music scene. I won't say they blew it, because they produced an excellent album here, but what they lack is originality. Don't get me wrong, I love Days of the New...they are one of my favorite bands, but I would have liked to see something new come out of the post-grunge scene. I've owned this album for more than three years now and I still listen to it. It's definitely worth the money. However, the second album is far superior to this one."
3,"OK, this CD is excellent for peeps who like acoustic guitars","This CD is anything but grunge and alternative/rock. I was very disapointed when i bought this. I had heard it was an excellent CD. This CD is filled with acoustic guitar wows and good lyrics, but for the harder rock fans i do not recommend it."
5,One of my favorites,"This is not just accoustic rock. It is a spiraling, melodromatic wave of beautifully orchestrated music. The band is very talented at making very good, very complex sounds that can be listened to over and over again. It is raw, but with a soft, soothing aspect that blends beautifully. Singer Travis Meeks is very talented at portraying emotion with his voice, and although his lyrics aren't worthy of five stars they are decent nonetheless. Listen to this album and I guarantee you will be pleased you added it to your collection."
2,"Why can't they all be like ""The Down Town?""","Pretty boring album, except for the song ""The Down Town,"" which is just awesome; hard to believe it comes off the same record as the rest of the not-so-exciting songs. All of the songs, except this particular one, are way too slow, in the most boring way, for anyone to be able to truly get into it."
3,A great band with a unique sound.,"I guess if you had to categorize ""Days Of The New"" they'd be called grunge, but the term ""acoustic metal"" comes to mind as well. I also must admit, though they're not a copy, the do remind me of ""Alice In Chains"", their slower melodic stuff anyway. Both ""Shelf In The Room"" and ""Touch, Peel, and Stand"" are excellent, and I think got some exposure, and the rest of the tracks are similar to those two. In fact, if I had to point out any flaws, it would be that most of these songs sound the same. But since they're all good, I guess that's ok. Overall it's a good disc, and it deserves a spot in any grunge fans collection."
1,Disappointed me,"""I'd really like to give this band negative stars but I am forbidden to do that. After giving this album, that's chock full of crap, numerous chances, I came to the conclusion that this band seems to possess a lack of talent due to the fact that they're trying to copy the grunge bands from Seattle. Either they need to go back to the studio and write some original music or put on some tye-dye shirts and hug trees and what not. Do not, and may I emphasize DO NOT, buy this album."" - A music fan who has the same idea with me"
1,Tree Huggin' Hippies,"Days of the New, have nothing new to say at all. In fact, if you ever listened to Alice in Chains talk about the rooster or heaven being beside you or what have you, then you've heard this uninspired, utilitarian band too. These guys break no new ground in the post Seattle grunge scene. And while many claim that making a conscious effort to be unplugged was a step into new territory, it is obvious by their unkempt looks and matted hair, that electricity is not available in their neighborhood. And so making the best of what they don't have, Days of the New have failed to get my seal of approval."
4,Let me tell you about it.,"When I first heard this band on the radio I immediately thought of Alice in Chains. I am a huge AIC fan, so I thought I would give this a try. The CD surprised me in many ways. I couldn't believe how young these guys are, and to think that Travis Meeks is just 17 years old and writing songs like this is a little scary. BUT, I give credit where credit is due. They put out an excellent CD. The only problems that I could find were for one, Travis needs to expand his voice range more. He has the potential, I just wish he would use it. Don't be so monotoned. Second, the acoustics are rather monotoned also. This CD needed some electric guitar in it for the sheer fact to add variety. For a first album, I thought is was really good, I just hope to hear more variety in the next one or people will get bored with them real fast. Hurry up guys, we're waiting for the next one."
5,Great rock album,"Though this band wasn't around long, they recorded some great rock tunes, this amazing debut, then quickly released 2 other albums, then broke up and formed ""Tantric"", a mainstream/stereo ready type band. Anyway, back to this album. Right from track one ""Shelf in the Room"", you know you're in for a great ride, one of the best things about this band, was their amazing talent with acoustic guitars, great riffs, vocals, the whole bit. This album keeps you rocking until the last, and long final track ""Cling"" which runs on for over 15 minutes, with only a short period of silence between the bonus track. This is a great 90's rock album you definitely shouldn't miss, check it out!"
4,IMPRESSIVE,"I don't know if these kids were molded by a great producer, or if they are responsible for the sound and the songwriting, but it is still damn good.This band has shown alot of potential. To bad they split. The Down Town was the song that got my attention on the radio, They got an amazingly heavy sound with just acoustic guitars. If you like Alice in Chains you'll like this one"
4,Peachless Life,Days of the New's debut album represents the pure destructive acoustic sound that most Alice In Chains fans praised after MTVs unplugged session. Each track on the self titled debut shows how strong and meaningful this type of music is and how every passionate human being should listen to good old fashioned GRUNGE!
4,DOTN does'nt last,"A fresh new sound that does not fit into a particular style. Dark driven acoustic grunge melodies, rip from the disc like 50-grit sandpaper. This is interesting stuff, TO BAD THEY BROKE UP!"
5,"A little bit depressing, but life's not aways great is it?","Days of the New have an awsome new sound going on in their album DAYS OF THE NEW. The lead singer's deep voice blends with the instruments just right to create a serious, yet beautiful sound. The strange lyrics make me want to keep listening. Their music has not so much anger in it (like most alternative bands), but just a hint of sadness. Very good stuff."
1,Totally Impractical,I am extremely disappointed with this set. The filling holes are entirely too small (approx. the size of a dime). I will not be using them at all and will donate them to Habitat for Humanity so that perhaps someone can get some use out of the salt and pepper shakers.
3,Need more holes,The shakers look very nice but I wanted the salt and pepper shaker to sit on my stove for seasoning foods. There are not enough holes in the pepper shaker to let the pepper come out fast enough for seasoning foods in bulk. If more holes were added or they were made larger I could rate this product as a great value.
4,Not the normal Universal fare,"This is a close as Universal horror movies comes to real acting and drama. Not the usual Universal amusement, this one is dark and interesting in its own way. Brings Karloff and Lugosi together only 3 years after Frankenstein and Dracula. Worth a look."
5,BEST TV SERIES EVER!!,"This show is the best! I remember as a child watching it with my mom and dad. However just recently my dad's friend lent the DVD's to us and i feel in love with it again. It makes you laugh so hard you have you keep going to the bathroom!!! HAHA Also you cannot just watch one episode you have to watch all of them, because you cannot get enough of it! EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH THIS AND YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY WORTH!!!"
2,Surprised by the brand's change,"I've been buying the Flexi brand retractable leashes for over 20 years, and have always been pleased with them. This is the first time that I have not liked one of their leashes, and for the sole reason that they made the retractable cord too thin this time. The result is a leash that does not retract well, and gets somewhat hung up, having the effect of drooping and dragging rather than being taut at all times. I bought this for my chihuahua, who likes to be way out in front and always kept previous leashes stretched to their max. With this leash, and even though he's well out in front, the leash is just not performing as expected.I think if they had stuck with their original cord width, the leash would work just fine.Very disappointed."
3,Candamir,"I am such an avid fan of the Settlers series. My family and I have been playing it for years, I laugh as I think of our old game pieces compared to the new versions that I have seen. I was looking for a strategy game to enjoy with just my husband and I that was different from the Settler's card game (a decent choice- but one we already have); so we decided on Candamir andDominion. After playing both, it was evident that this version of Settlers was way too complex and had too many little pieces to be worth the set up. Now, when given the choice, we choose Dominion every time."
5,Classic,"As a long time fan of westlife, I was somewhat excited to hear that they were releasing a greatest hits. In my experience the extra songs included on greatest hits albums are usually subpar. However, I was pleasantly surprised to hear this song. It is a slower ballad in true Westlife style. However, this song is more mature than many of their other hits. Anyone looking for a quick, poppy, upbeat song should avoid this. Anyone looking for a great ballad should pick this up right away."
5,Best Christmas album of all time,"If I were a writer, I would try to convince you that if you own only one Christmas cd (even only one cd!) it should be this one. It's been a favourite of mine since I was a kid and it seems to get better every year. You'll especially love it if you're a country kid living in the city now...brings back a lot of memories."
5,The Best Christmas Album - Ever!,"This is the ultimate work of Whittaker's career. My family has had it nearly 20 years and it's fresh, fun, and fantastic each and every year. Mama Mary, The Governor's Dream, Darcy the Dragon, It's Christmas Time, and more, all classics! Do yourself a favor -- buy this as a Christmas present for yourself or family. In fact, buy two; you'll want to give one to a friend as well."
1,"Terrible CD, I Love His Other 2","Roger Whittaker's other 2 Christmas CDs are among my most favorite, which is why I took a chance on this 1. However, this 1 is awful - unknown songs sung badly."
5,Childhood memories,"I enjoyed this album as a child and wanted it for my kids. I especially like ""Country Christmas"", ""Mamma Mary"" and ""Darcy the Dragon"" really all the songs are beautiful. Recommend to anyone who likes Roger Whittaker or easy listening music. Roger's voice is mellow and smoothe and the songs are wonderfully arranged."
5,Christmas with Roger Whittaker and Darcy,Roger Whittaker is the best at Christmas music. Darcy the Dragon has to be the best Christmas song ever written. I suppose you could say it's what Christmas is all about. My mother had this on vinyl many years ago and we played it out year after year (warped and scratched though it was). When I saw it on CD on amazon I just had to get it. In fact I bought 2 of them. It took me back to when I was a little girl listening to Christmas songs on the old giant record player and putting up the tree. Buy this CD if you want to experience Christmas songs sounding their best and sung by a terrific singer with the most soothing and best voice. I highly recommend this CD to everyone!!!!
5,Best Christmas Album of All Time,"The songs are unique, powerful, and uplifting. The album is perfectly suited for a magical Christmas at home with family and friend. Having grown up listening to this album, it is associated with all my fond memories of childhood christmas."
5,An Annual Tradition,"A family tradition is buying a new Christmas album each holiday season. Having just about every artist singing every traditional carol has made it difficult to find something novel. Many years ago I purchased an album by Roger Whittaker, and the songs are so unique and the lyrics so engaging that it remains one of my all-time favorites. I lent my CD to my daughter who promised to return it, but I decided to buy another one, and I actually purchased two - one to give to my brother who has also come to enjoy this wonderful singer.I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys holiday music that tugs at the heart."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I purchased this CD for one particular song, that my husband and I remember fondly from years ago - All I want for Christmas... it's a beautiful song. The other songs on the CD were marginal IMO and not the same songs that were on the cassette tape we remember from years ago. So - wish it would have been the same as remembered. That's life."
4,good but not exceptional,"It all depends where you are in the relationship journey. If you are a connoiseur, been to workshop, read lots of books, has created great friendships and lived amazing love stories, then you won't find too much on this CD. If you are in the beginner stage or you just can;t figure out this relationship thing, definitely get it, you will get some insights.On the side, it could be just my impression, but the author kind of creates this aura around himself of a relationship saver. This ""aura"", by the third CD, starts to be annoying to me."
5,A must listen to by all to improve yourself and others,"This audio is for everyone, who wants to try to understand people, especially your spouse and children. I have listened to this five times, and I am still learning, as this tape gives examples with other people in the audio that makes it quite interesting. One situation was when both people were in love, got married then turned around to only be a one sided love. Gary Chapman coached the one person and helped two, and understanding that each of us has things, we love more than the other does. We have been married for forty-six years and I found out how to make it even better, with listening to this tape. The best!"
4,Highly Recommended.,"The product contents reflect a thorough understanding of the expert. With a Ph.D. in Adult Education and experienced in Educational Psychology, Dr. Gary Chapman produces his great work that clearly explains different ways people show their loves and how to response them correctly.He turns a complicated understanding of relationship into simple explanation that make sense and easy to understand. The CDs will guide you different signs of love, educate you to speak the same language as your loved one, which will improve your relationship.You may not realise who loves you, until you listen to this CDs. It benefits me and hopes his knowledge helps you.In addition, there are two options: CDs and a book (published over thirty-six languages and have sold for 5 million copies).The Five Love Languages Audio CDThe 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts"
5,Certain to improve your marriage,This book changed our lives. I have the audiobook too just to help me brush up every once in awhile... The paper book has the quiz to identify you and your spouses love languages.
5,"a must read for anyone in a serious relationship, or before you get into one.","a must read for anyone in a serious relationship, or before you get into one. learn what your love language is, and the one you NEED to receive to be happy and fulfilled."
1,VIAGGIO con Anita,"Don't waste your time or money on this one. With Goldie Hawn and Giancarlo Giannini together (two of my all time favorites and both very funny people and fine actors, I thought this would be one hysterical movie, but I was wrong. It is not a comedy at all, and you will be very dissapointed if that is what you are expecting. Also, the quality of the video is not good. It's very dark."
2,dumb,dumb movie wasted money and waste of time watching.we learn the hard way don't spend your money viewingthis poorly made piece of crap.
5,Absolutely wonderful!,Kavafy is the the perfect guide in our exploration of life. I reccommend this book highly. Edmund Keeley has done a wonderful job in bringing Kavafy's poetry to us.
5,"The Damned is - a masterpiece, a cinematic glory","The Damned deals with the dark decadent sides of a very powerful, very rich, German family pre-WWII. Helmut Berger is spectacular as Martin von Essenbeck. Visconti sets the stage for a brilliant view into a seductive world of the bizzare. A must see, and see again! kind of film. Most do not understand the film, and therefore perceive it poorly. To understand this world one must step back in time to a place and time of extreme wealth, social unrest, political powerful, and decadence. The average viewer must understand this film has nothing to do with average people or average settings."
1,This is the cut version,"This is the ""R"" rated version of "" The Damned"".And all ""R"" rated versions are slightly cut and censoured.When will we see the uncut version ?"
3,A sordid tale of personal amorality and sexual deviance,"This movie sets out to mirror the corruption and depravity that accompanies the rise of the Nazis prior to the outbreak of W.W.11 in the form of the declining fortunes of a powerful industrial family and its slide into a morass of sexual depravity. Best described as being in the genre of a film noir. Watch out for the sinister singing of the Nazi song ""Ooshton Hauston Bergason"" Quite frightening."
3,GREAT FILM - VERY BADLY PRODUCED DVD,"Oh, how disappointing! This is such a great movie and it deserves better treatment. As somebody already pointed out, the sound is aweful, but the compression as well is so low en. It just looks aweful! Shame!"
2,Visconti's grand failure,"From the Director of Death in Venice and the Leopard, comes an appalling mess of a film. While it has visual style, superb looking actors and directorial flourish, it simply goes way over the top. Martin - the personification of evil - is both a child molestor and mother fixated as well as being a transvestite.In the Leopard, Visconti weaved history and cinema together. In the Damned, he creates a parody of that work. The Nazis were one of the great scourges of the twentieth century and 50 million people died to destroy them.Visconti had a great idea of witnessing the Nazi's rise through a Krupp style family, but he simply lapses into poor taste and high camp too often."
4,Visconti's tribute to Thomas Mann.,"""The Damned"" is one of those great intellectual art movies. Luchino Visconti was always an admirer of Thomas Mann's work (""Death in Venice""). Here he tells an epic tale of the rise and fall of a family of large scale industrials during WW2. There are obviously many similarities to real events from that era (see ""Krupp Stahlwaren"") and Viscontis masterful direction gets great performances even from minor actors as Helmut Berger or Rene Koldehoff (german actor who can be seen in some Bud Spencer or Louis deFunes movies !). A great film in every sense of the word and very close to the spirit of Thomas Mann's novel ""Buddenbrooks"".Unfortunately very overpriced and sadly enough not available on DVD"
3,"History lesson, but questionable to extent of truth to it?","I do not know if my inquiry was received, but I will ask my question again. I wrote a review several months ago, and I am very curious as to why it never appeared in customer reviews?Clare Hynes-Popeclarepope@hotmail.com"
4,Baja Missions,A very good guide to the missions of Baja. Have had very little problem finding the missions from the coordinates given in the book. Excellent photography.
3,"""Not too little,too late!","3/08/03 Having purchased this as a 'used book' today ..though that makes events for ""March 8th"" a year late ..it is a prime example that the book is timeless e.g. 3/8/1902 actress Louise Beaver was born (her role in movie ""Imitation of Life"" won her high fame....3/8 is ""Employee Appreciation Day"".....3/8 is the birthday anniversary of author Kenneth Grahame(book ""The Wind in the Willows"")3/8/1913 the USA 's Internal Revenue Service began to levy and collect income taxes"".....(this bits of trivia are incl of the many re people and places ) of the book which is published annually."
5,My Favorite Western,"I do not remember ever seeing this western in the last 24 years. There is just something about it that I just love. The lead actors: Cole, Dutch and Matt Everett are terriffic. George Kennedy is a meany. I bought the DVD. I watch it almost everyday. I love the musical score also. The other actors are very convincing in their roles also. I can't help it, it is like an addicition."
4,Scientology tech,"This is not a beginning Scientology book. It reads like a technical manual for auditors, or for Scientology counselors. It has chapters on Wave Flows, Black and White Aesthetics, Self-Determinism, and The Manifestation of Energy. This book likely works best for an advanced student of Scientology."
3,"Good Book, Except for Belgium Couple",good book except for references to Maggy and Jules F. Belgium. Everything else was suitable to the subject matter and entertaining.
3,"Too much conflict, too little information","I recently met Mark Macy at a demonstration of the Luminator during which Polaroids were taken. While Mr. Macy seems sincere about his work in this field of research, I would like a better explanation of what the Luminator is and does.A few days later, I read this book. Any real discussion of contact and technologies is mired in the conflicts between individuals and organizations. Because of this, it is sometimes a tedious read.One thing I would like to know -- if spirits are eager to contact persons on ""this side,"" why aren't they more often direct and/or explicit in their communications?"
2,Can't We All Just Get Along?,"If you're buying this book to read about spiritual contact from the other side, FORGET ABOUT IT! The bulk of this book concerns the researchers' inability to get along with each other. Macy is too busy trying to tell us who was ""holy"" enough to speak with the other side, instead of documenting the contacts and their content. What a waste......"
3,"Titles, etc. Do Not Rip into Windows Media Player","Watch out if you plan to rip these CD's into Windows Media Player. The titles, performers, composers, etc. info only shows up in WMP for one of the ten CDs, leaving the rest simply listing Track 1, Track 2, etc. Other than that rather serious disappointment, I have been generally pleased with this collection."
3,OVER THE EDGE,I personally think that over the edge wasnt so good. I didnt really like it not only cause one of my favorite superstars fell but didnt die til he got on his way 2 the hospital. thats one thing people keep messing up. the man didnt die in the ring. but anyways the matches wasnt as i expected. to tell u the truth i was 2 upset 2 see them but i did. and far as i seen the best match that night was triple h vs the rock in a leather strap match but the last match wasnt worth the money. all it was was a repeat of summerslam 98 match between austin and undertaker. but this tape cant be faunt anywhere cause or the tragidee of the late owen hart. u will never find the tape and box. only way u couldnt seen it is if u have ordered it as myself on pay per view that night. 12/12/02
1,Tragic night for wrestling...,"I ordered the PPV, thought: it's gonna be good... But I finished crying, after they said about the KING OF HARTS death... I can't believe it.. They should have stop the PPV and the event in that moment... but no Mr. Mcmahon show us that his employes only serve to make him richer... that's sad.LONG LIVE TO THE KING: OWEN HART... Thanks for the memories and for all. ! You were the Hart of US..."
2,Wasn't good,I think that this PPV needed improvement. Owen Hart died which was really sad. Austin lost to the Undertaker because of that a*****e Shane. Road Dogg lost to Bad A** Billy Gunn. But my favorite The Rock beat HHH. This was bad. Rent if you want to see it. But DO NOT buy.
1,Boring!!!,This tape lacked the potential I thought it would have. The main event was good but still could have been better. I am upset with this tape. I don't recommend it to those looking for good wrestling or exciting matches.
2,What Edge?,"I know this video is titled Over the Edge, but really this is the least edgy of all the WWF PPV's I've seen: Have trouble sleeping? Do you suffer from insomnia? Well not anymore! Puy this WWF PPV and you will most certainly fall asleep watching it. The Mask VS. Mask match was a let down by far only showing that Vader looks even uglier with out his leather mask. The only highlights of this video is the point at which Jerry ""the king"" Lalwer ripped a wooden leg off of a ringside guest. (star # 1) and the Dude Love/Austin match (Star # 2). If you must see this film may I suggest Blockbuster!"
3,"Undercard was nothing, but the main event was something!",The main event was Dude Love vs. Stone Cold and it was great. It made main events what they are today. I recomend this tape for the match ALONE!
3,"Disturbing end to a great, great man","This is a moment of wrestling history. One of the greatest wrestlers of the modern day died at this event. I have been watching wrestling for nearly 11 years so hearing of his death was tragic. I felt like a friend had died. Yet I wanted this tape. It's an important tape to have simply because you will not find it, and it holds important footage. I watched that tape once, and I probably will never watch it again. It's a moment in modern wrestling history.As for the matches. Before the accident they were moderate. Afterward they were dreaful. But I understood why. How good you put on a good show after one of your best friends had died tragically. I commend the wrestlers for doing what they did. But the show overall was a disaster."
4,This video captures the BEST main event in WWF pay-per-view!,"I was at ""Over the Edge"" LIVE and it was the best time of my life! I couldn't wait to see the video and once I did it was almost like the reality of being in the Milwaukee Arena! This was the loudest wrestling crowd I have ever been around! Austin vs. Dude Love is a 10! I highly recommend this video to all wrestling fans!"
1,"Please, be smart.",This is the video of Owen Hart falling to his death. Don't buy it unless you are sick and enjoy seeing someone die. It's sad that this is even for sale.
3,Okay,I thought that this was a semi-descent ppv. Most of the matches really were not all that good. The best match was Austin vs. Dude Love. It was a really cool matche and I loved the part when the Undertaker came out to make sure that McMahon officiated the match right. Buy it.
3,Over the Edge 1998,"This was a very good pay per view, but for some reason, the people here are getting it confused with Over the Edge 1999. That was the one where Owen died after falling from the ceiling to his tragic death. This is not that one.Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about the actual event. It was good in my opinion. I would not, however spend $25.00 on it. Stone cold versus Dude love was a excellent match that grabbed my attention by the psychology involved. The segment with the old wrestlers was the biggest waste of space this side of a mannequin rape angle. The crowd couldn't give a rat's bum about them and neither did I.At the beginning of the show we had the Legion of Doom against Skull and Eight-Ball. The match was very boring and uninspired. The funny part is, it ended up setting the tone for most of the show. The only reason I partially liked this pay per view is because of the Stone Coldvs Dude Love.(...)"
4,Okay!,L.O.D v. D.O.A was very cool with high flyin stunts.Double J v. Blackman really sucked.Sable v. Mero was way too short.Kienti v. Bradshaw and Taka was one was the Best.Rock v.Farouq was another showstopper.Kane v. Vader was a very boring match up.DX v. Nation was Okay.Austinv. dude love was the best.Buy it!!
3,Serviceable rendition of this great opera (1863 Version),"** Be warned that if you are buying this for the famous Act I duet ""Au fond du temple saint"" then you may be disappointed. This is the original 1863 version with an attenuated version of that great duet. **This caveat aside Ileana Cotrubas is in good voice as Leila and Alain Vanzo is also OK as Nadir. The conducting from George Pretre is merely pedestrian but the choruses come across quite well.This is probably the best available version of ""The Pearl Fishers"", but we still await a really good version of this great Bizet opera."
2,More like a commercial than a biography,"It seemed more like a commercial for previous and current films based on Jane Austen's books than a biography. I wish they would have focused more on the letters she wrote her sister, Cassandra, and other informaton available to get to know more about the author, not upcoming ""Austen"" movies! I was very disappointed in this DVD! I expected a well researched, informative presentation."
5,What make up should be,This is a universally flattering color. Love Bare Minerals/Escentuals. Purchase a good quality eye shadow brush and apply sparingly. It stays all day. Careful not to spill-as it is a loose powder.
3,"Great size, a little bit flimsy","The cage is not bad. It is a great size for a larger hamster at a good price. The wire is a little flimsy. Having wire as the second level is not great, we put cardboard underneath for the hamster's comfort on the upper deck. The wheel is useless for a larger hamster but that can be replaced."
3,Ok...but don't really hold too much charge,"Well these batteries are ok for the price (I think they were around $6+shipping when I bought them). But they do not really hold as well as a 2900 mAh should....I get about the same charge as I do from a 2500mAh on my Canon S5 (around 100-150 shots w/Flash). But if you are looking for some cheap batteries that work, I guess this is the option for you."
2,Whose PR dept. wrote some of the other reviews?,"Anyone that has read this book needs to read these 5 star reviews and it is obvious they are connected to the author or the publishing company. This has been one of the best mystery series, and until recently, my favorite. The prior book in this series was getting a little weak. Nerds that Kill falls flat. The dialogue is canned, the last couple of chapters appear slammed together and make little sense, and overall a bit boring. I'm sorry to see this happen, but Paul Turner has clearly jumped."
3,It grows on you.,"I hadn't read any of the Paul Turner books previously, nor any other books by this author, but I didn't need to. This book stands alone. I will warn you, the prose is a little clunky, and it can sometimes get confusing who the non-main characters are when they pop back up. But the prose gets increasingly better throughout, and it's rather an engaging mystery overall. As a nerd, myself, who goes to conventions and may even own up to bringing her own sword on occasion, I found his setting engaging and generally true to life. This is a cozy-style mystery, so don't expect deep thinking or character progression. But, if you're looking for a quick read and a fun romp, this is a safe bet. Also, the homosexual angle is extremely minimal. So, whether you are looking for or to avoid that kind of wrinkle, it is barely even noticeable."
1,Too expensive,"This CD is a waste of money. It comes from Japan, so it costs a lot. There are very few tracks on this CD. All of them are remix's and one remix is simply the same as the original except one word is changed! The songs are just too silly and hyperactive. Smile has made these songs even faster and more extreme than the originals. Stick to Smile's original albums and save your money."
4,Too bad it doesn't come with the GPS back plate,"If you have a race bike with a light aluminum handle bar, it probably has a diameter of more than 25 mm. Then this mount is the one you need. It comfortably fits any handle bar with a diameter in the range of 25 to 32 mm. It comes with three rubber strips of different thickness to adjust to the proper size.It is too bad that you need to purchase this mount on top of the bicycle mount that is delivered with the special clipped backing for your Garmin. The standard mount does not fit any rail with a diameter larger than 25 mm.In my case, I switched bikes and my new bike had a wider bar. So I'm lucky to have a mount now on both the old and new bike. But if you start from scratch, and have wide handle bar, you are faced with two purchases."
4,this is the bike mount for the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx,"If you have a Garmin eTrex Vista HCx GPS, do not buy Garmin's bike mount because it does not fit. Buy this rail mount instead to mount the GPS on a bicycle handlebar. The adapter that comes with the Vista HCx clips right in to this rail mount.Unfortunately, this mount is not as secure as the mount Garmin makes for their Edge GPS units and it only allows you to mount the GPS on your handlebar, not on the stem.There is also a small diameter version for thinner handlebars (like many mountain bikes):Garmin Rail Mount Adapter (010-10496-01)"
3,It's OK,"It's a bike mount for a GPS, so there's not much to review. It's a decent design, but seems a bit bulky. The front of the mount is rather fat, so if you mount it too close to your brake cable (as it comes out from under the handlebar tape), you run the risk of over-bending the cable housing, which is no good. So I had to mount this very close to the stem, which solved the problem.The other issue I have is that the mounting clip which goes on the GPS does not ""seat"" on the bike mount very tightly. It ""clicks in"" just fine, but once the unit is engaged on the mount, there is a bit of play in the connection, so if you are riding a nicely stiff road bike, every bit of road vibration will rattle the heck out of the GPS. The solution to that problem is that I wedge a piece of notecard on the mount, which takes up the slack.So, the mount works, just not perfectly. It's just OK."
3,Not the best,This is not my favorite book in this genre.I've read a few others that I enjoyed much more. too general.
4,Horrific Fun With Boris and Bela,"The second teaming of Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff is a fast-paced horror melodrama from the Universal factory. Lugosi delivers a bravura performance as the Poe-obsessed Dr. Vollin, with Karloff playing second fiddle this time around. Highlighted by some memorable Karloff-Lugosi confrontations, ""The Raven"" (1935) builds to a wicked serial-style climax. Vintage horror buffs will not be disappointed."
2,used CD Roger Whitaker,The case on the CD had a large crack in it and it was a gift to a family member. Thank you. Kathy M.
5,"""d20"" supers done well","As a professional adventure game designer and reviewer, and a long-time fan of superhero roleplaying, I've been waiting for a game to come along which featured full implementation of the concepts in the d20 System engine while still engaging superhero play in a fair and balanced way. Steve Kenson has done a marvelous job of that in Mutants & Masterminds, bringing the best of the Open Source rules, losing the worst, and adding new rules that are at once rational, playable, simple and fun. The book design by Super Unicorn is easy on the eye and enhanced by art provided by a dozen current comic book professionals. The book feels small and intimate for all of its 288 pages, and the value received is exceptional, certainly better than those heavyweight core books from Wizards of the Coast. If you love superhero gaming, or if you love D&D but are thinking of a change and yet don't want to learn a whole new game... BUY THIS BOOK."
2,"Good ideas, but requires work to make playable.","The book seems to start out strongly. In it, you have a point-based character creation system, and a superhero power system based around the d20 level mechanic, so that power level scales naturally.However, the failing of the book is that it is based on a 'damage save'. Basically, instead of skill or effectiveness of your abilities, the roll of 2d20 (damage + 1d20, save + 1d20) is the biggest influence on whether or not you succeed. Ever have a first level character have a chance to kill 25% of the time? You will now -- and in Mutants & Masterminds, you start at level 10. This mechanic sinks Mutants & Mastermind from an excellent game to the level of mediocrity."
3,Good game...too bad this is a first draft.,"If you can get past all the typos and mistakes in the book it's a great system. The power level approach to the d20 class problem(for supers games) is just great. The system is one of the most versatile I've ever seen, I've yet to see a character that couldn't be created using these rules. Unfortunately the game appears to not have been proofread. Most of the sample characters are wrong(they don't add up to how much they should cost, don't have prerequisites for certains feats, etc), many of the power descriptions are incomplete and entire sections of the rules are missing(such as whether or not your super strength bonus applies to grapples). If someone had actually taken the time to look the book over before shipping it to the printers I bet it would have easily been a 5 star system. As it is, however, it'll take a healthy dosage of errata to make this game playable."
3,Looks great and fits comfortably - but TERRIBLE quality!,"I purchased two pair of Sudini boots in November 2007 (a tall waterproof leather pair and an ankle boot). They both look great and are incredibly comfortable. However, within two months the heels give with each step (they slide out from under the sole away from the arch) and the sole is detached from the upper at the toe. This occurred with both pairs. My cobbler was able to add stabilizers to link the heel to the sole beneath the arch which will prevent the wobble. But this is just a temporary fix and should not have been necessary after just two months of light wear (1-2 days a week per pair)."
1,puzzles,"What you see online is not what you get! I ordered 12 different (scenes) puzzles and rec'd 7, the other 5 were duplicates. Now my emails are not being answered."
2,puzzle collection,I did not get a variety of scenes - two of each puzzle instead of different puzzles. That means it wasn't as much of a value as advertised. RIP OFF! Didn't get the puzzles pictured either.
5,Worked like a champ,This converter was used daily in Russia for about 3 hours over a 3 week period. It came with extra fuses but none were necessary. It performed flawlessly as expected.
2,Zzzzzz,"I got bored. It's a rather short book, with all kinds of recommendations, so I read 20% before I gave up. Interesting and original premise, though."
5,GOOD BAGS FOR BOTH HOME AND RESTAURANT USE,"These bags can be used at home to package sandwiches.They can also be used for restaurant use.They can be used for preweighed meats and vegetables .So when it is time to cook ,just take the food out of the bag and start cooking . If these bags are used for meats and vegetables they can hold about 8-9 ounces each.They can also be stored in freezers with either meats or vegetables.If stored in freezers with meats and/or vegetables a good idea is then place about 10 bags in a larger plastic bag,then store them in freezer.These bags are not completely airtight.If you are looking for a more airtight bag you need the Glad Zipper Sandwich Bags. Glad Open Mouth Sandwich Bags are much more sturdier then other brands."
5,"No,no,no,no............ yes this is a hilarious series!","One of my two favourite BBC shows (the other is Chef). This DVD has some of best episodes in the series, very recommended."
1,poor,"The disc will play on my computer but not my DVD player. It read something like ""Not available in your area."""
1,Not my favorite British comedy,Some episodes funny - but main character not funny in her delivery - its like she's in on the joke - and that doesn't seem realistic.
5,Great Entertainment!,We originally saw this series on PBS and absolutely loved it! You can't go wrong with this series - great entertainment!
2,Kim,DVD has no menu. Cannot choose episodes to watch must watch entire DVD to see last episode. Vicar is awesome though.
2,No Subtitles,"I got this as a sampler after a friend told me how much he enjoyed the series and found the level of slapstick to be a little over the top. I enjoyed the characters who answered ""No,no,no..."" but found the lack of any subtitles to defeat of the purposes of buying programs on DVD. The bit of telling a joke after the credits was a good thing too. I guess it was just not meant to match up with my taste but it could still be good for others."
5,LOL!,"Need a good and(relatively)clean laugh? You'll find heaven on earth with the divine Ms. French. Each episode will have you longing to reside in the sleepy little hammock of Dibley, with all it's wonderfully dingy inhabitants! My package arrived in great condition and very promptly! I love it!"
4,Love this whole series!,"I love this entire series! I own it and consider it a classic- something I can watch again and again. Once againthe BBC put together a brilliant cast and long running series of quirky British characters in a small village with the main one, Geraldine Granger (Dawn French), as a power pack of morality and witty humor that the people of Dibley need."
4,Good List of Job Descriptions,"If you have ever worked in a resteraunt before, then most of the first half or so of this book will be a little boring. There were some helpful hints here and there, but a lot of the broad concepts I already knew. For example, dating co-workers can lead to problems, work fast but don't get careless, etc.The part of this work that was really useful for me was the job descriptions. I did some searching on the Internet and could find a list that is as good as this book. There are listings for every position that I have heard of and there are descriptions of the job conditions and skills required for the job and (most important to me) standard pay."
4,So does my daughter!,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars was the fact, that my daughter read it after I did. She thought the book was too thin and was negative and the author made it sound like being a chef wasn't a good thing. I told her that in my opinion this was the right thing to do, so many people think that being a chef is all glamour, you see these food chefs on tv, and say I want to do that!! Being a chef is extremely hard work, long hours etc. Many people go into a job, whether chef or something else, with absolutely no idea about the cons as well as the pros. The author spells it right out for you. Especially when you remember he wrote this for his daughter, don't we all want to protect our kids?! I thought it was a definite must read and am so glad I purchased it. He also listed all the different jobs within the culinary industry as well, which there were many I wasn't even aware of. Thank you!"
5,"Trying to find ""Scarlet Ibis""","Well about three years ago my older sister was in hgh school and read this story to me. I loved it, some parts I didn't quite understand until recently when my Literature class started reading it, I'm a freashman in high school. I never forgot about this book and when we started to read it in class I remembered my sister reading it to me. The story has a good moral, which I think is to help others out without getting something in return. I mean this because the only reason the older brother helped Doodle is because he didn't want to be embaressed by his brother's disabilities. Its a great book and you will never forget it."
3,Where's Doodle?,"I remember reading this book as a sophomore in High School. There was this friend of mine that was kind a sickly and stuff. Anyhow, he reminded me of Doodle and I started calling him Doodle. I moved away in the middle of my sophomore year, but everyone else kept calling him Doodle too, even the teachers. I guess it wasn't really nice in retrospect since Doodle was handicapped and ended up dying. My friend didn't die like Doodle, but he did go to Texas A&M."
4,very conusing for a 9th grader too understand.,"OK. It was a very good book, but... it was very confusing. I want to understand more about it I have read it over a couple of times and I am still confused. What gets me the most is it was in my English 9 book. I am subose to teach the storie to the class and I have almost nothing good in my inomation because it is so hard for me."
4,A heart-warming story with a ending that sticks with you,"I reasd the scarlet ibis just two days ago. We had to read it for our 9th grade english class. Our teacher told us it was a sad story~ little did I know how sad...I usually don't cry or get teary eyed over lots of things, but this book really got me thinking. It made me realize how you sometimes hurt the ones you love the most. I recommend you read this book...it will stick with you for a long time and it is very hard to find good realisitc short stories. RIP Lacey & Mrs.Massey and David! What's up to everyone who knows me @ B.B.H.H.S ! I love you guys! Hey Mrs.Lynn and her 2 period English class!"
2,After the Story,"After I finished reading the story i found it's kind of boring but at last it was sad at the end. The ending was really supprise. I never thought that Doodle was going to die, because they had so much fun, some many great things they had done together. How could that be the ending for this story after everything is going so smoothly? the author of this story should make a new and happy ending for this story... but ... HE'S DIED!"
1,Horrid.,"I was forced into reading this last week by my freshman language arts teacher, and I didn't like it at all. The author spent far too much time hinting at what was to come, so that by the end of the first paragraph it was obvious that someone was going to die.I can't believe other people didnt realize this.. but alas...The main character was very cruel, and the other characters were rather flat.I just... didn't like it, period."
4,This is only a story of sadness...,"I have never read such a depressing book. The brother of the story treats his younger brother as any child today would, showing cruelty for being embarassed by his brothers handicap. He only does things for his brother for his own good yet he never knows how much he loves him until he is gone... Throughout the story even when he is joyous with his brother he does not realise what he would miss if he were gone. The only thing I dont like about this is the grotesque ending which forced itself into my mind permanentely."
5,Stories that made me want to read more,I had not read this book since my sophmore year in 1979 back in Arizona. I had forgotten the younger brothers (Doodle) name and on several occassions had tried to relate the story to others. They would look at me with curiosity when I referred to it. It is indeed a wonder how a SHORT story can stay with you so LONG. Literature like THE SCARLET IBIS should be standard in the classroom. Young adults should learn to once again find the pleasure of sitting quitely somewhere and engrossing themselves in a book. Even now when a strong storm blows through I think about THE IBIS and get a lump in my throat. Thank you for allowing me express my admiration for this book.
5,unconditional love,"I loved this story, it was so profound, and it raises the age old question: How is it possible to love a person so much, but still treat them so badly? I think about this in all my relationships. I always relate love and friendship to Scarlet Ibis."
4,good story,"we liked the story because it is a good lesson to learn, and it teach us that no one is perfect. Being different sometimes isnt that bad you still can be smart even though you cannot do a;lot of things"
5,A remembrance from childhood,"I remember reading this in grade school and still remember it today. I have searched for this title and you can imagine my surpise when I found it on this site listing. I had a younger brother, though not handicapped, who I greatly disliked. If I remember, this story has a part in it where the family was so certian that the young brother would not live that they built a coffin for him in his infancy. If I also remember this story correctly, the young boy does die in the end though the details of it I can't now recall. I remember being so stunned by this ending that I began to look on my younger brother as a treasure rather than a liability. You might say that this book changed our relationship. Treasures come in many forms one of them is brothers, even handicapped ones. If you don't want to cry, don't read this book. If you want to look at life a bit differently, buy it and don't put it down."
2,Wishing this was the RIGHT STORY,"Received the mini edition of this book (the large version being difficult to find) for Christmas. The story is completely different from the story we've rented at the library, i'm assuming a ""more"" original version. It seems to have been americanized by Floris Press or whoever it was that decided to re-write this story and put names to all the children and animals and take the beauty out of reading it in verse. If I would have received this book not having read the one we love, I would have just chalked it up to a so-so/boring children's book with pretty illustrations. PLEASE do yourself the favor of finding the actual Children of the Forest book- the story in this one bums me out. I wrote to Nova Natural who is the only retailer I'm aware of that carries the large version, and am awaiting a reply on whether theirs is the correct story..."
4,a winner,Our 6 year old granddaughter LOVED it..Took it to school to share the day after receiving it. A winner! Sweet story line.
3,From Starship Troopers to Red Mars in 1 Page,"The first half of this book (the part spent on Earth) was filled with over the top characters who were completely moronic and unbelievable. This would have been ok if the author was going for something like the movie Starship Troopers (not the books) however, the characters suddenly become more real and believable almost all at once. I suppose this isn't a terrible thing but it showed a bit of confusion on which way to take the book.It wasn't until the last 1/4 of the book that it suddenly got interesting. As interactions with an alien species came in, the book became much more readable and I was hooked until the end. I will give it 3 stars because Bruce Balfour did a proper save face when it mattered and left me with plenty of questions."
1,Lacks Originality,"I did not buy this book, rather, I borrowed it from a workplace ""book swap rack"" and I am glad that I did. The writing is fair enough, but the lack of originality really drains your enthusiasm. Science fiction is a tough medium to write in as most of the truly great ideas have already been explored, but it's not an excuse to re-work works from Philip K Dick (""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep?"", i.e. the movie Total Recall) and Stanley Clarke (""2010, The Year We Make Contact""). Do yourself a favor and read those two books...and skip this one."
1,"Warning, Warning, Stay Away, Don't Waste Your Time","There are only a few books I have given up on before finishing, and this is one of them. Being a fancier of possible life and artifacts on mars, I was drawn to the enticements of the book jacket. Unfortunately, once I began reading I became repelled by the prose, plotting (or is that plodding?) and characters. The writing is pedantic, the people and human situations unbelievable, the science meager, the frame of reference nerdishly undeveloped. I knew that if I persevered, I would only be angry at myself and the author for wasting my time. I must express my gratitude to the other low score reviewers for helping warn me off."
1,Barely worth 1 star,"This book is a real stinker. Written in amateur prose with cardboard characters and a plot that reads like a Saturday morning cartoon. The continuous references to a vast amount of future tech and the ridiculous amount of exposition slows down the first part of the book to the point of pain. Add to that the disjointed nature and many clichés used by the author and you've got yourself a truly childish piece of work. There's far better science fiction out there, don't waste your time with this book."
2,Ho Hum,"Only to be used as very distant background music, if that. A listening peson will realize that this is music made electronically with little human thought or inspiration. It costs little and that is what you get- little effort."
5,relaxation c.d.,"this was bought for a present,so I havent heard it! the receiver was quite pleased with it however."
5,the most important book you'll buy,"This book makes all the difference. Hospital staff don't tell you anything about the system. They don't have the time and they don't want you to know, anyway. The information in here made sure my father had the best care possible. Like the first reviewer said, having it in your hand and on the table in the patient's room changes the care for the better. This book is invaluable. I wore mine out while in the hospital and could quote from it."
5,excellent treatis,Jesus The Christ is an excellent treatise of the Life of Christ. I would recommend it to anyone who id a serious student of Jesus.
3,"This ""illustrated"" version is not on iPad",The book itself is amazing. Kindle for iPad falls short when it comes to links out to references or pictures. IPad users should purchase this from the Deseret Book app. Church book links and pictures work fine on Kindle.
1,Pretentious writing...,"Pretentious writing and dated view point. I mean saying the native americans are cursed... what's up with that? I was stunned to read this. I shudder to think what he would have to say about the African race, or the Chinese, or the Greeks... for that matter, what about the Italians, or the Koreans... Then I realized the book was copywritten around 1915... I guess that was the opinion of the day back then. But nearly a hundred years later, surely no sane person is walking around thinking any physical race is cursed. Are we not all children of God. This is something I would not want my children to read, nor could I in good conscious recommend this to a friend. I can't believe any church would endorse such racist teachings. On a positive note - the author's academic knowledge regarding Christ seems pretty sound. However, I stopped reading at the first racial slur. I wish I could delete this book from my cloud account."
3,IF there's a valid criticism....,"This book, now 'eons' old, has withstood some weathering, but people now are a)considerably more cynical about religion b) wish to form their own opinions regarding things, religion included.Most books by LDS/Mormon leaders are hopelessly biased in-with the myopic POV of Mormonism, and readers not knowing that may not notice some-many of the subtlties. The nature of the Godhead (trinity) will strike many Christians as an example.What also comes thru is the authors adoration of Christ; the gestapo-like tactics / practice of the LDS church in 'enforcing' their beliefs have become Much more pronounced in the years since this book was written...."
5,Most authorative book on the Savior ever written,"I have read the Bible, plus countless other books on Jesus. This is unequivically the most complete, detailed thorough, book on the life, purpose, plan, why's, and wherefores, of Jesus Christ ever written, bar none. I thought I had gained a lot of knowledge about Jesus---until I read this book.Whether Mormon, Catholic, Protestant, or whatever religion you are, PLEASE take time to read this most beautiful book on the life of the Savior I have ever seen. Insight as never has been revealed before. As if the veil between Heaven and Earth has been parted and details revealed that have never been shown to man before.Hint: before beginning, say a sincere prayer, and then read and study where you will not be disturbed. Once you start you will not want to put it down."
5,Absolutely Amazing Book,"The first 70 or 80 pages or so are somewhat difficult to get through, but the rest of the book is absolutely incredible. A must read for anyone wants to understand better the life of Christ."
2,Poor Kindle Adaptation,"Love the book! The problem is in the Kindle adaptation. Yes, it has a linked table of contents, but the links only list the chapter number, not the name or anything else about the chapter, so it is almost useless. There are better Kindle versions of this book, the one I've found to be best is actually free too."
5,Jesus the Christ,This book provides a deep understanding of gospel principles. Having it on my Kindle so I can carry it with me is a real bonus.
5,"How to grill something new, with an Asian twist","If you are bored with steak, hamburger and chicken on the charcoal grill, here are recipes for Bulgogi (Korean Fire Beef), Salmon in Miso Glaze, and many skewered chicken and shrimp dishes that are easy to make, but certainly a different take on grilling. There are a lot of marinades that could be adapted to other items--you can miso-glaze chicken breast, or make flank steak in a number of flavorings. Good little book if you are bored with grilling or want fancy skewered recipes for a party."
5,Corrs at there best and Great quality,"I am a huge Corrs fan, and have every album and DVD they have ever put out. I strongly believe that there first two albums are still the best material they have released. This DVD consists of virtually all songs from those albums as well as one or two which were released afterwards on there later albums. As enjoyable as the Corrs are live in a stadium or arena type atmosphere the 'Unplugged' session shows best of any of the Corrs DVD's there fantastic musical talents and also the best sound of any of the DVD's. The set list is as good as you could hope apart from one or two that were left out. SOund is fantastic, video is fantastic and it is an overall fantastic buy and must have for any fan of great music."
5,CORRS DVD,SAW THEM LIVE ON VH1 LOVED THEM HAD TO HAVE ONE GREAT QUALITY SHOW MUSIC AND SOUND WERE REALLY GREAT
5,The Finest DVD ever !!,"I must have been under a rock for many years.I just recently got into ""The Corrs"". This DVD is an incredible example of fabulous performances by real musicians. The harmony with Sharon and Caroline together is fabulous on ""No Frontiers"" and their solo singing is also outstanding. This album is filled with incredible music. An incredible array of fabulous songs. Check out a few of these on YouTube searching ""Corrs Unplugged"" for ""No Frontiers"" ""Little Wing"" ""Toss the Feathers"" ""Old Town"" and then buy the best DVD ever. Every track is amazing."
5,Excelent !!!,"I've waited for 3 years before it can be for region 1, it is one of the best DVD's from The Corrs, if you are a fan, you must have this."
1,boring.,"why did the corrs do an unplugged session? i mean, they don't play any rock music and they're practically acoustic already. don't get me wrong, i think they're an awesome band but this was stupid. besides, who does unplugged sessions anymore anyway? they're definately not what they used to be."
1,No Book...No Stars!,What's with the price??I've read other things by this author and couldn't wait to explore this book but this price is ridiculous.Hope it changes soon. Don't you want anybody to buy it???**************GLAD TO SEE THERE'S ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS BOOK OUT THERE.SAME AUTHOR.SAME TITLE.BETTER REVIEWS.KEEP LOOKING!
1,On Actors and Typos,"Mr. Lewes book is a gem--he was a keenly-observant Victorian theater-goer whose detailed analysis of the craft of acting is as good as I've ever read. HOWEVER--- this edition of his book, which I assume has long been out-of-print, is unreadable. It has, according to a disclaimer inside the front cover, been produced by robotically scanning an old copy of the book. The disclaimer says there may be ""a few typos"" and some ""missed pages"". (Missed PAGES?) This is an understatement-- the punctuation in this edition is haywire and the spelling is almost as bad (hilariously, in some cases-- on one page Shakespeare is printed ""Quakspere""!). At first I thought I could put up with the errors, but there are so many of them that you get no sense of the flow of Mr. Lewes' thought and no pleasure in the reading. I ended up sending it back. I had purchased this edition with the idea of giving it to an actor friend-- it would have been a very sad gift!"
2,"Good concept, shoddy execution","This could be a really great piece, but the construction quality is incredibly shoddy. The welds are messy, the tile looks cheaply put together. Also, the tile panels don't line up, the pan in the middle is out of round, and it generally looks cheap for a $300 piece of hardware. The one good part, as usual, is Amazon. Quick shipping and great customer service."
3,I've owned this for 3 years,"I have owned this fire pit for three years. It has performed well, but its looks have deteriorated. I have to paint the firescreen cover every year with heat resistant paint. the ceramic pieces are starting to chip. Nice size firepit though. Puts out great heat even underneath when you put your feet near it."
1,Nunca lo recibi,"Este es un gran producto, no supe nunca que paso con el pedido. Obviamenteno puedo recomendar a este vendedor! Pesimala comunicacion."
4,Well written and fascinating,This book cuts past the name-calling and delves into the evidence. Moreover Moerman brings his agile mind to work about the larger ways that meaning creates a physiological response. Great stuff.
2,nothing special,"I thought this book would be very helpful, but it is not. The description is not accurate. The book does not offer anything new, especially for those new to the field, which is pretty ironic."
4,Good value for the money!,Nice looking party tub is great for keeping bottled water or soft drinks cold for our business meetings.
4,"Party tub for ""small"" party","This tub was smaller than I expected but will hold ice and about 12 canned drinks. When we used it for a larger party we actually used this tub for ice and it was great for that with one exception - the tub was placed on a table cloth and it ""sweats"" terribly so if you plan to put it on any surface and you put ice in it please be prepared for that area to become very wet. If not for that I would rate this 5 stars."
2,not happening dude,"I have to say after becoming accustomed by djs and producersthat actually have talent, this cd is old trendy [stuff]. I have tried listening to this cd numerous times after seeing tons of good [comments] but it still just doesn't do it. Go pick up some quality mixes like Frankie Bones' ""You know my name"" or even check out Danny Tenaglia's GU Athens- don't waste your cash"
5,One of the best electronic albums of all time,This album along with Prodigy's Fat of the Land are what I use to compare all other electronic albums to. A masterpiece.
5,Awesome Classic,"I have had this CD for a long time now, and I enjoy it more and more every time I listen to it. I am well versed in different types of electronic music, and this classic is one of the few that gets a constant rotation in my playlist. My favorite by far is ""high roller,"" one of my favorite songs to relax to. Sure, their style isn't as complex as some of the more recent jungle and breakbeat tunes that have come out, but what to you expect from a mid 90's electronica pioneer? This is definately one of my favorite cds of all time."
5,kickin,"from the synthy, dark beginnings of Trip Like I Do to the end of the CD, the Crystal Method delivers an awesome variety of material. Unfortunately for me, I only saw the Gap commercial once. Still need to get me some khakis."
5,"An essential, well made, funky album.","I bought this disc before I'd even heard a track from it, and I wasn't disappointed. The drum-tracks are some of the best I've heard, and it's surprising the sounds they can squeeze out of those synthesizers... You'll also find some well-picked samples, such as the dialogue from the movie `The Dark Crystal' on the epic first track. Highly recommended."
5,The Best Techno Group Ever,"The Crystal Method definitely produce some of the best sounding techno I have ever heard. You have no doubt heard many of their songs in various movies and trailers for movies. Some examples include Vapor Trail in 3000 Miles to Graceland, Roll it Up (off of Tweekend) on countless trailers (Charlie's Angels 2, Confidence, Fast and the Furious, etc), Busy Child from Gone in 60 Seconds, Name of the Game from many commercials, etc. The list goes on and on. If you buy this album or Vegas, chances are you will easily hear 3 songs you recognize and liked but never knew who did them. Also, if you love beats and techno but aren't into the whole Euro-Ecstasy-Dance-Trance type beats, TCM is the band for you. This album was their first and is still by far their best. No regrets for me..."
3,We can dance if we want to,"Well, do you want to try out that new set of subs in your car? Then get this, especially if you don't like electronica much (or think you don't). The beats are powerful and easy to follow--so much so that all your friends won't have to be left behind. Even the most inept of us can follow the groove (hey, I'm not being insulting: I can't dance, that's why I DJ), and even if you're just playing it in your car you can enjoy it to it's fullest. The songs on here can be found on everything from TV to video games because this album approaches mainstream music, but don't let that dissuade you. This album shreads, and so does the Keep Hope Alive Single that you can buy with it. As I developed my taste in electronica, though, it fell out of favor because there is a lot of better stuff out there, but as an entry level techno CD, get this album. Men Without Hats would be proud."
4,Listen to it listen to somthing else then listen again,"Vegas was one of the first techno big beat or what ever you want call it cds i bought. Then I bought Dig your own hole. Then, Richard D. James. Then, well you get the picture. Anyway after hearing all this ""real"" and ""inovative"" techno I still like Vegas. The beats are real the rythems are new and as a whole the album sounds good. Just because they let their music go on one ad doesn't make them like fatboy slim (sell-out). So, to all of you who find fault with this album listen again."
2,Mind-numbingly derivative; passingly tolerable,"The Crystal Method scores about a point out of ten for originality. 'Vegas' is about as groundbreaking as an earthworm on Valium. But, the boys do succeed at creating a wretchedly catchy album. A word of warning though, 'Vegas' seems to have served as a gateway for many into purer forms of electronic music--a move I highly recommend. Once you discover the infinite possibilities available just from techno and trance, 'Vegas' will seem about as played out as any Celine-Mariah-whomever generica. In the Grand Scheme of Things (tm), the Method is a faint blip on the radar best left to ad execs hopelessly trying to sell junk to 18-to-35 year-old males. Oh well, at least commercials are slightly more interesting now."
2,"driving music, not techno","this album lacks what i demand from music nowadays: soul. dimension and most importantly, emotion. the beat patterns are annoyingly similar, just like chemical brothers annoying.don't get me wrong i know what music i like. jungle, trip hop, trance, ambient, etc. this is commercial music meant to milk the hapless public for all the change they can drill outta their pockets.this music s*cks unless you're playing a video game, driving, etc. i can't stand to sit down and listen to it for any extended amount of time.don't buy this unless you like chemical brothers, prodigy, etc. all mainstream commercial ""electronica"".. S*CKS!"
4,"Trip Like I Do, High Roller, Keep Hope Alive","See those songs that make up the title of this review? Download those to see if you'll like this album. I'm a fan of Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, and techno/trance in general.Now you're thinking, ""That's weird, I just read a review that was practical, straight to the point, and completely lacking in useless emotion."" I know. It's sad, isn't it. Review after review of ""I loved it!"" and ""I hated it!"" in too many words. Might as well just look at the overall rating.Like the album? Tell us what's good about it - and not the whole thing. Give us the best songs to start with. Don't like the album? Tell us what you do like so we know whether the opinion is relevent to us.Sorry about the lecture. Enjoy Trip Like I Do (and hopefully the rest of Vegas)."
4,Great and energetic beat,"The music on this disc is great. You can dance and sway to the music. The rhythem is great for any type of workout from aerobics, to dance, standard exercise. Being of the ""Older"" generation, I recommend this to both teenagers and adults. It is very revitalizing."
5,totally awesome,"This album totally rocks! The album is consistently amazing on all of the tracks, some which feature vocals and some which don't. The tracks with vocals are very good, Coming Back feat. Trixie is one of the best songs on the album. But a lot of the songs, while not featuring vocals, featuring interesting vocal loops. For example, on probobly the most commercially succesfull track from this album, Busy Child, the song features a male voice saying ""Get Busy Child."" These vocal riffs are cleverly arranged in order to provide interest to the listerner and to keep the songs going. Overall this album is very catchy, the songs will get stuck in your head, and overall the album rules!"
4,Great music for any listener,"I heard this album during a party and I just had to get it. I've heard Prodigy and DJ Micro and C.M. definitely competes with them. I think track 6 is the ultimate and the different electronic sounds and smooth bass sound phat on any home stereo or car stereo.If you want some of the best of techno, get Crystal Method. You will be hooked and/or dancing in a matter of minutes."
4,america does trip?,"finally some good ol american boys get it right. trippy, hypnotic, samples that are simply infectious. the american answer to orbital. *buy it*"
4,Four Stars,"I know very little about this kind of music, but I do know this, this is awesome! There are a couple of songs here that I skip, but this one is in my cd player at least once a month. Read some of the reviews below for more helpful info on this, like I said, I'm not all that familiar with this style. P.S. if you like this, you'll love ""decksanddrumsandrockandroll"" by Propellerheads, that disc is truly out of this world!"
3,Quite Good Dance Music,"Electronic music isn't my thing, but I like to listen on occasion. I found this album a good one to sample. The hit single ""Busy Child"" follows the predictable formula of (a) thumping bass beat, (b) repeated keyboard/electronic lick, and (c) generic shout-out(s) to be repeated - in this case, ""Get busy time!"" and ""I guess I didn't know"". However, it works well enough that it's a fun listen. Better is ""Coming Back"", probably because for a fuddy-duddy pop fan like myself, it has verses and a chorus (can't tell who the singer is, though). ""Keep Hope Alive"" and ""Vapor Trail"" were also interesting tracks. Generally good stuff, recommended even by non-electronic fans such as myself."
4,tcm vegas,"apparently the crystal method has run out of ideas since their freshman album vegas, because it's undeniably their best work to date. keep hope alive has found it's way into a number of tv ads and films and is a good track to test out your new JL subs and amp. however, comin back's incredibly classy vocals and music make it arguably the best song they've composed. finally it's got one of the tightest cd covers there is."
2,WEAKER OF THE ELECTRIC SUBMISSIONS,"I love the techno-pop sound. None do it as well as the Europeans though. Vegas sounds like they record in someones bedroom. The drums are hollow, the keyboards edgy and cheap...It's hard to turn it up loud enough. It's not real bad - just bad."
4,Sampling Hounds,A bit too much sampling but the beats are cool. I'm coming to these guys after first getting into daft punk last year. Thank you CM for not singing like in some of the DP records. Songs are plenty long (I really like longer songs). This is one I can put on headphones at work and have them almost help me be almost more productive.
5,Legends in the making....,"An addictive combination of Power,speed and energy. This complex music will take 100's of hours to fully appreciate. This album is not about drugs as some people think the techno music culture and artists name implies."
5,Trippy!,"This cd Rules! All the songs are Great! Ignore those people who gave this cd less than 4 stars. If you like Techno, then you'll like this nice blend of: Acid, Breakbeat, and Rave. I think this cd is a little bit better than any chemical brothers cd! It Rules, Buy It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The absolute best hardcore trance techno available legally!,"The Crystal Method, with this CD, has left an imprint on electronica! They have composed pieces of art within the walls of thier musical domain that are made of ambient sounds overlapping hardcore beats and audio wonders. The soundscapes created by the group all contain outlines... plots... storylines almost... that captivate and overwhelm the listener.No electronica Cd to date can compare to this wonder."
5,Outstanding dance and workout album,The best techno album for workouts I have found to-date. Really gets you pumped-up and moving.
1,Descriptions and titles can be misleading,"This is not a real Bruce Lee film. Some people said it was funny, but it is really just horrible. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. The extra cartoon ""Casper"" is probably the best part. If you want real Bruce Lee fighting action, you may have to spend more than $4.99."
3,Here Comes The Beaver,"Unlike me, you have the help of these hilarious reviews to spell it out for you: this is a very uproarious rip-off of Bruce Lee. It's kinda like Shaft and Tiger Lily sitting down to dinner at the Cleaver's. It's so shockingly bad, it's good. I paid a buck for a copy. It was a good price."
2,what is this suppose to be??,"I've dug Bruce Lee for a Real Long time but this Film,Video,Documentary,Bad Acid trip is all over the pace&has no theme whatsoever.Adolph Caesar who is a Good Actor is presenting Bruce but yet they are tying Bruce's Moive&Martial Arts Talent&Genius all at once.Fred Williamson who I think is a Good Actor as well is Casted in here as well but i don't understand what part most actually play here.it's cool when they go back&show what Bruce wanted to do when he was a Kid.the kind of Impact He wanted.but this film is a mess&all over the place for my tastes.Bruce Lee deserved better than this."
2,Only getting 2 stars cause Bruce Lee was in it for a second,"Why someone would want to disrespect The Great Bruce Lee with a garbage movie like this is Beyond me. The only good thing about the film are the old clips of Bruce in some of his movies and interviews, but everything else in the film bring even that down. If you ask me the 4 dollars they are asking is too much."
1,This is not a Bruce Lee movie,"This movie takes place after Bruce Lee's Death. The plot of the movie is that the top martial artists of the world are going to fight for his title. The only catch is that in only shows maybe three fight scenes in the whole movie and none of them are Bruce Lee. It shows Bruce Lee's head a couple times with someone trying to portray his voice. The movie was very low budget, even for its time. I purchased a DVD frisbee for 6.99+s/h. Don't make the same mistake I did."
5,B Movie fans--buy this today!! Bruce Lee fans--don't bother.,"As anyone who's seen Fist of Fear... knows, this is a disgrace to the memory of Bruce Lee. However...In terms of B-movie appeal, this is an 11 out of 10. This expands the boundaries. There should be a C-movie category for this one. I won't go into particulars--a previous review listed most comic elements in the movie.Being an avid fan of the bad movies that tried to be good movies, I cannot stop watching FF/TD. I show it to everyone. I laugh about it all the time. I don't know why this film isn't in a cult film hall of fame--probably too obscure. But one day, it will be, at the top of the list. Trust me.If you love really bad movies, this is a gold mine, a work of art. And for $, how can you go wrong!"
2,MOSTLY A BORING MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE,"THIS FORGETTABLE MARTIAL ARTS FLICK IS ABOUT A HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MATCH AT THE MADISON SQUARE GARDEN THAT'S SUPOPOSED TO DECIDE WHO'LL BE THE SUCCESSOR OF BRUCE LEE. ALL THE FIGHTS ARE CRAP AND THE ACTING IS MOSTLY HORRBLE. AND THERE'S ALMOST NO PLOT AT ALL TO THIS MOVIE. THE ONLY THING THAT SAVES THIS TIME WASTER FROM A ONE STAR RATING IS THE FACT THAT IT HAVES A VERY INTERESTING SEGMENT THAT EXPLAINS BRUCE LEE'S LIFE AND FEATURES FOOTAGE OF BRUCE LEE. OTHER THAN THAT, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE."
1,what a disgrace,"This would have to be one of the biggest loads of crap i have ever seen. It has nothing at all to do with Bruce Lee, its only purpose is to showcase a some martial arts theatrics with aren't anything special. When i first started watching this i thought it was some sort of joke, with the english dubbed interviews - what the ??? What a disgrace to the legend that is Bruce lee. can't believe i wasted $(...) bucks on this pile."
1,Don't watch unless you like being bored,"This movie really makes no sense.Some people fight for title that doesn't exsist.I was ""outraged"" that they got away with the voice overs of Bruce.Some of the fight scenes were O.K.,but the movie is really just a cheap documentary."
3,Bruce Lee's Life Liberal Interpretation,"This is a movie to be viewed once and only once. I tried to watch it twice, but it made me realize how often people take advantage of the pain and suffering of others. I have one copy and I wish to sell it. That's why I'm giving it a 3 out 5.......hoping to sell it soon. It is 90 minutes long and was recorded in EP (slow). Rated R (No one under 17)"
1,Buy this movie only to see a Legend be disgraced.,"This movie has nothing to do with Bruce lee.. This movie often confuses karate with gung fu as well as Japanese culture with chinese. Has no plot and the tounament scenes have no actual fighting. This movie is a total hoax. Buy it if you want to feel pity for the makers. WARNING: There are no facts stated in this movie.. most of the the interview scenes were fake, you can tell from the contrasting video qualities and colors. If you can buy it for 3.00 or lower then buy it just to see how disgusting it is."
3,For Entertainment Purposes Only,"I've read the other reviews bashing this movie/documentry. I was dissing it myself when I first got it,but as I kept watching it,it started to grow on me. This movie should be viewed strictly for it's entertainment appeal,which it has alot,and not for any accuracies on Bruce's life(there are other movies and books for that). The only thing I didn't care for was that the flashback scenes of Bruce as a child actor and the footage of his great grandfather as a warrior,dragged on toooo long. Other than that,it was fun to watch. I also liked the scenes of the Karate tournament at Madison Square Garden. It captured some of the vibe of the ""golden age"" of Karate in the 70's. Again this movie is just for entertainment purposes only."
4,Not bad,i like most of the songs on this dual disc compilation. i am not a fan of live recordings so i was a little disappointed to hear my favorite songs by TWS done live. the only good thing is that the live recordings were done at decent levels. i would buy this album again.
2,Disappointment eith a great subject,"I purchased this DVD with the thought of replacing my VHS versions of same. I expected Joe Garagiola & Vin Scully narrating the 1986 World Series as they did on television and Lindsay Nelson & Curt Gowdy for the 1969 which were the official broadcasters on NBC. I got neither. If you own these World Series classics on VHS, don't discard them for this DVD."
4,Ya Gotta Believe,You'll be happily recapping some of the great moments in Sports history!Lets Go Mets!
3,MLB could have done better,"A longtime Tommie Agee fan from Brooklyn, I finally picked up this DVD title. While I expected the 1969 series section to be based on old television footage, MLB productions could have supplemented the game footage with interviews of those players/coaches/commentators still alive. I forgot that Yogi Berra was the Mets' first base coach during the series. And the way Mark Bellanger would choke up on his bat. The 1986 footage is more disappointing. I would say the 1986 section actually detracts from the actual drama of the games. It is presented so flatly. And where are interviews with Mookie Wilson and Bill Buckner? The soundtrack is also a bit strange as they seemed to used canned stadium sounds instead of the actual sounds of the game."
4,dreaming en ghetto,"Poetry scrapes against the streets...without stopping to stop and wipe the blood away from its knees. For some real boriqua sabor and struggle, pick this up while having dirty hands."
4,Great story collection,"It's been years since I've read this, but the title story still sticks in my mind. I can't tell you too much about it, since that would give away the powerful ending. The balance of the stories are also good, especially the hysterical ""Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod"" (what if William Burroughs instead of Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote Tarzan?). Definitely worth hunting for this collection."
1,Huh? Sounds of nature featuring music by David Miles Huber?,"What is this??? The ""Echoes of Nature"" boxed set doesn't contain natural recordings at all. Instead there are synthesized ""natural sounds"" with music, by ""David Miles Huber"". I'm not sure what Laserlight is trying to pull here, but proceed with caution. What's listed on the box may not be what's inside."
4,relaxing and entertaining,"These 5 CD's can be used to help you relax, or can be used to encourage creativity, or just to give you the feeling that your some place else. The waves could have been more intense, needs more ""boom"" when the waves crash, but otherwise the CD's are very realistic. And the price is excellent! I would recommend these."
4,great value,"I like these 5 CDs very much. The sounds of nature are very relaxing. You get 5 CDs for the price of one. And this is great too.""Morning birds"" is a little dissapointing for me. Compare to others CDs this is not a hole piece but many separated tracks. But overall I would recomend it very highly."
3,Echoes of Nature,"I liked the tapes especially the bird sounds that were actual sounds. However, one of the series has canned music. I would prefer all natural sounds."
5,They're all great! A terrific buy!,"The only problem with this collection is deciding which one to play first! I'm especially fond of the Ocean Waves, Thunderstorm, and Frog Chorus CDs for bedtime. The Songbirds are great in the morning-- their songs really brighten the day. This collection really is wonderful, and a terrific bargain."
2,Not One of Thirkell's Best Efforts,"Angela Thirkell's Barsetshire series includes some of my favorite and most often reread books, but this is not one of them. Many of the characters are ones who appeared in ""Northbridge Rectory,"" and the situations in this book are often rehashes of situations from that book set several years later in time (""Northbridge Rectory"" takes place during World War II, and this book takes place in 1953, when preparations are being made for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation). The committee scenes are copies of the working party scenes from the earlier book, and none of the characters seems to have changed in the least in 10 years. ""Northbridge Rectory"" is much more enjoyable. In my opinion, Angela Thirkell was at her best in the books written in the 1930s through about 1946. The later books just don't come up to that standard."
5,The best album of Robbie,"Oh God.... I only can say one thing about this album... IT'S THE BEST ALBUM.... I put it on my CD Player and I walk in the streets and I when I hear the albun I feel like the life is better, I feel than I can be a Better Man, I feel than I can Let Love can Be my energy, I feel good..."
5,A horror classic!,"No, Bride of Frankenstein did NOT win the academy award for best picture, though it was nominated for best sound...However, it is one of the greatest Universal horror classics of alltime...and surely the best of the 3 original Frankenstein series...It's more fun than the original Frankenstein...the movie itself is a timeless reminder of when Hollywood WAS great...Look at the sets, the costumes, the period pieces...they can't make em as good as they once did...this movie is proof...a 5 star classic!"
4,A Alltime Classic,theres 1 thing i dont like and its the titleThe Bride of Frankenstein.... but it aint hte bride of frankenstein because frankenstein is suppose to be the scientist or whatever u call himif the title wasThe Bride of Frankenstein's Monster then it'd tell the whole thing on what its aboutBut still its 1 of my fav horror films of all time!
5,"""She hate me!""","Director James Whales's sequel to the classic ""Frankenstein"" is even better than the original. The Monster (Boris Karloff) is cast as a more sympathetic creature, longing for peace and friendship in a world that is repulsed by it. Little wonder that so many have seen in it subtextual parallels to Whales's own life as a gay man. Such undercurrents add interest to a film that also works as pure entertainment. Karloff delivers a great performance, his last as the Monster, despite the burdensome makeup. The sets, direction, and photography create a stylistically extreme work of fantasy that is a masterpiece of pure imagination."
2,WHERE WAS THE BRIDE!??!?!,"i saw this movie in my uncle's closet of dvds. so i figured i should watch it, because the bride of frankenstein is my favorite monster of all time.imagine my disappointment when i found out that the title role of this film only appears for three minutes. three minutos, at the most. what a gyp! i was so bugged!the whole movie was [bad] to me, because i was waiting for the bride so long. the only good part was when she first laid eyes on frankenstein, and thinks he's the scariest thing she's ever seen in her three-minute-long existence.a real snoozer. i dont know why so many people adore it. but o yeah, the blind man part was very sweet and it was sad when frankie got chased away."
5,The Bride of Frankenstein,"Well, this is probably my favorite film, bar none.But the transfer is excellent. The extras are a joy.As to the seller- super fast delivery. Highly recommend!"
5,MY LOVE FOR THIS ONE NEVER ENDS IT HAS EVERYTHING,"WHERE DO I START? THIS MOVIE JUST IS A LOVEABLE ENJOYABLE JOURNEY THAT PACKS IT ALL,ANYTIME I CAN CATCH THIS ONE I STOP AND DO JUST THAT BORIS WAS EXTREMELY JUST WONDERFUL!!!! AND THE BRIDE..MAN SHE PLAYED HER PART TO THE EXTREME AND THAT CRAZY DOCOTOR WASNT BAD HIMSELF, SOMEONE MENTIONED THE BRIDE,IT WAS BETTER BUT IT WAS A EXCELLENT REMAKE OF THIS ONE THAT DIDNT LOUSE UP ITS REPUTWA."
5,Greatest Horror Movie,"James Whale will be remembered for centuries because of this fiendishly brilliant piece of Halloweenery. Mixing archtypal emotion with razor wit results in a story far beyond camp and pathos. This film is so brimming with invention that it hardly leaves the viewer time to catch a breath before the next startling scene commences. It's hard to believe there's any horror fan out there that doesn't know this flick by heart, but if you haven't seen it for a while, you owe it to yourself to treat yourself again."
4,Great cast!,"My family really likes horror movies like Frankestein but I could never stand them, well I was practically sucked into this one. In many ways it is a sad movie, as is the first one. Elsa Lanchester is a great actress and Boris Karloff does a superb job. The only movie I've seen that I like him better in is ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Do not watch this movie if you want a good night's sleep, because that is one thing you won't get. I just can't decide on a rating, so I gave it four stars, had to pick something."
5,"If I could read only one more novel, I'd re-read Delirium.","Delirium of the Brave is one of the finest novels I have read. It has all the right ingredients of a perfect novel. It's literary; the characters are engaging and there is suspense, romance and multiple layers of conflict.I've never cared much about the Civil War or the South. When I started reading Delirium, that part of our history came alive.It's truly amazing that a Georgia podiatrist can create such beautiful fiction. I'll bet all the MFA's from Creative Writing mills are eating their hearts out.I eagerly await the next novel by Dr. Harris and if I ever get a hangnail, I'm heading for Savannah."
3,This is good fun. Real good.,"I know the author and was wondering why he thought he could write a novel. Then I read the book and was truly surprised, and wonderfully so. I thought he'd read a little too much Michener...he told me he never had. There's lots of Catholic guilt in here."
4,Great Read! Kept me hooked from the start.,"I really enjoyed this book, I hope Mr. Harris does a repeat performance. His characters are great and their inter relationships a so plausible! A great summer read!"
1,A very bad book,"Every southern cliche is here, from happy slaves to decadent aristocrats, all rendered in a style so wooden and lifeless it's amazing that anyone can get through the book, much less love it. This may be the worst writing I've ever read. A completely fraudulent book from the publisher that brought us another great book for our time: MONICA'S STORY."
2,A Great Story,"THis was a really good read! It kept moving and had great action, too. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Savannah."
5,"exquisite; emotional, heartfelt","Folks are comparing Whiskeytown to the ""new country"" genre, or the ""NO Depression"" genre (a name lifted from an Uncle Tupelo album--referring, broadly, to a band which acknowledges country and bluegrass roots while staying aware of contemporary pop and punk, leaving behind the cowboy hat cliches of the Garth Brooks oeurve). Let's forget labels for a minute: Whiskeytown's ""Stranger's Almanac"" is a collection of finely written American songs. Many of them are instantly hummable because their melodies are damned infecutuous, their performance is seamless, the lyrics are integrated with melody, and their playing is as tight anything the Glimmer Twins might have taken months to produce. Just listen, once. You'll see."
4,Heartbreak in widescreen,"The soaring steel guitar figure which opens ""Excuse Me If I Break My Own Heart Tonight"" is THE definitive alt.country riff of all time--for me, anyway. It doesn't get any better than this song. Desperation, awe, anguish, love, and a resolve to communicate to the other person that what they're doing is a tremendous mistake--all delivered in the form of a song that, musically, sweeps you up, propells you along, and makes you catch your breath. A fully realized vision. The rest of the album's pretty great, too."
5,One for all the broken-hearted,"Boy, are the situations described in this classic LP familiar or what? Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart doesn't need much explanation and it sets the tone for the whole album with typically insightful song-writing. Personal favourites are Turn Around, Losering and the killer closer, but there's a veritable gold mine of heart-rending beauty to be plundered here. Ryan Adams has an amazing voice and its hard to listen to him without misting up, he's that effective. Even when sober! The brother has been there, in the darkest hours of the soul, and lived to tell the tale. The band bring these amazing songs to life and every note is struck with honesty and precision. It's an alt-country classic all the way and anyone who digs Tupelo (particularly Anodyne); Wilco (Being There), Freakwater (End Time; Feels Like..) and the rest should definitely own it. Buy and cry."
5,As comfy as your ratty old college sweatshirt,"I wasn't born and bred into an alt-country state of mind. In fact, my blood runneth deep with English punk, ska, and SoCo power pop. However, life led me to the south and, for reasons unbeknownst to me, I begin to notice the local musical culture slowly seeping into my system. I fought it as first...until I heard ""Turn Around"" on the local college station. The gravely ""I just woke up and need coffee"" vocals and cloudy day musical arrangement struck a chord in me that has yet to leave even though I have moved on and out of the southland. From the down home twang of ""Excuse me while I break..."" to the simple, sweet words of a lover's longing in ""Avenues"", this cd has the capacity of scaling one's daily emotional gamut with honesty, humor and depth."
3,WELL WORTH THE WAIT,"A FRIEND OF MINE SENT ME A COPY OF ""STRANGERS ALMANAC"" A FEW DAYS AGO. JUST ONE LISTEN TO ""BREAK MY OWN HEART TONITE"" AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY. I HEARD STEVE EARLE/GRAM PARSONS/EAGLES IN A LOVELY MIX OF AMERICANA AND LOVE AND LOSS. BUT WE SHOULDNT COMPARE THEM TO OTHERS BEFORE THEM. JUST ENJOY THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE AND FOR WHAT THEY SOUND LIKE. IM SORRY I WAITED SO LONG TO HEAR THEM. THANKS TO BTO FOR TURNING ME ON TO THEIR SOUND."
4,Lot's of Fond Memories,I haven't listened to Michael Card in a long time. It was great to hear these songs again as they were quite meaningful to my wife and I at that time in our lives. Michael has a wonderfully artistic and creative way of telling the Biblical story.
3,Biography - Thomas A. Edison: Father of Invention,Thomas Edison was know as a sadistic animal killer. He would steal his neighbors pets and farm animals to shock them to death. Thomas Edison was a vicious sadist. He made a public spectacle of electrocuting an innocent elephant.This is not a man to be in awe of!
5,Right on time,Item came in on time. This is the 7th time I have ordered this book. I give it to as a gift to our foreign exchange students that live with us to learn English.
5,A sad goodbye,"Since I graduated from reading Nancy Drew mysteries in grade four I've been reading the Warlock books. I started with the first book and never looked back. Rod, Gwen, their children, as well as Fess have been freinds and now I can't expect to hear (well, read) of their new adventures.So its a fond and sad farewell for me.Mr. Stasheff brings together all the threads of his many tales over the years with skill. After so long you'd expect there to be more inconsistencies in this last book from the first. Unlike many other authors, he managed to avoid the mistakes that readers always catch. Especially after such a long lived series.A wonderful final adventure as Rod and Fess go off in to the sunset and find Gwen again."
5,Perfect!,"Very simple, very solid. It holds about 15 utensils. I couldn't believe that I paid only $10 for this."
5,Fabulous product at a great price,"I am so impressed with this utensil holder. It is much larger, and heavier, than I thought it would be. Just perfect for fitting quite a few spatulas, long spoons, a sieve and other items I want handy on my counter. In fact, it is such a quality item that I am ordering another one today. You need this type item to help you get organized. If you like to do a lot of cooking you do not want to have the utensils stuck away in a drawer. Have everything out in easy reach. This stylish holder will do its part."
3,"functional, but some big dents","I just received my utensil holder today. Its perfectly functional, but there are some big dents around the bottom and some scratches. I doubt this happened during shipping, given how heavy the material is and how well it was packed... which means amazon sent it out in bad condition. Disappointing, but not really worth the time and hassle of a return (given that this thing serves a utilitarian, not aesthetic purpose).If you're looking for something functional to keep in your kitchen, this is a good purchase. If you are looking for something pretty to match your other stainless steel items... look elsewhere!"
2,After a year,"After almost a year, it looked beat up and had spots on the outside. I think I would go for something glass or ceramic next time."
3,Stainless Steel Utensil Holder .,"Very nice , very solid , and very well priced .I'm impressed that it got damaged in shipping .They must have really tried hard to crush them in shipping as well as it was packed and as solid as they were built .I would highly recommend and yours should come in undamaged .Again ... Very nice just shipped by monkey's with steam rollers ."
2,Did I get the wrong thing?,"After reading the reviews here and seeing that fabulous picture I ordered one of these. Unfortunately, when it arrived it didn't look like the picture or measure up to what people said about it in the reviews. First, the one I got does not have a brushed exterior. I has a very shiny exterior, which shows a considerable number of small surface imperfections, mostly small pits in the surface, but a few others as well. It's going back to Amazon because it won't find any love in my kitchen.Note: This thing is made in India, which is worse in my opinion than having it made in China.I submitted some pictures so you can see that I saw."
3,Not Brushed Stainless Steel,This product works well and is inexpensive. But it's not brushed stainless steel like the description stated. It has a very shiny finish. Otherwise it's a great bargin.
1,no hay razón,"No hay razón, como están las cosas en el mundo financiero y editorial actualmente, para que la publicación en Argentina de la maravillosa obra de una excelsa venezolana como Conny Mendez, CUESTE UN 40% MÁS que la publicada en Venezuela. Por el contrario, debería costar MENOS... muchísimo menos! De allí que le dé este review.Y no es por los derechos de autor que hay que pagar, ya que Conny Méndez desencarnó hace más de 25 años. Alguien está lucrando de más con la sed espiritual de los hispanoparlantes."
3,This was a gift for someone who didn't receave it for 8 weeks.,it was a gift and I haven't heard from the receiver I don't even know if she received it. every time I ask the answer is no not yet. So really I shouldn't even review just that I want to get the review out of the way. I guess it is the post office fault and has nothing to do with the book. but people should know upgrade how it is sent or it will take 8 weeks.
2,Complicated,"This is too complicated for most people to understand. If I needed a textbook, which this obviously is, I would still not buy this one. Much too convoluted."
3,Missing in Translation?,"There's something missing in translation of the humor. The movie isn't all that funny. It also seems a bit overproduced for what it is. Daniel Auteuil is still a great actor but the others aren't that sweet or attractive. I still liked it a little, but not that much. There was something missing from the humor."
3,I'm a fan of Daniel Auteuil but...,"This movie just didn't do it for me. It was painful to watch scenes with Louis (Jose Garcia) at times. His potrayal of a hopeless man while good, gets on your nerves after a while. Antoine (Daniel Auteuil) is unbelievably kind and compassionate so much so that it gets annoying to watch him screw up his own life. Annoying isn't funny."
3,Not nearly as funny as it could be but hard to dislike,"Daniel Auteuil plays the friend in need in Apres Vous as a maitre`d who tries to get would-be suicide José Garcia back on his feet only to fall for the girl the poor sap tried to kill himself over, Sandrine Kiberlaine, and start to ruin his own life in the process. Despite the strong cast and glossy production values, the material never quite justifies all the expense. It's fairly gentle stuff with few really big laughs but hard to dislike even though it doesn't make the most of the opportunities the premise presents, and the scene with Garcia's grandmother (André Tainsy) is a gem.While the unsubtitled French PAL DVD has decent extras, Paramount's extras-free NTSC disc comes with only a subtitled widescreen transfer to recommend it."
3,"Porn, everyday?","""Trucks - It's just porn mum"" is one of the freshest songs to hit the charts and in between the melodic sound of the song is a fragment of truth. Everyday -if you look carefully- you will see ""porn"" in some form everywhere you look. Whether it be a magazine, commercial, songs, games and even on the streets of everyday life. Goldfinger - Open your eyes is a similiar song which asks you to take a look around, of course ""Open your eyes"" didn't ask you to look for porn. Now look outside your window and tell me, do you see any porn?The song is good -as many others are- and if you like this song I stongly suggest that you purchase the single -not merely download it.The world has changed from generation to generation and there is more to see, even outside that window. Take a look! Do you see the porn?"
5,Fun for reader & readee...,"My nearly 2 year old daughter has us read this to her over and over. Last week at a restaurant she spontaneously started reciting ""Peanut Peg & Peanut Pete"". It's fun to read cover to cover or just a few. And I can see her reading it for many years to come.Definitely a good addition to your child's library."
2,Sucked and not in a good way,"Wow. I thought (mistakenly) that this could be good campy humor, needless nudity and a decent burn of 2 hours. Couldnt get past the first 30 minutes. Maybe if I was a 14 year old I would find it great. WARNING: if you are over the age of 18, beware, this movie sucks...and not in a good way."
2,This isn't what you think!,"BEWARE! This is NOT the original Rhino compilation, which was wonderful and is currently Out of Print. This is a repackaged version which contains some of the original material, HOWEVER... apparently Rod McKuen liked it so much, he decided to redistribute it replacing his own versions of MANY of the songs! Now, if you like Rod McKuen, this set is for YOU! Personally, I am not THAT fond of the man or his voice, and I'm REALLY annoyed that he replaced Anthony Newley's rendition of Johnny Mercer's ""This time the dream's on me"" with his own. It's hard enough to find recordings of Newley without this sort of sacrilege. I won't even go into the other horrors of this CD. Suffice it to say, go for the original Rhino compilation. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!"
5,Great Product,"I found this product through the company website. I have a son with Asperger's and chronic GI problems. There was a recomendation on the DAN website for a certain amount of EFAs. I found that most store products weren't coming anywhere close to the percentages per dose that the doctors were recommending. I went online and found this. Per teaspoon dose, you can't get a bigger percentage which means only one teaspoon instead of half a bottle. My son has been on it for nearly a year and is doing much better. This has definately been part of the healing process for him although for Autism Spectrum Disorders, there are no one cure wonders. It is made from flax seed oil, so if your child is allergic to flax, you might want to try fish oils instead."
2,Too Strong,"I regret to say that this product by Childlife, in particular is too strong. I purchased this product for my toddler and eight year old son who couldn't stand it. I tried it out for myself, and ended up tossing it in the trash. Granted, some might actually take well to it, just like the previous reviewer. However, we weren't one of the lucky ones."
3,Nice but messy,"This is a great product. My son will take it in his juice just fine, however, it is messy. The oil will drip down the sides when replacing the lid."
2,Check the drawers,This book is not very informative. It is easier to look in you wife's drawer and see what size lingerie she wears. Then use your imagination to see what she would look like when you are at the lingerie store.
2,"Decent, but not great","This set is basically a rehash of prior NatGeo documentaries. I had seen some of these before, such as Relentless Enemies and Kingdom of the Blue Whale. While good, they're not great - and certainly not up to the groundbreaking standards set byPlanet Earthand the folks at BBC. They tend to provide overly dramatic storylines for the animals and focus far too much on the human researchers. The fact that this is mixed with with documentaries on things ranging from astronomy and sports makes it difficult to recommend this set as a gift for anybody, except perhaps a diehard NatGeo junkie."
4,But it is not suppose to be Planet Earth,"It is hard to compare this set of documentaries to Planet Earth because the film makers did not intend for these films to be another or type of Planet Earth. They did not have the time or funds to create a look at the entire world that Planet Earth does and I doubt they wanted their pictures to be compared to Planet Earth. Instead we have here a classic cross section of National Geographic documentaries with superb picture and sound that should thrill any family to own. Some inclusions weaker than others, this is a great set on blu-ray for less than $10 a film."
2,TRASH,Sounds as though it were recorded at a fifty-cent keggar. Lousy selecton of songs. Sounds like she was beat.
3,TRACK LISTING - 14 SONGS:,Tracks:1. Can You Hear Me2. Glorify You3. Tiny Baby4. Alexis' Song5. I Need You Now6. God Is All7. God Is Here8. We Don't Pay For Love9. Maybe An Angel10. I Am Found11. Live The Faith12. Take Me God13. Communion Thoughts14. This Was A Dream
5,Classic B&W adventure film,"Cary Cooper does a restrained slow burn as an independently-minded but highly capable colonial soldier, stationed in the remote, volatile edges of the far-flung and perpetually shaky British empire. The locale is the rugged, untameable mountain terrain of Kashmir and Afghanistan, where local warlords and would-be kings wreck havoc with the disciplined, top-heavy imperial armies. Sound familiar? Yeah, I thought it might. Anyway, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, good old-fashioned, black-and-white adventure flick, which includes a few interesting character studies inside the barracks walls. Franchot Tone is particularly appealing as the tart-tounged newcomer who antagonizes Cooper, but inevitably becomes his best friend and comrade in arms. Recommended!"
5,"Must read for every doctor, or doctor in training","This book is quite dated, but the essence still rings true. Takes a humorous look at how doctors are trained and how the specialties differ. Could be thought of as a text version of the show ""scrubs""."
2,"Great movie, poor dvd!!!!!!!!!","My review is for the 2010 Echo Bridge release of Trancers. Trancers is a great 80's sci-fi classic about a cop from the future, Jack Deth being transported back to the 1980's to stop Whistler from wipping out the members of the counsel (from Deth & Whistler's own time). Whistler uses the body to one of his ancestors to ""trance"" people to do his bidding. Trancers themselves have a yellowish zombie type look. Trancers is just a fun campy 80's flick. I give the movie itself 5 stars, but the dvd version stinks! The picture itself if blurry, as if it was out of focus, and of the course the famous bar scene where the picture goes black for a few seconds. If you still have a vcr I'd suggest purchasing this on a vhs tape until a decent dvd release appears, that's what I did."
4,TRANCERS,A classic Tim Thomerson Sci-Fi film from the 80's. Also in this movie has a very young Linda Hunt.
3,Guilty Pleasure,"Well, maybe not too guilty about it, I do like Trancers. Tim Thomerson does a good job of playing the hard boiled, wise cracking detective. Trancers, like the many of the movies from New Moon were low budget, cheesy but very enjoyable to watch. Mr Thomerson did a good job in all of them."
2,Major B-type sci fi,"Wow - a real B-movie...or perhaps a C or D. Awful sound track too. Sort of reminds me of the first Terminator movie in terms of style with worse special effects...Terminator I enjoyed, this not so much. The general concept is interesting but pretty poorly produced IMO. The only real positive in this movie is Helen Hunt.Others may like it. I can see where it may have a cult following. In fact it has spawned 5 additional movies....don't ask me how!"
4,Full Moon Great,Great movie to see but see this one to understand the story better than watching the second first. lol I was hooked by the second and wanted to see the first. Great sci-fi movie to see
4,Wild,"This is the most original, stylish movie I've ever seen. Too bad it's low budget. Thomerson is the best"
1,Whaaaat?,"The only purpose of this review is to describe the picture and sound quality of this release. Both the image and sound behave as though the film was transferred directly from an overused VHS tape. It's very difficult to accept that for ten bucks this DVD looks and sounds this bad. Trust me, I'm not exaggerating in the least. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! DON'T BUY THIS DVD."
1,Very Poor Quality on Amazon Streaming,"I'm sure ""Trancers"" is a 4 or 5 star film. However,I believe you will need to get the DVD,rather than instant streaming or download.As delivered by Amazon streaming it is nearly unwatchable due to a faint double image on each character,as well as a general ""fuzziness"" of all objects with a slight color ""halo"".I realize that it is poor form to comment on technical matters rather than the film quality. However..there is a rapidly expanding market at Amazon for streaming and downloading films. I have used both methods on Amazon Prime;approximately 10 films/week, for more than a year-without problems. This movie (or the copy being streamed) is unacceptable.Regardless of the merits of ""Trancers"" itself,it is unwatchable as a digital download-regardless of hardware/video card, ISP connection,bandwidth,or line quality."
4,Jack Deth is Back...and He's Never Even Been Here Before!,"TRANCERS is the first in a 5 movie series (thus far)that deals with time travel, mind control, and a cop with attitude...Jack Deth. Jack's mission is to hunt down and destroy the member's of a psychic cult of ""zombie-like"" creatures called TRANCERS. The movie takes place in 2247 and in 1985 with Jack Deth going back in time to destoy the evil Trancers.This movie is filled with action and some pretty good drama, but is not a big budgited movie. If you enjoy time-travel, sci-fi and action you would enjoy this film. It also stars Helen Hunt in the early days of her acting profession as Lena, Jack's friend and co ""Trancer-hunter""."
2,Miscast,"The the acting was marginal, and the effects were weak. But, the story was interesting enough and the pacing was fast and maintained throughout. I believe that Tomerson was miscast as the hero and there was little chemistry between the leads. Overall, not a total waste of a rental fee."
1,An angry violent renegade that will stop at nothing for revenge!,"The headline is a description of how I felt after watching this junky film. I want revenge for the time it took from me. I can enjoy a good bad movie, but this is just bad. I can see what folks liked about it, what it is trying to be, but it ain't it. If you liked ""They Live"", you should stay away from this film. ""They Live"" was fun and cheesy at times, but well done. This is just a crappy movie in which they started with a VHS copy, transferred it to Laserdisc, and then transferred it to DVD. My one star is for the enjoyably bad score and the club scene with punk band playing a hilarious ""Jingle Bells"". Oh, the girl who plays Deth's boss in the past was entertaining."
3,"Great film, shame about the transfer","Look, this is one of the great cult flicks of the nineteen eighties. I saw it in cinema screenings in the UK when it was first released. You really can't tell me that the best the manufacturers of this disc can manage is a z-grade video to disc transfer."
4,Like this alot.,The feel of this cut was very relaxing. I injoyed the way the flut was introduces and worked with the strings.
3,Always worth looking if Newman's in it...,"After only five movies in the '90s, this is Paul Newman's first movie of the new decade. This week Mr. Newman is turning 76 years old. Hard to believe considering how sharp and lively his performance here is.The movie itself is moderately entertaining, but I think the problem with it lies in the script. I won't reveal plot details, but I will say that there are a number of plot turns that are just a little too convenient to be convincing. What makes this worth a rental is Newman's easy-going performance. Linda Fiorentino turns in a solid performance-- she too is above the material.As I said in the review title, I think just about anything Newman does these days is worth checking out."
2,DVD is flawed,This disc is scratched or flawed and pauses/skips in three different places. I was very disappointed in the quality of the product.
2,"Less funk, more folk","Jacob Berendes (_Ordem E Progresso_) goes for a more folky, acoustic-guitar style in this, his second album. While it lacks some of the electronic-audio-collage flair of his previous album, Berendes' absurdist sense remains well in evidence and he even reveals a bit more of a personal, sensitive side."
3,1/2 skippy,great videos but one of the dvds skipped which was distracting.requested a replacement but it just was not worth the trouble of returning the complete package.
2,Well Priced.,"I, on the other hand, found this album to be not-too-helpful. I AM a harsh grader, but The Best Of the Bird is made up of un-labeled takes at clubs. In other words: THIS IS NOT IN THE OMNIBOOK. For Improvers looking for bird to learn from, find another. If you don't care about that, and just want a cheap CD of the Genius of Parker, get it. It's 5 bucks."
3,nothing special..,There are only 4 songs on here... 2 can be found on the Vegas cd.. and 1 is just a radio edit.. the other... a mix of Busy Child.. isn't all that spectacular.. but you might end up liking it.. *shrugs* members.xoom.com/SkyDreams/cmindex.htm ~Crystal Dreams~
3,Can someone explain?,"I am considering this product, but have reservations about why (or if) it will work. Vehicles since 1974 have catalytic converters that convert the carbon monoxide exhaust emmissions to carbon dioxide.Now if this kit was designed to attach to a LAWN MOWER, I would have already bought it.Any thoughts here?"
1,Didn't work for me,I'm in northern California and have a winter vegetable garden going. Found an active gopher tunnel in my vegetable garden bed where I'd been losing vegetables for several weeks. Ran exhaust down the tunnel as instructed for over 30 minutes. Pulled the hose and opened up the tunnel. Within 20 minutes the gopher had plugged it back up. Tried it on two other holes and they also were plugged back up within an hour.
1,Does not fit Toyota Mini Van and Don't use with dual exhaust Systems,"This thing does not fit on my 2004 Toyota Mini Van. Tried to make it work using a filler material but it only leaked and/or blew off once pressure built up. Also, note that if you try to use this on a vehicle that has two exhaust pipes, I don't think you will be able to build up adequate pressure. Too bad... I really thought it was a great idea and could work if it only truly was one size fits all!"
2,It was a total failure.,After repeated attempts over two weeks with different lengths of hoses the product was a total failure. The gopher still persists. It was a waste of time and gas.
1,not effective,"First of all the lack of instructions was a factor. I ""gassed"" 4 different areas for 20 minutes each. Within 2 days the mounds and tunnels were back. This could be operator error as there were no instructions as to what length of hose to use."
1,overboard exaggerator,"I bought one of these things to get rid of the smart gophers who wouldn't fall for the Black Hole. Since it had rained a lot, I waited a month or so to try it and I found the device is too large for each of my four vehicles and thus, is useless. The product is still in mint condition but since it was more than 30 days, there's no returns and I'm screwed and the gophers still live long and prosper. Then again, last nite, I set five Black Holes and bumped off three gophers. One size does not fit all..."
2,Don't think it worked,"Got this device to get rid of voles I had ruing my yard. They were living under the sidewalk and thought this would work great. For starters any car with a chrome muffler tip may require you to remove it, as I had to for the device to fit on the muffler. Also I have a dual exhaust so I'm not quite sure that enough exhaust fumes were going through the hose as the fume smell was not that strong. Let it run for 15min and filled in the holes. The next moring I saw one of the holes was dug back out so I don't think it worked. Maybe not ment for my car (2007 honda accord)."
5,Black Cross,"Greg Iles is always at his best even in Black Cross, a novel about WWII! This was excellent as his writing always is. He draws you in very quickly!"
5,Real page turner,"Greg Iles is one of my favorite authors. I've read several of his novels, which I've selected based on reader's ratings and reviews. I was always leery of reading this book, because its subject matter and time period were so different from most of his other novels. But, I like the author, and I needed another good book to read. Well, I wasn't disappointed! I seemed to start slowly, and I wasn't sure where it was heading. So, it made me wonder. But then soon enough, it took off. It really caught my interest to the point that I couldn't put it down until I got to the end. It had all of the excitement and intrigue that I hoped for. Great read!"
5,A page turner,A very compelling read. My wife and I both read it and loved it. We picked up another novel by Mr. Iles and are looking forward to it.It is definetely worth your time.
2,Too much for me,"I really like Greg Iles' books, but this one was way too graphic for me. The very specific and lengthy concentration camp scenes and descriptions are not something that I can read. I have great sorrow and empathy for the cruelty, but I just can't read the details of it."
2,NOT the same calibre as other Iles texts despite glowing recs,"I grabbed this book with excitement, after reading some stellar reviews, thinking that it was of the same calibre as other Greg Iles books I've read. I am disappointed! The historical/WWII intrigue was fun, but the story lacked the complexity and depth of his other books. Moreover, the storyline was very predictable and typical for WW2 thrillers. I would NOT recommend the book to first-time Iles readers, nor to Iles fans."
3,Compelling story of an almost bungled mission,This book almost wove a bit of political intrigue into an action story. The story was based on a mission which was to be completed by two unlikely people. Everything works out OK in the end though.
3,Truth to be Told...,"I saw an interview with Ray Bradbury years ago where he expressed his complete disdain for this adaption. He said if you wanted to conquer America you'd show THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES and THE WINDS OF WAR back to back and put the entire nation to sleep. Frankly, I think old Ray was alittle harsh. While this adaption does leave something to be desired, it is an entertaining five hours. Rock Hudson's character was made up for the tv production and not in the book. He exists to act as a bridge to all the different segments of the story."
3,Was awesome when i was a kid,"Saw this when i was much younger it was fascinating back then , was all excited to re-live a piece of childhood when i got this show , but it was so amazingly boring that i couldn't even get past about 30 minutes and it's not a matter of special effects being dated, i still watch and love the original 80's V, this is just very dull, must have been hopped up on Pepsi as a kid to sit through this and not fall asleep!"
2,Pretty dull,"Not good, not terrible. It's pretty consistenly boring, badly acted, poorly written and generally low budget, but I can see how it could hold some appeal for genre fans."
4,Good DVD,I had seen this mini-series when it first hit TV and had liked it then. My only complain is not have having it in stereo. Would have added to it.
4,Long but good,I remember when this first came out and as a movie spread out over serveral nights - it sucked. But watching it all at one time. Worth buying.
1,Shame,"I really looked forward to watching this - having been a great admirer of Bradbury for many years. But ""The Martian Chronicles"" is a complete waste of time and money. Some of the stories used to make the movie can also be seen in the ""The Ray Bradbury Theater"" series, though in a much better version. The chronicles were obviously made with a very low budget - the acting is pathetic and the casting of Rock Hudson a blundering mistake. Thats five hours I will never get back."
1,que intento tan fallido,"Desilusionate producción a una obra maestra del pensamiento contemporáneo.Versión muy pobremente producida, y tristemente actuada, que se queda a años luz de la obra maestra de Ray Bradbury.Imágenes pobres, ambientaciones gratuitas, actuaciones verdaderamente mediocres, interpretaciones prejuiciosas...en fin, mejor me quedo con la lectura del libro y con mis propias interpretaciones a la obra original."
2,"Great book, Horrible Show","I have students watch this video after reading the book to write a compare/contrast paper. Students generally have a great time slamming the series on all levels. The vital important symbolisms and parallels to immigration and western expansion are missing in this series. I can dissect this series all day, but it comes down to watch the series (with fast forward button on your remote ready in hand) for a laugh after reading the book. I think it is worth buying if you can get it under 10 bucks. PS (if you think you are going to watch this in lieu of reading the book, your mistaken, you will flunk your tests)."
1,Martian Chronicles,"I purchased these tapes for my 6th grade reading class as they are reading the book,and they are so dated that my kids laughed through the whole first part. I'm sure they were cutting edge back in 1980 but the sci-fi effects are laughable. You can almost see the string on the ""space ships"". The acting is like 1950 - stilted and affected. They pronounce Mars as ""Maaahhhhs"". They don't capture the whole book, just parts of it and it was S-L-O-W going. They are back in the cases and ready to be put on Ebay. Horrible....wasted my money, but I should have known a 1980 made-of-tv would be awful. Live and learn."
1,The Martion Chronicles,"The service and packaging was good, however the contint was not, this movie has 3 disc the third and final disc was no viewable. it skips and sticks.I was very disappointed in the quality if the copies that I recieved."
1,Awful!,"As a reader who appreciates Bradbury stories, I was severely disappaointed in this ""adaptation"". Awful acting, awful sets, awful directing, and awful awful, awful adaptation that does not come close doing any part of the original story justice.It's not even the good kind kind of awful where you can laugh at the awfulness (like Plan 9). I found the expansion of Rock Hudson's role irritating and distracting. As many readers have noted, it is dog slow. During the Father S and P segment, I actually fast forwarded through 15 minutes of plodding dialog.My prayer is that all copies of this awful movie will vanish like a dying Martian civilization."
5,Hard to find good Sci Fi,Castle Rock entertainment produced this in VHS and left out the final episode. It took the USA for me to get the complete version on DVD.
3,Better than nothing,"The Martian Chronicles is an average mini-series of the era it was filmed; it doesn't hold up well, but Darren McGavin's role makes it worth watching. And it is interesting to see Rock Hudson."
5,martian cronicles,I saw this on TV & wanted a copyI loved it and recommend it to any sci fi collectorThe photography was beautiful!!!interesting story
2,Parts of This Film Are True To a Great Book,"The Martian Chronicles is one of my favorite books. This made-for-TV movie is one of the only film adaptations I'm aware of. Staring Rock Hudson, the film has a fairly good cast. Not heavy on special effects, the set design is outstanding in representing Martian design and architecture. You simply feel like the sets potrayed could have been the remains of a past civilization.Despite the book being rather short, the screen play writers felt they had some better ideas to offer, which doesn't really hold true. The first chapter----The Explorations, holds pretty true to the book, but then drfts a bit. But the first hour or so do make this worth watching and the newly created scenes have some value in and of themselves."
4,The Martian Chronicles,"I've been a fan of Ray Bradbury and The Martian Chronicles and only saw this ""made for TV"" program when it first aired. Since the movie was shot for TV it doesn't have the production value of a theatrical movie or HD, but it was a pleasure to see the entire movie without interruptions. The movie is a good representation of the book and will make a great addition to a ""true"" Sci-Fi collection."
4,"Kinda campy and fun, but takes itself way too seriously","I remember watching this on TV when I was a young teenager. I remember having a nightmare about some of the early scenes, but always remained fascinated and wanted to watch it again. Well after watching the DVD I came away laughing. It's kind of like the original Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek meets Fantasy Island, with a little Love Boat tossed in. It's worth getting just to see Rock Hudson's melodramatic performance. I enjoyed it."
2,Even Bradbury has to wince a little...,Even the illustrious writer himself (whom I consider one of the greatest short story writers of the 20th century) would have to wince seeing this production. Poor Rock Hudson seems to be trying as hard as he can to lend what credibility he can to the terrible script. This is an excellent demonstration of how far the quality of television productions have come since 1980.
5,Excellent in every respect,"This made for television mini-series despite being filmed on a limited budget is excellent in every respect. Rock Hudson, Darren McGavin, and Barry Morse are particularly effective in presenting Ray Bradbury's thoughtful vision to the small screen."
4,The Martian Chronicles,I've owned this movie since it was first released on tape. Finally got around to buying it on DVD. This movie is part of SciFi movie history
3,Good but uneven.,"""The Martian Chronicles"" is an old favorite of mine. This production is artistic and thoughtful, but sacrifices plot and storyline for these goals. The first few episodes are pretty good, but the center episode, in which MINOR SPOILER a Martian involuntarily becomes whatever the Earth person wants him to be, is slow and depressing. The special effects in this piece are nothing much, but it is fine for all that. Rock Hudson probably was not the best choice for Colonel Wilder, but he does not do badly. The rest of the cast is actually better.The beginning and ending of this miniseries are the best parts. The viewer who slogs through the slow center portion will be rewarded. RJB."
5,Great series,"The quality of the DVD is very good. Long story, but it moves along well. A lot better than most TV series that were put out in the 70's. A must for Ray Bradbury fans."
4,Its Okay,It was alright having not seen it for many years i enjoyed watching it and am glad for the purchase
3,The World of Steam takes flight,"In the 1950s, the US government studied the feasibility of building nuclear powered bomber aircraft, before deciding that the (substantial) drawbacks outweighted the (small) benefits. The author of this book worked on one such study, and imagines what might have happened if such aircraft had been built, to wait almost forgotten until a peculiar set of circumstances brought them into the air.If you are interested in the technology of nuclear powered aeroplanes - big, dangerous behemoths that they are - then this book, which carefully covers the pros and cons, is worth a look. If not, don't bother. The aircraft itself was the only thing that held my interest; the plot and characters were too contrived and unlikely for my tastes."
2,posture chair - back pain relief!,this was a gift -- my daughter chose it -- but its for TALL people!????we ended up sending it back -- but its a good idea--her being vertically challenged is our only complaint -- not the ball chair's fault! I've tried to edit the review to show 4 starts -- it won't allow changes to that portion!
2,Not worth the money,"The ball itself is great, all of the pieces were delivered in a timely manner.... but...This chair refuses to stay assembled! The bolts keep falling out, the chair squeaks and creaks and feels very unstable at all times. I have resorted to sitting on the ball alone. I would not buy this product again."
1,"Piece of Crap, avoid if you spend any real time in the chair","I've had this chair for a while. It's junk! The joint between the legs and the swivel/frame is loose, so in addition to the instability of the ball, the whole chair wobbles - in my case, the frame moves about 8"" in all directions from center when sitting on it, it's that loose. No apparent way to adjust or fix. This is way beyond the desired wobble of the ball itself. It doesn't appear to be well made. I wish I had returned it while in warranty. Lesson learned."
1,Not for prolonged sitting,"I like the concept more than the product itself. I tend to sit at my computer for hours at a time and don't take many breaks. This chair is comfortable for the first half-hour or so and at that point my experience is general soreness of the tail bone, ""nether parts,"" and the small of the back. As you can see from the product description, the ball itself is plastic. Plastic does not dissipate heat well. In addition to soreness in said nether parts one may expect to experience some localized sweating. Perhaps a towel on the chair would help, though I've not bothered--I'm back in my old wooden chair (with pillow!) in my search of a better office chair."
3,"Decent, but too tall.","I am 6 feet tall and read the reviews/details that this chair was recommended for those over 5'8"" so I bought it. The chair is fine for my height but it puts me up too tall for a regular desk! My knees actually bumped underneath my office desk and I had to slouch over to type (which completely defeats the purpose of having a ball chair in the first place!). It would be perfect, if it were adjustable height-wise like most office chairs are. Lucky for me, my husband is a carpenter and when he built me my home office desk, he made it extra tall since we're both tall. Thus, I use the ball chair at home. Even so it still seats me up a bit more than I like so I switch back and forth to a regular chair when I find myself beginning to slouch over the keyboard....I bought the Fitball seating disc for my office chair for 1/4 the price and it works just as well there and I can adjust my chair accordingly."
5,The Real Deal,"Mr. Grave's outstanding book is at once highly entertaining, suspensful, educational and terrifying. Mr. Graves work is clearly the product of extensive real-world experiance. He offers the reader a tour-de-force of South American politics, national and inter-national crime and corruption, all manner of terrorism and narcotics trafficking, weaponry and tactics, high-risk personnel survival, and even some high altitude medical physiology. Graves also points out, in chilling detail, how vulernable the US is to devastating terrorist attacks the likes of which have, fortunately, never been seen before. ""Bulletproof"" is a must read. It is what Clancy would write had he actually lived it."
3,Heading Nowhere,"Created at a brink of collapse of the USSR, in a late Gorbachev epoch, this work is as gloomy as a disillusioned life of locals found them betrayed and short of a long-promised communist happy future was.Juxtaposition of the army barracks with the life surrounding leaves more for viewers' imaginations than screened, in the usual Russian tradition of liberties censored far beyond a date of this movie-making.It is hard to understand particulars/a plot of a story from segments graphically over exaggerating a general landscape of brutality and carelessness macho-culture is famous for in general, in a regiment of 18-20-old conscripts especially.Factually, erotics (taboo for Soviet artists), strong homoeroticism and s&m; hints are the most specific features securing a place apart this Soviet produce possessed among then local movies."
2,My daughter cried her eyes out,"My 18 month old daughter was very uncomfortable in this outfit. I cut the elastic on the arms for extra room, but the material was still too scratchy. I thought it ran really small, as she is very petite as it is. The price and look were great, but not practical for a young toddler."
2,not satisfied,"I bought this for my baby's first birthday. It looks cute on her but there are some details that I don't like. 1st, the elastic bond on the sleeve. 2nd, I think the size wouldn't fit infants beyond 12 months old. My baby will be a year old in less than 2 wks and it just fits her perfectly. 3rd, it would be hard to change a diaper because you need to take off the whole thing. Because of that, I will just have my baby wear it for a couple of picture taking then change her to a different minnie mouse outfit."
2,Cute costume but not made well,Costume adorable but sequins come off too easily. By the end of the day half were missing. I tried to glue some back on when costume was first received but by the time Halloween came and went most had come off.
4,Check Sizing before ordering!,"I wanted to get this for my daughter for her first halloween this year but I was debating for months after reading all of the mixed reviews on it. My daughter is big for her age. She'll be 1 next week and she is already 24lbs and a little over 30"". Alot of people kept complaining about this costume being too small for their kid but if you check the sizing chart you'll be able to see if it will fit your infant or not. 12-18mth says it fit up to 26lbs and 32"" so I took a chance and ordered it and it fits her fine. When I opened it I did think it looked small but I tried it in her and it looks good and fit her perfect. If she was any bigger maybe it wouldn't fit. I also added a pair of black tights under the dress and it looks really cute."
2,Not that great!,"I bought this costume for my daughter's first b'day as I was doing Minnie Mouse theme. Material is very very cheap.It looks pretty in picture but when i received it, I was disappointed. Not worth the money I paid. Also, It is tight for my daughter. she usually fits in 12 months clothes, but this one was is very tight. Its wastage of money. I will not recommend to spend 17 bucks on this costume"
1,not as pictured at all!!,the costume looks adorable but its not. its made so cheaply! the sleeves are mesh and so uncomfortable. the bottom of the sleeve had elastic i guess so it can look poofy but it was so tight on her arms it made a mark. i had to return it. the skirt part had no body to it. it had no tafeta. i dont recommend it. i ended up buying one drectly from disney store and that one was soooooooooo adorable!!
3,The ninth book in the humorous series.,"This science-fiction story for youth is the ninth book in the humorous Norby series about a young space cadet and his unusual robot Norby. In this tale, Norby, Jeff, and others travel to the planet Jamyn to go to a birthday party for that planet's ruler, the Grand Dragon. But, soon thereafter the planet is threatened by a giant cloud that completely covers Jamyn. They also soon discover that the cloud is sentient."
1,Wrong Alloy!,"This product is mislabeled. Twice I was sent a tube made from 6063 not 6061. 6063 is not as strong, or hard as 6061. Also 6063 does not machine as well as 6061 and is usually much cheaper. The product page needs to be updated to show what is actually being shipped. Do not buy this item if you need need 6061 alloy."
4,Great coolant manifold material.,"I needed to make a very simple coolant manifold for my CNC and this did the trick.Cut it to length, drilled and tapped the holes to the correct size, installed two end caps and tada! A coolant manifold with some extra material left over.Pros:Cheap.Cut very cleanly.Cons:None."
3,Looks feasible. Don't want to need it.,I think this is pretty standard material compared with some local camping stores. Cheaper price but the same material. I believe this would work as a temporary solution to a splint need.
4,"Works the same as a SAM Splint, just less expensive","Works exactly like a SAM Splint at a fraction of the cost. The only reason I did not rate at five stars is the lack of instructions/documentation that comes with this splint. However, you can always run an internet search for the SAM Splint and view the video instructions on their web site."
4,Splint,"My splint came folded flat as apposed to rolled as shown in the picture. It is made of study aluminum that could support a fracture of the ulna or radius (formarm bones) reasonably well. The arm of course would have to be immobalized to avoid the arm from swinging. Although a thin layer of foam covers the aluminum, you can not mold the splint directly over a sensitive limb since the aluminum needs to be study enough to support & stabalize the fracture. Additional padding may or may not be necessary. The splint should be molded prior to actual application, then applied with some minor tweaking and finally secured to the limb. Overall, a good compact splint to carry in your emergency kit."
4,Good splint,"These splints are pretty cool, haven't used one in the field yet though. Versatile little guys, seem like they would support and help stabilize a radius, ulna, and/or a wrist break pretty well."
1,it not the best,its not 100% correct. also it doesnt have any of the solo's. but on the up side it give a good idea of how to play it. and it also explands where the song came from.
2,"Works, but nothing great","The protector has a lightly sticky backing that I used on a digital camera. My complaints include the fact that the squeegee does not take all the air pockets out, it leaves little scratches on the protector, and the product description was not too great. It says up to 12 protectors - well, that depends on the size of your screen. I have a 3"" wide screen, so I only can get 6 out of the sheets provided. If you need something on your screen for protection, this will do...but don't expect much from it."
3,"Good protectrors, but...","Good protectors, fit and stick well to all LCDs. I also used it for my PDA and works perfect. My only complaint is the ""squeegee card"" that comes to apply the protectors makes little scratches on them. They should make them from a different material (not cardboard). Meanwhile, I advise not to use it."
4,Good for cell phone & gameboys,"Use these for screen protectors on my Blackberry and kids Gameboys. They work great, and seem to last very well.Great cheap insurance to protect any small screen you need to keep scrathes off of (camera, phone, PS2, etc.)"
3,hard to get on right,"I had a really hard time getting the screen protector to go on without any big bubbles all over the screen. I kept pulling it up and trying again many times, and I finally gave up when I got in on with only a couple small bubbles."
3,Good,"These are difficult to place on the lcd correctly, I think any protector would be so this is not the products fault.Good bang for buck."
4,Screen protectors,This is a nice product to have for electronics. I used it for my camera and my gps and it worked well.
1,rechargeable cordless phone battery,"Well, this is not what I expected. The battery life only lasts for less than a month. You can only use the phone for about 10-15 minutes, you'll get that low battery buzz if you use it longer. I guess you get what you deserve for its price. It's unfortunate that I can't find this type of battery anywhere else but here. I may have also an old model for cordless phones."
5,"""Columbia Men's Bonehead Short Sleeve Shirt Big,SAGE,3X""","This is a shirt, very comfortable and durable material for daily use I am very satisfied with this high quality product qualifies her as one of the best shirts on the market."
2,I think I received an irregular shirt,"While the shirt is genuine Columbia, it was so wrinkled that the wrinkles won't come out. The pocket flaps are permanently curled out and I have to iron the shirt after every wash to keep it from looking silly. I also thought this shirt would be comfortable in the heat, but I was soaked in sweat wearing it and it took a very long time before it was dry. Definitely not worth the money."
1,A MAJOR disappointment!,"I bought this DVD thinking I would see all that I saw so many years ago in the movie theatre... The best scenes are edited out, for example the scene where Baron Harkonnen pulls the heart plug on a captive then takes a blood shower - that got cut. Guess someone was offended to see an evil character doing something evil. LOTS of the best scenes are cut. This ""extended edition"" is just a lot of trash picked up off the cutting room floor.If you still want to buy this DVD, save some money and I will send you my own (played only one time) DVD, just cover my postage cost. It is NOT worth owning."
3,Good for a sci-fi fan.,"Filled with stunning visuals and a futuristic feel, Dune is the perfect movie for a fan of science fiction.It ends there. This movie is too deep for the average movie buff."
1,It will take more than creativity to win my approval,"This movie seems to be made more for fans of the actors and not fans of Dune. Using people such as Patrick Stewart as Hallack is just to much for me to bare. And still they create utter trash such as ""wierding modules"" depress me even more. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! SHUN IT! The sci-fi version is so much better."
3,Dune Injured By Bad Film,"The book Dune by Frank Herbert was incredible, but this film was poorly made and hard to follow. I didn't understand any of it until I watched it a second time. Once you do understand it, however, it is pretty good. Patrick Stewart is awesome!"
2,What the heck is this?,"I've seen this movie several times, the first time some years ago in the middle of the night. I watched frozen in horror, unable to look away. I admit I have not read the book, so I wasn't too worried about following some kind of story (I could watch with the sound turned off). The visuals are striking, but so very ugly - the long eyebrows, the boils, and what was that ghastly octopus thing in the tank giving orders?!!! The absurd comic-opera costumes, like palace guards in Lichtenstein. The bald nuns or whatever, and their creepy costumes. Loved the sandworms, so I give it a star for them, and loved Kyle /Paul, I give it another star for his performance. He stood out like a lilly on a dungheap, as beautiful as the others were ugly. (and his mom wasn't bad, either)."
1,COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER !!!,"I liked the book DUNE very much. When I saw the movie, I found out that Lynch had wasted a hellful pile of money and a good story. If only someone made a good DUNE film..."
1,Expensive garbage,"Hmmm. I read and enjoyed Dune, and thought Herbert just gradually lost it on all the sequels. Lynch came along, made this movie and short-circuited his way to utter garbage. Expensive to make, this thing died in the theatres, and rightfully so. It still turns my stomach."
3,Both great and awful be warned. Effects at times are horrific,Some sets are astonashing. The Emperors palace for one. Cut to sandland and the dreadful matte shots that look Land of The Lost 70's bad. You can almost SEE where Lynch ran out of money.
4,fine example of science fiction,"Dune is one of the best science fiction movies in a long time. The acting was great but the movie had some obvious problems with editing. David Lynch originally planned for the movie to be four hours long, but Universal Studios feared no one would watch it if it were too long. Well, the movie was clocked at around 2 hours 17 minutes, felt too short, and it earned less than 1/10 of the money Empire Strikes Back made. Also, nearly all of Virginia Madsen's scenes seemed to have been left in the editing room. The special effects were second rate compared with Star Wars or even the recent X-Files movie. But the movie had a good plot that is actually pretty easy to understand if you just pay attention in the beginning. I loved the musical score, especially during the end credits."
3,not the 190min version ...,"this is the stripped down 2hr version. i wonder if they will ever release the movie in it's entirety. if it were, i'd bump the rating to 5."
4,"Great movie, poor DVD",The movie it self is fantastic. The DVD would match if they put a little more effort into it. They left out key scenes that without them leave me a bit confused to the plot.
3,Dune: Which version do YOU have?,"The best version of this particular film is the one NOT narrated by Princess Irulan, but by a male narrator. There is a lot of fore-story, and many more scenes that are key to linking the book to the movie (i.e. seeing how the Water of Life is made, more asides, etc.) Although NO movie ever matches the book (known as cinemutation), this one is as close as they come. END"
1,I'm a big fan of this movie but...,"... the extended version of the film has some serious problems. I bought this dvd after waiting years for a more complete version to come out. Sadly side two of this single disc release has some serious errors. Around halfway through the film my copy would pause for a few minutes, eventually skip forward, pause,play, pause, skip forward, and then it would eventually play normally with a few more pauses. After looking online I found that this problem seems to be very common due to how the disc was made. So to wrap this up, I'm a fan of the movie, but this DVD is sold to you broken thanks to Universal Studios messing it up."
1,"This is the worst ""film"" ever made!","Don't buy this tape, its bad. Very bad. Really.Definition of a tragedy: A great book from a great author turned into a disaster by that crazy Lynch fellow. Calling this dreck a ""film"" is too much of a compliment. Ed Wood could have done a better job (At least you can laugh at ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"").What's really galling about this trash is that you can see all the wrong directorial turns coming in the film right before they happen. Bad dialog, marginal ""acting"" and hearing characters thoughts throughout the flick all contribute to this failure of a movie.They should take the proceeds from video sales and use them to re-make this film into something watchable. Its worse than watching paint dry. (It should get -20 stars but Amazon won't permit that)"
4,underrated,"I've heard it said that if you haven't read the book you'd be lost in this movie. I read the book and it was still a bit confusing! I like this version of the film with all the extra footage. Such a fantastic looking picture this was. I saw this in the theater when it came out. I remember a bit of controversy regarding the billing. Sting was touted as starring in this film, when in reality he had a supporting role. Shame on the movie execs who tried to capitalize off of his name and the then massive popularity of his band, The Police. It was nothing more than a ploy to get his fans into the theater. Having said that, Sting is actually pretty good in this film. He sneers, he wise cracks, he fights, and he looks pretty in his futuristic speedo. Of course, he gets killed in the end. Oh well."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I had read and enjoyed the first 3 Dune novels and was very excited about seeing this film when it first came out. I'm not quite sure how I managed to sit through this dreadful mess. I did like some of the look of the film but too many things, like the Guild Navigator, looked so silly it made me groan. And the special effects were very poorly executed. The giant sandworms looked like glove puppets. The last scene with the totally miscast little girl lisping the final grand statement was so bad I still can't imagine what David Lynch was thinking. Lynch should have just told this story as a straight ahead adventure and dropped all the internal thoughts, they felt very awkward. Even with all its fights and battles Dune never generates any real excitment or mystery. Flashy and weird yet dull, like a ball gown on a dead horse."
2,"If you want to see Dune, watch the Miniseries","Ug. I really dislike this movie. Dune is one of my favorite books, and this movie totally ruined it. It is boring, confusing, unfaithful to the book, and just plain badly done. If you want to see the real Dune, watch the amazing miniseries done by sci-fi channel and it's sequel, Children of Dune. Both are much better done and much more faithful to the source material."
1,This was Dune?,"Ok This movie had little to do with the books. Thufir you need to keep this cat alive. Baron I love your diseases, heart plugs, really? No swords, weirding modules? Rain in the open desert, sure kill the worms, the over working ""The sleeper has awaken"". If you love Dune you'll likely hate this."
1,"Absolute massacre, the revenge of the baldies","I read this book just a year or so before the movie came out. Thought it was one of the best sci-fi books ever written (still think so nearly 3 decades later). As you can imagine could not wait to watch the movie. Still remember the dead shock of betrayal that lasted that whole evening and then some.Talk of butchery. Dont think the makers actually ever read the book or understood what Frank Herbert had created. From a thoroughly woody Paul who goes through the whole movie, including many desert and fight scenes, without a strand of long hair out of place to awful looking baldies that were the Bene Gesserit to rain in the desert at the end - that was sacrilige.My advice, dont bother. Watch the mini series from 2000 instead or better still, just read the book."
1,Amazingly boring,"Ok, the special effects are great for the time this movie was made, but that's really all this movie has going for it. I am most disappointed by having to give this a full star rating. The plot is mechanical with a lame voice-over back story. The characters shallow and lacking any legitimate motivations or redeeming quality. Honestly, I can't see what all the hype is about."
1,DUNE (Extended Edition),"The movie on DVD that I received was in a beautiful case, but the movie was distorted on the Theatrical release side and the Extended side. I used a DVD player, both computers in my home and I tried it in a friend's DVD player to make sure that there was nothing wrong with my equipment. Please just refund my credit card. This is the first time that I have had a complaint with Amazon. I have received other DVDs and they were in perfect cndition. Thanks, Janice Mack Dickerson"
2,missing links,"If you watched this movie when it was originally in theaters, you will be badly surprised with the number of deleted scenes and content without which it is impossible to draw a parallel with the original master piece - F. Herbert's book.The DVD version of the movie is atrociously cut and it's hardly worth renting, let alone purchasing it.Technically, the sound and picture are good enough - nothing about it could make the overall impression better.In terms of characters, Alia's and Baron's personalities could have been worked out better, but in the whole context their appearance is equally mediocre.The writer of this review watched all other versions of Dune and also read the original book - perhaps if the director had more saying, this (disappointment) would not have happened."
2,"Dune, the short version","The short version of the film, which is what I purchased, gets 1 star if you haven't read the book or 3 starts if you have read the book. The longer director's cut is much better but unavailable for purchase at amazon."
4,Dune,"I actually enjoy this movie, my fiancee makes me watch it every time it's on tv so I bought it for him. Unfortunatly I thought it was the extended director's cut when I bought it, which is what he very much wanted, and when we got it...it wasn't. No biggie still enjoyable."
4,"If you love the book, you'll probably love the movie...","It is close to the book, even though it's somewhat compressed version. I like the acting, too. However, special effects are not so special. They often look very artificial, cut-and-paste type... Maybe next remake will take care of that."
2,"Excellent movie, just not on DVD","I really, really liked the ""full version"" of Dune that was released on TV (with the new prologue). I was bitterly disappointed to find that none of the new footage appeared on this release, however; several *critical* scenes that appeared on TV are now missing. Although a couple new scenes do appear, they are minor compared to the deletions. I would say this release is for collectors only."
1,wow....this sucks!,"I love the Dune universe. The novels (the Frank Herbert ones, not the Brain Herbert/Kevin Anderson crap), the games, the DAVID LYNCH movie. This extended edition is NOT by David Lynch. The ""extended scene"" are nothing more than a series of color pencil drawings in the beginning that do not add anything, just rehash the story before the movie starts, except talking about the overthrowing of the machines, which, I'm guessing, Brian Herbert had a big say in. Anyway, please, please don't waste your money on this. Just buy the original David Lynch version. The deleted scenes, by the way, are AWFUL, and it is obvious, then, why Lynch did not include them. I wish I could get my money back for this [...]. I think I'll donate it to the library as I already have the original on DVD. This version deserves negative stars, oh, if it were only possible."
4,DUNE Extended Edition,This Movie is one of my favourites and I am very glad to have found here on Amazon as it is not easy to get a hold of. I have notice that on both the theatrical version and the extended version of this DVD it did have some damaged areas that my computer had to skip (frustrating). I am pleased with my purchase overall.
4,Dune-Blu-ray,"This is exactly like the original theatrical release, cleaned up alot, although some scenes might be clipped just a little in transitions. Comes out the same length tho. No chance to check BD sound, but video was good. It is NOT the extended version; as I have both the original and extended in DVD format."
2,Odd film,"I like Dune, but this David Lynch version of Dune (Extended Edition) is somewhat old and odd. It's probably too foreign and freaky for most audiences. It's not always faithful to the book, in the worst possible ways. In one infamous scene, Baron Harkonnen kills a boy-servant by pulling his heart plug. What does that add to the movie?I recommend Frank Herbert's Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Special Edition Director's Cut) (3-Disc DVD Set) over this version. The computer-generated special effects aren't great, but everything else is an improvement."
2,Widescreen doesn't compensate for lost content,"Dune, uncut, is a classic. This sliced-and-diced widescreen version dropped at least two vital sequences (I haven't had the time to look for more). First, Paul's call-out fight upon his and Jessica's first ecounter with the Fremen, the transfer of responsibility for the children of the slain Fremen and the passage of his water to Paul for safekeeping for the Tribe limns the character of the Fremen and their relationship to tradition and water -- a must for better understanding of actions to follow. Also cut was the process of removing the bile of the infant worm (The Water of Life). It's origin is vital to understanding one facet of the planet's importance to the Bene Gesserit and the relationship between the worms and the mystical culture surrounding them. Again, widescreen is nice but why, oh why, for a few cents' worth of tape, did they cut anything? The original, albeit in TV format, deserves a full row of stars."
5,Unearthly Masterpiece!!,"What a work of art!! The literary works of Frank Herbert finally come to life on the screen in boundless glory. The conflict faced between the races of the Fremen, the Harkonnen, and the Padishah Emperor himself is displayed magnificently on film. Acting talent fueled from a large group of spectacular actors makes this movie a definite precursor to all of the sci-fi blockbusters of today. The special effects and dialogue prove undoubtedly that this screenwork was far beyond its time when it was released into theatres. ""Dune"" is a must for fantasy!"
2,"Ugh, it makes Dune look horrible","Soon after reading Dune, I found this movie and watched it. I had heard that it was nothing like the book, but I was not prepared for what I saw. The beginning was good-the book was followed exactly. But then came the rest, and I found myself to be watching a movie about this superhuman who was capable of anything (not to mention being portrayed as something of a deity). It was nothing like the book."
2,Genre fans only,Good special effects and a mouth dropping production design can't overcome a rather vague and oppressive plotline. The idea of being able to hear what the characters are thinking wasn't very bright.
1,Yawn.,"Everyone says Dune is VISUALLY IMPRESSIVE, but it isn't! The film quality, the silly costumes, the special effects and the sets all make it look like it was made in the 1940s...never mind 1984. I'm sure the characters' constant inner monologues worked in the book, but they just look stupid on film. The plot is confusing. Heck, the only aspect that impressed me were the giant worms, but even they were too slow to stun audiences. It's difficult to keep a straight face when watching it, because there are many characters who have laughably fake hair and moustaches. On the whole, silly, overlong and drab. Even though I haven't read the book, I'm sure it's better than this. I mean this was made AFTER Star Wars, you'd expect it to look reasonably good!"
2,disappointment,"After devouring the entire Dune series I really looked forward to the film. In some ways it is quite nice. The special effects & all of the obvious, up front - surface - material is well done. (though ""special effects"" rarely wear well with age and depending on them to drive a story isn't the smartest directorial decision if longevity and/or timelessness is a consideration. But who am I kidding? How often are those matters considered?) On the other hand anything that required a bit of thinking - philosophic issues, non-spectacular matters that are important to the core of the saga, maybe slightly more than casual reading - simply was left out. Herbert's tales are a joy to read. I remember savoring each one, looking forward to the next installment & ultimately being incredibly depressed when he died before giving us some sort of satisfying finale. This film just doesn't do justice to Dune."
2,Pretty Boring Stuff,"I saw this in 1984, I thought it was cool then. Watching it on HD DVD, I thought it would be great. But now I realize how boring the film was."
1,Absolutely horrible,"I am a sci-fi buff, but this movie is nothing short of horrible. Horrible stiff acting, horrible scenes, etc. Do yourself a favor and get the Dune that came out in 2000 as a mini series. That is a great movie, much better acting throughout and much easier to follow, but it is very long (not in a bad way)."
1,How do I erase my memory?,Contains utterly ugly disturbing violence. When it was over I wanted to cleanse the memory from my mind.
1,the worst sci/fi flick next to the Matrix,"David Lynch must have lost a bet and had to direct this long,boring tripe as the bet.The reason this movie is terrible is because it is long and boring to sit through and even for a David Lynch film it was unwatchable.Avoid this one and the 2000 version because there a waste of time or money.There better things to do for 3 hours."
1,Have we seen the same movie?,"I can't believe all of the positive reviews of this film...I saw it in the theater back in 1984 and hated it, then saw the extended version on TV, hoping for better, it wasn't...frankly this film blows...I love the books, have read them all and was looking forward to the film from the moment I heard that David Lynch was making it...it was the biggest disappointment of the 80's. The TV miniseries has it's flaws but is Oscar quality compared to this. Wish I could give it 0 stars."
2,star wars wanna be ?,it turned out to be a little weird.... and whats with all the people annoyingly whispering and thinking to themselves...
4,A must have for fans of the story...,I first watched the extended version of Dune as a teen...seeing it again brought back so many good memories. I still believe there's an even longer version out there and eagerly await it's release.
1,A weak attempt at a classic,"For fans of the worlds of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" this is a sorry exercise and a total waste of film. Hopefully the 3 disc saga put to film by the Sci-Fi channel (directed by John Harrison) will get the full Blu-ray treatment. In the meantime I'll wait. Thanks but no thanks"
5,Dune the Movie,what else can i say about this movie except every sci-fi fan should owned it - a true classic !it ain't the book but still a great movie
1,Skip This Embarrassing Mess,"Having just read the book, I decided to rent the DVD. What a complete and total disaster.The only two things I actually enjoyed about this were the designs of the stillsuits and the casting of Max von Sydow as Kynes.The story is so compressed that all sense of scope, depth, and purpose are completely undermined. The acting alternates between wooden and melodramatic. The Harkonnens have been transformed into circus freaks. Nearly everybody is miscast.And worst of all, it's BORING!This movie should have been put on a shelf and never released."
3,Terrible and poorly acted but amusing to watch.,"I read the books way before I saw this film... it was a pretty terrible adaptation... still, it had its moments and was amusing..."
2,A DVD?,"The movie looks like a poor quality Kazaa download burnt onto a DVD. I understand that the movie is very old, but they could at least format it for DVD, no?"
3,This movie wasn't as good as I remembered,"I enjoyed this movie as a kid, but not as much when I saw it again years later.Great quality on Blu ray."
4,worth buying AGAIN!,"just like the blu-ray copy of An American Werewolf in London, Dune was also worth buying in blu-ray. it's like watching it for the first time again. a much brighter pic, just like Werewolf."
1,VIDEO NOT 1080P OR I,I had been waiting for the bluray version; but his is poorest quality not even 720p more like VHS transfered to cd. Don't buy if you expect to have a sharp non-pixled picture!
4,Why hasn't there been a DVD of the 4 hr. version,"I bought a copy on VHS of the movie when it first came out years ago before DVD's and my copy is 4hrs. Why cant they offer a DVD version now? I like the 4 hr. version. The first time I saw the new one, I noticed all the missing parts and wondered what happend to it. Just wasn't the same movie."
2,Alright...until you read the book.,"I saw this once; thought it was decent. Then I read the book, and realised just how BAD it was in comparison. It's now impossible for me to watch this and NOT think about what it could have been, if there'd been a genuine attempt to transfer the book's depth to the screen.Not bad if you've never read the book; but if you love good sci-fi, READ THE BOOK INSTEAD."
4,'s not the book,"There are plenty of problems with this movie, but if you can ignore the fact that it is based on the greatest work of scifi of all time you can have a pretty decent time with it."
3,A dimming opinion.,"I have watched the vhs version enough times to know what scenes were cut out of the sci-fi version a few years back. And when seeing the DVD, I figured it would be a full version and would contain everything from both versions. Well, sad to say I watched in horror as I became more and more dissapointed. Many key linking scenes were cut from this film and made it (as stated in an above review) confusing at times. These key scenes were background history and other important fillins. I recommend the vhs over this DVD anyday. You will find it more appealing."
5,At Last!,"Finally a legit, fairly pristine extended version...even my wife (who hates these types of films) understood the extended version more clearly, thus enjoying the story better. I'm biased, but the film should never have been cut in the first place!"
4,"Flawed , but you can't have everything !","This film is sci fi and is brought to you by a director who has taken film fans on a few strange trips .DUNE is no exception , but I do recommend you read the book first . It will fill in the spaces in the film's plot .The book has a glossary in the back , which will give you some idea of how many words are specific to the language and meanings .The film doesn't always explain things , which can be effective , but maybe it leaves too much to the imagination - you get a feeling it has been shortened as you watch it , but the story largely makes sense .For those who wish to go to another world , DUNE is the film to watch ."
5,"Great book, good movie --- just don't compare the two","I saw this movie long before I read the book. Maybe that's why I like it. Big fans of the book seem to not like the movie since it isn't very faithful to the book. Me, I can enjoy the visuals of the movie and enjoy the literature of the book separagely. Compare the two and the movie fails."
4,It grows on you,"The very first time I saw this movie was on television where they aired a special 190 minute version which contained important scenes and a more detailed introduction that makes the movie a lot easier to understand. With out a doubt this has to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made visually. I have seen this movie countless times and each time I am amazed by the special effects. I gave this movie 4 stars and not 5 because you have to watch it more than once to understand it. There is just too much going on in this movie than can be taken in the first time you watch it. I also highly suggest watching the extended version to get a far better understanding. If you like to let your imagination go free, you will love this movie as it will become one of your favorite movies ever as it has for me."
4,Excellent visual interpretation of Herbert's classic novel,"Dune the movie is an outstanding translation of Herbert's *very* original novel. If you read the book (and I HIGHLY recommend doing this before you see the movie) you'll find that the fusion of gothic and sci-fi story elements are well represented. But, be aware that Dune is a complex story, with at least six interweaving plot elements and the movie will likely be incomprehensible if this is all you see. And so I give the movie 4 stars because it is such a literal translation of the book that it needs some explanation to the lay moviegoer. Get the expanded version if possible!"
3,Marginally Worthwhile,"This DVD doesn't have much that's new in terms of the film itself; one side has the theatrical release, the other the ""Alan Smithee"" version. In my opinion the Alan Smithee version is simply nasty - there are strange cuts and additions in the middle of characters speaking, the Prologue is long, poorly written, and the narrator is just wrong - he proves during the course of the film that he can't even say ""Piter de Vries"" correctly. There are stupidities such as trying to show the arrival of characters by presenting stock footage of a Harkonnen ship flying, even if the character arriving isn't a Harkonnen.The original David Lynch cut which Frank Herbert approved of, remains a mystery.Finally, there does not appear to have been any enhancement to the film quality; it doesn't seem to have been remastered.That said, there are some small extras like Deleted Scenes and Designing Dune which are interesting. If you are a heavy Dune fan, these extras make the DVD worth owning."
3,dissapointment,"what can i say, i was hoping that this was my dream melding of the tv version with the crappy naration and missing scenes and the theatrical release with good naration and missing scenes. but it's not, it's just both. while the mini series does cover the story better, lynch did capture the feel and look i'd always imagined, except for the wierding module stuff. whoever said that explained how the fremen defeated the sardukar missed the point that EVERYONE in this particular universe is armed with knives and pistols, because of personal shields. and yes, i know i'm a dork and that my spelling is terrible, which is besides the point."
2,Universal another studio disappoints me,"Well I was hoping for the whole movie. The director's cut of this movie. Which was excellent. But of course the studio sells the cheap version of the movie. I wish these studios would give the consumer what they want. I want all those scenes that you deemed to delete, which then makes people ask well why did he do that? I all these studios realize their stupid mistakes and put out some better dvd's with more features. Like a director's cut, or deleted scenes, behind the scenes. In my opinion don't buy this movie wait and hope it comes out in the director's cut."
3,THIS IS NOT THE LONGEST VERSION OF DUNE,"THIS VERSION IS OKAY IF YOU WANT TO SEE DELETED SCENES AND SOMEPRODUCTION STUFF, WHICH ISN'T A LOT. IF YOU WANT THE LONG LASER DISC VERSION FEATURING THE INFAMOUS HEART PLUG SCENE, RABBAN EATING THE COWS EAR ETC, THEN YOU NEED THE BOOTLEG VERSION, WHICH REALLY IS THE BEST, COMBINING THE THEATRICAL RELEASE ANDTHE TELEVISION VERSION."
1,What a disapointment...,"Well, my review is a short one...I am a real fanatic of all the novels, I read the six of them 5 times, both in French and in English...BUT this movie is way too weird, most of the actors are week, it's like dune in Twin Peaks...Well, no thanks, the true fans will understand the incompatibility !!!!"
5,"Glorious, Pseudo-religious Bombast!","I am a fan of the original books written by Frank Herbert.A 2 hour movie could never hope to capture the detail present in those novels.David Lynch does not attempt it. His Dune looks like a slice of religious instructional propaganda from the year 10 000 A.D. You can't watch this as a version of the book, it almost isn't. It's a peek into the Dune universe and enjoyable in its resulting inscrutability.If you can learn to enjoy movies for something other than straight narrative and character development, then you might enjoy this. leave that stuff to other movies.I still think it sets the pace for visual interpretations of science fiction novels. When I read Dune, I think of the David Lynch movie. The mini-series looked like a campy stage production."
5,"Dune, Arrakis, Dessert Planet...","Well, I have to say this is heck of a good movie. I like it becaus I just like it. Maybe it would even be better if they'dskipped the 'child-in-the-womb' scenes, becous that was discusting.The movie itself are as I expected. The characters and suits andships AND all that stuff fit perfectly, as in the book. If youwant to see Dune:Miniseries, do not, it will ruin Dune. Trust me."
1,My vote for the worst film ever made.....,"It is quite telling that that the only people I've met who have enjoyed this film saw it while stoned. Let's face it folks, this film is pretentious, dull, lifeless, incoherent, and all the analysis in the world won't make it any more entertaining. Frankly, I don't care if this film holds the secrets to life's meaning; it's still unwatchable. Who are these characters? What does the plot mean? Who could possibly care? Save some time and take a nap instead."
2,Certainly Not The Dune I Imagined,"I remember being so excited to see the movie adaption of my favorite SciFi classic. It was disappointing . . . almost a caricature of the book and not at all what was conjured up in my mind, at least. Do yourself a favor if you are a Dune fan . . . Get the Scifi Channel's version, which I thought was amazingly done, and is a much more faithful version of Dune."
1,THIS FILM IS BAD BY: ANTHONY BENEDETTO,"A FILM THAT COULD BE LOADS OF FUN... WHATS WRONG YOU SAY IT TAKES IT SELF TO SERIOUSLY. ITS LONG BORING,AND WHERES THE FUN.. JUST BUY 2001 A MUCH SUPERIOR SCI-FI... WORST PART IS THERES NO CONCERN FOR ANY CHARACTERS AND LETS FACE KYLE MACLACHLIN CAN'T ACT"
2,This movie is an insult to the image portrayed by the book.,"This movie is an insult to the image portrayed by Frank Herbert in his Dune books. Not only does it ignore some of the most important aspects which Frank Herbert included in his books, but it is also neglegent in that it does not show any real cinematic quality. The internal monologes are long and often incomprehensible unless the viewer has read the book version, and even then there is confusion in that the movie does not corespond with the book in many aspects."
2,Whatever happened to Dune?,"I just couldn't believe what Dune has turned to. What I read was a thrilling political novel, only set in another time and another place. When I was watching the movie, I longed to see one consistent story, regardless of the details that might have been lost while adopting the novel to a movie. Everything I watched was, shallow, obscure and irrelevant. I wonder if Lynch really read the novel."
2,A poor use of DVD; a poor print of a primarily visual movie,"The DVD edition of Dune was poor, even if compared to VHS. The video should have been cleaned up, the audio is not Dolby 5.1, and the additional material is superficial. Also, there is no addition of unused footage despite the many versions of the movie Dune available on laserdisk."
1,wait,This is not an entirely comprehensible version of the book. There is a longer - I believe 3 1/2 hour version of the video that can be found in some exotic video stores that will eventually be transferred to DVD (I hope) which is a much more satisfying series of selected illustrations of the book. But the book is so well written (in parts) that it would be worth the effort just to skip this altogether
5,The best science-fiction film ever made...,"Dune is simply the best science-fiction film ever made. This is the film by which nearly all others try to model their sci-fi films after. For those who've read the book, keep in mind that you spent much longer than two hours reading it. There is only so much that can go into this film from the book. David Lynch did not put the book on film, rather, he has created a beautiful and chilling masterpiece."
4,"Dune was an exellent book, the movie however is...","Dune was a great book, a classic. The movie, one the other hand is hard to follow-- very much so if you havent read the novel. The cast was-- for the most part, B- rate. The speacial effects were-- what can I say? 1980's. The sand worms were cool. The music, some good songs (Main theme), some bad songs. I think my review was effected by my reading of the fasinating book."
2,This movie is Doomed ---There is a reason for Editors after all!,"Dune was an incredible story and incredible movie -- although albeit only the most diehard fans could follow it on first viewing. Others learned to love this master piece of sci fi done with no holds barred on the excellent filming, acting, directing, and music. Truly David Lynch was masterful. Ok, now let's get to the 'Extended Version' . This was just god-awful, it is obvious why David Lynch refused to have his name associated with the ridiculous mess with added footage and where good footage was replaced with bad. This version could be the basis for an entire course for movie Editors. It clearly makes one appreciate what good editing can do for a film, and how bad editing can destroy it -as it did for this Extended version of Dune. No wonder they had to use a fake director's name like 'Smithe'."
5,Great move if you have read the book,"Dune is a good movie if you have read the book. If you haven't read the book, it's very confusing. If you can get your hands on the 6 hour version it will make much more sense. It Has commentary by the author. END"
3,The film itself is one of my favorites,"I love the film. The problem was the audio, always trailing the actual speech of the actors. This was not due to internet connection problems or computer problems. The problem was inherent to the streaming itself."
5,Dune,Great movie! One of the best Sci-Fi movies of all times. Have watched it probably 10 or more times over the years.
4,Great Sci-Fi which may strain the brain,"This is not for the weak stomached or for those people who think a movie should have feeling in it. I am a Sci-Fi fan, and when I saw this movie for the first time I instantly knew it was great. Sci-Fi has gone almost completely Fiction with no real science anymore. When someone today creates a movie about a world they don't look at the consequences of the characters being in that world (except for Pitch Black). Dune is one of those movies which went down to the last detail to bring you Frank Herbert's book in the best adaptation I could get from it. The reason for the 4 stars is that the DVD doesn't have many options."
2,"""The book was better""","I made the mistake of seeing this movie before reading the book on which it was supposedly based. At first, I thought it was an interesting enough movie, with a few oddities and curious names thrown in, but then I read Frank Herbert's masterpiece, Dune. This film throws all the important details out the window, discarding key concepts that make Herbert's Dune Novels some of the most memorable books in the science fiction world. I must give the director credit for creative (if completely inaccurate) sets and props, and going through all this trouble to create a movie that didn't do so well, but the film doesn't do the book justice. Read Dune first, and you'll see what I mean."
5,Truly the greatest story ever told!,After watching the film a thousand times you truly begin to see the epic scope that is Dune and we must approach it as such.
5,"Excellent Movie, not as bad as you Heard.","i heard alot of Bad Remarks over this Movie with Howard the Duck from the Audiences and Critics and these Two Movies flopped but i loved them. this remains a classic just like Howard the Duck or Star Wars Episode I. i would recommend these titles to go with it: "" Stargate"" and "" Secret of NIMH"". and only the 1998 Godzilla flop was worse than this Movie."
1,Awful!!,"I'm feeling like I missed something considering all the positive reviews the other Amazon cutomers wrote. But I have to steal a line from Luke Skywalker to sum up this movie ""What a piece of junk!"""
2,Lynch has done better,"I love David Lynch. I love Dune. I hate David Lynch's Dune, and I bought it ironically, making the purchase while high."
1,clarify in what format this should be played,"DO NOT BUY THIS if you have a regular DVD player.. this only plays on HD-DVD, and as i was not aware and took the plastic off, was unable to return it. This needs to be more clearly clarified as a number of people were also unaware. Therefore you will be out 20.00$"
1,I was thinking zero stars but...,"I remember reading Dune when I was a teenager and being blown away by it. I instantly ran out and rented the movie and boy did it suck. Now here I am 20 years later and I thought maybe this extended edition would be better. Maybe the years that have passed will be much kinder to this version...nope, still sucked. I read a lot of reviews on here about David Lynch legacy garbage...I could care less about the director, Santa Claus could have directed it for all I care as long as it's faithful to the novel. This didn't accomplish it. Don't even get me started on ""Toto"" doing the music. I expected them to break out with ""Africa"" at any moment. An epic story deserves an epic soundtrack. And Sting....ug...nuff said. Thank God Lord Of The Rings learned from the failure of movies such as this. If you want to see a fairly faithful copy of Dune, rent the Mini-series from Sci-Fi. Not great but it's the closest to Dune ""story wise"" out there."
1,No point,"""Extended Edition"". Sure. This is why we'll go ahead and chop out this and that. An exceptional disappointment.Best bet is to get one of the 'spliced together' versions out there. Take the previous Dune DVD release and this extended hack and build your own version representing the best of the widescreen footage.DeLaurentis can go jump in a lake for all I care. At least the Sci-Fi channel version got the story right."
5,Hurry up already,"Most Dune fans have been waiting years for the extended version of the classic movie, I am no exception. Hopefully, the deleted scenes and extra this version have will be worth the wait. Why should fans in other parts of the world get first crack at this version while we here in North America have to wait?"
1,Skip This Embarrassing Mess,"Having just read the book, I decided to rent the DVD. What a complete and total disaster.The only two things I actually enjoyed about this were the designs of the stillsuits and the casting of Max von Sydow as Kynes.The story is so compressed that all sense of scope, depth, and purpose are completely undermined. The acting alternates between wooden and melodramatic. The Harkonnens have been transformed into circus [figures]. Nearly everybody is miscast.And worst of all, it's BORING!This movie should have been put on a shelf and never released."
1,Mediocre.....,"plodding and dull, with a muddled plotline, DUNE is a big letdown today as when I first saw it during its release in 1984. On of David Lynch's misfires."
2,This movie had certain flaws,"I enjoyed the novel Dune, and I enjoy David Lynch as a director, but this movie is pretty terrible. It was almost a literal adaptation of plot points in the novel, right down to internal monologue being dubbed over as we hear the characters thinking. Unfortunately it's not bad enough to be funny."
3,Brian Eno's music,"There are many flaws to the extended version on this DVD.The latest I have discovered is that Brian Eno's beautiful music score has been removed from the film, and replaced by other less pleasant music. Eno is in the credits, but the music is gone. Eno's atmospheric music was very important to the mood in the film.(You might also have noted that the Fremens eyes are not blue in the extended scenes)."
3,"confusing, but a good movie experience","Although Dune is confusing and can not compare with Frank Herberts *excellent* book, it is an enjoyable movie, so long as you don't think too much about the movies you watch. If you like to analyze them, this not the best movie or you, but if you like to be absorbed and experience the movie, it is ideal. I do recomend the book, however, which is one of the greatest Science Fiction works available, a classic."
2,Cool special effects... and that's about it.,"The special effects are good by today standards and they were excellent considering the time the movie was made, but after waching it, I keep thinkig that the title should be ""The making of Dune"". It plays more like a documentary than a story. You don't see what's going on, rather you are told by the actors thoughts. Edition is clumsy and abrupt: you are taken from one scene to another, with total disregard for plot or storyline. If you love sci-fi (like I do), you will not think the movie was a total waste. That's why I give it two stars instead of one."
3,Quirky but fun,"This first attempt to bring Frank Herbert's science fiction masterpiece to the screen after decades of ""development hell"" is too condensed and fragmented to be called a great film. Moreover, viewers who haven't read the book will find it an incomprehensible mess. For those who have, however, it's still a fun romp. How can you not like a film that features Patrick Stewart (before he became Captain Picard of Star Trek fame), Jurgen Procnow and Sting?"
3,hmmmmm,"Better than the version released in the theaters, but still leaving a lot to be desired. The retro style technology was far too blatant and did not really reflect what the book was trying to impart to the reader."
2,Why?,"It's (ticked) me off for a long time that Dune has not seen a ""proper"" release in the states. Every single (cruddy), worthless movie that gets released on DVD these days has all sorts of bonus footage, but not Dune. This is my favorite movie of all time, probably because I love the book and David Lynch so much. I have never seen the short version and don't plan on it. Why can't There be like a Criterion Collection release of dune. Why?"
2,"Will they ever release the ""Director's Cut""?","I thought this version was OK, but would prefer if they'd release the full uncut version on DVD (3+ hours). That's the one they sometimes show on the sci-fi channel...The prologue is a lot more informative, and there are a lot more explanations about what is supposed to be going on. I think just like ""Blade Runner"" is better w/the Director's Cut, ""Dune"" would be vastly improved."
4,This Directors Cut,This is a slightly different cut than seen on TV. It has 3 scenes not shown on the cuts shown on TV and leaves out 2-3 scenes that the TV adapted version has. It is not the complete movie yet is a nice compliment for someone with a tape of the of the other cut.The widescreen effect is excellant and thus much better.
4,"Well, hmmm...","Really, this isn't an overly good movie. The basic plot of the book is present and the acting is alright and the visuals are impressive, but nothing is really that outstanding. I think that it deserves 3.5 stars, but I'll give it four as 3.5 is not an option.As a side note: for anyone looking for the Alan Smithee version (aka: 4 hour version or full length version), don't bother. The video cut is much better, and the longer version just contains a bunch of sequences that were cut for a reason."
4,"Generally, I liked it","Yes, the movie is weird; yes, they changed a lot from the book, like another movie which shall remain nameless (*cough*""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""*coughcough*), and yes, it borders on the incomprehensible at times. Still, IMHO, it beats the hell out of the later remake, which is twice as long and half as interesting. The actors in this movie have great charisma, and besides, who can beat Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck? I ask you!The main flaw (again, IMHO) is that the ""long version"" has yet to be released on video or DVD, although it can be seen about once a year on the Sci-Fi Channel. The shorter version is just not enough; write your congressman and DEMAND the full-length extended cut of ""Dune"". 'Nuff said."
3,Appealing only to fans of the book,When I first saw Dune I looked at a movie only fans of the book could love.Although it's visually impressive the plot line is too long to try to figure out.
1,Dune the movie,I brought Dune and In Harms Way. In harms way is a good movie. I CAN NOT however view Dune. don't know whats up with that? !!
2,production values were poor,one has to take into account when this miniseries was made.... having done that the production values were poor... the movie itself was not a fabulous retelling of the story but adequate....
1,The Blu ray did not play.,"I have not returned this blu ray product but it did not play in my Blu ray player.. I ahve a Panasonic player that does not link up with the internet. That may be the issue.. I would suggest you make sure it plays before you buy.. I will say, I may buy another Blu ray player as the set up still scenes were stunning in Bluray.. one of my fav movies so would like to see in Blu ray."
5,Classically beautiful.,"Frank Herbert's 1965 book, Dune, is a science fiction masterpiece. David Lynch's 1984 film, Dune, is one of those films I will watch again and again for as long as fossil fuels hold out. Oh, the irony. Like oil, the spice must flow! The remakes are nice, but I thought nothing could replace the classic David Lynch film--until it came out on Blu-ray. Watching Dune in 1080p is an experience for which it was worth waiting."
2,Dune Movie Superb - Blu Ray Mediocre,"I'll make it short.+'s - The movie is superb! The movie itself - especially if you are a Dune sci fi fan - is excellent, a very good rendition of the book. And the BluRay quality is up to snuff for a movie of this age.-'s - The BluRay functionality is clunky. The change from entry to menu to play to actually seeing the movie is incredibly slow. Don't lose your patience because it will eventually come onto your screen. The other mind bloggling goof is if you pause the movie, it goes into some kind of stasis and reverts to start. DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE YOUR CONTROLS ONCE YOU HAVE BEGUN.In short, for Dune lovers it's a great movie as long as you can bear with the poor functionality around the presentation. Hang in there!"
5,GOOD COLLECTER MOVIE,"recied fast and in good condition .. good movie , will buy from seller again .."
4,"""David Lynch's Dune is good for the performances, not the look or the story telling.""","I'm a big fan of Frank Herbert's Saga of Dune, and in my opinion, David Lynch's Dune is good for the performances for the actors, with the exception of Sting as Fade. The look of the flim doesn't present anything new of interesting that wasn't already seen in George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" a few years earlier. The story telling is ok for about two-thirds of the way through the movie ( in both versions), but the skip so much in the third-part of the story which really messes everything up. I didn't like the ending to the extended cut, but I thought the one for the theatrical cut was more interesting with Paul seeing his homeworld, and making it rain on arrakis at the end of the movie. Despite the flaws, I thought David Lynch's Dune was pretty good."
3,Dune: Extended Edition,"The extended edition is the exact same as many of the already available long versions. Just polished up. So if you've already seen the 3 hr version elsewhere, I wouldn't waste my time on it as I found theatrical version much more entertaining. The most annoying part of the extended version is the background music. It's like it never ends! Basically the same score throughout the entire movie! It even made some of the best scences anti-climatic! The extended version just ruins the whole movie. But if your a major Dune fan and want more of the movie, better to find yourself a copy of the Dune mini-series version. My favourite thus far...."
4,actually pretty good,forget the embarrassing dumb music stupid monologues and the fatc that a lot of the movie was changed by Lynch. This is a nicely made movie. It is not the best adaptation of Herbert's novel no but a nice scifi adventure it is. Kyle Maclachlan is perfect for the role of Paul Atreides. It should be remembered not as a failure for an adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic novel but instead one of the better use of special effects and scifi movies of the early 1980's. The special effects of this movie in my opinion were not matched again until Steven Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park.
3,"Good, but not good enough.","The only thing that saved this movie was the elaborate sets. I saw this when I was very young and recently rented it again to see if it could still capture my imagination. It failed. The acting was good, the scenes were amazing. Must have been a very expensive movie. On the other hand, the storytelling was horrible. You'd have to watch it at least 2 or 3 times to get the jest of everything. I found time management very poor. Didn't give characters proper time to develop. For instance, how did Paul and the girl fall in love. One minute shes ready to kill him for invading her tribe of freeman, and the next they are making love? My favorite scenes revolve around the mystery of the dreadful Spice Navigator ""Slug"" in the beggining of the movie. It was always very erie for me to watch him swim up to the front of his tank when talking to the Emperor. Good scenes. Good sc-fi eye candy. But a disappointment in the end. I'll have to read the book."
4,"Big sfx, Big plot","Well, Dune is definatly a bit bizar, but I still had fun watching it. It's a lot easier to like if your a sci-fi fan though. The plot in Dune is the hardest to follow I've ever seen. It's very compressed into it's two hour pressentation. So if your going to buy Dune, you should find the time to watch it a few times over. This was my determining factor between four and five stars.The special effects, however, were stunning. At least for 1984.If your an abid collector of Sci-Fi, then you probably won't regret adding this to you're collection."
4,Its a good movie but...,Dune is a realy good moive not as good as the book . You must read the book and not rush throu the book. Its not the books fault the moive was made so badly then thay edited it the moive it was so cool when it was 3 in 1/2 hrs long now all i can find is the hour in a half vertion and it suck beause i was 4 or 5 when i sall dune the first time and it rocked now it still rocks i whan to see a full vertion of dune agin and just watch it
5,A good portrait of Dune,"The movie is a little cheesy, but dark and strange enough to be original. The special effects are well done, and the worms look pretty good, the story is fairly consistent with the book too."
4,Not quite there yet,"This version looks better, but then why not wait for the Blu-ray disc in that case..? And as for the Smithee cut: this is a badly slapped together mix of extra materials on top of the original version. If you are a big fan of the movie, like myself, you will definitely enjoy the extra scenes, but I will not recommend it to anyone looking for a coherent narrative or goof-free film.."
3,Dune HD DVD - A bit disappointing,"First off, I am one of those who liked the movie. However, now that I have the HD DVD in hand, I find that I am one who likes the longer version better than the theatrical release.As far as the HD DVD goes, I was a bit disappointed. Not as good of a transfer as I'd hoped.Still glad I have it in my collection, but I'd really like the longer version with a better HD transfer."
1,Disgustingly Terrible,"Dune is my favorite book. This is one of the worst book to movie adaptations I have ever seen. Fans of the book will notice many glaring inaccuracies, the story speeds by in a blur of confusion and everything seems rushed. The Sardaukar uniforms look like the came out of a a childrens' cartoon mixed with a nuclear powerplant. If you like Dune, skip this mess and buy the superior Sci-Fi channel six hour-long epic. If Frank Herbert saw this, he would be disgusted."
2,Buy the book instead.,"If you've heard all of the hype about DUNE and want to experience it for yourself, DON'T get this movie. A lot of it is hard to understand if you haven't read the book first, and there is so much left out of the movie. They could have made the movie 12 hours long, and it still would have been missing stuff.The book is my favorite novel of all time; the movie is something I could have lived without. END"
2,Sacrilege to an epic!,"Ok, I admit I'm kind of a goofball. I knew this ENTIRE movie by heart for over a decade, and when I saw this, I was appalled. I only watched the first 20 mins of it before shutting it off, so my opinion will be short, but heated.The voiceover that was once Virginia Madsen is know some annoying older guy, and quoted Ms. Madsen rather poorly. He did get the year wrong (it's 10191, not 10192 like he said).The handdrawn pics depicting the ""Butlerian Jihad"" were cheesy, which was misnamed the 'Great Revolt'.What killed this movie for me was a severe mix-match of graphics. This is where I have to get into the storyline. When the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohaim was to report to Caladan to meet Paul Atreides, they showed her as a passenger, sitting behind 2 Harkonnen pilots on their ship...flying toward the city of Arakeen on Arakis!!! WTF???That's where I shut it off. Thanks for reading my rant."
5,DUNE (Extended Edition),Excellent movie. Followed the book almost to the letter.Keeps you riveted to the end.Outstanding cinemaphotography.
5,Great movie from a great book,"When i first read the words like ""weird"" or ""bizarre"" in the Amazon.com review of this fine film the first thing that came to mind was ""what are ya talkin' about??"" I thought that this was a very fine film and that David Lynch did a fantastic job with a complicated story that brought many different plots into one novel.The cast is spectacular, Kyle MacLachlan, Sean Young, Sting and Linda Hunt accuratly portray their characters, and the man who played the Baron was incredible.The special effects were great for the time and were pulled off magnificently.This is a great science fiction film, it should not be passed up so quickly, just give it a chance, and if you have a problem with it, read the book and watch the movie again."
2,2 stars cause I like the floating guild dude,"This movie is like reading the first chapter and then a bulleted outline of the rest of the novel.It begins okay, building up Paul and his supporting crew, but about half-way through Lynch kicks it into high gear and we see this one hour montage of highlights with music from Toto. By the time the credits were rolling, I was cringing at this tumbling stack of cards.Go grab the miniseries; it does twice as much with a third of the budget. They actually bothered to show his transformation into Mau'Dib.Also, if you decide to watch this film, please pay attention when they roll out the alien in to the emperor's chambers and a guy on the left side trips and falls...hilarious."
1,as bad as it gets,"Without a doubt one of the worst sci fi movies ever made. A horrible movie. An incomprehensible ""groaner"" to any who loved Herbert's Masterpiece."
4,Ehhh....,"It's interesting, and it makes you want to know what happens next. Although this would have been a better movie if they had focused more on the mystery and less on the action. They try to cram a lot of things in to one movie, the result being it is nearly four hours long. If you watch it without the stuff that makes it four hours long, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. So it gets a bit boring by the end... it seems kind of disorganized and mashed together. It's a good movie to watch when you've got nothing better to do and want to pass the time, though."
3,Before there was Star Wars,"Some fun facts:Dune was written and published in 1965Star Wars was released in 1978Dune the movie was released in 1984I first saw Star Wars in the theaters in 1978 and became hooked to the series.I never watched Dune or read it until recently and this is my take on the whole thing.When I sat down and watched Dune I was surprised by the cheap sets and poor special effects. Star Wars had this movie beat hands down.However, when it comes to the story of Dune: it is a great and amazing plot and adventure. I can now see where George Lucas was inspired for Star Wars.As far as this DVD it has lots of hours of entertainment. You just have to get past some of the cheesy sets and filming.All in all its a good DVD to have in your collection."
1,Amazon rentals fails again,Before I rented Dune it said I was able to download the video to watch on a wifi disabled device. I rented this way because I wanted to watch it while on a plane. Now it seems I can't unless I have an ipad or kindle fire.Yet another example of why iTunes video rentals far surpasses amazon.
2,"Good Movie, Poor DVD Quality","This version of Dune has always been one of my favorites. I've love the imaginative settings and the story line follows the book well, but the video quality of the DVD is very low. It is watchable, but viewed on a big screen TV, it looks like an amateur copy of a VHS tape to DVD."
2,incomplete movie,"I remember watching Dune when I was a kid, and I recently read the book. Overall I wish they had offered a version where they placed the deleted scenes back in because the movie would have made a lot more sense. overall the HD looks pretty good for the desert scenes but you can really see how far we have come for digital effects."
1,Not even close!,"I can't believe some of the reviews for this piece of trash that I've read here. Did any of those people actually READ the book? Apparently not, or phrases like ""true to the book"" and ""author's vision"" would never have been written. About the only things this movie has in common with the book are the character and place names, everything else is completely different. It's pretty clear that David Lynch didn't read the book, either.A far, far better treatment is the mini-series John Harrison directed that played on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2000, starring William Hurt and Alex Newman. An extended Director's Cut (in widescreen) is available and is even better. Don't waste your time with Lynch's disaster, get Harrison's version and enjoy a movie that really does remain true to Frank Herbert's epic novel. Harrison also directed ""Children Of Dune"" for Sci-Fi and it is very good, too."
3,"Oh crap, it's a classic - Part One","it must be said...Oh crap, it's a classic. Have to make this short as just about to watch a katey hepburn classic on tv - this is a film I've seen several times, twice at cinema, several times on tv and video also 1/2 times on dvd.This time I will deal with te accusation of weak blacks in the dvd transfer (no, not a racial issue).In the ""making of dune"" by ed naha, the DOP stated that it was his intention that there be no true blacks in his film....always browny blacks. If you've ever seen this at the cinema you'll realise this was so.Will continue soon, must get back to kate.Doc"
1,Now I know why only $3.99,"I should have known the price was way to low. Looks like they are trying to unload these on the uninformed consumer. It is my fault for assuming that this would play on my Blu Ray player, now I know better. So, if you do not have the HD player, don't even bother with this DVD."
1,Save Your Money,"So awful you have to laugh to keep from crying. The dialogue is almost impossible to listen to, the acting is wooden and at times ridiculous, and the special effects are very, very dated. It reminded me of the old ""Lost in Space"" TV program, and that isn't good."
1,Very disappointed,"The story is very childish, and not much imagination I saw in the story setting.All concepts appear are pretty old, not mention the plot is ridiculous."
2,Rent it,"This is not a very good adaptation of the novel, so if you are a purist you will be disappointed."
1,So bad it's not even good,"The most interesting thing about this movie is that you can see how George Lucas ripped off the original book, 'Dune' by Frank Herbert, for his 'Star Wars' series. By the time Lucas gets to filming 'The Phantom Menace,' he has graduated to David Lynch's level of making sci-fi movies like 'Dune.' These kind of movies are filled with sword fighting, endless expository monologues, stilted dialogue, worries over economic warfare and pained attempts to invoke classical and religious themes. This movie shows Kyle Machlan teaching ragtag sand dwellers how to tear apart stone by making resonating sounds with their voices. Oh, and it has big worms."
1,This movie is TERRIBLE!,This movie is terrible on so many levels it is hard to do it justice here. The acting is terrible. The story is terrible. The special effects are terrible. Fans of the book will hate it because it completely departs from the book. People who do not know the book will hate it because only someone who has read the book can even fathom watching it in the first place.Anyone who sees depth and meaning in this movie is intellectually masturbating. Save your money. Do not buy this DVD. Buy the Sci-Fi Mini-Series Version. I can only hope this review saves at least one person the pain of seeing this rendition of Dune.
1,How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways.......,"Lynch, Sting, giants worms, a prologue spoken in a Russian/Latin combination......where do I begin? Incomprehensible, dull, pointless, mind-numbing, banal, utterly contemptable.....in other words, the sort of film that is impossible to enjoy if one is sane, rational, and intellectually sound. You stand warned: viewings may cause extreme drowsiness and suicidal contemplations."
3,"Great movie, horrible transfer","I just watched the blu-ray version of Dune, and I have to say there is nothing special about this release vs. the normal DVD release. Same sound, same graphics. I was hoping for a nice remastering of the content, but I guess we will have to wait for David Lynch to approve some sort of special version.If you have the DVD version, wait, and do not pick this up. If you have never watched the Dune movie before, grab some popcorn and enjoy and excellent story and adventure."
1,Worse than the Baron himself.,"Other than the total inaccuracies in the entire thing, and how nothing was explained, leaving anyone who hasn't read the book clueless. (Hell I studied the book and I'm still quite confused as to how things happened) They did not spend NEARLY enough time showing Fremen culture, or the struggles Paul and Jessica went through post-attack. I did not feel connected to anyone in any way, so when a character reappeared, or was in danger, I was like ""nah man i don't even care"".Overall this movie was complete garbage. If you have read the book and are debating watching this movie I wouldn't, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you haven't read the book, go read the book and never watch this movie."
4,Fun flick,"The movie retains most of the original story. It was fun to watch, and learn that I was correctly pronouncing the names from the book."
3,Almost Good enough,"This version is adequate if you haven't read Dune. Dune is too complex a novel to portray in 137 minutes. I have seen the long version on Sci Fi (Not the TV Version) and it fills in more gaps that the Dune enthusiast is expecting to see. Even still the I find it could be expanded more. The original director refuses to be associated with the longer version; a mistake,The TV version has filled in most of those gaps but made some ""changes"" for which I can still not rationalize why (Nowhere do they use his fremen name Usul?)I recomend you buy them both, and if you are lucky enough, record the long version whenever SciFi runs it again."
2,"If I get eaten by a worm, I won't have to watch this . . .","There are different ways to approach a subject as complex as Dune:You can either take the time to tell the story properly, which requires either a mini-series or a series of movies (a la Lord of the Rings). You can also boil the story down to the bare minimum and tell a very basic story, or you can do what they attempted to do here, which was to take the entire story and compress it into two hours.The end result, of course is similar to flying over Disneyland. Sure, you get an idea of what's going on, but you miss actually experiencing it.Dune is like that. Huge chunks of narrative exposition and brief, shallow storytelling that doesn't have the time to explore anything in depth.Save yourself. Read the books."
5,Dune,Dune is an awsome saga put to video. Not much deviation from the novel saga. Very well directed as well as casted. You will notice some familar faces. You will enjoy this movie if you are any kind of a sci fi fan.
5,this is my reference for other sci-fi`s,Who said it`s all about special effects in sf movies?I think this is a good example with a story to go for I watched it again and again always discover more about the movie. I placed it right beside the star trek collection on the shelf.
2,Dawn of the Morning,Not one of GLH's better efforts. This is a silly story with very few spiritual elements.
2,So Far,"Haven't finished reading this book yet, but it does not appear like any of her other books. Appears a little depressing here. Maybe it will get better. Nothing written yet regarding God and HIs will. Now that I've said all that, maybe I will get back into it and find Him written somewhere in the story. As of now, Dawn just got married. We'll see."
5,Excellent Service,"The item was to my satisfaction, quick service (got it within 5 days) and safely packed. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of product."
2,BPA Free but poor design,"I bought these bottles because they are an inexpensive BPA free option. However, I am very disappointed. There are 5 parts (6 if you include the lid) to this bottle. If not put together just right, they leak! The bottom of this bottle screws on. It has 2 parts. The liner must be put in the bottle just right and then screwed on tight. The nipple must be pulled all the way through (you'd think that'd be easy to tell, huh). If either of these areas aren't put together right, WATCH OUT! Oh, and be careful trying to tighten one end while holding the other. Nothing like a lap full of liquid!One other thing, this bottle takes longer to warm than other bottles whose bottoms aren't as bulky.I would not buy this bottle again. There are other alternatives that are much easier (and BPA free) for a busy Mom to use."
3,Too many bubbles...,"I bought these bottles as an alternative to all the bottles containing BPA. I read customer reviews and decided to go with these. Contrary to what other have written, these bottles' venting system doesn't work properly. I have assembled and reassembled several times to make sure I have it right. My 6 month old daughter has to unlatch to let air in. If I put my ear up to the bottom I can here the air going in the vent, but I guess it's not enough. Other than this I love these bottles. It's a great idea behind the design, but it just doesnt work. Before I got these, I picked up some cheap Gerber Fashion Tints bottles (3-pack) for $2 and they work better than these."
5,AWESOME!,"We switched to these bottles after baby #2 and BPA issues. We had previously used Avent and Dr. Browns.pro's:wider nipple I think would be good for nipple confusion issues (but we bought after I had finished breast feeding, so I am not sure)easy to clean (compared to Dr. Browns - these are a dream)little to no leaking it you put it together well and screw it on tightlyno gas to hurt the tummyno leaking when you mix formula in the bottle and it holds 9 ounces, so mixing in the bottle in easy (can't do this with Dr Browns)I can't think of any negatives. After using two other popular brands, we love these bottles!"
4,Searched long & hard...,"I researched quite a while to find a BPA-free bottle that was not glass & had a nipple that would be a good transition for my breastfed baby (it has different stage nipples). This was the best I found. The only thing I don't like about it is the vent system - that is, if you don't put the bottom ring in there just right, it may leak. That, of course, also makes cleaning a bit of a pain, compared to non-vented bottles. But, if it helps with gas or colic, it's worth it. I like that they come in the cute colors, as a sidenote. I did go to a different website to find free shipping on the stage 1 nipples though - shipping cost more than the product! Note that these bottles come with stage 2. You can use other brand's nipples, too, if you like the bottles but baby doesn't like the nipples."
3,"Love the bottles, hate the colors","The color combination on these bottles is really very ugly in person. I was so disappointed. I was anticipating that it was two pink bottles with a green bottle, but they are actually purple middles with pink top & bottom, and yellow middle with a green top & bottom. Would be much better if they were just the solid colors, like I thought they were going to be. Otherwise, I love the bottles. My daughter went from breastfeeding straight to these bottles without a problem."
2,not so great,"I was surprised that I did not like these bottles at all, considering the overall positive reviews. I found them to leak excessively from the base, and could not figure out the magic trick to get it to stop. In addition, the milk dribbles out of the nipple, so if the bottle gets knocked over not only a mess, but also a waste of hard pumped milk! I don't know if the constant dribble is to resemble let down??? Anyway, would not recommend."
2,a lot of work,"Well first off these tended to be leaky. The bottom had to be screwed on super tight not to leak, then it would be difficult to unscrew to clean. And it must be unscrewed everytime you wash it or milk gets caught in it. Also my son didn't take to the nipples. So we used the avent w/these, but though the avent appeared to fit, they often leaked by the nipple w/the avent nipples. Perhaps if your baby likes these nipples and you don't mind the bottom part then they would work for you. Oh yeah I bought them to save looking for a cheaper bpa free bottle w/a wide neck. I think I should have just gone w/the Born Free to start with =)!"
1,Not very useful,"As an avid collector and player of the d20 Star Wars system, I found the Living Force Campaign Guide very dissapointing. I thought that it would point me in the direction of getting involved with the RPGA, or at least explain how it works. Instead, there are only two pages in the back on it with a few web addresses. I still don't know how it works.The rest of the book is a very dry, vague desciption of the Cularin system. The system is so broad and generic that any reasonable GM should be able to re-create the same thing with a pencil and piece of paper. Its obvious that the authors wanted the system to be able to fit into any campaign at any time, but that makes it just to generic.In summary, don't bother buying this supplement if you are looking for material for your RPG game."
2,Bland,"Note that this is not a hardcover, and I don't think it ever was.Lots of info on a campaign setting for the rpg, but for only this one system. Star Wars is about a broad galaxy."
4,Good source material,"This supplement is from a now ended ""Living"" roleplaying game event. This provides really good back stories for gamemasters and players alike to be able to play in the Living Force campaign setting. I liked it a lot."
2,Not quite enough,"This book has a lot of interesting information for a beginning Jedi characters. But the book doesn't have much to add to a character that wants to grow. It might help a roleplayer to better play a jedi, but there is little to improve simple game mechanics."
2,Have a good dictionary ready,"This is a decent book. I was truly excited about reading it. I was particularly fascinated by the author's use of the paradoxes of Jefferson's words and deeds.However, I found it hard to read due to the author's needlessly pretentious word choice. My appetence for consummating the reading of this tome was stymied by a repetitious exigence to avail myself of a dictionary due to polysyllabic profundity. ;-)"
2,Better Biographies Elsewhere,"I found it rather difficult to finish this rather long book. (422 pages not including endnotes and index). Length, however, was not what made it difficult. For some reason Alf J. Mapp believes it necessary to use difficult language at nearly every turn when such language is not necessary. I consider myself an above average reader and I must say that I struggled all the way through. The book would have been far more enjoyable had Mapp conversed in a style more acceptable to those of us who aren't quite up to his education level.His use of language, quite frankly, makes his biography quite boring. Unless you're a collector of Jefferson books as I am, I would recommend getting your biography elsewhere."
2,"Reprint of a 1987 book, under a different title","This is a paperback reprint of ""Thomas Jefferson: a strange case of mistaken identity"" by Alf Mapp, from 1987. Why on earth the publisher chose to change the title is a great (and extremely frustrating) mystery, earning it a miserly 2 star rating for causing so much confusion."
4,Calvin's Global Impact,"Unfortunately. we have been robbed of our rich biblical heritage in the founding of America. In particular, John Calvin played a critical role. It was his theology that helped to fuel the break with England and their tyrant king. But Calvin's ideas also played a major role in other aspects of culture that impacted the whole world. Meeker gives an overview of some of those ideas in his book. His presentation is very straightforward and clear. I highly recommend getting this book and investigating the truth about the major impact that Calvin had on the world.The Emergence of Liberty in the Modern World: The Influence of Calvin on Five Governments from the 16th Through 18th CenturiesThe Legacy of John Calvin: His Influence on the Modern World (Calvin 500)John Calvin's American LegacyThe Genevan Reformation and the American Founding"
5,"The movie was not changed, the picture quality was good, it came quickly and the price was great!",The above says everything I need to say. I assume if you purchase this you are familiar with the movie.
5,Bing At His Best!,"Bing and Barry turn in a fantastic performance. If you enjoy this film, you'll love them in ""Welcome Stranger"". It's the original that ""Doc Hollywood"" was based on. Bing and Barry are perfect on screen together."
5,"Quality acting, a solid story line, and (of course) stellar music.","One of Bing's best - I would recommend it without reservation to anyone. One of the most delightful things about this film for me was the quality of the acting; the dialogue was minimal in some places but the body language and facial expressions made up for it. I was laughing out loud often in appreciation, which doesn't happen with great frequency. If you're looking for a story of gentle, perseverant kindness winning the day, this is it."
5,Going My Way,This is a movie I can watch over and over again.I first saw it when I was a little boy. This movie always gives me a wonderful feeling. This is the kind of movie I want to have. Amazone made this possible with a good price. The movie got to me on time and in good gondition.
5,Does work well,"A fob from Toyota would have cost me $140.00 plus $50.00 to program it. The Amazon Fob was $50.00, big savings. The programming information paper that came with the Fob was for a Toyota truck and not car, but it worked anyway. I am very happy with the Fob."
5,Worst bombing of a public building until Oklahoma City,"Two days before Charles Lindbergh flew the Atlantic the bombing of a school took place in Bath, Michigan. On May 18, 1927, a deranged killer by the name of Andrew Kehoe attempted to kill as many children and adults by dynamite explosives planted in the Bath schoolhouse. His success was thwarted when only half of the dynamite exploded. The events leading up to the ""Bath School Disaster"" are well documented by the author Grant Parker. The story of mid-America in the 1920's is chronicled in a accurate and informative way by the author, as he presents a way of life that was disrupted for many families for a lifetime. I have a special interest in this book because both my mother and my uncle were in in the other half of the school that did not blow up on that Mayday. For more than seventy years the survivors of the disaster have met in the Spring of each year to continue their survival bonding with each other."
4,A must read about Lakota Medicine.,This is a fine book about the life of Peter Catches. I read this book to learn more about NAtive American medicine people and to see their gifts and connection with Spirit. This book is a good addition to any Native library and makes a great gift for anybody with native interests. This is a must read for anyone studying Native medicine. You will not be disappointed.
2,not what i thought,I have an old LP album of the same title as this Cd and with the same photo of Fats on the cover that I consider excellant. I thought this Cd was that album but its not- not even close. Very disapointing.
4,Royal Hunt's Best Album,"Royal Hunt were formed in Denmark around 1992 by Andre Anderson, a very talented keyboardist and a native of Moscow. After two albums the original vocalist Henrik Brockman departed and American vocalist DC Cooper was brought into the band. His vocal ability was definitely a step up and it shows on this album full of great melodies and well-written songs. My favorite songs are 1348, Far Away, Step By Step, Autograph (instrumental), Stay Down, and Time. By 1999's album, Fear, DC Cooper was out of the band replaced by John West. If you are looking for a very talented band that write great music you should check out Royal Hunt."
4,A Charming Moment,"What a CHARMING romance...an ENGAGING cast of characters...an INTRIGUING storyline...with quite a few ENDEARING and funny moments...that kept me turning the pages throughout...it also has some WONDERFUL little life lessons...about HEALTH, following your DREAMS, FAITH and TRUST...I also LOVE the fact that Melody has secretly had a crush on Grant since college and she just CAN'T seem to shake it...BUT will Melody ever TRUST Grant or herself in matters of the heart...and will Grant FINALLY realize there's more to life than work before it's too late...a SWEET treat and I'm looking forward to reading more from Mrs. Bourne-Williams."
3,Interesting Moment,"This is the first book that I have read by Phyllis Bourne Williams, and basically I liked it.Either she did some serious research, or she is really familiar with the finance/investing industry.There was only one thing that flawed this book: The imagery. I could never develop a mental picture in my mind of the scenery in the book. And, I was born in Tennessee, and spent most of my summers there as a child. So, I was really disappointed when Phyllis Bourne Williams did not paint a vivid picture of the places where the characters lived.And, I've never been to Boston, so she really needed to draw a good description of that city.If it were not for the lack of descriptions in the book I would probably give her 4-stars."
5,Poodle Dress,I bought this item for a 50s birthday party. This item was very prettyand the guality of the dress for the money was excellent. I would buyagain. It one first prize at the party.
1,Returned this costume,"This costume was awful - I turned right around and returned it. I am 5'4"", size 10, and ordered this in a Large. The top was a bit snug (I usually wear a medium top) but the bottom was so big and extremly unflattering. The skirt made my hips look like it was a foot rounder than it really is. Had I known how to sew, I would have thought about keeping it and making some alterations but I'm not that domestic (unfortunately)."
5,Almost a Disney Channel Christmas,"I remember the Christmas special that came on the Disney Channel in the 1980's (When the Disney Channel was worth watching.) I can't find the complete special but if you buy this movie and A Walt Disney Christmas you have the whole special. It is too bad that you have to buy two movies though and that it isn't on DVD, but I gave it 5 stars anyway because I love watching these videos at Christmas time."
3,"Eh, Ripoff.","I haven't listened to this cd THAT much. I give them credit for having talent, but they basically stole their talent from Glassjaw. The leader sounds like an exact ripoff of Daryl. Oh well I guess."
4,Kylie's music,Another obscure artist. At least here in the states. Not many know her now. The disc is in great shape. Plays well. Try it for yourself.
3,Good resource book,Good resource book. Lots of postal history and detail on old U.S. stamps. But also lots of spelling errors that could have been prevented with a good editor.
1,Looks Like a kids purse,"Not a fan of this purse. It looks really cute online, but when I got it, it didn't look good at all. It looks like something I would buy for my 4 year old to play with (and I sure as heck wouldn't pay over $10 for it!)The color on the straps and borders are leather (or pleather) and do not match the color pink on the suede.I am returning this item."
2,could have been so much better...,i was overjoyed to see a biography on basquiat finally in print. however i was sorely disappointed in the product itself. ms. hoban talks around basquiat through the majority of the book as opposed to talking about him. also there is a great deal of condescension directed at the subject by the author. ms. hoban seems to have researched her subject thoroughly. but her account has glaring inconsistencies with previously published biographical material. which she neglects to even address. let alone clear up.
1,heresay,Not a bad read...but not a factual one either. The movie nor the book provide the reality of the Jean Michel Basquiat story. Enjoy it as gossip filled fiction literature.
4,Nice book there should be more out there!,"I liked to read about Black Painters that changed the way people think. Mr. Basquiat was one of the talented people in recent art history and still is at the auction house(because of drugs). Since, there is little written on other Black artists, we have to take what we are given. There are many artist out there that are of color, working away at there craft. But, there needs to be more written about them. There are no reviews about them and it seems that when one is talked about, they are a freak of nature and should be worshiped. This book is a good one, it talks about gossip and life in Soho. One takes what he or she can get."
1,a horrible book!!!,"when i first heard of this book coming out i was really excited, not knowing much about the artist beyond his relationship with warhol. after reading this book it looks like the author didnt know much about the artist either."
3,Worth the read,"The best thing about this book was the last chapter when someone must have realized, ""Wow, I guess we should talk a little about his art and creative process."" A lot of the rest of the book is about girlfriends, drug experiences, etc. I think a lot of this could have been edited out. There was also a lot about the 80's art business and dealers and I thought that was pretty interesting. But I was looking for more of what it's really all about for me - the art and the process. One thing I took from it is that Basquiat worked hard before his last couple years; he was constantly drawing and painting and processing. Regardless as to whether he was on drugs or not, he did the work. And no one can take that away from him. And I think his work kicks ass."
2,"Good book, He think.","Don't look to this work for any information about Basquiat as an artist. This is a book about fame. It took Ms. Hoban 7 years to write about an artist whose career wasn't even that long. This is a book about the eighties, fame, and excess. You will not learn much about Jean-Michel by reading this book. You will learn about the climate of the eighties art world and the ever-present parasites that the enormous speculation over great artists can create(Braghoomian for instance). The photographs of Jean-Michel are interesting, but because of the ownership of the artist's works, none are present to look at while reading this work. Buy a book of Basquiat's work if you are interested in the artist. If you are interested in the vacuum of New York 1980's culture, check this out at the library--it's not worth purchasing."
3,Should have known....,"While comprehensive and extremely detailed, I found this book disappointing because all the images of Cezanne's masterpieces are in black & white. As Dr. Barnes was extremely discriminating as to who saw his collection--I should have know known he would never publish 'his' images to be viewed by the public."
2,Warning. The art is black & white,"Given his extraordinary view as to how the collection should be viewed, I should have realized a book of this age, co authored by Dr. Barnes, and his protoge, Ms Mazia would not be in color."
5,Glad to finally find this text,"After reading this book as a third-grader, it stayed with me all my life. Now as a 40-year-old High School English Teacher and soon to be Media Specialist, I was delighted to finally find my very own copy of this wonderful story of a pet's unconditional love, which earns him a rainbow colored halo and the title of ""Maximal saint."" Another juvenile text called Leo the Magnificat is a non-fiction based story about a similar church cat."
2,"If They were Metallica it would be called ""LOAD""....","This is perhaps the worst album of the year. I had high hopes, but upon first listen I discovered this album really lacked everything previous albums had. Even ""CLAYMAN"" which I also thought was a very horrible album beats this. It's main problem is its not In Flames. It sounds like some Nu-Metal band trying to be something their not. I do like Nu-Metal, but In Flames isn't that type. They never have been, and they shouldn't have changed. They made a big mistake with this album. They also created a void in fans with this album. Even if their next album were back to basics it wouldn't be able to save this fan. I like change, but I like change for the better."
1,Sad....,"I bought the CD. I listened to it. I sold it. Why?--- The vocals are 80% clean, soft spokened however mixed with some decent fretwork. This did not make one such as myself very thrilled. I don't buy records to hear someones emotions or try to relate to their pain--I buy for entertainment and basic sound. This sounds bad."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!,"How could you let them do this?? In Flames = sellouts. Listen to songs like the title track and ""Cloud Connected"" or any of the ballads. Then listen to anything from ""Whoracle"" or ""Colony"". Hard to believe it's the same guys. In Flames has officially made their transition from melodic death metal messiahs to the ""next big thing"". The comparisons to Metallica are right!!Whoracle/Jester Race/Colony= KEA/RTL/MOPClayman= AJFARtR= Black/Load/Reload"
1,BOOOOO!!!!!!!,This album is garbage. I love in flames and i can't find anything nice to say about this album except that when thrown from a moving car it flies really nice and shatters into a million pieces!
2,I dont get it,"I used to love in flames... Back when Whoracle was new I was listening to it constantly. Then Colony was just as awesome. Then Clayman was awesome too... but granted not their best. Now I think their popularity has overcome them. To be honest with you, I think they are trying to sound like Soilwork on this album; and do it poorly. And whats with all the ... quiet clean vocals? They sound awful. ... If you heard this cd and didnt know it was In Flames, you'd probably say it [wasn't good]. Bad CD; not In Flames. VERY DISSAPOINTING"
4,Not their best but still deserves to be listened to.,"Reroute to Remain is definitely not In Flames best. Even though, it is not a total loss either. I don't believe they sold out to become a nu-metal band either. Instead, I like to think this cd as a mix of Gothenburg thrash (or neo-thrash if you prefer), a little industrial metal, and just a tad of nu-metal. I said a tad of nu-metal, I'm not implying that this is NOT a nu-metal cd. Anyway, this definitely different from their past work but not a bad listen. I, myself like it because it is a little different and the melody, even though somewhat different too, is darn good to listen to. So you might want to give this one a couple or so spins before you decide it isn't any good."
5,Not the best by In Flames but still gets 5 stars,"Whereas this may not be the best by In flames, it certainley is worthy of their stamp, you can call it nu metal all you want, but it sure isnt, cause this sounds WAAAAAYYY better than slipknot. So collect some stars to shine for you and get this album, in the often used concert ending words of In flames themselves, May the Force be with you."
2,Dissapointing And Generic,"In Flames has officially lost their touch. WIth this album, they moved themselves into the generic mainstream metal genre, and in doing so, turned themselves into ""just another"" band. Though Cloud Connected is a pretty good song, the rest of the album is dull and monotone, with a few extra notes here and there. I loved every album they made before this one, and I've hated every album after it. A true shame."
5,Amazing,"Always a huge In Flames fan but this album sent me over the edge. They do what they do better than anyone else. Killswitch Engage? No, get this CD it's amazing."
3,Is this really In Flames?,"I don't know.... it's not bad, it's not good... It's just different.I can't really get IN to the new sound after becoming an In Flames fan from their previous works such as Whoracle or Jester Race.Maybe if you're a new listener, and are interested in picking up some In Flames, go ahead and get this album, it'd be a good way to get you started."
4,Damn Good Album,"I had never heard of In Flames before a couple of weeks ago. I heard the opening keyboard/guitar riff to the song Cloud Connected, and I thought it was the best riff I had heard in years. I am NOT a fan of death metal and I am extremely ignorant of In Flames' previous albums, but from a musical perspective, this is quite a peice of work. I usually listen to Dream Theater, Rush, Queensryche, etc... so I am used to singing more than screaming. I really like this CD though. Even though the singer screams, you can still hear the melody behind the scream, if that makes any sense. In terms of musicianship and talent, I strongly recommend this CD, and if you can get past the screaming, it is a must have for all progressive metal fans. I am intrigued by this band's previous CDs because all of you seem to like those better, so I will definitely check them out. I do not think this sounds like nu-metal AT ALL!"
5,THE NEW IN FLAMES,"Ok,first of all,this is a amazing cd,very experimental,and brilliant,second of all,WHERE THE F**K do people come up with,that is is Nu Metal,this is not nu-metal,grow up people,the band took a change,deal with it,but anyways,a great cd,buy it."
5,an absolutely fantastic album!,"ever since i picked up "" Colony "" from IN FLAMES i was astounded how talented this band is. two albums later they have only gotten better and with "" Reroute to remain "" have created a masterpiece. although their earlier work is much darker and more death metal oriented, i think the last 3 have given them their own identity. "" Reroute to remain "" has shown the versatility of vocalist Anders Friden which has given IN FLAMES more ammunition for the future that they didnt use previously. the rest of the band still continue to improve musically are probably the best aside from the guys in ARCH ENEMY. if there ever were a metal album to return metal to the glory days it is "" Reroute to remain ""."
4,Don't like In Flames?,"As an owner of every album In Flames has made, I can't say this one is less impressive than any other. As for the reviewer who said he doesn't buy albums ""to hear someone's emotions or try to relate to their pain"" -- well, FYI, that's what music is often about. Musicians are supposed to be emotional rather than cold. If their music reflects their experiences in life, so be it. They should communicate passion for something, some kind of intense feeling(s) - otherwise their artistry could be considered fake. If that's the case, they might as well go find a job that requires nothing more than robotic monotony. If you don't find their music entertaining, that's fine. Don't listen to it. Buy some other group's albums. In Flames won't care. After all, if you've seen one of their shirts, on the front it asks: ""Don't like In Flames?"" The back reads ""Eat a bag of (four-letter expletive for feces)."""
2,who produced this!!!!,"I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews for this album because I was pretty disappointed when I heard it. I'm not a fan of nu metal and to me, that's what it sounds like. I don't think In flames are selling out or anything like that I think they were simply experimenting. What ruins this album for me is purely the way its been produced. The catchy melodies typical of In Flames are still present but it seems they've been put into the back ground and a thrashy nu metal guitar rhythm overpowers them in the foreground. I find myself straining my ears to hear the real music. Its a bit of a shame really - I think it could have been a really good album. Having said that, the track Metaphor is a little bit different, very interesting and worth checking out."
3,Not up to standard,"This is not the In-Flames I remember for such masterpieces as Colony, Clayman and Whoracle which were the defining hour for the now infamous Gothenburg sound.I think It cannot be denied that they were trying to crack a new nut with this release, the songs are more accessible and chorus based, it's not nu-metal but It's defiantly is more mainstream.On the whole I didn't like it, the production is very muddy and the music is slightly confused edging in keyboards (which I like) but it didn't work with the overall sound. It lacked the heavy punching guitars with the usual creative melodic edge, partly due to the production but also due to the fact that they were looking for something more formulaic for the mainstream market.I give it 3 stars because it's In-Flames and their is the occasional burst of magic of old but overall this is weak.Whoever it was that said 'Reroute to remainstream' was correct, I don't remember seeing 100+ reviews for Whoracle or Colony, I rest my case."
1,What a let down...,"Ive been into In Flames since the day ""The Jester Race"" came out, so I can proudly say they have been my favorite band..up until 9/3/02. Holy ... Batman, what a load of donkey doo-doo. I can honestly say this is not the old, good In Flames we used to know and love. Gone are teh uplifting melodies that used to be stuck in your head for days...replaced with some of the worst singing I have ever heard. His growling vocals are still jsut as good, but the clean vocals remind me of.. *shudder* Jonathan Davis of KoRn. The music is a bit heavier than previous albums, but that is becasue the melodies have been pretty much scrapped, and there are 3 or 4 solos on teh whole album, the weakest the band has ever done. If you are new to this band..please dont get this..get one of the masterpieces before The Jester Race, Colony, or Whoracle."
2,Doesn't even seem like In Flames,"I love just about every In Flames album except this one. Compared to my other favorites such as Episode 666, Clayman, Jotun, etc etc, these songs are horrible. This is just the opinion of myself and under 10 other Flames fans that I've talked to, so maybe we're in the minority. I do like Minus and Cloud Connected though. It only gets 2 stars overall from me though."
1,In Flames=Sellout +Nu-Metal kids,"This CD is like a diesease that has no cure. Firstly the music is nothing like the real In Flames I listened to when I first became a fan in 1995,they just keep getting worse instead of better. I'm sorry I will still listen to Lunar Strain and Whoracle but you lost another fan."
2,Total...,"What an extreme disappointment. In Flames was one of the only bands I could count on to consistently put out good music... I guess that has come to an end with this ... of an album. They seem to be following in the the footsteps of another formerly good band, Amorphis.(If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out Tales from the Thousand Lakes, then check out Tuonela). There's terrible, at times laughable (non-death) vocals, rarely any decent guitar work, and mostly just the same tired, uninspired metal riffs we've heard a hundred times over. And that's not considering the corny ... lyrics (which you can now understand), poorly done keyboards and other annoying, terrible sounding ... that's thrown in there for good measure."
2,"alright, but doesnt match to their previous work","all and all this is a decent album , but doesnt come close to the meoldic and heavy songs on colony, clayman, or whoracle , (my favorite in flames albums). this album just goes a little too mainstream and lacks some of the melodic, original solos that are on the previous albums. its almost like evry song sounds the same with a lame chorus added to it. Dont get me wrong, i love in flames and cant wait until their new album comes out, but i just hope its heavier and more melodic metal we have seen on their pervious works before R2R."
2,buy another In Flames CD,"this disc is NOTHING compared to ""The Jester Race"", ""Whoracle"", and ""Colony"". im not saying that because i dont like the new sound (i like ""Soundtrack to Your Escape"", also), im just saying it because this album has 3 good songs...and thats all.Standout tracks: ""Trigger"" - one of the band's best songs (the album version is much better than the single version)""Reroute to Remain""""Cloud Connected"" - i like the remix on the ""Trigger"" single better, though"
4,not their best,"before this cd, in flames used to be, my favorite (well almost my favorite) band. but, this cd, kinda was a downfall for them. they made this music on the cd nu-metal, and i hate nu-metal!!!! i have to addmit though, there are some standouts on the cd like trigger, and black and white. but, of course there is also some sucky songs like cloud connected, and metaphor. metaphor especially, sux a**. but anyway, this cd is ok.until next time, bb and mp, u can im me at mysticyautja if you wish :-)"
4,"A different In Flames, but just as good!","Those who are familiar with Jester Race and Colony, may or may not like the new sound of In Flames. There is a different style of singing and instrumentals in this album, although from a musical standpoint, it's only slightly different. I gave this CD four stars because it is far from their best work, but this is In Flames. My favorite songs are 'Reroute to Remain', System, 'Cloud Connected', the melancholic 'Dawn of a New Day' and the moody song 'Minus'. These are the standout tracks. I only hope they perform up to my expectations on their upcoming tour with Sentenced and Dark Tranquillity. I can't wait! Although this album is far from their best, their new style is almost refreshing. Yet, they have definitely drifted away from fellow melodic-death giants Dark Tranquillity musically."
2,A great dissapointment,"I used to be a In Flames fan, but where are the double guitarmelodies and the cool structures. These are hits who are easily to listen to but none of them are any interesting or fun and they sound very similar. Buy something else."
5,Another masterpiece from In Flames.,"The best metal album of 2002. In Flames put on another great record. It might not be in the same style as the previous records, but it is equally very good. Every song on this album has it's own character. In Flames is the best metal band on the market today. By the way, also a great show to see."
2,What Happened?,"What in frikkin hell happened? They are such sellouts, especially now they released the Trigger single with the new song 'watch them feed'. Thats a totally nu-metal song. I liked Clayman, I don't know why people bash it, it was a departure from their sound, but still was Swedish death metal. My favorite is still Whoracle. I only gave this 2 stars cause I still liked some songs on it, like Trigger."
2,Weak!!!,"This album put the classic heavy In Flames to shame. The clean vocals are much too poppy to be anything this band would put out. The music isn't wild enough either. I must agree with the aforementioned Dark album analogy. This is not black metal, simply put. People who do like intense death/black shouldn't look here, or even on Clayman for that matter. It's too bad they had to sellout and go for the masses instead of where they were truly appreciated. Fans of this album should check out Killswitch Engage, other pop-metal."
3,Dissapointing,"This album sounds nothing at all like In Flames. It is decent album, but it contains none of those remarkable Swedish-styled melodies which are instead replaced by repetitive power chords, whined vocals and sloppy song structures. A few songs are pretty good, but not good enough to warrant any more than 3 stars ( I especially like the slow song with the folk-inspired violin and clean singing. Very nice.)"
4,Another Fine Attack,"Great Riffs, Good Melodies... Just what we would expect from IN FLAMES. Maybe not as much catchy melody interlacing throughout the songs, but fast and heavy as always.I only have some minor complaints: more guitar solos. And what's up with the clean vocals ? We didn't hear those before and we wern't missing anything ! It's a bit annoying to find that kind of immitation of bands like Soilwork and Dark Tranquillity. Those bands are excellent in their own merit, but they are no IN FLAMES. In some ways I feel they have fallen back a few steps incorporating those, becoming more like the rest and not so much like the best.I would like to hear longer instrumental pieces in the songs, not necessarily an instrumental song. Take a couple points from CHILDREN OF BODOM."
5,Best Metal Album of the Year.,"In Flames deliver another great masterpiece.In Flames introduces a listener to the new techniques of metal, and at the same time keep the nostalgia of the 80s & 90s."
3,Ok at best,"When I bought Reroute to Remain, I expected another classic In Flames release. In Flames has become the standard for Swedish metal across the world, and I expected the follow up to Clayman to be [great]...it wasn't. This release is okay at best. The classic In Flames sound in songs such as Episode 666, or Ordinary story is gone. The wild guitar solos take a back seat to cheesy keyboards. Anders experiments with clean vocals, which isnt a bad thing. I happened to like the clean vocals on Pinball Map, but the vocals are dulled by the use of too many effects. I was overall dissapointed with this release."
1,THE oasis?,"This is not Noel Gallagher, but instead a large pile of poo. i thought it was a bootleg or something...but no!"
1,"ehh, new sound?",I never knew Noel Gallagher had influences from Stephen Bucchus and Ron Corb. Very interesting.
4,"not *the* Great American Novel, but pretty good nonetheless","The plot may be a little absurd, but the characters are endearing and the writing is good. It's nothing heavy hitting, but it is fun. It made me laugh out loud quite a few times, too. Like the author writes in the preface, which, as he suggests, you should really read after you read the book, the book is simply meant to entertain. It is ""fluff"" in the best sort of way imaginable. Still, it does manage to have its poignant and philosophical moments. I definitely recommend it as your reading diversion."
4,The book is excellent,"I loved reading the Great American Novel or Random Start by Eliot Stafford. I was initially inquisitive about the cover art, as it seemed a bit strange, but soon found out it's meaning while reading the book. I feel that the characters are colorful, and the book presents highly vivid imagery of a somewhat demented nature. I was highly amused and could not put the book down I was drawn in completely after reading the third chapter. After reading it once I had to read it again, and again. The characters still make me crack up. Being from Kansas I find that I can relate well to the authors descriptions. I found this book is unlike anything else that I have read with multiple plot turns and surprises. Each one would either make me chuckle or bust out into hysterical laughter. I would definitely recommend this book."
5,A kid's book with lots of information.,My teen-aged son is fascinated by all things Russian. I wanted to get him a book that wasn't too little kiddie but also one that wasn't a slog to read through. This book is a children's book but it has lots of pictures and enough information to keep a teen or adult interested. My son has several books in the Eyewitness series and they're consistently good books. Eyewitness Russia is no exception.
2,Misleading title...for an Eyewitness book,"Having purchased several Eyewitness books in the past, this book is very sketchy, just a basic history....on a grade school level.The seller got it to me promptly and in good condition, but I was disappointed with the content, not the seller."
5,Ending life with dignity,"Death in Venice is my second favorite movie just because it is so perfectly done. The whole movie can be seen as a cohesive work without flaws. The image of youth and old age is astoundingly beautiful. The great cinematography is translucent yet perfect. Dirk Bogard played his part with the sensitivity which his role demanded. This whole movie has a power which overwhelms you and leaves you stunned at the end. The final image of the boy standing in the sunset is as if Michelangelo had cut him out of stone. A perfect, poetic movie made for those who appreciate the finest cinema has to offer. When I first saw this movie in 1971 I had my ex-wife with me. At the end of the movie she was absolutely awestruck and unable to move for a few minutes. I had to coax her out of her seat to come with me. This is a powerful movie."
5,A great cinematic jewel now on DVD,"In this age of putrid mediocrity this film sparkles like the timeless true bijou masterpiece it is. Yes it is slow but that is one of its chief virtues . Watch it and savour every superb frame, every delicate nuance,the astonishing painstaking art direction ,the exquisite lighting of a Venice that no longer exists and especially the flawless and tragically visceral performance by Dirk Bogarde, a master actor who was the equal of De Niro,Hoffman and Pacino put together in terms of subtlety and spareness. His conviction in the role permeates every frame and squeezes the heart long after the film has finished. Silvana Mangano need do nothing but allow the camera to caress her to make us gasp and the boy who plays Tadzio is the most arresting vision of androgynous beauty imaginable. Visconti the master created a true masterpiece with this film.A rare experience and a very beautiful one."
3,"Resubmitting review of ""Death in Venice""","I already submitted this review last week. What I recall stating was that this was a beautiful VHS copy, am glad to have it, but that neither Amazon nor the seller gave any information that this was dubbed rather than subtitled.So, as I stated before, this is a terrific product but more information would be much appreciated, especially with films where subtitles are preferred."
4,More Information Is Required,"I previously purchased 2 copies of the 2004 DVD Death in Venice. This prize-winning film is quite remarkable and has had somewhat of a cult follwing for 40 years. My only disappointment with the 2004 DVD was that the transfer could have been better. The video was OK but could have been sharper. The audio was somewhat fuzzy. The film would have been even more impressive had it been cleaned up as Critereon Edition does with its DVD releases.There now is an August, 2010, release of the film. The listing gives no indication that this new release is a better quality. Amazon responded to my inquiry requesting more details by stating that they are unable to provide such ""general information."" If the 2010 release is significantly better than the 2004, I would buy another copy. If it is not, there is no point."
3,Question on aspect ratio,The original film was shot in 2.35:1 aspect ratio but the DVD information I have seen just says widescreen. This implies the DVD is 1.75:1. Can anyone confirm the actual aspect ratio of the DVD?
2,not happy,i bought a dvd the sound is not good the dvd was about $3.50. im not happy as to return it i have to pay postage which is more than the dvd
4,The necessity of evil,"Clearly, this is not one of those movies that can be universally recommended: it's slow pace and subject matter clearly place this film in a category that's not easily accessible to all viewers. The trailer for this film is available at the Internet Movie Database, and if it doesn't completely turn you off, you probably will enjoy ""Death in Venice""The film is elegantly shot, and it's pacing is so elegaic, you can feel the protagonist slowly loisng his will to fight against his worst instincts. Bogarde's twitchy performance is hugely watchable, and, for such a slow movie with very little dialogue, the big ideas are tossed out in noisy blasts (of course, it helps to have one of the characters as an obnoxious provocateur).Unfortunately, the film suffers from some rather abrupt editing, and the sound mix is awful. The scenery is so important that watching on video is also going to reduce the experience."
3,Beware: English spoken,"This is Luchino Visconti at the peak of his power as a reggiseur. This film is like a beautiful simphony, with a superb cinematography. No doubt, a film for the eyes pleasure. Dirk Bogard plays the part of his career and Silvana Mangano is exquisit as Central Europe countess (Visconti's mother look a like). The adagietto, the discussion about art and beauty, the decadence of an entire way of living... this is certainly one of the most important works from an unique artist of the second half of the XX century. Sadly, it is an enormous mistake that this long waited DVD edition was not released in it's original Italian language. Cinema lovers should wait for the european release."
5,"Moving, heartwrenching and yet tormenting",There is nothing one can say regarding this masterpiece which would even begin to give this work the justice it deserves. The world must watch this.
4,"""Death in Venice"" - gorgeous, atmospheric and moving.","In today's cinematic world of smash cuts, CGI, endlessly crashing vehicles and dialogue consisting primarily of phrases like ""Let's get outta here!"" and much grunting and groaning, Lucchino Visconti's leisurely-paced, tone-poem will no doubt bore to death anyone whose taste runs toward Jerry Bruckheimer epics. Visconti and his actors take their time and let this sad tale unfold in a uniquely luxurious manner. By ""luxurious"" I mean long, deliberate panning shots of early 20th century European bourgoisie at their pampered leisure and extended takes of Dirk Bogarde's beautiful, haunted face as he processes his own demons while surrounded by elegant taste and decorum. The film is short on dialogue but long on eloquence, demonstrating the power of the camera in the hands of a master of visual imagery."
3,Not For Everyone,"The real star of this highly touted film is the haunting music of Gustav Mahler. It reflects the emotional turmoil of the main character (Dirk Bogarde), a musician whose life has reached a standstill. Visually, the film is very beautiful to watch, but the tempo is lethargic, and the dialogue only occasionally connects the viewer to the characters. I found it difficult to care about what happens to these people, and I wanted to care. Was it the restrictions of the Victorian times in which it all took place? Dirk Bogarde's musician suggests early on that ""life is not worth thinking about"" --yet, he seems clouded with nothing but thought throughout the film. His fascination with the Garbo-esque youth is understandable, but the scenario takes us on endless journey that ultimately goes only ... sideways."
4,Fair and balanced presentation,"Certainly not the easiest read in the Amazon collection, but assuredly a different portrayal of George Washington than you'll find in the more common ""I cannot tell a lie"" variety. I'm no scholar in histrionically figures, but this book had the ring of a fair and balanced presentation. Oh, and a Kindle freebie!"
4,George Washington - Nice read,"I enjoyed reading and seeing a side to an important founding father that I had not really known much about in the past. Yes, in school way back when, I would have found this more interesting and helpful than the trash we were given to read in our history books. I would say, read it. It gives you a lot, let's you ask questions about history in a good way. It does show the harshness of war and the sentiment of the times in a shortened form. It gave me an interest in learning more about him and others from our beginnings. Granted free always helps, but the information learned was excellent and insightful."
4,mel folsom ca,Good reminder of the amazing events that gave birth to this country. The taxation of the colonies that inspired the Revolution is history repeated in Obama era politics.This book draws some interesting parallels between WWI and Washingtons advocacy of neutrality in the conflict between Great Britain and France.
5,A Complete Life's HIstory of George Washington,"This book is an awesomely epic text in description of the man George Washington. Written in 1908, it is superior to modern writings tainted with the falsity of equal rights. Men are men is this text, and women do NOT compare, NOR are even considered to being, NOR having anything to do with the actual building of America. In 1908, women were MUCH more in their natural subservient God-given places. Therefore, U.S.A.'s women didn't have a chance to cloud the mind of the writer with equal rights polution. For this reason, this text is more accurate in reality."
2,George Washington,Poorly organized. Sometimes there is no distinction as to the writer's words and those of quotes of Washington's from another source. Disrupts the flow of the story or scenario of events.
3,G. Washington bio.,"Interesting if you're really into learning more about George Washington. It is, however, a difficult and slow read due to the language used in quotes by Washington and others of the 18th century but also by the author himself."
3,good introduction to the subject,"The book shows many views of technology acquisiton, but I think it could be more detailed in hints and tips for the real life."
3,clip-on desk lamp review,"Lamp quality is excellent, but lamp may not be the most stylish. good, but not great deal"
2,Please don't cut corners on these!,"What happened to the better quality of these kinds of clip-on 60watt lamps just 6 months ago? The cord on this lamp is way too short. As are all of them now at all the office supply stores as well. Also, if you handle the outside of the shade, you'll burn your fingers. It gets way too hot to the touch. One should be able to position where you want the light to shine (hence the bendable neck), however, after it's only been on 20 minutes, it'll burn the hand that tries to move it! It's very hot even with just a 60watt bulb that it uses, and by which it emits super great light for its size. I ordered these because I had gotten 8 of these type of clip-on lamps from Office Depot a year or so ago (a bit bigger) so they would throw out more light than the minis. I've loved them every day. They were $12. Could someone please bring us back that $12 60watt clip-on light? I'd pay $2 more so I don't burn myself and have a longer cord."
5,"Great light, low cost, sturdy construction.","It's a strong versatile lamp. I have it clamped to an old pole lamp which is quite thick, but the jaws opened up wide enough to hold on, and it's been there for about a week now without falling. As I had hoped, it applies just the right amount of light with the florescent bulb I put in it, and replaces the old energy hungry quartz lamp it is attached too.I recommend this unit to anybody who needs a simple source of light that can be mounted nearly everywhere."
3,Good lamp for the price,Bought this lamp to clip onto a shelf over my desk. It is compact and the clamp is strong enough to hold it in place. Nice design and the cord is long enough to reach the plug several feet away. The only complaint is that the switch is very flimsy and the light can flicker on by moving it around slightly. It is a simple design though so it can be replaced with parts from the local hardware if needed. I'd buy another one.
1,Anti-abortion rights propoganda,I had no idea that this film was anti-abortion rights. I think it must have been funded by anti-abortion groups from the US who are busy trying to overturn Roe v. Wade and bring back back-room abortions thereby killing more women and babies in the process. The only thing scary was the message.
2,Easily Forgotten,"Well the other reviewers covered everything but 1 point,...the box is marked Anamorphic Widescreen,....it isn't. It is the only Tartan Asia Extreme that is '4/3 letterboxed' that I have run across. I own many. Most are excellent. This one isn't,.. AND won't work on you widescreen TV. They have the subtitles in the black above and below the picture so you can't zoom the picture to fill the screen. You will have to watch a little picture centered on your big widescreen TV. I called Tartan to report the error and the customer service guy said,.."" Well,..what do you want me to do about it. I just work here and everyone else is at lunch."""
4,Great blind Pick!!,This was a surprisingly great movie! I didn't know what to expect and I am glad that I bought it!!
4,New territory for Melissa,"This is not the old Melissa Ferrick...but change is not a bad thing. After all, who wants the same thing for dinner every night? Her talent as a guitarist and singer still shines through on every song. The songs are richer in musical depth than past efforts, with the same insightful lyrics Melissa always delivers."
5,Her best album yet!,I have all of Melissa's albums and this one truly is her greatest accomplishment to date. It's my favorite!
3,frightening account of the inner workings of Government,"The Cult of the Atom is a frightening look at the inner workings of the Atomic Energy Commission, and it's successor, the Department of Energy. Very well researched, the author takes us on a journey of special interests, accidents, incidents, and the growing pains of a multi-zillion dollar industry. If evver you wondered about which side of the nuclear reactor debate to be on, this book will absolutely convince you. And if you wondered if Big Bu$ine$$ holds sway over government, this book provides ample insight. An economical addition to your favorite nukeheads' shelf!"
2,Just okay,"This play is just okay. It has a lot of problems, including some speechmaking, and the most obvious flaw: the play is about rethinking the death penalty. Opponents will tell you that the death penalty is unfair because it is disproportionatly leveled against minorities, but both main characters are white men. Overall, the dialogue is stiff, the characters are predictable and the ending is melodramatic. Still, it is a decent short read."
4,"Perry is above any criticism, however...","Perry's singing is fawles, and his great personality is out of question, as it appears in this DVD too. However, the quality is poor and repetitive of a few numbers. He's also often cticized for not having the talent to become a movie star, which I find annoying as he was not interested in it in the first place but rather focused on TV. I'd recommend ""Perry Como Singing at His Best"", which is not biased and at a higher level."
2,Not so hot,"Remembering Perry Como's songs and even his TV show decades ago, the DVD was a letdown. Maybe it's just the passing of time."
5,Gorgeous,This is an impressive and beautiful book about the love between a mother and a son. It is exquistly written and a real page turner.
5,Awesome,"I have nothing bad to say about this book. As a fellow writer I am so impressed and amazed by Austin's talent and depth. I would love to read more from this talented, gorgeous guy. I hope he keeps writing....as for any lack of editing? Who cares? Tne most important thing in any writing piece is content, and this book was incredible...touching and thought provoking. Mr. carty, if you're reading this, I think you're wonderful!"
5,awesome,I agree. Austin's book is outstanding. It's insightful and deep. I can't wait for the next one.
2,Good thing he's pretty,"As an avid reader, I was horribly disappointed with this book. As I read others reviews I almost gagged on the words. I found this story totally fictional and very undeveloped. I think had he spent more time in the writing and editing process perhaps something more memorable could have emerged. Overall, I was very disappointed... Don't waste your money."
1,Horrible book.A true stinker!,"This book truly has nothing to offer.The literary merit is poor,the characters thin and the plot predictable. The book is only good for one thing,an expensive coaster or a good way to start a fire. I think the author may in turn suffer from an Oedipus complex.Stay far away from this book."
3,man of house,"movie i grew up with, so it brings back memories. the sound track is jamable. only problem is that the movie skips."
5,Man of the House,"It arrived in a timely manner as all orders purchased from Amazon.com. One DVD from a previous order (Wedding Date)was replaced without any problem when it arrived damaged. Usually, I hesitate to order online but Amazon.com is one of a limited number of companies that I have learned to trust."
3,funny,this video was funny and i liked it a lot. it was emotional because his father left him but he got another one.
1,"Charming, likeable family film...dreadful DVD","Even though it's been lambasted by some critics, I think ""Man of the House"" is one of the finest live-action films Disney has released in the past decade. It's sure to bring a smile to your face, with its memorable characters and genuinely funny moments. Chevy Chase and George Wendt standout in hilarity, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas does great in the lead role.But, alas, Disney must not want us to buy the films we like on DVD. That must be why they keep releasing them in modified form, rather than the WIDESCREEN aspect ratio that they were created for and exhibited in. So, it's a shame I've been waiting six years for this movie to come to DVD, because it's a garbage Pan & Scan job, just like ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids."" When will the Mouse House learn?"
1,Please avoid at all costs,"Chevy Chase is dreadful in the lead as Farrah Fawcett's fiance and Jonathan Taylor Thomas is annoyning as the bratty kid that's just annoyning and a loser child actor(what movies has he starred since this one). The childish plot revolves around a single mom and her brat son who hates her new fiance and then he looks for ways to have fun with the bratty son and then the movie fails to entertain and the movie is basically a Disney movie with no point,plot,or substance that you will enjoy your time doing something better like mow the lawn,build a puzzle,or trying to match the cubes on a Rubik Cube. Even Max Keeble was more funny than this unfunny,unwatchable mess. [...]"
5,Predictable but entertianing,"I think it is Jonathan Taylor Thomas best movie. Together with Zachary Browne he does a great picture. This movie is so ""Americkan"" it can be. No problem to predict the end after 10 minutes of the film but it is still much entertaining. New happenings all the time.I loved it"
5,Great Chevy Chase Comedy!,"Man of the House is a very funny family movie. Ben's mom is a single mother and is looking for a father for Ben. Ben's mom meets Jack and Ben hates him. A boy at school gives Ben an invitation to a group called ""Indian Guys"". Ben gets Jack to join (Ben's plan). Ben plays jokes on Jack to get him embarassed. Meanwhile men are trying to kill Jack. Jack and Ben go on an ""Indian Guys"" campout and the men that are trying to kill Jack catch him, but the other ""Indian Guys"" save Jack and Ben, and they become Best Friends."
3,Featuring J.T.T.,"A DVD worthy of being added to your collection, especially if you are a Jonathan Taylor Thomas fan. Not quite as cute as in his early 'Home Improvement' days, but he's still a gem nonetheless. Mildly amusing and entertaining movie otherwise."
2,Man of the House and Travelin Tyke,"I dont really like this movie. Kinda like a Home Improvement TV show for 2 hours. Boring and predictable, even for samll children."
5,Outstanding!,I have had this CD since it was released. I have since searched on Robert Michaels looking for follow-ups. This is a moving collection of an awsome flaminco style that just moves me more and more each time I listen to it. Very highly recommended if you like the Spanish/Cuban flavor in guitar that will just keep you wanting more! GIVE US MORE ROBERT MICHAELS!!!
1,TERRIBLE QUALITY ! O RATING ! ZERO! ZILCH!,THIS MOVIE WAS SO POOR IN QUALITY I'M AMAZED THAT ANYONE WOULD DARE TO SELL IT! THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED AND I WAS DUMB ENOUGH TO PAY $9.98 FOR IT! IT IS NOT EVEN WORTH $1.00. IT SHOULD BE TRASHED! WHAT A SHAM IT WAS.
3,Solid intro to Paul McCartney,"This video gives you a solid idea of Paul's career from 1970 until 1986. The video is taken from a special done in 1986 to promote the then current album, Press To Play. It includes clips from various music videos and projects. Paul discusses each album of his career. He doesn't spend any great length on lp's from around 1978 onwards. He does go into some more detail about Band on the Run and his then current lp.It would be good if Paul released a clip of videos from 1970 to the present onto DVD. Wingspan is also a better choice for a DVD to buy first. Again, this is not bad for a starting point. Perhaps MPL will be smart enough to release this onto DVD, perhaps with some music videos from each period in Paul's career (even during the time of this video, 1970-1986)."
3,Good melodic hard rock,"If you're looking for melodic good hard rock that's leaning toward the (light) heavy metal side, this album is for you. This is comparable to bands like Dokken, Tyketto and Europe. The material is well written and the songs are all melodic and catchy. The singer Jeff Scott Soto have also done some vocals for Yngwie Malmsteen, and bass player Marcel Jacobs played on John Norum's first solo album."
2,Not even average,This concert is quite disappointing. I wish I knew how bad this concert was so I wouldn't have wasted my money...
1,what a shame!!,i do not get it!! Stupidity to extreme on this blu ray for corporate you know what!!!! Cuttinf beautiful son from this great set!! What a shame....buy the dvd!!!
2,"Good for Beginners, Intermediates may want more.","I was a bit disappointed with the title of this video -- and it can appear very misleading. As an aerobics addict and yoga novice, I was looking for something that would challenge me physically, and this was not it.In all fairness, this is an excellent tape for someone just beginning yoga, but intermediates may find it too easy. The instructions are very detailed and Alan Finger introduces every pose with excellent cues.It just wasn't for me personally -- I think I'll stick to the Power Yoga."
3,"Good in a pinch, but not a substitute for the real thing","this is ok if you don't have much time and can't make it to group practise in a real yoga studio. the good thing is that they go through a very thorough set of postures and alan finger does an excellent job of communicating how the proper expression of that posture should feel, even though he's not there to critique you. the bad thing is that they only do each posture once so you don't get a real good stretch or strengthening in any one position or muscle group. the girls demonstrating seem a little uncomfortable and camera shy at times but finger remains calm, cool and relaxed and in complete command of the subject. will help if you use a real yoga mat. i tried with a traditional exercise mat and slid around a few times reducing the effectiveness of the posture."
4,A good workout,I haven't done yoga for many years - and found this tape and the beginner video very good. Very good explanations with beginner and advanced postures are shown.
4,Art Pepper in twilight glory,"This is Art Pepper at his best, playing his heart out through his horn. There is noise evident on the recording, but it's obliterated by the intensity of the music once Art starts to blow. The playing time is only about 37 minutes, but this release is value-priced to compensate. There are better quality recordings from this period of his life, like the Village Vanguard and Tokyo sets, but this is a worthwhile and affordable supplement to those testimonies."
3,Surflon Predator wire,"This product was purchased for fishing for predators ""on the fly"". It's okish but will kink and there are better products for my needs on the market. I don't think that it's special."
1,Golden Browned off!,Nice picture of Hugh as a baby! Very cute but what a dirge! Only he knows what he's going on about. As a lifelong stranglers fan my only hope is he'll read this and offer to refund my hard earned wedge! Then do the same for every other poor sod that bought this non event!
5,Fantastic,"I bought many face masks for my migraines over the years, this is by far the best. It stays cold for about 20 minutes and cool for a while (just as they say). It is comfortable and pretty thick. I'm very glad I bought this.In case you have doubts this CAN go in the freezer and it does stay flexible and comfortable."
4,Good mask,"This mask is ultra cold when you take it out of the freezer, to the point where I put a hand towel between the mask and my face. It keeps it's chilly temperature better than many other gel masks I have had, and is pretty good comfort-wise. The heat is more warm than hot, and dissipates rather quickly(about 15 minutes or so), but this is about the same as all other gel masks I have used for heat. All in all this is a great mask, especially for the price. If I decided to buy another mask, so I can always keep one in the freezer, I would probably buy another one of these. Not perfect, but pretty darn close."
5,Nice product!,I just had eye surgery and it's very comfortable and soothing. I will use it in the years to come as well...
2,not crazy about it,it does not stay cold very long or warm. i would not recommend this. it is also very cold to the outside of the so i just put it on my forehead. a damp towel and a ziplock bag of ice is a better and cheaper solution
3,OK for what it cost.,It fit a bit too snug and I just can't get it adjusted properly. Over all though I think it was worth it.
4,Light and cool,"Light weight and used for post sinus surgery. It is true it cools after 15 to 20 minutes, so get two if you are having surgery or severe sinusitis. I have herb packs, and have used frozen peas, but this is quite nice as it is soft and light weight."
2,The product description is incorrect and misleading.,"This thing works reasonably well as a hot (dry) mask. However, the product description at Amazon says that it can be heated in the microwave oven ""or even hot water,"" so my intention was to use it dampened. The directions that came with the device say ""do not get the product's wet."" The two directions seem to be mutually exclusive. It is not worth my time to send it back, but if you want to use it for moist heat--forget about it."
4,Head saver.,"My husband loves this mask. He always used to have the rice bags that heated in the microwave, which is great, except you cant lay on your side and not have them fall off. I was so happy to find this mask. He uses heat for head/eye strain, while I use it cold. I love that we can both use this mask. It fits great on him and the adjustable head strap sealed the deal. I didnt have to buy two different sizes for us both to enjoy its benefits. He also stated how well it works for him as a comfortable eye mask just to keep out light. My only complaint is that I think my face is just a little too small for the contour of the mask. Some days I just cant find that sweet spot. Otherwise, this is a great mask and we love it."
3,fast shipping and good enough shipping,pro-fast shipping and pleasant through amazoncons- seams on outer material started coming apart after 2 weeks. I could send it in a get a new one or sew it but seems to much of a hassle for a cheap item ill probably just go with a different brand next time besides the seams it worked well.
3,Good For eye pain.... avaerae for headache,I am using this Item more than one yr ... I have sinus Problem .... Yah it helps me to reduce my Eye pain.. but it not that effective for headache and sinus ...I used it by heating it in a microwave have to wait for some sec to use.. otherwise it will be little hot to use.....The warm/hot effect doesn't exist longer .. i expected little more ... But i am Ok With this Product Not Happy though :)
4,Great for headache relief,I have found this to be very helpful both when kept in the freezer and when warmed in the microwave for sinus headaches.
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: Stays warm longer than others I've tried, feels comfortable on your face. It's well constructed, like that it has a removable, washable cover.Cons: It's stiff so it sits on the boney structure surrounding the eye balls which may be OK as a sinus mask, but doesn't work for me as I'm using it for dry eye syndrome. The elastic band around the head is rather stiff . . . could be made of a softer material to make it more comfortable. The elastic head band is attached to the washable cover, which means it'll get worn out faster that if the cover could be removed from the mask."
4,Wish it stayed colder longer,This is a great eye mask but only stays cold for about 20 minutes. Do as the other reviewers said and purchase 2!
5,Awesome mask,"wow,this eye mask is really wonderful ya,,This makes the eye to be so relaxed and relieves from pain and stress..nope its rate is not balanced with its use...Because it works more than its worth...from my point of view it is highly recommended guys...thank youSinus Eye Mask by Elasto Gel"
5,Terrific Purchase,"This mask is just what my husband and I were looking for. It has an adjustable strap which makes it very comfortable to wear and stays in place. You can fall asleep while you are using it but don't keep it on too long because your eyes will feel strange. Don't worry, though the strange feeling will go away in an hour or so. When you warm it up the heat will stay for approximately 15-20 minutes which is about how long you should keep it on at a time. I would definitely buy another one of these. Also, the shipping was even quicker than expected which was very nice. This is a must buy if you have sinus issues or a cold. It will make you feel better."
1,A waste of money!,This mask is worthless if you plan on using it as a cooling mask. You can put it in the freezer for weeks and it will only stay just barely above room temperature for about ten minutes. Save your money. Buy a bag of frozen peas and put that on your eyes. Frozen peas are dirt cheap and they actually work at cooling hot fatigued eyes.
2,Worked great---til it didn't,"I prefer to deal with allergy problems without using drugs.Heat works best, for me.I bought 3 heat-delivering products at the same time.This worked great the first 3 or 4 times.Then, the 4th or 5th time I tried it, part of the edge came unsewed.I think it'll work again if I hand-sew it shut, butI'm afraid to use it til then.How long do we think it'll be til I get around to that? This decade or next?"
1,Fell apart after first use.,my daughter complained that it did not stay cold very long. On the fist use the seams began to unravel. By the third use the gel pack was coming out. We returned it and bought a different one.
4,Inexpensive Great Way for taking pictures of the moon!,"Best value for taking pictures like those of a full the moon!Litle bit heavy, so use a good tripod, but I have had great results!I've tried to included a picture taken with this lens but had no luck.On my experience the box in which it was packaged, was not as good as it should have been so once you recive it, make sure to find the T-mount inside."
4,Good price for the product,I was pleased with the capabilities of this lense for the cost versus the costs of a comprable zooming lense from other makers. It was a good buy for the money and even though it takes a little finess to make it work the way I want it was better than paying thousands of dollars.
5,A fine Kenya,"Before roasting I inspected these beans for quality. They were definitely premium grade, with very very few imperfections. I did a light roast slightly after the second crack and they roasted very even. Ground, these beans have a very rich aroma with velvety smoothness. Brewing the beans produced a very light, delicate brew with subtle aromas. A very good bean and an excellent company to purchase from, all around."
3,review,"What is up with the bad computer renderings? I think since it's drawing book-drawings would've been more appropriate. This book is somewhat confusing and reads like classroom notes....I'm still trying to figure it out and I have a BFA. Had I not already known most of these techniques described, I don't think I would be able to decipher this book at all. Its like figuring out a puzzle trying to figure out what is written and the computer renderings are of no help at all. Im not saying its a bad book, its just a really confusing read."
5,Just like the real thing.,"I attended one of the concerts for the recording (the Mucky Duck - site of the CD outtakes). I also attended his Sept. 9 CD release party/concert at the Firehouse in Houston. The CD truly captures the live concert feeling (complete with everyone singing along). If you've seen him live, this CD will not disppoint you. If you've not seen him live, you will appreciate just how much energy he puts into his concerts. Truly, ""Things look good around here."""
1,Not impressed.,If the author of this book was such an expert on Pine Bush you would think that he would at least get the township ( Crawford not Newburg) and the County ( Orange not Crawford) right. I have lived in Pine Bush my whole life and would contribute the sightings to have more to do with Stewart Airbase being a 15 min. drive away and the booming bar business that was going on during the 80's & 90's than any alien activity. The poor research on the town alone would lead me to doubt anything the author had to say.
2,A disappointed fan,"I have read all the 'in death' books and often count the days until the next one comes out but I was very disappointed in 'Purity in Death'. The playful 'here they go again' tone to the rampant sexuality of the books was completely overshadowed by the unnecessary introduction of practices that shouldn't be hinted at, much less described in detail and the vivid descriptions of crime scenes (which usually drive home the grisly nature of police work) were painted with such minute and gory detail as to be completely distracting from the story line and, frankly, nauseating! Reality may have it's place (even in fiction) but if I wanted to be scared and sickened by what I read, I'd read the daily newspaper.Because overall the series is so entertaining, I will no doubt read the next offering but if you're picking up J.D. Robb for the first time, I don't recommend you start with this one.In fact ... unless you're an addict don't read this one at all."
5,LOVED IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"PURITY IN DEATH WAS FANTASTIC!!! What else can I say? I couldn't wait to finish the book. Not knowing who or what is killing people (criminal and civilian) is what made this particular J.D.Robb unstoppable.In Purity, Eve and her team are up against an unknown assailant who attacks his/her victims through an unknown computer virus. Gripping till the very last page, with alot of surprises thrown in."
4,Robb is #1 in Death,"I picked up this book after hearing women on my Janet Evanovich e-list raving about how good this series was. I was leery. I've read Nora Roberts. I don't like her! I was supposed to read something else by her and enjoy it? Oh I don't think so.I was pleasantly surprised! I found this book to be refreshing in its creativity and characterization. Eve Dallas is a woman to envy. She's witty, intelligent, and she's got a drop dead gorgeous husband.She is won't let anything keep her from finding out what is going on with murderous victims' displaying ""ABSOLUTE PURITY ACHIEVED"" on their computer screens. The scum of New York City are dying, but so are the innocents, the by-standers, and cops. Eve has a team of experts working on the computers but can she stay ahead of an organization that may have powerful supporters in all parts of the city?"
2,Ho Hum,I have enjoyed the Eve Dallas series very much but I have the sense that either JD Robb has run out of new ideas or is just tired of the series. The phrases in this book are repeitions of dialogs from past books in this series. It gave me the impression that she had phrases mapped to keys on her keyboard and she just pressed keys to insert dialog. I'll have to think before I spend money on any more of these titles and I'm sad that these aren't enjoyable any longer.
5,"The latest in the ""In Death"" Series by JD Robb is a killer!!","This series is an intense, futuristic mystery that captivates from the first pages.... JD Robb has Eve Dallas searching through the twisted minds of killers that use computers to torture and kill their victims. She relies on Roarke, her bad boy turned good hubby who exudes condidence and power as easily as most people breathe.Just the right amount of techno mumbo jumbo to be realistic, combined with the perfect touches of humor, sex, romance, politics and fun to make the perfect read!If you have not tried this series yet... please do! Each book is a part o the development of the characters... and each book can also stand on its own. (First book in series is Naked in Death."
1,Very Bad,This is a truly bad book without a single original moment in it. Don't waste your time and money.
5,Simply awesome,"The header says it all. I love this series, and wasn't disappointed with this one and look forward to reading the next one"
3,Not her best one,"I usually love her books in the ""In Death"" series. This one just didn't grab me. It didn't have an interesting plot and it was not very successful. The development of McNab and Peabody's characters were interseting, though. Otherwise too many peripheral characters were thrown into this book."
5,"Everyone should spend some time ""In Death""","When I saw that ""Purtiy in Death"" was out, I wasn't sure if I was going to buy it, due the fact I haven't really enjoyed Ms. Robb's last few books. Well, I got and I so HAPPY that I did. Purity in Death is great! Lt. Eve Dallas and Roarke are back and they are in top form and on the hunt of a group who want Absolute Purity. In true Robb fashion, secondary characters such as Peabody,McNab,Feeney,Trueheart,and Baxter all are present and help to enrich the storyline.If the you have the time, spend some of it ""In Death"""
2,disappointed,"It was a really good mystery, but missing was the humour and interplay between Eve and Summerset, great ... with her husband, Peabody and McNab. Have been re-reading her first novels and they were just more enjoyable."
2,"""Or Resident?""","The book I ordered arrived in a timely manner, which I was impressed by, considering the bulk of things being delivered around this time of year. However, both this (and another package I received) had on the shipping address ""To Megan OR RESIDENT"". I was definitely taken aback at the fact that, although I was the one who paid for this merchandise, had it been shipped to the wrong address, whoever received it could have kept it. I was VERY unhappy."
4,Logging Too Much Computer Time May Have It's Hazards...,"In the newest ""In Death"" book, a new computer virus spreads through out the city of New York, causing more then fried circuits. It's been programmed to murder and Lt. Eve Dallas is on the case.Like another reviewer of this book, I've loved the ""In Death"" series every since I accidently stumbled upon it, yet I found this book lacking.The book got off to a great start, although it did include several mis-prints, one that should have been easily caught during editing.Halfway into the book sluggish, and ended quickly. Instead of focusing on the investigation at hand, the plot seemed to keep focusing on ""secondary character"" development. So much so I was beginging to wonder if Ms.Roberts is planning a Peabody/McNab spin-off (which wouldn't be bad).Even though I don't like this as much as the other books in the series, it was still enjoyable and I look forward to the next In Death book in March."
5,Deadly E-Mail,"Purity in Death by J.D. Robb is #15 in her In Death... series. In this book the 'E' cops are front and center in a story of a very different kind of computer virus. It's a story about a self-righteous group of people who attempt to 'purify' NYC by vigilante justice. Lt. Eve Dallas (joined by her tech-savvy husband and the 'E-team' is up against this group and the city political system.This was a good mystery story. The plot, the characters, the villians, and the technology are all well thought-out and well written. I recommend this book for mystery-lovers over the age of 15 years old because of some graphic sex and violence."
3,Fantastic fiction,I was at a trip to the Bahamas when I was reading this book. I was so into the book that I complete forgot about my surroundings and was more focused on the book rather than the vacation!!!
4,Future cop,"This is the first time that I've read a futuristic crime novel and, although I probably won't make a habit of it, I found it to be be very pacy and well written. Detective Eve Dallas, a gutsy, attractive 30 year old, married to a gorgeous hunk of a billionaire, becomes very involved in a sinister scheme to zap the brains of child porn monsters via their computers.The story is set some 60 years into the future and is full of techno talk like voice driven computers which can do almost anything. After an initial reluctance, I was soon drawn in and read it in 2 sittings."
1,it stinks,"No.1,they sent the wrong size for my phoneNo2.i contacted them by email 4 times to resolve the problemNo.3 they finnaly said to send it back )at my cost) and they would either send the right size or refund my money.i returned it in there original shipping package with the invoice and all pertinent information. so far i have been waiting 4 weeks and still nothing. so the hell with the whole thingrobert fletcher"
1,Also does not work with a cellphone which it claims it does work for,I'm sure it works perfect but it claimed to work for the 2600 so I bought one for my dad. The product arrived within days but the plug is the wrong size for the phone. Buyer Beware!! because it seems they claim this is compatible with many phones but it really is not
5,Great accessory,This is great to have for someone who likes the added security of a car charger. This one works great so far.
2,Broken,"The little black tip on the end of the charger snapped off inside my 8260 leaving it unable to be charged with either the car charger or the wall charger. The ATT store couldn't extract the piece and told me this was common for this charger and phone after 1 1/2 yrs. More of a hassle than I'd expect. Sure, it worked fast but I'm bothered by what seems planned obsolescence by the manufacturers at Nokia. I don't like having to get a new phone or accessories every couple of years. Thumbs down on the durability."
3,"Name brand no problems, yea right!","I researched several different types that would work on my older Nokia phone and found this one that had pretty good reviews overall. It also costs a little more being actually made by Nokia for a Nokia phone. I'm thinking where could I go wrong. Not! The only reason I gave 3 stars and a somewhat bad review is because when plugging it in to any car cigarette lighter for recharging, I usually have to twist it or rotate it a little bit to get it to make contact and for it to start charging the phone. Why I don't know other than the contact area is not big enough on the charger plugin. I had an older nonbrand one which only cost me 4 or 5 dollars that worked perfect for about 4 years until the plastic housing broke. Unfortunately I could not find it anymore."
3,Cord is a bit too short.,"While this is really just a simple cell phone charger- I must say-the cord is just too short to be useful while using the phone. I own an SUV, the cigarette lighter is rather low to the floor - I suppose my complaint should be with the car manufacturer. The cord makes it uncomfortable because its just a bit too short, I can only use this cord while speaking on my right. However, this OEM cord is much better than others I had bought before it."
1,Mine won't work,"I have a 1995 Saturn SC2, and I can't use this car charger, I guess it is too long to fit into my cigarette lighter, I am unable to get it in all the way!"
5,Works for me!,I needed a car charger for my Nokia phone but did not want to pay [$$$] for one at the celluar stores. The cord is a little short but this is fine with me since it still reaches the passenger seat or the cup holder. It serves its purpose. It's nice not having a long cord in the way. Thanks!!
4,Don't skimp on charger,"I've had a Nokia 6185 phone for over 3 years. In that time I've owned 4 car chargers. I was sucked into the ... allure of the 10-12 dollar ones sold at the big mass merchant stores. These things are junk. Don't reliably charge the phone and are flimsy and break all the time. After getting one that wouldn't charge out of the box and returning it for one that would charge once in a while (and finally died after a couple months) I recieve a new Nokia one with my latest phone (Nokia 3285). What a difference. Works like a charm, is sturdy, and did I mention it's sturdy!!! Wish the cord was a bit longer but other than that it's great."
1,Not for model 6010,"Unfortunately, the description is mistaken. The connector on this charger is far too small for the model 6010. While it may work perfectly well on some of the other listed models, if you have a 6010, don't buy it."
4,Invigorating to listen to...,"I'll tell you, I downloaded ""Black Lung"" with a skeptical mind. When I listened to it I was amazed to hear something that actually sounded good. This CD may not have much on it, but it makes you hope for a full LP - really soon!"
5,good product,I wanted an adaptor that was one piece and not a cable. This fit the bill. No problems at all with it.
1,"DETESTABLE, LONG, AND DULL","Breathtaking? Exhilarating? What other lies are posted on this page about this horrible, horrible film?Over two hours of sheer torture. The characters are odious, one keeps rooting for either of them to die and thus end the film promptly. (alas, my brother insisted on sitting through this thus making me a captive audience).The self-absorbtion, greed, sadistic tendencies, abusiveness, and general cruelty of both Verlaine and Rimbaud culminate in a tedious, vile, and overly lengthy waste of celluloid. Depressing, badly made, in places embarassingly acted, a meandering tale that leaves one hating humanity...skip it & be glad you did.Aside...love the 'stach on Leo when he's allegedly older. Must have been the Big Top Special at the makeup outlet."
2,"Promises so much, but delivers so little","Holland is a Polish director who directed a stream of medium-budget Hollywood arthouse films following the success of her breakthrough period piece, EUROPA EUROPA. Her fine directing is undermined by Leo DiCaprio's inept acting. Getting Leo to play Rimbaud is like asking Burt Reynolds to play Macbeth; this is just way out of Leo's league, and it's painful to watch him struggle with the dialogue. Apparently this was filmed before his breakthrough into superstardom; I read that once TITANIC came out, DiCaprio's agents tried to have copies of TOTAL ECLIPSE pulled off the shelf!"
1,Totally tedious,"DiCaprio and poetry don't mix. Although intending to portray one of the world's most intense homoerotic relationships (and with a few glimpses of frontal nudity), it all adds up to they-make-up-they-break-up-they-make-up-they break-up ad nauseum. With endless talk, and a good deal of virulent misogyny. You end up sympathizing only with Verlaine's long-suffering wife. For the two lead characters are completely insufferable. Quite a disappointment from the director who brought us ""Europa, Europa"" and ""The Secret Garden""."
4,Total Eclipse,A really good movie.....Leonardo plays his part well. The rest of the cast was also very good. It was a movie that could be a real life story and I am sure it has happened in the real world...!!!!!
5,Total Winner,This is the kind of movie that will make you think. To the conservative it will seem obscene and to the slow minded it will be to much to bear. Both DiCaprio and Thewlis became these two characters and seem to show the audience just how far genius and insanity can take you. The setting and dialogue is perfect and remains true to Rimbaud's poetry. It's quite interesting to understand the two poet's perceptions of love. If you appreciate art and have an open mind then this is the movie for you.
3,"Good movie, but not really about Rimbaud.","Although I think the movie is really enjoyable, and while I highly recommend it as such, it is not really about Rimbaud at all. Rimbaud's life mission (as explained in Enid Starkie's masterpiece) does not really rise to the surface: Rimbaud is shown as a rebellious youngster and as a boundary-breaking revolutionary poet. But... where is Rimbaud the disillusioned visionary? While Starkie's book explains the contradictions in Rimbaud's life and work, Hampton's film does not."
3,TOTAL ABYSS ?,"Having recently viewed this picture and having read some of the customer reviews, I think it wise to limit my remarks to personal reactions, past and present.With all of World History before them, just why are DiCaprio and Thewlis signing on to portray a duet like Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine in the first place? After doing some terrific work in ""The Basketball Diaries"" and ""Gilbert Grape"", why the need of a 20 year old budding star venturing into dangerous waters such as these? Why should Verlaine (Thewlis),only ten years older than Rimbaud(Leo), be cast as someone resembling a geriatric? Why no semblance of a French accent for Leo? Why no real mention of the collective works of these men--themes, theories,the non-sexual frustrations of any author? In short, the film is not a complete waste of time. Nor is it as topical ,meaningful, or well acted as it might have been."
1,bizarre and mystifying,"I've left the television to write this review, as I was worried that any more eye-rolling was going to damage my vision. Leo di Caprio as the French Symbolist poet, Rimbaud? Well, it's actually WORSE than I could have imagined! It's as if he's accidentally wandered from Los Angeles, 1995, into a Masterpiece Theatre production, complete with typically excellent British actors. It even sounds as if he's ad libbing lines, they're so utterly anachronistic. I guess I could try to see this as a time-travel story-- then his fist-in-the-air ""woo!"" wouldn't seem like an asonishing directorial lapse as much as an illustration of behavioral differences between fin de siecle France and contemporary American teen culture.I'd love to see what Mystery Science Theater could do with this goofy waste of film and decent British actors. I second the previous reviewer who suggested just getting a couple of books of poetry instead of this film."
2,Leo Stinks,"This movie was Fair. I dont understand why if Leo's character was supposed to be french then why didnt they have him speak in a accent. The rest of the characters did. I dont understand why people and critics praise Leo has being a great actor. Hes just fair. Not terffic. Im very upset that one of the movie magazines qouted ""was he robed of an Oscar"" for Titanic. Please he wasnt that brillant of an actor. Please dont watch this movies becuase of Leo. The movie could have found better actor for the part. Titanic should have found a better on too."
2,Not Good,"This film educated me about Rimbaud's life, which I was glad to learn about, but DiCaprio, who can act brilliantly, doesn't act well here. (He's playing a Frenchman, but speaks in an American accent: a mistake). For the prurient among you, the opportunity to see Leo's bare rear (and even his shadowed package) and to see him French kiss another man, might be reason enough to see it. But, really, this movie is rather a stinker."
2,Disappointing movie,"Having read so many reviews about ""TotalEclipse"", I rented the movie with great expectations. To put it mildly, I was disappointed. There was no quality at all, and even though DiCaprio tried his best, the movie just wouldn't lift. I suggest that you read some of Rimbaud's poetry instead of watching this poorly-made film."
1,Not a wise move for Dicaprio,"I just saw this film two days ago because I think Dicaprio is a great actor. This film is really not entertaining AT ALL. The two actors do not have chemistry to fulfill the story. They break up constantly and ""use"" each other. At the end we don't even see why they come apart, and the potrayal of Leo as a older man w/ a fake mustache silly. Personally I don't recommend it."
1,Warning: Don't watch without a barf bag,"A team of movie producers must have come together and said to each other, ""Instead of making a movie that is actually entertaining, why don't we see how many ways can we find to disgust, bore, and depress the viewers?"""
3,Eh.,"This movie wasn't great, wasn't bad, it was barely good.Knowing a little about the poet Arthur Rimbaud I wanted an insight into his life. The way he was portrayed was less than wonderful.Leonardo played him as a whiny, selfish immature little boy. Little of his genius was shown. I realize that Arthur was young but he also had a mind mature enough to create such wonderful work. To me this movie should have been about his work first, it wasn't, his gay lovelife was.While that is a big part of who he was I could have done with less of their relationship and more of the work of both he and Paul Verlaine.Paul Verlaine came across as a complete nut case. I honestly couldn't see what either found so attractive about the other. And since this was made to be more of a love story you'd think that they would have worked a little harder on the chemistry.This movie wasn't bad enough to turn off, but not good enough to buy or watch again.I was hoping for a little more depth."
3,Poets without poetry,"This film has surprisingly little to do with the real story of Verlaine and Rimbaud. (Check it out on Wikipedia if you like.) Rimbaud wrote to many poets before Verlaine ""bit"". The issue of homosexuality was probably more Verlaine than Rimbaud - Verlaine went on to have other male lovers; Rimbaud didn't. The narrative is also quite far off. Rimbaud lived to 37; the film implies he died much younger. Those are important points, but my main issue is with the fact that this is a story about two very important poets, and there is not one scrap of their poetry in the film. It isn't as if there isn't time; we get shots of trains travelling through the countryside for no good reason, but no poems. I don't mind DiCaprio's performance here, I thought it was competent and it shows what he is capable of at that age. I just don't think the film is worth watching."
4,"Good movie, but should of had another focus.","I thought this was a wonderful movie,about the romance between two poets, and the special bond between them.Rimbaud was a genius, and this movie depicts it, somewhat.The movie should of focused on the genius of this poet rather that his sexuality."
3,Well made but depressing film.,"I saw this at the theatre and although I am not a DiCaprio fan I thought this was one of his better roles. The film was well made, but I found the two lead characters distasteful which made it difficult to really say I enjoyed the movie. Great cinema but not everyones taste."
4,Naot gardenia sandals,"The footbed is very comfortable which is standard for Naot. I found the leather on these shoes to be quite stiff. The leather covering the toe area fits narrow. Because i always order a size up in Naot shoes, i can fit into these. I'm hope the leather gives abit after i wear them and streches over the toe area to avoid any digging in. Its too bad Naot does not have a wide fitting shoe, for all of us that have a wider foot."
1,if the last version was any indication.....,"I will admit to not reading the updated version. However, in the last version it read, ""a woman should not wear pants on the job...some men simply don't feel comfortable with a woman wearing pants; the woman may unconsciously be threatening to her male colleagues. To me, this is reason enough for female managers not to wear pants in the office.""Palleeeeeeze."
3,Good but outdated texts...,The premise of this book is solid; but it's somewhat out of date. It appears to be a cash cow as there isn't much in the way of competition for this type of text.
5,An absolute must for anyone in any job!,"This is an excellent book, useful for anyone performing any activity in which they interact with others. Useful for businessmen, diplomats, lawyers, doctors... the works. The office etiquete it presents is useful for all levels: from high management to entry level."
3,CLASSIC AND GREAT,"Great to see that three-cornered chemistry again; Dietrich, Wayne and Scott. Released in '42 and a bit of wartime propagnda for the Home Front but none the worse for that. Matter of fact, worth watching if only to see the way Union Labor was courted for the War Effort; that is, with open acknowledgement of the value of worker participation and promises of a fair share of the rewards for it.Pittsburgh is supposed to begin in the 20s, but forget it. The costumes don't reflect that at all (probably would have been too expensive) and the shots of traffic are strictly contemporary. Average age of cars, app '39. But what the hell, Dietrich never looked better, and neither did Wayne or Scott. Recap of their great success, THE SPOILERS of Jack London. Then, gold-mining. Here, coal-minig. No dansing, but great brawls.Talk about nostalgia! Two great-looking guys fighting over a beautiful woman. Works every time. Why does everythign have to be so damned Freudian?"
1,Two Thousand years later: A novel,"I found this book as I was researching the legend of Jesus and Mary Magdala's possible relationship. I bought it and was excited to read it. I kept on reading waiting for the part of the book that would make me feel justified for the money I spend on it. But it never came. To my opinion, the story is lacking big time. It is very repetitous. The main characters (totally unrealistic) tell and retell their dreams over and over and you wonder if there is a end to it and if they are ever going to get to the point. A ""wannabe"" philosophical version of the Love Boat. I had to force myself to read it and I could not wait to finish to move to something else worth my time. In my opinion it is not worth the paper that is written on."
1,Reviewing the reviewers,"I dont think that the other people that have posted reviews of this book are talking about the same book, because if they are then they are either friends or family of the author. There is no way that this book can be found interesting by anyone with a twinkle of intelligence that have read books other than Dr. Seuss books. If you are an independent reader please dont bother."
5,On time no problems,Great show! I use it to teach my kids how to use their skills to make things. Highly recommend this video.
3,To be seen,This is another gift to my Dad. He liked it. He has always liked old Fords. Well enough to own a '29 model A.
3,i aint hardcore i'll tell ya that,well it isn't fast but it aint bad if you dont mind that sort of thing but its good to see industrial strength try a slowr tempo dont get me wrong there are a couple of hardcore beATS on this disc and the arent bad this is some quality grooves but like i said it aint hardcore
1,"""Cassie's Done Stripping...""","Very misleading cover art, if you are expecting a grindhouse B-Movie sexploitation film... I was. The cover is made to look like a 60's drive-in poster, (must have got the idea from a recent release called ""Teenage Hitchhikers"" which DID deliver a classic sexploitation film. BUT if you pay attention to the text, ""Cassie's Done Stripping..."", well her stripper days were BEFORE they made this film, even in her sex scenes she remains fully clothed. And at the strip club,the strippers never appear in less than fully covered lingerie. Except for maybe 5 seconds, from a distance, and edited so tight you better not blink. Other than that, its a fair attempt at the consequences of finding drugs and money that are not yours. The only exploitation is in misleading the buyers."
2,Pass on these,I bought this 4 pack a few years ago and just used my last one. Amazingly they have all stayed incredibly moist over that time. UNFORTUNATELY they leave streaks all over my laptop display. I won't be buying them again and cannot recommend them.
5,Holocaust survival,"""PASSPORT to LIFE' by Dr. Emanuel Tanay brilliantly describes the heroic survival of an adolescent to save himself, his younger sister and his mother, through unbelievable circumstances, during the German occupation of Poland and Hungary in WWII.This autobiographical story describes a different type of holocaust survival, than those in the Nazi concentration camps.Mark Fintel (A holocaust survivor)"
5,Passport to Life,"This work is a vivid account of the eyewitness views of the Holocaust during World War II as recalled by a teenager who managed to survive. After the war he emigrated to America and became a prominent forensic psychiatrist. His insights into the evils of Naziism and the reasons for its success during the German occupation of Poland make for fascinating reading no less gripping than the best of Stephen King's tales of terror and horror. It is the story of ultimate cruelty and dehumanization of Jews in which the psychiatrist asks the haunting question: ""Why do people hate?"" His persistence over many years to tell his personal story is a triumph of the human spirit.George J. Halpern, M.D. and Abraham L. Halpern, M.D."
1,Horrible,"Most uncomfortable, digs in, falls down, does not hold them up, would not recommend them to anyone, useless and overpriced, would like my money back"
1,Waste of money!,These are horrible and a complete waste of money! As soon as I put them on they slid down. There is nothing to keep them up on their own. Don't buy these unless you plan on getting a garter with them (yuck!) I bought the ones with the silicone top and they work a bit better - still not great but better.
5,This Is a Good Little Car Charger,"I have purchased the car battery charger for my MicroTAC 650 phone, and I love it! It charges the battery so fast! Your battery can be completely dead, and as soon as you plug your phone into the car adapter with this charger, you can make and receive calls from your phone. It doesn't take long at all until you have a fully charged battery, ready to use anywhere. Incidentally, my MicroTAC 650 is an analog phone, but I would recommend it over any of the new digital phones. I switched to a digital phone last year because they were supposed to be better, but I switched back to an old reliable MicroTAC 650."
4,Veeeeery slow shipping,"I wrote my first comment almost 2 months ago:""I know the book is great, but I am still waiting for the shipping. It is taking forever"".Now, two months later, I am still waiting, and amazon says It may take even to the end of November (2 other months)!!!I just dont trust in amazon anymore to buy books. What I think is the price is higher now and they do not want to send it."
5,Inexpensive and durable,I had been going through o-rings on our tube filling machine like crazy. I had to replace it once a week or more often. I decided to order this 25 pack since it was so inexpensive. It's been a month and a half and I have not yet replaced the first one of these. They seem to be extremely durable so far.
5,It's round and rubbery,"Dunno what to say about an o-ring, but they appear to be well-made, come nicely packaged, etc."
4,The hardware store said I couldn't buy these,Just what I needed to fix my pool fill valve. 25 is a lot but now I'm covered.
2,Strings start hitting the fingerboard,"I own this guitar for 1 year and 3 months. Bought the package from Amazon. At the beginning, everything is fine, the guitar is good, and the amp also works well. After about 6 months, the third string start hitting the fingerboard when I play it on the first fret. That's fine to me, it is just some little extra noise.I usually practice scales on high frets. This morning, I wanted to play C major to see how it's nodes fit in the major scale, and I just found out that all 6 strings would hit the fingerboard on the first fret. It's not just a noise this time. If I play the strings, all I hear is the sound of a metal string hitting on another metal. I won't call it music.Also, I cannot find Baja's website or any information about them. I'll just keep it like that and stick with my scale practice in high fret.For those who consider this one, even for a beginner, I don't recommend it."
1,Worst birthday gift ever,"I got this guitar pack from my parents for my birthday. It was lame. I told them to get a Fender Standard Series Stratocaster and a matching Fender amp but they said that it was too expensive. They got what they paid for. $84 for a guitar alone usually signals junk, but for a complete package? Firewood.The guitar's neck dented easily, and the tremolo bar snapped. The amp started buzzing shortly afterwards. We returned it.Oddly enough, this site sells Gibson, Epiphone, BC Rich, and Schecter instruments, but no Fender or Squier instruments, only one Ibanez, and only the low-to-middle-end Jacksons."
5,Awesome sounds from awesome guyz,"Having heard these guys in person on more occasions than I can remember, it's great to be able to ""take them with me"" everywhere I go. The energy put into their music is honest and rockin'. If you ever get the chance to see them in person I highly recommend it, but if you're not fortunate enough grab this CD it's the next best thing to being there!"
1,Not what was advertized!,"Advertized as Copper but is is only Copper colored. I received mine and it has a dent in side of it and it has stains on bottom! Looks like it has been USED.The return policy says I have to pay for everthing so i will just not ever buy anything from this seller again! If there was something less than 1 star that,s what I would give this company."
1,Misleading description--NOT Copper,"""nonstick copper color silicone coating over carbon steel"" --from another websiteIt's made of carbon steel, not even stainless steel, and certainly not copper."
2,"If you need it you need it, but beware.","I am currently on my third of these car chargers. I have had to return the previous two, with some difficulty, as they continue to stop working. I have not been tough on them at all, they simply stop charging, the light won't go on, or they simply won't work. I realize that there aren't many options, as Samsung has been clever enough to design a very unique plug and it is unlikely that other manufacturers will emerge, but it is a shame that this product is not as durable as the phones that it supports."
4,Good standard car charger,"This is a good quality standard car charger. A small red light on the base lets you know if you're phone's actually charging or not, which comes in helpful sometimes if you don't push the adapter into the ciagrette lighter bay hard enough.I haven't had any problems with it in 9 months of use- I reccommend it!"
2,Demon Seed,"All other reviews are correct about the ""quality"" of the DVD. The story is very 70's. The only reason to buy, is to see Lana Wood nude."
2,"Overall, okay.","I had seen this film when it first came out, so I had low expectations on content. Unfortunately the quality of the image was low and contrasty. It was good to see Lana Wood again, though."
2,Good Film,"I ordered this particular one mainly because the 'product details' stated that it was 'close-captioned (for the hearing-impaired)'. This is definitely not the case. So, I returned it for a full-refund. In any case, the picture-quality is (almost) lousy. There are no 'scene-selections', either. Only if you are a (big) Lana Wood fan."
1,LANA WOOD ...AND THEN SOME .....,MUST HAVE COST 100 DOLLARZ 2 MAKE THIS MOVIE ....I SAW LANA WOOD IN A JAMES BOND MOVIE...THOUGHT I'D TAKE A CHANCE ON THIS MOVIE ...THE PRICE WUZ RIGHT ...TYPICAL CHEAP 1970'S FILM ....WHAT AN ACTRESS !!!!!
3,Erordic,the dvd film was not well lighted to see the filmyou could not make out what was happying on the dvd film at times.
2,For DUMMIES only.,"Although Maddog's book is good for the beginner who wishes to install Linux and at least get X running, it's not something that an experienced computer user would want to read.The writer often gets side tracked on to other subjects when discussing certain aspects of the O.S. In his attempt at humor, he often falls short with unlaughable examples of how bad the rest of the PC industry is.There are many points in the book where Jon writes, ""This is beyond the scope of this book,"" whenever he gets onto something that is good. Also, it seems to me that ""Red Hat Linux For Dummies"" is nothing more than a shameless plug at other For Dummies books. I noted well over twenty references to other IDG prints."
4,Red Hat Linux,"This is an excellent book. I just completed a Linux Administrator course and use this book as a supplement. The CD-Rom is the same as what the instructor had for the course. It would have gotten 5 stars, but it lacks some administrative commands and KDE workstation is not referenced."
2,Music is done differently for the worst.,"I am disappointed with this CD collection. The music is too fast a tempo, and the instruments are too loud and numerous. John Denver's voice is drowned out by the instruments. I dislike that many of the songs are a bit different from their original version. I would recommend this collection only to John Denver fanatics who have heard all his music before and want something different."
3,Lacks the sparkle,"Collection features some less known and harder to find tunes, and is great for this, but the recording is poor quality, songs are a bit ragged, not at all the perfection generally captured by John Denver."
2,Not the originals,"All your favorate songs, just not the version you remember. CD titles are old album titles but track listings seem to have little to do with what was on those original albums. If you are looking for classic JD this is not your best choice."
4,Excellent example for this genre,"Ms Shellenbarger has done a great job of organizing a lot of information into a book which is easy to read and communicates the experience of having been a soldier in Viet Nam. It covers the initial entry of both the battalion and its members into the war, their experiences while there and upon returning home, and their view of the war from the present. VERY revealing! There is no editorializing or conclusion-drawing by Ms Shellenbarger, which is just fine. The men's words stand alone. An admirable job with difficult subject matter!"
5,for my boss,My boss loves this book and likes to stock up on copies so she can give them as gifts. Its a great read and we will always look on Amazon for good prices and availability.
3,Agents in the French Resistance,"Agents in the French ResistanceJames Buckmaster's work ""They Fought Alone: The Story of British Agents in France"" is the second memoirs by the one-time chief of F-Section (French) of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). With this book the author makes no claim to accuracy. Overall the book is a compilation of case histories with details on resistance tradecraft. Check out his first book ""Specially Employed. The Story of British Aid to French Patriots of the Resistance"" which I think is slightly better."
4,A great time for the family,"My entire family love to play this game. An interesting twist on the original, this version adds in a government change and some rather interesting problems. It took us a while to figure out the cities, and the border crossing rule makes for more challenging track building (to avoid taxes). If you are a fan of Empire Builder, or any game in the series, this one is a must have."
1,The Banquet,"The art design and the film photography was beautiful, however, the rest of it just junk."
5,Kicker 03KQ9 EQ,Excellent unit - provided me with a way to biamp my factory system with after market speakers and subwoofer. Hookup and configuration were simple enough. Used RTA software with a calibrated mic and laptop computer to get my system dialed in using a pink noise CD. I am extremely happy with the final results. Thanks to Kicker for a reasonably priced unit with the features I needed to get my vehicle's sound system set up properly.
4,Another view of sailing ships,Excellent book about the life of Matthew Fontaine.Excellent livre montrant une histoire méconnue mais importante de la marine à voile.
1,Axcelerate bra,"I bought this bra for 2 reasons it has a racerback and it is medium intensity. It was only 1 of those. I bought the size according to the chart it was to tight. It was like wearing a breast binder, not comfortable at all. This is designed for high intensity a very small breast tissue. If you are that you'll love it, I'm not and I don't."
2,nice book,it's a good book but if you're an university student is just a source of information! no a complete book
4,More Turtles than you'll ever need,"My CD collection has grown to more than 2500 over the last 16 years. Back in 1984, the Rhino 20 Greatest Hits was one of the first CDs I ever bought. It still holds up as a great collection and is probably all the Turtles most will ever need. However, if 20 Turtles cuts is not enough for you, then is a good collection with detailed notes and good remastering (Rhino's 16 year old remastering seems to sound just as good). These 60 songs could easily fit on three discs and have been less cumbersome, but that is picking nits. Can't complain about the price. Sixty songs for 20 bucks, 33 cents per song. Also, there are quite a few unreleased cuts from their unreleased last album, and other curios.If it's just the great stuff you want to hear, though, the Rhino collection is still the best buy."
3,Great sound quality and liner notes...but lousy box set idea,"My guess being that Laserlight specializes in budget-line CD releases was what prompted them to create 5 individual short (12 song) titles by the Turtles and sell them each individually. The confusion is: why did Laserlight wait for unreleased material to show up first then release the box set at a discount long before releasing the titles individually, plus why on earth was Laserlight choosen in the first place as the company to release this Turtles ""Anthology""? Don't get me wrong...there's plenty of great stuff here at a great price. And the fact that a Turtle lover like me could finally get those unreleased gems was a definate plus. I just wish my box set was parred down to 2 or 3 jam-packed discs with the songs in chronological order instead of the chopped up, haphazard way Laserlight chose to do it."
5,Brain!??! What is Brain!!,"One of the most amazing and bizarre episodes of Star Trek.. the pure ridiculousness and absurdity pulls you in and makes you wonder ""how will they get spock's brain back from the beautiful space vixens!?!"". Pure genius! One of the best episodes of Star Trek ever!"
1,Golden Turkey,"Spock's Brain is what people would call a ""golden turkey"". This means that a movie/episode is so bad it's good. Spock's Brain is perhaps the best example of a ""golden turkey"". This episode will keep you laughing all 51 minutes. It is obvious that the cast members were embarrassed acting out certain scenes. Spock is visibly embarrassed walking around like Frankenstein and Kirk is practically laughing at the end when he asks Spock how he is doing."
3,"Worst Star Trek story line, but humorous","The script writing in this eposide is almost embarassing. But the unintentional humor makes up for it. Lines like ""Brain and Brain.. What is Brain"" and Scotty saying ""Spock's brain controls all this?"" are all good humor."
4,Almost perfect,"We bought this after several discussions about traveling on an airplane with our Chicco Liteway Stroller; we didn't need it through the airport, but would at our final destination. Orginally, I bought the red ""GATE CHECKED"" version, but read reviews that it hadn't stood up while en route. I read all the reviews for this bag and finally decided to just bite the bullet. It's true that the Chicco Liteway is just slightly too tall for the bag; it only means that the sides are not perfectly flat. The bag is huge compared to the stroller in width, giving us plenty of room to stuff toys and extra diapers around it. We noticed that only one end of the bag is padded, and weren't concerned at all. The bag and stroller arrived at our destination and again back at home without any damage or problems. This was a great investment for our treasured stroller!"
2,Not the best quality of parts...,Shoulder strap on my bag broke after using the bag on its 3rd round trip. The strap broke at the plastic adjustable slide after placing over shoulder. I have read other complaints about the strap attachment hooks breaking as well but mine has given out at a different stress point. It appears the quality of the plastic is a tad cheap. Also the zipper can be an issue as it hangs when the two sides of the zipper aren't perfectly aligned when trying to close. I fear that the zipper may give out at some point and we'll no longer be able to close it.
5,DOES fit Chicco Liteway,"I was a little hesitant to get this product due to reviews saying that the Chicco Liteway Stroller does not fit. I was pleased to find, upon opening the product, that it actually DOES fit (I will add customer pictures to the product to prove it). You have to work the top up and over the wheels, but it does fit. I am glad, I really didn't want to have to go with a more expensive product (or one that was just a nylon bag). It feels sturdy and well-made, and I am confident that it will serve it's purpose beautifully.EDITED 11/13/2012: Since buying the product, I have flown (with my son, by myself) twice. It has held up beautifully, and my stroller doesn't look like it ever went into the cargo compartment of a plane! LOVE this!"
4,Great-just needed it to be wider.,My daughter was flying to Virginia Beach Virginia to see her husband off to Kuwait where he is serving our country. She flew alone with two toddlers-one still in diapers. I had bought her a Jeep brand Double umbrella stroller. I purchased this for her to be able to send the stroller on the plane as a piece of luggage. The bag is nice and sturdy. It arrived just days after my online purchase. It is not wide enough for the Jeep stroller. My daughter already had the Jeep stroller at her house-I had to buy this with an estimated size. Seeing the stroller type that the bag could hold would have helped me.
5,Exelente,El producto superó mis expectativas. Muy buenos los materiales. Punta acolchada para evitar los golpes. Recomendable. Llegó a tiempo. Muchas gracias
5,good,used it overseas travel. it was sturdy and kept the stroller in good condition. the fabric is thick. not too difficult to carry either. i would purchase it again.
3,Ripped after gate check,"Looked sturdy but we gate checked our Chico Liteway and the bag was ripped when it came off the plane....Very disappointed as it was such a minor flight/check in for the bag to go through with the stroller in, literally we handed it to the attendant and grabbed it as we walked off the plane - the up side was it did protect the stroller but I will need to do some repairs to use it again."
2,Decent bag but cheap zipper,I bought this bag for my Uppababy G-luxe stroller. I stroller didn't fit unless I took off the fron wheels which isn't that big of a deal. As soon as I zipped the bag with the stroller inside the zipper split. Since we'll be traveling on a plane I didn't want to worry about a flimsy zipper so we'll be sending this item back.
2,Maclaren Techno XT does not fit!,"This bag does not accommodate the 2008 Maclaren Techno XT. I tried to force the top of the bag closed, but it just wasn't happening. Bummer, the bag seems to be well constructed and the padding is good."
2,Not suitable for Maclaren strollers?,"I have no idea how this bag is getting decent reviews unless people are using very, very lightweight strollers. We purchased this bag to accommodate our Maclaren Triumph (11.5lbs) and the hooks fastening on the longer carrying strap broke *on both sides* the first time we attempted to lift it off the ground. The plastic snapped in two. We are returning this immediately and purchasing a Maclaren bag."
4,A necessity!!,"I purchased this prior to a flight to keep my new stroller protected and clean. It works great, especially for the price.My only two gripes:-It had a tear in the heavy-duty fabric after the first leg of our trip (not the bags fault, I'm sure).-It is really hard to fold small when you are in a time-crunch. There really is no good place to keep it stored, so be prepared for that especially if you plan to gate-check your stroller (which we did).We purchased the First Years Ignite stroller for this bag and it just barely fit length-wise. Loved the padding on one end and the shoulder strap.Would definitely recommend!"
2,Chicco Liteway Does Not Fit,"My chicco liteway umbrella stroller does not fit in this without disassembling the front wheels. Another reviewer noted that they don't mind removing the wheels from their Liteway stroller to make it fit, but that is too much hassle for me in the airport with a small baby. I am going to return it.It seems like this is a good quality product if your stroller is small enough. Maybe a little bulky--just one more thing to deal with/store when it's not in use."
5,Great travel bag!,"We just received this bag today and it seems great so far. It fits our Combi Flare perfectly. The only thing I didn't like was that ONLY the top is padded. I know in the item description it says something about ""the padded end"" but it wasn't enough for me to catch that the whole thing isn't padded. I think it would be fine with most umbrella strollers but our Combi has a bit of a different style handle that needs a little cushion. We plan to toss a piece of bubble wrap in the bottom for our plane trip. Overall it's a great bag!"
1,Does not fit UPPABABY G-Luxe,Our stroller didn't fit but otherwise this bag looks good; beware that there is padding only on the top so nothing protects the other set of wheels
1,"Terrible expainations, terrible diagrams","I make a big mistake by buying this book. The illustrations, figures,and diagrams were to small and just plain bad! The authors did a bad job of explaining things, and of making the transition between chapters. It seemed as though one author did not know what the other one had covered, so there was needless, and endless repetition. The authors did not make the subject matter clear to me."
1,Horrible reproduction ruins the original book!,"This reproduction is an insult to the careful scholarship of Lorrin Andrews, a superb researcher of Hawaiian language. When I read this version, it seems that a lot of the Hawaiian didn't scan in properly and it is just nonsense. Apparently no one took the time to check the scanned in version against the original. You won't learn much from this book, there's too many ""typographical"" errors introduced by the reproduction. Don't waste your money. Go to the library and read the original. It is excellent."
5,Brillant!,"This CD is a big comeback by both legendary scores. All songs here are so melodic and so impactful. It blew me away. Its an album with heavy love ballads, whymsical lyrics and good production. Barbara and her partner did a great job!"
5,Don't Compare to Guilty,"The two albums are as different as night and day. Barbra really goes out on a limb with each song's diverse style. Barry's writing/producing/arranging and singing are superlative. This reminds me of the Bee Gees albums of the later seventies and early eighties where every song on the album was worthwhile. The standouts on this album are ""Above the Law"" ""Golden Dawn"", the broadway inspired ""Without Your Love"" the disco throwback ""Night of My Life"" and the Middle Eastern inspired ""All the Children"".Of note Streisand is 63 and Gibb is 59, yet this album sounds so refreshing and new. Barry Gibb describes this album as ""sensual- an album for lovers"", That is a very fitting statement. Run don't walk to your nearesr record/department store to purchase the dualdisc."
4,"Yeah, she's still got it.","The voice is still magnificent.Babs seems to be taking herself and her music a little less seriously, and that's a good thing. Thanks to producer Gibb, we get less lush orchestration (which has overpowered recent recordings) and more Barbra on a fine coillection of pop tunes. More listenable than anything she has done in years, this one is a pleasure indeed."
4,International Treasure,"This has got to be her best album since 'The Broadway Album'. 25 years after her 'Guilty' album, Barry Gibb again joins her for some super super tunes. Put 'The Broadway Album' in the middle and 'Guilty' on one side and 'Guilty Pleasures' on the other will make great bookends. 'Stranger In A Strange Land' highlights the album. No duds. Great singing with non-invasive backups by Barry."
4,Return to form,"Barbra Streisand's newest album is a guilty pleasure indeed. It's wonderful to hear her in fine form vocally. It's also nice to hear her embracing a more pop/adult contemporary sound. The magic is still there with Barbra and Barry Gibb. This is their reunion after 25 years, when the first GUILTY album was released. He appears on two duets ""Above The Law"" and ""Come Tomorrow"". He also lends background vocals to many of the songs. The production is crisp, and Barbra sounds great. Favorites include the ballad ""Golden Dawn"", the disco song ""Night of My Life"", and songs like ""Stranger In A Strange Land"", ""It's Up To You"", and many others. A notable song is the closing ""Letting Go"" which is the most poignant song on here. Overall a guilty pleasure indeed!"
2,Not a duet album,I was highly disappointed that Mr. Gibb only sang some back-up occasionally through the album. This is not a duet album as the cover may lead you to believe.
3,Guilty Pleasures,Was happy with the album. I was however disappointed with the CDside of the album as this was the first combo DVD/CD that I have purchased and was unable to play the CD side in any of my CD players. The CD would however play on my PC or DVD player.
1,Does this CD have spyware?,"This CD is possibly copy protected with MediaMax technology which installs files permanently on your computer. These files may act as spyware to report on your listening habits. See:http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=925orhttp://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jhalderm/cd3/Be prudent and check to see what you're getting before buying this or any Sony BMG CD.Note that my sister bought this CD at Costco and it would not play in her OEM Chrysler CD player. So she bought a second one and it wouldn't play either. The label on the CD says that it is a non-standard CD and may not work in some players. Don't reward Sony by buying TWO CD's, like my sister did!!!"
1,"What, no strings??","Their first album together is one of my all-time favorites. This one is truly a mistake. They should be ashamed of themselves.All of the songs have that boom-chucka, boom-chucka BOOM synth background. It's as though they hit the ""start"" button on the synthesizer, sing a bad song, then shut the machine off. The music sounds like the auto-play buttons on a cheap electric organ. And NO strings!! Who ever heard of Striesand singing without strings in the background?"
5,STILL GUILTY....OF MUSICAL PLEASURES,"This CD has been a true gift to Streisand fans..pure pop the way it should be done. The many styles offered on this gem performed, acted out and sung by our diva takes us away to many a place. I've often called a Streisand tune a musical picture and Barbra does not deviate here. Each tune has emotion along with a vivid trip to a place only she can take us....like paradise. For any naysayers who believe Streisand is a thing of the past...this CD will definitely prove them wrong. My only hope is that a newer generation will take notice and step back to other Streisand CDs and experience all that this American treasure has given."
2,Just OK,"The arrangements are much better than the actual music. The arrangements are great and the sound is slick, but the songs are weak. The words most of the time do not make much sense. Striesands voice is intact, however it lacks the depth and strength it used to have. Then again, we all get old and cannot manage the things the same way we used to. It is still nice to hear her do someting rather than the elevator stuff she has fallen into lately (the past 6 years). I bought the CD after reading these reviews on this page. Die hard Striesand lovers are just that."
1,Sorry... but all those 5 stars are just ridiculous,"Think every die hard Barbra fan knows this is Not a great album and trying to safe what can only be discribed this total dissaster of an album.I am a Barbra fan since a star is born... loved the song prisoner (eyes of laura mars) to death, enjoyed her Donna Summer duet still and think 'Guilty' is one of the best albums ever made. Guilty pleasures??? What the hell went wrong... The arrangments sound cheap (what's with those 80's (and not in a good retro way) synth sounds... Barbra's vocals sound lifeless (yes there still is a voice, but what's a voice when the feeling touch is gone?), and the songs are just, well... let's say... the best song in this album would not even be a good filler on the original Guilty.This was my most anticipated release of this year and i'm disspointed beyond.. well everything... This album has the sound of Has-been all over it... sorry Barbra... This project will sell well, but doesn't deserve to"
1,"Barbra is great, but DualDisc is awful","I got the DualDisc versions of both ""Guilty"" and ""Guilty Pleasures"" from Amazon two days ago. I have now returned them both. There is a sticker on the CD case that warns the CD side may not be compatible with many stereo systems, and they were right: The CD side couldn't even be recognized by any of my stereos and CD players. I tried to listen to the music using the DVD side, but this, too, didn't work right. Although the DVD side played, it didn't play correctly, skipping and jerking through songs and videos. I love Barbra Streisand and was eagerly awaiting these discs, but they're no good to me if they don't play on any of my systems. Caveat emptor: Let the buyer beware, at least if you buy the DualDisc versions of ""Guilty Pleasures"" or ""Guilty""."
5,Her best pop album in years,"For those of you who don't know Barbra as a pop singer this is the Album you should listen to. It's the best one in that Genre since ""Til I loved you""(1988) and is better that that one. Nuf said!"
1,Only a diehard Streisand fan...,"I was once a diehard Streisand fan and would find something to love about her work no matter how bad it was. While I agree that Barbra is still in fine voice, the material she has to work with here is weak and boring. The only memorable tune is ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" which is probably why it was chosen as the video and the preview tune used to generate pre-sales of the CD. The rest of the CD is poorly written, derivative Barry Gibb garbage. Perhaps one of the previous reviewers is correct that the tunes will ""grow on you,"" but I am not likely to listen to it often enough to let that happen. The tunes are tedious and the lyrics don't make sense. Barbra is capable of so much more. I wish she hadn't done this one just to make a few million bucks."
1,Toss It,I bought this Streisand joke of a CD & threw it in the trash. Anyone who likes good music will do the same.Save your money--total garbage.
4,GREAT SEQUEL,"Well, they say its not a sequel; they want it to stand alone and it does. Barbra is gorgeous and her voice is stellar as ever. Hideaway is such a lush tune and when she sings the line about going to Rio De Janeiro, it gives me great chills. What a treat!"
5,Guilty Pleasures,"It is great to see Barbra Streisand working with Barry Gibb again, doing what they do best -- make beautiful music in many styles."
3,"Love her, but this album was a bit boring.","The fact of the matter is that Streisand, though definitely not what she was, STILL has some great vocal power left. But you wouldn't know that by this album! Too often she resorts to the airy tones versus the powerful belts. Live, in concert, it's a good way to extend her range, but in a studio there's no excuse. So the album is okay but boring."
2,"Barbra, What Were You Thinking?","I am a big fan of Barbra. Have been since I was a kid and my mom and I would go on road trips and sing along with ""Guilty,"" ""Evergreeen,"" ""People""... etc. I was really looking forward to some new music from Ms. Streisand. I was very disappointed in what I heard. Her normally very agile voice was subdued and lethargic. There was no joy in her song. And then there's Barry Gibb. Get a real voice! The lyrics to the songs are... in a word... bad. It's like a ""word salad."" ""I fight to the end for the night of my life, And nothing can stand in my way, And love has a colour and colours are many, Blue is for lonely and red is for danger."" Hunh?? I've seen a few interviews with Barbra and truthfully she seems depressed, terribly, terribly depressed. I don't think she wanted to do this album and it seems pretty evident. By the way when I bought this album, I also got her ""Essential"" two CD set. I'm loving that!!!"
3,Guilty Pleasures,"I loved the first song ""Come Tomorrow"". The rest is justokay. If you like Barbra and Barry you'll like this CD."
3,"Warm and Romantic,... Sort Of Dull too","Nobody sings like Barbra. It's great she's stillmaking music. Maybe it's my age, but I thought""Guilty"" had a better batch of songs. One of thethings you can always count on with her albumsis very pristine but sterile production. Everythingsounds per-fect. I like ""Letting Go."" Great lyric,great melody. I don't understand why Barry doesn'tcoax her into singing her own background vocals.Her voice harmonizing against her lead wouldsound so much better then the Bee Gees humming behind her."
2,Consider the standard CD version,I purchased the Dual-Disc version of this album which I like very much but had a problem with extracting the disc from my car's CD slot. If you plan to listen to it primarily in the car you might consider the standards CD version. I enjoy the DVD sidefor the interviews and videos but would prefer them on separate discs (like The Movie Album).
2,Pleasant but bland,"I've tried to like this CD, but I just can't. Even the pictures of them on the cover are bad.It's maybe pleasant as background music since nothing stands out or captures your attention.There's currently so many used copies for sale on Amazon Marketplace - the price is down to $0.87. I won't even bother selling mine. I'm going to just through it in the garbage - where it belongs."
3,GrownUpMusic.com recommended!,"The sequel to Streisand's 1980s love-fest with Barry Gibb is infinitely more listenable than other recent efforts (""The Movie Album,"" ""Christmas Memories""). It is in many ways like the original: Bee Gees-esque songs and lush pop arrangements, Gibb's creepy castrati ooh-ing and ahh-ing on the high notes, and Barbra as the ersatz Robin Gibb (or Yvonne Elliman) on lead vocals. There's a little Streisand politics here (""Strangers in a Strange Land"" is an homage to US soldiers in Iraq) and a little Bee Gees nostalgia there (a 70s-esque, Fender Rhodes-laden remake of ""Our Love - Don't Throw It All Away)."" The CD defines ""Adult Contemporary"" and - like its predecessor - is that rare pop album sure to garner radio play for decades. The disturbing thing is: nearly all of the songs were penned by Gibb and his sons, Ashley and Stephen, which may mean that Barry is breeding a master race of big-haired boys armed with power falsetto and catchy musical hooks."
1,Should be a Negative One Star,"While Babs does have great voice every song sounds alike. We agree with some of the other comments about weak, dull and boring. Don't buy this. Maybe your local library will stock this and you could borrow it before you buy."
1,Save your money and listen to her earlier albums.,"I did not enjoy this cd at all. Her voice is good-selection of songs ""poor"". It is a cd that you listen to once or twice and forget about it."
1,Big Disappointment.....,"I bought this CD because of Barry Gibb only. Although I loved the songs he did with Barbra Streisand previously, I am not a big fan of hers. I have been waiting for Barry Gibb to come out of his grieving time for brother Maurice and do what he does best...make music. However, the two songs that he sings with Ms. Streisand are not what I would consider his best work. His wonderful voice is barely heard over hers, and the songs are well....just BORING!I am a die hard Gibb fan, but this was not Barry Gibb's best work at all. He is capable of so much more!!"
1,Barbara's out for more money,Don't waste your money on this item unless you really want to complete your collection. I suggest get out of being stuck in the past and explore newer realms of modern music where hard-work and dedication is actually involved!
3,Not Nearly as Good as the First,"I truely enjoyed The Legend, but The Legend 2 was lacking something that the original movie had.The thing that really annoys me though, is that there is no original language track, and Dubbing is never very accurate."
1,"Ugh, Disney ruins another classic","Fong Sai Yuk 2 is my favorite Jet Li movie bar none. I'd give it 6 stars out of 5. Why do I enjoy it so much? Because in addition to a lot of wonderful over the top martial arts you get a tremendous amount of hilarity and top shelf comedic acting from both Jet Li and Josephine Siao, who plays his mother. Sadly, the english dubbing of this version of the movie re-titled apparently at random by Disney as ""The Legend 2"" eliminates Li and Siao's priceless performances. What you get instead is 10th rate otherwise-unemployed American actors stumbling their way through a lot of generic, sanitized dialogue in the footage which remains after much of the comedy has been edited out. That's right, actual footage has been edited out of this version. Sheesh. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this version of the movie. Look for the original language, subtitled, uncut version entitled ""Fong Sai Yuk 2"" which is available from various online sources."
3,"great action, but not a ""real"" sequel","This movie is ok in its own right, with spectacular fighting scenes, but I confess I was a bit disappointed since it looks more like a remake of Fong Sai Yuk than its sequel. In the first movie Sai Yuk wins a wife in a kung fu fight, here it wins another one..... and then he saves one of his parents from being executed (the father in the first part, the mather here). All fights are excellent and comedy is ok, although I preferred the gags in the first movie: here some of them get ways too silly, like Sai Yuk's mother believing of being 9th month pregnant just after a few days.....Overall, I think this movie can be recommended only to true Jet's fans (they will not be disappointed!): for anyone else, the original Fong Sai Yuk (aka The legend) is probably a better choice to enjoy one of the best HK action movies made so far."
2,Like Sitting in the Dentist Chair,"I've been a fan of Lescroats for a few years now. I really did enjoy reading works like The First Law and The Hearing. However,I just couldn't get excited about this work. The plot was a bit unrealistic while a great chunk of the novel was void of intense dialogue and a few action scenes for good measure. Lescroats disappointed me in this one. Fortunately, I bought this book at a used book sale for a buck thirty and do not feel too cheated."
4,Ashley,"This book is about a 14 year old boy named Philip Malloy.He goes to Harrison high in new Hampshire.Philip is in the 9th grade whenhe starts to be disrespectful.He tells a lie and it turns in to a big mess.I like this book and I think if you read it,you willlike it too."
4,Great Mysteries,I like the characters in the Dismas Hardy series. The stories are always great and keep me turning the pages to the end.
2,Didn't hold my interest,"I've read about 6 of his books, and this one was not good. The plot wasn't developed enough and couldn't hold my interest. Then the author spent way too much time getting into the ethanol/alcohol aspect of the story. It was too long of a book."
5,Fast-Reading Intelligent Story is Unputdownable,"Lescroart's books have had a wide-ranging degree of success. This new one, like The Mercy Rule before it, seems to show that Lescroart's talent is coming in to full bloom. An exremely well-written, intelligent book and it's also a page-turner! I wish other authors of legal suspense would adapt Lescroart's style and realize that behind really good books are characters we care about."
1,anklet,Ankle bracelett broke after one week of wear due to a weak link. Was not the quality I was expecting
4,Not bad,This book was very well written and thought out. I had a hard time putting it down. But I did feel that it wasn't long enough. The author could have developed her characters and the story line so much more with a few more pages.
5,Great Show until the End,"Season 5 of the Girls Next Door doesn't disappoint and of course the commentary of the girls for each episode is the icing on the cake (as Bridget likes to say). We have followed these 3 Girls during part of their exciting life at the Playboy Mansion and it helped to give some insight on what it's like to be one of Hef's girlfriends. With Kendra now being married, Bridget having her own Travel show and Holly just starting her stint on ""Peepshow"" in Vegas I can only hope that the next season with the new girlfriends will make us smile as these three did!"
3,"Too much ""Virgin Eyes""","I did enjoyed the 5th season, however, on the commentary, it was a little disappointing that at some points none of the girls had seen the episodes, so they were watching with ""virgin eyes."" There were several times with no comments because the girls were watching the episode and quite a few times saying ,""oh they didn't show this or are they going to show that."" And freqently asking each other, 'what was that? what did he/she just say?'Also, the 2-part episode with Kendra and Bridget moving out is not included at all. Maybe they are considered part of season 6."
3,The end of the giggle-fest.,"They were fun to watch, especially when they kissed and hugged Hef. Kind of like watching necrophilia.....but still fun."
3,NO Hot Chocolate (Pam Anderson) for you.,I bought season because I wanted to see the Hot Chocolate episode. It was Hef's 82 birthday and Pamela Anderson served him a cup cake and hot chocolate while totally nude. For what ever reason that episode was omitted from the DVD. If I had known that episode was not included I wouldn't have purchased the season.
1,Season 5 is Missing 5 Episodes!,"They should be required to let you know that they left the best 5 episodes off this product. There were 21 episodes in season 5, and you only get 16 episodes! This is just not right."
2,"Love the show, but season incomplete","I love this show and was looking forward to the last season on DVD. The only issues were 1) The packaging isn't that great 2) IT'S MISSING EPISODES! The original season had 21 episodes but his box set ONLY HAS 16!! I was rather disappointed that they didn't include the last two ""Transition"" episodes."
4,YAY,"This DVD was cool, very enjoyable for the 2nd to last season of Holly, Bridget, and Kendra! They will be missed!"
4,Great stories!,"This is a fun book. I love the one story per page format and the layout: business topic, story, and lesson learned. I haven't seen this format before.This would be an excellent text book or just a fun read for anyone interested in international business, international affairs, or even international travel."
5,Wunderbar,"Being in international banking myself and doing the same thing as the author, I found the stories to be most amusing and ones I could relate to based on my experience. I know the author and have worked with him on other projects and find him to be very sincere. This book makes an excellent reference tool and is easy to follow."
4,A good start,"Being one to generally dislike ""beginner's guides"" I make an exception for this one. Maybe because when it comes to dragonflies, I am a beginner.The photos are generally of good quality and the key in the front of the book helps narrow down a specimen to the proper family without resorting to some of the quirky systems in some other field guides I have seen.It obviously doesn't show you everything you might see, but so far everything I have seen has been in this book.On advantage is it also contains damselflies. I would like to see Stokes come out with a full-blown field guide (or two, one for east and one for west) for dragonflies. Hopefully this is a first step in that direction.Botton line, if you have an interst in answering, ""What is that?"" when you see one of these beauties in the wild, this book is a good starting point and at very comfortable price."
4,Stokes Beginner's Guide to Dragonflies,Excellent identification book for beginners. Simple information concepts and good location maps with each dragonfly picture.
4,For Beginners,"A nice little book, well formatted, but it certainly is for beginners. There are lots of dragonflies not mentioned in the book."
4,Great Dragonfly Identifier,"Need to put a name to the Dragonflies, this is the guide to carry into the field to help you."
3,"Looks pretty nice, quality is not great","I recently received this item. My review is essentially that it looks fairly nice and doesn't take up that much space, but the quality isn't great. My unit is a little lopsided and tilts to the side a but, basically leaning a little. There isn't enough weight on the bottom to give it any sturdiness.The assembely wasn't too bad, took me 2 hours but probably can be done in an hour.Overall, I am not completely dissapointed in my purchase, but would probably not purchase it again knowing what I know now."
4,Great purchase!,"Everything was packaged well, the instructions were easy to read/follow and it looks great once its all put together. Could use more space for glasses but thats my only complaint."
3,Good Product for Price,"I purchased this tower to match a bar set that I bought from another dealer. The color perfectly matched the picture and description. The process to build it was a little time-consuming, but I was able to do it with only myself, even though the directions did call for 2 people. The tower looks really nice with my previously purchased bar, but it scratches extremely easily. (and its not the same color the finish) Its a little flimsy, but I imagine with the base filled with wine it will become more stable. Overall, it was a good purchase. But it didn't blow me away either. Good for its purpose."
5,Beautiful Wine Rack,It was easy enough to put together. I did it by myself with no help. It just takes several hours to screw everything in. I'm pretty sure I was swearing at the hex nuts half way through. But it's beautiful and elegant and I finally have room for my wine and a place to display my liquor and martini glasses/accessories.
3,"Amazing movie...good picture, lousy horrible sound","Everything that others have said about the quality is this fine Western satire is true. Amazing movie. Problem here is on a standard TV, the sound is unlike any other Universal DVD title I own: horrible tinny, hallow and echoey unacceptable sound.Someonje really screwed up during the mastering process. (I have checked two copies and they are both hallow sounding...)"
5,A wonderful film with an outstanding cast,"This was the movie that introduced Stewart to the Western. In addition, it revitalized Deitrich's career. Donlevy had a banner year in 1939 with this film, BEAU GESTE, JESSE JAMES, and UNION PACIFIC. The marvelous supporting cast of Winninger, Carson, and Auer stands out. This is a film to show people who don't care for Westerns. Including in the book ""Head `Em Off At the Pass! 94 Westerns You Should Watch.""Head `Em Off At the Pass!: 94 Westerns You Should Watch"
4,"""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have.""","With the help of Frenchy (Marlene Dietrich) a dance hall girl from New Orleans, local ranchers in the town of Bottleneck are being swindled out of there land by the unscrupulous saloon owner Kent (Brian Donlevy).Sheriff Keogh (Joe King) attempts to correct this and suddenly leaves town without his body.Judge Slade (Samuel S. Hinds) who is in cahoots with Kent assigned the job of sheriff to the town drunk. Newly assigned Sheriff Washington Dimsdale (Charles Winninger) remembers a previous sheriff named Tom Destry and sends off for the son of Destry, Thomas Jefferson 'Tom' Destry Jr. (James Stewart).On the day of Destry's arrival with all the crowds are waiting in anticipation. Destry steps out of the coach with a parasol and a bird cage. Sheriff Dimsdale thinks he may have made a mistake.Only time will tell.I personally think there is more to this film than the surface story and subplots. It has a good after taste.Cheyenne Social Club [VHS]"
4,Marlene at her best,"I always had a bit of a crush for the pre-war James Stewart and I was never partial to Marlene Dietrich. But in this movie I simply don't like the character James Stewart plays, or the way he plays it. I can not remember the girl he ends up with at all and I actually think Marlene Dietrich's character is too good for him - for once, she has a genuine sparkle in her eyes and some human warmth, some life in her, instead of that blasé, bedroom eyes look on her face.How I love to see her singing ""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will have"" and brawling and looking at people with her eyes open. To see her move at all is a good change from that impressive stillness she cultivated. I wish she had given us more of the persona she exhibits in this picture."
4,Not at all like the book,"This has a totally different screen play as the book which is disappointing. Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining and Jimmy Stewart is ... well Jimmy Stewart."
5,A classic book without a shelf-life,"Recommended to me as a child by my dad, I put this book up there with Ender's Game, and Starship Troopers. Short, sweet, and a well done story. The main character is not the easiest to relate to, but his utter humanity is. This book feels like a short story in that it delves directly into the meat of the story relatively quickly and refrains from taking too many twists and turns. You'll probably finish the book in a single sitting, but it is worth the time!"
1,Not that durable.,"This cheap thing broke the second we took it out of the box. The light never worked and the platic saber part fell off while he was playing with it. He didnt care he just taped it up, but I wouldn't spend the money on it again."
2,Lightsaber. What lightsaber?,"This toy didn't last 10 minutes. We gave it to our 5 year old for christmas. The second time he went to extend it, the lightsabor (red) part went flying across the room and almost hit our 2 year old in the head. He wasn't even playing rough with it. I do not recommend for children."
2,junky,It has less quality than the cheap ones bought at an department store. I assume this is meant for an adult that only plans to dress as Count Dooku on Halloween and not for a six year old that will actually play with it.
1,Disappointed!,"We had great difficulty finding a Count Dooku lightsaber for our 8 year old for Xmas, in the UK, so decided to try further afield. It may have been shortsighted on my part, but when I read the description and saw the total price, including shipping, I assumed that it would have been the same as the lightsabers my son already had! But, this one is one of the cheap ones you can obtain in Toys R Us for 5.00! In total, including shipping, I paid approx 30 so am deeply disappointed! When I contact the seller, they advised that the cost of shipping was the bulk of it and if I wanted a refund I would have to pay the return shipping costs so in essence it wouldn't be worthwhile. I may as well have flushed the 30 down the toilet.As this was one of our son's Xmas presents, I am really sad that this product wasn't what I thought it would be. I will think twice before buying from here again!Please read the description 'very carefully' before buying!!!!"
2,It came in a damaged package,"I bought this for my nephew who turned 5. When I recieved it, I was concerned that it had already been opened because the package was damaged. I'm still not sure if it was previously used. We had a hard time trying to figure out how to turn it on. Once we did turn it on, you could hardly tell because the light was so dim. The only time you can tell it's on is when you are in the dark."
4,Hard to say if it's work,"My 2-year old son has started a day care recently.And he started to get sick every other week. I was looking around to find something to pick up his immunity. It's hard to find anything without the corn ingredients, to which my son has allergy. Finally i found this line ChildLife.I called them and they assure me that there are no corn ingredients.So i bought it.We finished the first bottle.Right on the last day he got sick.Some virus.But this time we were done in 1.5 days.So i would say it works,not 100 %,but certainly improves things.It has pleasant taste,he took it with no problem/My only complain- something wrong with the bottle itself.Every time you pouring the liquid some amount goes on to label.So by the end all label was dirty. And i was trying hard to save every drop of this pretty expensive medication.Price here is much lower than in my neighborhood nature pharmacy."
4,Seems to work. No colds since starting the bottle.,"I have tried several other natural or organic vitamin supplements for my 3 year old who started preschool and was getting sick a lot. Nothing worked. I was shocked to find some of the supplements I tried had a moderate amount of lead in them (FDA study of vitamins). I wanted to keep ingredients all natural with no additives or possible lead. My toddler cannot be coaxed into eating a daily vitamin even if it looks like a gummy bear or a berry and powders contain lead so a liquid seemed ideal and could be hidden in juice, etc. This product really does seem to work. No colds since starting the bottle. And no struggle with eating a daily vitamin."
3,"Pretty and well-made, but nonstandard sizing.","When my husband put his first one on, he noticed right away that his motion was limited. When I compared these shirts with my husband's LLBean, Alfani, Van Heusen, Lands End and Geoffrey Beene shirts, I saw that across the shoulders these shirts are exactly right. But at the level of the armpits, the circumference around the chest of these shirts is 5-6"" smaller compared to the major brand name shirts. That means that the sizing around the chest of these shirts is about 1-2 sizes smaller than standard (since standard sizes increase 4"" for each size). These may fit the guy with broad shoulders and skinny chest."
4,emotionally satisfying medieval,"This is Helen Kirkman's debut novel and is well worth checking out. Kirkman knows her medieval/Dark Ages history (she's an Englishwoman from Chesire) but doesn't make too many allowances for those who might not. It's not that hard to follow what is happening but a quick glimpse at a history of the times might help with the political situation and customs of the day.The book is more a character driven story and to be honest,not a lot really ""happens."" It's mainly interactions betweenthe hero and heroine as they learn about each other. Mostof the conflict is believable and the miscommunications areunderstandable because of the nature of the times andthe characters. As I said, there is a whole lot of thinkingand observing at first and if you get impatient with thattype of novel, this one might not be for you. But I foundthe ending to be emotionally satisfying and can see ahappy future for Sigrid and Leifwin."
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"I only read to the first 50 pages and couldn't go on. For the year 917 their speech was very modern. I also didn't feel a connection between the H/H. And yes, maybe I did quit too soon to discern the connection, but I found my mind wandering while reading. Finally I realized even if I did finish the book I really wouldn't remember what it was about because it couldn't hold my attention. In addition, there was more description than dialog. I prefer equal amounts. I know this book received high ratings on Amazon.com, but for me, it fell short of my expectations."
5,Neck Pain Relief,"The Elasto-gel Collar is great. Put it in the freezer, when you develop a neck pain, take it out and wrap around the neck. Instant relief, no mess."
3,Could be smaller for women,"I had high hopes for this product because I ice my neck almost every day on my commute to work. I liked the idea of the velcro in front to keep the ice pack in place. But it's too big around for a woman's neck. I feel like I'm choking by the time I get it cinched up enough. And it doesn't get very cold, even after being in the freezer over night. I haven't tried it as a hot pack yet."
4,"Great product, just bought a second one","I got my father-in-law one of these two years ago, since he suffers from a degenerated disc in his neck. He uses it every day to help relieve the pain. I just bought a second one so he can keep one in the freezer here at our house and won't have to suffer when he's away from home.It's made of heavy nylon/plastic, which doesn't seem to get brittle with age. The gel inside gets a little stiff but still bendable when frozen, and it stays cold for about an hour. It re-freezes quickly and folds so it doesn't take up too much room in the freezer. The shape of it is perfect for neck and shoulders, and it's not too heavy on his neck.A great product - nice enough that I bought a second one."
2,Not good as a cold pack,"I bought this to use as a cold pack. The collar just feels cool at best, even immediately after taking it from the freezer, when it's been there overnight.Just so so fit, too. Rides high on back and away from neck.Didn't try it for a hot pack, it might be better for this."
2,"Nice idea, but lousy thermal retention","I loved the idea of this product, and it does fit nicely (although it's a little big for my neck, but I'm a small woman) which is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one star. This product simply does not get cold enough, and the little bit of chill it does reach, only lasts for 10 minutes at most. Same goes for the heating. As well, I recently put it in the microwave for 2 minutes to heat it up as directed, and on one of the creases, the gel/plastic somehow started to burn, pop and smoke. We also purchased the wrap around version for your leg, and it used a different type of polyester material (the neck one was cotton) to house the gel pack, and that material is completely snagged from the velcro strap and looks awful after only a few uses. If we could, we'd return them."
2,"great idea, but not effective","This item advertises to be exactly what cervical neck pain sufferers need but it does not live up to its description.The concept is excellent but the fit is awkward, complicated and does not hold the cold or really get that cold. The add says 20F but I seriously doubt it. Other reviews mention it not staying warm either. We thought the cold might be more lasting but it wasn't. Try something else."
3,I did not know the exact product,I wanted a stiff collar. I did not know the product. Product description should be more informative.I returned it back via my American Express.
3,It's alright,"I thought this would be perfect for my neck and shoulders. I would have preferred the rice sock I had previously. It was easier to wrap around and place it. I have terrible problems with my upper neck. I can barely keep this on up there.So, it's alright, but for the price, I should have stuck with the cheapy."
2,Not so Cool,This looked like the perfect solution to early morning neck pain. Wrong. What it is is a non-messy alternative to real ice packs that will provide a bit of coolness for a short period of time. Back to the ice bags for me.
1,Worthless,"Much easier to wrap baggies of ice in a towel, or use a heating pad. More effective too. I expected more."
3,Not so good at staying cold,"I bought this specifically for cold therapy, and it does not stay cool for the 15-20 minutes I need. The gel seems to absorb the body heat emitted from one's body very well (better than a bag o'peas), so if you can put this on and not emit body heat, you're good.It is designed to absorb heat (which is why it works for heat therapy) as well as cold, but when the two are encountered by the gel, heat wins out. The collar likely works fine hot, though I have not used it for that purpose.It's designed well to cover the cervical spine area.Right now, I've got a frozen peas on the area and that does a far better job at staying cold for the 15-20 min. I need. I don't regret buying it - if I ever need heat therapy, this is a good buy. But for cold therapy, a bag o'peas, though cumbersome, stays cold longer."
1,Doesn't stay cold,"Hi AllI thought they were the right cold pack because I was looking for some way to close the ends. This product does that, but the only problem is that I left the cold pack overnight in the freezer and It didn't stay cold for twenty minutes on my neck. Very dissapointing"
5,Elast-gel Cervical Collar,"Freeze it in the freezer and great for neck pain and stiffness and headaches. Only use for up to 30-minutes at one time.Enjoy,Dr. Ken"
5,Can't do without !,"I bought this after having used one at the Occupational therapy appointments. It is well-balanced, has great coverage, heats evenly(I haven't tried it chilled). I have a LOT of tension in my neck, pinching nerves which causes paralysis in my arms, and my entire C-spine is degenerated. This definitely gives relief."
2,neck brace,"Great concept, but it feels like a whip-lash neck brace. I can't wear it long enough to get the benefit without feeling clastrophobic. I still use it, just not secured around my neck. Could be very useful for wrapping a knee or shoulder though. If I turn it upside down, it snuggles around the neck much nicer."
4,Best cold pack I have found.,I own two of these cold packs that I keep in the freezer at all times. They keep flexible when cold and conform to your body. I use them for neck inflamation and pain. I have had one for several years and have not noticed any wear. I picked up this second one so I will have one always avalible.
4,Not quite perfect,"Unlike other products; I doesn't leak, it's more durable, lasts longer, it's more comfortable, BUT is just doesn't get cold enough for me."
1,Crap cervical collar,"I have the elasto gel eye thing, 4"" roll and the foot wrap.. All are great. The cervical neck thing is crap. It has a cotton cover unlike the others and barely gets cold even after you lay it on yourself for a while and it's not comfortable with the elastic attached. Don't buy! I wish I could return it. Try the cervical by chattooga col pac, I have two I luv."
2,"not cold enough, bulky","I thought this product would be great compared to simple ice packs which we have to hold with our hand onto the sore spot. However this just does not get cold enough. Its only mildly cold, not ice cold - which is required for treating pains.plus the package is bulky. I wish they could make is slimmer less heavy."
5,Fantastic,"I bought this to provide some relief for my headaches and migraines It stays cold for about 20 minutes and cool for a while (just as they say). It is soft, flexible, and pretty thick. I'm very glad I bought this.In case you have doubts this CAN go in the freezer and it does stay flexible and comfortable. I have not used it hot yetMy only warning/negative is if you have issues with constriction around your neck you might want to reconsider. It isn't overly tight as it is adjustable but the still could be a bit snug on someone with a larger neck, the issue mainly comes with how wide the collar around the front of the neck. My mother was unable to use for this reason but for me the relief far out weighed the mild discomfort."
2,disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this item. I bought for an ice collar and it is not cold, cool but not cold. Additionally it is very uncomfortable but in all fairness I used it at night in bed, may be more comfortable when up."
4,As advertised but may be too small for thick necks.,My wife and I like the unit but if your neck is thick my be too small to actually feel comfortable if secured by strap. Still can be used sitting/laying on area while siting in chair or laying in bed.Effective in cooling hot heads.
1,"Waste of money, doesn't get cold enough to be beneficial.",I am a pediatric physical therapist who suffered whiplash when rear-ended in a car accident. This sounded like a great product. Ordered it and was disappointed. My frozen bag of peas does a better job. It doesn't get cold enough to numb the back of my neck. Will be paying to send this back but it's a waste of money.
1,Item Shown Was Not What Was Shipped,"I've been ordering Elasto-Gel collars for years for a friend who suffered a neck injury. Elasto-Gel collars have two different types of covers: one is a bright blue (as shown) satin material that is gentle on the skin; the other is a much rougher dark blue material that causes him skin irritation.I ordered this item because the picture depicted the bright blue satin material, but I actually received the dark blue rough material. Very disappointing."
3,Great idea but the Velco is scratchy,"I'm sure I can rig a way to get the Velcro parts off my neck, but you'd think they would have considered this design element. It doesn't get or stay too cold--especially if you're up walking about and not leaning against a pillow or chair back to help target the cold therapy. You can add a second gel pack underneath this one to intensify the cold (or heat)"
3,Not as bulky as I though it'd be,it holds heat and cold pretty well. for some reason i thought the picture made the item look full but mine is a different color and very thin and flat. because of this it actually doesnt even make contact with the majority of my cervical spinus processes which is where i need some direct contact. it certainly gets cool in the area underneath the collar but its not nearly what i was hoping for. i'll certainly continue to use it from time to time but i will also be keeping my eyes open for something more substantial that actually provides me with some significant relief. right now my best cold treatment is an ice bag awkwardly strapped around C7.
2,ok...could be better,"frozen overnite & when taken out of freezer, only was cold for 1-2 minutes.heat was a little better.it fit really well, better than it held cold & heat..."
4,Muscle relaxing neck collar,"After looking at several drug stores,I was happy to find this product on Amazon because I had used it extensively at friends to relax my neck muscles following a whip-lashing rear-ender auto accident. It fits nicely around the neck and also drops down a bit onto the upper back. It is easy to warm up in the microwave and it is warm enough to relax muscles but not so hot as to burn. I have not used it cold, but I am sure it works equally well on neck and upper back."
2,elasto gel cervical collar,itwas a fast easy transaction i was just disappointed in the item itself it only stays cold for a very short time and i was hoping for something longer lasting thanks for the prompt service though.
3,Needs improvement,"I bought this for my husband who has had 2 neck surgeries within the last 4 years. He said that the collar fits perfectly and is very comfortable, but does not stay warm as long as promised. He warmed it in the microwave according to the instructions (making sure not to overheat it) and said that it lost all of it's heat in between 5 and 10 minutes. It was promised to stay warm for at least 20 minutes! He was disappointed because he said it would be perfect if it would just stay warmer longer."
2,Not cold enough to be considered an ice pack...,"This item has a couple of faults, which is why I only gave it two stars. The first, glaring weakness is that it doesn't get cold enough to consider it ice therapy. I didn't purchase this item with heat therapy in mind, so if that's what you're looking for then this review is not for you. But if you are looking for the same type of therapy as putting an icepack on your neck, then look elsewhere. It gets very cool, but not ice cold. The second problem is that this thing is a little too large, and I have a larger than average neck for a man."
3,ice for hard places,The neck collar is convenient for the back of the neck but it chokes me when I velcro it the right way. This product should fasten off the front of the throat. I hook it incorrectly to make it work. I also do not feel it gets very cold. I have read that heat/ice items do not get very cold.Sandy
2,Rabbit doesn't like it,My rabbit ignored it; Cube of hay sat in the corner of his cage for a week untouched...Guess he is just an uncompressed hay type of bunny. Not for all bunnies apparently!
2,Self Centered,"My title says it all. Here is a autobiography of Mr. perfect. He may have been a great sculptor and craftsman, but in his estimation no one is better. Gets boring after a while and I can only read it for short periods of time."
2,Not a 100 count humidor!,"I was a bit surprised to see how small this humidor is compared to the size it's advertised at. I was able to fit 60 cigars into this box. And not 60 churchills, but a combination of 60 cigars of all sizes. I contacted the seller and was told that the product is listed as 100 count by manufacturer. Hmmm... Now, to the hydrometer. There is no way to adjust it. After I calibrated it by following the instructions, I came up with a reading of 95 being the ideal point. So now, even though the arrow points to 68 and 72, I'm making sure mine holds around 95. As far as the actual humidifier, it worked well for the first couple of months. Then all of sudden a started getting what looked like a small amount of mold! I only use distilled water, so I promptly chucked it and picked up another one.Pluses: Looks awesome, and the drawer is great for storing accessories, even if it's not flush when closed."
1,Not a good choice,"I've never had any luck keeping humidity in this humidor. The hygrometer never has worked right either. It's pretty, but I wouldn't recommend it for good smokes."
2,Outdated by Wikipedia,"In 1999, when this was published, there was not much high-quality online material of this type. Now there is lots, including Wikipedia. I purchased this to read the overview papers, which I found elementary and pedagogical---not useful for research. I read a sampling of entries and found them fragmented and rather elementary. Thus, this book (like many other 'encyclopedia' type books, are superannuated. I will donate my copy to charity."
3,"some mark, but fair eought","the book i bought is not bad regarding the price, had some mark on it, overall it is not bad"
5,MARIAH'S DA '[GREATEST],"I LOVE THIS CD . I THINK AFTER ALL THE HARDSHIP THAT MARIAH HAS BEEN THROUGH SHE STILL CAME BACK TO HER MUSIC. MARIAH IS AN INSPIRATION PERSONALLY TO ME . I LOVE HER VOICE AND THE WAY SHE USES HER VOCALS . NOT MANY PEOPLE SOUND LIKE HER AND THAT MAKES HER A TRUE SINGER ,BECAUSE SHE IS UNIQUE .SHE HAS A GREAT TALENT IN WRITING MUSIC AND SINGING.I RATE THIS CD AS A 5+. I ALSO LOVE THE VIDEO SHE MADE FOR ""THROUGH THE RAIN"" WHICH WAS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.THERES SOME REALLY GOOD BALLADS LIKE "" MY SAVING GRACE"".SHE ALSO MIXED ALITTLE RAP INTO THE SONGS ""BOY"" AND""YOU GOT ME"" . SHE HAS ONE SONG WITH MICHAEL THOMPSON WHO PLAYS THE CLASSIC GUITAR AND ITS A NICE ROMANTIC SONG. SHE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB ON THIS CD AND THERES NO WAY ANYONE SAY NEGATIVE THINGS CAUSE HONUSTLY THIS CD IS DA [GREATEST]."
5,TOUCHING AND BEAUTIFUL!!!,"This song is so beautiful. I totally agree with one reviewer who said that this song isn't hip hop, or r n' b,or a power ballad.It's just a truly beautiful song with heartfelt lyrics.The first time I heard this song, it drove me to tears, and now everytime I hear it, I still tear up-that's how beautiful it is.And after all the dissapointment with Mariah and Rainbow,Glitter and the whole skank hip hop thing, I am so impressed that Mariah took the time to ""make it through the rain"".I have no doubt that the album will be incredible. And God, Mariah sings it incredibly, really this is probably the best vocal performance she has done so far.Whether you need to mkae it through the rain or not, this is an incredible song that will make you feel like you can do anything."
5,Relaxing Christmas Music,"Five CD set from Laserlight is a true Christmas treasure! Many of these pieces I had never heard of, but the selections and performances are excellent. I am sure you will enjoy this set."
4,Great Author; Defective Edition,"This book in my opinion is one of the greatest commentary of the book of Romans. Even though Robert Haldane doesn't have many published books his thoughts and comments are in harmony within God's word and the Epistle Paul's writings. Haldane focuses on God's sovreignty, hitting all points of Total Depravity of man; Unconditional Election; Limited Atonement; Irrestible Grace; Perserverance of the Saint's! Unfortunately this edition has a flaw in it which I found after purchasing it. There are pages between 150-191 that are missing. I'm awaiting for the refund of this purchase and after the flaw is fixed I'm planning on buying it again. It's perfect for anyone who wants to dig deep into God's word, picking the meat off the bones. Will go good in your library, and recommend any pastor to follow up on this commentary."
5,Easy walk harness,The product came in great condition.. just as described.. Now if only my puppy would walk properly!! I hope this helps.
5,I ALWAYS KEEP A FEW ON HAND,I DON'T THINK OF THESE AS TOYS. THEY ARE GREAT LOOKING ON THE REFRIGERATOR. THE MAGNETS HOLD PICTURES ETC.WELL. I GIVE THEM TO MY FRIENDS WHO REALLY GET A KICK OUT OF THEM!
3,Good not great,Does the job but takes a lot longer than the last one we had (limited movement of handle) and there's a ridge at the bottom that collects the flower and can be a bit messy to clean.
2,Well.... Dunno.....,"I used to like Tiziano Ferro Songs. His first album was a straight hit in the face, a WOW! Great dinamic songs. 111 was more normal, more calm. But this one is really really slow... He changed his usual pop style for a R&B; that doesn't convince a lot.If you like calm balads or are a fan of Tiziano, then you'll like it, but if you don't.... Better don't buy it."
4,This movie is awesome!,I love movies that start with a flash-back of the ending and then unwind the story. This is truly one of those movies that will have you smiling at the end because you never saw the twist coming. A must watch Denzel Washington movie.
3,Interesting Concept with some good acting,"Fallen takes the genre of ""Celestials"" one step forward, and makes a ""Fallen Angel"" the perpetrator of many serial murders. Denziel Washington plays the detective that has stumbled across this Fallen Angel's path this time. This criminal is unique in that he can pass from body to body with the merest touch...making anyone and everyone a possible threat to Denziel's character. An enjoyable thriller with and interesting concept. Recommended. END"
3,Not bad.,Kind of slow moving and drugged out. I am not sure that I would recommend this movie to my friend.
5,Loved It,Denzel Washington is at his best in this movie. I hadn't seen it in a long time and watching it again was just as enjoyable as the 1st time.
2,There are better movies!,"The movie has problems with continuity, it goes from fast to slow in weird pacing jumps. The story is weak at best tho there are a few good parts. John Goodman is almost completely wasted in his role, Denzel's part wasn't much better. The acting is great in spite of the directing, and there are a few good scenes written in to the story but overall it's just not very satisfying. The ending was juvenile. Hah! If you want a better action flick watch Barbarella again!"
3,3.5,"A decent suspense thriller with a host of good actors including: Denzel, Tony Soprano, John Goodman, Tony Soprano's sister, and Don Sutherland. I liked the ending until they threw one last surprise on it which changed everything. Another criticism is that this movie could be a lot better now with contemporary movie technology. It's not too old, but old enough you can tell it's old. That being said, Fallen has good movie speed and keeps you interested."
5,AMAZING!,"A movie filled with suspense, action and creepiness...yes, that's Fallen. It never fails to get you involved. Denzel displays an unforgettable performance!"
3,Something Just isn't Right,"The story line is compelling in this psychological thriller, yet something is off.After some thought it occurs ot me you have the wrong mix of actors in this film. For whatever reason I just can't picture Denzel Washington as a serious intellect as a detective. His typical role as a tough guy cop ruins it for me in this film. Couple that with funny man John Goodman as his partner and it just does not work.The plot calls for Vincent D' Offrino as Robert Goren."
2,Good until the ending,"I was thoroughly enjoying this movie until the very end. If you actually listen to the ways that Denzel can stop Azazel, you will realize that the ending is silly and doesn't have to turn out that way. That ruined the entire thing for me. I don't want to give away any clues about the movie, but seriously- don't be surprised if the ending is a giant disappointment."
3,Confusion About The Demonic,"Technically a good, well-made movie, well acted. However ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" & the writer (Nicholas Kazan?) knows very little concerning the demonic - but enough to turn the movie into chaotic confusion. The writing is sensationalistic according to much of what we can expect from Hollywood, but it further muddies the waters about knowledge about the demonic. Demons cannot be killed & do not die.Furthermore, no one enters heaven because they ""deserve"" to do so (as a little boy was told about his dad in this film), though Hollywood insissts on promulgating that lie in film after film. Anyone actually entering heaven does so ONLY because of belief in God's grace based on what Jesus did for them.""Thumbs down"" on this movie except for ite technical aspects."
3,Does this make sense to you?,"If you were the devil inside a human body and could merely touch someone else and pass your spirit on to them, don't you think you would do so as soon as your host was first arrested instead of serving a prison term all the way through to the moment of execution? Wouldn't you want to get out and create mayhem and at least eat a decent meal? The acting in the film is fine by Washington and Goodman and the cinematography is top-notch but can we please have a movie with a plot that someone put a bit of thought into? Please!"
4,Suspenseful Exciting Horror that gets under your skin,"Fallen is smart, exciting, and genuinely frightening. Denzel Washington and John Goodman give stellar performances in this creepy flick. The film is NOT predictable and stands as one of the best most intelligent horror films of the 90s."
3,So-so,"Touted as supernatural thriller / film noir, FALLEN hasn't dated well at all. The truth is: the show while beautifully filmed, is too tame and slow to generate any real thrills. The average viewer would get more suspense out of watching an episode of CSI. The film fails primarily because it tries to incorporate too many genres and falls short in each.The only reason to watch this movie of course is Denzel Washington - who's never had a bad performance. The able cast around him - Donald Sutherland, John Goodman, James Gandolfini et al - don't do much either. The film is ultimately very PG in treatment, which works against it. Denzel fans will get their fix, but that's about it.Try Angel Heart for a more cryptic fix."
4,Good Movie,"I looked through the other reviews and was amazed that no one else had mentioned the big underlying theme to this movie. Coffee. Nearly every scene has someone drinking coffee. Amazing. Aside from that, it was a very good movie."
2,"INTERESTING PREMISE, BUT SLOW MOVING AND TOO LONG!","I liked this film somewhat and thought the premise was very interesting. The cast is excellent, but the pacing is slow and everyone involved seems to be too calm considering what's going on. The film suffers from being too long and a good 20 minutes trimmed off would have helped a great deal. Denzel Washington holds it all together in this ultimately predictable thriller, but I doubt I would sit through it a second time. I rate it 2 1/2 stars for a good premise and cast."
3,One of the best ANTI CLIMAX films of the decade.,I have almost rated the film 4 star especially towards the end ... very intense part BUT I was broken hearted when finally there appeared the cat.. the cat that changed the whole course of the movie and also downrated the film overall... VERY ANTI CLIMAX!
1,Save your time and money,This must have been a slow year for Washington to make a movie like this; a jumbled mess. Almost fell asleep.
1,Just awful,Always liked movies Denzel Washington was in - except this one. Would not recommend. That would be my review except six more words required.
3,"Spiritual, but not true","I was on the edge of my seat, my usual spot in ""possession"" films. Possessions do occur, but they cannot occur from merely touching someone else. Evil spirits can inhabit you, it's just that they can't be brushed onto you by passersby. If more filmmakers understood the themes that they find themselves producing/directing/writing, spiritual films would be more enjoyable. Fallen insults our intelligence, a story we know couldn't have happened. It's a good film, albeit a tad untrue."
2,"Tried, came close, failed","...A brilliant idea was left to rot.John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) is the capturer of a serial killer, Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, in the film's best role), who is sent to his death laughing and singing and promising that he'd be back. While some discrepancies between Reese and the evidence in the murders he committed nags at Hobbes, a riddle Reese asked him shortly before the execution turns up the suicide of a polieman thirty years ago and entangles Hobbes in the web that binds these two cases together with thousands of years of history and the supernatural.Yeah, it's a great premise. Too bad it's given such short shrift in here. Every aspect of this film was done better in Seven, despite the difference in their mechanations (the killer in Fallen really IS supernatural), and held up against its predecessor, Fallen leaves a whole lot to be desired."
1,Fallen Down,"How can a movie made in that hip city of Philadelphia not have at least a little something going for it? Here's how: Copycat killings lead the baffled Detective Hobbes (Denzel) to figure that something of the supernatural variety is hexing and vexing him. Despite hooking up with a theology prof (Embeth Davidtz), Hobbes has to figure it all out himself. Azazel-that's the demon-travels from one body to another by touch. How daffy! You're sure to get a chuckle out of the central transference scene as pasty-faced extras do their worst Boris Karloff acts."
1,Poor Release of Movie,I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time. It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning. The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my rating
5,Spooky,"This Denzel Washington film left me paranoid as i talked to my friend on the phone. Washington plays Hobbs, a New York Detective living with his brother. After witnessing the execution of a serial killer, Hobbs believes his troubles are over. More murders are taking place and he finds a woman named Greta who tells him of a fallen angel named Azaezel. It eventually gets him in trouble with his boss(Donald Sutherland) and kills his partner Jonesy(John Goodman) The final showdown leaves you breathless."
2,A CAT HAS ONLY 9 LIVES,"A sincere attempt at a Stephen King type film quickly turns into an Alan King type production. Only the acting skills of Denzel Washington and Donald Sutherland prevent this supposed thriller from becoming a 3 Stooges affair. Warned not to get involved in a closed murder case, Officer Denzel does just the opposite and mayhem ensues. A demon is unearthed who writes in ancient Aramaic, yet prefers listening to the ""Rolling Stones"" in English. This supernatural creature can occupy only one human at a time,but can jump from one person to another in a split second.As dead bodies start piling up,Denzel decides to become the sacrificial lamb, poisoning himself after seemingly all targets of demon occupation have eliminated one another. Frustrated, the demon finally wins out, occupying a stray cat. The flick ends with a loud rendition of ""Sympathy for the devil"". ""Nineteenth nervous brekdown"" would hav been better."
4,"Creepy, gripping, horror story, and very well filmed.","This is a new variant on a serial killer theme. As with a lot of recent movies you have to watch this one. A complex plot, a type of reality/fantasy story that keeps you glued to the story, thank God it's a DVD and I can flick back! Most of the movie is filmed during the hours of darkness, and I came away with an impession of gloom and doom. Don't misunderstand me, this is what was intended and it creats an appropriate mood. Very well acted, I have to single out Denzel Washington. He does a very good job with this story, and is an underated actor. The storyline about a supernatural killer makes for a compelling plot. Full of twists and turns and suprises, I was kept guessing up to the end. This DVD is well transferred, both sound and picture. See this one, I do not think you will be diappointed."
4,A definite weekend rental.,"There is not too much about this movie that isn't good. It starts out fast, maybe too fast. It dragged for a little while in the middle but ended real fast. My only complaint is that ending was too perdicitable. I wouldn't say buy this one unless you really like Denzel Washington. If you are stuck inside for the weekend I would say this is a great rental. Really worth seeing."
4,A very intriguing movie and an excellent twisted plot!,"What I like the most about this movie isn't necessarily the plot, which is to die for, but it is the idea and the unexploited side of this movie. This was the first film I was that was talking about transfer of the Devil in human beings. THat showed us a shadow part of the bible I never had heard of.Denzel Washington is great and acts very serious and interested. Great acting.A must see."
4,Engaging Suspense,"This is from the director of Seven, and it is really a director's film.The style of film-making is really about half of what the film has to offer. But, that is a lot. I think of this as the whodunnit film of the Occult .Denzel Washington is brilliant and the cast of supporting characters are fun and interesting. Fallen is a great film for the fan of suspense or Occult who can't stomach the usual fright fest. It is really as much a mystery as a thriller. If you are in the mood to be really entertained,but don't want to be up all night ,you'll enjoy what Fallen has to offer."
4,Great movie,I have watched many times and always enjoy. Yep a little on the dark side but still good. Denzel and John Goodman always good together.
2,"good actors, bad movie","I am a fan of Denzel Washington, and I think John Goodman is a very good actor, but this movie did not live up to the expectations. The main reason is that the plot just unravels even before halfway, it simply is not believable in any sense. And the final was a letdown and a vain attempt to be even creepier than the movie. I don't particularly have a problem with supernatural thrillers, but this one just doesn't make the cut. No matter how good the actors are and the acting is, when the material you work with is bad, there is not much you can do."
2,well..,"Well, the premise may be interesting but it doesnt hide the fact that the movie is just plain boring..it doesnt get off the ground and its really painful to watch."
4,"A clever demon movie, well-done","Fallen creates a fascinating situation out of what could have been nothing more than a gimmick. A demon returned to Earth is free to pass from body to body, unless the body should die while he is in it. But he can only pass through touch. This premise leads to a unique and effective cinematographic technique--the flight of the demon from his pursuers, and his current location is determined by a sweeping, racing camera chasing down crowded streets. This could get old, but what it brings out is that every body the demon inhabits is affected by him, taken over by him in a sense, but yet retains its own character. People remain themselves and the demon simultaneously, and we're forced to confront the mix of good and evil that can reside in even the most innocent, helpless looking individuals."
5,"If demons can jump from person to person, I wonder if God can...","Fantastic movie on such a difficult subject. I mean, I never believed in demons much before I saw this movie, but after seeing it, now I'm not so sure, especially after some things I've seen in real life that are eerily similar. But on the positive side, I suppose if a demon can jump from person to person at the touch of a hand, I'm confident the Almighty can do the same, if He so chooses."
5,spooky,"I love Denzel Washington, he is a great actor and brings character to every role he plays this movie is no exception. Cops with a spooky side stir the imagination................And, John Goodman really drives the word spooky home..............."
5,Finally a reissue of a hard-to-find classic!,"I loved this book as a child and kept it out of the library like kids today do Harry Potter. I am thrilled to find it reissued, as old copies are hard to come by (although I noticed Amazon now carries a few old copies reasonably priced). I will love seeing the old pictures again and sharing it with my kids."
4,Made an Excellent Gift,"I bought this for a friend who loves Finnish mythology; I heard nothing but praise about it. She notes that there's a common plot for many of the stories, but /most/ myths are like that, so it's not really a problem"
1,Way too greasy.,"I would give these no stars if I could. This stuff is literally like slathering oil onto your eyelids. The oil goes into my eyes and its difficult to wash off. I guess this is fine if you have stubborn waterproof mascara that you need to scrub off, but other than that, go for the oil-free ones. Stay away from these!"
1,wish-I-knew,"Yuk - I heard Almay's eye makeup removers were some of the best - But, Not this one! It was way too wet & greasy. I even had trouble getting that greasy feel off my hands. I had to throw them out and would never buy them again. (I tried to give no stars, but the review would not accept zero stars.)"
3,Brick,"This thing weighed a ton, but the features it had at the time it was purchased was nice. Though I think this thing was purchased 3or4 years ago so not much to say today. 10-13-2012"
5,Michel Thomas - Advanced,"Great service and product. I really enjoyed Michel Thomas' introduction to Spanish and hoped to get more CD's. Our local bookstore said they were unable to get the Advanced version, and suggested I look on the internet. Am I every glad I did! There is so much more to learn, and it's wonderful to hear him teaching to two more (mature) students. This is the first time I've ordered anything through the internet, but a friend assured us that Amazon was a realiable source. Thanks."
1,Unbelievably poor.,"This course is nowhere near as valuable as the first course. Michel Thomas sounds very unenthusiastic and the material is difficult to follow. It seems as though the course was put together in a slipshod manner in order to placate those of us who have been requesting a good follow-up to the original 8 disc course. Don't waste your money, and if you want to go the next step, open up your pocketbook and drop a good buck on all three Pimsleur comprehensive courses."
2,Not recommended.,Too easy for cat to get off.Have already lost it. This is the second one we have lost so won't recommend this to others.
1,"Lolly molds were good, but the Company was awful to deal with","After sending me 2 incorrect chocolate molds, and them failing to provide a customer service contact number, I had to report them to my credit card company. I received this mold long after my child's 4th birthday party, so it was useless after the fact, but we made chocolate pops at another time. It was a disappointing and frustrating experience with this company!"
3,More than one Boom Boom,There is a Pointblank/Charisma CD titled Boom Boom. Its tracklist differs from the K-Tel CD by the same name. Some of the other reviews refer to it instead of the K-Tel release based on the references to song titles. It includes 1.Boom Boom 2. I'm Bad Like Jesse James 3. Same Old Blues Again 4. Sugar Mama 5. Trick Bag (Shoppin' For My Tombstone) 6. Boogie at Russian Hill 7. Hittin' The Bottle Again 8. Bottle Up and Go 9. Thought I Heard 10. I Ain't Gonna Suffer No More. Don't be misled by those reviews into thinking the K-Tel release is better than it is.
2,Disappointing,"John Lee Hooker provided some early memorable historic cuts but this album does not include any. The Healer was a milestone in his revival, Mr Lucky less so and this followup album loses even more of that impact. The album has guests: Robert Cray, Albert Collins, Charlie Musselwhite and John Hammond among others. The only tracks which approach being memorable are 'Same old blues' and 'Boogie at Russian hill'. This album is not often played from my collection."
3,new orleans,"Not bad, These are some old school new orleans songs. thats the only reason from me not giving this a higher rating. Some of the songs very out dated and repetitive. the later half of the cd is better, Its more gangsta .Stand out tracks are #10,1,6,.Buy this cd to see what new orleans had to offer before they blew up the rap scene in the late 90's. If you like old shcool new oleans rap music this cd is defintely for you."
1,Terrible Quality,"This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie of all time, and unfortunately I was trying to save a few dollars by buying the cheaper one, big mistake! This thing will hardly play at all, very poor quality image. It is not worth the disk it's on. Now I have to get the remastered one anyway, sigh. Lesson learned."
2,What is this?,"Jackie is listed on the box, but is only in some random fight scenes in the first five monutes of this movie. Disapponting."
1,still waiting,placed this order in the first week of August and still waiting to get it in the second week of september
3,Chan's first flick that boost him to stardom,"This is a decent flick of Jackie Chan's early stuff. Jackie had a good share of unsuccessful films with Lo Wei, because he didn't use Jackie Chan to the fullest. Lo also tried to make Jackie Chan another Bruce Lee. But this is his Jackie's first collaboration with Yuen Woo Ping (the choreographer from The Matrix triology, Kill Bill Volumes 1 & 2, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and Unleased), and he introduced Jackie to the genre of kung-fu comedy.This DVD (the Columbian Tristar version) is the second-best version out there. This version, however, cuts out a brief fight between a cat and a snake (this fight scene is important to the plot). To get the full story, buy the Mei Ah version, or the Hong Kong version."
1,Wow - this really *is* a cheap bootleg - DO NOT BUY!!!,"NOTE - THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE BUT A WARNING THAT WHAT AMAZON IS SHIPPING IS AN INCREDIBLY CHEAP AND OBVIOUS BOOTLEG.Seriously. I figured the few people who had reported this were kooks, but they're not - this *is* a bootleg, and a terrible one at that. You can find better bootlegs on streetcorners in NY. The cover is obviously photocopied, and the disc itself is a DVD-R that comes conveniently pre-scratched. Worse than that, though, is the fact that this is *obviously* a rip of a VHS tape that was poorly transferred and completely uncropped. I'll be filing a complaint with Amazon."
5,Snake in the Eagle's Shadow,Jackie Chan who was in this movie very good with is Kung Fu Skills in the action seens.
4,Very Pleasant movie,"This was a good movie with some nice choreographed-classic 'Kung Fu' fight scenes, the dubbing was very interesting, the training scenes were great and the theme song to the movie was unique."
1,Jackie Chan is not in this movie - it's very deceiving!,jacky is only in the flashback scene but is not in this movie. Don't buy this movie - it's corny without Jacky.
1,Horrible Picture and Audio Quality! DO NOT BUY!,This DVD is probably a bootleg. The video quality is that of very old VHS and it only has the English dub as available audio. I deserve the money wasted that I spent on this piece of trash. The box art should have tipped me off.Fingers crossed for a better release of this classic movie.
2,bootleg,"bootleg, different soundtrack than original, bad copy. dvd box from obvious bootleg. dont buy this copy, not worth it. in my opinion, jackie chan's best movie. amazing martial arts"
4,"Bought 'em, wear 'em, like 'em","In looking for a pair of harness boots, the choice came down to Frye and Double H. Double H got the nod and I'm pleased with the results. I wear the boots mostly for riding (10-15K miles a year), with a little casual wear on the side, and they're great for that. The fit's good, the boots are comfortable, and they're holding up well. The one thing that kept me from giving these boots 5 stars is the heel design. It's just too big and clunky - Frye got the lines right there. But this is a personal taste thing; otherwise, I have no problem with recommending these boots."
2,stay away from this book if you enjoy math,Mattson has produced a horribly awkward text. The manner in which the book is written is far from engaging. The example problems are tediously uninteresting and explained without regard for the value of conceptual knowledge. Much of his terminology is obscure and he frequently makes vague references to previous parts of the text which can become impossible to follow. Very few of the problems have solutions; one is supposedly able to determine whether their answer is correct without any affirmation. The book redeems itself only by the many lists of real mathematics books which the author suggests as outside reading. Go read THESE books instead.
2,still missing an important two minute section,"There is a selection of dialogue between the french retired army officer and Oland's character that has disappeared. It is pivitol in that it explains that he is a disgraced army officer who only wears his uniform to hide his shame from his sister. while it is only two minutes or less of dialogue, it has been cut for some unknown reason out of prints in the last ten years. an old showing on PBS years ago had it uncut, but all the dvd releases both in the US and europe (I have a PAL copy from the UK) as well as all showings on TCM show the version with this piece missing"
3,Dietrich,OK film. I found it entertaining. Better than The Scarlet Empress. Not sure I would purchase again. Maybe wish to resell.
5,Is this ska?,"It doesn't matter, this is some of the best music I have ever heard. They are a great band with something to say. I can't compare them to anyone else. They put on the best live shows as well. This CD isn't as good as Progress because that one is a bit more diverse, but this is definately still great."
5,Excellent Genre-Defying Music,"These guys don't seem to want to pick a genre. They transition easily from song to song from genre to genre. One song could be straight up ska, another a frenzy of prog rock, another smooth reggae, and another all three at the same time! This is the defining aspect of the album, variance. And it works very well. There's plenty of substance with very little filler. Not to mention the guitarwork and horn playing are phenomenal."
2,What Hapend?,"Ok, face it Progress was a good album, it had promise I thought for the future of this band, but they steered another way and turned into a I wana be a punk band sound. When they first came onto the seen I found them by accident looking for something to fill my musical void since Bradley Nowel died. The hard thing is you can never replace Sublime, but progress had a somewhat similar sound to Sublime, and in some instances the vocals kind of reminded me allot of Sublime. I was hoping that this album would follow that sound they had and improve on it, but..... well in my opinion they might as well be Good Charlotte now, and god I hate that band! . Oh well, by the way to anyone else who was a big Sublime fan like me, you might want to check out Slightly Stooped Acoustic roots, and Dispatch. Two good bands."
1,save your money,loved halfway between here and there and progress. saw them live and became a fan. was very disapointed with this cd. save your monney or get their upcoming dvd.
1,a disapointment,I was so disapointed when I opened this cd I'd only give it any stars for the who woulda thought video on the dvd
4,Rx Bandits = One of the most talented and unique bands!,"This new CD is really incredible. Every single song has a point to it, and isn't about heartbreak or other lame emo topics. These songs are all so great. The best tracks are Mastering the List, Never Slept So Soundly, and Sell You Beautiful. All the other songs range from great to good, but not one song is bad. This is one truly talented and amazing band, and a great cd!"
1,Big Mistake!,"The product showed up FOUR days after it was supposed to have been delivered and of course missed Christmas by a mile, then the first two discs would not play and now we are dealing with the return process. I will never go through this again!"
1,Warner Blew This Big Time!,"Like the other couple of reviewers, I was also excited to hear Mama's Family was coming to DVD, but just minutes ago I found out in a Sitcoms Online review that the episodes are edited syndication cuts. I am so disappointed and feel so cheated. If I would have found out sooner I would have canceled my pre-order but it's now too late. Warner Bros. has some major explaining to do.The show is a definite five stars, but I wish I could give this DVD no stars. A big fat raspberry to you, Warner!"
1,CUT UP and BUTCHERED Episodes DON'T SELL,Warner Bros. needs to go back to the vaults on these. Who runs that division who does teh quality checks? Who said hmm just give them the syndicated cut episodes.. it was for a while the most requested of all TV shows to be released on DVD now it will probably be forgotten. Warner needs to get some people in there who care about the products they are selling and packaging.. furthermore they should've released SEASON 1 + 2 as one set instead of the small 13 episode first season. Now that I know these episodes are cut I WILL NOT buy this set. MAybe Warners can correct the error .. or even go one better give the full episosdes in a Season 1 + 2 Box set.Come ON WARNERS .. are you listening?JackDVD78@aol.com
1,Warner Used Edited Syndication Episodes Here...Why Bother?,"This box set uses the episodes that have been edited for more commercial time shown in syndication, NOT the original network versions that were at least 3 minutes longer for each episode. Warner Bros. claims that they don't own the rights to the original uncut versions. That being the case, why did they even bother to release this lackluster set? Why not let whoever DOES own the rights to the uncut episodes do it? I'll pass on this one and hope that it eventually gets done right!"
3,"Great Show, Mediocore DVD","For true Mama's Fans- this dvd is bitter sweet. It is finally here- Mama's Family. And it does have the episodes- but only as they are shown in syndication on TV.There is still no ""Girt Rides Again"". And all the extra features such as the promos for the show or even cast bios are not included. However- it is something and I wont rate it horribly, because it is like watching it on TV. But to call it the ""Complete"" first Season is a misnomer, and terribly misleading.The true Mama Fans want it all- in its entirety. Every joke, every scene, every episode!Still, I guess its better than nothing.Mama's Family is probably the most undderrated and underappreciated sit com in tv land history! And this dvd only adds insult to injury in that respect.But since television networks wont air this show forever, its something to have ""just in case""."
1,Thanks for the heads up; I won't have to waste money on edited re-runs!,"Thanks to the REAL fans here that saved me from wasting money on edited re-runs. I understand that some are glad to just get Mama's Family at all, but they need to understand they're only going to hurt us all in the end. If we stick to our guns and say, ""NO SALE ON EDITED RE-RUNS"", you'll discover how fast the Warner company can release the COMPLETE episodes. They've pulled this same act before with other television shows. Warner has done such a tremendous disservice to Mama's Family. No sale!"
2,incomplete episodes,"I am glad it had closed caption, but disappointed the dvd episodes were each missing about 3 minutes of episodes as network aired, and showed the syndication truncated versions."
1,not paying money for syndicated episodes,"When I first learned that Mama's Family was FINALLY going to be released on dvd, I was excited. I think the show was one of the funniest sitcoms of the eighties and certainly deserved to be on DVD. I was about to order my copy when much to my chagrin I learned that the syndicated episodes were on the dvd. That, along with the disappointing fact that there are no extras on this dvd is enough for me to keep my money in my pocket. I honestly don't understand why there are ratings here of anything higher than a 1 for this shabbily treated dvd set. Hopefully Warner Bro or Lorimar or whoever else in charge will listen to the public and give Mama's Family the royal treatment it deserves. Please don't waste your money on what you can just watch on tv. :-("
5,Just What I Expected!!!!,"This the very first review of many, many products that I have purchased on Amazon. I felt like this was my best opportunity to do so with all the bashing this dvd set has recieved as of late, especially since I am a huge fan of Mama's family. I guess people expect alot more out of their dvd's than I do. I purchase dvds strictly for the movies/tv shows that are on them. Out of the near 100 I own, I may have watched the bonus features on 2. Mama's Family delivers exactly what I expected, Mama's Family. I don't know anything about introductory segments of Harvey Korman or anything of the like. This dvd set is just like watching them on tv, exactly what I wanted and expected. So if you're looking for bonus features and all that, you will be dissapointed. If you are like me and just wanting Mama's Family as seen on tv, you will be very happy."
1,Very disappointed with the season 1 DVD,"As much as I love ""Mama's Family"", I was very disappointed with the DVD of season 1. First of all, there are no extras on the dvd, no original opening, and most importantly no complete episodes. All of these episodes are exactly as they are shown on tv, with a few minutes cut out of each. I find it very deceiving, the front of the case says complete first season. How can they call it the complete first season if they are the episodes that have been cut down for syndication? I hope that if they do come out with a set of the second season, they will include full episodes and some bonus material, otherwise there is no way I would buy it. If I want to watch the exact same episodes that are shown everyday on tv, I will just watch them. To me, it served little purpose to buy the dvd."
5,YEAHH!!,"Will buy it and all of the releases! It was a very unique show on television. I liked the no-nonsense about it. I could understand this family. And GREAT acting, too. I read that in the beginning the higher ups wanted to use exstensive old age makeup on Vicki and she argued, basically, ""Hey, simple is what worked before, that's part of the character."" (Vicki's Biography book). And with just a wig, padded dress, glasses, and that MAMA look, she transformed into a Grandma. One you wouldn't sass to for very long. Can't wait to buy it!"
5,Great Value,Gret value for the money. Fast service too. what ever what ever what ever what ever what ever what ever
5,"""Well I bet the neighbors are just loving this""","Who could every forget that. This DVD is a ""site for sore eyes"". Just some of the quotes I just love from Mama's Family I am very pleased with this DVD. They just don't make shows like this anymore. Good ol' fashion comedy. Even though I have EVERY episode of Mama's Family on VHS tape I want to get the DVD collection. I started taping these shows back in the late 80s and still watch them everyday. Right now I have about 10 VHS tapes full of the shows. The commercials made me accumulate so many tapes. Its liking going back in time I can watch Mama's Family and also see the commercials that aired in the time and enjoy the Harper Family and have a big laugh. This DVD is a must to all Mama fans."
4,good comedy,My grandaughter likes this show and so do I. We thinkit is funny and reminds me of the days when there was goodclean laughter on TV
2,irritating,"Nothing against the seller, the dvds play well, good delivery. The programs themselves are horrible. 90 percent of each show has the lead lady complaining with negative attitude about everything/anything that is the situation; and yelling it loudly. She seems to have a peg up her a. Laughter machine in background does no good for the shows. Just my opinion, so ended up putting it away."
4,"If you are a fan of the show, then you will love it!!","I gave a 4 star because of the poor quality of the editing. It's just like watchingthe television show with all the commercials. Bummer, however I'm a fan of the showso... I'll live with it."
2,I cancelled my order,"Reluctantly I cancelled my order for the first season of Mama's Family. After years of waiting for it on DVD, it's so disheartening to hear that Warner is treating the show and its fans and customers so shabbily by offering edited versions of the episodes. Where is the quality control? It's unforgivable the way they're dumping it in this truncated form onto the market. I simply won't waste money on it, especially when I already have these versions on Tivo. As far as I know Warner hasn't responded to the many complaints, which shows how little they care about their own product."
4,a charming story,"I sometimes think when I look at reviews on this website if any one has read some of the obscure books I have read and voila! someone else has read Toots in Solitude. It is an overlooked book. I found it extremely enjoyable. It is well written, well organized and moves right along. And it comes to an inevitable conclusion. Very fine, indeed."
1,I AGREE! LACES WAY TOO SHORT!!,"I've had the most frustrating time trying to return these gloves! I'm not happy as many here agree, that the laces don't allow for the girth of the arm and wrist area. Also, the company All American something orders from other companies because I've been dealing with the manufacturer directly. The manufacturer LoverSource will ONLY refund the buyer. They don't have the ability to credit an account for Me to hold for later purchase or credit My Amazon.com account. Now I'll need to see if this LoveSource even has a website to see if I can exchange these gloves. If I can't exchange, I'm stuck losing My gift, refunding the buyer who ordered the gloves from My Wishlist. There doesn't seem to be any guarantee for the Amazon member to keep credit when any product ordered from an Amazon wish list."
3,Beware the loss of blood flow,"I got these for a Rocky Horror outfit. They definitely ""look"" sexy... but at a price. First, beware how tight they are when lacing them up. They may not feel tight at first, but when you're arms go numb, you'll regret making them so form-fitting. Then again, you almost HAVE to lace them up tight because there isn't much string to work with. Second, you will probably need help tying them off at the top once you're through lacing them up. Third, they get sweaty... which goes against the Sexy Factor. Finally, you may need help peeling them off at the end of their use.Overall, they do what they are designed to do... aka Look sexy. They don't Feel very sexy though."
2,does not match picture,"This is not the product in the picture. The picture is a fingerless glove. The product is a fingered glove.I accidentally got 2 (thinking I'd clicked on the wrong thing the first time) and was rather frustrated.What they are is fine, it's just not what's in the picture."
2,Laces way too short,"Unless you have sticks for arms, the strings are too short, and a bit thick. Shoelaces might be better for these gloves. They do look good, if you get long enough laces though. They are shiny black, thin material, kinda cheap, but you get what you pay for. I used them for a halloween costume."
5,Miss Them,Markus and Nadia has got to be one of the best duos ever. I just love everything about this song and the remixes are teriffic. I just wish they would of stayed together to make and give us more jewels.
4,On Eagle's Wing,"If you love music and dance mixed with history than this is for you. Filmed live with a huge cast of professional dances from several different styles, it is the story of the journey of the Scots-Irish from Scotland to Ireland and eventually to America. Even though it is about one nationality of people the message and story of the immigration of the Scots-Irish can be seen reflected in the stories of all people who immigrated to America.Featuring the powerful voice of Scots-Irish singer Peter Corry and the beautiful Scottish singer, Alyth, you learn of the hardships, difficulties and joys of a people who had such powerful impact on American history but have been largely unknown."
5,Captured white boy finds home with native tribe,"This is an excellent story of the capture and life of a little boy in the Amazon jungle. The tribe that takes him raises him as their own. While fighting other tribes and resisting the encroachment of civilization, he tries to find his real father. Based on a true story, this is an action packed, fast moving, heartwarming, excellent film. Brief, native nudity. Not for children."
3,an interesting movie,"i really like this movie for it's visual style. the colors of the forest are bold, as are all the people's faces, and there is an intensity to all that color. the story is supposed to be based on a true story, which adds to the drama of seeing it unfold..you can't help wonder what you would do. i saw this movie at around 12 yrs old, and i loved it because it was so unusual, and because you really care about all the people involved in the story....it grabs you and you want to know what happens to the end. i highly reccomend it to anyone, although no boys under 17-18 should see it because it has a million beautiful, bare breasted tribeswomen in it!! haha."
5,We truly need a Blu Ray of this fine film,"This is a truly great film on many levels- most of which have already been explored on prior reviews--My main reason to add to the list is to encourage others to add their voices to requesting a Blu Ray of this fine film-- it is remarkably beautiful; To another end and amplifying on a prior comment, more information on the true Invisibles of the Rain Forest would most certainly be appreciated !"
