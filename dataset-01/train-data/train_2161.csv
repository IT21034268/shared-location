1,never saw it coming,"are you people serious? did you expect george lucas to do anything but exactly this. he is gonna try to exploit the most die-hard fans like he's done for years. he's a greedy egomaniac. eventually he'll release the original theatrical version, when sales of this turd bottoms out."
2,The New Stuff Stands Out!,"I used to be a fan of George Lucas - that is until he started messing around with computer graphics and forgot just what it was that made his films so charming - the people.After seeing the Phantom Menace, I just had to accept that we have lost a major film maker. Then when he started messing with the original series from 1977 - I just couldn't believe it. Yes a director should have the final say on their work, but.....I have lost interest. What made Star Wars special to me was the humanity of it - it had an almost mythological significance to our culture - it wasn't something we went to see simply for the special effects - it was deeper than that. Unfortunately, George Lucas has lost sight of what made his films special - and he is trying to 'improve them'. Sorry George it just does not blend together and it is like seeing a fake copy of an original painting - please restore it the way it was before- it was so much better!"
5,How Can You Say Star Wars is Bad?,"This may have the special edition scenes in it, but it's worth buying! When will you ever see another trilogy like this! Widescreen! So many Special Features! Great Picture! The Best Special Effects ever createdt next to Lord of the Rings, Independence Day, and Jurrasic Park! I AM YOUR FATHER! I ORDER YOU TO BUY THIS DVD COLLECTION!"
2,Easier to sit through than most disney films,This children's movie is slightly easier for a parent to endure than a lot of disney movies. It boggles the mind how many people over the age of twelve are devoted to it. Probably the same people who still collect children's toys and spend their breakfasts trying to solve the maze on the back of a box of Captain Crunch.
4,Return of the Child Dreamer,"Like a lot of people, this trilogy revisits my childhood. I didn't think I would get this excited about this trilogy, but I rank this release on a level of Lord of the Rings DVD's. Is there some eleven year old who sat in a multiplex and got as passionate over LOTR as I did in 1977? I hope so. I bought the bubble gum cards, models, Marvel comics, and action figures.The best digital remastering was Empire Strikes Back. I loved the movie when it came out, but even back then I thought the film quality could have been better. The sound quality is great and the documentary is required viewing for any SW fan. Carrrie Fischer talking about Jabba, the slavegirl outfit, and Lucas wanting her to lose ten pounds before the start of A New Hope is great."
1,Warning. Bootleg editions.,This seems to be a bootleg edition of the movies. Someone seemed to have made a new movie & spliced in scenes from the original trilogy. Whoever did this should be arrested for making such bad movies & then trying to sell them under the Star Wars name. Avoid these at all costs.
1,unfortunate,"I am very disappointed to hear all of the negativity around the blue ray edition of star wars, I grew up on these movies and have always loved them. Unfortunately they are not the same movies that we grew up with as long as you are over the age of 20. I had this pre-ordered but after all the negative hype had cancled my order and will wait for the price to drop down to the bargin bin. As a fan we want to see the original film release on Blue ray Mr. Lucas"
2,"nice and clear, but even more crap..","Sure, it looks fantastic on DVD, but that's about as far as it goes. The biggest disappointment was that I actually thought I was buying the ""Star Wars"" Trilogy. Silly Me...Instead I end up buying ""CGI for the sake of having CGI"" and irrelevant and irritating changes that only serve for continuity with over-hyped inferior byproduct revenue-raising films.I'm sorry, but they didn't even use Hayden Christensen in the end of ""Jedi"", they used some guy that had a vague resemblance to him instead. Pathetic really...George, get your head out that place that the sun don't shine, and give the fans what they actually want, cleaned up ORIGINAL Star Wars."
2,I Won't Buy Any of the 'Special Editions',"The only way I'll buy the Star Wars DVD trilogy is in wide screen with the original release. I hated his updates and didn'teven bother to see the re-release of Jedi, even though it was killer to see it on the big screen as an adult.I'll just keep my VHS trilogy which is in the original release.And don't get me started on how bad both prequels have been...."
2,Logically Both Additions Should Be Released,"Logically Both Additions Should Be ReleasedWhat’s the loss in releasing both additions I ask? I personally would prefer the originals along with the 58,000 odd people who have joined in the petition at the Originaltrilogy website. Any sane businessperson would see 50 thousand anxious customers willing to purchase a $70 trilogy DVD set a worthy investment. As it seems though using simple logic (whether that concerns Business, Casting, Scripting, or Acting) has long since deserted the Star Wars franchise. Sadly the greatness of the original stories of Long Ago, in a Galaxy Far Far Away will forever remain a memory to the imaginative few (58,437 and counting)…~`Andrew: Star Wars fan since age 6’~"
1,Do not buy,"Give it up Lucas. I'm starting to think you were lucky that FX technology was as primitive as it was when you made the original movies, because working with those limitations probably made the originals better than the your mental canvas allowed. At least Spielberg has the humility to realize that the limited appearances of the shark in Jaws, due to problems with the mechanical model, led to a better movie."
3,good but not great,"too many ""new"" improvements. but after episode 3 comes out, george lucas will release the original trilogy without the extra effects added on. i guarantee it!!!! i really disliked the stupid bar band in return of the jedi. it was only 20 seconds but really out of place and looked very tacky compared with the rest of the scene.george lucas has lost his edge. and he does not even know it. episode 3 will be as bad as episode 1 and 2. i have the original full screen on vhs and the new dvds but i would rather watch the originals on vhs.i will just end up selling the dvds on ebay after the originals come out on dvds. anyways, this dvd set is ok but i wouldn't recommend it strongly unless you're really desperate.."
3,Star Wars,"I would just like to add to all the other ""reviews"" that I would also have liked to have seen the Original Trilogy released on DVD in it's original form and they will be one day, trust me, but for the moment this is what we are getting.I will be buying this set because I am a fan and can't wait to see these films again even though I have the originals on VHS and the Special Editions but my kids love these films so and they love Episodes 1 and 2. I was 8 years old when Star Wars was released in 1977 and would just like to say that I was in awe when I first saw it back then, seeing that Blockade Runner appearing then a massive StarDestoyer behind it was just amazing to me as it was to everyone else. If you do not want to buy this DVD then don't nobody is twisting your arms behind your backs forcing you to, I will be buying this DVD and when the Original version is released I will buy that too."
1,Prequel tie-in changes were completely unnecessary,"Why isn't the 1997 Special Edition on DVD?! Wasn't it supposed to be ""George Lucas' definitive vision""?! Now he has YET ANOTHER vision of the Original Trilogy?! Why didn't he make the prequels fit the Original Trilogy, instead of butchering the originals?! Weren't we told that he was releasing the first versions of Episodes IV, V and VI back in 1995 ""one last time""?! But no, now he's releasing the versions he said would never again see the light of day, and what he said was the finished product is not available on DVD. I guess the word ""logic"" is not part of Lucas' vocabulary..."
5,WTF??? Hayden Christensen in the original trilogy???,"Bad enough we have to see the 'special edition' versions, but additional changes like putting Hayden Christensen in at the end of Return is just plain wrong.Purists will also object to seeing the Ian McDiarmid emperor replacement in Empire."
5,The best films of all time finally on DVD!,"There's just no comparison. The Star Wars films set the standard, and everything else continues to just follow in their wake."
1,"This is NOT the ""Original Trilogy""","I can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Martin Scorsese has said, and I paraphrase, why bother obsessing over what I could have done differently? Just go on to the next thing. Or Huxley: if I changed a single word of Brave New World, it would be a different Brave New World. 20 years later, we are not the same people that made that work. Steven Spielberg had the govt bad guys in ET brandishing guns because he wanted it at the time. What would the great works we know be like if their authors had years later gone back to change them? The Godfather would not be what it is. The ""Director's Cut"" of Amadeus is not the same story. Etc. I will absolutely not be buying these. This is NOT the Star Wars Trilogy. ...Message to Mr. Lucas: I will DOWNLOAD a rip of the old Laser Disc editions. For FREE."
1,Lucas sucks,"George Lucas is an A**HOLE he knows what we want and refuses to give us a blu-ray quality of the actual original production with surround sound. Yet several times he's acted like he was giving us what we wanted then you get it and you find it has crappy video and audio, or like this version where he calls it original when it's the remake."
1,Originals? Really? I don't think so.,"These are not the ""originals"" as the packaging claims. Very misleading. Why would they present this as something it is clearly not?"
1,Han shot first,"Until you release the original films in their original state without all the added CGI foolishness, my money will stay in my pocket.Don't think I am serious? The last version I bought of the original trilogy was on laser disc.And the less said about the prequel trilogy, the better."
1,WARNING! READ BEFORE YOU BUY!,I got so excited when I saw this on the new release shelf at my local target. It clearly states on the back of the box that it contains all 3 CLASSIC movies. I have been waiting for the original theatrical versions of the films to be released on DVD for years now and was furious when I sat down to watch the original star wars and Greedo shot first! Nowhere on the box did it say anything about these being the special edition releases. I already have the special edition with the bonus disc and now I am stuck with an open box of the same movies.
1,Special Edition Stinks,"There is no way I'm going to purchase this bogus DVD set containing the ""special edition"" movies. I have my VHS tapes of the original, TRUE versions backed up several times, so I'll enjoy those until Lucas comes to his senses and releases those as well. That egotystical cow could have easily put both on this DVD set. He's not getting my cash for this insult."
2,Give us the option to watch the ORIGINAL versions!!!,"The one time I watched the new version of Star Wars I finally didn't mind the $60 I paid for each of the originals on laserdisc (THX widescreen!).Looks like it's time to drag out the old LD's and crank out some dvd's for me & my friends ;)If G.L. would package the old & new versions together, I wouldn't hesitate to spend my money, but until then he can kiss my ass!"
1,Star Wars is dead,"First the ludicrous special editions, then the atrocious prequels... And now Georgie boy doesn't even let us watch the original movies. I hope he dies sometime soon too, before he destroys Star Wars any further. I won't be buying this farce. I feel stupid enough for throwing away my money buying the Episode II dvd as it is.So sad..."
1,These are not the films you are looking for.,Don't buy it people! Don't give in!These are not the films you are looking for. These are not the films you are looking for. These are not the films you are looking for.
3,Totally over rated.,"Ok first of all, these movies are cool. Classic to say the least, but to go as far as saying the best movies ever made...LMFAO I feel sorry for you. I have 433 dvds and I can pick out at least 200 that are much better then star wars. I just bought the trilogy to add to my ever so growing collection. I was very displeased with the cheap packaging. The art is horrible and cheaply put together. The artwork in the cases was done pretty bad, un even spines that dont even line up perfectly, logos titles etc. If it were not for my creativity in creating custom cases it would be even more disapointing. They obviously rushed this release a little bit too fast...rant rant rant.."
3,Good saturday matinee fun!,"This is a pretty good Saturday Matinee ""creature feature."" You'll find all of the usual stuff: guys in rubber masks, puppets, claymation, horrible dialogue poorly acted... If it were food, it would be Hostess Cupcakes. Appealing to the least refined aspect of one's apetites. And that's OK! I like Hostes Cupcakes. Not every movie can be intellectually stimulating, nor should they all be. Mindless diversion is fun. This Buck-Rogers-Based space movie is full of ray guns, space battles, magic powers, and the usual assortment of elves, faries, nymphs, robots, and other dungeons-and-dragons stuff. It's like a video game come to life. Fun!"
1,Disappointed with my treatment,I ordered this trilogy on 12/01/07. The product was not shipped until 12/19/2007 and didn't arrive until 12/24/2007. Barely enough time to wrap the Christmas gift. I tried to contact the sender before 12/24 and got no response. Still haven't gotten any response. Customer service apparently does not exist here. I would not recommend them.
1,Goodbye Forever!,"I was excited to see the original (and best) Star Wars films make it to Blu-Ray. I made a pre-order. I thought about how awesome ""Empire"" would look in 1080p.Then I saw the clip of Darth Vader saying, ""Nooooooooo!"" like a drama mama, new for this release of The Return of the Jedi. A great scene totally ruined because George Lucas can't leave even anything alone. You wouldn't catch Peter Jackson doing this.I've canceled my order. With apologies to Amazon, I can't buy movies that have been ruined by the filmmaker."
1,Restore the Originals,"Your new versions are crap, sir. Please consider the majority of us who want the originals simply restored. No enhancements needed. We want the movies we loved and grew up with. I will not buy this and hope no one else does either. Thanks."
5,One of the Best...Ever,"The Star Wars Trilogy is still one of the best trilogies ever made. Three of the best movies ever produced. Wonderful and took the world by storm in the late seventies. A cultural icon that propelled George Lucas into stardom.The magic is still here 30 years later. I don't care if you don't like them or not, you owe it to yourself to watch these movies. I did and I loved them.Each movie features a commentary track with a number of people. The Bonus Disc features a few documentaries and featurettes I suggest that all fans should view.Highly recommended."
1,I must have a bad memory,"The cgi additions are just aweful. You go from cgi out the wazoo outside the cantina scene to the hokey costumes in the cantina - this really shows the 25+ years gap in technology and to add it just diminishes the validity of the movie's content. Just imagine if the matrix, lord of the rings, terminator (pick your favorite sci-fi movie) had their movies modified based on technology 25+ years from now. It may seem trivial to some but the reality is is that adding cgi to a film made in the 70's is just campy and degrades the visual experience.As most have already stressed, just give us the original and the modified versions. Is Lucas really this disgusted with the gaps between the 2 trilogies ? I do not think the changes made really impact the gap between the 2 series.Just beware - Lucas adds cgi whereever possible throughout these films."
1,We are not whining!!!,"It annoys me that those of us who have decided not to buy this DVD set are being called whiners by some other reviewers. I believe it isn't right to ask people to shell out $41.99 or more for movies that are not the ones we grew up with. It might just be a few tweaks here and there, but to me that is not the same movie. I refused to buy the special editions on VHS and I refuse to buy this set now."
1,Changes....WHY?,"While young viewers won't know the difference, George Lucas' changes to these films, especially Jedi are pathetic.He turned the musical sequence in Jaba's palace a modern-ish hip hopish music video and the worst of all is in the end, they show multiple celebrations on various planets. I don't need explain how bad this sucks.This is just the tip of the iceberg."
3,Dissapointed in this digital video release.,"I won't lie, the video quality is great, the audio quality is great. But I'm extremely dissapointed in this dvd release. It /is not/ the original three Star Wars films. It is the 1997 special edition 20th anniversary re-release of the films with added scenes, more special affects and tweaked scenes. I'm just letting everyone who is interested in purchasing this know. I bought it without knowing this and am thouroughly dissapointed with the release. I'll probably end up watching the films on vhs now, but I don't know yet."
1,"Noooooooo, thanks.","""Nooooooooo!"" Wow. There was nothing wrong with the original ending. It was dramatic and well done. Sure, making Vadar scream ""Noooooo"" ties it into Ep 3. This change defiles a previously powerful scene. I won't even begin to try to guess why it was changed. Other reviews have already described the imperfections retained in this release. Noooooooo, thanks. I'll pass."
1,"original star wars trilogy= 5 stars, this version= 1 star","the best thing i can say about this version (the special-special-edition) is that george lucas can't come to my house and erase (or change into special-edition-cr%p) the original trilogy set i have on vhs. otherwise since 1997, star wars has been in trouble. one day george lucas will die and some kid of his (not happy with just the 345345 billion dollars his dad left him from running star wars into the ground) will release the original trilogy on dvd...and the circle truly will be complete!!!! the only things worse than the special and special-special edition: episodes 1 and 2.the real star wars: RIP"
4,Conflicted,"I'm really not sure I want to purchase these DVDs. Everyone needs to own them if they've ever liked the series, of course. The movies are instant classics for adults and children alike. But I'm just not convinced I want to buy these, as they are not the pure, original theatrical versions. Instead, they are the blashemed ""Special Edition"" versions released a few years ago on VHS. The Special Editions changed a lot of fundamentals of the trilogy. The worst crime is changing the famous showdown in the bar between the rugged Han Solo and Greedo the bounty hunter; Lucas felt it made Solo too much of a bad guy to have him shoot Greedo first, so a badly re-edited version was put in the Special Edition where Greedo shoots first. Not only does it look horrible, it changes the essence of one of the best characters. This is where my conflict brews: should I purchase this edition or boycott it until Lucas puts the original, classic versions out on DVD?"
3,The Destruction of a Treasure,"Greedo shooting first? What the [heck] is that all about? It had to be one of two things. Lucas thought that Solo's character wasn't noble enough and shooting Greedo unexpectedly just wasn't nice so he had him defending himself. If this is the case then it is a total rewrite and rape. The guy is a smuggler come on! The only other reason would be that the original script called for it and with this new edition he wanted give everyone a look at the way it was supposed to be. If you want to digitally remaster it great, but don't rewrite history you turkey. I don't care if he directed it...I had to give this version three stars. The orginal deserves ten of course."
1,Everything you'd ever want...except original versions,"A great trilogy, with a plethora (do you know know what is a plethora? Why would you use a word you do not know ze meaning of?) of extra tidbits, including color commentary from Lucas and Carrie. BUT NO OPTION TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL. Lucas is such a control freak he won't give US the option of watching the original OR his bastardized updates? Isn't that the beauty of DVD formats? The room to let the viewer decide? Save your money on this one, or I can guarantee Jar-Jar gets an extra 42 minutes screen time in the version 2.3 edition of Episode I--don't say I didn't warn ya."
1,"I want my ""wap wap"" ewok song !!!","I want Han to shoot fist !I don't want to see the wampa's reaction when he gets his arm chopped off !I don't want to see stupid CGI robots stepping on each others toes or whatever the hell is supposed to pass for comedy in Mos Eisley !I don't want to see the GCI Falcon looking like a jerky cartoon when it's landing on Bespin !And for the love of god, I want to see Sy Snootles in the flesh(not in cartoon !)singing her original classic songI could go on and on...Yeah, we may be geeks for caring so much. That hard headed bastard doesn't care half as much as we do for his own legacy.Until then, I'm going on ebay trying to find the original trilogy digitaly remastered."
4,starwar dvd's,"timely receipt. Well packaged, Dvd's all work, no skipping. Box was a little rough, but for the price I'm satisfied. Little boy loves them."
5,Star Wars Trilogy,"What would you expect, it's the original three Star Wars movies! These three are the best of the series of six! I purchased them used and they are in great shape. No scratches on any of the four DVD's (Bonus disk included)."
5,The Trilogy Rocks,Dude this is the one to get. the new scenes are out of this world. mr george did a super job adding the scenes with noone gonna be able to tell they are new. except for the fact he points out what he added at the beginning of the movies which i guess is ok. any way he changes around the city where they have the famous bar scene. and he changed the dinosaus that those guys in the white costumes wear. lets see what else did he change. oh yeah he has mr jabba walkin in this one its pretty cool. and there are new scenes for the little wookies when they celebrate beating he evil empire. i cant wait to see episode one but i dont get it why its called episode 1 when its the 4th movie of star wars. does anyone else wonder why this episode one movie didnt just come out in 1979. I think sir george thought up this stuff later just so he could make some more bucks. oh well im sure we are all gonna love the next couple movies. but i cant see them gettin better than these trilogy.
5,grow up and stop whining.,"These are 3 of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made, period. Lucas has every right to jazz them up a bit, I for one was ecstatic with the changes, they made these already great films even better. The X-wing-tie fighter battles are so much better now without the dodgy effects. The wampa is that much scarier, the sound is so much better.You people who whinge need to get over it, just forget about star wars if it causes you so much pain, life is too short to have hatred towards a guy you don't even know, these are just movie's and not worth spoiling your life over."
3,Lucas should be ashamed,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the Star Wars Trilogy as well as a fan of George Lucas. The Trilogy and American Graffiti are among my favorite films of all time. However Lucas's decision to only release the special editions of these films borders on a crime in my mind.The original release of these films marked a revolution is special effects. The motion control techniques and modeling were state-of-the-art at the times these films were released. All of hard work an innovation of teams of visionary artists will now be lost to history because of the ego and short sided thinking of one ego maniac.Why don't we just colorize every black and white film ever made because the directors really wanted color, but it just wasn't possible at the time? How about ""updating"" Gone With The Wind and making a really spectacular CG burning of Atlanta because that is what would have done if the technology had been available?(...)"
5,Give Lucas a Break,"Here you have it, what you so called ""fans"" have been whining about all these years. You have an unmolested version of one of the greatest movie trilogies ever released, and the redux version with all accompanying effects. These are all in one package for $50... $37 if you get it from Amazon. Heck, not 10 minutes ago, I almost ordered Episode IV and V in this format for $40. Now, I'll get the whole set for less!Here's the skinny. If you aren't getting the product you want then no one is forcing you to buy it. You're also doing a disservice to the Amazon review process by basing your review on some fantasy product that, as of now, doesn't exist. The fact of the matter is this.I am a huge fan of this trilogy, and this is the set I have been waiting for. I did what all of you should have done. I waited until it was available."
3,NEW GENERATION-SHUT UP!,"These movies are classics because they were made on a shoestring budget and because the technology was top notch back then. The added special effects were not bad, but they were not really needed. Rumor has it, George Lucas want to add the ghost of Hayden Christiansen (young Vader) anlong side the ghost of Yoda in Return of the Jedi, and in my opinion that is going way to far. If George Lucas really wants to make some money he should release the original untouched versions on DVD also.If the Hayden rumor is true, Lucas needs to be institutionalized so he keeps his damn hands off of these classic movies."
1,Star Wars has become a farce..,"The special editions with the new digital effects were really pathetic. The least George Lucas could do is release both versions (director's editions and the original theatrical cuts) in the same boxed set. Spielberg did this with E.T., so what is George's excuse?"
1,Noooooo,"Cancelled my preorder, adding Vader saying Nooooo as he throws the emperor in to the reactor was too much for me. Why ruin a perfectly great moment using the same Nooo! That so many people made fun of in episode 3? Oh well, saved me $40 today."
3,"It's not out yet, but I must comment","If David Horiuchi, the Amazon reviewer, really means it when he says ""who cares if Greedo shot first?"" then I think his bosses would be wise to reassign him to reviewing exercise videos and pilates tapes. The ""new scenes and special effects"" severely damaged the trilogy. I don't know, I care about the fact that little edit effectively blew the entire character arc of Han Solo...Has anyone done more to tarnish their own legacy than George Lucas has?"
3,What happened Lucas? You used to be beautiful.,"This COULD have been incredible. Lucas has apparently surrounded himself by people that will not tell him when he is on the wrong track. How unbelievable, in the age of the DVD, to not give us even the option, of watching the original release of the movies. It is clear, with the release of Episodes I & II, that Lucas only cares about the money and no longer about the fan base that made him one of the richest people in Hollywood. At this point, I wouldn't put it past him if he released some kind of ""Collector's Original Edition"" to coincide with the release of Star Wars Episode III, as a vehicle to make yet even more money. Thank goodness I have access to the movies in their original format on LaserDisc."
1,No Sale,"I'm not falling for this again. Lucasfilm got my money twice in 2004/2006 and we still don't have a decent transfer of the unaltered original trilogy. This set uses the SAME transfer as the 2004 DVDs, complete with crushed black levels and messed up colours, not to mention more idiotic changes. Change whatever you like Lucasfilm, but until you give the fans what we want you won't see another cent of my money. I really hope you take a bath on this."
1,Never,"Let me make this simple. I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER buy a Blu-ray Star Wars set until it includes the unaltered theatrical versions of the original trilogy. If someone buys this garbage for me as gift, I will return it."
3,Nice Sharp Images BUT WAY TO DARK!,"I am surprised that no one else is noticing how dark ROTJ looks. ANH looks great, Empire looks good except for a few shots, but ROTJ is very dark and I find it very distracting. The dessert scenes just aren't sunny and vibrant. The endor scenes look even worse. I try to adjust my TV but it just doesn't help. I love this set but I feel that they rushed them a bit. I hope this gets addressed in the future. I would have waited another year to make sure that I got this set right. Now I guess that I am stuck with it this way."
3,Star Wars galore.,"Star Wars triology were such popular films and still are. Sometimes I can't understand why these sci-fi adventures are such classics but I do enjoy The Empire Strikes Back - the other two I could live without. Harrison Ford became a huge star, too bad Mark Hamill got lost in the shuffle. Star Wars is cool but I've seen better."
3,charming!,"I liked this movie much better than most of the others my kids choose to rent. Don't get me wrong, I don't think I could have sat through these in the theater, but I looked up from the newspaper several times (mostly at my kids' urging!) to watch the movies. To parents, I recommend steering your kids toward this DVD next time its their turn to choose the movie. While not truly enjoyable for adults, it certainly is less tedious than some others, especially those cartoons with all the annoying songs."
5,May the Force be with you!,Every Star Wars fan desires to have some memorabilia that will help remind them of the good ole days. What better piece than the movies themselves (with added bonuses). Here are the shows that started us all on a voyage through good and evil whether we will give in to the Dark Side or triumph as great Jedi Knights. One to own!
1,who agrees with me,ok i could get past some of add in stuff but what the hell was that new scene in jedi? the whole new song and dance thing in jabas palace. that was retarded (...).ive changed my mind all the add in stuff is retarded (...).i dont know he did it but he actually ruined my favorite movie by adding a few things here and there.
1,I will not buy this.,"As the title says.I don't want a MTV generation bling bling Babylon 5 cheap 3D movie a la ""the new SW movies I & II"".My heart is broken because of this. This almost feels like the day I realised that i'll never go to the moon.40% off already? Is it because noone is buying this piece of..."
1,NO BUY : Waiting for the REAL original trilogy,"Yep, just adding a voice to all the others crying out for the unaltered versions.Oh, and I bet the extra's won't be able to match some of the documentaries some fanboys placed on YouTube."
2,Why the changes?!?!?!?!?,"I am still surprised that Geroge Lucas changed so many things in the film! And most notably, the ending of Return of the Jedi. I couldn't belive it! Instead of the having the original actor, they replaced him with Hayden Christean ( sp? )! I don't have anything against him, but come on! He probably didn't even know what star wars was when return of the jedi came out. So, instead of this, please stick with the VHS verison which haven't been messed with. Even though the picture quality on the film is GREAT actually. The VHS is much more better simply because you can get to see the original trioglys without anything being changed."
3,"Yeah, Well...","...I still wish you could get these films restored as seen in 1977 (and so.) I don't mind the re-makes so much, but I miss the originals and my VHS tapes are wearing out."
1,Just the annual re-pack again,"Pros: The box is attractive.Cons: You probably already own these several times over.To those defenders and 5-star reviewers, bear in mind this is a product review, not a film review. I'd be first in line for the Blu-ray or even and remastered (non-SE) DVD editions."
2,Lucas won't get my money,"Hayden Christiansen (however his name is spelled) as old Anakin???? Greedo shot first???? JAR JAR Binks????? Lucas did it again!!!!!! The idiot damaged the saga with the horrible Phantom Menace and the mediocre Attack of the Clones. I will keep my original VHS tapes of the REAL trilogy and not this crap. For REAL fans, the best option is to transfer the VHS tapes to DVD/CDROM until Lucas does the right thing and relases the REAL trilogy on DVD, not his botched special edition attempt. As for the best trilogy on DVD? Lord of the Rings, by far. When the original Star Wars Trilogy goes on sale then it will be a close race, but not the crappy special edition. All of you who think this version is better than the original probably paid to see Gigli on theaters, get a clue!"
5,What Can I Say?,"Well, what can I say about the Star Wars Trilogy that hasn't already been said? True, George Lucas screwed with it again. True, it may be advertising Episode III a lot. But not only is this the most anticipated DVD box set ever, it is a collection of movies that are a cultural phenomenon. These movies changed history, not just movie history, but cultural history as well. And I have to say, I think they are damn fine movies. The newer ones excluded. Enjoy them for what they are because they are finally on DVD with excellent special features and can now be seen on the excellent quality of DVD format. Enjoy them for their excellent storytelling techniques and the vision and creativness that went into making them. Enjoy them for the sadness and happiness they make millions around the world feel. But do not dislike them simply because Lucas changed a little bit and it is advertising his next movie. That would be silly and narrow-sighted to the big picture."
5,The BEST movies ever!!!!!,"The first time I watched Star Wars was a week ago. I really wish I had watched them sooner because episodes IV, V, and VI are my new favorite movies. I watched this version of the movies and I think that they are amazing. I don't think I would watch them any other way. I understand why some people would be mad since these are not the versions that they grew up with, but they will be the versions I grew up with (I'm only fifteen) so I will buy these versions when I grow up. I am hooked on Star Wars now and I can't wait to watch them again."
5,Trilogy,"Not much to say other than if you like Star Wars, here is a way to get three of the older (original) movies at once. The packaging is great and the movies are in great condition."
5,Awsome!,Three of the best movies ever in the best image and sound format! 35 years old and look perfect! The sound and image are incredible!
4,A FAN FROM THE BEGINING - Age 7 in 1977,"Lucas, always the marketing Genious - I will wait for the definitive multi-disc-blu-ray-Set with ALL the films and ALL the Versions INCLUDING the Original Theatrical Version, the Extended 1990's Versions, the Out-Takes (you know there MUST be more he has held back) and Interviews with the original cast (after 30 years) - I would hope for an ULTIMATE STAR WARS FAN BOX SET including all the Animated Movies. Don't count on him including the 1978 TV Wookie Holiday Special though - but if you have seen it, you will see why.Mr. Lucas, we all love you and your films, but please don't make us wait until WE ORIGINAL FANS who grew up with the films are in our wheelchairs before giving us what we ALL want - A BLU-RAY EXTRAVAGANZA!"
4,We Want The Original Release Versions.,"Okay, it's better than nothing but I wish it was the original versions I saw in the theater. The extra footage really doesn't add anything. I guess I'll just ignore it."
3,STAR WARS BLU-RAY,There are no special features on these blue-rays just some old audio commentaries. Compare this set to the great back to the future blu-ray box set which on each blu-ray has three hours of special features. Granted the picture and sound are better than the old dvds but thats it Talk about cheap lucas and fox really SUCK.....
1,Originals Vote,"Another vote for the Original release... Actually I'd like to have both in one set, the Original release and the touched up version (mostly to compare)."
1,Bait and Switch: wait for the original version on DVD,"This release is of the re-edited version Lucas put out in 1997, incorporating new, more cartoony elements that ruin the atmosphere of the original films. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. They appear to have continued work on these films, creating even more footage to be wedged into the films, including adding a shot of the prequels' Anakin Skywalker, Hayden Christensen, into the end of Return of the Jedi. You can easily find this shot online if you look for it. It's upsetting. It's a bait and switch: this isn't the movie anyone grew up with. George Lucas doesn't seem to know when to leave well enough alone, and his films and his fans are suffering for it. Don't buy this now; wait until they release the original editions on DVD, which they most definitely will."
1,Not Pleased,"Lucus could just as easily release both versions on DVD to please everyone, but do you think he cares one bit about his fans other then their money? Of course not. I urge everyone to sign the petition for the original trilogy on DVD. There are about 60,000 signatures there right now. Maybe if the number grows to 500,000 signatures he might change his tune.. not wanting to miss out on the extra money."
4,I want the original!,"I don't like the SE releases, the original is just better. I wish they'd release them in their original form and let people decide themselves. The other thing about this release is that it doesn't even say Special Edition on the cover and I think it should. It seems everything released after the original releases on VHS that Lucas Films have lost their attention to detail."
2,Older folks will be disappointed,"This is straight from the PR folks at Lucasfilm:The Blu-ray discs will feature the 1997, 2000, and 2003 versions of the film, with additional edits made by the filmmaker. There is now one definitive version of the films thanks to technological advances, which have made it possible to achieve the visual effects the filmmaker originally intended. This will be the version released on Blu-ray.So I hope this answers some questions."
3,"Nice crisp blu-ray picture, but not the movies I grew up with","When I was 10 years my parents took me to see Star Wars. WIthin the first 5 minutes I whisper ""This is my kind of movie!"". My brother drove me to Ridglea theater in Fort Worth several of the 7 times I saw that movie the summer of 1980. The one and only movie I saw with my dad just the two of us was Return of the Jedi in 1983 (he wasn't sure who Dark Raider was). Seeing a favorite movie again evokes memories not only of the movie itself but also of the experience of seeing the movie, where you saw it, who you saw it with... unfortunately these movies on blu-ray are not exactly those movies. They are substantially the same, but each time one of the ""special edition"" add-ons shows up, it interrupts the memory of the original experience of these movies. Hopefully Disney will do the right thing and release these movies back to their fully restored (not revised) original theatrical content."
5,Great movies!,"I bought these movies for my 6 year old. I think they are a little too old for him, but he loves them."
1,A new hope?,"I thought the title was Star Wars. I'll give the money to the original one, the only one."
1,Lucas flips the bird to his real fans,"What a tragedy these DVDs are. We finally get them and he tinkers yet again. Lucas clearly has obsessive compulsive disorder and these movies are proof. He can't leave well enough alone. Furthermore, he refuses to at least do the decent thing and release ONE version for those of us who'd like to see the originals."
1,We waited all these years for this?,"I was extremely disappointed to learn that this release will not be of the original versions, but instead the inferior ""special editions"" in which Lucas added new digital special effects and altered scenes to make them more politically correct, such as Greedo now shooting first before he's taken out by Hans Solo. I'm not sure I understand why Lucas didn't include both versions on the discs like Speilberg did with his recent release of ET. I'm going to pass on this release and stick to my old VHS versions of the originals."
2,Not the original,"These movies are definitley not the original movies that we all saw 25 years ago, but if you can live with all the new special effects they are fine. All kids love these movies because they are up to date but they do not even look as good as the original ones. The Jabba and Greedo scenes in A New Hope are pretty bad. I think they should re-release the original films and that would make people much happier. The best thing about this setI think is the bonus DVD."
1,Boycott! No theatrical release!,"The money grubbing narcissitic greed wh*re George Lucas has once again ignored the multitude of Star Wars fans who have made him a billionaire and refused to include the far superior original theatrical releases on blu ray. Instead we are subjected to his megalomanical unchecked ""special editions"" which in his sick twisted mind he believes are superior to the films that made him and were a worldwide phenomenon. He hasn't created anything worth viewing in decades and he won't get my money again."
1,"Classic, doesn't mean classic to Lucas","Like others here I was befuddled when I originally saw this disc set at my local store and quickly snatched it up looking it over for a glimpse that my prayers have been answered and Lucas released a remastered version of the original films from my childhood including the original ewok song ending to Ep. VI. Believing that the use of the ORIGINAL artwork for the discs' box and no mention of the special editions on the box I bought a copy happy that I had in fact just missed this release due to my busy work schedule leading up to the holidays, but an hour later I was ready to call Lucasfilm and raise hell with their deceptive marketing practices.DO NOT BUY THIS SET. If you want this set pay a bit more and get the bonus disc, Lucas must be made to understand that the fans WANT the original CLASSIC films on DVD, not some repackaged gimmick to pry more money from his fans."
1,False advertising. Does not include 'the original trilogy',"This product does not include the original star wars trilogy, but is rather an accumumlation of unforgivable changes from 1997, 2004, and 2011 that serve to ruin classic films.From what I have read and clips I have watched, Greedo still shoots first, terrible looking cgi aliens are jammed in or replace classic characters, boba fett has a different voice, vader looks like episode III anakin without a helmet and as a ghost... Before you do something silly and buy this set, please check out Obi-Wan's new krayt dragon call and Vader's new line of ""No... NOOOOOOOOOOO"" at the climax of episode VI... Think long and hard about whether George Lucas deserves any of your money.I will be happy to buy the star wars films of the 1970's and 1980's if they are ever released, but I will not spend money on this garbage.I encourage all real star wars fans to avoid this product and give it a one star review."
2,Greedo didnt shoot first,"Well, I would welcome this set if it were the original theatrical releases, but every time George releases these films, he manages to change more of history in the process. For those of you too young to know the truth-these films are not the original theatrical releases, and farther from it than you might think. All I can say is that HAN SHOT FIRST, period. George Lucas gets rich, we get revisionist history. Would you want to watch Casablanca in color?Did you know that in this DVD version of Jedi, Lucas has superimposed the face of that Hayden actor onto the face of the original Anikin Skywalker at the end of the movie when Luke is the only one to see their Force lifes? Amazing that Lucas has done this, just amazing. Dont buy these films, find the orginal on Laserdisk or old-VHS, then burn them to DVD on your own. GREEDO DID NOT SHOOT FIRST!"
1,Not Interested in the Remakes,"I'll take my Star Wars IV - VI in Original (you can keep 1-3, they were not good), and my Lord of the Rings in Extended please. Otherwise no Blu Ray purchase from me."
1,so sad,"I have always been surprised that there hasn't been more of an outcry over changes in the music particularly in ROTJ. It is painful to sit through the new jaba music-carton section and the music at the end that replaces the ewok song is so bad. so cheesey. just another reason to hate the ""New Versions"". in some ways i am looking forward to new changes since the old ones were so bad maybe these will be updated. blablabla"
5,No need to say it!!!,"Everbody knows Star Wars. If you like adventure, comedy, action and love story it's all here. Just buy it!"
3,Read for YOURSELF what Lucas thinks of his fans,"Type the link below in your browser and read the notes from an interview with Lucas and the Associated Press on Sunday 19 Sep 2004.My jaw is still on the floor!Bottom Line:1) As it stands right now...Lucas has no intention whatsoever to release the original trilogy on DVD...EVER!2) He couldn't care less what his fans think.3) He is willing to spend millions to create a product that many fans DON'T want, but unwilling to spend millions on a product that many fans DO want. Huh?!PLEASE READ the interview!!!!!http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132871,00.html"
1,Flagrantly false advertising,"I just picked up this DVD at a store. The back of the box indicated the set had ""the 3 classic star wars films digitally remastered and restored."" There was NO mention that it also included the extra scenes inserted by Lucas that have made these DVDs so hated by the fans of the ORIGINAL triology.So if you're like me and you've been waiting for Lucas to re-release the original triology, this isn't it."
1,MISSING: 3 of the greatest movies of all time.,"How dare George Lucas desecrate my childhood like this!!! Sure, go ahead George butcher my precious Star Wars a little more. The Special Features documentary is kick ass. The rest of it is just depressing. By rest of it I mean, the poor CG effects, the deleted scenes that never should have been added in, the pitiful new Jabba the hut scene. I can't bear to go on, I'm becoming over come with the need to break out my ancienct VHS copies."
1,"""Star Wars"" fans shouldn't bother with this one.","I recently purchased a used laserdisc player and all three original ""Star Wars"" films in their original theatrical versions. Why? Because of this monstrosity. Even the extras are dissapointing (I rented them off of Netflix) since the bulk is a 150-minute MTV-style documentary, about 10 minutes of which is actually interesting. Really, I'm a die-hard ""Star Wars"" fan but this won't ever be on my shelf. Pick up Lucas' ""THX 1138"" for an example of how an update should be done. Then again, Lucas should learn to listen to his fans more or just stop watching his own films. At the very least he could have put the original versions on here IN ADDITION TO the newer versions."
1,"Why George Lucas, Why!!!??????","What did we do to deserve this, George Lucas? The old version of these movies were fine! That is why you have millions of dollars. Are you so bored that you feel that you have to fix things that are'nt broke? All us fans really wanted was to have clean, brand new, dvd versions of the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES, and you have to deny us that. Wasn't Attack Of the Clones, and Phantom Menace enough punishment? We don't need new scenes with all this computer graphic stuff in it. Save it for your new movies. I'm not even a huge fan of Star Wars, but This dvd set upsets me for all of your hardcore fans. I should go get my laserdisc player fixed because that's the only way I'll be able to see the original movies on a disc! Oh, by the way. I can't wait till Revenge of the Sith comes out!! yeah, right."
4,Almost Perfect,"Obviously you can't really complain about star wars because it's such an incredible story. My only gripe about this new release is a completely inappropriate and even irreverent change made to episode 6, return of the jedi. After all evil is defeated and they are celebrating victory on the moon of endor, you see the ghosts of yoda, obi-wan, and anakin. This is where my gripe comes in...instead of just leaving it the way it was, lucas decided it would be a good idea to impose hayden christiansen's image. I say if they were going to ruin it why not go all the way and throw in ewan mcgregor and then it would be a complete sham. I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way. To end on a positive note, the graphics were much better and it was a welcome addition to the media library."
1,Don't buy this,"Don't take this wrong, this is one of the best set of movies ever put out. So why isn't there a DVD. These movies are to good to only have a VHS format. Don't buy this until George Lucas quits being greedy and releases it on DVD."
3,screw Lucas,"okay the dude who says for the ""old generation"" to stop whining about the changes to the classic trilogy has some flawed logic. first of all everyone has a right to complain...that's what being American is all about and secondly we are the people who made the trilogy the huge success it is because we loved that trilogy. now Lucas has every right to go and make the changes he wants to make for a directors cut or expanded edition of whatever he wants, but i think it is complete bullsh*t that he will not release the orginal trilogy for people to buy. it proves that he has very little interest in what the fans want and is more interested in what he can do with all those neat computers out at the Skywalker Ranch. but then again you probably thought the Matrix movies were pretty sweet too so i guess you can't account some people's taste."
2,movie set,"The box for the movies was somewhat damaged when it arrived. Also, one of the dvd's is damaged and will freeze at the same spot when it is played. The shipment did arrive on time, but overall, I am dissatisfied with this particular product."
4,Yaaaaaay!,"The long awaited DVD boxset is back and badder than ever, and chock full `o' nuts - and by ""nuts"" I mean special features, crystal clear digitally restored movies, and lots of gizmos. Get it in wiiiiiiiiiiiiiide screen for full Kung Fu effect.It delivers what it promises and promises what it delivers. Its tall on promise and short on delivery - wait... anyway, the Star Wars Trilogy presents the future, and who knows the future better than Molvania's own techno-pop duo, Zlad! ""Supersonik - Electronik""""Hey baby, wake up from your asleep. We have arrived into the future."""
5,Star Wars Trilogy,"To all of you who are bashing Lucas just remember thisYOU DID NOT MAKE THE STAR WARS TRILOGY, YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO SAY WHAT GEORGE LUCAS CAN OR CAN'T DO WITH HIS FILMS, THESE ARE HIS FILMS NOT YOURS"
3,confusion?,"I do not get it.. I mean, is nothing sacred?So Lucas doesn't want the originals released, ever again? But.. they were actually... good compared to the trash he's sticking his name to now.I can understand some changes. But, to me, changing your movies because you can seems.. slightly hypocritical to me.I thank God that only George Lucas seems to think that changing amazing movies with unnecessary details is necessary. I mean, what if Francis Ford Coppola just, decided that he wanted the Kool-Aid guy to kill off Michael Corleone's brother at the toll booth in the Godfather series? He wouldn't. And you know why? Because Francis Ford Coppola isn't a tool like George Lucas is.And another thing, Hayden Christensen CAN NOT ACT. I guess it's good that he's replacing the other guy at the end of ROTJ, all he has to do is stand there and look pretty, and NOT speak. In my opinion, it'll be his best work to date."
1,This is not the BluRay reviews you are looking for......,"Just a note to everyone. NONE of these reviews listed below review the BluRay edition. All these reviews are discussing the old DVD release. There is no review available for the BluRay edition. Shame on Amazon for tacking on the DVD reviews to this product. I have no idea if this BluRay set is the same as the DVD set, or not. Some clarification by Amazon would be greatly appreciated!"
1,Do not be fooled,"These are not the original versions, not even the 1997 or 2004 editions, it seems Lucashas once again changed his mind, and made more alterations, this time too much to ignore.My pre-order is canceled, and for such an avid Blu Ray collector, it's a bit gutting, but it isthe right thing to do.I shall stick to my DVD copies."
2,When will we see the original theatrical versions?,"This blu-ray collection DOES NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS. I have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the original versions of the films to be released properly. Will it ever happen for us? So far, we have the ""Limited Edition"" dvds, which contain the original theatrical versions, but that's it. Everything else seems to be the ""Special Editions."" The ""Special Edition"" versions of the films are as insulting as... ...as touching-up the Mona Lisa using crayons, and adding a mustache! Okay, I went a little overboard there, but I remain firm on this. I will not purchase Star Wars on blu-ray unless it has the original theatrical versions."
1,"I won't buy the so-called ""Special Editions""","There's no excuse for not releasing the Original versions of the trilogy to dvd. Lucas can do whatever he wants with the movies, as long as that doesn't mean pretending the original versions don't exist. That's what he is doing, however.These will be even further enhanced with additional changes made since the 1997 theatrical releases. George Lucas has ruined these movies, for both first-generation fans as well as future fans. Changing something permanently that so many people contributed to is unforgivable. The special effects were groundbreaking, but future viewers will not be able to see film history as it really was. Lucas has wiped it out in favor of computer generated effects and such.Some people feel this doesn't matter. If movies matter to you at all- if they hold any importance to you whatsoever- you will consider boycotting this release. Whether it's music, movies, books, paintings-- art, whether the fine arts or pop-art, needs to be preserved."
1,Glad I still have the Laser Discs!,"I would much rather watch episodes IV-VI on Laser Disc as they are the ORIGINAL unaltered theatrical versions. Until Lucas gives us that on Blu-ray, I will hang on to my LD's. All he has to do is include both versions in the set and let the consumer choose the version they want to watch. WHY IS THAT SO HARD?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!"
1,No Star Wars on HD or Blu Ray,"I visted 30 links, 70 forums, and posted more messg then Santa has on his Christmas list.And the answer was THERE IS NO PLANS FOR START WARS TO COME OUT ON HD OR BLU RAY.I found 50 posts when i seached google, about amazon having this post and its upseting people as there will not be any Star Wars for Blu ray or HD.So best you can do is buy the new Star Wars DvD and play it with a HD ""up-convrt."".......thats as good as it gets my lads.Good Bye,"
1,freld that up,Man George WTF man why would to Frell up your own work like thatOk the added Jaba's seen in episode 4 I could deal with but the added dance seen in Jedi and changing the ending showing party's on other planets realy they did now hear of the news that fast and there still under empire control they were not boogieing and shooting off fire works its not like Ewok's had long-range communication the only thing worse you could have done is put Walkie talkies in the hands of the storm troupers like in the re-release of ET some one take this mans camera and send him a copy of sassier or anti CG script please
5,Stars Wars DVD is on its way to my home,"My girlfriend ordered the Star Wars DVD set for my birthday that already passed. I cannot wait to see it. All you cry babbies who complain Lucas ""runied your film"" need to get a life. There his films and he can do whatever he wants with them. He made the best trilogy ever and you guys want to complain about the new special effects. Would you rather see the string holding up the spaceship or would you rather see crisp, clear effects, as well as good story telling.Other reviewers are correct. Everyone who is complaining either has ordered already (probably a year ago) or is too cheap to buy it and must lash out at everyone else."
1,Come on George............,"Just give us the originals, no enhanced effects, mono sound, and original poster packaging. Thats all we want. Your marketing guys need to be fired. I seen Star Wars 8 times in the theater in 1977, give us back our childhood, please?"
1,NO THEATRICAL CUTS = NO SALE,"I don't understand why George Lucas refuses to give fans a high-quality transfer release of the original theatrical cuts of the Star Wars trilogy. For those of us who don't like the tweaks, the lame revisions (Han shot first) or the overdubbing (I liked the original Boba Fett, thanks very much), this release is just another slap in the face to film buffs, historians, and preservationists.They say if you whitewash something long enough, people will cease to remember it. Sadly, that's what Lucasfilm seems to want to do - whitewash the superior versions of the Star Wars films until newer generations don't know any better.Shame."
2,"after some time, I think - yeah, it does matter","I bought the DVD set thinking I wouldn't really care about the changes. Han Solo does that stupid CGI shifting when Greedo shoots at him, and I thought: Yeah, so what? Tons of other changes pepper the movie. But now, after owning the movies for awhile, I really DO care about the changes. They annoy me, they make my eyes roll, and now....well, now they even make me NOT want to watch the movies anymore. They just sit there on my shelf, all because I don't feel like watching the movie with my eyes rolling or my complaining sighs. Yeah, it matters. I want the originals. Sigh."
1,George Lucas is a money-grubbing scumbag,"I grew up loving Star Wars, and then when it was FINALLY released on DVD, I was highly disappointed, because the editions were the poorly bastardized versions that Mr. Lucas keeps putting out.This edition is the same. If you want a newly styled package, this is the set for you. Otherwise, BOYCOTT George Lucas and his lust for money, and DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.Wait for Lucas Films to remaster (not REDO) the original-original movies, and put them on DVD. No more revising of history -"
1,"The true ""Original Trilogy"" on DVD . . .",". . . cannot be found in this set. Just google ""original trilogy,"" sign the petition, and read the forums to find out more. Though the set offered here may have nicer sound and a cleaner picture, ""not all that glitters is gold."" Please don't support this attempt by George Lucas to rewrite history and destroy our true memories."
1,"Enough, George!","Come on, George, enough! This ridiculous CGI nonsense is garbage. Stop messing with the films, and give us the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES already! If you had to mess with them, you could at least have done a decent job of it. Look at how realistic the Lord of the Rings films looked. Now THAT'S how you do effects. But if you're going to do the crappy CGI stuff, don't bother doing anything at all!I just can't understand WHY it is so hard to just give the fans what they want. Stop assuming what fans want and insisting on forcing this crap down their throats, and give them what they are actually asking for!"
1,George Lucas is psychotic,"Anyone that likes the idea of the new ""improvements"" on the Star Wars dvds doesn't really appreciate the originals. George Lucas didn't have the money or technology for flashy special effects, so he relied on a solid story, and (for the most part) good acting. That is why his movies are as popular as they are. It is not because of special effects, and there is just no need to put in new scenes. Even if they weren't that good, it would be understandable if Lucas wanted to put in scenes he had to leave out in '77. But these are new and unneeded additions. My personal opinion is ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""I wouldn't even care about this release either, if Lucas was offering the originals as well. But since he decided to pursue this holy quest for the ""perfect"" Star Wars, I have decided not to buy this dvd set, and to let my friends and family know not to buy it."
1,Not the original!!! Same stupid edits I didn't want! Don't buy false advertisement!,"Could not be more upset. I did not want the stupid computer edits edition. Wish I had known, returning to get a refund. Don't buy if you want the actual original movies, I guess we're all just out of luck."
1,My VHS tapes are showing age.,"Seriously George, buddy, you did something great and created a world that we all love and cherish. Then you told us it wasn't good enough and that it needed to be changed. Well most of us don't feel the same way and think that it was perfect just the way it was. Its yours to do with what you want, but I honestly will not be purchasing this product unless it really is the Star Wars i grew up with and loved. You have a great opportunity here to regain the trust and loyalty of legions of fans, don't waste it."
1,Outraged!,"If you have any love for the original ""Star Wars"" Trilogy you WILL NOT buy this set! Lucas knows that even if it sucks, we will pay for anything that has the name ""Star Wars"" written on it. By saying, ""Well, it's the lame-o Special Edition, but it's better than nothing"" and shelling out hard earned money for this set, you're just playing into his hands! We need to rise up against Lucas! He has gone to the Dark Side! Send a message that he had no right to change OUR movie just because HE wasn't satisfied with it. This trilogy is bigger than him, and it's bigger than all of us! So go forth and protest, and may the Force be with you.PS-I actually give it ZERO stars, but that wasn't an option."
1,Star Wars came out in the 70's,"Ok, so I will probably buy this release of Star Wars just as I have waited at some store until midnight to buy every other re-release of Star Wars because that is part of what makes us Fanboys (seriously, watch that movie). However, I would still rather watch it as it was originally released and on VHS. I quote Linus from Fanboys, ""you have to keep the flaws, the puppets, the crappy effects."""
2,Why George Why?,"This is blatant false advertising, this is not the OT but the much reviled SE. The picture transfer is top notch but Ive heard complaints about the 5.1 mix. The extras are ok but are weak compared to what PJ did with LOTR. Give us the OT George."
1,Lame movies,"I dont understand how anybody can stand the star wars movies, I tried to watch them, but everytime I tried to watch any of them, I fell asleep, couldnt stand to watch the whole thing. Then they decided to make more of the crap series, lets come out with better movies instead of all that fantasy tooth fairy, and the magic princess crap. Or I want to live in outer space, and be a whatever......terrible movies, wouldnt bother even trying to buy this collection."
4,Whats up with all this widescreen,"I mean it dosen't make sense at all for us lovers of fullscreen..First of all Attack of the clones came out with both options either wide screen or full screen which is how it should now be adopted.Most movies now have the full screen version on one side and the wide screen version on the other, perfect,This accomodates everyone.What totaly perplexes me is George lucas (The True King of the film indutry) released the Attack of the Clones along with all of the Indiana Jone's trilogy as optional wide screen format/or full screen.But now I here the original Star Wars trilogy is offered only in wide screen.Whats up with this. Is this a technical thing.If someone from either Amazon/Fox or lucas film could exsplain to me why we are not offered the specific version we want (full/wide)It would be gratfully appreciated and end alot of debate I have had with others.Thanks p.s please excuse me if the original trilogy is optionalre:full/wide formatsJohn M,"
1,Please give us the original versions!!,"Why must we have our childhood memories twisted and shattered? Why can we fondly remember the awesome special effects that help revolutionize movie-making for generations? Lucas, you used to be cutting edge and innovative.. stop being greedy and give the fans what we want. I don't care for your changes, I don't want your changes!!"
1,An insult to your real fans,"George, you slapped us in the face with your crappy Bonus Disc version of the originals--throwing a laser disc copy of the theater originals onto a DVD. Thanks so much for that. Everyone give this a 1 star to help George know again how many fans he is dissapointing by only transferring the Special Edition onto a nice Blu-Ray copy."
3,Better than nothing.....,"Well, if you are looking for all three movies in their original theatrical form, they're here. And you get the enhanced versions as well. And I'm not totally against the enhanced versions, even though at times A New Hope looks like a cluttered mess. But if you are expecting to see the original versions in anything better than a less-than-crystal clear, non-anamorphic form, you will be disappointed. The fact that the films are merely considered an ""extra"" on the Bonus disks tells you about all you need to know. And setting my TV to ""zoom in"" to try and cut down on the top and bottom black bars only makes the flaws in the transfer more obvious.It's unfortunate that the long-time fans aren't really asking for much -- clean versions of the movies they saw in the theaters -- and that George Lucas refuses to give them that one simple thing.But, as I said in my title, I suppose it's better than nothing. And for the price, I'll gladly take this and pass on the Blu Rays."
2,"Does NOT include ""original"" theatrical versions!","Just another Lucas ""re-issue"". The ""claims"" of the ""original"" theatrical releases included in this set are FALSE. The only reason that I purchased this was because I thought that I was purchasing copies of the un-touched ""original"" movies that I saw in my youth. NOT the crap that has been added to, re-released and corrupted countless times..."
1,"Not buying until we get remastered '77, '80', and '83 versions","Memo to George Lucas: I am not buying any more of your movies until you give us the REMASTERED films as they were ORIGINALLY. Han shoots first. Hayden Christiansen's ghost does not appear at the end of ROTJ. The original nub nub Ewok music is put back into the film, and the original Jabba's Palace band music is restored, etc. etc. Get the picture? You can do it, George. And don't tell us that the original negatives for these films no longer exist, because I don't believe you. If you think you are going to keep me buying and rebuying and rebuying the same product over and over and over again, then think again, because I'm not coming along for the ride.I repeat: As soon as you release the original 1977, 1980, and 1983 versions of the films AS THEY WERE ORIGINALLY - and they MUST be remastered - not grainy laserdisc transfers. Then, and ONLY then, can you have any more of my money.Just give the fans what they want. Is that too much to ask?"
3,Too expensive and the quality can be a problem,"I bought this Star Wars Original Trilogy set (which had the theatrical versions as a bonus disk) in 2006 at regular prices. Today Amazon is selling this set used at $93.99 + $3. And new the cheapest available price is $209.50 + $3!You should know that on my 50 inch TV the theatrical version does not fill the screen from side to side. This is because the DVD image is in a very old format (it is not anamorphic). So, I need to zoom the image to get the picture to fill the screen. This expands the film grain and dirt (which wasn't cleaned up very well on this release). Bottom line; on my large TV, these movies don't look very good.Are the theatrical versions worth it at these prices? It depends how badly you want it. This is the only original theatrical version of the 1977-1983 Star Wars trilogy released on DVD."
3,Not Wars' finest hour...,"This movie isn't that great. I am glad, however, that it spawned more movies, which were good. I mean, it's OK, but the best one is Return of the Jedi!"
2,No thanks,"As soon as I saw that the excruciatingly annoying Hayden Christiansen Anakin is supposed to replace the Anakin ghost in Return of the Jedi, I checked out of this one. Don't get me started on the Jabba musical number. I guess this means we can look forward to NSync being in the special edition of Attack of the Clowns."
1,^^^^^^^,Agreed. Just do the originals. I haven't heard whether or not these are going to be the originals or the later ones with all the added nonsense but if it is I will not be buying it (which is sad considering I own the film in VHS and DVD format and would love to add it to my BluRay Collection).
4,"Fantastic movies, slightly ruined by changes","I have always been a fan of the ""original"" Star Wars Trilogy. They have better story lines and dialogue as opposed to the prequels. I have owned the vhs boxset for years, and then I saw this and bought it. I have to admit, I love how they restored it. The colors are stronger, and there is less ""scratches"". However, one major thing that ruined my experience was that they made LOTS of changes, They put in a scene in episode IV with Jabba, The emperor in episode V looks different, and Anakin skywalker's force ghost is hayden christiansen instead of Sebastian shaw in episode VI. (the music at the end is different too.) Overall, if you want the original, unedited, versions (which i like better) Buy the VHS. However, because tapes are getting old, you may want to convert them to dvd. If you want to experience something new, than get this. Oh by the way, I know this box set comes with the original editions, but it is presented in a tiny letterbox!"
5,Great Bonus footage for the Star Wars fan!,I would reccommend this set to anyone still using the VHS version of this. I couldn't believe my eyes what I'd been missing in the way of extras and special effects. A must buy!
3,revisions,"Yes, its true these are his movies, But remember everyone that he got rich from us paying to see those movies. So in a way he gave them to us. These are characters most of us grew up with, a part of are past if you will. Im sorry but it is arrogent for a writter or film maker to think his or her work belongs to just themselves when they get their fame and fortune from us.If they truely feel that way, then why do they publish their works? In a sense they're giving their works away, so that everyone can enjoy them and I thank them for that. I dont mind the improvements, but I would still like to see the movies I grew up with.If only he would released both the original versons and his improved versions, I would have no doubt that everyone would buy both. It just sucks when I only have the old origials to show my kids on VHS."
3,"High Def. was just on Spike tv recently, why not slap them on blu ray?","I recently just watched the original star wars trilogy, unaltered, as they first appeared in theaters, in high def. on spike tv. I don't understand why that oaf lucas can't just throw the exact same thing onto some blu-ray discs to satisfy millions, maybe billions of people.On a side note, I've always thought that Lucas is a talentless clown and the movies were supposed to be terrible. And they would have been, if it weren't for the accidental genius of john williams, harrison ford, james earl jones etc.The real Lucas can be seen in episode I, which is the crapfest that he originally dreamt up."
4,a long time ago.....,"yep you know the story, played with the toys, taken the lunch to school in the lunch box etc. yet the fans have been crying out for a dvd release for years.and for me and the fans mr lucas I say a big THANK YOU :) but why did you have to tinker, don't get me wrong the some of the graphics are an improvement and add to the story its just some some part just don't work, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give the fans what they want in the next box set (yes you know all six will be comeing out one day) allow the users to select what version they wish to watch personnaly I miss the old ewok tune and would love to have the origial tattoni back, jabbas part really feels out of place and slows the pace of the movie.other than that this is one cracking transfer, my old laserdisk was put to shame. all in all 4 stars"
2,Originals Are Available In DVD,"I don't know why everyone is complaining about the new versions. If you don't like the changes (I don't), then buy the originals on DVD.I have a very nice DVD version of the originals without Lucas' 1997 edits that I bought in NYC."
1,Extra's ruin a classic,"Only twice have i ever been so disappointed with the movie world. Once was the collective disappoint that i have over George's prequel which is a whole nother review. And twice when i saw the ""Special Editions"". I would agree that the cleaning up of old scenes and additions of background animartion to the films was a magnificiant idea, but i physically shudder when i think about the additions of the so called cut scenes. Personally i have never seen anything as [bad] as the Jabba Han Solo scene in ""A New Hope"". Add that to the horrifying musical scene, and replacement of the original ending in Return of the Jedi and you have killed the star wars experience for this life long star wars fan. In the end this viewer finds the upgrade a detestable mess, and wishes that he would have never seen the ""Special Editions"". Do yourself a favor and by the THX upgrades that came out a few years before this [stuff]came out."
1,HELL NO!,"NEVER!!! I WILL NEVER BUY THIS BLU RAY SET!!! Just so Lucas can get even more money for these abominations! I'm sure I speak for many fans when I say that I want the ORIGINAL unaltered trilogy. No Greedo shooting Han first, no Hayden Christiensen in Return of the Jedi, no fornicating cgi Jawas in the background. I will not make the same mistake I made buying the 2004 dvd releases, I urge every Star Wars fan NOT to buy this version. Do the talking with your wallets and do not buy this set cuz the only thing George Lucas understands is MONEY and if he doesn't get any than maybe he will come to his senses and release both ""HIS"" versions and the ""REAL"" versions in one set, which would be the logical release!"
1,Say no to revisionist history,"I would gladly pay twice this amount for the original unaltered movies on blu-ray, warts and all. This set contains only the altered 'special edition' versions, NOT the original versions. Be warned Star Wars fans this is not the box set you are looking for..."
1,Just bought me a used LaserDisc player...,"Just bought me a used LaserDisc player and Ebay'd a used copy of the original Star Wars trilogy in widescreen on LaserDisc. Ya know, the one where Han shot first, no ridiculous CGI interspersed with model effects, and other obnoxious changes. I'll be enjoying the untouched and unmolested versions that I remember from my childhood. And you know what Mr. Lucas? I spent nearly *twice* what Amazon is charging for these DVDs. I hope you and your distribution company understand what that means in terms of lost revenue. Because I'm not alone. This coming from a male in his mid-thirties with a six figure income. I'm a good representative of your target demographic, now offended and totally alienated. You blew it, buddy. Here's to market forces giving you a well deserved clue-smack."
1,Butcher up the prequels all you want!,The Prequels already reek. Add more CGI to those and release them. Why not release the original Trilogy as the masterpieces they were? I will not be buying this. I am saddened that so many will put up with this nonsense and buy them anyway.
1,Han Shot First,Nooooooooooo more changes. Please re-release the original trilogy on blu-ray. That would make me really happy and I would be willing to give you some more money in exchange. Thanks.
3,I was stunned,"When I saw Hayden Christenson inserted into the end of ROTJ, I almost fell out of my chair in disgust. I can deal with some of the added special effects, but taking out sebastian shaw was totally unnecessary and ruined the ending."
2,Bollocks!,"There is no reason why both the original and Senor Lucas' remake should not be on these discs. Sure it has been said before, but if enough people sau it maybe Almighty George would listen.Ain't buying it!"
1,Unbelievable,"1 Star for taking THE all time classic and adding in cartoons! I love special editions that let me choose to see deleted/extended scenes, Avatar being a good example; they gave you the option to watch the original opening scene (that wasn't as good as the theatrical release) but made sure you could still watch the theatrical version....This debate only became clear to me when I finally saw the original on vhs again about 5 yrs ago -- it was night and day how the emotional impact hit home ----somehow all the cartoons and extended scenes managed to take away from that impact and distract, rather than enhance.5 Stars for the titled product ""Star Wars: The Original Trilogy"", which this certainly is not."
1,MR LUCAS: We want the TRUE ORIGINAL! - Will forgive U for Episodes I to III,"As many others have stated - true fans want the TRUE ORIGINAL. The fact is: Blu Ray discs have enough space to fit BOTH VERSIONS on them (as pointed out in other reviews). So what is the excuse for not doing so? MR. Lucas - you have been Milking this series for all its worth, for every last penny - can't you reward the fans who have been with you from the beginning. We will forgive you for the last 3 movies if you do this one thing - AND THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF FORGIVING!!!! How can we enjoy the movie the way it was meant to be seen (on Blu Ray), but not enjoy it because it is not what was ""meant"" to be seen!BTW - a lot of the 5 star reviews are not for this Blu Ray release (it is for the earlier reviews of a few years back). Why they are lumped in with this - I don't know."
1,I want the original in blu-ray,"I don't care whether George Lucas includes the butchered ""special editions"" or not. I simply want the versions I knew and loved as a child in the highest quality blu-ray."
1,Why buy the Star Wars Trilogy DVD without a bonus disc?,"I'm sorry but did anyone ever ask for the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition to be released without the bonus features? Second, the title is misleading because this really isn't a Limited Edition as the title so aptly states. Don't be duped into thinking this is the box set for the ORIGINAL EDITIONS of the Star Wars Trilogy.I find the method of releasing the Star Wars Trilogy editions to be quite strange. First there's a Star Wars Trilogy SE DVD set released with a bonus features DVD included. Then there's a Star Wars Trilogy SE DVD set released WITHOUT features. Then there's the new, limited Original Editions of the Star Wars Trilogy released on DVD but there isn't a bonus features DVD!Why can't there be a Star Wars Trilogy edition released with both the originals and the special editions AND the bonus features DVD? Wouldn't that save a lot of hastle?"
1,Not going to happen,"I'm not going to pay for Star Wars on Blu-Ray unless I can buy the original theatrical versions. That doesn't mean haphazardly tossing the old laserdisc transfers onto a disc and calling it good, it needs to be a letterboxed remastering."
2,Clean & Crisp but lacking original flavor,"After I read the reviews, I borrowed the set from a friend. I asked how he liked it and all he said was ""See it for yourself and you decide"". After seeing the revised editions, I have decided that I would much rather see the original trilogy digitalized without all the new edits and changes. I think the edits ruined the set for those true fans of the original Star Wars films. Sorry; I'll keep my original VHS copies safe and protected until the originals are digitalized with upgraded sound and without the unnecessary changes, and I certainly won't be buying any new DVD sets until they are done properly."
2,I'm an old timer and I have a right to whine. Deal with it!,"I think the new enhanced versions are worth the price of the DVD set, but it would have been nice for them to have included all the movie permutations. My desire is based on my fond memories from the 70's of the original movie that I saw in the theater almost 20 times. In fact a lot of us old timers saw it multiple times and that is what helped to make Star Wars such a cash cow. You'd think Lucus would show some appreciation for that and include what we remember best. Bummer!"
5,Star Wars is still number one.,I must say that the final vision of George Lucas' Star Wars Trilogy is unbelievable. I think that anyone who doesn't like the new and updated versions are depriving themselves of having an open mind. I've seen many kids eyes light up like mine did the first time that I saw the movies. I think that we all need to realize that most of us are not movie directors and most specifically not George Lucas. And yes we may be able to have our own opinions but until you can make a movie that can stand the test of time like the Star Wars Trilogy I don't think that any of us can say that George Lucas' visions are not keeping with what we all remember as being those of our childhood.
3,"uuuhhh, okay then","well, i think star wars is the best movie of all time. but,i am getteing sick and tired of waiting for them to come out on dvd. if you're going to make all these really cool special effects, and if you are going to make the movie quality ""better"", why put it on VHS? i think he should concentrate on his new movie, instead of trying to make his old one ""better"". i would like to know just what exactly is wrong with the original movies. yes, compared to the technology today, the special effects are not as good, but that is what makes it so cool. but i do have to say, i probably will buy this."
1,The films have been altered,"The films have been altered from their original theatrical versions. In addition to Darth Vader's ""No Nooo"", the pale lightsaber effects introduced in an earlier altered release have also not been corrected."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! SALE!,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THANK YOU!I can spend this money on other movies that I love that haven't been digitally-defiled by a ""filmmaker"" who can't move on..."
1,More CGI Trash,"I don't know what part of his delusional Ego can't seem to comprehend, his 'Improvements' SUCK. Han shot first, and to say otherwise, makes Han lucky, and nothing more. In the original, He survived because he had enough brains to know Greedo had a gun under the table. In the 'fixed' version, he survived because despite those rediculous bug-eyes, he couldn't seem to hit a stationary target 3 feet away."
5,Wish I had bought the version with extra features.,"I love the films, but now that I have them, they are bringing back so much nostalgia for me that I wish I had spent the extra $20 to get the special version of the same three movies that also comes with lots of special features. I would love to have seen ""the making of.."" and other extras for each of these movies.If you can't afford the more expensive version, this still is terrific!"
3,Still Great Overall!!,"Not the original releases we all know, but these films do look great. They should say SE or something on the set but they don't. I'd be much happier had they not put the young Anakin at the end(my biggest beef with this set and it still would have meshed with the new ones had they just left it alone). That being said these are worth owning. I have heard from inside sources that the original dvds WILL be released(about a year, maybe two) after the Episode III dvd and full 6 dvd set comes out. This trilogy also looks much better than 97 se edition. So what it comes down to is, keep buying all the sets that come out and you will be happy."
1,Avoid at all costs,"C'mon Children of the 70's, stay away from this set like you would the Plague...why you ask? Like any other kid growing up in the late 70's/ early 80's I lived breathed and dreamt Star Wars. But this box set coming out does not contain the movies we grew up on, but instead Mega Ego, er, I mean Lucas' ""Special Editions"" that he came up with 20 years later. If you want to expand on something fine, but leave the original version as it was for the people who remember and more importantly WANT IT THAT WAY!!!! The Who release re-mastered versions of their albums all the time but none of them are so far removed from the original that you can't recognize it. Star Wars from 1977 is a completely different movie from Star Wars the Special Edition 1997...know going in which one you are buying because chances are it's not the one you want..."
1,Anything But The Original!!,"Be Warned.Although the title states their the original trilogy and the packages is the same it is the compromised ""special edition"" version that no one likes. You think the backlash that the DVD release had Lucas and Fox would learn their lesson, but no. They continue to shove this crap down our throats. I can't wait to see the return rate of this box set in a couple week, it will be Guinness worthy. save your money and don't make my mistake. Wait till they release the true original trilogy. give this a thumbs up so customers are aware of the mistake their about to make.Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]"
5,I've got a bad feeling about this...,"WOW. Where do I start...for one, I am a fan of the original trilogy and am also a fan of the special edition releases in '97 (for no other reason than to see A New Hope and the rest in a packed movie house again). Too bad that there has been so much damage done to the franchise, not the least of which is the gross myopia of Lucas himself when he defends that awful mess known as Episode II. I am not going to get into the whole ""keep your hands off our trilogy"" debate, because I think that is a waste of time -- the changes are here to stay people. Unless you have 250 million and the rights to the films, you're stuck with what is out there. I am relieved that Episodes IV - VI are finally coming to DVD and I personally am looking forward to John Williams on my surround sound system at home. Now if the changes made in this release are typical Lucas myopia, well that only means I'll be using the skip button a little more than normal. Out."
1,"Poor, Poor, Poor","Mr Lucas, you have ripped off Star Wars fans long enough. And now you have the gall to release The special editions only on dvd??? Let me say that you only made the movies worse by adding a FAKE looking Jabba The Hut, etc, etc , etc. Dont you think your rich enough?? Why do you insist on continuing to rip off Star Wars Fans? By the way another gripe I have.........Phantom Menance SUCKED and Jar-Jar MUST DIE!!!!"
1,Lucas Won't Get My Money!,"I have a very logical reason for buying DVDs: to recreate the theatre experience in my home. I watched, and enjoyed, the Original Trilogy in the theatre and laserdisc, but these Special Editions are truly distasteful and really show that Lucas was a far superior film maker in 1977 than he is today.If he or his heirs ever release a DVD collection of the critically acclaimed Original Trilogy, then I'm buying, but until then, the wallet is closed!"
4,Great but should have released original theatrical releases,Spielberg did it right with E.T. He demanded that thestudio release the enhanced version of E.T. and theoriginal theatrical release ... giving viewers the option.Lucas should have followed suit and what better format thanDVD to accomplish this. From what I've been reading fromLucas's own mouth he has absolutely no intention of everreleasing the originals which is a shame. Fortunately Iconverted my laserdiscs to DVD so I have the originals preserved in a digital format.That being said I am extremely excited about the prospectof these DVD's FINALLY being released. Unlike a few of thereviews I didn't have a problem with any of the extra scenesand touch ups EXCEPT for the the first film. Han soloscene where he shoots Greedo unprovoked was never a problemwith me ... Han Solo is a bounty hunter he's not out tobe a true good guy .. having Greedo shoot first to justifyHan Solo shooting him doesn't cut it.
1,The Special Edition is AWFUL,"So I hear that the original Star Wars Trilogy will finally be released on DVD this October. It's about time Lucus stopped being such a weenie! :)However... I hear that the versions on the DVDs will be the 20th anniversary ""Special Editions,"" with all the computer-generated extra stuff. I don't know about you, but I want the ""original theatrical"" widescreen versions. I mean, you can enhance the picture quality if you want to, or treat the sound to some THX love, but don't add the other stupid things to the movie we all love!I will NOT buy the DVDs if this is the version they release. If you want to have BOTH versions of each film in the set, like they just did with the Aliens series, then that would be perfect, but please, please, please -don't omit the theatrical versions!-A concerned fan."
1,BOYCOTT,"Thank god I have the real originals on VHS. I didn't buy this crap but I heard enough about it to know that they kept the extra stuff they put into it after they remade it in 97 and added more. That was enough for me not to get it. I don't mind them cleaning it up and making the picture look better but when you start to add stuff, its like why, it was fine the way it was. I don't know what is wrong with Lucas but he has lost it as Episode 1 and to some degree Episode 2 show. He no longer has the creative force with him. He has gotten so greedy which is why I call him Greed Lucas. I'm just going to wait till the price of VHS to DVD copyers go down then copy the moives to DVD. Its not illegal as long as your making a copy just for yourself."
4,A little re-release never hurt anybody,"Do not let all those old pessimists who fear change prevent you from buying this set. In the 2004 release, lucas was able to finish the movies HE made to help bring the entire saga full circle. Now according to previous reviewers nothing beats those good old CBS/VHS tapes, but if you want to experiance the saga the way it was meant to be seen pick up this set. This set is great for those who just want the movies without all the extras. If you enjoy great commentary and documentaries I highly recommend the 2004 realese."
1,Tin not worth the money,There are much better box sets of the original trilogy that cost far less - see here:Star Wars Trilogy. This set isn't worth it.
5,How it was meant to be seen,"The Trilogy is awesome, this is a great version because you can see the original movie and don't have to see all of Lucas' add ins, like the scene with the cartoon Jabba and Han does shoot first(he is a bad muther) like he is supposed to."
1,"Sadly, Not the Original Trilogy.....","I will not be purchasing this set now, or at any time in the future. Sadly, this box-set is NOT the original trilogy. As a movie purist I am shocked and saddened that my favorite childhood movie-memory is being tinkered with by it's own creator. I love the Star Wars saga but for now I'll be content with my laserdiscs, which hold up very well to DVD. Why not offer both versions on the same disc? In my opinion Lucas has ruined the Star Wars world with his prequel movies; Jar Jar Binks? storyline? bad acting? digital worlds? ... and now with this DVD set. Imagine if Lucas had created Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (another favorite) and CG implanted more oompa loompa's into a scene that he felt needed more of them??? That's how I feel, & I'm sure I'm not the only one."
2,Analogy for you....,"Remember when the makers of Coca Cola had the ""brilliant"" idea of making it ""better"" so they re-did the formula and came out with New Coke?? Same idea behind this disaster!Moral of the story: NEVER MESS WITH A GREAT THING!"
5,"At last, the circle is complete...","I seem to be one of a very few ""Original"" Star Wars fans who not only approves but applauds the additions Lucas made to his classic films, and I was also pleased to find the DVD release to consist only of the special edition, rather than bowing to the no doubt enraged orginal fans who wanted the orignal theatrical cuts. George Lucas made a brave move, going back and ""retro fitting"" the orignal movies so they where at least closer to what he originally wanted, and I'm glad to see he didn't try to backtrack by pleasing both camps.Reviewing these films seems pointless as they have become so much a part of culture (wether you realize it or not) that you have no excuse for not seeing them. And if somehow you did miss them, now is your chance to see what you missed.The Trilogy absolutely shines on DVD (and I can finally through out my old VHS copies) and belongs on the shelf of every fan of Star Wars, Science Fiction, or Cinema."
3,Bummer,"The cd's were just what i wonted. The thing is that these have the added CG into the original film. The producers did not do a good job. It looks weird. I know what can be done with CG and this was a cheep run at adding ""cool stuff"" to a set of good old movies. I would say look for the original originals if you want to see the real thing."
1,Hmmm when is the full saga coming George !!,"It's alaways the same, we,ve been waiting years for this to come out and when it does you think to yourself, shall i buy it..I have decided not to, not because i'm not a fan of Star Wars, it's because i'm fed up with, all the film companies releasing colections only to replace them with another special edition anniversary etc etc edition.I know that Mr Lucas is going to put all 6 films in one super collection and when he does you can be sure thats the one I will buy, so people stand up to these people who keep bringing out different and better versions lets just keep it sensible.P.S Bet the collection is in time for Christmas LOL !!!"
5,This is my favourite movie....,"This is a movie that a person (or alien!) can watch over and over again! With an all-star cast including Harrison Ford as the dashing smuggler/pilot, Han Solo, from Corellia...Carrie Fisher as the courageous Rebel Princess Leia Organa from Alderaan....and Mark Hamill -= :o) =- as the ever-popular Luke Skywalker, a Force-strong Jedi Knight from the desert planet of Tatooine...George Lucas' handi-work is displayed in an ingenious fashion which captivates its audience from beginning to the very end...Star Wars has clearly taken its place among the top of the film archives and has stolen the hearts of fans (including myself) all across the galaxy...In the words of my favourite Jedi: ""May the Force be with you...."" The Beginning...."
1,Threepio!,"You tell that slime-sucking, worm-ridden piece of filth that he'll get no such pleasure from us until he releases the theatrical version of the original trilogy! Right?"
2,You are killing me GEORGE!!!!!!,"Once again, Lucas screws everyone in the a**, and releases another Star Wars collection WITHOUT the original theatrical releases. I have no problem with the re-done collection, but include the originals. It's pretty obvious that he's trying to milk Star Wars for all its worth. In about two years from now he'll release the originals with improved sound and picture in its own boxed set. I love the original trilogy, but I will not be purchasing this at all along with the prequel collection, which is its own travesty. There is a reason why Lucas keeps pulling stunts like this, its because the very same people who complain about it are the very first ones in line buying it.There is a South park episode that perfectly illustrates what George Lucas has done to Star Wars. Just go to You Tube and search for ""South Park Lucas Indiana Jones"""
1,It wasn't broke George!,"The CG ""enhancements"" RUIN the movies! I would pay a lot of money to get the ORIGINALS on blue ray. A huge part of the experience is reliving the moments. Nostalgia. If someone wants the latest effects they will watch the prequels or a new movie! It blows me away how clueless these rich movie makers can be. Lucas of all people should understand... ONE STAR PEOPLE. BE HEARD"
1,"No thanks, George.","Not the originals, so you can have them, Lucas. Everyone needs to rate at 1 star and not buy this or the full collection. I wish George really cared about his core fanbase, hell even about making the most money possible would be something. Instead we have to go through another re-release of a product that is wanted by the people that never appreciated the originals, and are not fans, apparently.At least Steve had enough sense not to mess with Raiders."
1,Mr. Money,George has become the big money grubbing studio exec he always hated. Nice job. Talk about Luke I am your father.
3,No more sets untill the Blu-ray edition comes out,"I have a VHS set and the dvd set, George, we're not getting any younger, how many sets do we need? If you come out with a blu-ray edition that has a stellar transfer, fine I will buy it. Why not keep up with the times and release it on it's newest format? You can always release it again when 3-D becomes popular."
4,'Beam me up Sco...' sorry wrong film,"....OK, i'm not sure any review is going to dissuade or convince someone to buy this set...you're either gonna do it or not. But if you do you won't be dissapointed, Star Wars hold up well in my opinion, the story is the best of the three, great action, interesting characters (losing Alec Guiness hurt the series as a whole imo, he was in a way the heart of the film). 'Empire' has aged even better, and although i expected to be dissapointed by 'Jedi' it wasn't as bad as i remembered and is still head and shoulders over the last two ""pre-quels"". (although i still hate the whole 'cute' factor which came about with the furballs) The extras are worth checking out...once. But i'm docking a star for the tweaking Lucas has done on these films...STOP IT! Leave them alone! (although it's not as bad as Spielbergs changing the guns to flashlights bit in ET, the worst example) I'm not thrilled with the packaging but hey, it's the movie that counts!"
4,Star Wars,Pretty standard. The movies got here quickly and will be a Christmas present for my father in law. It's his favorites.
2,Inferior Material Storage,"This product was received on time as expected, however, when the disc were put in the DVD/BluRay players, one of the three disks made a rattling sound. It was inspected and found that that disk was warped and was not spinning properly. All three disks were send back without a problem."
3,let us choose between original and SE,"As the Alien Quadrilogy showed us, giving the fans a choice between two versions of each film is not hard. Why can't I see the movie I fell in love with in 1977? I don't mind it when they clean up the print and remove minor faults, but putting in CGI, just for the sake of using it, is not my cup of tea.(...) I like the Mona Lisa just the way she is, I don't particularly want to see her with a new hat and curly blonde hair. I hate it when they mess with things that are great the way they are.As far as I'm concerned, they can keep on changing SW as much as they like, but unless the original version is included, I'll just keep on watching my old video tape, thank you very much. Call me old-fashioned. I'm grateful for what George Lucas gave us back in 1977, it's the best movie ever in my book, but the SE definitely is not."
1,Not the original.,You know what this is... I want to see the original Star wars series like I remember it as a child. Not this bastardization. To base changes to a masterpiece on a piece of garbage is practically unforgivable.
3,Star Wars Blu Ray Digital Additions Disappointing,"I love the original Star Wars films, but these new blu-rays are filled with George Lucas' digital additions. All in all these additions really hurt the films. I was expecting to find the original versions on the blu-ray but unfortunately they do not exist in HD. What we are left with is an overabundance of extraneous digitally altered junk. These new additions do not look very good either. I could have looked past most of the newer additions but the ending of Return of the Jedi had me reeling in disbelief. Spoiler alert: Hayden Christensen pops up instead of Sebastian Shaw. I was so mad I turned the movie off before the credits could roll. George Lucas is a joke."
5,It's Beautiful,"It's beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Thank you Mr. George Lucas. Next to my computer is a 13 inch flat panel display. I'm watching these three movies over and over and over. I was sixteen when the first movie came out in May 1997 and I got to wait in the long lines to watch it in the theater. I'm so happy these DVDs finally came out."
5,Still a classic but prefer the originals,"Still, Star Warriors will want to add this set to the shelf, along with all the various editions of VHS. Relive the shining innocence of ""Star Wars"", the grim drama of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and the campy fun and stunning special effects of ""Jedi"" once again. May the Force be with us forever!"
2,Only 4 discs?,"I was incredibly disappointed with the Indiana Jones DVDs because they included really what was a pathetic amount of special features. When I saw that Lucas wanted to put Star Wars on DVD, I was exicted, but then I learned that his motivation for doing so was the success of the Indiana Jones Trilogy. I was immediately nervous that he would use the same 4-disc formula. Unfortunately, he has.How could they possibly not fill up at least two discs with bonus material? This is the Star Wars Trilogy, after all! Answer: money. That has been the sole thing guiding Lucas since he began releasing these prequels that don't even deserve the label of ""Star Wars."" Undoubtedly, years from now Lucas will ""re-release"" the DVDs with extra bonus features or something along those lines. Seriously, one bonus disc? I'm disgusted, and if you're a long-time Star Wars fan, you should be, too."
5,The More Things Change...,"Despite making (sometimes major) artistic changes to these films, George Lucas' original trilogy remains one of the greatest stories of our age. These three movies are truly a masterpiece of the magnitude of the Iliad and the Odysee for ancient Greeks."
5,Love or hate it...,"Gripe, gripe, gripe...which is something we could do all day long. I realize that many people (including myself) are passionate about these films, but hey, that's it fellas THEY ARE ONLY MOVIES, great movies nonetheless, but still just movies. I've had it about up to here with ""Han shooting first"", or ""TPM sucked"", or ""Jar-Jar this & that"". Guess what? Lucas created them, Lucas made them, and he can damn well do whatever he pleases with HIS movies. And if we don't like it, we can STOP buying his, tapes, toys, DVD's, collectables, OR make our own movies. Let's put it this way, the expanded universe: comics, graphic novels, short films, books, etc certainly can fill whatever gap is left by any shortcomings you preceive in the films. So enjoy for the sake of what they are, and LIVE WITH IT."
4,"Star Wars Trilogy to be released September 21, 2004","""The most requested films for the DVD format will finally become a reality this September as Lucasfilm Ltd. and Twentieth Century Fox present the eagerly-awaited Star Wars Trilogy for the ultimate home entertainment format. The four-disc collection will be released on September 21 in the U.S. and Canada, with international release dates following closely."" -(from starwars.com) http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/news/2004/02/news20040210.html"
1,"Beware, this is the Special Edition","That other guy doesn't know what he is talking about. This is not the REAL Star Wars. I mistakenly purchased these videos and found out that they have all the horrible added scenes and Lucas ""special touches"". Do not buy this if you are looking for the untouched version of Star Wars!"
1,Same old story...,"The transfer is clearly excellent, but I still refuse to pay for an inferior edit of the trilogy. It's obvious Lucas knows the theatrical versions are in high demand. I don't have a problem with this being released, but it should be available alongside the original edits of the films. It's not even about which versions are better: it's about being given the choice to see whichever version you prefer. If Ridley Scott can provide five versions of one film in a single box set (Blade Runner) and countless other films get two releases (theatrical and director's cut) in one box, then I'm quite sure LucasFilm could and should have provided both versions of the trilogy here.I'm not sure what good it'll do at this point, but there's still a petition over at originaltrilogy.com that might be worth signing if you care about this."
1,Revisionist History,"If you want the ORIGINAL trilogy, don't buy this release. It only includes the inferior ""Special Editions"". When will Lucasfilm learn that we want the ORIGINAL movies remastered in high def?"
1,Move along... move along...,"We already know this is gonna be the same crap with probably even more ""improvements""I will keep my bonus disc original versions from a few years back and have no plans to touch this. I have given Lucasfilm enough money to put an African child or two, in clothing and school for life. It's time to stop and there is why I draw the line.I can only imagine what Jar Jar Lucas is going to do to these versions. Will there be more ships in the background? More aliens in the background? Louder sound effects? An appearance by Jar Jar stinks himself? Who knows? Who cares? I don't. I'm done.Don't even look at buying this release. Just obey the stormtrooper and ""move along."""
1,Original Movies Please,"Dear Mr Lucas,Please sell me the versions I watched in 1977, 1981 and 1983.. NOT your special effects remakes."
1,Theatrical releases please!!!,"I agree with the other posters, bring back the theatrical releases! Mr. Lucas, you were so far ahead of your time, your original releases would still be considered outstanding films by today's special effects and cinematography standards."
1,I'm still looking for the original theatrical versions of the first Star Wars movies.,"I'm very disappointed in Lucas for not releasing his original Star Wars movies in BluRay. I don't want a mucked up ""improved version"" of the originals. Just give us the 'original theatrical' version, in bluray, with the least amount of changes to the original 'character' of the movies. DO IT FOR YOUR FANS, George!"
2,Oh George,"I too am a Star Wars Ho...that is why it was so painful to see the tweaking of this classic set. Why Lucus felt compelled to insert the extra footage (they were omitted for a reason)...I can only guess he wanted to show off his new special effects. The irony is that in doing so, he forfeited his self proclaimed pillar...the story (altering the bar scene where Han Solo shoots the bounty hunter was the final straw for me). I ended up going back to my old VHS set because I could not stomach the editions-additions any more."
3,Mona Lisa,"I just thank God That George Lucas didnt paint the Mona Lisa, If he had his heavy hand would have repainted a smile ear to ear, put blue eyeshadow on her and had a circus and a rainbow in the back ground!But really, Im all for a directors cut..however he should have included the originals ( or is he such a great salesman, that the real star wars will be available next summer for another 50 bucks :P )."
1,Marred masterpieces,"GL shouldn't have messed with the original cuts of the movies. It is impossible for me to watch these films now without my attention being instantly drawn to the changes, as opposed to getting ""lost"" in the excitement of the films. And those changes by and large, are not improvements. For one thing, Jabba (when Han steps on his tail) seems to have shrunk to about 2/3 of his size. Ridiculous. I'll not pain myself by describing the many other offences.I'll not be buying these."
1,Greed!,"I hate this film saga or trilogy, the script is poor, the acting and the directing even worse, i cant understand why intelegent people can watch such a childish and stupid film."
3,uh,yes this movie had some nice thighs and ribs mmmmmhmmmmm. Seriously though when i first saw this movie in '62 it was fort worth night at my landowner and i pooped in the salsa cuz it was beany rock so then i quiver at my Star Wars figurine then i saw the movie in 1994 when they were coming out with cgi and then it was badder. Yeah jubba the hutt was all like sausage and then the new movie came out with my bladder so i was in the clinic and they let me watch 2 and 3 in the clinic. PEACE OUT Y'ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yea movie was gooooood.
1,What's all the fuss about this Garabge?,I dont like star wars at all. I dont understand why many people like it? Dont buy this Piece of Overrated Garbage.
4,Chewbaca,This DVD does not make sense. it has a guy named Chubaca. it does not make sense it does not make ANY sense. He liveso on one planet but not his home planet. It does not make sense. think to yourself does it make sense? if not don't buy it and if so then buy it
1,ummm,"How can you rate this at all? It is August 25, 2004 and its not even released yet. I give it 1 star because I was forced to pick something."
1,Stop living in denial,"This so-called classic science-fiction trilogy is actually warmed-over and dumbed-down Joseph Campbell, with some assorted pilfering from old movies (The Searchers, The Hidden Fortress, and even Triumph of the Will.) The guy is a genius - a genius at taking your money. He'll keep adding crap and you'll keep buying the platitudes and cliches, and even better, passing them on to your kids. In my experience I find that these films tend to appeal to individuals who are stuck at an early stage of emotional development. Since unfortunately that includes a lot of people, this shrewdly ensures their success.PS: Just kidding - like everyone else I love these movies!"
2,The profile of the people who like the new versions,"little brats who grew up in a fake world, buying fake music (like Britney Spears, and Nsync), watching fake movie stars (like Jennifer lopez, and Lidsey Lohan), and growing up with a fake president (George W. Bush).It's no surprise that this generation is able to tolerate the new ""fake"" versions. Not only has this generation been brainwashed to love ""fake"", but they also get bored very easily. They cant be happy surfing the net, unless they are talking on their instant messenger. They cant be happy taking a walk down the street, unless they are talking on the cell phone. Im sure the original version of star wars must seem very boring to a generation raised on Barney the Dinosaur. That's why Lucas added Barney (A.K.A. Jar, Jar, Binks) to his films."
3,Great Release of the Re-Released Version,"This review is over the September 16, 2011 Blu-ray release (the box with vader's head covered in scenes from the movies). At the moment this is the only release of episodes 4-6 on blu-ray (the 1-6 is basically the same release). NOTE THAT THIS VERSION DOES NOT HAVE THE THEATRICAL RELEASE.That All Caps aside, this is an excellent release.PROS- The blu-ray quality is excellent- 3 disc set, in a small compact form- Separate from episodes 1-3CONS- Doesn't contain the theatrical release- blu-ray quality means that the CGI add-ons are easy to spot and look pretty bad IMO (even a person watching the series for the first time can tell these aren't suppose to be there)- CheapNote: if you want the Theatrical Release (at the point of this review) you either need to get the old VHS or the November 4, 2008 DVD release (has vader and luke clashing with lightsabers, lots of blue, with vader's helm in the background)Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Theatrical Edition)"
2,"Throw Us Longtime Fans a Bone, Georgie Boy!","As a lover of film history, you would think that Lucas would want to preserve the original versions of his classic trilogy on DVD, but he seems determined to try to re-write history by flooding the market with still more copies of his monkeyed-with versions. <sigh!> Just give us back the originals, George! Pronto, please."
1,"I know the divorce hurt George, but really?","Look I understand if she's still getting money off the original trilogy, but I'm sure you can find a work around so you can keep every penny of profit. Use the force and release the original versions, we don't need any more CGI we just need the real deal that a lot of us on here stood in line to see when we were kids."
1,We don't want your remastered garbage Lucas,"Dear Lucas,We don't want this remastered garbage. Everything you've done since the originals has ruined these movies. Give the fans the original version they've been asking for. Show some respect for the fans that made them successful and are the reason for all of your wealth. You wouldn't be anything without your fans, and the unedited versions will out sell any altered version you create. It's not like we're asking you to change the movies, we're asking you to NOT change them. For the love of god, just leave it alone already. You've become a mockery in the film industry, and unless you want that to be your lasting impression in Hollywood, I suggest you change your ways.Regards,Mike"
1,HELP! Clarification needed,"About half the reviewers here claim that these are *not* the original versions of the films.The rest claim that the ""original versions"" in this set are, in fact, the original versions.Some reviewers claim that the sound is only Dolby Digital, while the box pictured above has THX right on it.What gives? Which is it?Next poster, please address this.Thanks!"
4,"Finally on DVD, quality great, still would like original ver","This just in: A new version of Casablanca is coming out because Warner Brothers didn't get a chance to make the movie they originally wanted. New scenes will be amazing, even if they are stupid and have nothing to do with the movie at all.Ok, just kidding. But I have to admit that I belong to the camp that would like to have the original version of the films, without all of the extra scenes that have been added along the way. Especially annoying to me is the Jabba scene in IV, which should have just been one of those ""deleted extras."" And of course VI ends with a whole new sequence, and the Ewok celebration music is gone. But even with the minor and major changes, the sound and video improvements are as good as any DVD set ever released. And since there are no other versions available at this time (hint hint) we're stuck with this one."
1,These are different movies,"How many changes can you put into a movie before you must declare it a different movie altogether? And if all the changes make the movie worse off than before, and alienate the entire fan-base, why bother? These are not, unfortunately, hypothetical questions, thanks to Mr. Lucas. The original Star Wars movies were cinema history, changing them is like adding lipstick to the Mona Lisa because it's the style nowadays. You'd be changing an integral part of something that people liked very much in its original form..."
1,Greedo shooting first should be removed.,"Having Greedo shott first completely changes the character of Han Solo; before, he was essentially a rough around the edges mercenary along with his transporting, and his personality was shown through when he had zero issues with killing Greedo, and then flipping the barkeep a coin for the 'mess', as if he's just spilled his drink.And should we believe that a bounty hunter like Greedo could even miss at that range, by that much?If we had all seen Greedo shoot first, we would have had a different, unfortunately softer, view of Han.That, dear Amazon reviewer, is why we care if Greedo shoots first."
2,Nothing new,"If you have the DVDs don't buy this, it looks exactly the same as the DVDs, it doesn't como with any extras or anything that make it worth, not even the box is special."
1,What's so hard about releasing two versions?,"I would love to buy a BR set with the original, as seen in theatres, and just clean it up like any other br dvd. After that go ahead and go cgi crazy, just make sure I don't have to buy a bootl... unauthorized copy to get the orig. on br dvd."
1,1 Star Rebellion Against Cinematic Tyranny,"I find all of these 1-star reviews almost moving, not because I hate Star Wars but because I love it and don't wish to see it eternally marred by exclusive special edition releases. Cosmic balance won't be restored until the untampered originals are given a proper release. I for one am boycotting these.ETA: Amazon has apparently tampered with the reviews so that they reflect positively on the Blu-Ray set when only a few days ago it averaged a 2-star rating. They appear to have tacked on reviews for previous Star Wars releases which sadly misrepresents consumer sentiment."
1,This trilogy IS NOT the Star Wars movies you know and love.,"I think the appearence of the DVD version is very Good. The CGI has added a enhanced atmosphere and has added greatly to the visuals of this trilogy. What I can't understand nor want to, is the fact that Lucas has changed parts of these movies for the WORSE ! There are at least five or six addtions/changes made from the original versions that make this trilogy embarrissing to watch. The one change I really do not understand is the end of ROTJ. Why did Lucas remove the fun and triumphant Ewok victory song for the lame and cold feeling classical peice. To me the end of the series is ruined by that change. When I have children that are old enough to watch these movies I am going to have to dig out the old VHS versions for them to watch. This trilogy IS NOT the Star Wars movies you know and love. This trilogy is a edited version of the orginal story and it is painfull to watch. Avoid this collection at all costs....."
5,At least the first 2 films are 5 stars!,"...and 'Return of the Jedi' 3 stars. Great 1970's film fare from the second greatest film decade. Star Wars kicked off movie styles and trends that may never vannish.Surely not the greastest films ever made unless your under 16 years old!'Return..' way to corporate and very greedy. I've owned these on laser discs with great enjoyment for years. Get lost part 1, 2 and 3"
4,star wars,This is truly an exceptinal film which made cinama going an adventure.The DVD edition is truly amazing and is there is big difference between the VHS version and itself.The sound quality is truly amazing the best sound quality I have witnessed.The picture quality is amazing it cannot be faltered in any way. The best buy of the year so far.
1,Still haven't gotten it!,"I ordered this DVD on November 11, 2011. It is now 12 days before Christmas and I have not received it. I have already been charged on my credit card and paid for it. It is my grandson's main present and I am so very nervous. I must say Amazon is supposed to be on it and I hope it will be resolved as soon as possible. They are putting a tracer on it and hopefully it will be found. I have ordered many things over the years and have never, ever had a problem."
1,"Nice, but wait for the Star Wars Saga DVD set","I fail to understand Lucas' motivations for releasing these on DVD now, with no doubt a year to go on the full Star Wars Saga DVD set. Unless it's all about marketing, smooching the fans' boohineys by dropping this in their midst with a cleverly placed preview of his upcoming theatrical release of Episode III. The smart thing would have been to release the original theatrical versions of these now and the full Saga next year. Lord knows, I'd certainly buy both if that were the case. But, since it isn't I guess I'll be waiting one more year..."
1,Another Sad Day for Star Wars Fans,"I agree with all the stuff from above. Where oh where are the movies I remember? Thank goodness I actually invested in a laserdic player. Too bad it is dying and you can't get a replacement.Greedo shooting first - ""Worst movie decision EVER!"""
1,"Adding stuff is fine, but changing scenes?","Don't get me wrong, it's still a good movie. However, changing scenes, adding in another actors image over another, and changing the music is just wrong. It would be nice if I could trade in this set for the Star Wars: The Classic Edition."
1,Do not support this release.,"More alterations have been done to the original movies. Please do not support this practice. Do not buy anything until Lucasfilm releases the original, unaltered movies."
5,The Best version out there,"This set contains the best versions of the film available. In 1995 Lucasfilms remastered the color and put some sharper filters on the picture as a marketing ploy to prepare the release of the horrible edited versions released in 1997. This 1995 set has NO ADDED CG, NO REVISIONS OR EXTRA FOOTAGE. This set was how it was supposed to be. Its wonderful. The only problem is, it was only released on VHS so I suggest purchasing these and transfering them to DVD before the tape quality starts to break down. Its also not widescreen but I'll live with that. Its better than seeing Hayden Christansen edited into the final scene of Return of the Jedi with the Yanni-style music edited into the background..."
1,Another Lucas failure : pre-order cancelled,Lucas hasn't produced anything good since the early 80s.This long awaited release is just another failure as no theatrical versions are available.Lucas spends a lot of time and money making the original trilogy as awful as the prequels and he almost succeeded.R.I.P. Star Wars.
1,Han Will Always Shoot First - Lose New Hope Jabba,"I actually enjoy all the little backround additions GL added into the trilogy, but I just can't get by some of the major changes like Greedo Shooting first and Introducing Jabba in Star Wars.Greedo shooting first I shouldn't even have to explain.CG Jabba looks technically terrible, also a bit wimpy (seems to be getting pushed around by Han) and the build up to a great menacing creature is lost by showing him in the 1st movie.I know I can't pick and choose what to leave in and what to take out, so I would prefer to have the original movies I saw as a kid and that is where my money will go if they are ever released. If not, so be it.GL can do whatever he wants, but I personally will not be buying this on Blu Ray."
1,Boycott Lucas,"I doubt anyone will listen, but here goes. I grew up on Star Wars. To me, this is sacred ground we're walking on here and Lucas is destroying it. I don't want to see Han shoot first, I don't want Jabba in the first movie, and I don't want CGI in the ""classic"" trilogy. You can't go back and repaint the mona lisa to make it better, why would you do this to such a classic piece of modern mythology. The worst part is this dvd doesn't even say SPECIAL EDITION on it. He's trying to erase all mention that an original even existed. Until Lucas wises up and releases the real version. I won't buy a single product from lucasfilm, which includes a ticket to the crapfest that Ep III is sure to be. I urge anyone who cares about classic star wars to do the same. Vote with your wallets and Lucas will have to listen."
1,It will play well in Lucas's living room...,"The revisions Lucas made to the original Star Wars trilogy for the Special Editions remain cheezy and degrading. There is no question that these changes will appear just as corny in DVD format as they did in VHS not to mention on the big screen.From Greedo's lack of point blank marksmanship to Luke's suicide Tarzan yell as he plummets down the shaft of Cloud City, these revisions effortlessly turn Sci Fi classics into student film comedies.I find it infuriating that Lucas has refused to listen to the outcry from Star Wars fans for the past 5 years to include the original versions on the DVD. Where would these films be without the people who paid cash to go see them 20 times back in the 70's and 80's?Keep your S.E. version, George. I'm not buying. Just know that to many Star Wars fans, the ""S"" does not refer to the word ""Special""."
2,Originals please,"The amount to which George Lucas sucks in damaging his own trilogy is unfathomable. His ego must be enormous. To change the films over and over AND totally ""disappear"" the originals is an act of breathtaking megalomania. Change some fine, but let the originals also be sold. Not to mention the prequels just plain stink. He should be embarassed and go into hiding."
1,I want my money back!,"I can't believe he did it! He RUINED the original series! Hayden Christiensen's head on Sebastian Shaw's body? It was AWFUL! If the actor was still alive he should sue George Lucas. Naboo has now been added to the closing scenes of Jedi?! Perhaps Lucas would now like to ""re-do"" Breakfast at Tiffany's, but put Pacino's head on Peck's body? Save your money and buy a used and very old copy of the originals. Someday perhaps I will be able to buy the original films... unscarred."
1,Can't review it WITHOUT THE DVDs!,"I ordered this on Dec. 16th. It mailed out on Dec.21st and that is the last time UPS shows any tracking for it. As of today, Dec. 26th, it still shows an ON TIME DELIVERY for DEC. 23 or 24, 2004! This was my son's biggest Christmas present from us. I knew by Thursday something was wrong when the tracking had stopped. An email to Amazon assured me that it was one time - yeah right. If someone had looked at the UPS tracking for it, maybe they would have noticed that the package seemed to vanish. Calls to UPS - no good either.I wish I could get a phone number for Amazon to talk to customer service. I can only find email contact - that has not helped me yet.Last purchase here."
3,No spanish subs? AGH!,So much time waiting... so much money invested... and they only give us a spanish dub version??? And just the NEW version? That sucks. Spanish subtitles are a MUST!
5,IN DEFENSE OF GEORGE LUCAS AND THE SP EDITION,"We are fortunate to be offered this brilliant set at all. I would like a copy of the original versions as a historical piece, but all things taken into account I feel that The Special Editions are superior visually. For instance the matte lines from the analogue age are gone. You must admit that the additions of the sunset view windows on Cloud city are stunning.These are Georges' movies and any improvements he wants to make are welcome. He is the creator and he wants to use better technology to upgrade his visuals to keep them from looking dated, and to make it closer to the vision he had for it in the first place. He does not wish to have the older versions shown to a new generation of people that would need to be told that the effects were good for their time. Accept it for what it is: A masterpiece. If we want creative control then we must first create something of our own."
5,Why is everyone bitching about this?,"It wasn't even bad. The sound was decent and all the changes were minor. If you dont like this blu ray version, buy the VHS version. GL is an artist, let him have his creativity."
2,leave well enough alone,"These ""bonus"" scenes and tinkering by george totally disrupt the flow of the movies. I got more and more angry as I watched the movies culminating in the celebration scene at the end of Jedi. In my opinion the changes ruin the movies. Thats all that needs to be said."
2,Star wars Trilogy,I am a Huge star wars fan and bought these DVD's to start sharing them with my 2 year old son. I was excited that this set had both the original and the newer version of episodes 4-6 that lucas screwed up by adding more scenes. I was really disappointed that the original versions were only 1/3 the size of the picture on my TV and extremely poor quality. My VHS copies of these movies were much better quality than these DVD's. The original versions were obviously after thoughts to try and get people like me to by the set with the newer versions.
2,Not as advertised,"Its been posted several times, but there seems to be a mistake in Amazon or with the seller. I was very diligent in making sure I was buying a box set that contained the original versions of the film ... even had the right picture on the front. However, what arrived was the box set with the Darth Vadar mask on it (which wasn't the same as what was pictured when I purchased) of the digital updates. My son had opened the package and was watching them before I even got home and realized the mistake. Disappointed."
4,At least it's easier to skip scenes on DVD.,"My favorite trilogy is coming to DVD...sort of. I prefer the originals, but at least I can skip anything annoying easier with DVD.I liked the new Tattoine stuff, Bespin, the extra Wampa footage, and seeing Boba Fett in the spaceport. (minus the stepping over the tail, which I'm hoping he fixes)In fact, I liked almost all of the added goodies in the ""special editions"" except for the Greedo shoots first, the Jabba's palace R+B musical number, and the newer Ewok celebration. I haven't watched them since they were in theatres, so I can't remember any other scenes that felt wrong.It just pissed me off that so much was added, yet the Rancor scene and a few scenes aboard the ships still look really blue screened! If these are fixed, I will be a relatively happy camper.Now, what's this about adding even more new stuff like that Backstreet Boy into the originals? Eegads!"
1,HELLO?!?!,"I think Lucas has lost touch with his fan base. There needs to be a choice between ""Original"" or ""Special"" included in this release. Like Speilberg did with E.T. - include BOTH versions. DUH!"
1,'Meh' with some extra 'meh' sprinked on top,"It's the 2004 release--with all the 2004 release problems--in slightly higher resolution...with NEW problems. Yay. Thanks, George. :( I'll stick with my old VHS tapes, I guess."
4,Problem With Disc ANH,"Like many of you, I am enjoying these DVD's with the enhanced sound and video. I do not particularily like the added scenes in ANH--Jabba and Greedo especially. However, ""Star Wars"" is ""Star Wars"" and they are still great movies. I had some problems with the disc on ANH--it kept stopping and skipping. I don't think the problem was with my DVD player because this has never happened with new discs. I took the set back to the store I bought it and swapped it. Anyone else have the same problems?I expected more out of the special features disc. Guess I am spoiled by Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy box sets. Enjoy!"
1,Is this some kind of sick JOKE?????,"Lucas! You glutton for more money? What is this you're trying to pull? The only people that would fall for this are idiotic numbskulls screaming 'WE'RE STAR WARS FANS!!!!""There is NOTHING new in this set. No bonus Discs! No commentaries! NOTHING!!! This isn't about giving fans another chance to buy the OT. This is just a scam..which of course most Star Wars Nerds will fall victims to it."
1,Screwed by George Lucas,"This is another re-release of Lucas' directors' cut, now with even more changes than last go 'round. I don't want a paste in of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi, I want to see what I saw in the theaters! We'll have to wait for Lucas to die to see the real movies we saw in the theaters. Would I mind the extra footage if it were optional? No, of course not. But with today's DVD technology, the USER should get to decide whether or not to view the original theatrical releases vs. the director's cut. Bad form!"
1,Is Star Wars Original?,"No, no, no. He ripped off Dune and all those other great Sci fi and fantasy books.A finger to Star Wars!"
2,Star Wars,I don't really like star wars that much.It has tons of action wich is cool but they are kind of weird and I don't like the charecters that much.The 1st movie is 4 stars out of 5 The secon and 3rd were probally both 2 or 3 stars.
2,Nothing compared to the prequels,"After seeing the prequels i was pretty exicited to see the rest of the story so I bought the trilogy set. Quite dissapointing. The old movies are nothing compared to the prequels as regards the special effects which ofcourse is to be expected. But I must say the acting in these movies is much better. The last scene in episode VI with Hayden Christensen is a nice touch. But the first two movies are a bit slow and they tend to drag a little. I would not recommend this series unless you want some prehistoric special effects, average acting and some humour or if you want to complete your star wars collection like me. The music ofcourse is classic John Williams."
4,Whats up with all this widescreen,"I mean it dosen't make sense at all for us lovers of fullscreen..First of all Attack of the clones came out with both options either wide screen or full screen which is how it should now be adopted.Most movies now have the full screen version on one side and the wide screen version on the other, perfect,This accomodates everyone.What totaly perplexes me is George lucas (The True King of the film indutry) released the Attack of the Clones along with all of the Indiana Jone's trilogy as optional wide screen format/or full screen.But now I here the original Star Wars trilogy is offered only in wide screen.Whats up with this. Is this a technical thing.If someone from either Amazon/Fox or lucas film could exsplain to me why we are not offered the specific version we want (full/wide)It would be gratfully appreciated and end alot of debate I have had with others.Thanks p.s please excuse me if the original trilogy is optionalre:full/wide formatsJohn M, (...)"
5,forceful,it was great. i had a small problem disk 5 but over all everything i wanted and more. thank you.
5,Excellent,Nothing is better than the original trilogy. Can't say any thing else about it. It stands alone as a great.
4,Good quality but...,"9/21/11: Just finished viewing Episode 4 and it's almost as good as when I saw it in the theater way back when. The picture quality was great, sound is disappointing to me, either the music & effects are too loud or dialog is too quiet. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume. My MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT was that this was not the item I expected. I understood that I was ordering the Blu-Ray version of the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE and this ain't it. This is the version Lucas ""tweaked"" by adding the extra bits that don't thrill me. I'm keeping it, but I'm somewhat disappointed. Thank heavens nobody messed with my copies of ""Forbidden Planet"" & ""War of the Worlds"" (1950's version- yeah, I know it doesn't really follow the book, but I'm talking about theatrical releases and OCD directors). So, even if life's not perfect, it's still a good story-- but but I'm done with Star Wars editions."
2,It killed me!,"Ok, wow, I just finished watching my brand new set of DVDs. I was horrified to see the Anakin change in Jedi, but after a little while, I realize it's not the end of the world. All I really wanted was to see the deleted/altered scenes. They could have squeezed them in anywhere. I hate the 1997 ending of Jedi and I really wish they had taken out the Jabba/Han scene because Jabba looks so fake. All I wanted was to see the original ending because it's virtually impossible to find these days. Though I will treasure my new dvds, they could have been so much more than they were. If you are a true Star Wars fan, I would reccommend renting these and waiting a year till Lucasfilm gets it right and releases either the original movies to dvds or a set of dvds that allows you to watch the beloved scenes from the original movies that have been hacked to pieces with ""better technology."""
2,HAN SHOOTS FIRST!,"If you don't understand the immense importance of that half-second event, then you aren't into Star Wars for the right reason. To you, it's just a movie. Fine. Take your ""movie"" and enjoy it. But to those who aren't so easily sedated, whose standards aren't so low, who want to embrace every ounce of the true storyline and the true essences of the characters, it is blasphemy to alter it.Completely neutering Han Solo's personality into a full-blown ""good guy"" who only fires when fired upon is just wrong.It's candifying the story so kids don't get the impression that it's cool to shoot first. George Lucas has wimped out, and as evident in the newest films is trying to turn this series even more into children's entertainment, which has irretrievably damaged the entire experience.I have my original videos and I'll be happy to stick with them, thank you very much."
1,"Why, George Why?","I was disappointed, like many were. Why George, why could you not find it in your big head to release two box sets. How about a "" Directors Cut"" which is what you presented us with this time around. And the the "" Original Theatrical Production"". Does this make sense to you George. Don't you get it we liked them the way they were. Your ego should be left out of our memories. Please give it some thought. Please give us what we want. Thank you."
5,Can't say anything bad about Star Wars,This edition is terrific I think. I guess if I knew every second of each movie maybe I would be more critical. As far as I can remember I have always enjoyed these movies. My kids just recently watched them and are totally enthralled. I guess it was a little weird to see some of the newer characters thrown in this trilogy but not something that ruins the whole movie.
2,"for format, not the movies","Why would anybody watch these movies on full screen rather than widescreen? There's a lot more image in the widescreen versions. If you don't have a widescreen TV, watch the widescreen version on your computer. Don't sacrifice your viewing experience. Also, the bonus disc is worth getting, which this set doesn't have."
2,Boycott The Special Edition!,"I will NEVER pay money for the Star Wars trilogy on DVD, as long as the words Special Edition are included. George Lucas, god bless him, turned what were once phenomonal films into bantha fodder when he reworked these icons of Americana. And the first two are VERY tolerable, but the way that Return of the Jedi was turned into a cartoon essentially, causes me to VOW NEVER to give money for something that is completely unnecessary and unwanted. Boycott the Special Edition DVD's! Soon enough Lucasfilm will see that it's entire audience isn't 4 years old and make amends for their travesty."
1,Why do we have to suffer with another crappy VHS transfer?,"I now own 2 versions of the trilogy on VHS and have no intention of buying this one, since I recently bought a DVD player. Let me tell you, as anyone else will, that VHS is a waste of time after having experienced DVD. So, Mr. Lucas, kindly cut the crap and get this out on DVD ASAP. We loyal fans are rapidly losing patience, and are unwilling to shell out $30 for 10 minutes worth of behind-the-scenes on Ep 2."
1,Don't bother,"If you don't have a copy of the original movies either on Laserdisc or VHS, you're better off with your memories than with these wretched, corrupted versions"
3,"Ruined by the increasingly amount of new ""features""","So here's the thing:What most people don't realize, is that the original triogy already HAVE been (somewhat at least) restored. I own the Collector's Edition box set for laserdisc from 1993. Every frame of film was chemically cleaned for that one, and the sound remastered as well.The irony is is course, when the original trilogy was added to the DVD release a few years past, this what NOT the versions used, but something that looked like it came straight from a VHS tape.So all they need to do is to scan these prints and put them on a blu ray, because the more I read about the new 'aditions' to the movies, the more i cringe..."
3,Still star wars but...,Just does not have the same feel as the original theatrical release but its nice to have on blu ray.
4,No regrets here,"A little disappointed with some of the remastered scenes, but other than that it was great. Don't know if Blu-ray made a HUGE difference, but great value on Amazon, and I'm glad I have the disks.As for the actual movie, I don't think I really have to go into a review on Star Wars. If you are not familiar with the series, then do yourself a favor and buy these with one-day shipping."
5,Save the best set for last.,This set is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Not only does it have the special edition Star Wars it also has a bonus disc with the original theatrical versions. You can't get a set much better then this. Thanks George Lucas for giving us what we want!
5,Star Wars Trilogy,INCREDIBLE! Disk 2 of each film has the original unaltered movies in widescreen. The only other place you could find that is on laser disk or if you saw a film print in theaters. Hell of a deal and loop hole!
3,It will have to do...,"What can I say? Hayden Christensen should not be in this collection (much less movies in general). These are classic films and they should be given the respect they deserve.I kind of enjoyed the updated special effects but I can't abide having scenes redone. Oh sure, you can replace the washwoman with the emperor but tacking Hayden in place of the original Anakin is just plain wrong. I mean, seriously, how many Star Wars movies can he ruin?I'd like to see these movies released as they were originally screened. That's what you do with classics."
1,garbage,"I was all excited about this product untill I realized that it was the ""Special Edition"" Yeah thanks for putting that on the box by the way.... I want the Originals with just the color clean up of the films... BEWARE this is NOT the originals."
1,Nope...,"Not until the original theatrical editions are restored and released will I spend another dollar on Star Wars films. If viewers want these films, please purchase them; but for the rest of us, we will continue to wait."
1,Don't be swindled,"Many great films of the world are treated to definitive collections by companies like Criterion. Given the scale and global impact of Star Wars, it seems like with the advent of Blu Ray now is the time for Lucasfilm and Fox to release a Star Wars set on par with what Peter Jackson did for Lord of the Rings.Unfortunately, this is not the case. As with previous releases, little care or work at all has gone into the new BR releases. Not only the actors, but the creators of Star Wars act like they're tired of/embarrassed of/sick of Star Wars, and can't even find the time to do proper commentary tracks.Save your money. These films were never meant for HD or the home theatre anyway."
1,Never tell me the odds,"The changes sicken me, so it's great to see so many other people are going to boycott this crap. I know I'm not buying anything with Jar-jar or kid Anakin again. Best case scenario would be that ol' George is embarrassed by pitifully low sales of his blu ray masterpiece, and he decides to do what he did before and release another set later with the originals. It could happen. Maybe he'll even spiff 'em up this time instead of giving us that headache-inducing, blurry transfer. After all, it's blu ray. Come on, George. Is that too much to ask?"
1,Boooo.,"George, these movies are nearly a decade older than I am--and yet I loved the original versions so much I had star wars pajamas and all the toys I could convince my parents to buy. Now, instead of bringing back that awesomeness we get to see a wierd CGI alien lady sing and dance awkwardly in Jabba the Hut's palace. Because that's what I want to spend $50 dollars on. Wait. No I don't. I read a review once that I'm starting to believe more and more these days. It said that Star Wars was great in spite of Lucas, not because of him. The reason the movies don't get better as your go IV, V, VI, I, II, III instead they get worse, is because after the initial sucess of the first movie or two, the studios have gave George so much 'artistic license' that he was free to make crappier and wierder movies every time. Hence the ewoks, probably least favorite thing out of the original three. Hence that blabber thing in Episode I. Anyway, not going to be buying this one."
1,George Lucas is an ignorant man.,"The stupidest argument I hear from pro-special edition people is that George Lucas couldn't stand the originals and wanted to make them how he wanted them, that's just rediculous, many artists hate what is generally considered their best work, Anthony Burgess never understood why people liked 'A Clockwork Orange' so much, he made it just to pay the bills, Tchaikovsky despised 'The Nutcracker Suite', and John Lennon generally disliked everything the Beatles did. I originally didn't mind the special editions, I didn't like them, but I figured I didn't have to watch them, I still had the old ones, but now George Lucas is trying to rewrite history and make it seem like the originals never existed. When you release a work of art, it then belongs to the public, when you take it away, it's like stealing, George Lucas stole the Star Wars Trilogy from us."
1,What was that?!?!?!?,"This is NOT the original trilogy! Sure the picture quality is great, but what movie was that? It wasn't Star Wars! Who re-mixed the audio? My Grandmother? Lucas has lost his mind! If you want the REAL Star Wars, please visit ORIGINALTRILOGY.COM"
1,Will wait as long as it takes for the REAL movie.,"My movie collection will remain incomplete until I can put the original version of Star Wars in there. I still have my VHS version and I will keep my VCR around as long as it takes. I'm sure SOME day G Luc will give the millions of Star Wars fans the movie they want, but until then he gets none of my money."
2,"Listen to the fans, George","These are NOT, I repeat, NOT the original films released on DVD. This is the same Special Edition that disappointed you in the 90's, now with the even bigger slap of adding young Anakin (Hayden Christensen) to the Jedi Spirits scene at the end of ROTJ (sorry, Obi(Ewan). For whatever reason you're still old!). MR LUCAS, WE ARE YOUR DIE HARD FANS! WE LOVE THESE MOVIES! PLEASE GIVE US WHAT WE WANT - THE PURE, UNADULTERATED, ORIGINAL STAR WARS TRILOGY THAT MADE US THE HOPELESS GEEKS WE ARE TODAY! We don't want the version with the poorly aiming Greedo, or with the Grimace look-alike Jabba who deigns to come a-groveling at Docking Bay 94 and lets Han walk on him like a fool (like any menacing gangster would stoop so low). Please give us what we want, and believe me, you can market it any way you like (in other words, charge as much as you want) and the original hardcore fans will pay! Call it the Ultimate Whiners Edition for all we care! Just give it to us, please!!"
1,"""This is not the movie you're looking for. Move along.""","Negative Review...Negative Review. What can I say that hasn't been said before?Return of the Jedi ending with Hayden- That's not his head posted on the original body. Look Closely: That's the costume that MacGregor wore for Episode III. One was fitted for Hayden and Hayden was filmed. Then the original actor for the ending was erased, and Hayden inserted.If you want a good Special Edition, listen to the Radio versions or read the Radio scriptbooks. :thumbsup:"
3,the real problem lies in the evolution of the films,"While sensitive to the critical comments I have read, I would add that for me, the most grievous flaw lies in how the series ended, with the putative ""redemption"" of Vader. The problem is that in the earlier episode illustrating Vader's transformation to evil, he is depicted as personally responsible for mass murder, in the killing of the Jedi. In this context, it seems a profound moral flaw in Lucas' story line that someone at that level of evil should be considered capable of being redeemed at the end even he turned to cast his boss the Emperor into hell. Lucas lost me at that and, as someone who was quite transfixed by the first and closely watched them to the end, this was far more disappointing than the revisionist ""Noo"" that seems to have crept into these final revisions. That being said, I still have my laserdiscs for the originals of the original trilogy and am purchasing the blu rays for the system I have now."
4,"Four Stars for content, Three Stars for widscreen transfer",What more can possibly be said about the original Star Wars Trilogy....George Lucas in his prime...as well as everyone else.The Widescreen version of this package has fair transfers...but I'm just probably spoiled from DVD.
3,Not as good as the originals,"I don't mind the Special Editions, but I'd prefer the originals. The only thing the REALLY bothers me is that Greedo now shoots first. That not only changes the scene (not too mention how poorly edited it was), but also dimishes Han's character as well."
3,No es la mejor opción para los fanáticos latinos,"El box es completísimo, incluyendo la versión original de cine y la remasterizada de cada película.El único problema para los fanáticos de latinoamérica es que no traen subtítulos en español. La versión original trae audio español penínsular y la remasterizada trae un audio español latino donde Darth Vader habla de corrido y es aún más plano que el audio español peninsular.Por otro lado, si usted es angloparlante o entiende inglés, es 100% recomendable."
4,A classic trilogy with an added bonus,"Well, mostly I was just glad they re-released the special edition because I missed out the last time it was available. The sneak peak at Episode II was cool as it gives a glimpse into the future of the prequel trilogy. However, what the heck is the big deal with not releasing the DVD of the original trilogy? Why just a vhs version? Really this is just a marketing ploy to get suckers like me to buy the trilogy who missed out the first time this was available. That's the only real reason why I don't give this 5 stars. It's story is timeless and lets face it- there is nothing cooler than the original debut ""A New Hope""- it still holds it's own after more than 20 years and that is why it is still loved and embraced by millions."
3,"Not original, but not horrible.","Yes I agree with the first reveiwer when I say this is not the best version available. I am constantly angered how this has become the ""ultimate"" edition. I am perhaps the only young fan who still respects the originals. Because in a way I did grow up with them by first watching the Pre-special editions,which I am very fortuanate to own. Once I went to a friends house and we watched STARWARS on the special edition versions and I remember commenting,""I thought Han Shot First"", and my friends and millions of other ""younglings"" have been ""brainwashed"" with the ""modified"" versions.I have heard rumuors that he will release a final version with even more changes! Mr.Lucas for next release please include the originals and the modified editions. Go Sebastian,Revil,and the original voice of Boba Fett!"
1,Star Wars re-release with Episode II preview insults fans,"The re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy on VHS for the third (or is it fourth) time is an affront to fans. This newest release appears to offer nothing new but a trailer to Episode II. As fans eagerly await the DVD release, Lucasfilm has ignored their wishes, but instead has insulted fans by asking them to spend even more money on VHS tapes that will be replaced when the eventual DVD release is distributed. Shame on George Lucas!"
1,Insulting,"I remember the first time I watched the special edtition star wars movies. I didn't really see anything that made them better. Then I got to the return of the jedi. When that fuzzball thing started singing and dancing across the screen, I wanted to throw up. If George Lucas wants to turn the original star wars trilogy into musicals for children I have no problem with that. He created the movies, he has every right to do so. But for him to say, I'm ruining the star wars movies, and I'm going to force everyone to watch these abominations, is outrageous. This basically means he made it so everyone who doesn't enjoy watching pure crap, won't every buy his movies again. It's sad but, whatever, I'm sure there will be plenty of science fiction movies out there that aren't directed towards 5 year olds. I would suggest looking into those instead of this mockery of a good trilogy."
1,Not buying it.,"This isn't really a review so much as a mini-proclamation. I won't be buying this DVD set. I love the original trilogy and, for me, the running changes add nothing to my enjoyment of it. In fact, they stick out so much that I find I cannot watch the film for being distracted by the changes. So, buy it if you must. Heck, I even hope some of you enjoy it. Me? I won't drop another dime into the Lucas Film vault. Not until the original Original Trilogy, warts and all, is released."
1,"No thank you, Lucas and thanks reviewers","No, Lucas, I ain't buying this garbage. you've been going downhill since Jedi, face it.Thank you reviewers for pointing out the ""lovely"" additions, otherwise I might have been fooled that these were the ""originals.""And yes, I am one of those die hards who saw the first star wars (that is, episode IV), in the theater, though I was only four at the time... but so what?That doesn't mean I'm an inflexible geek or loser. I'm older with refined tastes and know what a good movie is, and Lucas makes garbage now, and has corrupted his original movies with more garbage. I just don't see and praise every piece of hollywood garbage out there.If you haven't yet, try to find the hilarious article about Jar jar in The Return of the King on B-spot. It's right on target as to the lameness of Lucas and his current work...-Alan (NYC) maker of ""Continuity Wars"""
2,This Is Not the Original Trilogy.,"This is not Star Wars: The Original Trilogy. It is a derivative work, with most of the original material, but you will also encounter different visual and audio effects, music, script, and actors. Certain character arcs, dramatic beats, and major story points have been altered. Two of the films were modified without the director's control or assent. See my review ofStar Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray] for further discussion.I give this set one extra star because it is not weighted down by the lugubrious prequels. The extra star should not be construed as advice that you purchase this set.BTW, Amazon seems to have conflated this review with various other Star Wars reviews. I don't know how they manage to sell people the things they click on, yet mix the reviews up so badly. Anyway, in case you still can't tell, this is for the 2011 Blu-ray Original Trilogy box set."
1,WHY?,"Avoid buying this collectors edition. Why you ask. Well, its not the effects, they're great. Its not the sound, that's magnificant. It's the ""special"" editing they've done. WHY does Greedo shoot the wall (not leaving a mark mind you) THEN Han shoots him? WHY WHY WHY. It's done again in another scene, but I can't explain because I nearly threw up. How dare you CHANGE the movie like that. Han is a scoundrel, not a ""self-defencer"". Avoid it, like the plague!"
1,Beware of Counterfeit Star Wars movies!!!,"How can you tell if you are buying an authentic Star Wars movie?*Does Han Solo shoot Greedo first? Authentic!*Does Darth Vader yell ""Noooooo!""? Fake!*Do crappy CGI cartoon characters interrupt the story every 20 seconds? Fake!There are many other ways to tell if you are wasting money on a counterfeit release of Star Wars. Use Google to learn more!"
1,Lucas can kiss my poodoo,"I love the original unedited Star Wars and wouldn't mind buying their DVDs but there's no way I'll buy the SE Sar Wars DVDs. After seeing Episode 1 and 2, I'm afraid to see what 3 will look like."
1,You Will Not Get What You're Expecting,"I have wanted star wars on blu-ray for as long as blu-ray has been in existence, but as the release date gets closer it has become clear that this is not the original star wars trilogy. Do a google search on star wars blu-ray changes and you will see that this is a heavily modified version of the films."
5,Star Wars,"I Rember watching it on the big screen and at the end everyone stood up and applauded at the end of the movie it was just as good the second time around, disk and box was in great shape delivery was great Thank You."
1,???High Yield???,"Ordered product beginning of February for home use. When I received and installed a couple of the print nozzles were not working according to the test page, but it was not noticeable printing documents. I print sunday school documents for 5 students, so it surprised me that after about 60 documents, the cartridge is out of ink. I suspect this cartridge must have been on the shelf for a while. It's back to Walmart for me for my cartridges."
2,Not OEM,"The cartridge I ordered was marked as ""remanufactured"". The description leads you to believe these are OEM cartridges. Haven't installed it in my machine yet, but I'm hoping it is up to par."
1,Beware,"Beware of ordering from this seller. I ordered this cartridge from them the beginning of March. It was supposed to be ""new from the manufacturer....wrong!!!! It was in the old box that Lexmark used and inside the box was a clear plastic bage that was stapled together, not the silver bag it should have been in. Then, instead of the factory seal there was a piece of scotch tape at the bottom. The ink had clearly been leaking. I ordered a new on directly from Lexmark and when I compared the two, the one from Tech Supply was obviously empty when I compared the weight of the two. They did refund my money, but I will NEVER buy from them again and strongly suggest people look elsewhere."
1,Sent it back,"It was difficult to wire and didn't work properly. We purchased it because we like the design of having the buttons hidden behind a little door. Although it looks good on paper, it wasn't when up-close and personal.We went back to a Honeywell product, which is a snap to wire and use. The buttons aren't hidden, but hey, you can't have everything, and during the winter, having the thermostat work is kind of important..."
4,Princeton Review SAT Math Workout,"I thought that this book was extremely helpful in preparing for the SAT's. Having read the other reviews on this book I must disagree with some of the comments that were made. This is a review book and not meant to make up for lack of effort in previous math classes. It cannot teach you everything but I found it to be very helpful in improving my score from the PSAT's to the SAT's. For the one reviewer who thought this was the wrong book for anyone who wanted over a 650, he is wrong. I got a 620 on math PSAT's but a 740 on my math SAT's. This improvement I owe greatly to the review done with this book."
1,HORRIBLE - Filled with ambiguities and careless mistakes!,"Having found Princeton's AP books especially helpful, I was surprised to find so many egregious errors in this SAT prep. Completing the practice sets was an exercise in frustration because so many of the answers given were based on a misunderstanding of the question as stated. The author and editor must be either very careless or have some serious mental difficulties (I'm hoping for the former, for their sake). DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!! The SATs are stressful enough without having to deal with such sloppy work - some poor souls may actually be more damaged than helped by this math ""workout"". Save your money - or, better yet, try Kaplan's, Barron's, or the College Board's ""10 Real SATs""."
1,Do Not Buy!,"If you are considering preparation for the SAT, NEVER buy Princeton Review. This book contains a multitudinous amount of typos and insufficient explanations. I have had bad experience with Princeton Review. If you are shooting for higher than a 650, do not even consider this book. UGGHHH!"
1,Andiamo: Love from Italy,This product was defective. I had to send the CD back twice to Amazon. It would not play on 4 different CD players I have. I was really disappointed. We saw these singers on PB and wanted this CD and we even preordered it.
5,Dakota dining room set,My husband and I put the table and chairs together with minimal problems. Directions were not as clear as I'm used to but not to hard.
2,Does it Need to be SOO expensive?!,"The packaging I love, the smell is nice. I've been using it for little more than a week on random blemishes and it seems to do its job, but so would witch hazel, for a fraction of the COST! This is not worth the price."
4,She makes agnostura look like dishwater. I love it.,"I originally reviewed her first book 'How to Heal the Hurt by Hating'. I was impressed by her well-placed words and her blade-sharp wit. Wicked stuff. In her typical trademark style, Anita has once again written another inspirational tome. She says the sorts of things you dream of saying hours after the opportunity to say them is gone. Only she says them right away. In classic fashion she takes us down a winding, blistering road of bitterness so we can watch as she nearly loses her grip on this most acidic of styles. It's a well written journey and a must for anyone who either loved the first book or wants to know just who this Anita Liberty person is.I love everything she's written so far because I can identify with it. If there's a third book and it's focused on her life, I may not be able to follow along (The CF should take note). but you'll have to read 'How to Stay Bitter Through the Happiest Times of Your Life' to see why I say this."
3,"Cute, but flawed","The design is adorable, but unfortunately, there's a big ugly seam on the back of the ring that ruins the flow."
5,A great way to save school memories,"I love this memory book. I had to buy three so each of my children would have one. I had to look a long time to find this format - large enough to hold the class photo.The bus on the cover is made of tin, with a spot to put a small individual picture of the child each year.On the inside, there is room for the class photo and a page of fill-in the blanks ""about me"" information for each grade. For the middle and high school years the photo page is set up more like a collage.There are also pockets for each year to hold report cards and awards.I had their teachers sign the book each year and had my child write his or her signature to see how that changed.This is simple, attractive, and worth the price, I think. Especially if you are not into scrapbooking but do want to have a keepsake of their school years."
3,"great coffee, doesn't stay hot long, handle with care, the glass broke","Makes more flavorful coffee because the steel screen lets more coffee solids through. The grounds take up about an inch or so of usable space, limiting the number of cups. You will probablly get at most 2-4 American cups. Double glass walled press kept my coffee warm, not hot, for about an hour. If you have to have a coffee press, save yourself $50 and get a regular model, as the insulating properties were unimpressive. Pretty easy to clean, but as I tapped the bottom with my hand to get the grounds out, the glass shattered and impaled my hand. I'm going to get a stainless press instead of replacing the glass. The double wall replacement glass costs $30 from Bodum."
4,A realistic approach to maintaining balance in all areas,"This book was difficult for me to put down. Initially I borrowed it from the library but realized after turning down the corner of every other page because the information was so vital, so profound, so inherent to living a spiritually healthy life that this book is a must have for my own library. It is like having a conversation with a valued friend. You will find the Leveys know their stuff, and yours too! A terrific gift for the seasoned explorer of the spiritual path as well as the novice."
5,Living with Balance,"Living in Balance has been life-changing. I have desired peace and balance, however I was doing almost everything wrong to achieve it. The authors offer practical insights, exercises and factual statistics that bring everything together beautifully. My book has highlight marks and notes everywhere! I plan to read it again (and again). For the first time in my life, I feel hope that I can live a meaningful life with peace and harmony with the world!"
1,Are you mad insane,"This guy is selling it for cheap, but in return we have to pay over $2,000 for shipping I would never ever even think of buying this item from this seller. Please get out of here look for hoods from another seller. Jeez 2K for shipping! MAD CRAZY MY MAN"
3,"It's okay, but not my favorite","I like clear acrylic cutting boards to leave sitting out because they protect kitchen counters without obscuring the view of the counters; the kitchen does not look cluttered because they are sitting out on the counters.This acrylic cutting board is fine. It's a decent size, feels sturdy like it will last, and does the job. However, I'm not crazy about the finish because it doesn't look bright to me. If the board isn't clear, I want it to look bright.Also, the rubber feet means it shouldn't go in the dishwasher because eventually at least one will come off and could cause a plug up during a cycle.I'm going back to ordering only clear boards with no rubber feet or pads."
2,Great sound but way too fragile,"I loved the sound, but they fell apart in a month. The jack and wiring can't stand up to day to day use."
4,Enjoyable book,"My 3 year old son enjoys the TV show, and started asking for us to read him the stories, so I started with this one. It's a good story, about acceptance and adoption, and the illustrations are beautiful. The use of rhyme helps my son to complete sentences with me. Daniel Kirk also illustrated Chugga Chugga Choo Choo, which has been a favorite for a while!"
5,"MIssing a page, but daughter loves it otherwise!","Our little girl loves this book! But what bugs (haha) me is, it's missing the page right after the picture of them painting the egg. Can someone scan it and send it to me? I've read this book dozens of times, and I finally can't take it anymore; I have to know what they say when they paint the egg!!! :D if someone can do that, my email is crazy_ass_engineer@yahoo.com! Thanks!"
5,Miss Spiders Suny Patch Kids,My grandson is totally in love with Miss Spider Books. He carries them around with him all the time. When his dad tells him to get a book to read at bedtime (or anytime) he ALWAYS gets one of his Miss Spider Books.
2,"perhaps useful as a poor man's ""for dummies"" book on design","This book was required reading for a publication class taughtby Toor. In general, the book is extremely simple, even simplistic,and gives the reader only a cursory glance at desktop publishing, suggesting many obvious cliches and ""tried and true"" design solutions rather than training the reader's visual sense. Some of the design examples are crude and amateurish. Ironically, the book is poorly designed as well, making liberal use of overused default graphics software ""effects"" and muddy, low-resolution graphics. Very disappointing... I would suggest this book only to non-designers who do want to really learn anything about design, but are only looking for some easy answers."
3,Caution: Hole spacing requirements not compatible older predrilled doors,"I purchased three of these locks to replace existing Kwikset deadbolts (installed in 1981). The hole spacing requirement (center to center) for this Schlage electronic deadbolt is not compatible with older doors which were drilled for the Kwikset lockset and deadbolt combination. Instead of a 10 minute install, it took close to two hours per door because I had to enlarge the hole for the deadbolt to keep it from interfering with the mounting ring on my Kwikset lockset. Even after I modified it, they still touch and I could not tighten any screws until I forced the deadbolt higher. This is dumb engineering, there was no reason for the assembly to encroach on the area used by the lower handle. They obviously did not try this on any existing doors. It works find if you are drilling your own holes in a new door."
5,Great deadbolt,"This is the second keypad deadbolt I have purchased and installed and is by far the best. The other model I had (a Kwikset) used a motor to retract and extend the bolt. It used a cheapo clutch mechanism so that you could manually extend the bolt with a lever which eventually broke, rendering the lock useless. The deadbolt on this model is fully manual, so there are no motors or clutches to break. It has the added benefit of making your batteries last longer. The backlight is a nice touch as well. Installation was a snap - it uses all standard mounting dimensions, so I just had to remove the previous lock and pop this one in. And I like the fact that it is relatively compact in size. I liked it so much that I bought another for our garage door."
4,Works well,"Works great. Arrived quickly. Was as advertised. But as others have stated it is missing one screw. I had to make a trip to hardware store, for a 6 cent machine screw. But I would still recommend this lock."
5,Very convenient - no keys required!,"Now I don't have to worry weather our son left with his keys or not nor do I have to worry weather a house guest has a key or not. Very easy to install. Fits right into the place of existing locks. When we had a kitchen renovation going on for 2 months, we created a new code for the contractor. He used to come in go while we were at work. Once the project was over, I deleted the code and that's it."
5,Fantastic product!,"This is great for our family with everyone coming and going at all different times. No need to remember the ""key."" This replaced a Kwikset keyless model that failed. Found the reviews on the Kwikset were poor and this model had great reviews. This one you must manually turn it to lock it. Reviews really help. Excellent purchase and price."
2,"great product, but damaged prior","While the lock was supposed to be a new product, you could tell after opening the box that the bolt had been damaged by tool and hammer sometime in it's past. The styrofoam inside the box had been broken and retaped. I'm sure that had it been really new, it would have been a great lock. But couldn't get a replacement and had to ask for a refund instead."
3,Didn't Last Long,"I installed this product the summer of 2008 and initially it was great. Was so convenient and so glad to have it. This summer (2011) it quit working. You enter the code, it gives you a green light and you hear the click, but when you turn the lever, it does not move the deadbolt. It is like the gears (or whatever catches the deadbolt) are stripped inside. Seems like maybe some cheap parts inside have worn out and failed already. I'm very disappointed and not sure if I want to sink the money into a second one or go do a different brand."
4,Mostly good. A few things that make you go Hmmm.,"Schlage got it right with the concept of an electronic lock that requires you to physically twist the knob. Our previous electronic door lock would frequently stick when the batteries were low or the batteries would pop out of their holder, if the door was accidentally slammed shut and make the door lock inoperable. This unit uses a 9 V battery that stays securely in place and is only responsible for the electronic signal that allows you to manually unlock the door. This way the battery lasts a lot longer as well.I do have issue with the layout of the numbers. I think they are awkwardly placed depending on the code you choose. An standard 3x3 numeric type setup would have been better. Also it appears you must punch in your code to lock the door. I would think a single button lock feature would be more convenient. Perhaps I need to read the instructions more carefully."
5,Awesome product,"I got to say this thing works beyond my expectations. It's great. No need to leave a key for the kids, bug man, or maid. If someone shows up unexpected, they call me and I give them the code. Easy to delete and change. Action feels strong and durable. I've seen some negative comments about it, but mine is far under my porch and in no threat of getting wet. Looks like it could survive the weather anyway. BEST FEATURE IS THAT IT HAS NO MOTOR TO PUSH THE DEADBOLT IN THE WALL. It works by hand turning it. The most vulnerable part of this from my reasearch was the motor that drives the deadbolt into the wall. They solved that problem in this model by creating a hand turn on the front of the lock. Enter the code than turn it. Less moving parts means less to break. Also means less battery usage. I love it. Was worth the extra dollars to get a good sturdy reliable one."
4,No keys! HOORAY!,This was an easy install - the directions are great - just read 'em! Now that it has been installed for 4 weeks - really liking it a lot. Worth the price.
5,Works great if you follow instructions,This is a great lock. Very much worth the price paid. The deadbolt was easily installed and easy to operate. My 10 year old has no issues in using it. I like that you have have multiple codes so that you can create temporary codes that can be removed later. There is much convenience to be had now.
5,Very attractive alternative to a key,Bought this for a vacation rental home where I did not want the short time tenants to have a key which could be copied. Easy to change the combination for the next renter.
4,Looks good and works well. for the price!,"Good for the price. A handi-man friend of mine was able to install it, which helped the cost factor. I had a bit of a problem working it correctly at first, but learned fast and once I got the idea,I did fine! It makes the door look much better also.All in all I'm satisfied! Dolore Shields"
5,Install does not require non-standard holes in the door,"The other reviews all sound about right to me, i.e. this product is great! I love it! I just wanted to point out that when I was considering buying it I almost didn't because I rent and I didn't want to put two screw holes in my (landlord's) door. In the photo, there are two screws clearly visible in weird positions. Turns out that they are machine screws that go into a back plate held in place entirely by the normal type of screws that hold door locks together. So no worries about that. Also note that the screws are on the inside as is the battery. You don't want some tweaker to take apart your door lock to steal the 9V battery (included btw) and this lock prevents that.You can install this lock in 15 minutes pretty easily and put it back to the way it was when you move out. I'm looking forward to taking this lock with me where ever I live!"
5,"Works as advertised, great lock.",This lock is very solid and has lots of features. What I do like is that you can set it to let you turn the lock from the outside manually instead of having the batteries turn the deadbolt for you. This saves battery life.I like how the keypad lights up blue. Easy to program.
2,Arrived defective - Probably a return or refurb,"Should have known better to open the package when I could see fingerprints on the product through the plastic window. Product would only buzz a bit when trying to open/close the deadbolt. I disassembled it from the the door and same thing - it would not turn the deadbolt, only make a small buzz sound.Based on the dirty fingerprints on the product, I'm sure I received a defect return or refurb repackaged as new.Worse yet, I had to try and reassemble the old deadbolt, which had a stripped screw and now the deadbolt is not very secure.On the plus side, it did seem like a solid heavy product. But now I'm concerned on its quality and reliability.90 minutes wasted and now a trip to ship the thing back. Thanks Amazon! :("
3,depends on the weather,"this product is great... when it works. most of the time the lock works exactly as it should but other times, and i don't know excatly why yet, it doesn't. i installed the lock, which was very straight forward and easy, erased the factory combinations and entered my own. everything was perfect. the next day i went to use the lock and it wouldn't work. it had been raining but, surely i thought, this lock should be weather proof. i followed the trouble shooting instruction and even replaced the battery but nothing. aggrivated i gave up and thought tomorrow i will contact someone for help. tomorrow came and the lock worked! the lock has continued to work except when it gets a little cold. very aggrivating for i never know when it's going to work."
4,Works better than expected,"I installed two about a year ago and they have simply performed well. You don't realize how easy it is to enter and to exit and lock without use of keys until you try this. Lighted keypad is great too as both entry ways are dim. However, my primary door lock recently stopped functioning, I swapped out the batteries but in fact they were not dead. I played with the battery connectors but they appear sound. No light or power to the key pad so it cannot lock or open from outside. Will need to contact Schlage to see what other things I might check. Really want to get this back online."
4,Very nice.,"I bought a couple of these for my home and am quite happy with the way they work. Installation was a bit tricky but not bad. Read the directions thoroughly before install and be sure you have measured your door and strike plate placement as some adjusting of the strike plate from your old lock may be necessary. I had to do some movement of my strike plate. Lock is sturdy and once you get on to the system it is easy to use. Nice it lights up in the dark so you can see the numbers well when it is nighttime. PRICEY.... but, overall, I think worth it. I have recommended to my daughter so I recommend these to you. I do feel that a 5 number code rather than just 4 numbers would be good. Other than price and number of code numbers, no real negatives. Looks good on both sides of door. I recommend these for the DIY'er. Just, read the instructions first!"
1,Bad Fit,This product did not mention online that the holes in the existing door need to have a certain spacing. Mine were drilled too close and therefore did not allow room to install the product
5,Well done!,"Once I started reading Libby's STORM RUN, I could't put it down! Even though I've lived in Alaska for 33 years, Libby's dog mushing background and Iditerod experience kept me spellbound until the end.I can't wait to read it to my second graders. It will be a terrific geography lesson as well as learning about dog mushing.Libby definitely has 'true grit'."
5,A great true story by the first woman to win the Iditarod.,"In 1985, Libby Riddles became the first woman to win the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a grueling 1,100+ mile test of stamina and spirit. When an unusually severe snowstorm stopped all the other mushers in their tracks, Riddles pushed on. It was only her second time running the Iditarod, but her courage and determination brought her into Nome, Alaska ahead of the pack. In this book she recalls her experiences, briefly recounting her childhood and early life, and then describing the famous race. The writing is simple and fast-paced, but still captures the feeling of her adventure. You can feel the cutting sharpness of the wind-driven snow or see the northern lights dancing overhead. The book is also beautifully illustrated with simple but vibrant colored pencil drawings by Shannon Cartwright. This is an excellent Iditarod story for any young reader and I'd definitely recommend it."
3,Good balls for the price.,"These are good balls if you're a beginner. These are not soft nor have any particular improvement on ball striking, but they do let you feel the difference among different construction of golf balls. They're pretty solid and DEFINITELY take a good amount of whacks before you can see any damages to the outer layer."
1,Labeled Incorrectly?,"I saw this item and had to purchase it. I have a pond in my backyard that has a nice fountain. I currently have a 535GPH pump powering the spillway, but wanted more movement in the water. When I saw this item...1083GPH pump...I figured that would work just fine and dandy. The pump arrived quickly, but to my dismay, the flow was less than half of my existing 535GPH pump. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed. I emailed the company, asking about their return policy. After a couple of days, I received a response stating I would receive a full credit, minus shipping of course, upon return of the product. I immediately went down to UPS, packed it up, and shipped it off. Approximately a week and a half later, I saw the credit on my card statement.So, even though the product did not perform as advertised, the company stood behind their product. In the end, that's all that matters to me."
4,wow - great indie-pop -,"I am a big microphones fan - hadn't checked out Mirah's solo stuff before though - This album is really good - definetly apparent is Phil Elvrum's influence - but Mirah has her own style - I think her vocals are great - but most of all, the production sounds lovely - especially the second half of the album, which takes on a quieter, calmer, more somber feel - the album is a great listen - highly recomended!"
5,perfect,"We needed a new medallion to cover dry wall holes in the ceiling when we moved the kitchen chandelier. This not only fits perfectly, but it is very attractive. I have gotten many compliments on it."
2,"too smelly, too pricey","After reading all of the great reviews, and seeing a recommendation for this in one of the major fashion magazines, I was very eager to try this. SO disappointed upon receiving it--extremely thick, greasy, and so smelly that I wouldn't want it anywhere near my face! It honestly has the same smell and consistency as this goop that I used to put on my horses' hooves as a kid! I've been using Aquaphor for years, and it can be used for absolutely anything (dry/cracked skin, burns, dry lips, heal skin blemishes), it has no scent and is a fraction of the cost! I'm going to stick with that and hope that I can send the Elizabeth Arden cream back. :("
4,"Good product, but smelly","I have been using this product a long time, about 4 years.I feel this product helps my fingers with the ends of my fingers cracking open and becoming EXTREMELY sore and painfull.I am always looking for better prices on anything I order online and I found it at a different site than this one that includes shipping with the current price of $17.00"
5,Best hand moisturizer ever,This is a best hand moisturizer I've ever used. It's not greasy if you thoroughly blend it into the skin and wait for it to absorb.
2,"bad smell , greasy",I was not impressed by this product. It left my hands feeling and looking greasy and they still felt dry. I also don't like the smell. It has an industrial oil smell that isn't very pleasant. I would not recommend this product.
2,Great product - bad price,"While this is a truly wonderful product, you can purchase it at a store for the same price without paying the shipping."
2,I prefer them better behind the scenes overall,I respect Floetry for what they do as Writers&Producers Behind the scenes but as Artists in there own right I can take or leave it.the Rapping&Singing Concept is cool for a minute but after a while it loses it's flavor for me.this is a decent set but nothing blows me away.
5,Absolute Genius,"This is the first Waterboys album I have heard, over 20 years ago. I appreciate this album more today than the first time I heard it. Nothing compares to shear genius of lyrics, sweet rythms, and variety of musical styles and instruments. You need to listen more closely each time you hear it to really appreciate the talent hear. I cannot recommend this album more. I own both Fishermans Blues and This is the Sea but when it comes to sheer imaginative genius, this album tops all."
4,Excellent folk rock,"The Waterboys in their heyday, between the anthem rock period and the breakup of the band. Mike Scott returns to his roots and some of the most endearing modern Celtic folk rock ever recorded."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I got this as a gift for my daughter. First, it came in a cheap cardboard box and bag, not the promised packaging on the website. Second, the links between the flowers are so small that the necklace kinked and was hard to straighten- it would be a nightmare every time you tried to put it on. Finally, the lobster claw clasp is so tiny that it's almost impossible to open. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by- I'm surprised that Amazon, whose products I order routinely, would carry such an item, and thankful for their return policy since I returned it after seeing it within five minutes of the package delivery to my house."
2,"Pretty, but just looked cheap","I agree with the previous reviewer that it was a little hard to get unkinked and came in a tight bag that I was aghast to see such a big necklace stuffed into. However, my main problem with the necklace, that while pretty, looked like something you'd buy for $5 at Claire's and not an expensive Zina necklace. If you need a gift for a young girl it would be pretty, but it's way too expensive for what it is (even at the $99 I paid)."
4,practical,"These two things are great to make coffee with steamed milk.I love the glass because it heats fast in the microwave and has a measuring line for the milk. However, I would not recommend placing it in the dishwasher because it eventually erases the line."
3,A good frother for a limited time,"We had worked our way through 3 IKEA frothers in a year, and decided to try a better frother.Initially, this frother worked quite well.After 11 months, it seems like the contacts have trouble maintaining a circuit with the batteries and, even worse, the motor strength is drastically diminished.This unit cost 10x an IKEA frother and lasted 3x as long."
2,Third one is not the charm.,"Yup, I bought three. First one destroyed by an inquisitive toddler, second one fell to its demise and the third one never worked right in the first place. The glass pitchers all broke, too. Just by bumping with another glass or tipping over. The glass is very thin, reminiscent of the old McDonalds happy meal glasses. Maybe thinner.. Don't buy this product."
2,where's the salad dressing set?,"this is false advertising, since there is no separate ""salad dressing set"" included. am i supposed to mix olive oil in my milk frother? i don't think so. i paid top dollar to get the extra salad dressing set."
3,Assessment of Cincuenta Lecciones de exilio y desexilio,"Poignant, incisive and revealing, a revieew of perceptions and circumstances by a genial writer of Cuban-American ethnicity. Intersped there are many revelations of serious maladaptive patterns indicating failure on the part of the author to assimilate into the ""melting pot"" of americana, the source of the strength for all who have been blessed with the opportunity to live in the land of the free. Perhaps the aphorism ""Love it or Leave it"" might apply here."
3,OK,This book was OK but fairly predictable. I did finish it but the ending was not a surprise. I don't feel that it is her best book
5,REQUIRED CORSE MATERIAL,"BOUGHT this book as required for my class. Book was in excellent condition!! The book is easy to read, straight forward views..."
1,Too many mistakes,"well, it should be an excellent book but finally turns out to be a nightmare due to too many mistakes. Few files in the book can be used directly and mistakes could be found every page. Just a waste of time and energy."
2,A Cookbook with some ActiveX recipes,"This book tries to show how to 'do ActiveX' without explaining what ActiveX (or COM) is. It gives some 'recipes', but doesn't explain the gotchas. As far as recipes go, some areas that were important for my project were missing (variant and safearray manipulation, threading models) I think anyone whose serious about ActiveX programming (especially the distributed-computing part) should have some understanding of the inner-workings of COM. This book does not touch this issue at all. Another issue not touched is the structure of ATL and the OLE parts of MFC (which is hard to explain without explaining COM first). So I'd say this is book is good for someone who needs to get something out the door tomorrow, assuming that the book's 'recipes' cover all the project's needs (which is not very likely...)"
1,A very weak pump!,"It's an extremely weak pump. If you need just a bit air flow, then go for it; otherwise try to find something else. It has just 0.5 CFM, with the very low pressure (approx. 2-5 PSI). I could not use it, and ordered another compressor."
1,Chronic Boredom,"This may be one of the most boring books on the planet. On top of that, the pompous high minded prose suffers from a bad translation. ""Novel without qualities"""
2,"A clever work, but very long and boring","I agree with Linda's comments... very clever book, but very very boring... if you wanna a book that we'll influence your way of thinking, try ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""... and you'll get ""more influence/page"""
4,"Very interesting thoughts, maybe a little too rich in detail","A summary of this book is not at all representative for its contains. The background story is at most uninteresting. What made me read this novel was the delicate description of the inside of Ulrich's head. His thoughts are deeply influenced by the troubled times of his pre-war Vienna, as are the reflections of the other main characters. In my opinion, Musil was way ahead of his times, judging by the scientific description of the passions and thoughts of the persons described. The flaw of the book, as I see it, is that he sometimes allows himself to wander too faroff with his mind-spins. The result is slightly incomprehensible at times, if not contradictory. You need time to profit from reading this book, but do it."
5,Book with qualities,This is an unfinished romance which is a kind of no romance. Robert Musil draws our attention through the riche thoughts of his personages. Personages who live in the Austro-Hungarian Empire before de world war I. This is: right before the collapse of the empire.It is a collapse which the personages seem to fell. A felling which should not be misunderstand as a prevision.The personages seem to be attached to the contradictions of an European supra-national empire in a Europe where the nationalism is the word of the day. And doing so Robert Musil draws our attention to the fact that the west contradiction is the spirit/body dualism present at least since Platon. And that the western tragedy is the permanent attempt to sum up this dualism.A great book. In my opinion a serious candidate to the best book ever written. If you are going to read it arms yourself with a pencil and make a lot of annotations in the borders.
1,Completely Useless,As a product spefically designed to treat Keratosis Pilaris - it fails dismally. I have had KP all my life and have used KP duty on my arms for the past month and it has made no difference at all. Yes my skin is quite smooth but I can get that quite easily with lots of different creams which cost a lot less than $36 and which are not designed for KP. All the bumps on my arms are still glaringly obvious and have not diminished in the slightest. I know many other people who have tried KP Duty and have had nothing positive to say about it.Don't waste your money.
1,Not effective - and it burns,"I was dissapointed in this product. It was not effective at all on my daughter's skin. Worse, if she had even the tiniest little scratch, the product would burn so badly that I had to wash it off.I submitted a review for this product on the manufacturer's website. They sent me a nice apology note, but they did not post my review. I'm just trying to stop other people from being suckered in to buying this product."
3,OUCH!,"I've only been using the product for about a week and, while my skin is softer, the product is noticably lacking a warning of some kind... if you apply the lotion to ANY sort of broken skin (read: even after shaving your legs) it burns like CRAZY.Maybe it's just me, considering I haven't seen any other comments re: this issue. Regardless, be forewarned: do not use on any sort of broken skin!"
4,It's working so far.....,"I recently purchased the KP Duty Scrub and Lotion. I've had keratosis Pilaris for almost 2 years. I think I started developing it on my arms around the time my son was born. In the past few months, it had got a lot worse. That's why I turned to KP Duty. I had tried the stuff my dermatologist gave me, and had NO change. I read about KP Duty in Good Housekeeping, so I thought I would try it. I've been using the products for almost 2 weeks, and I'm definitely seeing an improvement. My left arm looks much, much better. My right arm (which is the worst) looks better, but it's not as improved as the left. I am very diligent about application though. Twice a day for the lotion, and I use the scrub every other day. I know it says not to use it that often, but it doesn't seem to irritate my skin.I am seeing an improvement, but I think the key is diligence. The sales people who sold it to me have used it, too, and they also said you have to be very diligent about it."
2,Unfortunately was not the solution to my KP problem...shame,"This product certainly sells itself on the box, but did not help with my KP at all. It worked great on my feet, but then again, I didn't spend $36 for foot creme. Basically, for me, it was a waste of money which I wish I could get back."
4,So far doing well,So far it has dissolved the kp on my upper arms it's slowly working on my back though. I will continue to see better results.
2,Pricey treatment for dry skin. Had little effect on my twin girls' KP.,"I have purchased two large tubes of KP Duty lotion and one large container of scrub. I've used the products as suggested on my toddler girls for over 6 months. Sadly, we did not experience any improvements. The bumps on their arms, thighs and buttocks became inflamed and red after using the scrub and I did not notice a reduction in the bumpy patches. I did however, get soft hands from applying the products to my girls.We visited the dermatologist last week. He was unfamiliar with this product, but prescribed a compound of 1% hydrocortisone in an acid mantel base with 10% urea. We've used this compound for only a week and we're already seeing a great reduction in bumps.I would suggest not paying the ridiculous price for this product. The marketing is way better than the product."
5,KP Duty is THE product for KP/dry bumpy skin,"I have used everything to treat my KP - chicken-like bumps, red skin on my arms and cheecks. This product is great on my sensitive skin, and the only product that has worked for me. After a week of use I already noticed that the redness has gone down and my skin is smoother. Long term results include the smoothing of the bumps. The price is greater than some of the stuff my dermatologist gave me, but I feel it is well worth it for the great results!"
1,KP DUTY OVERHYPED OVERPRICED GARBAGE,"Not only is this product over-hyped and overpriced - but Dermadoctor website publishes only reviews with glowing comments about it! Which I did not find out until I read those glowing reviews, wasted my own money and time on this product and then posted a negative review at their site - which never showed up there! Aha, I thought, now I see their game - never will buy a single thing from them again.... Maybe it works for some - but who can know what the real results are when they don't publish both the good and the BAD reviews."
3,It works but not necessary,"I bought this product from Sephora and have been diligently using it for about a month now. Along with this product, I have been exfoliating with a 2% salicyclic scrub every other day. I noticed the bumps on my arms have significantly decreased as well as the red spots that have plagued my upper arms. But now that I have run out of this product, I decided to try something else that would be cheaper. I bought an over the counter (Vaseline) moisturizer with cocoa butter and have been using this daily as well as continuing my exfoliation. It works just as well. I think the key to KP control is exfoliation with salicyclic acid and constant moisturizing. I have very little bumps now and the redness have decreased by 50%. I am very happy with the results. So although this product worked well, a consistent regiment is key."
1,No Improvement,"I very much wanted this product to work. I read reviews from the Dermadoctor website and it seemed like a miracle product/cure for ""chicken skin"". I used the entire tube as directed and noticed no difference in my skin or any improvement whatsoever. I'm very disappointed and won't buy this product again."
2,"Helped, but does not work","It helped, it smoothed some areas on my arm, but it does not 100% remove the problem as claimed on the box."
4,MY holy grail,I use this on face daily and just love it. It really helps with my acne. My skin is nice and clear too!
4,Worth the Price,"I've had bumps on my legs for a few years. My doctors recommended various products and tricks, but nothing worked as well as this product! It does not completely eliminate the bumps, but it makes it 80% better. I have to use the product every day (and for better results, twice a day) or else the bumps reoccur. I also use the scrub about twice a week.If nothing else has worked, try this. I highly recommend this product, even though it is pricey."
1,do not be fooled like I was,"I was so disappointed in this product. From what I saw on the Dermadoctor website, it gave me hope and it has such a cute package, plus I felt like this doctor knows what she's talking about. But I used it religiously, the whole tube, and it did absolutely nothing for my KP. I felt like a loser for spending all this money on something called KP Duty that didn't work at all. I think my bumps looked a bit worse, actually, to add insult to injury. Learn from my mistake, and if you have KP, keep looking (I'm still looking for something that works!)"
1,Made my KP WORSE!,Don't waste your money. This product made the bumps on my arms even redder. I tried it for several weeks thinking it would eventually get better. The redness went away after I stopped using it and I'm back to square one.
1,Waste of Money,This product claims a lot and does little. It hasn't helped my KP at all infact I think it maybe getting worse. I have been using it for a month twice a day and nothing has changed since I started. What a waste of money. I hope I can find something to help the KP on my arms before my wedding.
3,A functional controller that works well.,"These recently arrived at my door. Eager to pop them in, I dove right in. The buttons are excellent, they do not stick and they work great. The cord is long. The D-pad isn't the most comfortable one I've used (Dragon Force was fine, but a twitcher like Tomb Raider started to get me sore), but it's an acceptable replacement. Maybe it will get less-stiff with use, but this'll work in a pinch."
4,Fun for the kids,My 3 and 4 year olds carry this around like they are in school. Lots of color pencils and fun backpack carrying case.
3,Lighten Up!,"Is it realistic? Is it hard science? Does it make sense? Probably not. But is it fun? You bet. How cool to think space travel could be for anyone. How cool to think that with a star chart and some nerve you could go anywhere in the universe before lunch. And why shouldn't trees move around? I loved it. I have always wanted to go into space just for the view. The idea I could go in the confort of my minivan is a fun thought. The book did read like a short story, but I am a working wife and mother. I need a quick read sometimes. I need one dimensional characters who are too good to be true, and I need intelligent, beautiful butterflies with timy cameras. I thought this was a great rainy day book and would highly recommend it if you feel like you will keel over from one more super-serious scifi melodrama."
2,is this supposed to be humorous or simply annoying?,"""mad scientist"" invents cheap, small hyperdrive. People go out to explore space in septic tanks and pickup trucks. No the plastic septic tank doesn't get brittle in hard vacuum - it works just fine, at least in the author's mind. They meet various races of friendly aliens, go fishing with them, drink beer and establish galactic federation. No, really. And Oltion is serious about this. If this was a satire or comedy or something it could maybe fly. But that would require some humor on the side of the author. As it is it's 2 stars and I'm generous. If you want SF avoid this book."
1,does NOT work with Windows 2000,"my rating pertains to the deception that only applies to windows 2000. I do not know how it performs in other O/S's.to quote their tech support ( which did respond very promptly)""This is a compatibility problem. This controller does not work in this system. Unfortunately, we do not have a solution at this time.""it says it compatabile with windows 2000 and it is not.Yes the USB 2.0 ports worked but that's not the point of a combo card is it? windows 2000 users don't bother."
4,Fun adventure and a fun young protagonist.,"You probably do not need to read Beyond the Deepwoods first, but I would recommend it. The story doesn't skip a beat as it transitions from book 1 to book 2, but any references to the earlier story are well explained. Stormchaser featured the same beautiful drawings by Chris Riddell and was equally as easy to read. I enjoyed book 2 a little more because it seemed that it was written for a slightly older audience, but I still feel that The Edge Chronicles is written for readers younger than ""Harry Potter"" age.I really enjoyed the look into the history and culture of Sanctaphrax and its population of academics. That was probably my favorite part of Stormchaser."
5,An excellent followup to the first,"This book is much different in theme from the first. Not only is it more plot oriented, but it is much, much darker. The politics of the floating city of academics (which, come to think of it, resembles the Philosopher's Isle in Gulliver's travels), Sanctaphrax and time spent in the bustling, corrupt Undertown are the most intruiging parts of the book. Also, the character Screed is very interesting, in an extremely gruesome, grim (or, more accurately, Grimm) sense. This book is incredibly tragic for literature labeled for 9-12 year olds, but if you are not faint of heart, it is still more than just worth reading."
5,Edge Chronicles fan,"I love the Edge Chronicles. So far this is the best. At first Twig was messing things up on the sky ship but when he became captain he tried to get through the cruel Twilight Woods and made it out into the Mire. He found ScreedToeTaker and found out who the real stone pilot really is. Finally, he finds out that Screed owns a sky ship. It's the best because it has action and adventure and it uncovers lots of secrets."
2,Horrible quality,"The quality of the picture was horrific! Could barely make out the shot, much less the people. I've seen small digital keychains before and this was not due to size, just plain poor quality."
5,ey0,"good product, was a gift for mother in law that I loaded up with pictures of my kids, it was a hit."
3,Book vs Website,"There are quite a few artists listed in this printed publication (about 50,000). However, there are over 2.1 million auction entries on their web site (for which you must pay, of course). The few times I have used the book and the website together, I have found the website to be much more comprehensive. There are many more artists listed on the website. The website even has a much more complete listing of works for each artist than is listed in the book. If you use a resource like this infrequently, my suggestion would be to skip the book and use their website. However, if you want a quick reference to put on your shelf and one that gives a general synopsis of the auction climate, buy the book."
2,Beware!!!!! Not Madonna Singing,"Just a heads up to anyone considering purchasing this Megamix. It's not original versions, despite the misleading Amazon listing. Some chick named Rachel (no last name) sings. She's not awful, but definitely not convincing as Madonna. I gave it two stars as opposed to one because for what it is, it's a heckuva lot better than some ""performed by"" singers out there and the mix is pretty decent."
2,Very dated,"The humor in this book is tongue and cheek but in a stupid kind of way. Most of jokes (Dennis Rodman, OJ Simpson, Bill Clinton, etc.) show their age and aren't really that ""timeless"". Most of the cartoons take up a full page and are only mild chuckles."
2,Not humorous,I actually found nothing in this book even remotely funny and am sorry I wasted my hard earned money on it.
3,Nice for Introduction to Turkey Hunting,"This video shows a decent amount of hunts, but does not get enough into the tactics of Turkey Hunting and strategy. I did feel it was a good intorduction to this type of hunting and do I feel I got something out of it."
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this for my husband because he couldn't get ""Metro"" out of his head and after I listened to it I liked it. The singer sounds similar Gwen Stefani way back when.... but not too much."
4,Better Late Than Early,"I thought this book would teach me how to homeschool successfully, but instead it is more of a book about why you should homeschool and why you should wait to start formal education until your child, especially your son, is 8 or older. They recommend waiting much longer than I would think is necessary for an average child. It did teach me to relax more and not worry about fine motor skills so much when my children are very young."
1,Info based on stereotypical information - not research,"For example, William Sidis is described as 'burned out', or unbalanced. At the time of his death - his friends did not think that he was either. He wasn't. He rejected capitalism, for that he is remembered, even in new books - as unbalanced. This author did not do research."
2,borrow it if you can,"This book will help you to relax about homeschooling if you're stressing about it, but other than that, i was pretty dissapointed.If i could do it again, I'd try to borrow it from someone rather than spending money on it. In fact, I'm going to donate my copy to my local library.The Moores promote their way of homeschooling as the best way and encourage you to buy their 'Manual' to learn how. If you really want to know about their method, skip this book and get their manual.Do keep in mind that the Moores were Seventh-Day Adventist, so if you're going to order from their catalog, just know that there are Adventist books in their Bible section."
5,great book,I have a lot of Joe Coleman books and this is my favorite one. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about Joe and his interesting self. Great pictures and explainations of his works featured.
1,Garbage,"This splurged is a waste of money. It does not fit securely into the headphone jack of my iPhone, my iPod Touch, or my iPad! Do not buy this useless item."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Great fun to watch Amanda with her dogs. I learned a lot from it. It is well-produced and very uplifting, not boring like some training videos. I liked the different chapters, which made it easy to go back to review just the sections I wanted to review. I'm looking forward to more videos by Amanda!"
5,Excellent training guide,"Very informative. Excellent training methods for the contacts. Really think her moving ""wait"" command is a great idea. We've been using her methods with great results. She has border collies, understands them and works well with all temperaments of her dogs."
1,Don't even bother,"I've had the same problem with these as most of these reviewers, except my kit didn't come with the oil so I had to buy my own, and it sparked and caught my cat's fur on fire within the first use! Sounds like one out of 10 of these will work as expected, not good odds in my book!"
1,look elsewere,I got these clippers to groom my cocker spaniel. I didn't even get through one clipping before they stoped cuting hair. Thankfully I can return them.
2,Worked fairly well for 5 years,I purchased this clipper set 5 years ago at a pet store. I paid about $65.00 for them. They were used on two pekingese/pomeranian mix dogs approx 4-5x/year. The clippers did a fair job up until the last year. I contribute their breakdown to my lack of maintenance (ran out of clipper oil) and I finally tried to take them apart to thoroughly clean them and couldn't get them back together again. The instructions were too vague on how to properly maintain the clippers. I am now going to bite the bullet and upgrade to a nicer set. You get what you pay for. If your dog only needs a couple trims per year or if you're a newbie that needs the blade guards I suppose $25.00 is not a bad deal.
2,Ken's Review,I have a Lahsa Apsos whose fur is too thick for the groomer. I will just have to look for a bigger and stronger groomer. I am really sorry it doesn't work as all I can do now is try to find another. If your manufacturer has a recommendation I would appreciate hearing from them. Thank you in advance for your kind help.
3,Clipper needs,"What this clipper needs is a professional groomer, then you won't have problems with mats and fur getting stuck in the blades because you used the wrong blade on your dog"
4,Excellent Product.............,I have feel really glad about amazon for these service..... thanks for your honesty and serve
5,Ah the memories,"Looking at all the other reviews I guess I am just another old git who has bought this box set because they were one of my favorite films of all time! It is great to have them all in a box set with all the quality that a DVD can give you, my only disappointment has been tha I expected a little more from the extra DVD.Still, great to have this collection. Got to say I didnt notice any deleted scenes from the film.Classic for all the family."
4,Two Thirds Good!,"Raiders and The Last Crusade have to be 2 of the best movies ever made!The YIJC tape sounds good, too. I thought Temple of Doom was terrible. I don't understand what Lucas was trying to do with that one. I'm sure some of you can agree. If you buy this, I suggest you sell Temple of Doom on Amazon.com's auction section, or something."
5,GREAT MOVIES!!!!!!!!,Harrison Ford probably the best actor ever. Indiana Jones I recommend for any movie fan to buy. But we all know The Star Wars Trilogy is the best with Harisson Ford of course.
1,The Indy Boxset,"I agree with Taylor X as well and like him I also want to make it clear that the 1-star rating is, in no way an indication of my feelings about the actual movie.This new set as reviewed earlier just incorporates new ""Featurettes"" and not full blown documentaries. What I wanted to add was that I was most disappointed with Lucasfilm not including:Great Movie Stunts and the Making of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""andGreat Adventurers and their Quests The Making of the Last Crusadedocumentaries. I have had these two on VHS forever which I quickly dubbed to DVD because they were not included in the original Trilogy release. I was really hoping this new release would have included these documentaries. At this point I would say this new release is only applicable to those who do not have the original release or feel compelled to gain the new material."
5,The Temple of Doom... the best of the series,"The 81 film is a build-up and the 1989-film showcases River Phoenix and Sean Connery to great advantage(River even performed his owns stunts...)But the best is ""The Temple of Doom""...It borrows its premises from old cheap serials, but here it is given an all-stops-out production treatment and a great performance from the future Mrs Spielberg, Kate Capshaw. The opening number is mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm as well:-)))"
4,"Great, crappy, best, fine","Raiders of the Lost ark; goodTemple of Doom; crappyThe Last Crusade; bestExtras; fineThat is all, I hope nobody found this helpful"
4,harrison ford at his best!,Indiana jones is awesome. They are the movies of the 80s and Harrison Ford is awesome! The temple of doom is third best of the series but its not bad at all! This movie is the one that started me with indiana jones. I just love short round. The part when the guys heart gets taken out is so cool. Its also one of the reasons they made the MPAA rating PG-13 they kept the movie PG though. Raiders of the lost ark was second best. The best scene is in the beginning when indiana jones gets chased by the boulder its so classic! The last crusade was the best in the series! My favorite part is when they fight the people on the tank. This is a great series to have and I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes action and adventure.
4,"Good Movies, A Bit Feature Lacking","First off, I'll say that the movies themselves are excellent, they were very well made when first released, and they look and sound even better on DVD. The adventures of Indiana Jones are pretty darn classic.That being said, I was a little dissapointed with the lack of features on this DVD set. The fourth disc, which is supposed to be loaded, isn't really. All the features could have EASILY been seperated and put on the same disc as the movie (look at the Back to the Future Trilogy) but they wanted four discs to make it look more impressive I guess. A feature commentary would have been nice, too. Perhaps some deleted scenes? I figure that if they were going to go ahead and make a fourth disc, it really should have been loaded with extras, like they claimed it would be."
2,Lost and a hassel to recover,"The product is great; the service was horrible.First, Amazon never sent it and blamed it on the mail service, who never had a tracking number for it, because Amazon never gave it to them.Then after 3 1/2 weeks and still no package or tracking number, Amazon says to wait four more days and call back.It was a Christmas present for my Mom, and she got it a week after Christmas.One would think if you order something on the 6th you would get it before Christmas not a week after it."
3,"another release, but not the last","They're probaly going to release another box with all 4 movies, even though it should have stayed a trilogy."
5,Indiana Jones,I watch it every time it comes on tv. My son really likes it also. It was given to him for a gift.
1,Must we be force-fed the weak sequels??!!,"""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is a "" ***** "" (five-star) film; a genuine adventure classic and required addition to every film buff's collection. The eyeball-rolling sequels, on the other hand, were strictly for the kiddies and the ubiquitous fast-food marketing tie-ins. For fans of the sequels (and obsessive completists), box sets are a nice option, I suppose, but the ""Indiana Jones"" DVD trilogy now joins the available-as-box-set-only ""Godfather"" collection (and the upcoming ""Star Wars"" DVD extravaganza) as a cynical slap in the face to those of us who prefer the ""a-la-carte"" option (and a little money left over for,oh, you know- rent and food). Boo! Hiss! to corporate greed and this extremely irritating industry trend."
1,where's my package?,this seller NEVER sent my package. they NEVER responded to my emails. DO NOT BUY from them!!!
1,Disappointment!,"I honor the talent of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas and I consider the Inidiana Jones trilogy to be one of the best adventures I've ever seen.I do not understand why these two great men stopped producing new masterpieces about Indiana. They have NEVER CREATED ANYTHING BETTER since that ! They wasted more then a decade of their productive professional life on creating MEDIOCRE MOVIES What's more, it looks like they decided to play money game with their audience by trying to earn as much as possible on VHS and leaving DVD release for rainy day in their careers. I am really disappointed! I think, it can push DVD release up if we stop buying VHS versions."
4,What are we talking about?,"It seems that many of us have declined the values of past histories of movies from the ""PAST"". We dig into archives, fight nasty men who safeguard these things like they are the Maltese Falcon. The truth of the matter is, it is a very pleasurable movie watch, and a very pleasurable movie to enjoy. Extras when we go this level, need to exceptional, especially in a released trilogy, I have seen no such comments. I just see wind bags complaining about inferior films. Were the Sinbad films great in their time, most definitely. If you are going to review something, keep your mind in what genre you are viewing. Don't rate as a modern day viewer. Yes, I agree we should talk about extras, but don't complain about plots, or facts, heck, we were beyond our time, when did Science Fiction, Fantasy, Adventure become cream of the crop. They had to fight for it. The world was to naive. Relax and enjoy a stepping stone to the movie world we live in. Best Wishes."
3,eh okay but not as great as everybody says,I never saw the ones with sean connery but the others I wasnt that inpressed with good for a boring night or time killers though.
2,Horrible video transfer!,"Perhaps the worst video transfer I have ever seen on DVD, disappointing for such a good movie. I've seen reviewers giving the video transfer as excellent which means either (a) they are watching the movie on a tv smaller than 27"" or (b) there are 2 different ""copies"" of the movie going around. I started watching the movie on my 8' screen and couldn't stand it; my wife immediately noticed as well. We moved to our smaller TV but noticed the same. Poor contrast, blocky image, and a bad aspect ratio. I don't think this DVD is anamorphic, as we had to watch the picture in ""zoom"" mode just to get the aspect ratio correct. We really hoped for more, especially after watching some much older classics which looked fantastic."
2,RipOff,"I feel ripped off by Lucasfilm et al. This box set has NO extras, and no real reason to by the DVD set AT ALL. if you are interested in the series purchase the remastered, widescreen VHS and save yourself some money. The fourth disk is worthless. There is nothing covered by the documentaries that you haven't seen before on AMC and they could have easily placed each one on each disc, saving you space. There is no commentary. There are no easter eggs. No extras at all. With all the wealth of information that could have been, Lucasfilm and Spielberg have cheated their fans yet again! DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!!"
1,Give me a Blu-ray set NOT more of the same,"To preface this poor review, Indiana Jones is by far one of my favorite movie series. I am an Indiana Jones fan! I understand that they wanted to add something ""extra"" in conjunction with the new movie coming out in May. HOWEVER, if they are going to do that, why not just use this opportunity to create the best possible translation of the movies in a BLU-RAY disc set and not give us a regurgetated DVD set with a few extra nibbles? I'm hopeful that this Blu-ray set will come in the fall (November) when Indy IV is released. It just seems like they are ""double dipping"" to milk the franchise while the movie is out in theaters. They are doing the exact same thing with the soundtracks by rereleasing, the best of compilation when Extended versions of the out of print originals are supposed to be released later this year. ""Capitalism Baby, Yah!."" There are going to be quite a few people that will wish they had waited..."
5,Indy,Spend some time with a childhood hero. This set of Indy's adventures is well worth devouring some Sunday afternoon.
5,IMPERDIBLE,"Que ""Indy"" llegue por trilogia es una gran oferta que nadie debe perdersela...... 100% accion.... toda una aventura por triple entrega....."
3,"Indiana Jones, why buy it at Amazon","This is a joke, $65.00----save 35%....You can buy it at Costco and Sams Club for $41.00.....I love Amazon.com, but please do not insult my intelligence. There has to be an incentive to buy remotely. Like another 15-20%????"
5,Excellent Transfer,"I owned Indana Jones The Last Crusade on laserdisc and I don't think the laserdisc version is as good as this DVD collection. The Indiana Jones DVD trilogy is the best video transfer I've seen. Great colors, awesome THX sound. This collection is a must-have for any IJ fans."
4,indian jones adventure collection,"very please with the DVD, it was in very good shape and played well. it came in a timely manner."
3,You can't go wrong with Indiana Jones,"This is not blue ray by any means, however, it has good audio. The special effects are a little cheesy. I was hoping that they would have cleaned it up a little. My main reason for buying this box set... I'm going to pull out the extras disk and put the newest DVD in its place. Making it a cost effective boxed set."
3,Critique Indiana Jones films,"The first DVD in the series was in excellent condition, I expected all to be the same since they were new, but Temple of Doom kept sticking, finally stopped.. had smudges on it.. didn't understand at all since they were sold as new. Haven't viewed the last tapes; this is ""memory"" ride."
4,Indiana Jones boxset review,"I bought this boxset awhile back. It's a pretty good transfer for the most part. The visuals and audio is fine. My only real complaint is when I got I was hoping it was going to be a transfer of the original versions. Instead a lot of scenes are from new tv edit versions that one would see on television. For example, I don't know if a lot of people have seen the original version of Temple Of Doom but in the scene where after Mola Ram pulls the sacrifice's heart out we see Mola Ram rapidly repeating the words on screen while the sacrifice is lowered in the fire pit. In the original version we would see the sacrifice being lowered in the pit and then just his heart in Mola Ram's hand steaming, beating faster, and getting hotter until it catches fire."
1,Widespread Problem of this DVD set,"Beaware.I returned this item 3 times because disk 3 ALWAYS comes defective and does not play the entire movie.Amazon.com refused to send me any more replacement because the problem is widespread. They don't know when the studio is going to fix this problem.If you don't wanna risk yourself to get in the same problem as mine, WAIT for a while (until the studio fixes the problem) to purchase this set."
5,Indiana Jones Trilogy- Widescreen,"If you are looking for the original three Indiana Jones movies, starring Harrison Ford, this trilogy set (with one extra disc of bonus features) is exactly the version you are looking for. It is a bit confusing that this product comes up as ""The Adventures of Indiana Jones"" first, since the tv series was named that. I assure you that these discs are the original movies. Good quality, decent price and extra bonus features- can't go wrong with a classic!"
5,Perfect Intro for the New Indy,This may not be the perfect choice for Indiana Jones afficionados but there is quite a few billion people around who never had the chance to see the movies before. These three film rank among the best adventure movies of the last half century (OK - they ARE the best ;) so don't think too long but grab at the opportunity to be really prepared for the last part of Indiana Jones' adventures.You get quite a handful of new (and not so new) extra material thrown in but it is the movies that really matter. And they are so fresh and full of live that it is hard to believe it has been a while since Indiana Jones seemed to have retired for good.
3,Disappointing quality,"The long-awaited saga of Indiana Jones is still agreat yarn, but is unappealing inside and out: The outside is held in less than fashionable poo-brown, and little or nothing has been done to work up the quality of sound and picture since the original release. In parts it sounds like they are holding the microphone under water! In little or no time we will, no doubt, be blessed with the 'ultimate edition'or the 'director's cut', or something like it, where these problems will have been addressed. In the meantime, don't get your expectations up too high."
3,Full Screen edition,"I love these movies, so I decided it was time to upgrade my VHS set, and I opted for this one. Unfortunately, in my haste to get it, I forgot what ""Full Screen"" means. In my case, it means it is NOT full screen. If you have a ""modern"" TV, be sure to get the ""Wide Screen"" version."
5,named the dog indiana,Arrived on time and was in good condition. Watched all 3 in the same week. Who needs the Crystal Skull anyways??Thanks for the reasonable price. happy valentines day matt
4,Indiana Jones is the real deal.,"First of all I read some of the reviews on Amazon about color, contrast, and sound for this box set and here are my comments:1. I found an issue with the sound on disc 2 and 3 and returned the set and got a second. Got the second and had the same problem. The third on was fine. I call the manufacturer and they said there was a limited run with ths problem and they have fixed it.2. The color on my dvd's were fine.Now lets talk Indiana:Harrison Ford is my hero. His acting and performance in Star Wars and Indiana Jones is what makes the movie. His charisma and extrodinary acting make these films inspirational, addictive, and classic; and that is why you will watch these adventurous movies time and time again.Great adventures, strong plots, and a fabulous cast.Its a must for your collection.Stephen John Becciaauthor of The Treelanders"
3,Where's the DVD ?,"I know this is the VHS version, but I must ask where the DVD is? I am aware that there are something like 600 million VCRs in homes across the US and only about 3 million DVD players (*currently) ... however, as a DVD owner, I feel left out with the release of the INDIANA JONES VHS set. I just don't want to spend $30-something on tapes that I'll eventually replace with a DVD -- whenever it is Lucasfilm releases it! The Indiana Jones trilogy are my favorite movies. I WANT to own them. But I'm afraid I must practice patience (or ""count to 10"" as Indy's pop would say ... although I think the DVD release is more than ""10"" away ...) My favorite is RAIDERS. I love the way TEMPLE OF DOOM switches gears. And CRUSADE is fun, but ultimately unmemorable. Now ... if only I could view them in widescreen DVD (with extras, please, Mr. Lucas!) tick ... tick ... tick ..."
4,*****Part I / ****Part II / ***Part III,"I LOVED the first 'Indy' adventure. It was a throwback to the old classic serials and reminded us all why the movies have been an important part in our lives. ""I HATE SNAKES!!!"" will always remain one of my favorite quotes. 'Temple of Doom' was still pretty good, but excessively violent (one reason for the PG13 rating). 'Doom' has one helluva rollercoaster type ride through a mine shaft that ends up on a falling rope bridge. This is exciting stuff. By the time 'Crusade' came out, the cast was older, and the action seemed tamed. The focus was on the comical bantering with father and ""Junior"" and not what made the other two great action films. Still, if you are alone in the house and its raining, this trilogy is a great way to pass the day away."
5,"A Must Have, Timeless entertainment, Action Adventure sprinkled with humor","Recently I realized that my own children had never seen all the Indiana Jones Trilogy. We set aside a Sunday and watched them all, with a break for a family barbeque. These movies were made from 1981 through 1989 I believe. My children who are 22 and 24 were born in 1983 and 1985. They loved them and I know someday my grandchildren will also. These movies were very well done, with action, adventure, humor and the good always wins eventually. A timeless must have collection."
5,Great Movie Package!!,So very happy with this set. It was a great deal for the money and can't wait to add the newest Indie movie to this collection.
5,indidana jones trilogy,My product was shipped rapidly and was in perfect condition when it arrived - just as advertised. I'm very satisfied.
5,High adventure must have...,"An excellent collection of the greatest high adventure movies ever made... Indiana Jones resurrected the serial cliffhangers with gusto, charm, and great storytelling..."
4,Harrison Ford is always worth seeing,"The original Raiders of the Lost Ark is by far the best of the three. In fact, the other two don't even compare, but both of my children enjoy them all and that is good enough for this mom!"
2,No commentary on the best adventure movie of all time?!,"Of course the Indy movies are terrific, that's common knowledge. The thing is, issuance of the film on DVD requires higher standards in this day and age. All great movies on DVD today deserve at least four features: 1. anamorphic wide-screen (if applicable), 2. restored video and audio, 3. sub-titles, and 4. COMMENTARY. Paramount, you deserve the Bronx cheer for cheating the world of a commentary on one of the best movies of all time. Pthhhhhhhhhh!"
3,"One Good, One Sucks, One Average -- Seriously Overpriced","Raiders remains a more or less entertaining way to kill a couple of hours. Temple Of Doom is as bad as movies get, easily the worst film of the 1980s. Last Crusade is passable, instantly forgettable nonsense saved only by the sight of Sean Connery calling Harrison Ford ""Junior.""I'm a little sick of the marketing strategy of selling a series of films as a box set only, rather than as a series of individual DVDs. This is done, clearly, to even out the sales: more people are likely to buy Raiders than the other two, so they stick them all in a box and jack up the price. I'm just not terribly happy about having to blow $45 on two movies that I'll never watch again, just to get one movie that I like.Haven't Spielberg and Lucas made enough money by now without having to rip us off this way?"
3,Great Movies But...,"If they put out a special WIDESCREEN version that is ""enhanced for 16:9 TVs"", there should be no letterbox."
2,disappointing,this redigitized films are advertised as having full screen format. They came in wide-screen format and narrow wide-screen at that; and they cost more than the other set that is advertised as having wide-screen format. Quite disappointing.King watcher
2,DVD's have errors!,"I thought DVDs didn't suffer from errors these days?All the disks in this boxed set have errors on my SonyDVD player. It's not like a lot of folks don't have SonyDVD players...About every 10th chapter the disk will pause and will thenjust randomly jump to some other chapter, usually 3 chaptersback, but sometimes 1 forward or 2 forward.While the sound and remastering are great, the packaging isextra lame, just a simple paper cover on a cardboard box.And with all the rain in Seattle, the paper cover became allwarped and wrinkled from the humidity.I wonder if the DVD problems are systemic or just on my player?I guess I will just have to return it and get my money back and waitfor ""revision 2.0""."
1,These Movies are Great,"This is the Worst double dipping ever. worse then the Star Wars. at least he changed things with the feature. digital remastered. Here all that was done is change the Box Set. from The Adventures of Indiana to the Indiana-THe Adventure Collection, and added one or two never before seen bonus material. First of all? Is there a Mystery collection? horror Collection? of course its called the THE ADVENTURE COLLECTION. its Indiana friggin Jones.seriously, if you want the first three get the other set its cheaper. or wait till christmas, when ALL 4 will be in a Box-SET.TRIPLE DIP!"
1,Terrible video quality,Got 10 minutes into the 1st movie and noticed the focus changing when they entered the cave. It would go fuzzy then clear up....fuzzy then clear up. I wonder it's just this set or all sets have this problem. I'll try a new set and see. Just beware.
4,Why buy now?,"I'll start this review out by stating that these are some of the best action movies ever made. That's why it received the 4 star vote from me. It didn't get the 5 star vote because I really don't like the re-releases. But the real meat of my review has to do with a question on my part. The question being...why buy these movies again now, when you know that once the 4th movie goes to DVD there will be some massive 4 disc (or 8 disc if each were to get double-disc sets) on either DVD or Blu-ray Disc that will likely be the ""definitive"" set (if there really is a definitive set for DVDs anymore)? Just thought I'd put my 2 cents in there and say...save your 3999 cents. Thanks."
1,Shame on you George...,I agree 100% with Taylor X. The new bonus features seem more like featurettes than actual documentaries. I'll pass thanks. Hands up- who thinks there will be yet another box set with all 4 Indy movies by Christmas?
2,Temple of Doom ruins the whole trilogy,"Raiders of the Last Ark is great, Last Crusade is mediocre, but Temple of Doom is just plain awful. I remember liking it as a kid, but yuck, I had to vacuum through that last half."
4,Must have for your library.,"I just received my set. I have enjoyed the artwork for the box. It is a very welcome addition to my own library of DVDS. The transfer to DVD is great. The movies look fresh still. The new 5.1 surround sound is well done and delightful. The movies themselves are a must to own. I somewhat disagree with the MPAA's rating for Temple of Doom, it seems a bit strong for PG, granted, if I am not mistaken, PG-13 was not an option then. The heart removal thing seems harsh. Other than that, the movies are great. I applaud Lucasfilm's effort to porduce new matertial and interviews for the fourth bonus disc. However I give only 4 stars for the lack of feature length commentaries. A bonus addition that seems almost standard on most big productions."
5,Indy Rocks!,Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones is just incredible! He is the best hero! All 3 movies rock! (Esp. the third with Sean Connery as Indy's father)
1,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"Who in the HELL did the audio transfer on this! There seem to be dropouts and dips all over the place in voices and music, not to mention in general very low audio levels. Chapter 16 55min 40sec for example. Marcus Brody and Sallah are talking, along with crowd noise and music in the background. For no reason, the voices drop in level and the background crowd and music levels almost drop out. Hang onto your Laser Videodiscs of these movies- we're going need them if you want to watch with enjoyment."
1,Enough already !,"WWII has been over for almost sixty years now,isn't it about time we stopped cranking out the anti-German propaganda.The war is over,the hate should be over too."
5,Best of Harrison Ford,"Hours of Harrison Ford in one of his best characters, how can you beat that? Of course it's fantastic"
5,Great to the last drop.,"Hands down the best action series ever made, and a even better DVD collection. One of the few movie series that had every movie in it be as good as the other than come before.Do not call yourself a fan of the DVD format if you don't own it."
5,Anything less than 5 stars would be wrong!,Raiders i give 5 stars and temple I give 4 1/2 stars and last crusade i give 4 1/2 stars.This is one of my favorite trilogys.How can you not like indiana jones.this is my favoirte series as along with die hard series.starwars is great but this one i like much more.cant wait for part 4.but i always wanted to know why it took 18 years to make it?anyway great films on dvd.the picture is great and so is the audio.
5,Bring on the DVD collection,"The Indiana Jones movies would have to rate amongst my most favourite action movies. Like a lot of other people, I refuse to purchase the collection in VHS format. Unfortunately, as wealthy as people like Lucas and Spielberg are, they still want to exhaust the VHS market before they venture into the DVD market. Let's face it, they're doing the same thing with the Star Wars movie collection. I'm sure there will always be a market for their VHS versions, but no matter how desperately I want to add this trilogy to my collection, I will wait for the DVD version to come out... and hope that it does."
5,Good product,Used DVDs in excellent condition. The product arrived in time. This was a gift for my son who passed his elementary school with all A's. Indiana Jones will for ever be a classic. We have seen these movies a couple of times now.
5,Indiana Jones Set Review,"I enjoyed the movies very much and I would really recommend them to people to purchase and own these DVDs. Harrison Ford is a great actor. You can put him in line with Sean Connery, George Clooney, Cary Grant, and many others."
4,"Very entertaining, except for the worst movie ever (Temple of Doom)","The making of the movies were excellent. The first and third installments were also great; just as I remember them. I had never seen the Temple of Doom before, and I couldn't finish this awful sequel. It was too painful to watch."
5,Indiana Jones - classic,"I am very pleased with my purchase - it arrived quickly, in good condition and the price was good.I've always loved Indiana Jones since I was a child and wanted it for a long time. I'm pleased with this purchase and would reccomend it to anyone who wants to own these movies."
5,Three Masterpieces!!!,"Three of the best films ever made. Each one with equally intense and interesting stories. After viewing these, one can only await the fourth installment to this classic movie series. I also recommend the Young Indiana Jones chronicles, which are slower in pace, but deliver storylines that match the creativity of the movies and fit the movies perfectly."
1,"Lucas & Paramount -- Issue ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" solo!","I cannot rate this trilogy release beyond the one star (I'd skip rating it at all, but the Amazon system won't allow it), as I REFUSE to purchase it. I Loved, Loved, LOVED the now-classic first film...only tolerated the second...and thoroughly enjoyed the third. However...the only one I MUST have on DVD is the first one.But...I cannot (at present) BUY What I Want, because in their arrogance, George Lucas and Paramount assume I Must Have ALL of their product in this case, leaving me No Choice Except to Buy Three or Buy NONE. Ridiculous -- and with luck, the market will convince them of this. If not (shrugs) I buy none and I guess I live without it and keep running my VHS tape until it breaks.I understand the Godfather Trilogy DVD Box set didn't do as well as was orignally hoped, forcing the studio to release the first film separately...I'm keeping my fingers crossed for another such event."
1,Consumer Alert! Deleted Scenes!,"I loved this movie when it came out in theaters. I loved this movie when it was shown on television, both network and cable. However, some scenes were deleted from the DVD. For example, when Indy is in the well of souls, a bunch of rats flee an oncoming wave of gasoline/oil and the ensuing fire. That entire scene is missing from the DVD. As consumers, we should boycott such modifications of great works of art. Do not rent or buy the DVD! Stick to the video."
1,Lucas has destroyed his legacy,I grew up with Star Wars and Indy. Both beloved series held dear to my heart. I grew up and George Lucas became a very rich man because of kids like me who spent their allowance on star wars toys and at the movie theater to watch Indiana Jones. But as Lucas got more money Lucas became more greedy and the wonderful magic that he penned turned into garbage.Lets just call it for what it is folks. The Star Wars prequels and the add ons to the original series are garbage. Nothing more than a money grab just like this new box set that Lucas has churned out.I am no longer a fan of Lucas. I have no faith what so ever in anything with his name attached to it. All I can think about when I hear his name is money.Great legacy Lucas.
3,Too bad they aren't available individually at this time,"Swell. Raiders of the Lost Ark is available at last on DVD. Unfortunately, we have to buy the other two mediocre films along with it. Buying the entire boxed set in order to get ROTLA is like marrying an incredible woman with 2 rancid smelling sisters with persistent (though hopelessly flat & obvious) senses of humor who are always trying to crash on your couch. TOD & TLC are mildly amusing in that terrible but watchable Goonies/Return of the Jedi way, but they certainly are not worth the hero's welcome associated with the marketing campaign.Marion = cool.Willie = not cool.Only the most forgiving film critic or the most avid completist would bother purchasing TOD & TLC (restored or not) if they were available separately. Hence this boxed set."
3,Individual Please,"Why won't these films be released separately? Answer: to sucker you into buying The Temple of Doom. While Spielberg and the Hollywood elite i.e. George Lucas condemn corporate greed and the president, they are doing the same thing. First we get the director's cut which is never better that the theatrical release. Then we get boxed sets. Then they re-release them with new special effects which isn't needed. Then ten years later they release them individually, and if you are a sucker you end up with three copies of the same movies. Not me. Is Mr. Lucas going to fool Spielberg to cgi Jaws? I fortunately have Jaws in all its glory as it was orginally released, no cgi needed thank you. If the hollywood elite really were concerned about the little people then they won't participate in the fraud as in the Star Wars mess or whatever the names of those movies are now."
3,"Great Movie, Poor Quality DVD","Raiders is one of my favorite movies and one of the few movies I can watch over and over, but I was very dissappointed in the quality of the DVD video. I have about 40 DVDs and the quality of this is by far the poorest video of them all. Watching Raiders on commercial TV might be better quality. Maybe they digitally remastered the sound but forgot to do the video."
1,I was not happy at all.,"I ordered this product on May 31st. As of July 1st, I have not received the product."
5,Raiders Rocks !,"This is definetly the ultimate adventure movie starring Harrison Ford as the Dr. Jones who want to get the lost ark before the nazis. The specials effects are superb, the score is terrific and the cast is great. It's just to bad you can't find it on DVD yet but probably soon as possible it will be released."
5,DVDDVDDVDDVDDVD,"I just ordered this, but should the DVD-version be released soon, I'll probably buy that too (as I would Star Wars)."
4,Great Classic Indy Movies!,"In my opinion, I think this release of the Indiana Jones movies is very well done. It's not blu-ray, but still very good if played on a blu-ray player as they tend to ""upgrade"" standard DVD's a bit anyway. Never-the-less, I gave it 4 stars because it isn't blu-ray. Sound quality is good and the picture is sharp on all three videos. If you're a fan of the Indiana Jones movies and your VHS versions have just about had it, then you wont be disappointed in these.I would recommend them as a good investment.As with all my reviews, the above is only my opinion of an item that I own or have tested. Depending on the overall rating that I give it, It is possible that I may have either purchased or tested a faulty unit or an exceptionally good one. Your experience may be better or worse than mine. Paying attention to the up or down trend from several reviewers will help you make your decision.Best of Luck!!"
5,A great package deal!,"With the exception of Temple of Doom, the Indiana Jones movies are a great way to while away a rainy afternoon, or just watch for pure entertainment."
4,RAIDER OF THE LOST ARCH,"I've loved these films sinse childhood and I've seen them...god only knows how many times! Yes, Indiana Jones is a classic adventure/comical trilogy that everyone has seen and enjoyed. It's a rare treat and few of its kind can compare to it--but then, there ARE few of its kind. A relic-hunting professor and great adventurer? These are must-see films and a good gift set for anyone who enjoys them (How can you not?) Inigmatic, optimistic and fun-loving films, and one of Lucas Studeos' best products."
4,great way to introduce your kids to your childhood,these worked perfectly for our 9 hr trip to and from florida. we haven't checked out the bonus material yet and are now eager to go see the new movie in theaters.
4,Nicely Done,Thought this one was the better of the Collector's Sets even though it cost less - a good value for Jones fans!
4,"Just the Facts, Ma'am","A fairly bare-bones collection of the first three movies. The lack of commentaries is dissappointing, but if what you're really after are the flicks themselves, this ain't a bad way to get 'em."
4,The Adventures of Indiana Jones,A great collection. Disappointed that the new DVDre: Crystal Skull was not yet available.
2,What Happen to the Transfere?,I love these movies but what happened to the contrast / color? I played them on two different TV/DVD player combos cause I thought I had a problem. These have to be the worst professional transferes I have ever seen. Extremely dark. I've done better transferes with my home movies. Hold off buying this set until you have seen them and judge them for yourself. These may not be worth the $45.00+ for them. The stills on the covers are better then the movies. Very Very Bad!!!!! This bothers me that someone of this talent would allow this to hit the street in this condition. Lucas / Spielberg are suppose to be the best in the market. You can't prove it by this set. I've seen bootlegs better than these. What are you people thinking? Didn't anyone proof these when you got done? I can't believe it took this long to get this garbage out. Is this a ploy to force people to buy the new remastered/redigitized/recolored deluxe set in 2 years?
3,"No fullscreen DVD! + ""Raiders"" name changed!","I have three criticisms about what otherwise will likely be an excellent DVD set:1. Why can't I just buy ""Raiders"" by itself? That's all I want to own, really....2. The name of the film is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" However for the sake of packaging, it's now called ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark."" That's about the dumbest thing I've seen come out of LucasFilm since Greedo firing first.3. And is there a DVD Fullscreen version? Amazon doesn't seem to have it. When will producers get that even we folks with BIG television screens would rather have 1.85-1 aspect ratio rather than 2.35-1. Or at least have a fullscreen option. Hope I'm wrong here and it's available fullscreen on DVD.So for these reasons I give this product three stars, even with the assumption that the video/audio quality will be superb and the fourth DVD will be way cool."
3,Where are the special features??,"These are great movies and it is definitely time they were released on dvd for all to enjoy over and over again. I am very disappointed with the lack of special features though. Everything is found on the fourth bonus disc, but there is nothing on the movie discs. This great set could have been made even better with the addition of commentary or deleted scenes. I would have thought with the timeless popularity of the trilogy that something more would have been given to the fans."
5,Movie fans,We had been looking for the set of Indiana Jones movies once we heard they were making a new one. After looking at several stores in town we actually found it at Amazon for a much lesser price. Very pleased with shopping at Amazon.
4,Awesome Sound!!!!!!!!,"Damn they do a very great job with the sound, you can feel all the exciting in this three movies.BTW the best are Lost Ark and The last crusade"
2,A must have? Not really,"I bought this set because I wanted to watch them again before going to the 4th Indiana Jones movie. I am really disappointed. I have to say, unlike real classics, these three movies are outdated. The plots are silly, the chase sequences are unbearably noisy and unnecessary. Spielberg makes popular movies. But just like most of the pop culture, they just fade away in time."
2,"2 stars for wide screen, - 3 stars for VHS","Lucas himself has confirmed that the DVD's are being prepped for release next year. So, If DVD is important to you, I would wait."
3,very much like the godfather trilogy,"i doubt this trilogy needs to be summerized.im pretty sure everyone and their cousins has seen these.the first 2 parts were spectacular,then comes the mockery part 3.and whats this spliting up full frame/wide screen versions?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?gollywood strikes again.in closing,the 1st 2 were spectacular,the 3rd was amazingly forgettable.how long before giftbox set special version with never befores?!?!?!?!?!?"
4,"Finally, an action movie for the whole family.","This is a voilent movie, I'm not going to lie to u, but it's sooo good, the whole family will be able to appericate it."
4,captions,"At least on the set I'm watching, the captions on the extra disc are attempted but are NOT well done. It's apparent that they haven't been ""cleaned up,"" so understanding can be iffy. I appreciate the effort, but it would be nice if the execution were better."
5,Excellent!,"My DVD set was perfect, perfect visual and audio and everything. The only thing it didn't come with was the outside jewel case which is fine, it isn't a necessity. If you like action movies you must, must, must get Indiana Jones. They were made before I was even born but I still love them and they are a few of my favorite movies. I can't wait until the next one comes out. Shia Lebouf is a great upcoming actor and I think he will handle the role very well."
5,Alison Doody,"Everybody knows how good this three movies are, for sure, I'm not going to tell you that again. I'm going to praise the beauty and talent of Miss Alison Doody, the magnificent blonde who brights as a star in ""The Last Crusade."" It was wonderful to see her talking about her role 14 years later, and she's still as beautiful as she was on that movie. Too bad she dissapeared and we never saw her in a big role. Maybe she already knew that Showbiz life ..., and that's why she didn't put the effort. Hot and clever as Elsa..."
2,Yuk...maybe I should have ordered the full screen version...,"Disappointing... Great audio, terrible video...way too dark, and flat. Maybe if you have something larger than the 27"" monitor I have this looks better, especially if you're watching the wide screen version that I purchased. Really sorry I bought this. Leaves me yearning for my old VHS copy..."
4,Great movies!,"This trilogy belongs in every movie buffs collection. If you don't have it already, this is the set to get."
4,"Awesome Movies, but no Deleted Scenes on 4th disc...","These movies were great and my favorite was the first movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark. This set could be improved, because THERE ARE NO DELETED SCENES. Actually, there is one, and it is in the making of Raiders of the Lost Ark and it is only part of the scene. It is a scene where Marion kisses Indy right before he leaves Marion's bar in Nepal."
5,du du dah dah dah da daaa - it takes you back,"A box set of the best movies from my childhood. Need I say more. Action, humour and adventure and Harrison Ford looking hot. What more could you want in three great movies which also has a bonus DVD. This was the best value box set price that I could find too."
4,An unusual song,"I became a fan of Imagination when I was first introduced to the original'Burnin up'(81'). At first I didn't really appreciate it but as time went on I grew to love it - so much that I started playing the piano because of that one song.I have produced many versions of that song and I'm working on a rendition of it, with my own piano melodic solo.This song is so different than the rest of their hits that it's more of a fusion combination of disco, rag-time, jazz and R&B."
4,Worth reading,"I read Tracy's ""Number Seventeen"" and now ""The Stowmarket Mystery,"" and I look forward to reading others by this author. Tracy should appeal to modern readers for his direct, generally unadorned style and quick-moving plots. Interestingly, despite a prose that is mostly utilitarian, you get a sometimes vivid sense of aspects of late Victorian England. If (for instance) you think that London streets were safer before the automobile was introduced, read this book.The investigator Brett is a lawyer, a professional in the mold of Freeman's Dr Thorndyke, who discovers clues and makes connections that others miss. His relationship with the police in the form of Inspector Winter is adversarial, but not without a certain amount of mutual respect (somewhat like the Furneaux/White relationship in Tracy's ""Number Seventeen"").Though I've only read 2 novels by Louis Tracy, I think he's held up better than other half-forgotten mystery writers of the period."
1,Poor quality,Very disappointed with the ring. Turned my finger green. Can't wear it accept on a chain. Beautiful ring but poor quality silver.
3,Some good stuff but...,"Dirty Sexy Money is watchable but it's not riveting. Some scenes like the one where the Nick George character gets kissed by his ex and caught by his super sexy wife, are so telegraphed that it hinders the script. Even though you can pretty much guess the plot, there are worst ways to spend a weekend. Just make sure it's a rainy day weekend with a close friend."
5,Highly Recommend,Very good series that has a really good cast. It has a few twists that keeps you watching one episode after the other.
2,is this only half the season?,"There are only 10 episodes, think they forgot to make the last 10 episodes that would complet the season- it leaves you with all the main story lines midflow, which is a shame as it seemed to eventually get going by the last few episodes. would give it 4 or 5 stars if it was a completed series, but half a series get half the score!"
3,Very good until Juliet enters the picture,"It is a very good series until Juliet enters the picture. Watching her was bothersome, her character closely resembling the shallowness of Paris Hilton. If you are over the age of 16, plain and simple, she is just irritating. I fast forwarded her parts. Nick, the family lawyer, was excellent just like he was in Six Feet Under. He is a pleasure to watch."
4,Encourage coloring outside the lines!,I really liked this book and the message it sends. The best artists are generally those who follow their own hearts - as illustrated by the ultimate realism of Bear's picture! The theme of this book is very similar to The Art Lesson by Tomie dePaola.The Art Lesson (Paperstar Book)
5,A book for art lovers and kids alike,"I love that this book focuses on the individuality that artists have, and shows a young audience that it's alright to ignore the criticism of people would would try to tell you that your art isn't good enough. I absolutely love DB Johnson's illustrations. There's nothing quite as nice as his blocky bright prints."
3,"Good product, Bad company","I had bought this as a promise ring, but it arrived a week after I was supposed to get it. It was too late to give it to my girlfriend because she went back to college two days before I actually received it. I contacted the company and they gave me a cookie cutter apology that upset me."
1,Silver Ring,"Disapointed when I first got the ring in my hand.The flower is much more flat compared to the vivid look on the picture. The color is way different from what it looks on the picture as well, much brighter. This makes the ring looks un-balanced and cheap.I won't order it if I had ever a chance to put it on my finger.Won't bother to return though as I've already paid $5 for S&H;."
5,Check Plus,"My friend and I decided that we wanted to get friendship rings. When we saw this ring, we knew it was perfect. [...]. It came in a pretty little box and bubble-wrapped. When I opened the ring, it looks just as pretty as when I first saw it. Their is a somewhat antiqued finish, but not too much.The ring sizing is exact, and it fits very nicely. It also does not turn my finger funny colors like other rings, and as I am paticularly hard on my jewelery, it is very strong. You would be led to believe that intracite details would be more prone to breaking, however that is completely incorrect in this case.[...]."
2,Not so deluxe after all,"I purchased two of these units and found that the volume function on the remote does not work on either unit. I contacted XACT (which was a huge hassle) and talked to supervisor after supervisor and the only explanation they could give me to why the volume could not be adjusted from the remote was that "" it was manufactured that way""... are you kidding, i had stereo's 20 years ago that had a remote that could control volume. Other than that the unit is fine, but I just feel a state of the art ""deluxe"" boom box should be able to adjust the voulume via the remote. Why else would you waste 2 buttons on the tiny remote. It is just a pain to have to physically increase or decrease the volume manually."
4,Better than XM boombox,I've had the XM Delphi boombox for two years now. Today I bought the XS027 for a friend.I too was frustrated with the volume control on my remote with the boombox. They need to put a info sticker on the remote. I have had equipment where the remote turned the volume knob with a motor. I like this type of analog volume control. I'm assuming the volume works with the car and home kits.I think the box sounds really good. The inclusion of the radio and CD player is a plus for those very rare occasions. CD plays MP3 too. The aux is jack is something usually not included in products like this. Nice to see it and a rear line out jack on this product.
3,XAct XS027 Sirius Satellite Radio Portable Boombox with CD Player and AM/FM Tuner,"I expected something a little ""beefier"" for the price. The speakers are pretty bland...not much range. The screen is hard to read also when using the CD player. Beyond that, it is great to have a ""portable"" satellite radio now."
2,Small and limited,"This is a very minimalist bilingual dictionary. It might be useful for some travelers, but with only 12,500 entries, it is too limited for any other purposes. It certainly wouldn't be satisfactory for students trying to read Swedish books, for example, because too many words just aren't there. Pronunciation guidance is provided in both languages. Special features included in the dictionary are food and drink lists in both Swedish and English, irregular verbs and abbreviations, numbers, and how to tell time, in both languages. If you are planning on traveling to Sweden and don't know the language at all, perhaps this dictionary might be useful. It's certainly small enough to stick in your pocket."
1,Not the product shown,I paid extra to get the nice container shown in the picture. Instead it came in a cheap plastic tub. Rip off!
3,Wrong container,"Part of the reason I chose this candy is the red retro container, but that was not what I received. It shipped in a clear plastic rectangular bucket. This is false advertising. The photo should be an EXACT representation of what is shipped. Only keeping it due to time restraint."
1,Fast delivery. I won't be buying more of these.,This products light output is very minute. Barely noticeable. I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe several dozen may provide a very dimly lit area. The moonlight will outshine these tenfold.
4,I love it,"After about a month using this product, I noticed a difference. It is gentle and works effectively. I recommend it."
1,doesn't work any better than regular anti-perspirant,"However, it is more expensive. Not worth the extra money. I tried it, my husband tried it.... we really gave it a shot hoping it would work for us but alas..."
2,meeh,"it didnt work as i expected it to. my underarms are still dark. the bottle says to wait 6 months to see a difference and i used it for 1.5years just to see if i would see a least bit of a difference. i used it correctly, everyday after my shower, and nothing changed. oh and it does NOT work as antiperspirant or deodorant so you might want to use your normal antiperspirant over this if you do decide to purchase it"
1,"Unfortunately, this didn't work for me.",Sad to report that this very promising product turned out to be nothing more than very disappointing. No whitening at all and I had used it for several months.
5,An amazing collection!,"For most people, the term ""folklore"" probably conjures the image of songs and stories, but as Daryl Cumber Dance illustrates, it's much more than that. It's about quilts and the history they embody. It's about hair styles, dress, food, traditions of marching bands, sermons, speeches...even internet rumors and graffiti. As one chapter is headed, it's about ""The Style of Soul.""Start at any topic that piques your interest, and I promise, you'll find it impossible to put this book down. There are surprises around every corner...for example, I was delighted to find a low fat recipe for greens!This vast, rich book belongs in every library.Curator, AfroAmericanHeritage dot com"
2,Probably not for anyone who loved the original songs,"Fans hoping to hear Inoue Kikuko's rendition of some of Japanese animation's most well-known theme songs will likely be disappointed with this disc. I strongly recommend listening to the music samples before purchasing. The music has been totally remixed into techno with a very strong beat. The remixes themselves aren't particularly inspired, with extended moments of repetition acting as filler. The vocal parts of each track act almost in a secondary role; they are relatively short and are mixed in at such a low level that it's almost lost in the background.My verdict: Kikuo-san's voice is as beautiful as ever; so it's truly a pity that it was wasted on this disc."
2,Not what I expected at all...,"I got two copies of this CD, one for myself and another for a anime-loving friend. When it arrived, I was excited to see how it would be, because the titles looked terrific. These are a good representation of what's out there in anime music (which made me give this CD those two stars.) However, in my initial excitement when seeing this on amazon.com, I must have overlooked the fact that these were remixes. Kikuko Inoue has a nice voice and all, but the remixes don't do justice to the songs as they were originally, generally speaking. I'm a huge fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion's ""Thesis of a Cruel Angel,"" and I couldn't even listen to the entire track on this CD. For those of you who like new twists to your favorite anime songs, by all means, don't let my opinion be the deciding factor as to whether or not you get this CD. But for those of you who expect something like the original, don't bother with this one. Save your money up for that import instead!"
4,nice case for my laptop,"This laptop carrying case is satisfying for its price. Good quality. Plenty of compartments for everything you need to put in. It's big enough for my 13.3 inch laptop, can hold bigger ones. Strong, comfortable and safe (nice cushions). Only thing I don't like much is the bright color. But if you got a very cute laptop, it'll suit."
5,open the door for a new conversation,Ivy says what many of us in children's ministry have been thinking. We need to realy need to think about how we treat kids in church. Ivy opens the conversation with a book which is well though out and written with her open and honest style. It comes not only with philosphical thoughts but also with practical ideas. A must read for all who care about children in the church.
3,Good Ideas along with some weird ones.,"At some points in the book she seems to contradict herself. A little bit of the book is confusing to read, and some of her ideas seemed a little weird (but I guess everybody is different). She did say that she was saved before she asked Jesus into her heart and to forgive her of her sins (I strongly disagree with this). On the positive side, she did have some thought provoking statements that might be worth reading if you are in Children's ministry or are going to enter into it. Just don't buy the book for full price."
4,Solid Continuation Of the Buddy Series,"It's fascinating reading this book twenty years after it's been written, just to see how gay culture has changed over the last two decades, while many aspects, the pursuit of love and companionship for example, are exactly the same. Mordden is a wonderfully talented writer whose prose takes a bit getting used to at the start, as if you're reading Austin, Forster or Dickens. He also creates fiercely intelligent, witty, and culturally educated characters, so every chapter seems to be spouting off either a literary or operatic reference, or a musical playing on Broadway at the time. All this lends itself to a perfect time piece about being gay, growing older, and living life. Or as one character defends his argument to write it all down: ""If we write about what we did, and how we felt, who we were... we will leave something behind."""
4,A classic in Afican literature.,"This play was very entertaining. I understand it is required reading for many West African students, according to my friend from Burkina Faso.It is only 80 pages, but contains much depth. It can probably taken on many levels, especially if you're African, which I am not. It did after all win a Nobel Prize for Soyinka.The language of the first act is almost Shakesperian in nature, but does not represent the rest of the play. I found it humorous how the Yoruba spoke in metaphores and Shakesperian English while the British used modern English.While I believe the best way to sum up the play is ""culture clash"", Soyinka's notes in the front of the book deny that this is the central theme. The play to me also seems to shadow the abortion issue in the USA."
3,need some help!,Wole Soyinka's work is such a great one that I'm afraid I won't understand all. I need someone who study this author and who could give me some clues about Death and The King'Horseman!
5,A good intro to the work of this winner of Nobel Prize for Literature,"This is a definate must read. Written as a poetic play, Soyinka captures the Yoruba experience during the British occupation of Nigeria. It captures their perception of their colonizers, their religious ideologies in sharp contrast with that of the British, their political stance including about Yoruba persons who worked for the British at the time(hence, the mimic men/women) and their trauma and lamentations regarding the slave trade. The title refers to a specific issue that main protagonists will struggle with, leading to the Yoruba/British clash of religious and political ideologies. The result unveils the hypocracy of forced-conversion and explores issues of (in)humanity, suicide and freedom by examining each group's relationship with their leaders, their understanding of the divine God(s) and destiny. This book is one of the texts used in African literature classes."
2,A Vision Quest,A very difficult read. I have a Masters Degree and it stumped me. It appears to have been written on a level of masters of divinity or PhD. I have yet to unearth the meanings in the book. Very intellectual.
2,Not Many Solutions,"Based on the descriptions in the publisher's Web site, it seemed that someone had written a book that would not devour precious pages on bad puns and instead focus on using PSP to do real world applications. I bought the book and after finishing half of it, I must say there are precious few photo solutions in it with much of the book devoted to drawing vector objects (when was the last time I needed to draw a pear?) or rehashing basic material that was already well covered in the user's manual. I was disappointed but if you want to learn how to draw shapes and such using the vector tools, then this book just might be your cup of tea."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought with the title 'PSP 7 Solutions' and from the despcription by the Amazon Editor, this book would finally teach me how to use PSP 7. I could not have been more wrong. I have PSP 5 and PSP 6 and wanted to learn 7 because of all the new wonderful things I could do with graphics. Didn't happen!I make free web graphics for people to use on the interent and I wanted to learn to do some of the new 'fancy' things. I did not learn anything from this book and feel I wasted my money buying this book.If all you are looking for is a book that describes each and every tool and panel in great detail ... buy this book ... but if you are looking for 'how to' do things ... forget it!"
1,"Terrible, terrible product - for me at least.","I have been using Avery products for 8 years with nothing but great things to say about them, and particularly liked the old style 5660 labels, but these new ""easy peel"" ones have been an absolute nightmare. My office laser printer (a brand spankin new Kyocera 400ci) jams every single time I try to print on them. As a laser printer (which these labels are advertised for), it has a drum that heats up in order to print. Not a problem with the old labels, but the east peels literally shrink and melt from the mild heat, pulling the plastic from the paper and causing the 3 columns to separate. In the machine.At $49 a box, I would suggest anyone planning on using them at least test a sheet on their printer, because if your's is anything like mine you're going to be frustrated, angry, and out $49."
1,Labels smudged,I let the labels dry for hours and they still smudged when I was applying to envelopes. I have never had that problem with other clear labels.
3,Not the ones I asked for,"I requested you. I got the labels, but not the ones I asked for. I received 8460s. They are similar in size, but not exact. I had to move my data over in order to print correctly on the left side, which means that I wasted an entire sheet until I figured out the problem."
1,You don't know what you bought until you open and listen.,"I was very unhappy with the quality of the songs many of them were not sung by the original artist nor was quality of the sound very good the volume of the music would change in the middle of the song. Overall I was very, very, very unhappy with the album. If everything you sold was of this quality I would not be a customer very long.Thank you"
4,Awesome,"Animation was refreshing and the story was enjoyable. Although I must admit I not a fan of the series so I have no idea if it was close to the comic or not. I just came across the series and enjoyed itfrom start to finish. I only wish it was a bit longer, hence the 4 stars."
5,Deserved Top 10 Anime' of 2007!!!,"I am an Anime' fan and this is right up there with my top 10 favorite Anime' episodes and deserves the top ranks for Action, Adventure, Drama, Love & Romance. I haven't always been a Witchblade fan and did read up on the original comic books from Top Cow and find that the series in my book is original and very well thought out.I have already watched certain episodes more than once and plan on watching the entire series again as many times as time will allow!Lara Croft, eat your heart out! Love them both btw! But this is my most recent favorte!"
3,"Decent show, but...","Overall Witchblade is a pretty good show, but for some reason I really couldn't get into it. On average I really liked 1 out of every 2 or 3 episodes, but the other ones had me watching the clock constantly. I wanted to see more of Masane and her ""crew,"" more action, and MUCH less of the political/scientific perspective. Unfortunately every scene that didn't include either Masane, Rihoko, or Cho made my mind wander away from the show (and there are a lot)But who knows, maybe I just didn't ""get it"" and need to watch it again.If you are already a fan of the comic or manga, buy this.If you are a fan of action and fanservice, buy this.If you like anime that involve shady organizations, buy this.If you want a blu ray anime, buy this.The special features are probably the most extensive of any anime series I have ever seen. Very nice."
2,If you collected the comic book from TopCow/Image comics dont buy this. -Jult Warfell,Very disappointing. the series leaves you feeling like you wasted money watching this. It left you hanging. If you read the comic book you wont like this at all. The Japanese destroyed the concept and the idea of what Withblade was about. Michael Turner would be turning in his grave. Damn bastard died way to young.-Jult Warfell
3,Meh...,Some reviews are more thorough than mine but I'll just get to the point. I have a lot of anime and have seen a lot more. In my opinion you can't get anymore in the mid range rating than this. It's simply o.k. It's more fan service without nudity and mediocre fight scenes but the characters are all enjoyable. I bought the entire series and would rather have rented at a red box.Is it worth watching? Sure. Worth buying...nope.
3,Special,"The anime describes with fine details the relationship between a mother and a child.In one part, the story have just one weakness point difficult to accept.The screen is very good but sometimes, there are side-stepped lines.The heroin is often in the same jean and tee-shirt.Girls in little clothes.But, the show is beyond average. It lets a good souvenir.Very bad : on the second disc, impossible avoiding 2 minutes of Evangelion, so when you see ten episodes, one by one, you totalize 20 minutes of forced publicity.And, I appreciate kitchen and food but I see more and more anime, and they often talks ans talks about food, it becomes so boring. The first was XXXHolic. In Claymore, no food ...My top anime for the moment, from Funimation :1. Shigurui2. Basilisk3. Witchblade"
2,Average action and its plot blows.,"This anime has average action scenes, most of the episodes are loaded with filler, the main character dies at the end, the plot takes too long to develop and get to the good parts, bad writing destroys it, some of its character designs aren't good, its main character: Masane dies at the end and by the time this anime leads up to a cool antagonist, it ends up being a let down. This anime would've been a lot better if it was developed a lot better and if its issues were fixed. 4.5/10"
4,Witchblade: The Complete Series,"The Series was not particularly deep, but it was sexy and fun. It was pretty cool visually, with heavy innuendo (e.g., cleavage, crotch shots and the morning after scene) which led me to wonder about the intended audience. This could cause some adults to think twice about using this as a stocking stuffer.The storyline provided a relatively good time, providing just enough intrigue to keep the viewer wanting to know what lied ahead for our heroine. Kudos to Funimation for the presentation. If there were anything lacking (in my estimation), I'd say it would have been the lack of supplemental material typically offered with boxed sets. If you're a fan of the series or you enjoy scenes with scantily clad women, dispatching a variety of villainous types, this would definitely be worth purchase or a rental. At $57.00, the set is a bit pricey. A quick search on Amazon could save the potential buyer nearly half off the list price (if you don't mind used goods)."
5,Wickedly Awsome,"I give this anime series 10 stars if it would let me. This series rocks. Witchblade is so cool. It with this woman who has to fight to keep her daughter and she posesses this really cool power, (Witchblade). She transform when danger appears. This is movie is not ment for younger viewer due to violence. All I can say you have to buy this to see what I mean..."
5,Great anime,"To be honest I thought this anime was going to be nothing but fanservice, of course that would not of stop me from liking it. I was pleasantly surprised that the story was pretty good and had quite a lot of humor. The series was quite enjoyable."
5,Heart-breaking!,"Carl Desportes Bowman tells it like it was in his account of the decline and acculturation of the Church of the Brethren, the formerly conservative wing of the Brethren Movement.It's readable, enjoyable, but on the whole a very sad story."
1,A proper name : Statistics summary and question collection,"Received this book and decided to return it immediately.There are 39 chapters in this 357-page book. So you get less than 10 page per chapter. For each chapter, there are average 4-5 pages of question with blanks for your answers!I am looking for a book with solid statistical concepts with corresponding S-plus scripts, not summaries and questions. This book will be good for a statistical teacher looking for a question book."
2,Nonfunctional,The ball stud was not properly threaded at the factory. Will not function unless I use a die on it myself. For 25 bucks you'd think it wouldn't make it through the QA stage!
5,Great Product!,Have installed several of these shelves at my summer home. Great design and easy to install with mounting holes being set for various wall stud configurations. Will buy again if I find another place for additional.
4,Perfect Presentation of Hanukkah,"The Hanukkah story is told in terms accessible to young children without the horror of hate being left out. This is an inclusive book, serving not only as a simple counting book (necessarily only to #8) but also covering the traditions of the holiday-family involvement, gift giving, tzedakah (charity)- and the rules of the dreidel game as well. The foil flames highlight the miracle of the oil and the illustrations make, even to the non-Jew, the holiday seem warm and familiar.This book well-serves as a good introduction of a celebration of freedom for any young child."
2,Not what I needed,"I ordedred 2 of these at the same time. One was inoperable when I received it as it would not charge. I wanted something I could use continuously while hunting at night. These lights are only capable of 2 minute bursts of light when the red lense is on. After 2 minutes the light nust be turned off to cool,otherwise the lense could be damaged.The lights are also very heavy so even if they could be used for extended periods of time, they would become awkward.The shipper was excellent and accomodated my return in a prompt and professional manner."
3,A Bunch of Quotes,"I suppose this is an o.k. book for anyone wanting a general encyclopedia-type reference book of quotes from the world's most ""popular"" spiritual writers. There is nothing overtly bad about it, and the hard cover looks nice. The index of the writers that the quotes were taken from also contains a brief description of who they were, which was perhaps the most interesting and useful parts of the book. Many of the quotes the editors chose to include were in my opinion, not really worth the paper, but I guess they wanted to put together a thick book. There is a bit of 'wisdom' contained in the book, but if you took all the good quotes, the book could have been half the size. Overall, a good reference book for popular (yet often redundant) spiritual sayings. Better off to read entire works to gain any real insight though; like the Dhammapada, Tao Te Ching, or if you're feeling extra ambitious, try War And Peace."
3,Beautiful product - but made in China,"I recently order two Soup and Sandwich sets. The product arrived in very good condition; both have the ""Sweet pea"" pattern and the soup cup is quite large-haven't measured, but it probably holds a pint or more. A delightful addition to my Portmerion collection, the reason why I am only giving three stars is that the boxes were marked ""Made in China"". A major reason that I buy Portmerion is that most of the products are made in Britain."
4,Really cute,"The tray and cup are very pretty, even though they aren't the traditional Portmeirion as they are made in china. I would say that it is disappointing but they seem to be just as good and are affordable."
5,Very Soulful,Ray Charles is a Timeless Artist.his music is it's own style.these songs are just simply Great.you can't put a Label on them.His voice is very SOulful&to the point.I Can't Stop Loving You is a Classic that will never Be FOrgotten.as is the case with the other songs on this Disc.
2,Skip this book,"This is the shallow story of a few intelligent students that will do anything to make it onto the prestigious University of Chicago Law Review. The only thing this book does correctly is show how competitive law school really is. I must also give the author credit for his writing ability, but I also think he added too much unnecessary sex. Bottom line: If you're interested in reading something that will prepare you for law school, don't read this book. There are much better books out there."
3,"not bad, but fails to deliver in the end","The setup is interesting (if you are into law school and manipulative competition), but the ending was not particularly satisfying."
2,The Law Review,"After reading this book, it was hard to believe that the staffing of a law school publication was less on merit and more on influence. That Supreme Court Clerks are selected from a pool of Law Review hierarchy rather than due to academic achievement. Unless being an Editor of a Law Review publication is in of itself a measure of accomplishment. The author was on the staff of a Law Review publication which would indicate that there is a kernal of truth to this premise. Then there is the concept of ""getting away with murder"" that is difficult to digest. Although one who is familiar with the law can use it to manipulate their innocence. I don't agree with the morality, it is a good and easy read."
4,Stumbling Toward Faith: Graphic and Real,"This nonfiction, true account is quite graphic. I read of a woman's struggle to resolve physical and verbal (emotional/mental) abuse delivered in God's name. She's trying to live to be good enough for everyone around her, better than her poisoned past and perfect for a exacting god. She covers the search for acceptance that many of us feel and hope we will find in the name of a god and its people. The real sense of an individual comes through in an almost diarist format. Many of the revelations the author reaches, though she's still searching, resonate with me."
2,I feel bad but...,"I know I'm the bad guy for not liking this book but.. I just didn't! Not because I didn't like the author, but because the author didn't allow me to get to know her. This book contains the kind of writing that happens when you are lying in bed crying and having a big therapeutic pity party. Which is fine, Renee Altson more than deserves a big pity party, but.. I just don't think it makes for a really good read.I wanted to get to know the characters, I wanted to know her father, the associate pastor who hurt her so much, her mother, her siblings, etc. But she didn't really ever introduce them. The only thing I got where little snippets about the bad things that they did.I think that if in a few years Renee Altson decides to really sit down and tell her story, I will definitely read the book, because there is a lot of great material here. But for now.. reading this book was like being asked to read a depressed friend's diary. Not much to dive into."
4,"My 7 year old never stops ""driving"" on my computer!","The V3 racing wheel is a good value. The disk that comes with it say Windows 95 but it DOES work in 98. Click ""Add/Remove Hardware""icon (in Control Panel)and let the Wizard from 98 install it. It will say when installation is complete. You can check this by clicking on ""Game Controllers"" icon and you will see that it is connected and working properly. A newer 98 driver disk from the company would have been nice..."
3,"Nice, but very Expensive for the weight!","When I viewed this on line and read the description, I expected a bracelet that felt heavier.I recently purchased an equally good looking, actually better, sterling men's bracelet twice the weight of this one on eBay for half the price of this one."
2,Safire should stick to non-fiction,This book definitely is not in the same league as others in its genre. I found it to be predictable and somewhat boring. There was no evident chemistry between that main characters but they somehow get together in the end.
4,This book was OK,"I just finish this book and it was pretty entertaining. But I think that in some areas that were to confusing, it seemed like the whole objective of Mr. Safire is to misdirect the reader and not sticking with the plot. I think the main problem that this book has is too many character. If the book just concentrated on a couple of characters it would be a lot better."
1,henry.delinois@hmrag.com,"Weaving an engaging and capitivating spy story may require an extraordinary effort for many -- especially if the story tries to take you on a ""good ride,"" by offering believable characters with substance, and a compelling plot. Safire starts with a wonderful concept -- finding a deeply burried spy (a compelling concept.) He did get my attention.Regretably after reading the first 150 pages, and even with a compelling concept, I was unable to complete the book. The main characters were predictable and lacking of any depth, and the dialogue cache if not contrived. Perhaps,if the predicatability of the dialogue and characters could have been overlooked, Safire may have told an wonderfully interesting story. Unfortunately, I wasnt able to come to this conclusion since I couldn't take it any more after the first 150 pages."
1,Rip Off!,"Wow, this article sucks. It basically told me everything about the book that I already knew. Biggest waste of six bucks in the history of money wasting. The stupid thing didn't even mention any useful quotes or anything whatsoever that would help me with my research paper. Do yourself a favor and just navigate away from this page.I'm sorry I couldn't give this item zero stars. . ."
5,A lot of sound for the money,"These speakers have fantastic sound for the price. After tiring of the tin-like, distorted sound of the standard speakers that came with my computer, I decided to invest in some different speakers. Though I've only had these for a day, they are already proving that they're worth the money.The setup is easy for these speakers. The 3 wires are color-coded, and an AC adapter is included. Granted, it's easy to get all those long cords tangled, but what do you expect for speakers?The speakers have incredible bass quality, and the subwoofer really adds to this. I have the subwoofer on a shelf close to the floor next to my computer, and it really works great! All of my music has a nice rounded bass sound now. Just as a test, I tried cranking these speakers to the maximum volume, and there was little, if any, distortion.These speakers really pack a punch for the size, and for the price, how can you go wrong?"
3,covers an area ignored by other novelists,"Mr. Kluge has written many novels but thisis apparently the first in this area. It concernsthe relationship between a journalist and thewhite officers and black enlisted men of the25th Cavalry from fighting the Apaches inArizona to the Spanish-American War inthe Philippines.African-American military fiction is rare and thisis a good ""read."" I know at least one characterthat of an angry black officer who defects tothe Filipino side is based on an actual historicalperson"
1,THIS TOY SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVES!!,My 5 year old daughter wanted it for Christmas so bad I got it for her. It worked once (about 3 strands of candy) and quit. I returned it and got another. It worked twice and stopped dead. It went back to the store also. We wound up getting a chocolate maker. The cotton candy maker is a piece of junk and should not be sold. The manufacturer should be ashamed of themselves for disappointing thousands of children. This is not an inexpensive toy either ($..). Shame on them!!!!
1,WORST TOY EVER!,"this is a really bad toy. first of all, when you first get it it takes several hours to charge. second, when its finally done charging, you make the cotton candy that takes long too. when the cotton candy is finally done, there's like nothing in it and it doesn't even taste like cotton candy. so, if you're looking for a great toy for making good cotton candy that's worth the money, DON'T BUY THIS! i repeat DON'T BUY THIS!"
2,bad design!,"The product is hard to use because of it's design, will not operate unless lid of machine is on correctly, the rotating head is not overloaded with sugar, must waite 10-seconds after 30-seconds of running, battery consumption (4-""AA"") high (will not operate unless battery power is at a high level), the elec. trans former burned out the first time used, and hard to clean up(can not get water on elec. wash with damp towel witch is impossible). If head cloggs w/sugar it will not operate, can not wash with water (not sure how to clean, no instructions)."
2,Not what I expected but O.K.,"This cotton candy machine is o.k. if you don't mind refilling it each time you run it for a cycle (which means having to take the lid off each time it needs refilled). Also the amount of cotton candy that is dispensed in each cycle is not worth it. You can purchase other machines on internet for just [price] more which are much better than this one. But none-the-less, it gave no technical problems other than the LED (red) light not working."
1,Poor Quality Cotton Candy Machine,"This cotton candy machine was used once and then it stopped working. We've returned it several times, the same thing keeps happening. We are NOT doing anything wrong. It is just made poorly. My advice, save your money! Buy a real cotton candy machine, you're better off! And your child won't get mad at you for getting them a shotty gift!"
1,this toy stinks,this is the worst toy that i got on christmas. Sure it worked the first day but then it stoped. It broke the secound day. Well in the one day i had it i realized it made only a little amount you couldnt even tell you were eating anything! I advise you to not get this toy for christmas!!!!!!!
1,Are they kidding?,"Having 1 daughter, 4 nieces, a godson and his 3 brothers, I thought wow.....what a great idea.I have since thought my judgement to be impaired.This product is AWFUL.It doesn't work correctly first of all. You can follow the directions many times and it won't make a difference. When you finally get the machine to turn itself on, you need to hold down the button or the contraption will freeze up. It does make SOMETHING.....a LITTLE like cotton candy, but only makes enough for a tiny taste. I used the fine household suger as it suggests and low and behold you could still crunch the sugar crystals.It is an awful product full of dissappointment for me and all the kids. Not worth the time, money or sad faces. Go to the store and buy it pre-made.....it is expensive but definately worth it."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"Bought this machine for Christmas and it was the worst product ever! We didn't get much cotton candy from it and didn't even make it through the 4 tiny containers of sugar before the machine stopped functioning correctly. I am not sure how the others work (like the Salton maker) but I would sure put my money on that first! You might spend a little bit more, but after all, you get what you pay for!!! What a terrible disappointment this one was."
1,Waste of money,"My daughter was excited to get her own cotton candy maker, but I spent more time changing batteries, hitting the reset button and making the top stay on to make the machine work. It does not make a lot of candy and for 30 seconds worth of spinning, I feel it was a waste of my money."
3,made the kids cry,"The cotton machine was the best present of the year. My daughter was so excited. The machine worked maybe three times, we had all the sugar crystals and everything,since we had only had the machine a couple of weeks we retuned it to the store.but since it was after x-mas the store was out of stock. We did get another one but needless to say the same thing happened, it only worked a couple of times. Our daughter asks all the time if we can get another and now we cant find another one nor do we want to spend the money on something that does not work. Just thought you should know that we are all so very dissapointed in this product. Gene Green"
3,review,This item does not hold up well. It overheats quickly and you can only make 1 to 2 cycles at a time before it shuts down. The kids love the machine however become very agitated when they only get one taste before we have to let it rest.
1,try this one,"For anyone looking for a cottom candy machine that DOES work - try The Real Cotton Candy Machine from Rose Art - comes almost completely assembled, is easy to clean, and best of all - it makes cotton candy! Mind you, you won't get a huge volume unless you spend some time, but my 6 year old loves it and we have no complaints. It does not come with any mix, so make sure to get some, but we did use regular sugar and it worked fine, it just wasn't as tasty!"
2,Louise,"Many points were missing which the movie did not document according to the bible. Moses did not enter the promise land because he did not obey God when he struck the rock twice for water. Also, Saul did not obey God`s orders to kill a king and everything in the city. Furthermore, the tribes were separated after Solomon`s death and his son attempted to place pressure on the tribes. Three tribes went back to holy land, Jerusalem, and nine went with Ephriam and later they were sold into slavery. This is mentioned in Deuteronomy where if the children of Israel did not obey and teach the Word of God, they would be punished, which race is still in capacity lockup and are dealt with harder punishments? This race could be found in every prison houses throughout the United States especially the men."
1,Kingdom of David,"This documentary is so bias and terribly false that I could not stand to watch an hour's worth of it.If you are looking to learn truth, this is not it, please don't waste your time; a small child could have done a better documentation. I can't believe I wasted my money to purchase this.Its very sad...Terrible, terrible and terribleIts not even worth the one star I gave."
2,Disapointing Subjectiveness,This piece did have some viable history and good dating on Jerusalem. Disappointing on the numerous subjective points. Obviously the people that put his together are atheists. When Moses freed Israel from Egypt and wondered through the desert it was not the desert that supported the people it was God. Moses wrote the Pentateuch not scribes in exile.
5,Gets the job done...,I bought these needing hex bits and they certainly do the job. I am quite happy with them and I've added them to my collection of dewalt tools.
4,Interesting Perspective,"This book presents a series of papers (technical and philosophical) on an approach to AI (specifically, robotics), that basically denies the need for the existence of a 'cognition' system. I like this approach because of it's simplicity, and it's philosophical implications. To the reader that was expecting a book on the history of AI: Yes, the title could be read like that, but I think the intent was to say ""This is the history of a new way of looking at things"", not ""This is the early history of the entire field of AI"""
4,Good thought-provoking material,"While the title is a bit misleading (this is not a history per se, so much as a collection of papers of historical interest), this book contains a wealth of good material for those researching behavior-based robotics. As the book is a collection of Brooks' papers on the subject, it gives good insights into his approach -- although it does include a significant amount of redundant text (as you'd expect, many of the papers share ""boilerplate"" treatments of some subject matter).Still, ""Cambrian Intelligence"" is both thought-provoking (to those primarily acquainted with ""classical"" AI approaches), and well worth the price tag -- if only for the convenience factor (vs. rounding up and printing out all the included papers)."

2,With companions like this....,"This book provides an essay for each book of Augustine's Confessions. But the essays make a very troublesome ""companion"" for a reader. Shouldn't the writing be at least as clear and precise as the book it is supposedly providing a guide to? Here's a sample from the first essay, on Augustine's first chapter, by Charles T. Mathewes:""Rather than seeking to comprehend our lives better, Augustine hopes his readers will more appropriately fail to comprehend them; and insofar as one fails to fail to comprehend in the right way, one is blocked from understanding the deep character of what the Confessions is all about. . . . What do I mean by this?""Beats the hell out of me.Leaving aside the trouble of the dangling participial clause the sentence opens with, I would find this writing laughable, were it not so needlessly dense and inexcusably condescending to the reader. With companions like this, the reader needs no enemies. Augustine and his great book deserve better."
1,This CD should be stuck in a horses bum for wiping purposes.,"This may be the worst CD that I have heard in my life. The only band that is as bad as Jetboy is Boston. The singer of Jetboy and Brad Delp should be banned because they have Trace Kolling-like stench. Jetboy, nice name for a band by the way."
1,Words cannot describe how much I hate this product,"I think the name of this product ""featherlite"" was an inside joke between engineers/designers, who put this machine together at Dirt Devil. I don't believe the people who think this product is ""light"" and I are from the same planet. This vacuum feels and sounds more like a lawnmower than something you would use indoors. It doesn't suck well. It stinks up the apartment. The Miele vacuum of my mom's from early 1980s does a better job in every aspect possible. It is also SO big that it requires as large a closet space as most NYC apt. can have. I can't wait to toss it."
2,Dirt Devil Featherlite: Hose adapter to base unit easily cracks,"Good buy for the price, but the hose adapter to the base unit easily cracks. The adapter is so flimsy and is weakened from holes for the latching, that it cracks after few uses and then pieces fall off so that it can't retain the connection during use."
3,Its International politics,Not sure how exciting it can be. It is is alright. It was a needed text book for school and it does the job.
3,int. relations. good but limited,"I recently bought this book. Its content rocks!! Nonetheless its support website requires some access code that the book DOES NOT include. I contacted several times the editirial company, via chat help and email, and all they do is blame amazon.com for the ""loss"" of the code. Bottom line is I CANNOT use the support material on the website. Personally, i blame the editorial company for obstaculizing the appropriate use of this resource."
4,IR for Beginners,This book is very straightforward and ideal for an introductory Political Science course at the college level. Definitions are in bold letters and Goldstein allows readers to follow along with ease.
2,Where's the beef?,"Same old growing info, nothing about marketing plants or about preserving the enviorment. Its promotions state a enviormental friendly book, could not figure this one out , it seems to have used this to promote this well written book,. Note-- one magazine ad says, this companys name is the Enviormental Press, ( REAL NAME Admire Press) but not one metion of the enviorment in this book. Lots of the same growing info found in library, no good greenhouse pictures, all seem to be 20 years old."
3,Cryptic Instructions & Dimensionally Challenged,"This is a good product but there were several problems. First, the directions are evidently designed so that it can be used by people of different languages. There are no words, only cryptic symbols, colors, and diagrams. It is not clear - for any language. Second, if you have limitations on how high the unit can sit vertically, you need to be careful. I needed this to be at the minimum height, but when I set it up this way and put my monitor on it (iMac), it sagged so much that it scraped on the keyboard. I tried to add one of the spacers, but that made it too high for my application. The only way that I could get it to work was to hacksaw the four spacers in order to make it fit. Again, this is a good product, but it was not well thought out by the manufacturer."
4,Fits 2 monitors easily,"I needed something that could fit 2 monitors, and this did it. The first one that I received was faulty, but I was able to exchange it for a working one."
3,"Wherever there's Lobo, there's mayhem","Lobo gets unexpectedly fragged by one of the criminals he's hunting and his soul journeys from Heaven to Hell. As expected, ultra-violence follows. This book has absolutely no pretensions or philosophical musings on the impact of violence on society. It's just good, sick, gory fun. There are some laugh out moments as you would expect from the Main Man. This book is rated mainly on sheer entertainment, no points for relevance or breaking new ground in literature (as if). The reason why it didn't get the perfect score (in Lobo standards) is the art. It may not be the fault of DC to have two artists in this book (Simon Bisley, the quintessential Lobo artist, failed to meet deadlines or some other reason and DC was forced to replace him midway in the series), it's just that Bisley's replacement artist, suffers in comparison to the man who defined the Lobo look. But if you could look past it, it's a nice read."
3,Overall Disappointment,If I could I would give this book 2 1/2 stars as opposed to three since I feel that the first half of the book was truly entertaining and funny. Then the bomb drops and the second half is just plain disgusting.
2,Where's my review?,"Well, I wrote a scathing review of this book, but it didn't show up here. I gave it two stars because I finished it one sitting, now I'm giving it only one, because I don't want to have to write this whole thing over again."
5,Extremely Well Done,"The Sugar Daddy Swing Kings come swinging to us from San Luis Obispo, CA., where they are making a name for themselves there, and in other parts of California. This eight member band puts together a great first album with ""How BIG Can You Get."" The album features mainly original works by George Stone, a very talented writer and musician. There is simply not enough praise for the work that Stone turns out. The album swings out great tunes and makes you want to get up and dance. The lyrics, written and sung by frontman Paul Brown, are fun and light. The band has a great and memorable sound. SDSK displays real talent in this work and should be recognized and appreciated. The album will appeal to new swing listeners or those who put on their dancing shoes at clubs. The Sugar Daddy Swing Kings are recommended to anyone who appreciates and likes good dancing swing music. Be sure to check them out--you won't be sorry."
5,exactly as advertised!,This small bedside table was a perfect match/blend of woodtones next to a new guest bed. A small lamp and alarm clockfit nicely on top of it and the drawer is just right to holdsmall items (eyeglasses etc) out of the way.The price was great. Directions were totally easyto follow for quick minimum assembly.Everything about it was exactly as advertised!
2,Lack of depth but somewhat good overview,"This is somewhat a good overview of a particular way to attack the multi-sensor fusion problem. The authors always refer and somtimes present their own work on the subject.However, this book gathers different parts of reference publications (which I did not have access to) and was misleading. For example, some algorithms were not fully explained and therefore hard to reproduce.If you are looking for a thorough explanation of the key concepts, this is not the book because it presents three solutions, focusing on the authors'."
4,Great Snack,"Great snack - healthier version of the ""other"" cheddar snacks on the market. Like the packaging and you get a good amount for your money. Great for my son's school lunch."
2,Too salty,"I got these for snacks for myself and my toddler. I wouldn't order them again, however, as they are very very salty!"
5,Yummy snack for the kids!,"Both of my picky eaters like this snack and I always leave a few bags in the glove compartment for times when we need a quick, healthy snack. It really beats some of the other snacks out there!"
3,"Good, but a little bland.","These are good enough to eat, but they lack the cheese-y flavor that other cheddar crackers have. Definitely not Cheez-its flavor-wise, but these crackers are at least all natural AND lower in fat and calories than Cheez-its.In short, they're fine to eat, but don't think you're getting the same taste as Cheez-its. Also, the expiration month isn't that far from purchase date. Bought mine end of April 2010 and the expiration is July 2010. Something to take into consideration when you're buying such a large quantity of these (make sure you have enough people to eat them up :). If all else fails, we can always use these for 'snack duty' with soccer games or scouts."
4,major w,"Stuart Bull: I recently learned of Stuart Bull guitar series although I am sure of the other instructional DVDs. But my all time favorite guitarist is Larry Carlton and his award winning slow blues/jazz style. Stuart uses one of Larry's songs named ""The B.P. Blues"" so called in admiration for the California club where regularly performed during the late `80s--The Baked Potato. Bull's division of instruction is just right for those of us who are interested in this style of expression. There is also a backing track included to put learned sections to full use. Of course, there are some riffs that only Larry does that are his own signature. But the goal in guitar playing is to develop one's own style and not note-by-note copying. As a performing artist, it is fun to see the audience responding to your admiration of a well known, Grammy award winning guitarist. Have fun."
4,Another good one,"I love the Tiller Galloway novels. Some of Poyers other stuff doesnt do it for me, but the Tiller novels really have a great feel for the water and diving. Love them all."
1,Caution,"I originally gave this ring an excellent review. My fiancee bought me this ring @ 1 year ago. I loved it. Then, suddenly the stone fell out. I tried to contact the company, sending them several emails which were never replied to. Yesterday I took the ring into a business that repairs jewelry and they told me 3 of the 4 prongs of this ring were garbage. My stone had been held in essentially by one prong. To repair my ring was estimated at 300 dollars!!!! Do not waste your money on this ring. I loved it, but now i am left with a stone and an empty setting...not what I expected!"
3,Missing a no-holes tray!,"Love the book and the Prime Shipping, but the kit had 4 trays with holes. I expected to get a no holes tray, but the listing doesn't say it had one, so that's my fault. Now I have to go out and get one at my local nursery. I also got the book cover pictured in the listing for [...] 5/seeds, 5/trays and their single bag of dirt, not the separate peat and vermiculite mentioned in this listing. Ordering from a company with affiliates gets confusing, but this will work in the end. Looking forward to my 1st harvest!"
2,Horrible Mix,The same as previous reviews...great album-forget the quad mix. Wait for the remaster or get the american or english vinyl.
2,Nektar album issued by Ballaphon using the wrong masters.,"This Nektar album is at best a curiosity. When Bellaphon reissued the Nektar catalogue on CD, they accidentally used a flawed master tape in which the keyboards phased out the guitars. The album was remastered before the vinyl was issued, but now, years later, the mistake has resurfaced. A more faithful version of Remember the Future is set to be released."
4,Someone forgot the Lead Guitar!,"I've heard this CD & wondered what happened to all the lead guitar parts? I'm very familiar with the original version of this album...one of my all-time favorites & the guitar is GONE!I've checked one of the Nektar websites & the CD was remastered with the wrong tapes.If you've never heard the original version, you'd never know the difference & is still very enjoyable, but for those of us who know it well, this is not an acceptable representation of a great album. Look for the newer one with the two bonus tracks: ""Loney Roads & Let It Grow"" radio edits. That remastered version is the original album with the proper tapes used."
3,"This CD is NOT the original master, but still a classic.","The original Remember The Future is one of the greatest progressive rock classics of all time, in my humble opinion. It happens to be my all-time, #1 favorite, of any group. For the rock lover, it has everything: slow parts, fast parts, melodic segments, soft passages, and in the best of Nektar tradition, hard driving parts. Arguably, this was Nektar at their musical pinnacle. The caveat? This CD was NOT produced from the original master copy the album was recorded from. The group has all hopes of releasing this again and should eventually. But that should not deter the average rock music lover from picking this up. Just be aware it is not the original which was released. It is only another flavor of the same great album. If/when the original is redone, it will be worth the effort to also obtain."
2,"Man, oh Man","Yeah, I used to lay around all day listening to this album in the 70s. In looking at it now (I still have the side but haven't got the courage to listen to it), I would say it probably bites. Can't say I've heard the CD, but I can say what a strange place this rock we're living on, is."
2,Doesn't stand the test of time,"Somehow my brother and I got our grubby mits on this album when we were about 13 or 14 and we loved it. We listened to it over and over on a junky little record player. However (aplogies to all I offend), at 51 years old I find the music repetative and juvenile. Sorry. There are 2 or 3 minutes of good stuff, but overall I think I wasted my money trying to relive the past."
1,Gung Ho to purchase -dismayed by reviews!,Rememer the Future has a lot of great memories for me - the music being progressive and constant - telling a story. I so wanted to purchase the CD to add to my classic collection and was upset by what I read in the reviews and the re-mastered problems...I can only hope that this will be rectified with the correct mix. Until then I will just get by. :)
3,Messed-up mix,"The music on this cd is some of the finest progressive rock ever recorded, to bad the music company screwed up the mix!! Where are the guitars? I want to turn my friends on to this but I won't do it until I get a properly mixed cd, which is too bad because this music needs to be heard. C'mon Bellaphon!! Get it done!!"
5,"Nektar ""Remember The Future""","I purchased this for a friend and he was happy with it. no complaints. Thank You, Dawn Beckett"
4,Irresponsible mastering,"The mastering to CD was done using the quadrophonic mix. (For those of you under the age of 40, quad was a brief fling with 4-speaker-surround-sound.) The engineer failed to realize this and only used two of the four channels. So huge swaths of Roye Albrighton's remarkable guitaristry sound like they are occuring in a room down the hall. Particularly tragic because this album has the most magical guitar arpeggios I've ever heard in rock music. Unbelievable that the engineer didn't even notice; unbelievable that this has been common knowledge for over half a decade and the label still hasn't been shamed into correcting it."
2,remaster on the way,"The original CD is flawed version of a great album and was apparently taken from the wrong tape. If you've heard the LP, you'll be greatly disappointed. The good news is a remastered CD, said to be faithful to the original record, is due for release by the band in June, 2002. My advice: wait for the reissue."
5,Finally!,"I am glad to see this great album remastered the right way and with two new tracks! I'm a huge fan of Nektar, and people will actually get to hear what Nektar sounded like on vinyl but with CD quality. Remember the Future is great as always, and I would recommend this album to anybody who likes progressive rock of the seventies."
3,Word from the band,"Loved the LP, hated the CD, then found this quote from Roye Albrighton (lead guitarist), found on a Nektar tribute page <http://homepages.go.com/~cnektar2/index.html>""This album was eventually mixed in quadraphonic stereo, because, many people of my age will now tell you, that was supposed to be the new thing.... But only 0.1% of the population knew what qaud sound was, and to top it all, three different systems were available. So which system do you mix or cut for... Luckily we did a bog standard stereo mix which is what can be heard to this day."""
5,The finest rock music ever composed,"For roughly twenty years, my favorite album was Jethro Tull's ""Thick as a Brick"". Then I heard ""Remember the Future"", and that was it. This album is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Anybody who enjoys inventive, progressive rock music will love it. It's not too weird (Magma) or too mechanical (King Crimson)."
4,Nektar CD - Remember The Future,"I have been waiting for many years to locate this on CD and I'm thrilled to get it and am very satisfied with the quality. The band has a sound unique to a particular era. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but for a fan like myself, it's an essential piece of my music collection."
3,"Okay, but not great","There's plenty of South Park humor to keep you interested, but the controls are loose, it's hard to navigate through levels, and the graphics are average. On the plus side, there are plenty of hidden tracks and racers to unlock, and the multiplayer mode is fun. My advice:rent before buying."
2,big dissapointment,the unlockable costumes and hidden characters are cool but many of the levels are impossible to beat. also once you run out of money ur screwed. I would recomend this to no one and hope that they just buy someting else for their 64. Even hardcore south park fans will be dissapointed.
3,Southpark is fun mmmkay!,If you aren't a huge Southpark fan then this game is a waste of money.It has a ton of references to the show and lots of funny one liners.Outside of that it's just a plain old racing game with profanity.
4,Watch OVA Before Season 2,"I know it has been mentioned here on a few occasions, and naturally I like most I would imagine watched season 2 first and then the OVA. They could have done a much better job just by putting the OVA on the first disk to start with. As for the story, I'll let you judge it for yourself, I personally enjoyed the story, I just would have preferred to see it chronologically"
5,Best Anime series!!,"I love Darker than Black, it is an amazing series filled with funny moments, philosophical, action, and great characters!! I can't wait to get this!! I support Darker than Black and i hope with season 2 sales there might be a season 3!!!!"
4,Good show but watch OVA's first,"Make sure to watch the OVA's first, the second season will not make sense without it. Pretty sure thats where many of the iffy reviews came from after watching it.Really liked the OVA'S, they are the same style as Season 1.Season 2 was ok until around the last episode. I must be missing something watching the english dub because most of the last episode makes little sense. About the only other gripe is the transform scene she keeps doing which does not fit with how contractors work in the series. Makes the second season look like they tried to gear it for little kids or tweens. Honestly it is like the show was written by a different group. First couple episodes are almost the generic ""coming of age"" type.If you already have the first season I would recommend picking it up for the OVA's if nothing else. The box is oversized to hold season 1 as well. If you don't have season 1 I would recommend netflix."
4,"Don't listen to the haters, give it a shot.","I would have to say that I am one of the few people that like this season better then the first. With ""Bones"" handling the animation work(Wolf`s Rain, Soul Eater, Eureka Seven, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) you know the animation is going to be top notch.This season comes chronologically after the frist, but, there are events that took place during the two seasons that you aren't going to find out till you watch the 4 OVA's that come w/ this season(even then there are still lot's of answered questions, but at least you don't have to wait as long as those of us who followed the fan subs of the series.) A lot of people complain about this season not answering questions from the first, but it is a geat setup for the 3rd season.Lot's of character development, wonderfully animated fight scenes, and I would have to say that it is a very emotional season. Much more so then the first.Be sure to watch -Darker Than Black: The Complete First Season"
5,Christmas present,I bought this as a give for my grandson. One that he picked out himself. He seemed very happy when he got it.
4,Good,Not going to lie its not as good as the first season im not going to say it sucked it is still worth it if you are a fan of darker than black the ova was sweet I loved the fights in it
5,Make Kahuna Power work for you,"Kahuna Power offers the reader an opportunity to vicariously experience a spiritual adventure that follows the authors--Timothy Green Beckley, veteran paranormal researcher, and psychics Maria Carta, and Penny Melis--as they gain the trust of native Hawaiian healers, priests, and practitioners of the true magic to be found in the ancient psycho-religious system of Huna. If you are prepared to follow the path of the Kahuna, you will discover, as did our authors, the power to enrich your life, increase your well-being, and foresee your future. Brad Steiger, author of Kahuna Magic; Sherry Steiger, author of Indian Wisdom and Its Guiding Power."
5,THIS ALBUM ROX!!!!,"Woooooaw was I in for a spank when I put this CD in my CD-player. It absolutely spanked..And my boyfriend (Mike Wilson) adored it too. It has been since Bronski Beat and ""Smalltown boy"" that I've heard such [awsome] tunes. And [man]AN EXCITING COVER!!!!!! It got me all turned on...An absolute must-have for amusing piyama-parties with your... friends."
1,Crappy Product,The battery was dead when I received the phone so I was not able to use it and it was a waste of my money.
4,"Great phone, dead battery","This was an in-kind replacement for a handset that got dropped on the floor one too many times, so I knew what I was getting. It met all my expectations, except that the battery that came with it would not charge. I replaced the battery with the one from the old handset, and now everything works fine."
2,AT&T E597-1 - 5.8 GHz Expansion Handset,"Handset arrived from ANTOnline with dead battery, AT&T replaced the battery. Phone does not maintain connection to base which is downstairs(1st floor)approximately 30' away."
1,Have Not used the item,I can not say anything about this item because it was not what I wanted. I bought this by mistake and I have not use it yet.
1,phones won't register,"These phones were brand new, however they would not register with our existing system. We will have to send them back."
2,Base for this phone non existent.,"Base for this phone non existent. Looks like a great phone but,with the non production of compatible base units; it is worthless.I'm glad that I didn't waste any more money."
5,Cordless phone assessment,"We are very pleased with the phone and its operation. It has very good range, is user friendly, and the intercom works great!! Also, the reception is very clear."
1,Worst handset ever invented!!,"I am a usability engineer for websites. This has got to be the worst design I have ever seen in a phone. If you tilt your head the wrong way, it hangs up on the person you are talking to. The design of it is so terrible because of the location of the off button and also how touchy the button itself is. I definitely would not recommend this phone to anyone. It will embarass you during phone conversations because you will have to call people back because you will constantly be hanging up on them."
1,battery dead and unchargeable - waste of time,"I should have listened to the minority of reviewers who said that the phone arrived with a dead battery, and could not be charged, when they received the phone. Mine too was useless. It seems to be a standard problem with this unit. Amazon cannot exchange the item, only refund it, so I have to start the whole process again, with another phone. What a waste of time and effort. Don't bother with this phone."
2,stainless steel shouldn't rust!!!!,"I have a Polder strainer similar to this one.Although I love the design & space,it is rusting.Mind you they are not cheap!!I called them & was told that stainless steel does not rust.I told her that it must not be stainless steel,because it is rusting.She said that no one has ever complained.I find that hard to believe.I would have had to mail it to them.Then had to buy a new one anyway.Quite frankly,save your money!!"
1,"""Stainless Steel"" Is Very Poor Quality","I like the design of this dish rack, but I question whether it is actually made of 18/8 stainless steel. Unlike mild steel, stainless steel should not rust. I purchased this dish rack on 4 September, but it began showing surface rust within a month of normal use as a dish rack. A couple of days ago, one of the spot welds on a corner of the utensil holder broke revealing rust inside the corner seam. I wonder whether Polder actually verifies that the Chinese manufacturer of this dish rack actually uses 18/8 stainless steel. I plan to ask for a full refund of this defective product."
1,Stainless steel ?? Don't be fooled !,"What a disappointment !! I bought this nice looking dish rack, expecting it to last much longer than the ones sold at general stores. Due to its high price (about 4 times the other dish racks), I persuaded myself that it must be of high quality. Soon after using, signs of rust started to show, and so did my disatisfaction towards Polar products. High price does not always equate high quality."
3,stylish and space saving,"I like this drainer. It holds a lot and keeps water from spilling out on my counter from the drying dishes. One drawback: I have to remember to dump the water from the tray, or it gets kind of scummy. It's also a little tricky to wash the drainer, but not so much so as to turn me off.Polder KTH-6112 Two-Tier Dish Rack System, Stainless Steel"
5,A great product!,"Twinlab Ultra CoQ10 capsules are simply the best. Pure CoQ10 that's easy to swallow. Pricey but worth it.Note: Most of the world's CoQ10 is made in Japan. The pure stuff is bright, light ocre in color. A lot of companies package an inferior product in colored capsules so that you can't see what you're swallowing. If you want to be sure you're getting what you pay for, stick with Twinlab Ultra CoQ10."
5,Canta Once Grandes Exitos de Juan Gabriel,"Originally released in 1987, this was the last Juan Gabriel album she did (until their reunion in 1997) before she started working with Marco Antonio Solís in 1988. Every song on the album is a cover of a song that JG previously recorded himself. Highlights include ""No Me Vuelvo a Enamorar"", ""El Farsante"", ""Con Todo y Mi Tristeza"", ""Inocente Pobre Amiga"", ""La Diferencia"" and the beautiful ""El Día Que Me Acaricies Lloraré.""01. No Me Vuelvo a Enamorar02. Yo Me Voy03. El Día Que Me Acaricies Lloraré04. El Farsante05. No Vale la Pena06. Con Todo y Mi Tristeza07. Todo08. Yo No Sé Que Me Pasó09. Caray10. Inocente Pobre Amiga11. La Diferencia"
2,Get this from your local library,"Don't waste your money. I agree with the other reviewer: this book started out promising, and just fell flat in the middle and end. I had to slog through it, wanting to justify my purchase. It seems to go on and on, and with so many characters, the story becomes far more convoluted that necessary. Editor, please!"
1,A time-waster,"My book club read this book and each one of us found it boring, confusing, and non-engaging. If you're the type who will plow through a book hoping it will improve, or that the ending will justify the entire read, you'll be sadly disappointed."
2,This book needed a good editor !,"This debut novel has a lot to recommend it, especially the characterization of its central character, Ann Whitehead, and the people she encounters while investigating the death of an unbalanced screenwriter-wannabe, but all the good stuff is lost in the too-busy plotting and redundant prose. Didn't anyone notice that Ann ""runs"" everywhere ? and that she continually asks herself a series of mental questions which seem intended to keep the plot twisting around itself. I think with judicious editing this could have been an outstanding debut, but as it is, its a bit of a mess."
3,Am I the only One Who Wanted a Better Ending?,"This book started out with lots of action and excellent character development of main charaters, Ann Whitehead and Doug Lockwood, however, it fell flat in the middle to end. I could not believe the ending and kept turning pages - albeit blank ones to see if some fool had torn out the ending. This author's first attempt is to be commended, but the ending is not even quite subtle, but blatantly disappointing."
1,Dont waste your Time or Money!!,"This is by far the worst tycoon game I have ever played! I love Tycoon games and have a huge variety. Some are better than others of course but this one was the worst I have ever seen. It is not even worth it to play it if it is free. It is very boring. I thought at first maybe I just didnt get this game, so I had other people play it and they all said it was the stupidist thing also. I thought it was so dumb that maybe I was just doing something wrong but guess not."
1,Unrealistic programming,"I have played many tycoon games and some are more difficult than others. However, TV Tycoon has absolutely no chance of winning. The setting is 1954, that is fine, except you begin with a Bank loan of 24,000,000 at an interest RATE of 20% per DAY (yes, that's correct)!!! In the beginning you can only make about 1-2 million a day which barely cover the 1 million dollar a day rental expense for the TV station.. by the time you are making any kind of income, the bank loan has compounded to over 60 million dollars, that would be 12 million a day interest, and at the end of 15 days you will owe over 1 billion dollars. NO way of winning this game! Not fun to always lose. Buy Zoo tycoon or Rollercoaster tycoon, or Resort tycoon, or Farm tycoon or SIM city instead. These games are winable."
1,The worse Tycoon game I have played,"I have played some wonderful Tycoon games including Pizza Tycoon and Ski Resort Tycoon. Rollercoaster Tycoon was even better than this one. I found it difficult to play and it had problems displaying the text. The concept was good, but it failed miserably. The graphics were terrible. Either this is very old or someone lost their touch. I was interested in Health and Fitness Tycoon, but it seems that the review for that is similar, and I can't find a demo, so I think it might be another dud. Don't want to waste my money again."
1,Miss Leading Web Site,"Web site miss leading not showing the base of the glass was hollow, and not solid. The glasses look very cheap and I would not use them."
4,"nifty CD, but....","Scholarship is suspect since cut for the 4th Century (and 8th, 9th, & 10th Centuries) has organ accompaniment, for instance. For that matter, since the bulk of it would ordinarily be classified as ""classical"" (I found it on the Rhino site and then come back here to buy it), please cross-reference it from ""popular"", Amazon. Bought it to hear the Oxyrhynchus Hymn Fragment for a report on Byzantine music, but I've been playing it over and over, thoroughly enjoying it."
3,Cool Novelty But Should Have Been Better,"This is a neat historic curiosity, but since they were willing to go beyond 20 tracks, why not include the oldest piece of music historians know of? And the excuse of using ""Louis Louis"" rather than the Beatles or Elvis or Frank Sinatra is weak (""most covered song"" - ha! - I suspect it has more to do with copyrights and royalties). Otherwise well chosen and intriguing - and all those chants are kinda relaxing."
3,Slow going,"I expected more footage on the birds themselves. I bought the DVD because I wanted to know about the behavior and biology of these birds. There was some information on that, but not as much as I would have liked to have had. It seemed to me that the scientists/researchers had more screen time than the birds. I wanted to see more birds and less reaction shots of scientists watching the birds. More birds and less scientists struggling through the forests.I've watched other PBS DVDs on birds and loved the Nature: Hummingbird dvd. It also included a little more footage than I wanted to see on bird banders. But on the whole, the documentary achieved a good balance between the scientist footage and bird footage. In Birds of Paradise, I felt like I learned more about the scientists researching the birds than I did the birds."
3,shows more people than birds,I wish it had more bird footage and less people footage.I have seen a very good video on cable but can not find it to buy
4,NATURE; BIRDS OF THE GODS,I ENJOYED THIS ON TV AND ENJOYED IT. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN MORE OF THE BIRDS BUT CONSIDERING HOW RARE IT IS TO JUST BE ABLE TO SEE THEM AT ALL IS AMAZING. MY WIFE IS A BIRD LOVER AND SO WE JUST HAD TO ADD THIS TO OUR COLLECTION.N. HAMMER
3,REGULAR FEW VIDEOS OF BIRDS.,"Very poor HD video and a few birds, I really do best videos here in Colombia and under budget.I think it is widely used low-quality digital zoom the image."
1,Most Aggravating,"I purchased this product for $17. from a catalog, it is the exact same exercise peddler and it was not worth any amount of money. Its parts are very loose your socks and pant legs will catch in the metal pins that hold the peddles on. I had to have someone stand on the end of it to steady while working it. The straps that go across the feet twist which makes the feet slip. I found this item to be very aggravating."
1,Cartoonish Art Work,"I agree - I was initially excited to find this deck, but didn't buy it because the artwork completely turned me off. Expecting beautifully spiritual depictions, I found childish buffoonish paintings. This concept has a great deal of potential, but the author and artist need to completely re-work how it's presented"
1,This could have been a much better product.,"I liked the Angel Oracle but the words ""ancient system"" to describe the Chakra Oracle are deceptive as hardly anything in the symbolism is true to the actual chakras as represented in Indian or Tibetan art forms. Had the symbols been true to classic forms this could have been a valuable addition to contemplatives meditative practices. The art work is childlike and inferior to the stated purpose of the product. Harish Johari's Chakras is a much better representation of the ancient system!"
4,Chakra Oracle,"A different look at the chakra system. I found it very interesting for meditation, and not buffoonish at all. Both sides of the cards are to be read to make your meditation complete. To each his own; I liked the set."
2,Misleading title,"I was also intrigued by the title when I found this book years ago. I was very disappointed when the author, after doing a pretty good job of exploring Zen, goes on to try and show how Christianity is somehow ""better"" than Zen Buddhism. I think he fails in the attempt and I don't believe it's necessary in the first place."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this cd for one song only ""God Give Me Strength"",although I do love the first track too.I knew this was a ""Used"" item,but it was not playable it skipped,and froze.The slip case was so smashed,and cracked (which could be replaced),but strangely was packaged in 2 layers of ""Bubble"" liners ??? Sadly, I had to send it back,and I can't justify paying a higher price for only one song."
3,Pretty good,"I purchased this CD because I liked a few of the songs and after listening to it, I like the songs I purchased it for and not really any of the others. Bottom line, if you like the songs, you won't be disappointed."
4,Good stuff!!,"Very interesting story. I enjoyed it, but I have to say that if any part or parts of the story had a basis in what might have actually happened, that would make it a FASCINATING read that I would not soon forget and certainly desire more of!!!!!!!! The fact that one of the characters has a similar background to the author's, causes me to suspect that this story does have its roots in fact but cant be presented in that way for reasons only known to the author.Is he framing true information within a false story because it's the only way acceptable to those who govern the truth?? I will continue to search for clues to confirm my theory of its fact based core.His second book is soon to be delivered and I'm very much looking forward to it."
2,1st one was better,"I commend the boys for designing a rather new style for N64, but it doesn't have near the detail or funniness that the first one has."
3,Not as good as it sounds........,"Well for one, if your looking for a You don't know Jack type game this really isnt it. For ONE no one reads the question off for you, so if you lazy like me your gonna have to read it your self. TWO If your playing by your self there is no way to have a computer compnent so lets say you end the game by your self with negative a million, your going to be praised by the game, and LAST if you get a question wrong there is no one to tell you the right answer and explain it to you so hense you learn nothing from this game."
3,Dumb fun for almost everyone...,"Unnecessary but entertaining exploitation of the ubiquitous South Park license, the game show format is good for an hour or two of mindless trivial pursuit. The mini-games are fun but generally ridiculous knock-offs of classic arcade games. If you're not a South Park fan, you probably aren't going to buy it anyway. [...]"
5,Chef's Love Shack Amazing,"This game is one of the funnest games I have ever played in my life! It's witty questions, insane mini-games and all other aspects of the game are just the right amount for my liking. I think this is a great product and South Park fan or not, N64's South Park: Chef's Love Shack is a sure gift for the holidays!"
1,Worst game ever,"This game really was one of the worst games I ever played. It is slow, and not fun. The trivia would be interesting if it didn't take so long. This game would be good if you could pick a small game to play and practice or have fun with it. Do not buy this game, if curious, rent it."
1,South Park: Chef's Luv Shack,This game was one of the worst games I have ever played on the N64. It has no value for a single player and the enjoyment only improves little for 4 players. Even South Park fans may feel disapointed as this game doesn't follow the show much as the questions are hard and unrelated.
2,"Sorry people, CLS is a FLOP!","Look, I am huge South Park fan, but I am sorry, Chef's Love Shack was the biggest disappointment ever. One of my friends had rented it and invited me over to play it, let me just say, it was sorry. The questions for one, were few and confusing. They never give you the right answear, and by the third time playing it, I was seeing questions repeated. The mini-games were wanna-be Mario Party games, and had absolutely no entertainment value. Out of all the games, I enjoyed one. The only reason this game deserves higher then one star is the characters themselves. Stan, Kyle, and the rest of the gang are still hilarious, which at least made the game somewhat funny. I might rent this game if I was having a party or something, but please, do not make the mistake of purchasing it without trying it first. I guarantee you will be dissapointed. Oh, and one more thing, that ""Wheel or Fortuity"" is annoying."
2,Major flaws hamper an otherwise enjoyable game,"Like all ""game show"" games, this one suffers from the same flaws: (1) it's too easy to lock out your opponents by ""buzzing in"" early, and (2) not nearly enough questions. After only 4 plays, we started getting questions repeated. The mini-games are OK, but if they wanted an excuse to use South Park mini-games, they should have come up with a Mario-Party style RPG/Board Game to work them in, not the game show format."
3,Diappointed,"I suppose this machine was quite as advertised, so I should not complain. Howeveer it does not open tab-type cans, such as Campbell's Soup, satisfactorily. My principle use for it would be on these cans, so I have returned it."
2,Knife sharpener is a joke,"My old can opener broke, so bought this to replace it. This is not the sturdiest machine out there, that's for sure. I have to hold the top of the can opener, or the weight of the can pulls it over. the lid magnet is very flimsy, and the knife sharpener is a real joke. I kept the old can opener for the knife sharpener."
3,Disappointed,"I was replacing an existing opener. Turns out this ""tall"" opener is not as tall as the one I am replacing."
1,NOT recommended - drops cans,"I purchased this because most reviews were positive, but I wish I'd paid attention to the negative ones. This product dropped almost every can, regardless of size. After less than 3 weeks, I am done with this and shopping for a new one."
4,It's a can opener!,"This product does exactly what it says it does! It opens cans without leaving a sharp edge. It is difficult to work with tall cans but otherwise, it is just as advertised! Easy to clean, easy to use. I don't like the amount of counter space it uses but it seems most can openers use this much space, alas."
3,A Fun Remake,"This remake of ""Libelled Lady"" is an almost verbatim copy of the original. Van Johnson plays the lead and is very good, but Esther Williams is miscast as the society snob. Lucille Ball shines as the showgirl used as a pawn by Keenan Wynn, her fiance. Lucille is vibrant, and extremely funny in this role. It foreshadows her ""I Love Lucy"" persona but she also shows how well she can act. Get this one for a light-hearted laugh."
5,Who cast the love spell?,"If one of the author's goals was to punch a hole in the western wall between fact and fiction, she did an amazing job. The genre speaks for itself and is the perfect teaching venue. While reading I asked myself a number of questions: Can a metaphor really be a metamorphous? Is the author Phyllis channeling the authored Phyllis? Can a book about the magic of love also be a magic book? If so, the book is as much a love spell cast on the reader as it is about the main character casting a love spell in order to find the true love of her life."
1,A Boring Diary,"I absolutely without a doubt loved Phyllis Currott's first book, Book of Shadows. When I found out that she had written another one, I couldn't wait to buy it, even though the reveiws I read hadn't been the greatest. Unfortunately, this book is nothing like her Book of Shadows. The Love Spell is a (boring) diary memoir of Phyllis trying to find ""true love."" Almost all of us have been though the up and downs of dating, etc. Reading about man problems, even with Wicca thoughout, it not any better. On top of that, every sentence that she writes, Phyllis has to make a comparison with her feelings, moods, etc. That makes for extremely tedious reading. I kept losing tract of where I was and where Phyllis thought she was. Was it real, or was it a daydream. Let go and let love."
4,You can learn from it...,"I think Phyllis Curott is a Witch that we all can learn alot from. You can learn more from her stories than most dictionary sized manuals on Wicca. So I definately recommend reading this book, especially before you do ANY love spell. Not because this is a cautionary tale that will convince you not to, but because it will lead you to do a richer fuller spell with a more aware and realistic attitude.I only gave it 4 stars though because as a novel it is slow and a tad on the tedious boring side. Especially compared with her first book Book of Shadows which I reread all the time just because the stories so good. Still I recommend this book as a great learning tool if not the most riveting read."
2,"uncommon hard-to-get, hard-to-want ingredients","I was looking for a fun little hors d'oeuvres ideas book for the common cook. This one uses strange ingredients, complex preparations, and quite frankly, very little imagination. The items in this book wouldn't be suitable for the crowd I hang out with. Even though the price tag is small I just can't see EVER using anything from it, so I am returning. Zoom in on that odd looking thing on the front cover - that tell's the story."
4,"if you love to entertain, this is the book for you","This book has all levels of appetizers so you can accommodate any party. Some are simple, some are complicated, but all are do-able and the ones I've tried are delicious! A great book!"
4,Great little appetizer book,"I do like this book. I have been in an ""Entertaining Mode"" lately so I got this book. It is divided into sections, and there is also menu recommendations. Like if you want to do a ""Asian"" themed menu, it will give you a list of recommended apps. From fried apps, soups, meatballs, and veggie bites, this book has a little bit of everything. Each recipe is pretty easy and can be doubled or tripled pretty easily as well."
4,Ras aint bad,"I bought this CD, because I wanted a christian CD, but didn't really know who was the best, so I picked one out of the blue, and for just pickin one, I'm pretty glad I got this one. Lil' Raskull's got skill, and I recommend it to someone who doesn't know too much about christian rap ... Best song's the last song ... Holy Hip Hop 4 Life!"
2,"SOn, Get me my shot gun its time for target practice","If your looking for the latest styles of rap, if your looking for something worth your money, if you are even looking for some decent / average rap then dont buy this cd. I only found one track that i like and that track wasnt worth the price of this cd. This CD Reminds me of OLd sckoo Rappin 4 tay. The bottom line is this: there are better christian rap music out there save your self your time and money and look somewhere eles. This Cd is a waste of spacetime for target practice"
2,Second Reading!,"Robert Payne's style is superb. He writes with an easy flow that brings history to life. It is the kind of writing that a reader does not want interrupted. At least that's what happened to me both times I read the book.As to Lenin, I wonder if he realized that in the end nothing would change. Institutions don't implode or explode permanently. They continue to live as seeds to re-emerge in more violent and destructive forms. After the end of the form of government he lived to create, who is he in history? Surely a revolutionary, but does he already belong to the dinosaurs?"
1,no nutrition info on website,I don't appreciate that there is absolutely NO nutritian information about this product on the Amazon website. Lots of flowery language but no facts.
3,What happened Stacys???,"Can't buy this anymore on Amazon, the prices in the stores are outrageous!!! Oh well, see ya Stacy's!!!! And the plain ones that Costco sells are as hard a dog biscuits!!! Stacy's tried to tell me that is the way Costco wants them. What a load of crap!!! They are just the rejects from Stacy's!!!!"
4,Even better than Stacy's Simply Naked,"They're great, with just about anything from white cheddar cheese & fruit, to dips, to hummus. The Simply Naked variety has always been a hit at parties - these are as good if not better, what more can I say?"
5,Perfect! George Lucas should have seen this first,"Galaxy Quest works on so many levels, it's a pity George Lucas didn't see it before he filmed Phantom Menace. No matter what you want, GQ delivers -- as a witty Star Trek spoof, as a sci-fi adventure, as a comedy, as summer escape, as an old fashioned salute to ordinary guys-turned-heroes.This movie draws on all the cliches, and yet manages to give you fresh, clean entertainment, hitting a rare sweet spot of warmth and intelligence. Sound familiar? It should: the original Star Wars had many of those same qualities, albeit on a grander scale. In its own unassuming way, Galaxy Quest (not Phantom Menace) is actually the true heir to the modern sci fi tradition.P.S.: yes, Tim Allen really can act."
4,It's a great movie.,"It isn't like hilarious funny, but it is pretty amusing.It's about a bunch of actors that do a space show whose broadcast is picked up in outer space. The aliens thought it was non-frictional and came to Tim Allen for help. He got the whole casting crew to help and they went into outer space. There's lots of neat things that happened. One of the funny things is that the space ship is modeled exactly after the one in the show. You'll know how that is funny when you watch the movie. That's all I saying. Watch it for yourself."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Hated it. Every minute of it. I've tried watching it three times because my older brother actually bought it, but I've fallen asleep every time. Rent Napoleon Dynamite if you actually want to laugh."
1,about as interesting as actually watching Star Trek,"I'm not sure who is supposed to like this film. If you don't like Star Trek you won't get half the ""puns"" and if you do like Star Trek you won't like having fun poked at you as a geeky Billy No-mates who dresses up as his favourite actor 20 years after the show ended.Try Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels if you want to see a genuinely funny comedy."
3,This movie is a fun ride,"I actually give this movie a 3.5. Galaxy Quest is about former actors who participate in a real life battle with alien foes. Ridiculous this concept may seem but it actually does well when it comes to entertaining you. The movie was funny, it had a well developed plot, the acting was good, and you feel for the characters as they tried to defeat the forces of evil. The main characters had depth to them and the characters depicting a show gave a nice twist to things. Kids will especially like this film as it is silly and has flashy special effects. But adults will find this movie unrealistic and that I think will turn them off from this movie a bit. (A boulder monster?) I think this movie defies every law of physics on the books. In conclusion I think a lot of people will enjoy this movie and I recommend it to kids and people who like to get lost in fantasies. Got any thing to say about what I said? E-mail me at: omicron_30@yahoo.com"
4,This is a good movie,I saw this movie a long time ago it is a comedy ill tell you that.It was a ok plot just it was overall plan funny thats all buy it or go see it!
3,Amusing and Enjoyable,"The has-been cast of a cult science fiction series much like Star Trek are mistaken for real space warriors by a group of aliens who need help fighting off an angry warlord and his troups. Never quite as funny or sharp as it could have been, and the good cast (especially Alan Rickman) isn't used to its full advantage, but it's amusing and enjoyable. Stars Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver."
5,"Fantastic, but a little bit gross","I really enjoyed this movie. It realistically parodies nearly every aspect of Star Trek without demeaning the series. The main problem is that at one point, an alien creature is teleported on to the ship inside-out and it explodes in a grusome display of gore. If it had to happen, they really didn't have to show it completely. Nevertheless, an extremely funny film."
3,"Cheesy, But Fun","It's nice to see a sci-fi movie that in many ways hearkens back to the old Flash Gordon flicks or B movies of the 50's that didn't have to rely on spectacular special effects to get the story across. Granted this movie is still slick effect wise, but the movie doesn't go overboard with ""in-your-face"" special effects. While the acting is a bit cornball, this is simply a fun movie."
2,Galaxy Quest,When i got this DVD in the mail the case was cracked. The sellers should have used better packing materials.
4,Excellent Parody,This well written spoof of Star Trek is chock full with well known actors. The ending is terrific too. A perfect addition to anyone's Blue Ray library.
3,THOUGHTFULLY CRAFTED SATIRE,"As much a send-up of fan-hood as sci-fi tv, this clever adventure has something to offer everyone. Star Trek fans will see the jokes coming minutes in advance...but that's why we're so cool. The alien race called Thermians present themselves as Pee-Wee's Playhouse rejects, as they grovel and beg for assistance in fending off a deadly enemy. Unaware the mercenaries they have drafted are actually typecast actors who now make a buck as celebrity Mall grand-openers, they take great pride in having secured what they believe are the bravest warriors in the galaxy. The amotivational ""rock monster"" is a highlight, and is strikingly reminscent of many Star Trek TOS episodes. Very easy to swallow; and Sigourney, as Gwen, as Madison, makes quite the ravishing blonde. Heart-warming finale leaves one wishing for a sequel."
4,So what are the cast of Star Trek doing these days?,"This is not exactly a spoof of Star Trek, more like a spoof of the actors who were in the original Star Trek. Tim Allen takes the lead as Commander Taggart, along with Alan Rickman and the sci-fi great her self Sigourney Weaver (who looks incredible as a Blond in a cat suite). This movie is very funny and really enjoyable. The cast really looked like they had a great time on set, and this is shown on screen. The movie kinda of goes the way you want it too, but keeps you guessing along the way. I can't wait to have this on DVD, it should be incredible."
4,"One of the best ""Fish-out-of-water"" movies!","Being a big fan of Star Trek, I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters. So of course I bought the DVD when it came out and was a little underwhelmed by the special features. Cut to years later with this Blu-ray edition of Galaxy Quest and I am much more satisfied. With interviews with cast a crew on their processes on making the film and the behind the scenes footage is an awesome addition. Plus, the movie itself looks awesome in HD!"
4,Excellent Star Trek Spoof,"Tim Allen mocking Captain Kirk, Sigourney Weaver repeating everything the ship's computer says, classic. Bored, bitter and alcoholic from touring the conventions, the washed up has beens are suddenly beamed onto a ship modeled on their TV series and expected to defeat a formidable foe. The problem is -- even though their hosts expect them to know how to do everything (after all, they did on the show) -- they initially can't even perform basic tasks. This is a silly movie, but if you liked Star Trek and can handle some silliness, this is among the best you can get."
4,FUN FUN FUN,"The inspired casting of this movie is what really makes it tick, and the idea of jaded television star has-beens being whisked off to an alien planet to save the world certainly unfolds with its share of lunacy and laughs. Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver are particularly funny, playing the entire fantasy straight. The special effects are top-notch, and the humor often delivers, but the movie is one star away from comic explosion, and it could have been. What with the intrinsically funny idea of Trekkie-type rabid fans and the faded glory of popular icons who merely acted their way to glory, is a premise ripe with wildly funny possiblities. This movie is breezy, has its charming moments, but, if made for example by the skewed comic genius of Christopher Guest, without quite as much PC/tender moments, might have been a comedy classic."
4,Excelent show,It's a fun concept and they really pull it off - great actors having fun is really fun to watch.
4,a star trek spoof,this movie is so funny. if you are or ever where a star trek fan and your looking for agreat laugh this is the movie to see. but even if your not a fan you would still get a good laugh.
4,"Silly, but O.K.","This movie was bought not expecting a great plot, I wasn't disappointed. Still liked it."
3,Nicely goofy,"A cute takeoff on the whole ""Star Trek"" fan phenomenon, ""Galaxy Quest"" is a movie I can genuinely describe as a hoot--not a roll-on-the-floor, laughing-till-you-cry movie, but one that elicits a good chuckle on a pretty frequent basis. Tim Allen's dead-on William Shatner imitation (""Never give up! Never surrender!""), Sigourney Weaver's surprisingly effective Wonderbra-sporting lieutenant, the always great Alan Rickman doing that patented exasperated eye roll as the Spock clone, and scene-stealer Tony Shalhoub (you might remember him as Antonio on ""Wings"") as the laid-back tech sergeant are all in fine form and obviously having fun. It's not ""American Beauty"" (or even a ""Star Trek"" movie that takes itself too seriously), but it is a fun movie to watch. Get out the popcorn and Haagen-Dazs and let the good times roll!"
5,First Rate / Witty / Funny / Great Entertainment,"Basically for almost everyone ( exception: small kids who might be frightened by some of the aliens ). A great flick and a nice surprise. I normally HATE Tim Allen movies but this is a true gem. Sigourney Weaver is great. Heck everyone is great especially Allan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub and the red shirt guy."
5,AWSOME.,"I usually don't care for Tim Allen, But he is great in this movie! As is Sigourney Weaver. Heck, The whole cast is great. I am a big STAR TREK fan. Now I can say I am a big Galaxy Quest fan also. I think people who don't like Star Trek will enjoy this movie. The special effects are great. I plan on buying the dvd as soon as it becomes available. My mother went to see it also, & she loved it too. She is 66. It is a movie that the entire family will enjoy. Except for very young children. They might be scared of some of the aliens in the film. Awsome movie."
5,Wonderfully funny,A movie well worth watching. Get it. Get it now. You'll enjoy this movie everytime you see it.
4,Galaxy Quest,The item was advertised to have some scratches on it but it's appearance was perfect and I enjoy each performance.
5,this makes me laugh,"This is such a great movie parody of the Star Trek phenom. From the way he sits in the capt chair to the dramatic poses, shirtless scenes and winning at the ned. The only negative...no next movie."
4,Hilarious,"It's a rock, it doesn't have any vulnerable spots! Great movie to pass a boring Saturday night. Love this movie."
5,Great movie for a great price,"Galaxy Quest is one of my favorite parody movies of all time! Each cast member does a phenomenal job, especially Tony Shalhoub. I didn't feel I needed blue-ray for this one, so for the price, how can you not add this DVD to your collection?"
4,"By Grabthar's Hammer, A Good Movie!","I first saw the film in the theater. Unfortunately, I missed the first 20 minutes of the movie, and came in just as Tim Allen's character first showed off the real ship to his co-stars. I finally saw the whole movie a year or two later on cable. Later a friend bought it for me on DVD.A movie worth watching."
4,Galaxy Quest.....treking.,"Borrowing many snipets from classic 60's+ sci-fi series and flicks Galaxy Quest is a comedy for all treky fans and alike. Starring Home Improvements Tim Allen as Commander Taggart, and Alien's Sigorney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco, as the actors who have been called apon by aliens to be saved by their heros (above mentioned) unaware of their heroic exploits are no more real than Weavers hair colour.If you're looking for a good laugh, this is where you look no further, its a fun movie. Picture and Audio quality on this DVD were equally enjoyable with both doing justice to the format. This DVD also contains a hidden feature worth looking out for, visit ... for the details."
5,Loved It.,This was just plain outright funny. Pokes fun at the Trekkies out there. Tim Allen is super as is Sigourny Weaver. Two thumbs up.
4,Great Star Trek Parody,"I'm more of a science fiction fan than a fan of comedy, but there is plenty to laugh at here if you're familiar with the original Star Trek series. Allen makes a great Kirk."
4,Good satire!,If you like Star Trek and think its a holy object then do not see this film. It is one of the best satires of the series that is just asking for it. Good Sat. Afetrnoon fun!
4,A Hilarious parody of Star Trek,"Star Trek is probably, in my opinion, the most overrated shows and movies I have ever seen. Which may be why I liked Galaxy Quest, because it pokes fun at the people who are obsessed with Star Trek and it's has been star's. Tim Allen plays the actor who played the ego-maniac captain, sound like a certain actor from Star Trek? Sigourney Weaver plays the beautiful blond who plays the tight-uniform wearing actress from Galaxy Quest. Which she only gets interviews about her cleavage and not her career. All the cast members are suddenly swept away to another world where they must do what they been acting like they were doing on TV years ago, in order to save these alien's world. The laughs are many and the fun is non-stop. A well done film. GRADE: A-"
5,Review by Primaat,"Greetings... I am Primaat... I am from... France... I found great earth humor in this series of still images placed on a very good tasting acetate media... Very clever these Tarans, to make a media that is both enter-taining and delicious, when consumed with fried chicken embryos, and the beverage made of hopps. Upon viewing, my cone realed in waves of...delight... Not since seeing Yaknoo the Humorous on the third planet of the Neepzor System ... (I mean ...Paris, in ..France) has my cone been so filled with mirth. I recommend this highly to earthlings and others wishing to be entertained and nourished at the same... time... Earthilings in space! hahahahaha In Summation, I, Primaat rate this both 5 stars plus for it's entertainment value, and the taste of it's acetate media."
2,"Limit one joke per movie, please...","So much money, so many stars, so much obvious makeup and predictable ""cgi"" effects, all to restate the ""Star Trek"" jokes that have been in the public domain for years. Pass this one by ""at warp speed""."
3,Not again...,"This movie could have been much better. I give the 3'rd star unwillingly;) It was dry, with worn-out humor using great actors which made it even worse! I waited the whole movie for a genuine laugh, and I really wanted to...really.It's worth a rent...but let's be real. The movie is not that funny."
2,Thermian Audio Track?!,"This is a pretty good movie, but what's the deal with the stupid Thermian Audio Track?! Yeah, that makes sense -- let's waste disc space with a moronic audio track only a few supergeeks will listen to for about 5 minutes before it even gets on THEIR supernerd nerves. We certainly wouldn't want to include a French or Portuguese language track. You know, a REAL language. That wouldn't make sense! Then we'd probably sells thousands of more blu-rays to people who don't understand English or the dubbed Spanish track or (wait for it... wait for it...!) THERMIAN!Stoopid."
1,BLAND AND UNINSPIRED!,Don't believe the hype! This film would barely cut it as a made-for-tv movie. The story is obvious and boring. The characters are unimaginative and dull. Tim Allen is a little too self-satisfied with his phoned-in performance. Making fun of Trekies is like shooting fish in a barrel.
1,Stink-o-rama!,"This movie stunk! I was soo hoping it would be good, but it wasn't. I'm sorry. I actually had to stop the madness and shut it off with about 30 minutes to go.The plot was decent, and I really thought with the good cast it would be hysterical, but it was not to be. I found I only mildly chuckled, and before I knew it, I was more than a hour into the movie.The guy from ""Just Shoot Me"" plays a really annoying alien that makes you grind your teeth.If you want laughs, I'd look elsewhere!"
5,A Great Family Movie,This is a movie for a family. I saw it in a movie theater first and laughed my head off. Then I saw it on a plane and laughed even more. This is a funny movie for the family. I would recomend it for the whole family but young children might not understand it. There are only a couple of innapropriate moments. Tthis is one of the only family movies that isn't stupid like Barney.
4,It's surprisingly funny!,"I'm not a great Star Trek fan. If, however, you've ever watched a Star Trek episodes or an Alien movie, Galaxie Quest will make you laugh. This movie takes a light-hearted approach to itself while maintaining the semblance of a plot. Watch this one with the family. It's good-hearted fun."
4,Galaxy Quest,"Mildy funny movie. Very funny in a couple places. Enrico Colantoni was a hoot, but I'd rent this before I bought it."
5,Galaxy Quest,This was a gift for a friend and he loves it. It arrived on time for his birthday and we are all quite satisfied. Thanks for the service.
5,A galaxy full of giggles.,"An old cult Sci-Fi show is off the air & is doing conventions. Suddenly, REAL ALIENS show up..thinking that the episodes were a documentary,they come asking for help to solve a situation regarding an evil alien. I can imagine the cast of Star Trek doing this for real too. The whole thing is totally funny."
3,Galaxy Quest - DTS,"Briefly, because the previous reviews cover it quite well, it's a good comedy. If you're looking for a good comedy to add to your collection, this would be it. It will span a number of years in your collection before someone asks....""Galaxy Quest...what's that?""All the characters come to life in Galaxy Quest in a genre that often leaves one thinking...that character isn't real. Everyone will have a favorite, but Guy's interaction with the regular crew of Galaxy Quest is worth the price of the DVD alone, not mentioning the performances turned in by the rest of the cast."
4,Good Laughs,"I was expecting this movie to be rather bad. Just when I was beginning to think renting this film was a horrible mistake, Tim Allen's character encounters real aliens. The real fun and real hilarity begin here. The jokes had my boyfriend and I giggling for days. The special affects are good and there's plenty of action.The only down side to this film are the appearances of the pig monster and the alien enemy. The pig monster looks exactly like what it is--a man in costume. The enemy looked like a variant of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In contrast, the baby aliens (obviously computer generated) were fabulous. Both their look and their movements were superb. Fortunately, the appearance of the pig monster is brief and it doesn't take much from the overall feel of the film. I was able to thoroughly enjoy the movie and would love to see it again. If you like comedies and you like Star Trek, you're sure to like this film."
4,Very enjoyable,"This was a very enjoyable ""poke"" at the whole Trekkie phenomenon. I wonder how William Shatner would handle himself if he were transported to another galaxy. Allen is surprisingly good. Weaver is not only beautiful but hilarious. The real show stealer, for me, was Alan Rickman. He is consistently one of the best actors working today. Enjoy this one. Try not to be overly critical of the thin spots, because the vehicle works quite well on the whole. I'm not sure if a sequel is warrented, but I guess they've earned the right to make one."
3,movie feedback,Watch this after watching Star Trek and you'll howl--at least my husband did! Till his side hurt!!!
4,Set Phasers to Fun,"This surprisingly fun spoof of the Star Trek culture was purely light entertainment. The star-studded, ironic (Tim Allen (voice of Buzz Lightyear) and Sigourney Weaver (from the ""Alien"" movies) lead the way) and burnt-out cast of the fictional sci-fi TV show ""Galaxy Quest"" find themselves on a real-life mission when aliens visit the earth. The hambone acting skills and vague familiarity with a spaceship set that work so well on TV help the crew save the . . . well I'll leave it to you to find out. But Star Trek fans won't be offended as there's hardly even a ""stun"" setting in ""Galaxy Quest's"" satirical ray gun. Even the seemingly over-obsessed Trekkie-types come off looking good by the end. Four stars as fun family entertainment. A star less if you're looking for anything even remotely deep--you'll be left still looking, but somehow charmed in any event."
4,Characters and References,"Unlike most parodies Galaxy Quest has storyline. Granted, the storyline is utterly outrageous but it is also utterly hilarious. It also has some strong characters, something which really drives a good story but the thing that sets Galaxy Quest apart from other parodies is that it isn't really a parody. Sure, it's main purpose is to poke fun at Star Trek and its fans but what stands out as you watch the film is that you don't have to know everything about Star Trek to enjoy it."
4,plucky comic relief,"A parody shouldn't be a good film in its own right, but this is. The DVD makes it even better, with a rich menu of extras, esp. supplemental documentaries and outtakes. We can argue about whether the outtakes belonged in the film -- though it helps to see what the director felt compelled to discard (though I think Dr. Lazarus' tour of his quarters was worth retaining). DVD sound and video quality superb.The actors' backgrounds show how remarkable this film is, in that several dramatic actors -- Sigorney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, Alan Rickman -- hand in hilarious out-of-type performances in Galaxy Quest.Very worth owning. Grabthar knows why, but it is."
5,celestially funny,"Hilarious send up of Star Trek and pop sci fi shows in general. Unforgettable characters and lines provide laughs but also insightful social commentary. Craftily directed ""show within a show."" Wonderful"
4,Movie is great on a number of levels...,"Not only does this film parody the Star Trek series and its spinoffs, the cast of the former must've been in the minds of the creators because it seems to tell that cast's stories. But generally I'd say, this film is about what makes people keep going throughout their jobs everyday, that there is hope, and even meaning in some of what we do, individually. Maybe we matter, maybe our beliefs matter. Many of us don't really like our jobs. Maybe we lose conviction. The movie approaches these ideas with a notion of hope. It is a comedy, and most people I know have a good time watching it and like it. I give it four stars out of five because it is a fun movie and takes itself and the comedy seriously. It has a good pace."
4,A good spoof of star trek,"This is a movie about a group of actors from a canceled SCFI TV show. These actors make the money by making appearances at the shows fan conventions. These actors are mistaken for the real thing by a group of aliens who are being slaughtered. They ask for their help. They have biult an actual ship based on the television transmissions of this show.This show is a great spoof of Star Trek and its fans who have a hard time grasping reality. The ending is fantastic when they have a shootout with the bad guys. The show is renewed as ""Galaxy Quest: The saga continues"". I guess they would have got into trouble if they called it ""Galaxy Quest: The Next Generation""."
4,Fun and funny,"I didn't really want to see this movie, but ended up going on New Year's Eve 1999 with my family. To my surprise, this is a very funny and sweet adventure. I highly recommend it!"
4,Trek Goof Film,"Sigurney(I can't spell her name) Weaver as Barbie.Tim Allen as Captain Kirk(Sorta)Alan Ricknam as a Spock/Tuvock/Data Fusion(Interesting!)Tony Shaloub as a spineless Scotty(Did a great Job)This is the Funniest film since Airplae in 1980. OK OK Since Star Trek The Motion Picture.SEE THIS ONE!By the way, ILM did the effects for the movie, NOT PARAMOUNT IN HOUSE DILDOS! State of the art Silicon Graphics machines REALLY HELP!"
2,Some humor,"This movie was a fair attempt to poke fun at Star Trek. It had some laughs, but mostly left me grasping for a reason to keep watching it. I realize this is a spoof but, there was an attempt at character development which left me almost wondering which character was which. I was just looking for humor and I guess I got a little."
5,Great quality for a great price.,Really wanted to find this movie and it wasn't in any stores that we went to. Was excited to find it at such an affordable price and the quality and processing time were excellent. The movie arrived fairly quickly and we watched it that day and the quality was perfect. It was great to get a reasonably priced DVD that was also in perfect condition.
5,"Great movie = great DVD, love the extras","While this is my first DVD, I have rented a few and this one is fun. Got it for my wife who loves Star Trek - we both like the movie a lot and got a kick out of it. There are extra scenes included and a cool interface. Glad I ordered it. Classic movie."
3,Mistake in DVD info,"Ignore the advertising which claims that the DTS version of the DVD has the Galaxy Quest television series ""Mockumentary"". It does not. Amazon has been informed of this, but has neglected to update the catalog.It was supposed to have been included on the DTS release; but apparently the studio has decided not to include it, and failed to update their release information to reflect the change.If you don't have DTS audio capability, buy the standard version, because they have the exact same features aside from the DTS audio."
3,Mind-boggling.,"I didn't really 'get' 'Galaxy Quest' because I've never seen 'Star Trek', and have no desire to (although my wife's a fan, and she didn't think this was very funny). I'm not too enamoured of the actors involved either, although Sam Rockwell is splendid as the Everyman guiding us through the tricky switches between 'fantasy' and 'reality'.But 'Quest' is available to more than just Trekkies or Tim Allen admirers. The (presumably) intentionally tacky set-designs yield some real flourishes (the berillium (sic?) island; the nightmarish climax). Best of all for those who felt cheated by the 'Borges' comparisons thrown at 'Being John Malkovich', is a truly vertiginous conflation of time, narrative and identity, so that by the end, yuo're about as close to the Garden of Forking Paths as you'll ever be in Hollywood."
3,Funny but not a classic,"This film is a funny film in it`s own right, but to a long term sci fi fan who has avoided the depths of nerdyness by keeping away from the treky conference circuit. this hits the target. If you speak Klingon this movie is very definitely for you. ( or maybe about you ? )The only thing wrong is that it isn`t a DVD you are going to watch over & over again, it hasn`t got much repeat appeal and the extra feature of a sound track in Thermian, sounds an amusing idea , but in truth is excruciatingly irritating."
2,Alot of running around that didn't make sense,"I was disappointed in this film because I have been a fan of Star Trek for many years. There were a few moments that were humorous, but I kept waiting for the film to go somewhere. Maybe my sense of humor is delegated to films such as ""Hot Shots"", ""Naked Gun"", ""Airplane"", etc. If it relied more on Star Trek where you could identify the characters or situations, it might have been funnier. It just seemed that there were alot of scenes where the actors were running around with nowhere to go."
2,Why did I like this movie in the theater?,"I saw this movie in the theater and loved it, but when I rented the DVD to show my uninterested family I found it uninteresting myself. I wonder what happened. One time I see it, I love it, the second time I'm board and want to go play video games. Odd, must be a one timer."
4,A Keeper,This is one of those movies where you can watch over and over again. It's funny and tries not to take itself too seriously. The casting is perfect. The best part is watching the characters' attitudes change during the film. Definitely one to buy.
4,Much better than I expected,"I have to say, I originally watched this film to see Ms. Weaver play a regular, pretty girl...something she doesn't often do....she was very sexy, no offense, and has the brains to play a pretty blond VERY well. (Too often in today's society we forget that it takes a very talented actress to PLAY this type of blond. And she looks great in the longer wig...)I was very pleased to find that this was an all around pleasing film...watchable over and over again. I'm not a Tim Allen fan, but all the actors were good in their respective roles. I would recommend this flim to any one, any date, and any family...."
4,Lots of fun,"I went into this movie unwillingly, determined not to enjoy it. Within the first twenty minutes I was laughing out loud. This movie doesn't take a low IQ to enjoy as was stated in the other reviews. (Besides the fact that anyone judging other peoples' IQs had better learn how to spell the word ridiculous correctly.) On the contrary, it takes a desire to have a good time and enjoy yourself. I found Galaxy Quest to be a highly entertaining movie."
4,Grows on you........,"When I saw Galaxy Quest I was disappointed. Totally. But I hear everyone talking about it and how funny it is and then I start to like it each minute I think about the movie. It really is pretty cool.A bunch of aliens come to America to collect three actors from a sci-fi adventure TV program to help them fight this plant-lookalike guy called Cirius. They accept, but they don't know what the future is going to be like.At the end of this movie I couldn't stop laughing and I was still laughing on my way home! I was laughing so much my sides hurt! See it!"
4,Worth of a good laught,"The movie worths for the comic scenes, Sigourney Weaver's blond hair, the great special effects and the sound quality. Packed full of extras and a special audio track, in Thermian language (which is always good to show to your friends), gives the final touch for this DVD, that should be part of your home collection."
5,Galaxy Quest- A Great Movie,"Galaxy Quest is a great movie it is funny, interasting, and funny. And it is not anything like Star Trak.It is about a group of Actors who act in a tv show called Galaxy Quest and they are having a reunion thing years later. Then a group of aliens come and ask for their help and they help. They have problems fighting off this Suris(that's not how you spell it). Will they deffet him?What will happen? Rent or Buy the Movie. Have fun watching.Anna Jane Miller"
4,Great Saturday Night Movie!,"Invite your friends (with or without kids), pop some corn, turn on the bigscreen and pop this into the DVD and at the end, everyone will be chuckling gleefully. I know this sounds like a publicist's blurb, but trust me, this one delivers. And it's good enough for re-watching.Ingenious premise, great cast, comedy, pathos, fine F/X, happy endng, no profanity (despite some intense dialogue, none needed) and the delicious Alan Rickman. Is he playing against type? It's hard to say, except that he's perfect as a sort of Shakespearian Mr. Spock manqué. In fact, it's fun to see the Star Trek crew - both generations - skewered by proxy here.Most everything is right with this movie, though I do have a couple of quibbles about plausability with couple of scenes (Yes, with a premise this implausable, I quibble about plausability.) but Galaxy Quest is such an enjoyable that I rate it a solid 4 stars."
4,Actually a pretty good lesson,"I have also watched this fun movie several times (all without my sweetheart who hates the idea of sci-fi) and I liked it because it teaches one of my favorite theories. It is impossible to pretend to be something for very long without in some way becoming that thing. The key is what do you pretend to be? Hopefully it is something more noble than what you may have been. I don't mean that it is good to be hypocritical, just that by stiving to be the man you would like to be is better than settling for the man you are. Maybe that is way too deep for this fun spoof of the Star Trecified shows.So here's the deal, this is a funny if a bit silly spoof that just might give you something to think about if you are in the mood."
5,Surprisingly great movie,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. It is definitely the best comedy I have seen. The concept of having has-been actors mistaken for real space adventurers is pure genius. I initially thought it was going to be corny, but I quickly found that the scenes had a good balance between humor and serious drama. And the transition between the two worked great. Not only did the movie successfully show us how ridiculous situations can get, but it showed us the consequences of bad decisions when we get into those situations. The convention scenes suffiently looked like ""DragonCon"" to have me laughing. And the special effects were surprisingly good. I ended up watching this movie a couple of times when I first bought it on DVD. I give this movie my highest recommendation."
4,Galaxy Quest,Very easy and fun movie to watch and the pairing of Tim Allen and Signory Weaver is perfect and the movie is a good Comedy for all ages
5,Great for Family Collection,"Great family film, funny, original, adveturous, hard to find on dvd, even harder to find on Blu-Ray. It's not epic but it's fun and well worth it. We only buy the movies we ""really"" like on Blu-Ray and this one makes the list. Gets better everytime we see it."
5,Review of movie --Galaxy Quest,"Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver in one the funniest films I've seen in years!At first it seemed to be just another parody of Science fiction films, but thensuddenly the whole movie becomes well I've given it a five star rating already."
3,Tiny Diny!,"It's my own fault for not reading the sizes, but this is one tiny dinosaur! But he is cute. Would maybe stay together for display but not for play."
3,less than expected,"this album is inconsistent in the 'classic' sense of wedding songs. Some very corny songs, but some people might like this..."
1,wedding music,"I bought this for my 30 yr. old daughter to help her select music for her wedding. She thought it was pretty ""cheesy"" and not helpful."
3,A Helpful CD,"This CD is OK and I did like the fact that""At Last"" by Etta James is on itI also was glad to finally find on amazon""A Song For My Son"" for the mother groom dance and""A Song For My Daughter"" for our father bride dance.I heard samples of these songs at [....]Thanks amazon.com"
3,OK love song CD,Bought this CD for ideas for songs in my wedding. I was a little disapointed that it didn't give me good ideas for my wedding. It had better songs on it just for classic love songs.
5,"Great, great, great","For anyone wanting a history of New York City, for whatever reason, this companion book to the DVD series is superior. There is very little left out, yet it is succinct and readable. Highly recommended."
4,What's missing,"There are no pictures and captions of the universities and colleges (especially the unique City College), of the major museums(inside and outsides), major sports facilities and Research Hospitals. And it stops too soon - unless there will be another volume. A book with pictures and captions only could be a big seller!"
4,A Great Read,"Growing up in the NY area,there was a lot I thought I knew about the city..that is until I read this book.very informative,the writing style is easy to follow and the section on the World Trade Center rise and fall pulls at the heart strings."
1,Not what you would think it is,this is not a video of the pretender tv series it is some christian conversion video but not at all what I was looking for WATCH OUT CUZ THIS ISN'T WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE I'D HATE FOR YOU TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
5,great movie.,"All of the Christano's brothers films are worth getting.This is about a guy who pretends to be a christian to get a christian girl to go out with him. Very entertaining and great message, forget the stupid tv show, this one can save your soul and lead you to the Saviour!Thanks for reading."
1,"Wrong, Wrong, WRONG!","Pretending is lying. Lying is a sin - not to mention one of the top ten - and just to ""get"" a girl?!?! When are people going to realize that the end does not justify the means and all is not well that ends well.Wrong behavior, wrong message, wrong to watch this movie."
1,should have told me it wasnt a dvd concert,If you just like cds its for you but if you like concerts dont buy it sure it got here fast but i need to see the band play
3,"Looks nice, fits awkwardly","I was impressed with how quickly this shipped and at the overall quality of the costume when I unpacked it, but things started to go downhill when I tried it on. My measurements are almost exactly what's indicated in the ""fits up to"" columns for a small on the Sizing Chart, so I thought it would fit snugly if anything--but this thing is gaping around the waist and chest, even when I have the ribbons done up as tightly as possible. I'm not sure what size the model is wearing because I'm not even as skinny as that. At the same time, the skirt looks great from the front but barely covers my butt at the back because it's all weirdly bunched up. It will be a great costume after some adjustments, but I'm a little disappointed that the size chart seems to be misleading."
2,"Rent, don't buy.","I am a big SP fan, but I can't recommend buying the game like I did. Yes, the voice-clips are funny and some of the zany action is fun (even if you know you're going to loose there is some fun in tormenting the other charaters with the games' weapons, etc), BUT YES, the novelty does wear off, and I was very frustrated to find you can't save and keep advancing from the saved point but have to start ALL OVER...that's just ridiculous, in any game--why the heck does anyone SAVE a game in the first place?? Ultimately, I sold my copy for store credit and bought Medal of Honor instead...much much more fun...if I want South Park I'll just watch the show/movie(s)."
3,"You know, I know its PS1 but somehow I still expected a little more...","What can really be said besides the fact that its South Park, its racing, and its crazy. The controls aren't the best or most responsive in this game. And it's more than a little annoying that you can't just choose any map when playing multiplayer and playing a map in multiplayer does not unlock any further maps. My guess is you have to unlock them in the single player campaign. More than anything else its clearly a game that someone didn't lose any sleep over (even while working to make it) and was put out there to cash in on the South Park franchise. But if you're a die-hard video game person and you have a jones for the South Park gang to somehow be involved then this game is worth the handful of dollar bills."
1,how bad could this game be,"the only reason that i can think of any one rateing this game as good is they like the t.v. show. and they like it so much they are blinded by how bad this game is. the game play is bad and you dont know were your supposed to go, and for a racing game, its just not fun they put this game out just to take advantage of the diehard fans of the show."
5,Tons of fun!!,"This has to be one of the most fun PS games ever. No brain power needed, just a great zone-out and relax game."
4,2 hours of beautiful music,ABBA and the BEATLES has some of the most beautiful music going. It was a joy to listen to it and a long drive.
4,Not as good as the original,"I already had the ""Elements of Life"" and waited with anticipation for this remix album. What made the first album so amazing was the teaming up of accomplished musicians and artist with MAW to create that natural sound and feel. A natural vibe comes across in the first album that seems to be missing on ""Extensions"". This album sounds almost like something that was created just because the record comapny wanted some remixes. Certainly not as good as the original but gives an interesting twist to the originals. After hearing the ""Extensions"", given the choice I would stick with the original."
2,Q would NOT be amused . . .,". . . Nor was I. To be fair there were some funny parts to this book, there just weren't nearly enough for me to recommend it. I found most of the book rather boring."
2,"Not the best, yet still interesting","This book does not talk about Q, the Q Continuum, etc. Rather, it has quick little nuggets of Star Trek info, like the ""Least Likable Humanoid"" and the ""Most Annoying Alternate Reality"". Also, the price is a bit steep for its content."
3,"Fun, but not worth the money","The book is good, light and funny, but US$16.00 is very steep. I read the entire book at the bookshop and did not pay a cent."
4,wonderful product,"i love it. after searching for so long for bible on c.d, i decided on this one and i dont regret it. its very good. i could f fwd or go back to any book i want including the chapter on my MP3. i love the way it's being read too. give it a try, you might just fall in love with it."
4,You should order this NIV Audio Bible.,"I enjoy Mr. McLean's reading of the NIV version very much. His theatrical style keeps you engaged in the stories, and occasionally offers fresh perspectives. His presentation of Acts 2:38 suggests to me that he hasn't personally experienced the ""Baptism of the Holy Ghost"" which Peter is describing there. However, I can't think of any doctrines which would suggest that only a Spirit (Holy Spirit) filled believer can read the scriptures in a public setting."
5,Great listening Bible,"Max McLean's voice is very soothing to listen to and he really brings the Bible to life. I hear things he reads that I never picked up with reading. I hightly recommned this recording for a ""book/Bible on tape"". (MP3)"
1,Dracula Reads The Bible For You...,That is exactly how this sounds... it sounds like an actor doing a fairly poor Dracula impression is reading the Bible to you... I'm going to try the Dick Hill version now...
4,Good bang for your buck,"I teach sunday school and have been looking for an affordable audio version of the bible. This is good bang for your buck. I was hoping to learn how to pronounce certain words/names, but he reads the bible in a non american accent.It slightly defeated my purpose, but i'm grateful to have this recording either way.This is not a dramatic reading, in my opinion.Erwin"
3,an old translation revisited,"Just some background: This translation was first published in 1963. No doubt it has been re-issued to cash in on the fad for anything relating to geisha. A better (but partial) translation, along with a biography of the author and other translations of his works, appears in Edward Seidensticker's ""Kafu the Scribbler"" (pub. 1965 and still available), and was reprinted in 1971 in ""A Strange Tale from East of the River, and Other Stories"" (out of print)."
1,Ours was a dud.,Conair CS18JCS Ceramic-Coated 2 Double Ionic StraightenerThis Conair hair straightener stopped working in less than 30 days. Very unimpressed.
5,It gives me chills on my neck and butterflies in my stomach.,"This song gives my the feelings I have when I think of the only guy I've ever loved ,I wish it would have came out sooner then I wouln't have had a problem with exspressing my feelings. Brandy is my idol and her music says everything I feel. Anything Brandy sings I love no matter what."
5,IT SHOULD RECEIVE 11 AWARDS.,IT SHOULD RECEIVE 11 AWARDS BECAUSE IT TELLS MY STORY AND MANY WHO REALLY WANT SAMEBODY BUT THAT SOMEBODY DOESNT CARE ABOUT THEM. SHE IS REALLY A COOL MUSICIAN. I LIKE HER.
5,THIS IS AN AWESOME SONG. IT DESCIBES MY LIFE PERFECTLY.,"THIS SONG IS JUST PERFECT TO DESCIBE MY LIFE. NEVER HAVE I SEEN A SONG THAT EXPRESSED SUCH NORMAL EMOTIONS. IT IS GREAT. I HAVE LOVED IT FROM THE MOMENT THAT I HEARD IT. EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T BOUGHT THE CD OF IT YET I PLAN TO DO SO VERY SOON AND WHEN I DO I PLAN TO LISTEN TO IT 24/7. I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE THAT HAS FELT LOVE, HURT, DESIRE, BREAK-UP OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT A NORMAL PERSON WOULD FEEL OUT OF A NORMAL RELATIONSHIP."
2,Usual romance,"It may be unfair to give this book only 2 stars because I think I grew out of this genre about 40 years ago. It was the typical love story with all the misunderstanding between the two lovers. I still do like a good romance book, but not this type."
2,"Inexpensive, but hardly any tone","Ordered these only because I needed ~$3.15 in cart filler to get free shipping and figured my back-up acoustic could use a new set of strings since the verrrrry old Elixirs on it were rusted out to all hell.Just finished putting them on, pulling and tightening and tuning, pulling and tightening and tuning, pulling and tightening and tuning....... still, pulling and tightening and tuning, pulling and tightening and tuning. You get the idea. I've been an Elixir fan for years and have put on many new sets of those (among others). Never before have I had to tighten each string this many times for it to hold its pitch -- I'm talking over a dozen rounds each! Not a good sign...Played five or six songs of different sounds after and found the tone of these guys to be pretty dismal. Very dull, no brightness to them at all. Would not buy again, even for $3.15, nor to even use as single break back-ups. Two stars because they are guitar strings and do, after all, ""work""."
3,good choice!,"i liked it, but now, this price is higher than i expected.get this 4.99 at local store!or buy better strings."
3,"Mostly good info, but a number of conflicts to PMBOK","The book attempts to follow the sequence of the PMBOK but in assuring what I am assuming is a required limit on quoting the book loses key points and objectives. There appeared to be a number of direct conflicts to the PMBOK and some cases of just bad info (3 point estimate P+O+M/4 ????).Study questions appear very straight forward compared to the actual test questions or other study books. I would suggest seeking out other study questions if this is the book you are preping for the exam with.In general was good information to read, but did leave a concern over what might be the the authors world and what migt be PMBOK world, and potentially leave one high and dry on the exam."
4,PMP Review,I have found this book and CD to be helpful in studying for the PMP exam as well as information about Project Management from a practical perspective. It is easy to read and well thought out.It is well worth the money.
3,Much Better than Anime,"I assumed this was going to be anime, so I avoided it like the plague. (I've never seen an anime flick that I didn't think was extremely lame.) But this film is actually a home-grown American-style cartoon, and a fairly good one at that. Don't expect to be blown away or anything, but you can certainly look forward to being entertained for ninety minutes or so."
2,My product is broken,"Good afternoon,In October 2008 I bought an atomic clock (La Crosse Technology WS-8117U-IT-OAK Atomic Wall Clock with Outdoor Temperature) that I installed in February 2009. This product worked perfectly up to this week, when it run out of batteries and the clock stopped working. I replaced the batteries in the clock as well as in the external temperature unit but it never start working again.I feel sorry because I was really happy with your product and I was wondering if there's any way I could get my clock repaired. I should add that I currently live in Bogota, Colombia, South America, and I had it shipped from the States.Sincerely yours,Guillermo Aparicio"
4,There is no seconds display!,It's a shame to sell a clock that's accurate to less than a millisecond but only displays the time to the nearest minute. It's like having a Ferrari that will do 180 mph but can't be driven over 35.
1,La Crosse Technology Atomic Wall clock w/Outdoor temp,The La Crosse Technology WS-8117U-IT-Oak Wall clock with outdoor Temperature doesn't work well at all. It never has the correct outdoor temperature and the indoor temperature is rarely correct. It turns out that it was a waste of money.We will never order another.
1,Worst clock ever,"Just received this clock, it will make a great doorstop! Don't waste your time with this one move on!"
1,Don't waste your money,Clock worked only for about a year. When we replace batteries outside temp. disappear. Still doesn't work. Contacted manufacturer multiple time on multiple occasions. Still no result. Disappointed
4,LaCrosse timekeeper,"While this is the 2nd LaCrosse Atomic Wall clock w/outdoor temperature that I've purchased, it's just a little different. This one registers the time, moon phase, and indoor temperature just fine. The outdoor temperature is about 10 degrees off. Since this clock is in my closet, I intended to use it to help figure out what to wear for the day. Looking out the window tells me whether it is raining or sunny but doesn't give a good temperature reading. Still like the clock for all the other features."
3,"Once again, the outside sensor has died","I am throughly frustrated with these outdoor sensors from La Crosse.Once again, the outside sensor has died.It has been sitting on a window sill, under a covered porch.No direct weather usually and no moving around. No abuse.It still died in less than a year.And when it dies, it is really dead.As other people have noted, the inside unit is fine.The clock and internal temperature sensor work great.I have purchased several of these over the years, a couple for myself and some as gifts.In EVERY case, the outside sensor has died, sometimes within months, sometimes as long as a year.I keep thinking that the 'newest version' will have the kinks worked out in the outside sensor.I continue to be mistaken.The outside sensor is a piece of junk.If they were $5 each, I'd just buy 3-4 outside sensors and live with it.But they are $10-12 each, plus shipping!Really?That works out to almost the same price as a totally new unit.VERY disappointed in this product."
3,Hard to read,"I love atomic clocks, been using them for many years. Have no problem getting the signal in central Florida, even though that's pretty far away from WWVB. This clock works fine for me, but it's hard to read the display at an angle. The clear plastic cover over the display also reflect other lights in the room making the time/temp hard to read. So the utility of the clock is very location dependent. In the right location (few reflections, viewed straight on) it's a good clock, otherwise an analog display atomic clock is probably a better choice."
5,Atomic Wall Clock,I have given several of these clocks as gifts. I have never experienced a problem with any of them. Nice
5,Second of Two and Both are GREAT,"This is the second of this exact model that I have purchased in the last few months. Keeps absolutely perfect time, no special orientation is required, such as 'facing' Colorado - works in any direction. The remote is accurate (I keep it in the garage to measure the temperature when an air conditoner is on and off) and each of the two clocks' time and temperature matches exactly. The oak looks beautiful with my oak furniture. No cons on this one - easy to read as long as there is some light in the room."
1,Outdoor Temp did not work,"The outdorr temperature gauge did not work. However, I did get a full refund quickly."
3,Good for RV,1: You cannot plug this clock into an electric outlet. It only runs on batteries2: Easily mounts in an RV with some Velcro strips3: The battery life is only 3-6 months
1,Outdoor Temp Sensor does not work,"Update Oct 2012The new unit I got worked somewhat OK, the outdoor temperature synched and work well in summer but did not work in the winters at all when I really needed to know the outside temperature.Now in Oct 2012 the unit display faded off and the unit is officially dead. So this thing costed me ~$15/year for time/temperature, other clocks in my home are at least 7-10years old and they still work - my 1 star review stands!Feb 2010I got this clock for the outdoor temp. feature and it simply does not work. Followed the procedure as is, mutiple number of times, in fact took the clock across town (in Cleveland, OH where I live) and tried resetting in a parking lot away from all buildings etc.-the outdoor temperature refuses to work- it shows very close to indoor temperature (65C instead of 25F). Gave it a one star because the time/date synch. is perfect.Planning to return this unit, not sure if I want to ask for a replacement."
4,Easy to read.,"With the simulated wood trim this clock is a nice touch to most décor. The large numbers are easy to read from across the room. There are a couple of recommendations though. First, when you place the outside sensor do not put it next to the building because it will read warmer in the winter because of the heat coming from the building. Try to place the sensor in the shade and away from concrete because that material radiates heat also. The other suggestion is if you mount the clock on the wall up high, then tilt it downward so that the numbers are easier to read."
4,La Crosse wall clock with outdoor sensor,"I'm really glad I got this clock. I've had it for about 2.5 years, and can't believe I never had one before. I stuck the outdoor sensor out of the way on my patio, and now I can see indoor and outdoor temps side by side at will. The batteries last a good long time (I think I've changed them twice), and, despite getting it for the temperature, I also like having the big, visible clock. My only minor diappointment is that I was never able to get the clock to synch to the atomic clock. I live right on the coast, and I guess any nearby tranmission tower must be behind me with no line of sight to the clock. However, setting the clock was not a problem so all is good."
4,Neat clock with extras,"We can tell the temperature instead of having to go outside and check how cold it is, or have to look online or watch the news and see what it is out there at the present time. The temperature sensor goes outside. It tells the temperature inside and out, the time, what moon cycle it is, the day, and date.Sometimes it has a problem updating with satellites to update the time, like when we switched to Daylight Savings time, it took several days"
4,Works OK,"Clock works OK except it does not pick up the time signal very often. Could be because I am in FL about as far away from Ft. Collins, CO as you can get."
5,Easy to set up trouble free,A sweet clock easy to set up trouble free records the phases of the moon and also has a sensor for outdoor temperature
3,Atomic clock with outdoor temperature,"I bought two of these wall clocks. One is working fine, showing both the inside temperature and the outside temperature. The other one is only showing the inside temperature. If it weren't for that, I would have given it a higher rating."
4,remote and clock are not in sync,"As I mentioned in the title remote and clock are not in sync. I left both, the clock and the remote side by side for several hours. The remote is showing 2 degrees higher. I know the clock temperature is correct, because it agrees with other thermometers that I have. Now each time I check the outdoor temperature I must subtract 2 degrees.Also full moon should show white, not black."
1,I hate these people,I got WS-8117U-IT and like an idiot assumed it would perform as advertised and separated the packing material from the product and tossed said material.Long story short I have tried repeatedly to get the stupid thing to set itself using brand new batteries and following the directions diligently only to have it refuse to do as it said it would do. I have no recourse since I tossed the original packing so I'm out my money.I'm going to try calling them tomorrow but my hopes aren't very high
2,disappointed,"This unit worked for a while, but a little over than a year after I purchased it the outdoor thermometer stopped functioning. I kept it outside but under cover so it was never exposed to the elements. Naturally I tried replacing the batteries, but to no avail. I have had to replace the batteries in the main unit three times in two years...didn't expect that. Each time I replaced the batteries, it took forever for the clock to reset itself so I ended up doing it manually. Overall I say this was a disappointing purchase."
4,"I love, love, love this gadget","I've had this device for about 2 weeks, and I love it. Very nicely put together - I love having the reliable automatic clock, the indoor outdoor temp, and it's very big and easy to ready. A techno klutz, I had no difficulty setting it up."
2,Not very good product.,It consumes too much battery power. Can't be viewed in the dark.And it can't be seen from far. The picture is sort of misleading.
1,Died in 32 days.,"I've had only one other La Crosse atomic clock with outdoor thermometer and the outside temp sensor died within about a year. Thought it might be the luck of the draw but after having this model for about a month, the display on the main clock kept going out. Then the inside temp stopped displaying. Finally it died a peacful death. I won't be buying any more La Crosse's."
2,Does not sync time,"Great concept. Except this thing does not sync time when it's in my office. If I take it outside, it will sync time properly."
4,"Great Clock, but be careful what batteries you use if...","This is a great clock. We have owned one for over nine months and rely on it for time and temperature every day. While the phase of the moon is not very important to us, the outdoor temperature, calendar, and atomic-accurate time is great. If you live in a cold weather climate, you will probably need to buy lithium AA batteries for the outside sensor. Our sensor kept failing initially, and like other reviews, we thought maybe we would have to replace the sensor. It was actually the batteries that were failing. Alkaline AA batteries could not handle the extreme Iowa cold. We installed two lithium AA batteries (about $3 each), and the clock (and sensor) have worked like a charm since."
2,Poor Display; Hard to Set Up; No Customer Service,"I regret buying this clock because it is just unreadable, unless you are standing very close to it, and in bright light. Forget about reading it in medium to low light or in the dark -- the black letters disappear into the medium gray background. I posted a picture on this site to show you how the clock looks midday, next to my bay window with lots of light shining on it -- see how hard it is to read?It was also hard to set up because the instructions were inadequate. I called La Crosse customer service for help, but only got a voice mailbox to leave a message on, and no one called me back."
2,TEMP AND TIME,THE CLOCK AND TEMP INSIDE WORKS GOOD BUT THE OUTSIDE SENSOR FOR THE TEMP DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE PURCHASE WAS THE FACT OF READING OUTSIDE TEMP WITHOUT MY FOLKS FROM HAVING TO GO TO ANOTHER SORCE FOR THAT VERY INFOMATION. DISAPPOINTING WHEN GIFTS DO NOT WORK. GRRR!
5,Always On Time,"This clock was purchased as a gift. It is the third La Crosse Clock I have purchased through Amazon. These clocks are very easy to use, perform as advertised, and are very reasonably priced. The people that receive them as gifts love having an absolutely accurate time piece in their homes!"
3,"Nice, but could be brighter",This is an attractive clock with convenient features. It works well. My only complaint is that the display could be brighter and have more contrast so it could be seen from a greater distance and more oblique angle.
4,awsome clock,I love my atomic clock due to the outdoor temp.Ilive in an area that freezes in the winter so it nice top know how cold it is outside without going outside
4,good value and reliable,"Okay so we moved to Maine and to a place where the weather changes frequently. I was looking for a limited function weather station , that had out side remote sensor so I could tell the temp without going out side. Not only did I want to know the outside and inside temperature, but because we live on the ocean and nothing effects that quite like the full moon, this wall clock had all the functions I needed. It is now 3 years old and running strong. It does seem to go through batteries more frequently that I would have expected but that is a small price to pay for all the information it provides. I have also checked the temperature against NOAA for my zip code and it is never more than a 2 degree variance. Not bad for the price in my mind.I would recommend this wall clock and would buy one again if this fell off the wall!"
3,Set up today; 'okay' so far,"Just purchased and set up today. Did not set itself; had to set manually. Will see later if it picks up signal so can keep itself set correctly (DST). What they don't tell you on the box is NOT to use rechargeable batteries, so we'll see how long regular ones last. Also, was going to put it in bedroom and use the alarm, but it is not lit so you can not use it to tell the time at night, so will continue using my old alarm clock which is lit."
2,It just doesn't work (have had 3 of them),"I really wanted to like this piece. It looks great, fits nicely in the small area we have above our doors for a clock and tells the temp which is the very first thing I want as soon as I know the time. The first one I bought worked great for over a year until the transponder got lost in a storm. The second one never worked at all. I give LaCrosse credit -- they replaced it immediately. But that third didn't work either. Spent lots of time with Tech Support -- who were very helpful and responsible but couldn't get it to work. Then, I matched the transponder from the second with the third clock and it worked! For about 3 days. Then it wouldn't work either. No combination, no matter how many times I reset and no matter how close I put the clock and the transponder would work. Finally just gave up on it. I have no idea why its so tough to get a good signal to travel only a couple feet (it was that close)."
4,Looks good,This clock looks nice enough for most any but the most formal setting. My only criticism is that the display could show in a higher contrast and have larger numerals.
1,Don't bother with this waste of a product,"Money aside, this product was very dissapointing, especially to a 7 year old little girl who was so excited to have a glittering butterfly tatoo on her hand. The tatoos are poorly created, as once you peel off and apply the glitter to one side, the ""other"" side, which is supposed to be sticky as well, is not. We tried 6 or 7 different tatoos, and all were the same. Again, this product is ""poo-poo"" according to my 7 year niece. Personally, I'll stay away from any product produced by Creativity for Kids."
3,A new definition to the word boring,"The book gives new definition to the word boring. Anybody with sleeping problems will sleep within fifteen minutes. It get three stars for all the information you can find in there, but it is told in a very boring way. All figures will probably be correct, but next time can it be presented in a way which makes it more fun and interesting to read???"
2,Disappointed- bp cuff too small,"I can't rate the accuracy of this unit, as the cuff it comes with is too small. It says on the cuff that it fits 7 3/4""-15 3/4"" arms. My arm is slightly less than 14"" and the readings I got were much too high. I compared this unit with two other bp monitors that I know are accurate, and this one read 25mm high systolic and 15mm high diastolic. If the cuff is too small for your arm, you will get readings that are too high.The only options are to send the unit back or purchase a larger cuff that runs about $20 with shipping. So, measure your arm before you purchase this. If you're an average size man or a woman who is even slightly toward the ""plus"" size, either choose another unit or order the large cuff at the same time you purchase this. This would be a much better product if customers had the option to choose the cuff size when ordering instead of having to purchase a second cuff at additional cost."
3,easy to use useless monitor,"I am sure manual monitors give more accurate results. For some reason, I was under the impression that this one would be a better one, but I am very disappointed. I have to take my blood pressure at least twice to get results which are closer to reality, otherwise I would think that I am dead or getting there: 143/45, 128/43 etc. Future buyers, beware."
4,Size Matters,"Great product, performed as expected and performed very well. Only drawback is the cuff is too small for my arm. 30 readings at home were all 20 points greater than what the nurse and doctor read 3 times in the office, and the practice had just had their BP equipment calibrated that week. Now seeking to find a larger cuff as an accessory."
1,Not for home dialysis,"Not designed for home dialysis. We've taken b/p measurements hourly during xmts for over 20 years. (a)The body of the monitor is round and slick, and is unnecessarily heavily weighted, and can hardly be picked up with one hand; its designed for office desk use. Its especially hard to pick up if you have arthritis. (b)The pre-formed cuff is clumsy, takes two hands, does not make good contact with the arm artery area; I much prefer the old velcro type. (c)Dialystolics are consistently false highs compared to a manual cuff & stethescope. (d)Is too sensitive to even slight missed or irreg beats, so shows Error the majority of the time; have to re-take over and over.We tried pluggung in an older velcro cuff, no help. We returned this product."
3,BT AND TORI AMOS EXPERIMENTAL ROCK-BREAKS...,"BY ITSELF, ""BLUE SKIES"" IS NOTHING SPECIAL...PAUL VAN DYK SAVES THE DAY WITH HIS BLAUER HIMMEL REMIX, AND FOR A NICE SET OPENER, ROBBERS OF ANTIQUITY TURN IN A GROOVY MINIMAL WORKOUT..."
4,"Tori Amos never even sings ""Blue"" or ""Skies"" for this...","Yes its true, believe it. Brian Transeau (BT) is such an adept technical wizard, that he FABRICATED the words ""Blue"" and ""Skies"" from other Tori Amos works, time corrected and pitch corrected them, then wrote a track around it. Brilliant stuff - there's noone who can touch this guy's technical expertise in the studio...noone."
4,Entertaining,"Not a bad movie, but one that ignores the facts of geography. The prison unit where Goldie Hawn breaks her husband out of is, in reality, very close to Sugarland, Tx. Nonetheless, they have to embark on a several day journey to get to Sugarland. And at one point we see a road sign that is in Val Verde County! That is hundreds of miles away. Then at the end of the movie, we are informed that Sugarland is near the Mexican border--it is in reality a suburb of Houston --and indeed Goldie and her husband are seen driving through some West Texas scenery before landing in the Rio Grande. If you can overlook all of that insult to your intellignce, it is not a bad movie, all of that actors are great--- especially Ben Johnson and it is a good slice of Texas culture the way it was about 1969. It would have been better to invent a fictional town in West Texas as their destination. That would have explained the journey of several days and the West Texas scenery at the end of that movie."
5,FUNNY and TOUCHING,I was actually living in Houston when this story occurred. It really was a big deal and happened like the movie depicts. Great movie.
2,Works with certain GBs,"My bf an I started playing the original pokemon games again and wanted to collect them all... so we ordered this little cable in hopes that it will help us achieve our common goal. It works great when me and him trade with his friend's gameboy, but when we try to trade each other it does not work. I have no idea why."
3,Intro to pop/rebel music,"Jim Rooney and Eric Von Schmidt introduce the reader to the early years of beat music and jug band ska that influenced American musicians for the next 40 years. Great details about Bob Dylan, Mimi & Dick Farina, John Sebastian and all the other juggers who defined folk music in the sixties. Well written with great pictures."
2,Trouble with the outside sensor,"I purchased this item at Walmart less than 2 years ago and the outside temperature does not work anymore. I had no trouble with the clock up to this point, but I tried everything the instructions tell you to do and it still is not working. There is just ""---"" on the screen. I've read numerous reviews on this product that state the same problem. The clock looks nice, but it didn't last very long."
1,Doesn't work,"I put in the batteries and waited til the next day to see the time appear - it doesn't work. Heck I have alarm clocks in each bedroom that automatically get the correct time almost instantly when the power goes out. This is a waste of money.I wanted to stand it up on top of my tv console, but it HAS to be hung on a wall.The date is in European format with 7/11 meaning November 7th. I don't see where it can be changed.This is kinda cheap looking when I got it. I expected more for the money.I'm keeping my old, cheaper, better clock above my tv. This one reflects the light from the floorlamp in my room and is very difficult to read compared to any clock I've ever had."
1,disappointment,"As an avid fan of the core fusion series, I was shocked at this dvd. First off, the quality of the filming is atrocious. Often part of the picture is blurred ( I wondered to myself if this was a copy of a copy)...absolutely terrible camera quality. The set is all one tone of yellow and it looks terrible- nothing like the other dvds in the series (I own all of them). I still cannot believe that they released this. As for the workout, it is okay but with a name like power sculpt I was definately expecting a bit more...all in all, save your money to buy something else."
4,excellent work out,"Perfect work out for doing at home, whole body get in shape in the manner of core fusion... i really appreciate it..."
5,Waiting to see all 3 movies now!,Good preview and got me interested in watching trilogy - will probably buy dvds from Amazon shortly. Tested this out to see if computer was adequate for watching video on demand.
4,"Not bad, it's a trailer","The trailer is ok, watch the movies :-) Not much else to add here those are just very good movies. Watch the Hobbit, too."
1,What a deal...,"Oh, swell. I join Amazon Prime and I get to watch a free trailer for LOTR. That was money well spent."
2,An introductory look at the Scopes Trial,"This book provides a very good introduction to the Scopes Case mentioning everything from the plan hatched by George Rappelyea and various Dayton, TN businessmen, to the brilliant yet caustic Clarence Darrow, to the quiet John Scopes. The only bad point to this book is that it is quite one-sided. It portrays William Jennings Bryan as a buffoon,and the country people of Tennessee as illiterate. Bryan was probably the greatest orator of his time as well as a lawyer, not a buffoon. Otherwise this book was very good at giving an overview of the case."
5,excellent,I can't say enough about this book. I learned more here than watching all the programs and research on this subject and recommend that anyone interested on Diana and her death read this.
5,Fascinating,Really enjoy these alternative views. They manage to explain a lot of what the police and the media couldn't. You've got to wonder.
5,Rosanne season 6,For anyone who loves John Goodman -- the whole series is well worth owning. During the series run there were some spots where cast discontent resonated on the screen... but it's short lived. These characters are so much alive and average.With the crap that's on TV these days... reality everything... this sitcom rerun is my saviour! Even on DEJU they only seem to run up to season 4 then go back to the beginning again...Next on my list: Get Smart
5,Love it,Thanks for this product good price and this show never gets old.It came pretty fast too which was great.thanks again
1,watch this and be dysfunctional.,this is a sit com that emulates dysfunctional family. the dialogues are obnoxious. not good for children to watch. you learn to be rude and disrespectful.
3,Fan,"I am a die hard fan of the trilogy, long before the movie came out. The information in the book is brief but enough to make it worthwhile. The pictures, however, are hardly in focus."
5,"Great book, but has spoilers!","If you can't wait one more minute for the movie, I recommend having this book FedExed to help you get through the remaining days. It's got solid content (which includes some film spoilers, so be warned) and images you won't have seen in magazine articles or other publicity. It's very much from the actors' perspective. I particularly enjoyed the revelation of in-character asides between Viggo and Orlando, tucked into the text: when Viggo casts aspersions on the overly-excellent grooming of the Elves, Orlando's comeback is, ""Oh yeah? Well, I'm going to live forever. Got that? Live Forever!""The sole disadvantage is that after reading it, I can't wait one more second for the movie."
2,Lacking!,"I was quite disappointed with this book in that perhaps I expected too much from it. It just basically tells you how the filmmakers managed to finally bring the classic trilogy to the screen, whereas I had hoped to find an in depth 'art of the movie' book with character sketches and conceptual artworks (which they did put in albeit in a minimum amount).I like the movie but this book is just more like a representational coverage on the people behind the scenes than a moviemaking book. I do hope one which suits my taste will come out soon."
3,"A bit dated, and there are others which are better","This book is one of only a few in this field, and for that reason, it is worth reading.it is however showing signs of age, and doesn't provide a lot of hands-on info for those who want to modify their own engines.As a starting point, I would recommend AG Bell's books or Dalton's ""Practical gas flow"" if your interests are in this area.Geoff"
4,Excellent book,"The information in this book is just as relavant now as it was when it was written back in 1972. Physics is physics, after all. The book gave me a much clearer understanding of header theory. My only complaint is that Smith and Morrison obviously wrote this book for engineers, and I'm not one. I had to struggle to understand some of the concepts, particularly on tri-y header design; but in the end, it was definitely worth it. The exhaust concepts are equally applicable to carbs and fuel injection. The only things lacking were crossovers and merge collectors, but I guess those things weren't invented in 1972. This book will give you a basic grounding in header design theory, and will enable you to discern a set of well-designed headers from a useless tangle of pipes. If you plan on building a set of custom headers, this book is definitely required reading."
3,Engine manual,bought this for grandson who is working on rebuilding his old car. New engine and intake and exhaust systems. I am not in a position to evaluate the effectiveness of this manual.
1,an okay book,"this is a very fundamental book on the subject, however, it's easy for a beginner to follow. it lacks the basic equations and theories that describe the intake and exhaust flows. if you are a graduated student, stay away from this book. you would have learned more from fluid dynamics 101 (if you were awake in class). otherwise, this is a good basic, short to the point, easy understanding book....."
2,Stuck in the '60's,"I read the book cover to cover. My impression is that this book contains exhaust and intake design information that was current in the 50's and '60s. Very little information for modern 4 or 5 valve per cylinder engines, and fuel injection tuned intake systems. No information on practical design of V8 performance exhaust system for street emmissions legal exhaust. Needs updated."
1,In desperate need of updating!,"Very outdated. I regret not having read the reviews here prior to purchasing this book. The last time this book was updated was 1972! There is nothing in the way of forced induction. Turbochargers are not mentioned and there is a single reference to superchargers on page 17! ""Fuel Injector"" is mentioned once. I am definitely sending this one back. Not the first time I have been disappointed with Bentley Publishing. FYI, 1972 was the year Pong came out. As I said, the book desperately needs to be updated."
1,Not all the best of,I was very dissapointed with this. I only liked three out 15 tracks. I thought I was getting the chic sound this group is known for. The majority of the tracks sounded very campy and too granola. NOT COOL AT ALL! save your money.
3,Was expecting something different,"Looking back, I am not sure whether my expectations were fair. I had heard a couple of songs on the radio, and thought this would be a good purchase since ""Missing"" is so brilliant. Unfortunately there is not another song in the same vein on the CD.That being said, I find several of the songs good, but they are quite a bit different that what I had expected. Since I am not a huge fan, I am not qualified to judge the quality of the remixes and the songs that were selected for the CD. What I do feel qualified to say is that if you are hoping for a CD that has the feel of ""Missing"" for 15 songs, you will not be getting that. But you will be getting some quality lyrics and feeling, so I don't want to sound like the CD is not good. It is, just make sure you listen to the sound samples before buying."
3,Not what I thought,"This has a few well known songs from this group but the rest were very average, have traded it in as really not that impressed."
5,all time best album ever,"Over several years, I have listened to this album over and over and over and never ever get tired of it. A total emotional rollercoaster that I walk away from each and every time with something new. I can't recommmed it enough. BUY THIS CD!!!"
1,High Hopes....big let down...,"I have been a fan of EBTG for many years and was very much looking forward to ""The Best"" from EBTG. What a disappointment for me when there were only 3 tracks that deserved to be on the ""Best of"" EBTG. Save your time and money. Too bad, these guys are much better than what the CD title leads you to beleive."
1,"Come Back Tracey, Come Back","I am an extremely die hard fan of Everything But The Girl (E.B.T.G.) and knew early on there could never be a best of compilation that would satisfy me. The fact is that their first few albums were their best work-1. Eden (1984) 2. Everything But The Girl (1984) 3. Love Not Money (1985). If you want to know WHAT they sounded like before they sold out, these 3 albums are a good place to start. If you want to hear HOW they sounded at their peak- get these 2 albums: 1. Idlewild (1988) 2. Acoustic (1992). I truly understand one must move with the times and not lag behind in the world of music, hence their recent other Best Of called Adapt or Die, but they abandoned a lot of fans when they sold out to the techno/electronica audience. I miss their early days and wish they would record just one more last album of the old stuff for their old fans- a sort of gift to those of us who were there in the beginning."
4,"Good, melodic album - sadly overlooked","Remembered, if at all, for the really minor alternative hit ""Can You Dig It"", the Mock Turtles' ""Turtle Soup"" is actually a very well-written, catchy pop-rock album that got lost in the Madchester shuffle. ""Kathy Come Home"", ""Mary's Garden"", and a mellow cover of ""The Willow Song"", from the cult film ""The Wicker Man"", are all memorable tunes that measure up to the band's lone semi-hit. There's nothing here you haven't heard before, and singer Martin Coogan's vocals are pleasing if rather nondistinct, but ""Turtle Soup"" remains a lost album of sorts that deserves a better fate."
2,Now I have to replace it,"First the magnet came off, then the alarm broke (doesn't beep). This is awesome because it doesn't make a loud beep every time you hit the minute button anymore, but...alas, the point of a timer is to alert you when your stuff is done. Not reliable."
3,outdated information,"While the book highlights symptoms of ovarian cancer, a subject that needs much more public exposure, be warned that the medical information is several years old. Includes poetry. Not what I expected."
5,pay to collect this stuff,"Yes, these sets are all expensive. True Rolling Stones fans who are die hard collectors will have these regardless as they get hours of happiness from listening to the best band on earth.It should be noted that these are also limited edition releases...and they will be kicking around Amazon for a bit...but the price only flies upward from there.I would urge any fan who wants to see some crazy packaging, great CD quality sound and simply another great add to their collections to consider all these sets, my guess is you can get the first part of the Stones history for about 100.00$ on Amazon...not bad."
5,A Bittersweet Song,"When I hear the melancholic chorus and the simile ""like desert miss the rain"", I can't help but miss her too."
3,So-So,"I just finished reading this book and though it wasn't a page-turner, it wasn't bad. It was a bit more exciting than the last Delinksy book I've read. Reading her back covers, the stories sound as if they're going to be fantastic, but then the book has a tendency to disappoint. They need a bit more excitement and the characters need a bit more personality. It's not a bad read, but not one of the better books I've read."
4,Not bad,I've gotten pretty good at figuring out the ending ahead and was right about this one too but still a good book
1,What a waste!!!,"I purchased this item along with my Garmin iQue M5 I recently purchased and let me tell you, it was the biggest waste of $15 I've ever spent in my life. Upon opening the item, I noticed a cloth along with the instructions, ""wipe screen before application"". So...I followed the directions and then applied, or tried to anyway, the screen protector. The item wasn't very adhesive at all and when I finally did get it to stick, i noticed a piece of dust became lodged under it, and had to remove it. When i attempted to re-apply, it wouldn't adhere at all. I found this humerous as it clearly states in the packaging, ""Washable and reusable"". Anyway, I ordered another one figuring it was some sort of defect, but the same exact thing happened again. It was the biggest $30 mistake I've ever made. If you want screen protection, I recommend the ones made for the PSP. You'll have to trim it a little bit, but they work much better."
4,Loved it,Normally mysteries are not my cup of Twinning's Irish Breakfast but I've read a couple of this lady's novels and I'm always impressed with her writing. She tells a good story and the characters are convincing and enjoyable to read. This is no less true in her latest page turner. Hope you all like it as much as I did.
5,Great,"I purchased this to go along with a new trombone for my son. He had been asking for one so this was just what he wanted. Also, the priced was great because it was less than some others that I had priced. It shipped quickly from the seller which was also good."
1,Errors galore,Purses are all cute...but didn't anyone edit this book?! Once you start knitting you realize that everypattern is filled with mistakes. The publisher's web site has numerous corrections but not all.What a pain in the rear!! I wish I could get my money back...
2,not worth it,there are much better books out there. I was not too happy with this one as it had nothing in it I couldn't get for free on the internet
5,from Canada,"The item got delivered, the quality of item is as promised.The customer service replied to emails.Would advise before shipping to remove previous price tags from the book.When you buy specially if you in Canada make sure to check what are the shipment fees to Canada .They are pretty high in my case I looked just on the shipment fee specified on the site ant it was the US fee and not the international one."
1,Pure fantasy,"This book is nothing but fantasy. The authors laboriously cite ""authorities"" for their various outrageous claims, which authorities are rarely more than citations to anonymous or unnamed confidential ""sources."" It is hard to tell which is more offensive, the extreme paranoid fantasies presented by the authors as ""fact,"" or their expectation that readers will somehow accept their repeated citations to phantom ""authorities."""
1,Incredible Garbage,"Well, here we go again with the secret story of how the gentile world has sought for decades to eliminate the Jewish people. Even though this book is written in a very professional manner, the information is ludicrous and relies heavily on the readers willingness to believe. Discrepancies range from claims of secret technology on board the USS Liberty (that hadn't even been invented at the time), to spy sources who were and must remain secret. Its all a bunch of Zionist propaganda, as if we haven't heard enough already, of how the evil, manipulative and treacherous Christian nations of the world sought the undoing of the peace-loving Jewish people."
1,Unbelievable!,This is one of those books that Zionists praize and everyone else stands there shaking their heads.
5,The authors did a tremendous public service,"That some people may find this book objectionable in no way detracts from it. The authors accessed large numbers of official documents and sources which are listed in a lengthy footnote section.The task that the authors took on was enormous. They investigated highly secretive U.S. government agencies that are the best in the world at what they do. The truth, may in fact, be worse than what appears, due to those secrets that have not been exposed.It is likely that these unsavory activities continue to this day undiminished. What has transpired since the last edition of this book could provide at least a few more lengthy chapters, possibly another book.The corporations of the West have turned the governments of Western countries into entities that more resemble ruthless corporate controlled oligarchies than democracies."
4,"63 year old, playing soccer, with herbal medication.","75% improvement in knee pains, and playing soccer weekly, riding bike 8-10 miles a day. Now 3-4 capsules a day after 1 month of intake."
2,Open Bottle,"I have been using TwinLab Joint Fuel for 15 years. It has not only helped joint pain but has made my skin softer and wrinkle free. (lot of Vitamin C and E in this product) I was delighted to find a good price on Amazon. Unfortunately, the good price didn't pay off since one bottle arrived with seal broken and white flap under cap torn. I would not use that bottle."
5,Best Ever,It arrived on time and in good condition. Best helmet that I have ever used. The adjustable head band makes for easy adjustment.
3,the helmet inside the box,this welding helmet is good for starters and noobs but it isnt for full time use or profesional use because pros its light weight and afordable for 1 time use for home inprovment also easy to adjust for right size but cons is it is hard to change shade of lens ? if even can and it is a little clinky and bulky in nature as for visibilty the flip only goes 90 degrees so it narrows and limits regular vision over all 3 stars because for its price its not the worst but its not the best but at least it works
2,Needs daylight to be able to see the tip,"This thing is dark, you'll need a lot of light to be able to see at what you're pointing or welding. I just bought the auto darkening instead. Get that one for 60 bucks instead of this one."
4,Better than expected,"I dont know what the people before me mean by it's light. This is a pretty solid helmet, other than the headgear. Here in the shop, we have fixed shade helmets ($45) that are more flimsy than this. I'm concerned about the shade of the lens though. It says the shade is #10, but it's not any darker than #9 shade we use in the shop. Thus, the four stars. The clear lens on mine really isnt that thin, as said in the reviews before. I poked it pretty hard after reading those reviews and it stayed in place just fine, barely even bent. This really is a great helmet for new welders, hobby welders, and it's really affordable. Not an everyday helmet, but definately worth the $25! This thing will probly last just as long, if not longer, than the auto-darkening helmets bought for $100+ (as long as you take care of it)"
4,Better than you'd think,"CAVEAT: I am not a professional welder.I've had a number of different welding helmets, a Miller MP-10, a Lowes autodark, and several Hobart hoods. I've always found the cheap Hobart hoods fit the best. Go figure.I use this helmet with a Miller autodark filter for MIG welding. I like that I can flip the lens up to grind or view the work item. it saves wear and tear on my neck. The filter holder is forgiving, and can accept the thick cover plates and an ADF filter without fuss. The helmet is better than you think, and spares are just a farm store away."
1,Unexciting,"This is nothing more than trivia on South Park. A few very lame games are thrown is as ""Bonus rounds"". Very unexciting, and lame. As soon as I turned it on I regretted spending the money to rent it."
2,Little Love From Luv Sack,"This game has poor graphics, large load times, and hard ?'s. Not a good South Park genre."
3,ok game to play when your bored with your other games.,This was a o.k game. controls are a little weird. And it is not as fun if your playing by yourself i would recommend you playing with some friends. Its a pretty good game for any south park fan.
1,A Classic...waste of money!!!,The only reason I keep this game around is to show my fellow game enthusiasts an example of a truly bad game. The implementation is horrid! You spend as much time waiting for the different game segments to load as you do playing the game! It's hard for me to imagine that even hard core fans of South Park would put up with this!!
4,Better than you think.,"This game is fairly good. I am going to write this review in Pros and Cons formation.Pros:Contains real voices from Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and the infamous Isaac Hayes.Doesn't take too long to load. (WHAT OTHERS DON'T THINK)Very funny mini games! (BAD KITTY)Cons:Gets some-what boring after a while.Questions can be repeated during extended play.Graphics look computer-drawn.Overall, the game is pretty good, but only for South Park fans. It may be entertaining, but it has earned an M rating. Don't leave the package aroung children.Thanks."
1,Maybe on another system....,"I must say, this game is a great idea. The games are fun and everything is in the traditional South Park mayhem, mixed with retro-arcade games like Asteroids. Beware of the Playstation version! The loading time makes the game almost unplayable."
3,YOU HAVE TO LOVE SOUTH PARK TO ENJOY THIS GAME,If you don't love South Park you will not like this game! If you love South Park you will like this game. The trivia questions are sometimes hard. The games are kind of lame but funny and remind me of the old atari games. The characters talk like they do in the show and a lot of the questions are about the show. If you dont watch South Park dont buy this game you probably wont find the humor in it.
1,"Don't Bother, No really!","This is the worst video game I've seen in long time. Not only is the game nullifying boring with arcane questions about unrelated and meaningless trivia subjects, it also fails on a technical level, as you have to wait for it to load from the PlayStation CD Rom frequently throughout the game. The brief South Park moments are nothing special either, with hardly any actual humor, but just canned Kyle and Cartman messages. The bonus games are moronic. The concept is good, but the execution fails on every count."
2,Fun the first couple times,"The first time I played this game I loved it, then the novelty wore off. There are not enough questions in the quiz rounds - questions were being repeated by the 3rd time I played. Also, you should be able to play the mini-games without going through the quiz. When I bought the game I thought it was simply a bunch of games, not games within games. Also, the best mini games (Bad Kitty, etc.) are only available if you are in 1 Player mode, and I bought the game so we could have a good 2 Player game. That said, the questions are very funny (the first couple times), as are the sounds during the games."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This game is mildly fun...for about 30 minutes. Of course, it takes nearly that long to load any of the trivia rounds or mini-games. The questions are repeated frequently and overall this game is not the least bit challenging. Trust me, rent it first and if you play it for a few hours you'll get all you can out of the game so don't waste your money on buying your own!"
3,Suffers in comparison with Boswell's writing,"There is some value in reading this book, but he writing is somewhat repetitive and is not as satisfying as reading Boswell's own journals. I found myself reading the same thoughts over and over."
5,Challenging and beautiful,got this book as a christmas gift. what a treat! it is in full color with challenging puzzles for those kinds of people that are good with spatial abilities.
5,Gorgeous Magazine,"-A beautiful magazine.-Includes U.S. sources for British designers and home furnishings.-Sponsors fabulous house and garden tours in England.-I leave past issues around the house, and guests ooo and ahhh over the magazine."
5,English Home Magazine,"I am so enjoying English Home Magazine, well written articles and food section. Being a Brit living in America, its wonderful to travel back through the pages. To follow someone re buidling a cottage to make it theirs. Reading what its like to be a caretaker of a castle and actually living in it.I am reading it from Page to page and enjoying all the wonderful photos."
3,Holidays NOW???,"I think that The English Home is a beautiful magazine. It features lovely homes, English countryside, and interesting focus on details of English life, both current and past. BUT....I just received the December issue on October 6th. We haven't even thought about Halloween yet! What in the world is the advantage in sending a magazine out three months in advance? I find it a bit off-putting."
1,Book is hopelessly dated and eccentric,"As a web designer and the owner of many technical books, this is by far the worst I've come across. According to a recent survey of millions of websites over 80% of visitors now employ Internet Explorer to browse the web. Only about 5% use Netscape 4.x which is the EXCLUSIVE domain of this book. Some book examples will not work at all in Netscape 6 or any IE product. So for those of you designing websites for 5% of the market you should buy this book definitely.If you want to reach the other 95% of the market then you should look elsewhere.Even the author's website (http://users.sedona.net/~gilorien/) has been under construction since I've owned the book. I agree with an earlier reviewer who said this guy would be out of a job had it not been for the publisher of this book."
3,I use it as a reference,"Ouch! Most of the reviews seem to trash this book. I've had this book for many years and I use it as a reference source for CSS syntax, and obscure properties. The CD comes with the examples already typed in and they work. Layers are an interesting concept and fun to try. The used book price was at less than $5 as I write this and that would be a great bargain for a reference book."
2,I Don't like this book much,"This book does serve for a decent reference for seeing how to use code, but the theory is nonexistent. It basically says here is some code and this is what its doing. There are very few paragraphs that are not explaining code. It doesn't tell why to do things nor what is and isn't bad code. Other reviewers were right when they called this book bizarre. To the books benefit I did learn quit a bit from reading it. If you have object programming experience or are familiar with object programming ""JavaScript The Definitive Guide"" from O'Reilly publishing is a much better book."
2,High Hopes,"This book has a lot of examples. So many that most people would not use all of them for 5 different webpages. The only problem is it is not user friendly. Good for someone who knows the language, but NOT reccommended for a person trying to learn the language."
1,Horribly written book,"I purchased this book and in the first few days of actually reading it, I found that it contained very little information about how and why to use DHTML. Sure it had a good reference but without context, this book is completely useless. As soon as you open the book to read it, you realize at how poorly it was written. The book gave no context and you really have no idea what the technology is or what its used for.Definitely not recommended."
1,Horrible!,"This has got to be one of the worst books ever. What a waste of money! What's the point of a Netscape centric book in today's web development world? The sample code doesn't even work all of the time in Netscape 4! (I also love how the author submitted the 5 star review) If you want to waste your money and be totally confused, buy it today!"
1,Purchase only if you hate IE users,I was very disappointed that this book only covered DHTML (JavaScript and CSS) that worked with Netscape. I was hoping for something that would work in both NS and IE. The one good thing about the book is the author does tell you about Netscape bugs that force you to change the syntax of your JavaScript.
2,Not very simple !,The outline of the book is not very linear. If you are an experienced web programmer maybe you'll use some of the tables of styles but everything else is hard to find and there's not much detail on how to use the method's. If you're a beginner to Styles and Html the only thing you will use is the little html tutorial at the end of the book.I do not recommend this book to a person who wishes to buid stylish web pages in an user centered form because it focuses mainly in programming for Netcape 4+ (not NS6).If you enjoy using the index every 5 minutes buy it otherwise don't !
2,Where's the beef?,"Although this book does contain a reasonable reference to CSS and JavaScript (as implemented by Netscape ONLY), the information is well hidden in this verbose and sometimes misleading if not ocassionally inaccurate volume. The author introduces most topics with descriptions of their syntax, usually failing to get to what the darned things (layers, for example) are actually used for until well into the chapter, by dropping it casually somewhere. I have read hundreds of technical books, and this is by far the most bizarre to date. The author often apologizes that this stuff is (sic) ""kinda tricky"", but assures you that if you look at the sample code closely you will get idea. I see."
2,It was OK. Got my attention and then totally lost it...,"This book was OK. It did have interesting points, but I didn't feel that all the characters were credible (who could get away with killing a whole bunch of people in Mexico anyway?).All in all, it was reading entertainment, just not too fullfilling."
4,A great followup book to Diamond Head.,"The main character, John Caine, moves to San Diego and Mexico for his next case and gets involved in a multitude of plot twists and action along the way. I liked this book almost as much as the author's first, Diamond Head. I can't wait for Charles Knief's next book."
1,Lied about being sterling silver,"I really liked the rings design but it rusted after about 3 days of use.. Due to the price, i was expecting it to be good quality.. Do not recommend at all"
5,Indeed life changing!,"I watched this video many yrs ago and STILL call to mind the imageries it has indelibly imprinted on my spirit. Reading the Word, the gospels in particular as well as just imagining Jesus as I talk to Him has been heightened and is so much more rich. Won't it be so amazing to see Him one day! for reals!? YES! You will not be the same after seeing this version of Matthew. It's important to know that the script is 100% the Word of God, and yet it's not dry... it's riveting."
3,At first I really liked it,"but after seeing it a few times, the protrayal of Jesus seemed to get too shallow. There's a few solid scenes, but there's too much frosting on this cake."
1,Loses connection with remote temperature sensor,"I have had this product for about 3 months, in that time I've had to reset the connection between the remote sensor and the unit 3 times. This is not an easy process, the sensor is outside (obviously). You have to take the batteries out of both the clock and the sensor, then put them back in (first the sensor then the clock). Takes me a good 20 minutes each time (and on one occasion I had to repeat the whole thing twice). Then after a week they lose contact again! It's a good-looking clock, but essentially worthless to me as a way to know the temperature outside."
2,"Huge display, but La Crosse products last only about 2 years","The atomic clock and temperature gauge is very large in size. Great for someone with poor long distance eye site. Keeps time well and works well while it lasts. Unfortunately, I've experienced about a maximum two year life span with the two other La Crosse clocks and temperature gauges I've purchased. These products simply don't last very long. I bought this one as a gift for my father who operates a farm. He seems to use it a lot."
2,Disappointing,This unit is impossible to read at an angle. The LCD screen is old-school; you have to look at it almost dead-on to read it. It also has a hard time tuning in the atomic clock to reset itself each night. I was unable to mount the unit on the wall where I wanted it because it can't find the atomic clock signal each night. I had to mount it on a wall 90 degrees to the left of the wall I wanted to mount it on. All in all a real disappointment.
1,Looks good but only worked three days.,La CrosseeTechnology WS-8157U-CH-IT Atomic clock with outdoor Temperature and Weather ForecastSet up easy but on the third day the outdoor temperature read on degree hotter that indoors. Sorry but not in Texas in the summer.Trying to have them send me another on but no contact info.
2,Attractive item,"Hard to read.Numbers etc.,need to be bolder or larger.Very hard to read past 5 feet."
3,its ok,"The product doesnt have a backlight which would be helpful. maybe I havent set it right, but it keeps changing the time to 2hrs ahead of our CST. What's up w/that?"
5,Very cool and I love it!,This item is wonderful! My dad got one a few years back and I just had to get one as well!
3,Outdoor temperature sensor doesn't work,"Classy looking, and it automatically set itself to the atomic clock after a couple of hours. But the outside temperature sensor won't work no matter what I do. I see this is a ubiquitous problem with these clocks. The outdoor temperature wasn't that big of a deal to me, so I'm keeping the clock rather than going to the hassle to return it, but I'd hesitate to buy from La Crosse again."
5,Outside brought inside.,Got the clock for a friend. She loves it and so do I! Love knowing out to dress before going outside and testing the temp.Nice wood trim and large display tells you everything you want to know relative to inside/outside temp and humidity. Outside temp sensor mounts easily
5,Best atomic weather clock ever,"Has all the features I want, the weather display really works, nice large numerals, and looks great on the wall."
2,Bad experience.,I receive this clock defective and talk with company representative with tell me to send it back for replacement for my expenses. Post office tell me that would be cost $30. That make this clock cost ruffly twice more that make this purchase not worthy.M.Kantor.
1,Oily screen\limited distance,"This product arrived with what looked like some sort of oily film on the back of the screen (see pic in cust images) that caused a rather distorted view of read out. I contacted la crosse and they requested I send pictures and they responded that I should send unit back to them at ""my"" expense. Won't be buying any more la crosse products.1-27-13: Another minus for this product. Sending unit won't work when temps below 30 degrees unless it's within 6'-8' of receiver. Even with new batteries in both units the functional distance between units is very limited in moderately cold weather. As stated before....no more la crosse products for me."
2,Don't waste your money,"The La Crosse atomic clock looks great. Smaller than the one I had for years before but still could read the time from more than 10 ft away. The problem, like other reviewers complain, is the outside sensor. I stuck mine in my window frame behind the screen thinking that it would be fairly protected from the rain and snow. Nope. It stopped working after the first rainfall. Ok, so I had a nice wall clock. No again, the new Duracell batteries lasted only 4 months, and I am not going to waste any more."
4,does the job,"Works fine, but the weather forcast is often off. It has said sunny when its snowing etc... the temp is sometimes off outside as well, but that could be because the sensor is against the building? Still, all in all it looks nice and gives you a general idea of the temp and weather."
5,"Know how to ""bundle up"" just by looking at this hanging on the wall!","One of the greatest products I've ever purchased and invested in!La Crosse makes a very good product!This unit was ordered through Amazon and shipped & received in a timely manner and was well packaged!Took it out of the box, installed the batteries, hung the outdoor sensor and before you realized it the clock was set and the indoor and outdoor temp was displaying! Am thinking about purchasing 2 (two) more of these as gifts for my two married children.Not only is it an item of great use (one that keeps on giving) but it also has ""style"" with the wood sides, nice large digital display and ease of set up (just follow the included instructions)."
3,La Crosse Atomic Clock with Outdoor Temp. and Weather Forecast WS-8157U-CH-IT,"The LaCrosse Atomic clock works well. The inside temperature and weather forecaster also do very well. The outside temperature always reads 5 degrees warmer. Checked it with two other outdoor thermometers, moved the outdoor unit out of the sun to a full shade area, no change. I still like the unit. Will look at a replacement outdoor sending unit."
1,atomic clock,I purchased this clock this year and it never stays the way I set itit is not working properly.I would like it replaced.thank youJOhn Centunzi
1,Completely worthless!,"I wanted this sensor so I could read outdoor temperatures. It will not pick up the signal from the remote sensor. I have changed the batteries, followed the instructions to the letter, and still no signal. So it's little more than an expensive digital clock. And I will shop for a similar item from another manufacturer so that I can monitor outdoor temps."
4,Great Clock,I love the aesthetics and the accuracy is great. I particularly like the barometer function that lets me know graphically what is in store weather wise. By that I mean whether the weather is going to get better or worse. Of course I bought it because of the atomic clock feature which works just fine at my home and at the home of the person I gifted one to.
2,after all..using it as a basic clock,"it looks nice!.displays the time OK and ..that's about it.indoor doesn't connect to the Colorado station to synchronize for the exact timeand most drawback would be the ext. temp that is displayed by like 10-12F off!..and theweather icon is stuck on rain/raining clouds from day one,although outside is sunny as it could get!I'm using it here in sunny Phoenix,Az.too much of a hassle to return it so..I'll keep it,but too bad,would be nice if it would work as advertised,"
4,nice clock,"This is a nice clock. large numbers and icons and syncs itself to the time signal from WWV by radio. The remote outside unit could be a bit smaller and more waterproof, but I solved that problem by putting it inside a class mason jar."
3,Not bright enough to read!,"I purchased this wall clock to replace an LED clock that took a power surge and died. I really like the overall look of the this clock and it was very easy to set up. The only problem is that the led lights aren't bright enough! I had it hanging on a wall about 20 feet from my couch and the only thing that I could read was the time, not any of the other features and this was in the middle of the day! I ended up taking it down off of the wall and placing it on the mantle because there is a light above it so now I can see all the displays. If I would have known that this clock was going to end up on the mantle, I would have purchased something that resembled a mantle clock. Unless this is going in a super bright room, I'd look elsewhere."
2,Outdoor temperature problems,"This was my first, and second experience with LaCrosse Atomic Clocks. In both instances, the outdoor sensor did not work properly. In addition, this sensor requires the sensor not be exposed to elements. What's up with that? Next to the house gives you erroneous information. Tuesday I woke up and the temperature outside read 60 degrees--except it was 23 below! So I took the second clock back, go a refund, and I am going back to Sharp, which I had no trouble with."
4,Large Clock - Temperature Sensor,"This product works as advertised, and although it is all plastic it doesn't look cheap. The only surprise I had was the size, this thing is huge (check the dimensions). We have had it for a month now and it works great."
3,It's Okay,I bought this clock to replace one given to me three years ago. I wanted one that would not be unsightly on my mantle and would give me the proper time. Sadly minimal instructions were given. I do not need the outdoor temperature gizmo and wish I could have purchased the clock only.
2,Needs back light,"This clock badly needs to be back-lit. (It doesn't really look like the clock in the picture.) You have to step very close to it to read anything other than the time of day. Also, the ""stands-alone"" mechanism is very flimsy and unstable."
4,La Crosse Atomic clock,The clock presented well on the wall and matched our decour. The weather forecast and date functions were addtional features that we were looking for when purchasing this clock. The numbers are large enough to be seen from across a room. Our only complaint is that the background is grey and the numbers become very hard to see in dim light.
4,...or share an image. La Crosse Technology WS-8157U-CH-IT Atomic Clock with Outdoor Temperature and Weather Forecast,"Ordered this weather station/atomic clock when I determined it was the old station that was broken not the sensor. This one works fine however after I got this one my kitchen station broke, too. It was only 4 years old so I am getting skeptical about the quality of the La Crosse atomic clocks/weather stations. This may well be the last I purchase."
1,Did not pickup radio signal.,I could not get the clock to receive the atomic radio signal where I tried a Skyscan clock that did pickup the signal. I returned the La Crosse for a refund.
1,not reliable,"I was pleased to get this clock because it looks very nice! Unfortunately, it does not operate nicely! it's a little bit difficult to program which would have been fine if it had been reliable enough that i only had to do that once in a while. I had this clock what could be measured in weeks not months and i had to replace the batteries already once. Then it appeared the batteries were out again, only to find it actually stopped running altogether. Additionally, it took a few days for the atomic feature to kick in and update with the time change....the atomic feature was one of my primary reasons for getting this clock so that's a bit of bummer! I can't recommend it despite the cool features and appearance."
4,Good Box for as long as it works,This is the third La Crosse Atomic Clock that I have owned. The first ran fine for 5 years when finally new batteries failed to recover communication between the indoor and outdoor units. Bought a new one (same model) which worked for about a year when it developed the same symptoms. Now we're on the third edition and we'll see if it's any better.
1,Not a reliable clock,I got it in August 2009 and threw it away last week. It was not efficient---very battery consuming. It stopped working properly last week. I ended up with a chaotic morning because the time it showed was one hour behind!!! Don't buy it.
2,Frustrating,Frustrating to get it working and to fix it every time it fails !!Whats with having to press a button 20 times !! among other weird troubleshooting methods.
5,Love this product,This is our 2nd LaCrosse weather station and we just love it. Had the 1st one for 5 yrs. We look at it everytime we walk into the room. Everyone should have one.
4,OK so far,"I just bought this as my first atomic clock. I love the idea. I had originally bought a smart clock; but a year later, when the government changed day light savings time, I had to change my clock four times a year instead of twice a year. My only gripe with this atomic clock is that you can't use rechargeable batteries with it; otherwise, I think it's great."
5,I Didn't Think I'd Like it This Much,"I bought this for us for Christmas. I thought ""he"" would like it and maybe add it to his desk. Instead we keep it in the kitchen. It's larger than I thought it would be (I don't remember if I read the size). We look at it all the time. Especially in the morning before work, how cold is it, should we remote start, etc. It turned out to be rather fun and it also makes for a handy clock."
5,indoor outdoor clock,"I absolutely love this clock. I love being able to get up in the morning and see how cold or hot it acually is outside.Also love not having to walk up to it to see the time or temperatures, it is readable in the kitchen from the living room and the front door, Well done thank you!!!"
4,La Crosse Technology WS-8157U-CH-IT Atomic Clock with Outdoor Temperature and Weather Forecast,"I returned this item because it would not keep the correct time. I have owned these clocks for years and this is the first time I had a problem with the item. However, I did not loose faith in the product. I ordered another clock like this one; only difference is it has the light oak wood. I have not had any problems with the new clock. THANKS!"
