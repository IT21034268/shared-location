2,"Will get you started, but...","...maybe not the fault of the book, but Visual Studio support for UML isn't that great. In practical use, it is very frustrating and limited. Break out of Visual Studio and get Sparx Enterprise Architect for UML work."
3,"UML yes, but",I do not think that the title of this book is appropriate. The book is about UML but i question the professional bit in the title. The writing is okay but you can tell that different authors worked on the book. Had the book been a little more coherent I would have opted for 4 stars.
5,A Great Programmers Guide,If you're a VS.NET Enterprise developer and are faced with a complex development project that you're struggling to get your head around this is the answer!Having read other UML books I found them to be overly accademic but armed with book I can go from my diagrams straight into an automaticialy generated application shell.Fantastic!Ms Saeko Sekikawa
3,Better Than Most,"Of the technically oriented books I've read lately, this has been among the most accessible, well written and informative; that being said, there are still a significant number of errors and omissions in the writing itself, along with grammar and usage problems. I know these books have a limited lifespan, and getting the information in front of people quickly is important, but when confusion arises about the subject matter because of careless writing, it ends defeating the purpose of the book, which is to provide trusted guidance for the subject matter. The problems I've run into are things that a simple proofreading (or even just the author's own review) should have discovered. Anyway, better than most."
3,Could cover more on UML,"The book is OK but you really need a book devoted to UML in particular to really make use out of the material in this book.If you plan on using Visio's UML addin and you want to generate code for a Visual Studio.NET project, you'll need the tool called Kerato. Kerato synchronizes the code generated by Visio's UML addin with code in your Visual Studio.NET project. Kerato will make sure that any changes you make in your UML model will be reflected in your permanent code. This is something the UML addin can't do. Kerato will also synchronize the documentation. ..."
3,corelle livingware,"I love the dinner plate, cup and bowl. However,the salad plate is the size of a coffee cup saucer. It's just a little small for a salad plate."
4,Classic Corelle,"This service for four has all the qualities you're looking for in basic corelle dinnerware, i.e. durability, easy cleaning, simply pattern. However, I find the undersized salad/desert plate unappealing: 8.5"" would have been better for plates to use everyday. As one other review suggests, the mugs which come with the set are more gray than white in color, and do not match the white of the set. If this is going to bother you, I would choose a different corelle pattern or series.Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware Round 16-Piece Set, Service for 4, Chili Red"
5,Very satisfied,Arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I have enjoyed Corelle dishes for many years. Stack compactly and never chip. I wanted to update and love The Cafe Red. I purchased 12 place settings.
5,I can't believe these dishes!,"These dishes are so wonderful.Thin, lightweight, easily stackable.But weird, I'm used to stoneware. you can see THROUGH these dishes almost.Don't get me wrong, I love them, but they are super thin. The red is brighter than in the picture. I'd associate it with Christmas red.My stoneware matched the dishes well.I love them, and I dono't see any drawback to these dishes.Best part is, my kids can't break them. ;)"
5,"Quick delivery, low price","I bought this set for my grandmother's new apartment. It stacks very compactly in her smallish kitchen and it's lightweight and easy for her to handle. The red stripes give character, and it's a neutral style that pretty much anyone could use. Shipping was quick and the items were well packaged. I wouldn't worry about the reviews from a couple years ago that said that it arrived broken. And this was by far the lowest price I found.One other thing, if you haven't seen this set in person, the red stripes are bright red."
4,Light and cute dishes!,"I love these dishes but find the bowls a bit small. the cups are a nice size but are made from stoneware,I don't care for them as much."
4,Made in the USA,"I love Corelle it's thin and durable and space saving. I bought this set because I love red. and WOW it's made in the USA. I was however very disappointed with the mugs that came with the set, The mugs are stoneware and worse made in China. If you like Corelle I suggest you buy all you want now before this company also moves to China."
2,Mugs are different than the ones illustrated in the Amazon site.,"The description of the item in the Amazon website is deceiving. The cups advertised match the design of the plates, and the ones I received are solid red, made of a much heavier material, and made in China. I chose this set as opposed to other sets offered by Corelle because I liked the design of the mugs. So, I am disappointed,"
3,Black marks don't come off,"For some reason, Corelle gets black marks that cannot be removed. I use paper plates between them when I store them but still get the marks mostly on the cups. I still like them anyway because they are light weight and do not take up much room in the cupboard. Many patterns also."
1,Weeks later and still hasn't arrived.,"I would love to review this product, but Amazon first provided me with an incorrect delivery date, then said it was lost but they took the liberty of placing a replacement order for me ""at no charge"" meaning ""no additional charge. Service and shipping have really gone downhill."
2,message in time recordable clock,"I was dissappointed in this product. I was hoping to get the same product my sister received as a present which has a different recorded message for each hour. I was planning to have each of our children and grandchildren announce an individual hour for my wife. This product allows only one message to be recorded and plays the same message every hour. I suppose, like many other companies in today's economy, you are saving money by cutting back on quality and offering us junk for the same price! Too bad - the other product was really a great gift."
1,Disappointed Grammy,"Years ago I had a recordable wall clock that had a different message at each hour recorded by the grandchild whose picture was beside that same hour. It was one of my favorite possessions. Through a series of mishaps, the clock needed to be replaced, and I was excited to find it available for only $33.94 including shipping and handling. NOT!!!! This clock records only ONE message that plays each and every hour. Very, very disappointing."
2,Only one recordable voice for all 12 hours,I purchased this clock thinking that it was the same one I purchased a few years ago for my uncle who is blind. This one only allows one message. It is repeated every hour. This does not help as he needs us to tell him the time at the top of each hour.
4,Timeless Treasures,Timeless Treasures Recordable Wall Clock - was the perfect gift to our parents. We put pictures on the hour of each of the grandchildren and had them record a message to our parents. My parents loved the gift. It's a timeless treasure to capture the grandchildrens voices at an early age.
5,Finally!,I have been looking for this clock for 2 years. Thank you for the swift delivery of this treasured piece. We love it.
4,So Far So Go,"After only a month with the A6040n it seems to be performing very well for a sub-thousand dollar PC running a brand new operating system (Vista).I was forced to buy now because my previous Pentium 4 running XP was either too overloaded with programs and memory-robbing routines, or just old and tired. I tried system fixing software and even reloading XP to no avail.Since the A6040n isn't loaded down with anywhere near the programs my old PC had, I can't give it an unqualified recommendation, but given the features and the price, PLUS a $75 Amazon rebate on top of HP's $50 rebate, I'm happy and think it is well worth the money."
5,HP Pavilion A6040N Desktop PC,After one month I am very satisfied with my purchase of the HP Pavillion Desktop PC. The speed is outstanding.
1,"Horrible customer service, many problems with PC",I bought this last November and it was trouble free until February. It then began to reboot or freeze up once a day during light browsing.I have spent about 30 hours of my own work on this PC either on the phone with tech support or by reloading the OS and then reloading all other s/w and settings.I finally was assigned my own Account Manager. They made it so difficult to get through to someone who could get something done it was unbelievable. I had to spend 30 hours on my own before they would fix.I sent it to Texas and just got it back. Another problem. There was no signal on my monitor. I plugged the monitor and it worked. Called tech support and spent another hour with them to determine the video card now needs replaced. I called the ever powerful Acct Manager and they are closed at 5 MST.I can't believe how many times while on hold I heard about their award winning service.It was horrible. My last HP didn't havce these problems.
3,"Great computer, horrible operation system","I have been an HP fan for years. That said, this computer has given me gray hair in a very short period of time. The computer may be great, but the Vista operating system loaded on it is a piece of junk. Any software you already have won't work, some of your hardware may not work for lack of Vista supported drivers (including some of HP's own equipment, and all the things you were used to with XP now look and work differently. Trying to load the software that came with my HP printer caused my cd/dvd drive to stop working. Buy the computer, but convert it to XP."
2,Not at all what I was looking for.,"I was really expecting some in-depth scripts here. Instead, it was mostly short paragraphs of ""script"" & almost entirely metaphors."
4,informative,This book was very informative and has allowed me to better understand the methods involved to write myt own personal scripts. THe layout (two columns ) for the actual scriupts is a little strange to me but you get used to it. I recommen this book to those looking for scriptig ideas or base kowledge.
5,Straight to the point to get results,"This is not just another book of random scripts. I have already rewritten, adapted and used some of them to suit me and they felt, ""comfortable"". They provide a firm basis and the style is consistent. I would not expect to read all of the scripts but use them to repair and replace some of the weaker scripts that I already use and to develop new ones as required.I found the approaches described very competent and pragmatic with no unnecessary window-dressing designed to impress the client but rather to get results with as little fuss as necessary. I feel more confident having absorbed some of the general philosophy of the book.------------------------------------------------2nd year acupuncture student under Naomi Elizabeth ShuchterBest instructors ever: Bill Mertin, Anna Louisa Anselmo, Naomi Shuchter"
5,An immediate way to incorporate trance into therapy,"I really began appreciating this book after attending an Ericksonian hypnotherapy workshop. The induction scripts are good examples of the different kinds of inductions and are usable as written. The metaphors (where the work gets done) are also very useful as is but as you get more experienced they make great bases for customized scripts. The chapter ""on doing hypnotherapy"" is one of the best introductions to the art I've seen. This is the one book I use regularly while doing therapy with clients."
4,Solid book,"Buy this book before going on to Alekhine's massive collection of games from 1908-1937. If Alekhine's rather imperious style of annotation doesn't exasperate you, you can buy everything he ever wrote without impunity. This book is cheap and worth the money. (A rare Dover chess book written in algebraic notation.)"
4,The middle ground.,"Though this book has a few chess gems to be enjoyed by everyone, this book isn't for the mere beginner. Sometimes it isn't even for the average player. Alekhine's annotations are thorough, for the most part, but are often tinged with either mocking condescension or complete blase. He tacitly assumes that certain tactical or strategic ideas are obvious, and therefore fails from time to time in teaching the reader anything. The games are often interesting, though, again, not for the player interested in only an occasional game. This is a relatively good book if you have enough experience and can study it deeply, but if you are looking for a book of instruction, look elsewhere."
4,Good book,"What I love about this book is it shows Alekhine in a more modern era, how he analyzed more of the modern openings that were starting to emerge. His annotations are always great, and at this price, get it!"
2,"107 CHESS BATTLES, ONLY 30 PLAYED BY ALEKHINE","Overall good book, Alekhine gives his comments on these 107 games played during his time. He does a great job at revealing the players way of thinking and the hows and whys of each move. However, the title of this book is very misleading, potential buyers are led to beleive that Alekhine actually playes all 107 games. He only plays 30! If you want purely games of Alekhine, spend your money on something else"
1,This is the Wrong Model !!,"The description is for the Model 24120, not the model shown. This model is smaller and will not shred Floppy Disks. I'm currently shipping one back because of the incorrect description."
2,I don't like it,This inverter has a fan that keeps running even when the invertner is not in use. This can seriously drain your battery if you accidentally leave it plugged in when not using it.
4,Excellent Pizza Pan,"This pizza pan does an excellent job in browining the crust on my Chicago Deep Dish Pizzas. I simply coat the surface with olive oil before placing the dough in the pan, always bake at 450 on the bottom rack, and the best part is, the cooking time is about 7 minutes less than on my previous pan, and everything is fully cooked. Cleanup is a snap.UPDATE: I've been so happy with this pizza pan, I just ordered a second one from Amazon.com. If you are a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza fan, and want to make this awesome pizza at home, you will not be disappointed with the Chicago Metallics Deep Dish Pizza Pan."
5,Best hymn singer I know,"I've listened to many songs before, but boy, no one can sing hymns like Ortega. His voice would not be as good for other contemporary Christian music but is just perfect when it comes to hymns. I've actually bought many of this particular CD as gifts to my friends. Other CD's of his are so so, but this one is my favorite. I'm about to buy some more."
5,Excellent,An excellent album and one we've come to enjoy and share with family and friends...who likewise have come to appreciate Fernando's solemn and honoring music. Also highly recommend his Under His Wings album.
3,It is okay for my use but not for long term use,Not five (5) stars because some of the numbers are already rubbing off... I only needed 1 set of numbers so used best ones
3,Snow White Doll,The skirt was too short. I made red velvet pants to go underneath so the panty would not show.
5,Awesome book!,"This book is a great, SPECIFIC, guide, which is a rarity. It is a quick, fun read, and it is helpful in giving awesome detailed nuggets of info that really help you out with the ladies, lol! It goes beyond the obvious with great tips about things like 'landscaping,' buying lube, picking out toys, as well as basic anatomy with diagrams and everything! Besides for giving great info, this book is hilarious. Its the second book I've bought from this author, and it doesn't disappoint! This is a great resource for anyone like me, who is fairly new to the mysteries of the 'box lunch,' although I'm sure that even the pros would learn a few new things from this book."
4,very informative,"A worthwhile read, will enlighten both you and your lover. Short and well written. Very informative and descriptive. A true page turner, but I recommend reading in bed with your lover to follow the author's directions."
4,Good INFO,"I must say this book is a must for all oral sex lovers. Great guide for doing a good job ""down There"" a must read for anyone!!!"
1,Good for putting you to sleep,This book spends one chapter on technique. Need I say more? The rest is Sex 101 information. If you're looking to learn how to improve your technique I suggest you just ask your partner for direction rather than read this.
1,Doesn't get to point...,"I really didn't like this book,the author spends all of her time either talking about herself of her girlfriends,she seems to fill up the book with other stories then to talk about technique in depth,and the only chapter in book that talks about technique has nothing in it!...her descripton of the clitoris is mixed up,and her writing style is confusing...the drawing of the vagina is not clear at all it's not well drawn it looks weird...And although this book seems to be targeted for both straight men and lesbians in fact it is more for lesbians!..."
3,The Whole Story,"I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviewer who said not to buy this. If you watch the original concert closely you can tell that it was edited and that there are missing songs. This tape completes the concert, and not only are the missing songs here, but the backstage performances that were aired but not included are also on this tape. Ironically, two of my favorite songs, ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"", by the Platters and ""Whispering Bells"" by the Del-Vikings were ommited from the original version. I am happy to have them now on this tape. My verdict; if you loved the original concert, you must buy this also. Think of it as filling the gaps and restoring the outakes, if you will. My only regret is that it is currently only available on VHS. I want my DVD!!! Gary Stewart at Rhino Records, are you listening!!! You made a lot of my Doo-Wop dreams come true. I hope you make this one come true also. I am looking forward to ""More Doo Wop 51"" on DVD also!"
3,Good complement to Doo Wop at 51,"I enjoyed watching the missing songs from the dvd ""doo wop at 50"". The Platters, Johnny Maestro and The Marcels were great.Why the songs were not added to the original dvd to make the concert ""complete"" is a mystery because they obviously had roomfor it.Also one slight problem.The video box says the tape is 70 minutes. Not true.It's only 43 minutes in length."
5,A must!,"Simply a must for every slide guitar player. Along with vol. 1, this DVD really gets you to improve your bottleneck-style ability."
5,the strongest hook around,"this is the only hook I've found that will stay attached to my shower wall with my shower caddy and my million bottles of shampoo, conditioner and what-nots hanging from it. it's not the most stylish looking thing, but it does the job."
5,Love these!,"We bought these to use until we could get permenant towel bars up, but have been so pleased with them they will find another permenant home. The rubberized surface holds towels so they don't end up on the floor. The only thing I don't like is they can sometimes be hard to find in stores!"
1,So much hype--Don't get sucked in . . .,"Boy, was I impressed when I read how effortlessly the Command bathroom accessory products stuck to tile. I shouldn't have been.First, my husband installed the ""3M Command 17603B Large Shower Caddy with Water-Resistant Strips."" He did not put any bottles in it--nothing. Within two hours I heard a huge CLUNK in the bathroom shower. It fell off the wall!Same thing happened with the soap dish in my son's shower--with no soap in it. CLUNK!I can't believe all the trouble I will go to, to return these items. Don't waste your time!!"
2,Came up as a recommendation but was WAY too big for the application,"I ordered the 3M bathroom hook, based on one of your automated recommendations when I put the shave mirror in my cart. I assumed that since it was recommended that it would work with the mirror. It does not. It is much too big for the mirror and now I'm stuck with a giant hook that I paid for, and don't want to pay to ship back. Disappointed. Needs to be fixed."
1,did not stick to my shower door,"I affixed this hook to my shower door per instructions and the next day it fell off. It seems to want to stick to everything else, now it's sticking to the inside of my trashcan."
1,Product FAILURE,"I purchased this hook from Amazon and it was delivered quickly. Following the installation instructions to a tee, I mounted the hook above the far end of the tub/shower (farthest from the shower head), waited several hours for it to cure, then hung a brand new shower cleaning unit from the hook. This unit was well under the weight limit touted on the hook description page and packaging.This set up with a different hook system has worked fine in our other bathroom. Not so for this hook. I heard a crash in the bathroom a short while ago and found that my brand new $20 shower cleaner unit had fallen to the tub floor, breaking in the process. The ""Water resistant Command hook"" was lying on the bathroom floor, too.This hook has now cost me about $25 in its purchase price plus the cost of the new but broken shower cleaning unit. I am NOT happy and feel that other potential buyers should be aware of this hook failure."
3,Doesn't stick to all surfaces,Tried this on a concrete wall and it fell off on its own without anything even hooked to it. I then tried it on a wooden door. I waited an hour to try hanging anything. But the first towel I tried caused the hook once again to fall off the survace. Finally I tried on a tile surface and this worked great. So if its tile you got go for it! But if not beware it might not stick.
4,Huge,"This thing is huge. I bought it because the recommended item was for the shower mirror. Do NOT use it for the Shave well shower mirror, it would not even fit on the hook. I've found some other use for it. It's very strong though."
1,Not even close!,"My young boy does not connect with this DVD at all. I have played it repeatedly, but to no avail. Baby Mozart is a much better product. The DVD claims to be country, but I fail to find anything country about it. The arrangements of the songs is nothing new."
1,Terrible Disappointment,"My daughter purchased this on my suggestion. I have seldom been so extremely disappointed in a product. It's a ""couldn't make it"" for any kiddy show on a cartoon network. There's nothing ""country"" about it unless you're so urbanized that ""Old McDonald"" turns you on."
2,Just click on the television!,"With the ever-growing video collection that my baby is amassing, I regret to say that ""Country Baby"" will all too quickly fade into the ""seldom watched"" category. She crawls off and comes back to it but NEVER registers the excitement and level of interest that she does just watching Nickelodeon. Despite seemingly good intentions, this product is not worth the purchase. Just click on the television!"
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful!","This video is so awful that I am going to sell mine and try to recoup my money. Stay away. Stick to Baby Einstein. Believe me, you'll be glad that you did."
2,Cocktail pianist at best and no jazz vocalist,"Because Ms Krall is accompanied by some outstanding musicians of the jazz genre I presume she is concerned to be recognized as a jazz singer and a jazz pianist. If this is so then I have to say her nasal twang, indifferent rhythmic sense, and poor understanding of the lyric makes her an indifferent jazz interpreter of the great american song book. To take ""I've Got the World On A String"" as an example, it may as well be sung by a computer. Embarrassing. As for her piano playing then she is an accomplished cocktail pianist but to place her in the jazz pantheon would be a considerable leap of pure faith.On the slower tunes, she is more successful in a cutesy way as on ""Squeeze Me"". But I would think she must be the most overrated ""jazz"" artist of the last decade."
4,Nice Coin!,The coin is clean and protected. The limited edition # is faded so make sure you ask the seller for a CLEAR numbered coin. This is a MUST for ALL RAMS FANS!!
5,Horror punk lives on!,"I have always been a misfits fan, with Danzig and Graves, and most of the new horror punk bands either aren't very original or just didn't have the sound that catches your attention. The Other are probably one of the best new horror punk bands out right now. I am a little surprised that not many people have heard of them. Over all it is an excellent album, you can hear some similarities with the misfits, but they still have an original sound. They have samples of their songs on Myspace! If you like the misfits, you can't go wrong with The Other!"
4,Great Little Book,"This is a terrific introduction to the city, easy to read and digest. It is not detailed like a DK Eyewitness Travel Guide, but it has the essentials, including some phrases, maps, and web site references."
4,Very good DBA Pocket reference,"I've found this book very good for daily tasks starting right from installation and configuration, addressing the management tasks and backup and recovery steps. This books is a quick reference for many of the problems. It does not specifically addresses the performance tuning issues. I think it is a book every Oracle DBA should have for reference."
2,A great transfer doesnt save this ship from sinking into boredom,"Hazel Court and Dermot Walsh star as a couple who buy a ship to live on - it turns out that it is haunted ..or is it ? I wont spoiler the ending, but it is really dull throughout the movie. A little too talky and a little too many 'comical' scenes for a ghost movie. It really lacked a strong horror presence if that is what the movie was intended to beThe transfer is really fantastic, but a great transfer doesn't make a great film. It can only be a clear picture while you are watching this slow paced lackluster movie.See Ghost Ship by Val Lewton instead..."
3,Ghost Ship,"I was looking for an old movie where the boat/ship in question is found abandoned at sea and the is a mist or fog and there are people covered in a type of seaweed looking moss that haunt the ship however this was not it, but this the one however not a bad movie for an oldie."
5,Greatest low budget investment you can make...,"This is a great game at any price. The game-play is fast and easy to learn, the graphics are good, and the sound is great. Plus, you get to immerse yourself in a retro world of muscle cars, bell-bottoms, and disco funk. I have played this game hundreds of times and never get tired of it. Do yourself a favor and buy the original, too."
5,For the Franciscan Apple Collector!,"Just when I think I own every piece of Franciscan Apple Cookware, China, Glasses, Stemware, Linens, and Specialty Items (like my Wall Clock), I am so pleased to find another piece. Franciscan China has been manufactured for a long time--about 15 years ago, Wedgwood China in England purchased the California Franciscan line. This Franciscan Casserole Dinnerware with Lid is perfect for use, as oven-to-tableware. However, I tend to use all my Franciscan Apple Casseroles as serving dishes for precooked food. I heat the dish in a 225-250 degree oven so that it is warm for serving. If you use this Dinnerware for baking in the oven be careful not to set the temperature too high. If you are not familiar with this pattern of dinnerware, you will be charmed by the handpainted apple design. Each piece is unique!"
3,Well played; badly encoded,"This recording has a lot going for it; it's a fantastic performance. Unfortunately, the MP3 version exhibits some unfortunate and irritating audio artifacts, especially when the vaunted CSO brass plays particularly high or fortissimo. The problems are apparent right from the beginning in the trumpet entrance. I can't say if the CD recording has the same trouble, but my guess based on the other reviews is that this problem results from the conversion to MP3."
4,Good Profile,McCoy does a great job putting Robert Parker in context and illuminating how he has changed the world of wine and how in some respects he is needed while showing how he is harmful in others.The narrative is smooth and precise.Solid Read.
3,Worth the read,"An easy and mildly entertaining read. This is a book worth reading, but with the occasional typo (I know it happens), some strange choice of words at times, and constant references and name dropping on the part of the author it bothered me a bit at times. I have never read a biography that contained so many stories, opinions and personal information about the author. Ok, I get it. You are an important and successful individual, had I cared I would of bought the Elin McCoy Autobiography. I don't, so I didn't. The author and her subject also appear to be quite familiar with each other, and have known each other for over thirty years, I believe this has lead to a rather glossy image at times. If it weren't for these small items I would have given 4 stars instead of three. Cheers"
5,The Book for those intrested in the changing worldwide attitude towards wine,"This book explains how Robert Parker has materially changed demand, tastes and marketing of wines worldwide. One can agree or disagree with Parker's particular tastes but as Elin MCoy well explains his influence has been dramatic. Many traditionalist violently disagree with Parker (see New York Times Book review) but they are limited to ad hominem attacks when they try to belittle his effect on the trade. A most important book."
4,great overview of how a lawyer became a wine king,"Good overview describing how robert parker became robert parker. No big nuggets, but well written and good insights and background since parker clearly cooperated with the writer, who is a wine critic in her own right and thus understands the business. Informative and a good story while also telling you how the wine industry works and how it evolved from the days of Almaden to today."
3,Thats a lot of wine,Parker has almost made me a beleiver. But why does it take 100 points to tell him if it tastes good or not. I can do it in 20.
3,Nice summer reading,Nice but a bit long and not specific enough like what did the team PArker& Rolland bring etc
5,wine world,good book- easy read -not much wine information but a lot of data on other wine writers. reads like fiction- easy to pick up and put down.
4,IT IS AWESOME,This is the most helpful book I have ever had. It is a resource center that I have needed for some time. I reccomend it to anyone with an interest in world war II.
1,Lousy Monitor!,"This is one lousy monitor. First off the VGA connection doesn't work with my Mac Mini. The DVI connection does, the problem with having the DVI connection is that the monitor blacks out and then comes right back. I did some research on the internet and much to my dismay this is the case with all Acer monitors, it is a glitch that can't be fixed and Acer refuses to acknowledge the problem. I contacted customer service and was given the runaround for almost 45 minutes before giving up. I can't even return it to Amazon because I can't get the stand unhooked. The other reviews must be from people who work for the Acer corporation. I feel like I have been ripped off."
2,Selfish Fairy Tale,It's a tragic story but very misleading. Jean (the mother) has given up her life for her daughter. How many people would or should do that ? How selfish to go far away to Harvard instead of a local school in these circumstances. Her mother deserves to live a life too. Her brother and sister deserve their mother around. Her father deserves his wife around.As for getting money from the book and the movie - good for them ! They need every cent. Maybe now they can start the sequel and this time show the world how it really is for most of these patients. Maybe even bring up the importance of stem cell research. The only difference between us and Brooke is two seconds of bad luck.
1,not sure about this one,"I just saw the movie that was based on this book last night. If the book is anything like the movie, I wouldn't buy it.ETA: Contrary to ""popular belief"", her life was hardly inspirational. I find it ""uninspirational"" to take advantage of being hit by a car, something that IS totally preventable."
4,The Logo is a little small,"I purchased one for my 2,5 years old boy and one for me....the only complain I have of this T-shirt is that the logo is a little small, but it is a good election. We boht wear the T-shirts in a day of vacation trip in Venezuela, in every airport a lot of people came to me and made me commentaries about Guns and Roses and about the way my son and me look with the same T-shirts (like a rock n'roll uniform). I am very happy whit this item"
2,Not quite.....,"The open version of this product is nowhere near as good as the closed version. Perhaps the 8"" is just too small. The jaws are not very wide and clamping it onto a bolt or nut takes a lot of finesse."
5,grippers,these are great for most jobs. there are some places that they won't work but for the most part they are wonderful
5,Loggerhead Bionic Wrench Made in America.....I have both the closed and open style. Thanks for a great product.,Bionic Grip wrench.....This is a great tool....It is well made and heavy duty....It enables me to get great pressure on stubborn bolts.....especially with painful finger joints
5,Perfect!,"They do what they are supposed to do. Just connect one end to the SAS card and the other 4 plugs to each SAS / SATA hard drives. Perfect fit, no problem after 3 months of use.They worked perfect and are really cheap to buy."
5,Terrific media,"These discs burn without fail every time. Greatest, high quality bang for the buck going. Can't be more happy that Amazon offers them."
4,"so far, so good",I have used about a quarter of the spindle so far and not a bad one in the bunch. Of course even if I ran across a bad one or so I would still make a good recommendation to purchase this product. I am pleased and would buy it again.
1,"Poor quality, poor customer support, poor buy","Bought a cake box of these and as some have listed this is CMC MAG AM3 media a low quality manufacturer. The edges of the ink on the disk are irregular and highly pitted. These disks are usable, but only if you burn a smaller size than full. If you use at 4gb than they may work. I had a failure rate of better than 65%. This is with a clean windows install, updated dvd firmware and fully patched burning software. I have a high level of tech knowledge (so don't blame my coasters on that.) When I contacted TDK for help they wanted me to use the full package and then send back only the bad ones. When I mentioned the pitted edges they started asking me to email pics. Why should I do their quality control. I'm just going to throw them out and never buy TDK again, I suggest you do the same.If your a previous user of TDK understand that they sold off their media rights to Imation, this is not the same quality media your used to using."
5,Work Great,"These have been working great in my stand-alone dvd recorder. While I've always favored Maxell, Amazon does not offer them, and these seem to be as good or better. Amazon's packaging leaves something to be desired, but damage was limited to one scratched up disc. Price is 21c each !!!"
1,Do not buy this,This is a very bad product. About 50% of the dvds that I tried to burn had errors. And I tried 2 burners .... LiteON on my desktop and whatever burner is there in a macbook
1,Not as Advertized!,The discs pictured are manufactured in Taiwan and are of fairly good quality. The ones you receive are poor quality Indian junk in a black package. Check any label carefully before opening any package! Ones made in Malaysia are also usually junk. I phoned Amazon and was assured I would receive the right discs if I returned what I had and reordered. I got the wrong ones again! This is my first such experience with Amazon. It appears they may have quit caring about quality and honesty.
2,no luck with these,"I would recommend that you stay away from this product and try something else. I was taken by the the great price and brand name. But after getting about 25-30 good burns, I ended up throwing the rest away because my DVD burner would not recognize them (intel mac mini superdrive). Thinking it was a faulty drive and not the media. I recorded the last two episodes of the Sopranos on my Panasonic DVD recorder using one of these things. Sure enough, after canceling HBO, the media could not be read by the recorder. I think I will try smaller quantities until I find a solid brand that works for me."
3,OK most of the time... but then again...,"I am on my 4th 100 Pk of these DVD -Rs. I only use them for full length movies and all have burned OK... but not without glitches during playback, and those seem to come from the same spindle of blanks. The first 100 worked fine. When I started on the 2nd 100 I would get pops and skips during playback. I tried the same disc in multiple players and the problem was still there, however not always as severe as in a different player. I've had similar results with the 3rd and 4th spindles. Overall I would say 80% of the movies have been OK. My faith in TDK is gone and for peace of mind's sake I think my next purchase will be Taiyo-Yuden. I hear nothing but good about them."
5,great product,i was worried that because the product was so cheap it would be less in quality.not the case. they work great and i have no complaints
1,"discs burn BUT don't maitain memory, lost much time due to these.","I thought buying TDK would be good, I only had a few bad discs that would not burn. The ones that did burn (100% of them) would play good a few times, then would not play anymore, my dvd players would not recognize them. I do have quality dvd players (Yamaha, Sony and Eclipse) and they play all my other DVDs just fine."
1,yup they suck,"i have a sony, 2 nec, and 1 pioneer burner in my home.none of them burn consistently (e.g. 50 unfailed burns in a row) with this media.they always fail to close or some other problem occurs midstream of data write.very bad, won't ever buy again."
1,"TDK Branded, not made by TDK","These discs are not really TDK - they are low-quality discs branded and priced as TDK.I have a Samsung S182M DVD Burner and it will not recognize these discs at all. It just spins them around and around forever. The one time I got it to recognize one of these, it reported that it was Media ID Daxon0016s. Avoid these."
2,More coasters than useable DVD's,All TDK are not created equal. This particular version has not performed well for me at all. I have use the white printable dvd's and they were good. I find that the best are still Verbatim brand. That's all I am buying from now on. These are a waste of time and money.
3,Poor packing of product for shipping,Packing of the product for shipping was terrible. The plastic spindle containing the DVD-Rs arrived cracked and could not be salvaged. Had to transfer all the DVD-Rs to an old spindle that I had on hand. Called their customer serivice and said they said they will credit $5 for the inconvenience and this is the only reason why I gave it 3 stars and not 2 stars.
1,not 4.7 gb,"these disks are not 4.7gb there actually 4.4 or 4,489 mb,plus they dont come out right half of the time.im always having some sort of problem or error when trying to burn one.i would not recomend this brand,go with a good brand like sony or something"
1,Horrible Condition,"Item was listed as new but previously opened and taped shut. Upon opening it I found that the discs where dusty, scratched and some were flipped upside down."
1,Amazon doesn't know how to pack this item,I have no complaint with the actual item. The discs are reliable and write and read totally fine in my experience.But Amazon fails in the way they pack this for shipment. They just throw the heavy spindle in a box with a couple of air bags. Mine arrived with the spindle part completely broken from the base and all the DVD-Rs loose in the container. Luckily the discs seem okay and I had an old intact container to transfer them to. But I was not at all happy with the insufficient way that Amazon packed these. Watch out for this.
2,TDK 16X Dual-Layer DVD Disks,"I bought these without my usual careful attention to detail. They burn reliably and fine, but why anyone would make or sell DVD blanks at this late date that you CAN'T PRINT ON (i.e., they have the stupid old unprintable shiney top surfaces) ~ is beyond me. I now use them for test disks only, since every project I do must have on-disk printed labeling. Caveat emptor ~ look like a hawk for the innocuous word ""PRINTABLE"" in addition to all the other geek-descriptive words. And NATURALLY, since I opened the shrink wrap to burn my first DVD, I can't return this huge pile of coasters."
4,Large box,"Well item arrived in a box 15""x13""x8"". Which is rather large for such a small item. Also the product was damaged somewhat just the case none of the dvd's all the dvd's were ok. I am satified with it except for the huge box it came in. Haven't tested the dvd's yet but it should work."
1,TDK DVD -R Blanks have a very high failure rate,"I have used a whole range of DVD -R blanks, from brandless ones to the very high end. One of the worst is TDK. The failure rate is almost 50% and this is for my computer dvd burner and my DVD recorder. I use Nero Burning suite as well as Roxio and the results for TDK blanks are consistently bad. I have had very little failure with Maxell and Fuji. I am truely amazed that this product is being given 5 star ratings by some reviewers."
3,Will do in a pinch,"These are not the quality I was expecting. I've had several ""coasters"" and have had to slow my burning down to 8x. Even at 8x I've had a few coasters in my two Sony DVD burners. I've used over a thousand TY brand and had maybe 10 coaster in that many discs. I'll stick with T Y brand."
1,Avoid TDK DVD-R discs,"I have used various brands of DVD media without a problem until I bought a 50-pack TDK DVD spindle. My DVD recorder is unable to record on TDK and rejects all my attempts. I pop in a Sony disc and it works perfectly. The TDK company isn't very responsive either,TDK 16X DVD+R 50 Pack Spindlesuggesting only that I ship the discs to them at my expense for their examination. Do not buy this product."
2,didnt work,"all they did for me was to make coasters, i could not burn any movies to them, they might be good disc, but they would not work for me on my system, had to go to walmart and spend twice as much to get usable disc"
1,Indeed! This batch seems to have a quality downgrade,"After a series read-ups on the web, I would second T. Lum's review (written Aug 2006). I have always been impressed with TDK CD and DVD media. I have previously owned at least 3 25-pack DVD 8x and 16x spindle and only had 2-5 burn failures due to my mistakes. Naturally when I ran out of them, I got more due to good experiences with them. With these 2 100pack spindle that I recently purchase, for some odd reason, my TDK 1616N writer (with latest firmware) was not able to find the max-speed of the disc. I perform a diskinfo check on it and on a disc from the previous (good) batch, indeed the difference in the manufacture ID is CMC MAG. AM3 (crap) vs TTG02 (good). This may be worth to take note of when considering buying this."
1,Excellent product packed by an idiot,"This is the best blank DVDR available. Unfortunately, if you buy it from Amazon, expect it to arrive with the spindle broken because the only packing was a tiny piece of bubble in the box. There was nothing to keep it from flopping around in the box. Luckily, I had an old empty spindle to transfer the blanks to. Sigh, I guess idiots have to work somewhere. Glad it's not NASA."
1,Unusable on NEC DVD Burner,"There is a vast array of DVD burners and writable DVD media, in terms of companies. These TDK DVD-R disks seem to be entirely incompatible with a NEC ND-3550A DVD burner. Rather than throw them away, which I should do, I think I may just keep them on the side until lite-on makes a blueray burner (with DVD burning capabilities) in a reasonable price range. I've been looking for a blueray burner, hopefully it will be able to handle these disks."
5,"Great DVD-R's, Great Brand","I have finished more than three-quarter of the 100-pack spindle and I have yet to find a coaster. The thing with DVD's or CD's is that when you find a bad one, it seems to be bunched into the same stack as they were manufactured at the same place and at the same time. My recommendation is not to burn DVDs or CDs using the maximum speed, the chance of a bad burn tend to be much much less if you knock it down a bit. Same as filling up the data capacity, 4200mb seems to work best for me as filling up the DVD to the edge may become problematic."
3,Many Defective Discs,"Maybe it's the discs, maybe it's my DVD recorder, but about one out of ten of the TDK DVD-R discs ended up with a message ""disc error"" or ""unknown disc"" It's not so much the loss of a disc as the two hours it takes to record a movie, just to end up having to record it all over again."
5,I don't understand why others have so many problems,"I have been burning DVDs for several years now, totaling over 2500 discs. I have used several different machines; at present I use a Magnavox that I paid $50 for at Wal-Mart. As for the discs, I usually buy whatever is the lowest price. The last 200 I bought were TDKs from Amazon. I paid only $21/100.It may be hard to believe after reading many of the other reviews here, but my experience has been almost problem free. I doubt if I have lost more than 10 discs in all that time, and most of the failures were my fault. Why others have so many problems and complaints, I do not know and will not even speculate.Maybe it's just good luck, but whatever the reason, I wish everyone else had the same experience I have had!"
5,TDK 4.7GB 16x DVD-R (100-Pack Spindle),"I've purchased 3 of these 100 packs from Amazon (ordering another now) and I've only had 2 ""bad burn"" coasters out of 300 disk burns using 4 different DVD burners, 2 in computers and 2 being used to burn/record TV shows. I highly recommend these disks."
2,So many returns!!!,"After using many different brands, hence, OFFICE DEPOT, JVC, LG, FUJI, MEMOREX, I came across onto TDK. With this brand I would successfully copy DVDs and ship it out to our customers in North, Central, and South America. All of a sudden we started to receive a shower amount of returns stating that it freezes a lot. When I reviewed one of them, to my surprise I found it to be true. I have used over 1000 TDK discs, some were successful with no freezes, but also I have the bad ones to wonder about. I started to purchase SONY media and I came across with no fuss and our customers haven't returned any of them. I still have a few spindles of TDK, but I only use them for data archiving. I give it two stars cause some TDK discs were ok, however, now I have to replace the bad ones, and Lord knows how many I have to replace."
1,TDK DVD-R 100pk spindle useless,"I bought this TDK DVD-r 100 pack to burn home and school projects etc. Tried 12 of them, none worked. Tried it on three different computer. every other brand of DVD-R working fine. TDK is a piece of c... I am sorry!"
2,not for LG DVD/VCR combo recorder,"Unreliable results recording with LG DVD-R/VCR combo LRY-517. About half of TDK discs recorded on LG combo have serious skipping or jumping problems, or just stall in playback. The same LG recorder works 100% with JVC, Imation, HP, Fujifilm or Sony DVD-R discs. On the other hand, so far the TDKs seem to be working fine for computer burned data discs."
1,Low quality,I didn't heed the warnings on the previous reviews and bought these DVDs anyway. The bad reviews were unfortunately accurate and these discs refuse to work in my NEC burner and only operate at 2x in my Powerbook's superdrive.Spend a little extra and get a better brand.
3,Didn't work on my NEC DVDRW,"My NEC drive wouldn't recognize these DVDs, however they were fine in my Plextor drive"
1,A RETURN TO SENDER PAIN IN THE BUTT!,"Had to send the whole lot of them back because they would not record. It's not the first time this happened with these, either. I miss the quality products of the ""good old days."" Seems like almost anything you buy anymore is a roll of the dice if it will work or not!"
2,Tons of defectives,"I bought this just to back up the data I have on my two external HDs (500 + 400 gig), and I've ran through about 30 burns today. Unfortunately about 8-9 of those have not finalized or have just failed, a porous rate. Avoid if you can."
3,"Good compatibility, but only really 12X","Burns well, is compatible with DVD-player for movies, but my Nero Express software identifies it as 12X media instead of the advertised 16X."
5,Nice and Worth,"Although the DVD case was broken when I received it, the DVD-R discs are running well during burning process."
5,Cheaper than Local Stores,"Not only did I get this in 3 days after ordering, I had value-shopped at my local Staples and Office Depot. Both had the same product priced $15 higher for each. So, yes, I am very pleased with my purchase...and shipping."
1,Entire spindle is NO Good - Unuseable,"Bought these on 7-18-09. I didn't need them until 11-20-09. They have been stored indoors in a cabinet below my tv.I had trouble burning a few and thought it was my burner. NOT SO !! So far, 10 of 10 have been no good. Tried a new burner and same thing. I bought a spindle of HP dvd's and so far, 10 for 10 have burned successfully. I have used TDK's for years because they were so reliable. This spindle is 100% rotten - no good - trash, can't even use them as frisbees.I want my money back................ PLEASE!!"
1,"""knock off""","I dont even think they are made by TDK, They will not register on any dvd burning program at more that 4x speed only. And on most programs not being able to change the speed to 16x it screws up the writing. The disc states 1 to 16x writing speed and I have tried 15 different programs and I cant get these disks to write faster than 4. I finally found a program ""image burn that will write at 4x and not screw up the writing. Using Nero it will leave gaps at the end of the writing, and it is irretating to watch 2 to 4 minutes of skipping. The price might be cheap but you get what you pay for, like I said I think they are knock offs, on image burn it shows the manufacturer of the disc on details when recording and on this disc it comes up bsdk24 ot some like that, not tdk. When I put a sony disk in it says sony."
1,no so hot,i opened the box and found the case was cracked and the discs didnt work on my burner. I have used tdk dvdrs before so i dont know why it didnt work. i returned it.
3,Shipping Issues,I like these DVDs ordered but the last few shipments have arrived with cracked cases. Fortunately the DVDs weren't scratched. The packaging needs to be better for items this heavy.
5,One of the best transactions I have had.,"The TDK Electronics 4.7GB/16x DVD-R (100-Pack Spindle) is awesome, I've burned over 50 disk already and not one error, problem, or bad disk yet! I strongly recommend this product and further more J&R Music and Computer World a company to use in the future."
5,Reliable product,These DVDs are affordably priced and reliable. I have had to discard very few so far for burn malfunctions.
2,tdk 4.7gb spindle (100),"This was never a completed purchase. In the end, I never received an unbroken product. In each shipment, the article was poorly packaged and thus sustained shipment damage. I ended up getting a refund instead of the intended product!"
1,Discs Won't Burn,"I've been burning DVD's for over 2 years now and never had a problem. I generally buy the cheapest DVDs I can find, which led me to the TDK product. I tried burning four separate TDK discs with no luck. I inserted a Verbatim and it burned the exact file without a problem. I've now sent the whole lot back to Amazon."
2,Who wrapped this product?,"When I got the TDK 100-pack of DVDs, it was falling apart and DVDs were sliding out of the bottom of the container."
1,Store bought great packed well but not from this seller -comes wtih aftermarket/repacked,"The seller sent what appears aftermarket generic packaging. Seller gives picture of what a store would sell you, but you do not get that item as pictured.No customer service till Amazon got involved.You might say when you buy from J and R that you might be buying a ""cat in the bag""."
4,TDK DVD's compatibility,I have tried many different brands of DVD's looking for the one that is most compatible with my family members DVD players. Some would play and others would not. TDK DVD-R has shown to be the only DVD media that has successfully played in all of their DVD players both old and new models. They work for me and I'm staying with them.
5,Great Disks!,Work as advertised. I bought 150 of these and had zero failures. I would reccomend these disks. A shame that they are not sold as prime elgible any longer.
1,What happened to TDK?!,"I have been buying TDK discs - cd and dvd - for years without hardly any trouble at all. I could always trust them. The last two batches of 100 packs I have bought though have been increasingly unreliable. Out of the latest pack, I have gotten 7 discs to burn properly out of 22 discs. That is completely and totally unacceptable. You're losing me TDK. Now what do I buy?"
2,Low quality media,"The grey top DVD-R media sold by TDK is manufactured by CMC magnetics (CMCMAG.AM3). The media quality is moderate to poor. It seems to burn fine at 8x but produces a lot of coasters at 12x and 16x. Some DVD players seem to have trouble reading the data. Really bad stuff coming from TDK. For better burn quality, buy Verbatim or Sony media."
4,One Opinion,Have burned several hundred DVD's with this product and see no great difference between it and higher priced brands. Averages 1 or 2 bad discs per 100. Fine for data or audio use but have experienced problems with video as many older (2 years or more) DVD players do not handle 16X very well. Overall a good buy for the price.
1,Just plain bad!!!,"Out of the first 10 that I've used, of this 100 pack, I've gotten 3 dud's. IMO thats already to many. Now I just have to waste my time with about 90 more of these disks from hell. Friggin great :("
1,Spend it on another brand,"It's the first time I've bough TDK DVDs and I am having a horrible experience with them. The DVDs are not compatible with my Dell 700m with a NEC HD-6650A DVD+/-RW drive. It keeps saying illegal disc. This did not happen with the HP 16x DVD-R or the Memorex 16x DVD-R I used previous to running out and buying these TDK DVD-Rs. On my desktop Liteon drive (apparently there's less problems with a desktop burner), it worked 1 out of 10 times. So at this rate, I'll probably get 10 good DVDs out of the 100 I bought. I do not recommend this product at all."
4,Good!,These discs seem to hold up a lot better than most brands for those who use them over and over again.
5,Great Blanks,"I used all 100 of these and are now buying the same ones again. Burned 99 without a problem. 1 coaster. When I noticed it had an error message using nero, I looked at the disk and it was bad manufacturing by TDK. The disc has some uneven markings at the outter part. I'm giving it 5 stars instead of 4 because 99 out of 100 is pretty good for my standards."
2,so many coasters...,"The 16X TDK-R I bought a few months ago was really bad. I tried burning on different dvd writers, but the results were the same...at least 4 coasters out of every 10 discs. The 8X TDK were perfect, but it's hard to find them anywhere. So I'm using verbatim now."
4,DONT GET RIPPED OFF,OH MY GOD I CAN NOT BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE ARE CHARGING THIS MUCH. TOYS R US HAS THESE STOCKED AND SELLS THEM FOR $10 !!!!!! PLEASE DONT GET RIPPED OFF.
2,Great Music - Ugly Sets,"Peter Sellar's staging of Mozart's Zaide has got to be one of the ugliest stagings I have ever seen. I have seen amateur productions with better sets and costumes. You are better off buying an audio version of this opera than buying this video.On the other hand, Mozart's music is sublime."
3,These blades are OK.,"These little blades are ok. I had purchased these along with the carbide blade set. We generally cut plywood 3/4"" and thicker. I would imagine that these blades will work well on thinner plywood, but on the the thicker material they do not leave as smooth of a finish as the carbide blades. They would probably be excellent on drywall material."
1,THIS IS JACK IN THE BOX MUSIC AT IT'S BEST!,"I FIND IT ACTUALLY AMUSING THAT ANYONE COULD PUT THIS GARBAGE IN THE SAME ARENA WITH AN ARTIST SUCH AS JEAN LUC PONTY. THE WORLD FOR SOME MUST BE COMING TO A CLOSE. THIS PARTICULAR WORK LACKS CREATIVITY AND CERTAINLY WILL LEAVE AN ADVID LISTENER OF JAZZ DISGRUNTLED, ESPECIALLY IF THEY PAY FOR IT. CATCH IT ON A FREEBIE LIST AND GIVE IT TO AN ENEMY."
4,Shades of Noel Pointer!!,"Very smooth and easy CD I purchased in 1995. Listening to it, I can't help but remember listening to tunes of the late Noel Pointer from the late 70's/early 80's. I love his rendition of ""Summer Madness"" and the soothing ""Peace of Mind"". Very good CD."
4,Very good,"Well, I agree with the previous reviewer that her voice is certainly not at its peak in this DVD. However considering her age she sounds fabulous!"
3,The Farewell CD,"This is probably Dame Kiri's last major release CD, and if it isn't it should be. As demonstrated on this CD her voice is now tired and unemotive. Her radiant tone is now wobbily and unsteady, and she sounds over-miked and uninvolved. It was wise that she had the back-up of several other singers, younger and in more vocal prime, on her programme.Dame Kiri has announced her retirement from staged opera (www.kiritekanawa.org). Like all great singers before her, there does come a time when ones powers are waning and you must stop. I think this CD is sad, a reminder of what things once were but are no longer."
2,fat joe and ashanti???,okay this is a okay cut if you like this sort of thing another song written by ja rule not a big ja rule but he would have sounded better doing this than joe would.
4,bib,color is great. Shipping time was a little long. I am happy with the product and it is a wipe clean bib which is a great thing.
5,Amazing,I had to read this book for a class. I am glad that I did since it has been an amazing book. Great stories and a real easy read to help you understand the ways of being a leader.
4,"Very good, particularly for a newb to game","Compared to most strategy guides, which are usually just re-hashes of material in the manual, this guide is chock full of strategies and interesting info about a very deep game. Some of the strategies will be obvious to seasoned vets, but for newcomers they'll be a great help.There are more than 200 pages, most in very small print meaning the author has crammed a lot of material in. There are errors here and there, probably a result of the book being written before the game was 100% complete. But all in all a good effort."
4,The Usual Good Fun from Agatha Christie,"This book is good for a quick jump into the realm of good murder mysteries. The stories can be read in 15 to 25 minutes, for those of us without enough time to fully appreciate a full length novel. They are however engaging, fun, and nicely thought out. The title story (The Under Dog) is the longest and in my mind the best, as Mrs. Christie had more pages for charater development and story twists. Our favorite detective, Hercule Poirot is featured in all of the stories with multiple appearances of Captain Hastings. Each story had me wondering until the last page. Definately recomended as a before bed reading."
4,Good book,"The book was outstanding and I enjoyed the topics covered and the simplicity. There were typos here and there that should be ignored.I higly recommend this book. Make sure you start with ""Beginning Oracle"" before delving into this one."
5,Tom speaks - Oracle Community listens,"Atleast I have around 25 oracle books. I cherish the ones written by authors like Steve Adams, Jonathan lewis, Gaja Vaidyanatha. But this man ( sorry, Oracle God) Tom Kyte stands very tall even in elite company. I have read and re-read and re-read this book. It is information packed in every sentence. THE BEST ORACLE BOOK PRODUCED TILL DATE. PERIOD..."
5,Absolutely love this book!,"As a 6 year Oracle DBA I couldn't keep myself away from this thick book. I purchased it just 4 days ago, and have already found MANY valuable tips and code that I can apply to improve my work immediately. While reading it late at night for the last few nights, I was wondering about other ""goodies"" books from the same author Tom Kyte and wanted to get all of them.Buy it."
5,Finally an Oracle book worth the price!!!,"This book is the only Oracle book that is worth the money. The author's knowledge about Oracle and his willingness to share it are shown on each and every page! It's not a dedicated Oracle DBA book but a real DBA should have it. And really, Larry Ellison should triple his salary:)"
5,In a class of its own..!,"Tom Kyte is a rarest of the rare breeds. He not only enjoyed architecting the solution but also articulated the same with contagious enthusiasm. The book leaves you with a sense of invincibility, which might be construed as a negative factor only if you are an incurable pessimist. I won't go as far as saying this is THE book and only book you will need for oracle, but this came pretty close to it...!In short one of the great books to come out on the subject of ORACLE."
3,For beginners,"this book may be all that is said to be by the other evaluators, however if you consider yourself an experienced oracle user/dba there are better books you can spent your money on."
5,Excellent Oracle Book,"The Expert One-On-One is the best Oracle book that I purchased.It really tell you lots of Oracle detail.Even the author said the book is for Oracle developer, it is a very good book to DBA as well.However, this book has some typing error. If the auditor can correct thos errors, this book will be perfect."
3,Meh.,"I thought the item was pretty cool at one point, but then I couldn't stand that belt clip piece that kept poking my leg in my pocket. If you use the belt clip part of it, then it's nice. Otherwise, it's a pain."
5,Great!,"Good price, great colors, super fast arrival, seems like I have more than enough! I would try different colors next time."
4,Wonderful Christmas Love Story,"I enjoyed this book very much. When I bought it I had planned to put it in my to read pile, which is quite large. Something about it caught my attention - a promise to meet every year on Christmas Eve! Christmas Eve --- what a special day. I remember being young and naive and being able to forgive the one I loved anything if he would return the love I gave him. I had to read this book and enjoyed the story so very much. I laughed and smiled and cried. This one will have a spot on my keeper shelf - after I read it again."
1,very disatisfied!,I can not say anything about the product. Never got it. After more then two weeks and it had not shipped i canceled my order. I guess they don't need my business. I am in a German shepherd club and we all are shepherd fans. We all were going to order . But oh well we will find another company. Thanks for nothing!
3,You are Not Alone,"Single Parent Support is a collection of scriptures that were carefully chosen to empower and challenge the single parent. The scriptures represented are meant to arm a single parent with a biblical support system. The last few pages of the book are presented in journal form. These pages are to be utilized by the reader to prepare a family mission statement, prayer and goals.I feel the book could have been enhanced with the addition of short meditative moments.

3,Required text,"This is a required text for a class I am taking. It is pretty outdated, but the foundation knowledge is good for someone that can apply the thoughts behind it to current technology."
2,Copyright 2003--This book is ancient!,"Amazingly enough this book still has some value--human processes don't change that much. Their incident response examples seem charmingly innocent--like being called to assist a company with a single exchange server or setting a threshold of 5 affected machines. But,unless you're just nostalgic you probably want to stay away.How big a machine do you need to run your tools on? Their specification for a forensics workstation calls for a ""High end processor"" with ""A minimum of 256MB of RAM"". (Yes, that's *megabytes* and I'm sure it was a screamer in its day.) And they keep talking about these things called ""floppies""... Furthermore, I'm pretty sure their 7 year old tools are going to be pretty hit or miss in terms of their value and I'm guessing that the 7 year old links to web resources are going to be a little spotty.Memo to self--check copyright dates next time."
2,"Once good, and still is, but getting too old.","This book is in my opinion good.But it's written at a time when the new hot stuff was Windows 2000 and 200Gig drives the largest you could get.So the links to many of the web pages are frequently not relevant any more, and there exist newer tools that the book don't mention. So you have to update yourself using google and wikipedia with regards to the links and tools.But I assume and think that the methodology and the things to be aware of and check are still relevant to a 80 to 90 % degree.And I haven't found a better book (more up to date).This book would have received 4.5 stars from me if it had been up to date. But it's not, and in this area such a book need to be updated once a year.I do recommend the book though."
2,mediocre,"The book gives a decent overview on the field, but lacks technical accuracy. The authors fumble on technical details. For example, the authors botched the explanation of what happens when a unix file is deleted by claiming that all files with a link count of zero will be deleted. They also make the claim that only the SCSI interface will accommodate the multiple simultaneous communication that RAID requires - when really IDE will do this as well given proper firmware. Another gross oversight was the exclusion of reverse engineering in their investigation of rogue files chapter.When emailing the authors about this, all three ignored the email. I do not recommend supporting authors that ignore their readers."

5,Another good product from the Foundstone people,"I got an advanced copy of this book and I must say that it was not dissappointing. After reading hacking exposed, I expected usefull material from the Foundstone people and they have really come through with this book. There aren't that many good IR books out there. This has set a good standard.Like the Hacking Exposed book, you need to sit down at a computer when reading IR. With any technical book, the real values comes with using the tools and techniques that the book describes at the computer and learning the ins and outs.I wonder if they have the second addition already in the works?"
5,Female helicopter pilot and ski lodge owner--Fun romance!,She flies a helicopter and hopes to start a new quiet life inwilderness type surroundings. He runs a hard employer attitudeor does he? Opposites do attract. Great characters!
1,Good grief!,"This allegedly factual book is almost as far out as the science fiction novel ""Newton's Cannon: Book One in the Age of Unreason"", which is actually pretty good fiction. ""Newton's Cannon"" presents a fictional world in which Newton's thirty years of carefully investigating the claims of alchemy actually led him to discover the philosopher's stone and demonstrate the transmutation of metals, instead of laying the foundations of modern mechanical philosophy as he did in our world. ""The Cooling Continuum"" presents a similarly fictional world, in which Newton's (and Hooke's, to some extent) inverse-square law of gravitational attraction is not true. But ""The Cooling Continuum""--apparently in complete seriousness--puts forward the claim that the world it describes is actually the one we live in.In my opinion, Peter Bros is serving donuts on another planet, and quite possibly in a dimension orthogonal to ours.Good grief!"
4,"Liked the item, hated the assembly instructions.","A really nice solid bookcase with tons of space. It's beautiful and nicely made with plantation grown hard woods. On the other hand,the instructions to assemble it seem to have been drawn backwards. We had to assemble it three times to get it right way round but it was worth it."
1,Suspicious...,"I would never trust a 'new' ""Louis Vuitton"" selling for such a low price. Looks l ike a fake to me.... Do your research before buying..."
3,recipe for a perfect christmas,thought the mom was too pushy because of her insecurities.now that I have it don't know if i'll watch it more than one more time - then pass it on.
3,Natural and Warm,"Once in a while you see a film where the characters are more true to life, closer to the warts and all we all have and this is one like that - characters that we see and read about every day, ones we work with and live with or remember - makes for a fun watch."
2,Very Disappointed,"Bought this movie hoping to add a good 'watch again' Christmas movieto my collection. I ended up throwing it in the trash.The mom is a real jerk most of the movie, but finally becomes decentat the end. I do not consider this a good family movie. Content isquestionable for young children. The movie has some good parts, butthere are too many junk parts put in throughout. Too bad it wasn't allgood like the ending."
2,Not Recipe for perfect Christmas,"I was a little disappointed in my quest for a good Christmas flick. It is a typical Lifetime movie so I should have know better. Not much in it about Christmas just a relationship between daughter and mother who misunderstand each other until the truth comes out at the end. Not a bad film, just not my type."
5,Awesome Christmas Movie!,This is an awesome christmas movie. It shows the relationship between a mother and daughter. I think that Christine Baranski is awesome.
5,the erotic silence of the american wife,This book was life changing and challenging. It changed the way I live my life and the way I look at relationships. I am not pro-affairs but I can understand how men and women go outside of their marriages to find themselves. The analysis Heyn gives of our culture and what it means to be a wife and woman was mind blowing. Relationships can be more fullfilling and growth oriented if we start to value ourselves as much as our husbands and children- which is what the women did here through the act of infidelity which was a last resort to finding themselves.
1,Smith and Wesson Watches,"I purchased a Smith and Wesson Titanium Tactical gun metal gray watch in November 2005. The watch has been worn on special occasions probably not more than twenty times during those four-plus years. The watch is in mint condition and has kept excellent time until today when I observed it had stopped working. I took the watch to a jeweler for a battery and was informed that the watch did not need a battery but was in fact dead. As a further note I mention here that the tritium lights have also gone dim. I like tritium light watches and actually own three Luminox tritium watches purchased prior to the Smith and Wesson. The tritium in the three Luminox watches are as bright as when new and they all keep excellent time. The bottom line here is that I am very disappointed with the quality of the Smith and Wesson watch and would never purchase another, so buyers beware."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap!!","The quality of this doll is terrible. The hair is the cheapest possible hair for a play doll. It became matted and unbrushable within days. The shoes don't stay on and the skirt is held onto the doll by being sewn to the shirt by a tiny stitch. Once the stitch is removed the skirt will not stay on the doll at all. The tights are painted on and quickly scratched off. Also, the doll can be purchased at a national retail store for [...]. Please do not waste your money on this cheap doll."
1,Yuck!,"This doll looks NOTHING like Strawberry Shortcake. If your child is reading the books and watching the movies, they will not want to play with this doll. She is unrecognizable! If your child never watches any of the dvd's you might be able to pass it off. Huge disappointment. Playmates didn't get this one right at all."
2,great song - crap cd,I loved this song. It's got a great beat and really puts you in a good mood. But it's only on a single which [I don't like] cause singles are really pointless.
2,Almost completely useless book ...,Of course the experience of the authors is great but none of it you can use either in your study or research. It is impossible to learn about Kalman filtering from this book as well as to improve your knowledge in this area. Book is intended for professionals in this area but professionals will not need it. Many intersting facts but no detailed information. For example one can know that the square root filtering method came from James Potter but there is nothing more about this method from this book. Otherwise you have to study sources of the software (included). Book is written as advertizing of author's skills and nothing else. Too much about nothing ...
5,Best source of information on GPS,One of the students in my lecture came up to me and said he had studied this book all summer to learn about GPS. He found it to be very helpful to him and he said it was the best source of information on GPS he had come across.
4,Perfect for PC,"I'm a PC user and it works really great for me.I've been used it for year. I don't have any problem.There's one thing. Sometime it does work on Mac and sometime it doesn't. I don't really know the reason.Powerbook G4 12"" - work!Powerbook G4 15.4"" - no!G5 - work!I hope this helps you decide. :)"
2,"Liked it, wished it lasted more than 6 months beyond warranty","Bought it, liked the drive - clean, small deseign. Worked off one USB port on every computer (PC) I tried it on - never needed the second ""USB Power"" cable. Naturally would have liked it to have a larger capacity.The drive stopped working less than 6 months after the 1-year warranty. Doesn't look like there's a way to get the drive out without damaging the case.Talking to tech support now - glad I bought it w/ a credit card that extends the manufacturer's warranty."

1,Cute Junk,"Low resolution, slow shutter sppeds, slow downloads, and if the single AAA battery dies while you're shooting, you lose all your photos. Yes, it can be used as a webcam- but there are better webcams for that purpose.The problem with this puppy is that while it looks promising on paper, it just doesn't do anything very well. For not much more you can get a better camera with flash memory that won't vanish when the battery dies, or a web cam with much better resolution.I didn't pay anything for mine- I received it as a corporate thank-you gift- so I won't mind giving it away to a child who can play with it."
3,Not bad if...,"This camera will be a satisfying purchase to its buyers if their expectations aren't too great. Basically, it's small and neato-looking, and it takes fairly good pictures. But most of all it's small. I would give it a 5 if it were able to retain its memory (of taken photos) when the battery dies out. But because of this one major problem, 3 is all it's getting from me. I have one and it has a very limited, but very specific use for me. It does that just fine. My worry is people will buy this thing expecting just a bit more than with the SiPix can deliver."
3,Cute and Convenient,"I've had the Blink II for some time now. The quality is surprisingly good for a camera in this price range. Since it doesn't have a flash, optimal conditions would be outdoors or lots of lighting. Don't expect crystal-clear photos or even to be able to print your photos (I think the resolution is too low), but this camera provides a quick way to snap photos for posting on the internet or for email. This is a beginner's camera; if you want high quality, invest in a CCD megapixel camera. And it does go through batteries rather quickly; use an NIMH battery and download your pictures often to prevent data loss. If you're really paranoid about losing your pictures, I'd suggest looking at the Sipix Snap, which I hear has the ability to save picture information. On the plus side, it really is small and lightweight and will fit right in your pocket or purse."
3,A lot for a little,"I bought this so I'd always have a camera in my car, without worrying about the effect of heat and cold on conventional film.The SiPix Stylecam Blink II costs somewhat more than a disposable camera, but there are no processing costs, and it can be re-used. Plus, it is amazingly small.If you have one of the new cellphones that includes a camera, you likely won't need this too. But the Blink II also makes a fine good resolution Web cam.The Blink II is definitely worth its cost if you need either a Web cam or an extra camera for the car. On the other hand, its 640 X 480 resolution, fixed focus, and lack of either a flash or a lens cover are obvious limitations in serious photography."
3,Don't be lured by the size and price.,"Like many people who bought this camera, I was lured by its price and its compact size. So is it worth even this small amount? After months of owning it, I'd say no. The picture quality is low everywhere except for in the best outdoor lighting conditions. Also because the batteries die quickly, you are forced to download the pictures right away into your computer, which prevents you from traveling far with it.Even though it's not a huge amount of money, it's worth saving this amount for a better camera."
2,it works but i've used better,I got this from e-bay it was still in the box and had never been opened. I mostly got it for the webcam purpose but i used the camera to. it is hard to use because when you look though the hole at what you want to take a picture of you have to make sure to aim it up so that you actually get what you want. overall i like it but i'm going to get a different digital camera.
1,Cute Junk,"Low resolution, slow shutter speeds, slow downloads, and if the single AAA battery dies while you're shooting, you lose all your photos. Yes, it can be used as a webcam- but there are better webcams for that purpose.The problem with this puppy is that while it looks promising on paper, it just doesn't do anything very well.

1,WORTHLESS,"I ONLY OPENED THIS CAMERA TODAY SO I CAN'T RETURN. I LEARNED THAT ALL PICTURES LOST WHEN BATTERY RUNS DOWN SO MUCH IMMEDIATELY TRANSFER TO COMPUTER TO SAVE. ALSO, PROGRAM DID NOT WORK WHEN PUT IN COMPUTER FOR INSTALLATION, NO FLASH ATTACHMENT APPARENT SO ALL PICTURES OUTDOORS. SO BASICALLY I HAVE A PIECE OF JUNK-NOT WORTH BARGAIN PRICE. WISHED I HAD READ REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT."
4,"Small, okay quality","This camera is tiny, batteries easy to replace, camera is light and so on. u get the picture. So its easy to carry and it does not break easily. I've droped it many times and still works perfectly well. The quality is good, if u are really still and there is enough light. So about 1/4 of the pictures you take are going to be the best the camera can give you. another1/4 will be ok and the other 1/2 u can get rid of. the camera can store 80 pictures. When you get home you should download them and not wait a few days because the battery will run will run out. its worth buying, u can bring it anywhere. the software is the best. You can make cool slideshows and have albums. Really easy to use and install. This camera is definatly worth it."
1,stinks!!!,The camera worked fine for the first 3 days and then broke. it stopped working.I was dissapointed in it. It only takes 8 picures. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!
1,The most returned camera in the universe,"Another notorious online website (not this one) is offering 999 REFURBISHED SiPix II cameras for a few bucks, that means, at least 1000 costumers have returned these cameras to the manufacturer. Do you need to know more?"
1,really quite useless,"Two fudamental problems with this camera: poor image quality and flaky operation.I believe the poor image quality is due to the cheap fixed-focus lens. All my pictures come out blurry. It's not just resolution, because other cameras do a nice job at VGA resolution.The most frustrating problem is that this camera will often just lock-up, refusing to respond to buttons or to the PC. The only way to recover is to pull out the battery, thereby losing the stored pictures.Don't buy this model."
2,Just a toy.,"Make no mistake about it, this is a toy. It can take some low quality pictures that are suitable for some computer or emailing use, but nothing at all that can be printed and/or enlarged. It is pretty much as useful as any of the 1st generation picture-taking cell phones; in fact, the cell phones had better optics.Now as a gift to a youngster just starting out taking digital pictures or to have in the glove compartment as a spare, maybe it's okay, but it is not what even a very casual amateur would call a camera."
4,Reasonable photos considering the price,"Tiny camera which takes reasonable photos considering the price. A great gift for my six years old daughter who wanted a ""1000-times camera"". Outdoor photos are OK, if you remember to switch to outdoor-use (default is indoor!!!) Some of the photos shot indoor are useless, because it has not got a blitz. However if you are able to hold it still, some photos come out fair with only little light.Only disappointment: The battery (rechargeble in my case) only lasts for a day the most. It uses battery to store the photos. You have to empty the camera, when the day is over. And still you have to take out the battery....A great toy for the kid, who wants his or her first camera. Or just for the fun of it. It is really small!"
1,buy with caution,Defective when received. Even if it were in working condition you are cautioned not to load the drivers if you are using Windows 2000 and XP (and possibly 98). The drivers have not be approved by Microsoft and could damage your OS. The CD-ROM that ships with the camera does not have drivers for the later operating systems. ...
1,Almost useless,"After purchasing this camera, I noticed that the battery was dying even without images in the camera. I thought my camera defective, until I discovered this comment on p. 8 of the product manual (which can be found on amazon.com):""Even without images in the camera, the StyleCam Blink II will slowly draw battery power. To conserve battery power, after downloading images, remove the battery from camera.Caution: The camera will use battery power when a battery is inserted. Remove the battery from the camera after downloading pictures or when not in use.""Enough said."
2,"Right Idea, Wrong Execution","The Blink II would be great for those wanting a basic digital camera who realize the limitations thereof. The major flaw with this camera is the RAM memory. Thus, it requires a constant power source (even when off) to store pics in its memory. I have lost many photos on account of a battery going dead before I could get to my computer.SiPix assumes the customer has the technical savvy to conclude a constant power source is required. However, such an assumption is counterintuitive considering the device. Indeed the salesman, confounded by the camera's ""behaviour"" exchanged it for another.The need to download photos before the battery is drained defeats the purpose. The idea is portability. The Blink II requires your computer be at hand to download photos before the camera battery goes dead. Thus, the the Blink II is little better than a webcam."
3,Just a cool looking toy .. no substance,"My main issue, the selected MODE such as indoor/outdoor, high/low resolution, is not saved between power off/on. Its always defaulted to INDOOR, HIGH RESOLUTION whenever you turn the power ON.And actually, you get nice picture with INDOOR setting when you are outdoor. So, I dont mind the INDOOR settings.Also remember to download and DELETE the pictures as soon as possible. This saves the battery.For picture taking, need to have plenty of light and distance between 2-10 feet. Anything longer or shorter and you will lose the focus."
3,Erm....,"Just got this little thing today, put new battery in and took about 16 pictures, which it seemed to hold for about 4 hours or so, but not long enough for me to get it home to download. Yet, the battery indicator shows enough power, which means I had better take a spare with me to change very quickly just to hold the memory, hence the 3 star rating. But in saying that, I did get this just to learn with, as I am planning to purchase a 'proper' digital camera at some point, about the 3 or 4 megapix range.It's absolutely no good indoors with normal house lighting, but will try outdoors tomorrow to see what the limitations are, and to see how long I can keep the piccys stored before downloading with a spare battery.The 29.85 I spent on the thing would have bought me a nice lunch, but we'll see how we go.Software and drivers ok to load on win98se, and I have arcsoft studio 2000, so might try a little image editing with that. Good toy for the kids."
4,Rechargeable batteries help this one a lot,"I use a charger and a couple of rechargeable AAA batteries, downloading the pictures frequently and changing the battery once a week, and it has been a very useful tool. Sure it doesn't take photos nearly as clear as my Minolta Dimage X, but on the other hand I always have it on me (use a small belt pouch) and many of the photos look quite ok if left small. Good memory joggers. And it is cheap enough I don't worry about it, unlike the Minolta."
3,Great little camera for 5 hours at a time,"Bought this camera for my daughter. She loves it. Great for her taking photos around the house. Easily fits in her pocket and shoots good pictures. Holds lots of photos, 300 pictures at 320x240 or 70 pictures at 640x480. Easily uploads to computer. Very durable too. Only downfall is that it runs off a single AAA battery. It drains quickly in about 5 hours. At that time you have to download your pics or you lose them. Also battery drains even while turned off. Would recommend not putting batteries in until ready to shoot, and soon as finished head to a computer or laptop if on vaction, before they are gone."
2,Quality and Sipix do not meet,"The pictures on the best quality don't look normal. There is blotching resulting in blurred pictures. Even in extremely well lit situations, they still look odd. The previous model has better picture quality oddly. You would think they would get better in picture quality. I believe they just found more cost effective ways of producing the units as to reduce price. Unless your looking for extreme portability or a gift for a child, this is not a good buy."
1,"Cute, but still not worth the low price","It IS extremely small, and does actually take pictures, but the quality is much worse than you would hope for, even at 640x480. Lots of image degradation for compression (I guess), and most images come out blury, even when you try to hold the camera steady. I returned mine. Maybe in another year or two this size and price will be a better reality."
2,"Great size, but it is not very compatible","Couldn't get this camera to connect with Windows XP. I tried it on 5 different computers, using USB 1.0 and 2.0. None of them would work properly with the software that it shipped with or with the updates/fixes downloaded from the web site."
3,Could have been an awesome Camera,"This little camera could have been amazing. I know they have to keep costs down, but it seems they used a lens that gave just enough image quality to be barely acceptable and no more. If you resize the 640x480 images down to 320x240 and apply a little sharpening then they're not half bad, but the idea is to have them like that at the full 640x480. Another problem is the volatile memory. They really need flash memory, since you can almost guarantee that the camera will crash and lose that once in a lifetime shot. One good thing is that it does allow you some time to change the battery should it run out. I gave it three stars since as long as you know the limitations it can be a fun camera."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I had a trip planned to Europe and one month ago I bought a Style Cam Blink II digital camera. I tried this out a few days before my trip only to discover that it was defective- the memory chip would not hold the photos. I exchanged this camera a few days later for another, which seemed to work fine.So, I took this new Style Cam Blink II to Luxembourg and snapped a couple dozen spectacular pictures, only to have them disappear on me!! The batteries were brand new, and I also made sure to keep the camera in a safe place where the switches would not accidentally get pushed.Style Cam Blink II - what a piece of junk!!Discount price of the Style Cam Blink II- [item price]Trip to Europe $ 3,800.00Loss of a few dozen once-in- a -lifetime photo shots- pricelessIt's a shame the Clinton administration sold China nuclear secrets in lieu of camera technology.Sincerely,Frank McCarthyHuntington Beach, Ca"
1,You can't be serious...,"If you want to take pictures, use a REAL digital camera, not this little piece of junk. Now, camera phones are cool, since you can also make phone calls with them. This camera, on the other hand, probably isn't any better than a camera phone, and you can't even make phone calls. Even if this phone is better than a camera phone, it's still a piece of junk, because camera phones are a high tech as you can get for camera integrated cell phones. If this camera's only $28, it's gotta be crappy. I suggest getting a film camera or at least a 2 megapixel digital camera."
1,camera does not work,My camera has not worked since I bought it. I called twice and I was to receive a return package. I never received it and I have been so busy I almost forgot about this.I just happened to come across my camera and decided to write.The camera is cute and I would like to have it replaced. Please help.Thanks.
4,"Good read, albeit a little melodramatic","I've enjoyed Ken Follet's books in the past and thought I'd try another one. The storyline in ""A Dangerous Fortune"" was interesting with lots of twists and turns in the plot. I was a little disappointed, however, that the vixen was quite so evil; it seemed a little too melodramatic to me. It became predictable that every time the story took a turn in favor of the main character, she managed to foil it. Overall it was a good read."
4,Caught my attention from the first page,I am only about half way through this book but it is really good so far. Its no Pillars or World Without End but still really well written.
4,A Dangerous Fortune,Ken Follet always provides an intriquing story. The characters in this book become somewhat irritating by the end and you will cheer when they get their just rewards.
4,Love me some Ken Follett books!,"I have truly enjoyed reading Ken Follett books. My favorite book EVER was ""The Pillars of the Earth."" The only negative thing I could say about ""A Dangerous Fortune"" is that it was a bit formulaic and predictable. Still, I really enjoyed the read."
1,A very disappointing book,I have read several books written by this author and must say I found this book to be very poorly written -absolutely unbelievable characters and a very weak story line.It astounds me that a well known author would not have enough pride in his reputation to realise that this belongs in the rubbish bin not on an editors desk
3,A Dangerous Fortune,The book has pages of print missing at the top of each page. Page 475 through to page 506.There is a paragraph of story missing on each of these pages.
2,Not follet`s best work,"I loved Pillars of the Earth, and therefore read several of his other books, but the more I read, the more I find that his books are all so very alike and painfully predictible.Good against evil...always these unbelievably evil characters that you hate, that for a while get away with such extreme debauchery, right up until the end when the good guy prevails. For once surprise us and let the bad guy get away with it. Mix it up a bit."
3,A dangerous fortune,I really like Follett as an author but this one was a bit of a disappointment. Story starts off well but becomes predictable. Doesn't reach the heights of 'pillars of the earth' or 'world without end'. Some interesting characters and scenes though!
5,A Dangerous Fortune,Typical Ken Follet- great story and excellent writing! Follett's writing skills really take you back to the time period of the story.
3,"Okay, but not gripping...","This is my fourth Follett read and it is entertaining, but not nearly as gripping as Pillars and World Without End. Wouldn't say not worth your time, but don't expect to be sitting on the edge of your seat..."
5,Entertaining..Could not put it down!,"I love Ken Follett so it would be hard for me to say anything negative about a book he writes. I found this book especially entertaining. The characters were alive on the page. It has intrique, mystery, drama and romance and if I must say so a somewhat hollywood ending. I had just finished the Fall of Giants (the first installment of his new Century novel) and was deperate for that story to continue so I found Dangerous Fortunes. I was more than surprised that it filled the void. This is a good book and I love it for it's storytelling. Enjoy with a hot cup of tea and roaring fire. I did."
4,Ken Follett 's Dangerous Fortune,I have only read a couple Ken Follett books (so far) but I just loved this book. It was similar to Jeffery Archer's style and I have been a big fan of Jeffery Archer. The characters were so well described and the plot kept me totally turning pages right up through to the end. It was especially interesting how appropriately justice was served.
5,Follett Delivers !,"This is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. And I read a lot...really a lot.There are dozens of books which I loved and I am grateful for each one that came into my life.Dangerous Fortune is one of those books - (somewhat like ""Lonesome Dove"" or ""Kane and Able"") where you find yourself lost in another world and really caring about the characters. It is one of those books you cannot put down, yet there is a sense of loss when you have finished.And that is why I say it Totally Delivers.....it's what fiction should be."
4,Nicely written.. mindless read,A riveting story about bankers.. who would think that was possible?Well Ken Follett did a great job..very enjoyable.
5,Ken Follett fan,"I really cannot add to all the reviews already listed, just to add that this was the first Ken Follett book I ever read, and I have since read ALL of his books, except his extreme most recent(2010) book. Loved them all, especially the two monsters(900+ page) books, Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, as well as The Key To Rebecca and Lie Down with Lions, just to name two more. Had seen Eye of the Needle movie before later reading it. All very good stuff."
3,A Look at Victorian England,"Ken Follett, a true storyteller, has another engrossing book. This one takes place in the last half of the 1800's, and as usual, makes you feel as if you are there. The background and settings seem authentic, and it provides a good opportunity to see how people lived and acted back then.His basic characters are there; the scheming mother, the honest outcast, the outspoken heroine, and they are complete people. You care about them and what happens to them, and it lasts all the way through.A secret hangs over the rich and influential banking family, the Pilasters, and the wife of the leader of the family's attempts to climb the social ladder of Victorian England are hinged on how the secret is used. Family relationships are strained, fotunes gambled, and lives threatened as part of the cover-up.Although not quite as gripping as some of his other works, it is still a page turner, and an entertaining read."
3,Disappointing,"After reading Pillars of the Earth by Follett, this book is somewhat of a disappointment. Of course why would you try to compare anything with ""Pillars?"" But nothing Follett does is bad so I would say that it was worth the time I put in reading it."
2,inglorious pile of words,"follett has mastered the serial page-turner and this tome certainly fits the bill. it reads easilly, not unlike a curtain call. this pile of words is relevant, yet bloated and misleading. the culprit, murderer is obvious."
3,A Short Story Strretched Into A Novel,"Lots of good insight to the lives and times of various social strata in horse and buggy London. Classic Follett craftsmanship in the development of characters and plot elements.However, I thought it gets repetitive in demonstrating that the villains are bad and the heroes/heroines are good guys."
4,A Dangerous Fortune,"Another Ken Follett book with a great story-line, and a learning expericnce about Britian in the 1800s. A perfect historical novel, as usual."
4,Typical Follett - good historical fiction,"Not his best but not his worst - a good historical fiction page turner. If you are a Follett fan, you will enjoy..."
4,A story line that keeps you glued to the pages.,I like the history part of the story as well as all the twists in the story. It was very enjoyable.
4,A Dangerous Fortune,"I have read many of Ken Folett's novels. This was not my favorite, but still held my interest throughout. Keep up the writing, Mr. Follett. Thank you."
3,A bit disappointing.,"This novel was too much family saga for me - not up to Follett's usual standard. More Archer-like and even he has lost the plot these days. Okay reading, but not like the reader could not figure out what the ending was going to be. I would not be passing on any recommendation about this one."
5,The Dangerous Fortune,"Excellent book, highly recommend it. This is the 2nd book I read from him and once again I couldn't put it down. Follett is an excellent story writer and keeps his audience engaged in the story."
5,Excellent,This was a very enjoyable novel from the beginning to the end. I really enjoyed the main characters. Hugh was quite the hero. His dedication to his true family and friends. A great read
5,A Dangerous Fortune,"I read this when it first came out - couldn't put it down, hated for it to end. Ken Follett never disappoints."
3,A lesser work,"Ken Follett has written better than this. I found this formulaic with gratuitous sex scenes. Strong characters, however, saved it for me."
4,"entertaining, interesting : couldn't put it down","ooow, this was a good one! great story-history,family,romance,money, greed...oh, delicious!worth the read."
3,"Decent, Moderately Entertaining Work","This is a quite unremarkable, moderately entertaining work of fiction set in late 19th century England. As with another of Follett's works, A Place Called Freedom, it has little to recommend it over dozens of other similar novels set in the period.The plot revolves around the Pilasters, a wealthy and contentious banking family, whose various branches struggle for control of the family business. Subplots involving a fictitious South American country and members of the British ""underclass"" bring some spice into the history. However, as with A Place Called Freedom, the most striking aspect of the novel is its utter predictability. Twists in the story become strikingly obvious scores of pages in advance.I would rate this novel slightly above the aforementioned A Place Called Freedom, but both pale in comparison to Follett's two novels Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. Readers familiar with those works will likely be disappointed with this effort."
3,"A riveting story, but too flat","I was swept up by this story, but didn't feel that it offered anything substantial. It was like watching a soap opera: the intrigue is in seeing the villianess receive her just desserts. Unfortunately there was not much else to the story. No great prose or description. No great lesson to learn. Entertainment, but not literature."
4,A Dangerous Fortune,"Loved this book, as with all of Ken Follett's work.This one kept me on the edge of my seat, expectant as the plot unfurled.Well researched and written. Thoroughly enjoyable."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Thank heaven for books like this to make recovery from illness an easier thing. One arm with cast covering fingers, but I could still turn pages with the other hand."
5,As usual,"This was an interesting, exciting book. Pillars of the Earth is my ultimate favorite, but this book is not far behind."
3,"Good, Not Great","While this is still a good, entertaining book, I guess I am spoiled by Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. While Follett does a great job of creating various subplots and bringing them together, and the setting and time were interesting, this one was just a little too contrived for me to give the very top score. I found Micky's character very unbelievable, I found that the sexual perver-- er, preferences, that were integral to wrapping up the book were pretty contrived, and the ending wasn't very realistic. While I've reread Pillars and World because I enjoyed them so much, this one will go to the rummage sale."
4,Good story,"I have read many of Ken Follett books. A Dangerous Fortune is a very good book. Not his best, which in my opinion is World Without End. There are so many fine historical details in his books.You really feels he has put a lot of time and effort into research of the times he is describing. A Dangerous Fortune is about greed and envy, however it also gives us a great picture of life in London during the late 19th century. I hope Ken Follett will come out with more historical fiction."
4,Annoyed by spelling errors at the Kindle edition,I loved the story.But the Kindle edition has several spelling errors!Very annoying and disapointing...How can they charge for such a lousy job?
5,Reliable Follett,"Once again,Follett does not disappoint. A Dangerous Fortune is an engaging read that draws one in from page one. It tells the story of the fabulously wealthy Pilaster family, starting in the 1860's. We learn of the source of their wealth, the Pilaster Bank, and the intrigue that surrounds both the bank and their family and friends. There are good people, evil people, and just the right amount of scandalous folks too. We also learn about life in England at that time, both the rich life, and the terribly poor life. As usual with a Follett book, I didn't want it to end. Ken Follett is one of the best storytellers of our time and a total joy to read."
4,A dangerous Fortune,"Ken Follet writes an interesting story. He keeps the reader enthralled to see the outcome of the novel. I have read most of his later books and would recommend the books by Ken Follett to readers of good, fast-paced books."
4,Good,I really like all his books. They are so informative & hold my attention. Began with Pillars of the Earth & continuing through the rest
3,Not too bad a story.,The story line was not too bad. What did bother me though were all the spelling mistakes throughout the book.
5,Ken Follett's A Dangerous Fortune,"One of the best thrillers I've read for a while, a true page-turner. The plot is terrific with believable characters and a satisfying end. At the same time I learned a lot about British society and the banking industry in the late 19th century. One of Follett's best."
4,Follett still has it!,"Although this will not top my favorites by Follett, I still enjoyed the tale and feel that no matter what Follett book I pick up I'll like it. Though the story line became predictable in some places it still kept my interest. A must read if you like Follett's previous books!"
5,I love the setting & time period!,"Murder, romance, plot twists, and supreme character development all on par with Follett's other works. Really good! After finishing Follett books I'm sad because I feel like my friends are gone."
3,"quick read, but thin storyline","As usual, Ken Follett's book was a quick read. However, I found the storyline rather thin and would have appreciated more depth to the plot and detail about the financial world."
3,Dissappointed,His books usually hane more accurate historical components I felt this one lacked that. It had more pornographic situations than were needed.
4,good condition,This took a bit longer to arrive than I anticipated but the condition was as promised and I am already enjoying it.
4,Solid,"The plot isn't as good as it could be, but the character development is outstanding! I feel like I know Hugh and Augusta better than I know some friends!"
4,Dangerous Fortune,"As an audiobook, I love the reader's voice. A timely story, the fall of a London banking family. Intrigue, unrequited love, an old crime unpunished, international involvement. The ingredients of a Ken Follett novel. One of his better stories. A very interesting story."
4,"""Dynasty"" in Elizabethan England!!!","That's how I'd describe this book. It shows an inner look into a powerful english banking family. Like any family, they have their secrets, and quite a few perversions too!This is definitely not my hostorical era of choice, but the story pulls you in, and keeps you fascinated until the last page.A solid story that didn't disappoint. Give it a shot!"
4,A fun read,"A good story, highly entertaining read. The story is centered around a family of bankers and follows the event through half a generation."
3,Great entertainment,"The last 200 pages of this book simply fly. Some of the plot twists aren't particularly original, but the author certainly knows how to hook the reader with his prose. A worthwhile, memorable read, but definitely not classic literature."
4,pretty good but notnhing new.,"Follet's good. Real good, but it doesn't seem like there's anything new. I read richard greenwald's spear of golgotha - first of series of thrillers and couldn't believe the stuf they publish down under- the aussies know how to make you buckle up and take a roller coaster ride. If you liked the earlier Follet you'll go nuts over greenwald- his stuff is too good to believe you can't put it down"
4,"Good Story, Keeps getting better and better","This was the third book of Ken Follett I have read. In addition I do not read a lot. However, this book had a great story that kept getting better and better. There were a lot of characters and it took a while to get them straigh and their relationship with one another. However there was a family tree chart in the front of the book that helped. I definately enjoyed it and would highly recommend it..."
2,This is your book .. If you like soup opera,"This is my seccond Ken Follet book, the firstone was ""World whithout end"". I have found the two books very similar, almost identical, what it changes is the era. But the evil characters are very very evils and the good ones are almost saints. So in both books the bad guys take it all from the good ones, but at the end, the good ones win and the bad ones get punished. But if you like a good soup opera, this could be your book, the plots are typically of this kind of TV shows."
5,I keep coming back to this one,"I keep coming back to this book because of the connection between homophobia and crime which Follett develops in the relationships among Micky Mirnada, Augusta Pilaster (the family matriarch) and Edward Pilaster. I have always felt that Follett presents realistic characters, and this book is no exception.Follett is also a master at portraying the era whenever he writes historical fiction, and Dangerous Fortune does not disappoint in this regard.Dangerous Fortune is also a work I would call Economic Fiction and Follett does an excellent job of portraying the finacial and banking industries of Victorian England."
2,Not Very Dangerous,"This book did not meet my expectations, after the Pillars of the Earth and its following. These characters are all so shallow and the story predictable. I'm surprised I read it to the end. It was an early book, so I guess he saved the best to come."
4,Great Book,"I can't say that I liked this book as much as Pillars of the Earth or World Without End, but it was still great. I was intrigued through the whole thing."
3,Not much depth.,"This book looked promising, but within the first three chapters, it was pretty easy to figure out who were the villains, who was the hero and what the outcome would be at the end of the book. Very little depth of characters compared to his other novels. It was a good ""I really don't want to think too hard about what I'm reading"" book - easy to pick up and put down. Enjoyable, yet disappointing at the same time. Expected more from Follett."
3,Formulaic Ken Follett,"Admittedly not his most recent work, but has the structure and plot development that have become very familiar in Mr. Follett's novels. Not necessarily a bid thing, but not for those seeking something original or different."
4,aA DANGEROUS FORTUNE,"THOUGHT THIS STORY TOLD THE BANKING RISKS IN THE 19TH CENTURY. THIS WAS BEFORE THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FEDERAL GOVT. INSURANCE OF MONIES TO DEPOSITORS. ALSO, THE STORY WAS VERY REALISTIC."
2,A Tiresome Fortune,"Follett uses his familiar formula for this 19th Century financial saga. Weakened by predictable characters and excessive, unnecessary and tiresome sex scenes. I gave up at the half-way point. Too many good books out there to put up with this mediocre tale."
3,"Not terrible, not great","You will easily be able to finish this book, you won't be bored and give up reading it. However the characters seem recycled, the plot was not terribly unpredictable, and little effort was put into immersing the reader into the atmosphere of the book. Follett can and has written incredible novels but this one seems like a bland, generic version of a Follett novel. I was disappointed."
3,Entertaining but predictable,"I checked this out of the library as an audio book, and I would say this is a perfect choice for a road trip. I would not have wasted my time reading, nor would I purchase this book. The characters are unbelievable--the main character is the ethical Hugh who is crossed over and over by his purely evil Aunt Augusta, and yet he never sees it coming and keeps coming back for more. By the end of the book I could barely care about Hugh--there's innocent and then there's obtuse. The plot is pretty predictable at times, the characters are flat & mostly one dimensional, the ""coincidences"" are as unbelievable as those of any Gothic novel, and much of the story is hard to believe given the time setting.However, for a long car ride, it was perfect--certainly didn't have to think too much and the story does mostly keep you engaged."
3,not upto Ken's standards,easy reading...good character descriptions..but not a very gripping plot or storyline like the usual follett style...an overnight time-killer read though
5,A model for Government,"It is doubtful that any contemporary official could write such an elegant and comprehensive work. Raffles not only left his post as Governor of Java, with the routine reports, but an analysis of the culture and languages. In his dedication to the Prince Regent he stated: ""To uphold the weak, to put down lawless force, to lighten the chain of the slave, to sustain the honour of the British arms and British good faith; to promote the arts, sciences and literature, to establish humane institutions, are duties of government... I have had the honour, as a servant of the East India Company, to preside over a mild and simple people ... and by doing everything in my power to make them happy.""This is an artifact of the British Empire at its finest."
3,Too Brief,"Whilst this book was well written and interesting it was very short, only 128 pages. It only touched briefly on the main topics of her life, I was left wanting to know more. Very expensive for such a short book, wouldn't have spent $28 had I been aware of this."
5,Mini bio of Oprah,"Pictures were great, easy reading, but not quit what was expected for price paid. Not store's problem. Their processing was great & quick."
1,condition is not nearly as good as said,"When I bought this book, it was said that the condition is like new. But actually the book is very old. There are library sticks all over outside of the book. It seems I got from a library."
1,Professional framing is very cheap,"Don't be fooled by the ""professionally framed"" ad...it is a very cheap wood frame and poster is behind plastic. not worth the extra $22.00...would rather pay to have it actually ""professionally framed"""
3,very small poster,"I should have paid more attention when ordering. It was much smaller than I thought and their were no poster frames or any frame for that matter, that it fit in. It was a very detailed poster but just too small to appreciate."
2,Strange book,"This book teaches you how to develop a very simple old fashion game( 2D ,256 colors 640x480 , one aircraft and some birds , that's all!!!) but it expects that you know C++ at a senior class level. It is a nonsense, in my opinion. The book is however well organized, you can see that the author is a professor , by the way, this was the main reason why I purchased it. This is also the only reason why I rate it 2 instead of 1 star."
4,Great for those just starting out,"This is a good book for people who have never dealt with DirectX. It's based on Dr. Parberry's lectures from the game programming class he teaches at the University of North Texas. It goes through a simple 2D game explaining every step from start to finish.--------------> this isn't a reference book <----------------It's meant to give you starting point -- some basic knowledge that you can build on as you become a better game programmer. If you need a DirectX reference (and you will), buy something like Inside DirectX.The book expects you to know C++. At UNT it's a senior-level class. You're expected to know what you're doing by the time you get there.I only have a few minor problems with it:1. the coding style can be hard to read in some places2. there are some typos (but, thankfully, not in the code)3. and the game you end up with is GOD AWFUL. But now you can use what you learned to make outstanding games on your own.It's a great learning tool."
2,Too much of HIS game...,"At first when I saw this book I thought it would be great for learning the basics of 2D game programming because it said it was based on his ""2D Side Scroller"" Ned's Turkey Farm. So I thought there would be helpful lessons on any 2D game and then show how he implemented it in his 2D games. Well, first of all of the lessons are specifically for his game Ned's Turkey Farm, and the game isn't even much of a a 2D side scroller.Also the way the code is written is ... well just plain bad. He doesn't really cover much about the Win32 API and what he does cover is bad. He uses simplified techniques that gets the job done when a reader copies, but doesn't tell how to use it so they can go off and make something different.All in all, buy this book if you want to learn how to make this game, check it out or browse through it if you want to learn a few things. Chances are if you are a newbie you wont learn from this, if you are a bit experienced this book will seem sloppy and too basic."
1,Absolutely Painful to Watch,This is one of the most painful videos I have ever watched. I do not know Brian Sewell but assume he has some sort of following. The video is more about him than Italy. And he rambles forever on random thoughts. Do not buy unless you want to watch Brian.
4,Interesting,Wished it more of the streets and people walking around. Trying to figure out what to wear this coming Carnival in Venice for the first time.
4,Tumb Raider: Unfinished Business; Reviews,A great piece of three-demetional action software built to fit your computer screen be it 12 in. to 23 in.
3,Haba Ball Track Construction Set,"Pros: the blocks are well made and durable. My 3-year-old son enjoys playing with it.Cons: the blocks are stacked on top of each other and/or put adjacent to each other to construct a ball track. They have to be pretty much perfectly aligned for the track to work properly, which is a very difficult task for little kids to handle (hence, you have to do it). Since these blocks cannot be attached to each other, they can easily go out of alignment after a number of runs (marble runs), not to mention when accidentally bumped by the kid(s).Comments: It would be a major improvement if the blocks are designed so that they can be attached to each other. The toy is fairly expensive."
3,"Well made, fun to build but unstable","We bought this set for the kids last Christmas. They love the set, and love to build runs, but they get frustrated trying to keep it together and expand it. The blocks are very well made and the pieces align perfectly, but they don't ""stick"". Every marble that runs down the track knocks the pieces slightly out of alignment. It only takes a few marbles to break the flow. It's a constant effort to maintain the track.I had planned to add more of the specialty pieces over time, but they are pricey, and the kids don't play with it long enough due to the constant realignment requirement. Not sure if I will now."
3,I wish I knew what this stuff was like....,"I ordered it in mid june, and they changed my shipping estimate to late august now. so already a month later, I have to wait over a month for it still.Plus, I just found a whole bunch of these at BigLots! for $2 each. I have never had a product from Amazon take so long to ship. The longest anything else took was a week and a half. I am very disappointed."
4,"Excellent to watch, but at best FAIR to GOOD as a teaching tool","This is a WONDERFUL production, well acted and interestingly staged, using modern costuming. McKellan and Dench are in fine form, both as malevolent as they need to be.As a teacher, however, I found this DVD to be a major disappointment, because for some silly reason the publisher did not bother to offer subtitles (which are immensely valuable to aid students' comprehension of a fairly difficult text)."
3,Sovet Union's realias,The book contains USSR's realias. It is interesting to use this book with the contemporary one. Grammar section is strong.
2,Not the first Howard you should get,"This album comes about 2-3 records after his best work, unfortunately. Howard was one of the original smooth jazzers, blending traditional playing with comntemporary song structure and themes, to great, listenable effect. On this record, however, he sounds like he's just trying to keep up with all of the younger or more popular jazz artists who took what he did and ran with it. If you aren't familiar with his work, start off with ""Love Will Follow"" or ""Personal"". This is an unsure, uneven record, even for fans of his work or smooth jazz."
5,Smooth and mellow artist,I love George Howard music.I will always purchase anything that is recorded by this talented and gifted artist. This is a must buy and a collectors Cd. The seller sent the Cd out in records time.
3,More philosophical than practical but still good,"This is a good book to get a proper mindset for raising missionary support. However, it lacks in very much practical how-to information which is what we need right now. I found Funding Your Ministry by Scott Morton to be much more helpful."
2,lasted only one child,"we used the changing table for our first child, during the move we had to get rid of it, it lost stability and structure, I would not recommend this product if you are looking to use it for more than one baby. I am on the hunt for a new changing table/dresser combo"
3,Fit Form and Function,"Bought this over 2 years ago , so I cant' comment on the pricing now. We got it as a set and at a good deal,It survived my daughter climbing it, doing pull-ups on it, and learning to open and slam a drawer. The only thing it didnt' last was sub-standard movers. Paint job took some serious blows before it started to chip. I like the drawer and I like DaVinci items in general."
4,changing table with dresser,"Haven't had the chance to use this yet because our son isn't due until February but it's in very good condition, was easy to assemble and it looks great in his room. We also bought the crib and mattress to match. Very happy with our purchase and it arrived at our home quickly."
2,looks nice from far away,"in a nutshell, this looks nice from far away,but is a piece of junk. It's overpriced for what you get. It came out of the box scratched, took 5 hours to put together, missing screws and holes not drilled. 2 of 3 whole drawer front panels (handles and all) FELL OFF within 1 month, I had to elmer's glue them back on. Lame! If this was $80 it'd be worth it. It's a pretty color. Thats the nicest thing I can say about it. If I could do it over, I'd spend the extra money on a real piece of furniture!"
2,"very cheap, disappointed","we buy a lot of stuff on amazon, and frankly I am really disappointed with the quality of this unit. don't let it fool you, the sides and back are cheap particle board. The rest of the frame is pine. the drawers are really cheap balsa wood too. For nursey furniture, stick with your local dealer. We assembled this one fine and it works ok, but I am worried it is going to fall apart every time we use it. would not get this one again."
1,Very bad quality for dresser,We bought this dresser because it matched the crib. The shelves are made of cheap wood and broke apart after 2 mo use. The particle board wood side split down the middle and the front panel came apart from one of the shelves. Terrible quality. Would not buy this brand/product again!!!
4,DaVinci Changer,"My husband and I received our order very quickly (we also ordered the Emily Crib). The crib and changer look great together. The quality of the changer isn't the best but for the price I think it is good. There is a lot of MDF-type material used for the dresser-the 2 sides, back and drawer bottoms. However, it is sturdy and will definately stylishly serve it's purpose."
1,Very flimsy buy something else,I have gently used this changing table for 5 months and it is wobbly and made from the cheapest materials. The bottom of the drawers is very much like a thin form of cardboard and only slightly stronger. The bottom of the top drawer has caved in already. Outrageously poor materials for the price. Assembly was fine and it arrived with all parts and undamaged. Buying this changing table was like throwing away money. I'm very disappointed.
2,Time consuming assembly & not lasting,"Only consider this item if you have several hours to devote to assembly. (That's one huge advantage to hand-me-down's-- they are already put together!)We are having problems with the drawer fronts. We consider ourselves pretty good at furniture assembly-- I've worked in a furniture store assembling floor models and my husband is an architect-- so I think we assembled this correctly but it is not staying put together. So far two of the three drawer fronts have come off while using the product. The first came off after 6 months of use and the second after 10 months. The second time, when the right side of the drawer front pulled away from the drawer, a piece of the left side of the drawer cracked off in response. Because the hardware is fault we've had to use glue to try to put this back together. I doubt it will hold for very long."
3,"Looks good, drawers are flimsy","The good news is you're probably only using this for baby clothes--which are little and lightweight. The bad news is that even a drawer stuffed with onsies will be too much for the flimsy particleboard drawer bottoms. We've had this dresser for 3 1/2 years now. It makes a terrific changing table, and we still use if for that purpose for our second kid. But... the drawers are truly worthless. The fronts and sides are solid wood and very sturdy, but the super-lightweight drawer bottoms bow out and then pop out of their slots with even the tiniest load. At this point, we've given up on one of the drawers, which is bowed out so badly that clothes slide right out and into the drawer below. We stuck that one in the middle, and only use the top and bottom. It's a shame, though, because otherwise it's a pretty solid piece. I'm turning the dresser over to my carpenter mother later this summer and she's going to rebuild the drawers to be usable."
3,Great looking but lightweight drawer construction,"I was hoping for a better quality. Solid in the exterior construction but the drawers are so lightweight that they have to be opened with both hands, slowly, or they catch. It is pretty in the espresso color and I hope to update this in a year with how it is holding up!"
2,ok.. but drawer fell on my foot!!,"anyway,I got this before my son was born.. I was happy with it at first.. it looks great and it seems very sturdy.. the changing surface is big enough and everything.. but my son is 4 months old and the drawers are falling apart...! they are coming out of the hinges.. (yes my husband put it together right) ;)anyway, the other night the whole front part of the drawer came off alltogether when I was looking for an outfit ... it fell right on my foot!! I am dissapointed.. we're gonna get some wood glue for that thing!! :)... If that doesnt happen to you.. then it is a good investment!"
3,"Looks good, but not well made!","We got the DaVinci Emily Dresser/Changer and Crib. They were easy to put together and I love the way they look, but they are not well made! My 9 month old neice was over last weekend and while changing her, the whole dresser would shake side to side because of her wiggling. Also, I opened a drawer to put some clothes away, and the front fell off causing the side of the drawer to crack.We were able to put it back together, and put some wooden braces across the back which have made it a lot sturdier, but this was a lot more work than we expected."
1,Dissapointed,"After I ordered this in white, it arrived in Ebony. When I called back the seller they said it was my fault and that I ordered the wrong color. Seller also said that they could not get the white from DaVinci and that they could receive it back in their warehouse but I had to pay the shipping. I had to pay $86.00. to send this back to them, besides having to pay for shipping their ridiculous restocking fee was 50% ot the dresser price. I did not even open the box when it arrived, I sent if back in pristine condition. In summary, I lost $200.00 and got no product. After this, I ordered the white one from Target."
1,Very bad design,"We bought this dresser well over two and a half years ago and we have been using it since few times a day. The dresser is sturdy (become less so in time, but still okay) and besides some scratches in the wood it looks okay.However, I would not recommend to buy this dresser because of the poor design. The gap between the top horizontal bars is an accident waiting to happen. A leg (or a chubby knee in my son's case) can get stuck in the gap. In our case we needed to take the upper bar apart to release the knee....I admit I did not pay attention to this till now, because our older son was always so relaxed during diaper change. But our younger son is everything but relaxed.. and already managed to get his knee badly stuck in the gap.. I'm now looking for a new dresser with a better design.Although the positive comment I have regarding the sturdiness and material, I am giving this dresser one star because safety comes first."
3,Three stars feels about right,"It's really borderline whether or not to even be able to recommend this movie. It feels more like a documentary than a story.More than any other DC comic movie or show, this one consists largely of repetitive dialogue along with lots of running and jumping. That would be fine if there was a strong story the back it up, but this, as I said, was more like a documentary....a chance to observe Batman as he deals with probably the most emotionally charged period of his life. For somebody unfamiliar with the comic series that spawned this movie, it was interesting, but that's about it.Mask Of The Phantasm was a much better Batman movie. And if you're looking for some good super hero animation with original and entertaining storylines, a much better bet is the Justice League Unlimited series."
4,batman under the red hood,this movie is one of batman best bout the studios need to put spanish audio on all of the knew movies what is the point of havin all the space in the blue ray if they not goin to add spanish audio they got portuges audio bout they dont have the spanish audio come on who in the ...speaks portuges in usa.. spanish its the secondary bigest language after english come on dc think
4,The Dark Knight's greatest failure - What a story!,"Yes, this is a great Batman story, I can't give it a 5 star just because it only run for a bit longer than an hour. I wished this had been a full on 2 Hour or so film. This story was so complex, dark and action packed that it deserved to be developed a lot more. It is clear that this kind of film is geared towards a more mature audience, and having the longer film would satisfy all of us Batman fans... Let's hope DC realizes this sooner than later as I really want to watch an evolution in the development of these straight to DVD comics.Other than that, this is a great film! You will not regret watching this. I don't want to give out too much, but the story is about Batman's failure to rescue the 2nd Robin from the Joker and the events that followed after that."
4,Another brilliant Batman animated film,This is a brilliant film. Really enjoyable watch & very dark. Still can't beat Mask of the Phantasm but it has come really close.The Jonah Hex short is also very good & enjoyable.
4,amazing,"This was truly the batman cartoon I've been waiting for, for so long. The story ran smoothly and seamlessly. I will admit that the first scene Joker's voice was a bit off putting, but it eventually grows on you. Having NPH as Nightwing worked surprisingly well. Jensen Ackles was phenomenal, I can't think of a better person for the part. Animation is also really well done"
4,Great Movie but....,"Great Movie, but the packaging is very basic. Filmsy construction, one page insert, etc. The DVD arrived in great condition within two days, five days faster than what I signed up for! For those who want an experience unmatched by other Batman movies, this is the one! The Joker character has a very hilarious and some what scary aspect to him more so than in previous films. I wouldn't recommend this for youngsters but for the 18+ crowd, its a hoot! For those who just want the movie and not the special features, pick this one!"
2,animate movie,bad movie.any moment i think was a real movie and nt a animate movie. but its my falt. next time need to read al about the movie.
1,Awful for little kids,"This was the worst `cartoon' choice I ever made for a grandchild! My 4 YO grandson lives to see anything Batman.Batman is his hero. This is the darkest `cartoon' I've ever seen. I turned it off immediately when I realized what a poor choice I had made in purchasing this for an impressionable child. It has blood and gratuitous violence . It left my grandchild worried about the characters who were hurt (Altho I turned it off as soon as possible.) Definitely not for small kids or even Batman admirers. If I could have taken the one star I gave it off ,I would , but it didn't come off when I tried to remove it."
1,Voices are all wrong.,Why couldn't they get the real voice cast to do it? The joker's voice in particular is just awful.
5,A Silk Purse from Sows' Ears,"This is the best animated Batman movie I've ever seen. They managed to take some less-than-stellar storylines and characters and blend them into an action packed 75 minute film that hits all the right notes. Great voice acting and animation. Highly recommended, especially to Batman fans."
4,Keeps getting better and better,"At first I thought it was going to be a crappy Batman movie, they didn't have Kevin Conroy, but after I started watching, the story was dark, the voice acting was top notch, and the action was great. The Batman movies, live action and animated, just keep getting better and better. If you don't see this one you have missed out and if your a fan and you don't have this in your collection your crazy because this is a must have."
5,Unbelievable,"""Under the Red Hood"" is what fans have been waiting for ever since the ""Death in the Family"" story line. This animation stands out from all the recent DC Universe animated films (I'm talking about all of the superman/batman crossovers, GL movies, and even the JL films) in that the emotional response elicited from the viewers is real and powerful. No doubt the storyline being based on the comic stories of Jason Todd has something to do with this, but when you watch this animation, you will agree with me that it could seamlessly be translated into a blockbuster live action film.Combining all of the classic elements of BTAS and the crisp modern production values of today's DC feature films, and adding a spice of realism and maturity that can only rightfully be explored in Batman's realm, ""Under the Red Hood"" is a work of art. This is the graphic equivalent of Chris Nolan's ""The Dark Knight."" You will not be disappointed by this instant DC modern classic."
5,blu,"I think so far is the best dc animated movie, great story and great voice acting. Good extra content about the original comic story, for the real fans, Jonah hex short much better than the crappy live action movie"
5,Great movie and a lot of fun!,"I'm a huge batman fan just like the rest, I may not read the comics, but love the story.The animation, the action, the fight scenes, the story - everything was awesome!"
5,Cenima quality,"Don't look down on this movie because it's animated. Most, if not all, DC animated films are cenima quality (especially considering the mass of terrible films coming out lately), people just don't give them a chance because it's a ""cartoon"". This is an excellent movie with plenty of action, story development, acting and twists. I won't give anything away, but don't pass it up."
5,Good movie,"A good movie for any fan of DC characters. The best thing, is Nightwing finally gets some some movie love"
5,Raises the Bar,"I have all of the DC animated video releases, including Green lantern, the Batman/Superman team-ups, Wonder Woman, Doomsday, Gotham Knight, New Frontier etc. This new release changes everything, resetting an already-high bar and making the claim for an altogether new standard in animated films. In short, get this now if you don't have it already. It is by far the most darkly complex, emotionally charged and action-filled DC animated film ever. I was blown away!"
3,WARNING - Incompatible Digital Copy,"Be warned -- the digital copy is limited to Windows Media DRM and related PlaysForSure-compatible devices. No iTunes, no iPod Touch, and no iPhone. I really wish there was a standard for digital copies. Further, I wish this was clearly stated in the product description."
4,It is a dark movie ....,liked the movie but it was a bit dark.....the joker had no redeeming qualities....the writing could of been better....liked the graphics and the computer animation of the movie......
5,Best DCAU to date,"To put it simply, the story hear is much better than the one that was in the comics.No Superboy BS. No unraveling reality. Just a good gritty, violent, Batman story.I voted for Jason to die back in the 80's. I hated him as Robin, but I LOVE him as the Red Hood."
3,Good movie,"Entertaining plot, the animation is great... but the drawings and designs of the characters, not up to what I expected. Anyway, you'll have a good time if you like good old bats..."
5,"Great movie, excellent plot","This is one of the best written Batman movies ever.Excellent storyline, great character usage, good action scenes, great voice casting and amazing animation.This is one movie worth 100% of the price."
3,not for me,i was lookin for some cool comic book cartoon movies for mature audiences like hbo's spawn(any suggestions?). i watched 10 minutes oif it and didnt like it at all. i think is for a younger audience.
4,"Good, basic envelopes","These are good for what they are -- basic, gummed envelopes for a low price. The security tinting works ok, not as dark as some, but still passable, and the paper is of a low enough quality that the envelopes crinkle and roll a bit after going through a laser printer, but they still work.If you want something very professional, I'd look somewhere else, but for basic mailing purposes, these are good for the price."
4,Great envelopes,"I needed more envelopes, so I ordered these envelopes. They are great...They hold together go...They are a great price too. I guess 500 envelopes is a little bit more then the normal person need, but I write/send a lot of stuff. Thank you."
2,Poor quality!,The movie skipped and was un-watchable after half was already played. Not a good quality DVD at all!
5,My 2nd read,I read this book 10-12 yrs ago and have never forgotten it. I loaned the book to someone and never got it back. It was difficult to find again and I am so thankful I found it again on Amazon. Sadly enough it makes so much sense and the information can be verified. It is a major eye opener. It is frightening on one hand but on the other it gives us courage and strength at the end. I would be very interested in hearing from other readers.
1,The Old Hrb Doctor,"I can't believe that anyone would be so stupid as to use many of these concoctions! For instance drinking a tea made with plantain, comfrey or poke root is extremely dangerous. Those herbs are for external use only. I am very surprised that this is the same author who wrote the Herbalist, (green cover hardcover 1918, 1932, 1934,1976) which is a very fine book. This is a waste of time especially when there are so many other remedies that a person could use both then and now."
5,Tears and Smiles,"This video has a much more emotional touch to it than most of the series. If you're a Ryoko fan, be prepared to grab some tissues, cause our favorite demoness is at her best here. I know I cried. The music fits the scenes well, and should leave you at a loss for words when you're done. Ayeka fans....well, you don't see too much of Ayeka, but she does do something that shouldn't suprise you at the end. Oh, and Ryoko fans..........you will be VERY happy to see the end of this video."
5,"Cool, Cool Video!","I like this video better than all the other Tenchi Universe Videos because this contains more action and has suspense. The best part I like is when Tenchi and the Gang goes to meet this ""Yoshow"" guy. Who says he is Yoshow. Turns out that this ""Yoshow"" character is Kagatow. Tenchis Grandpa, Lord Katsohito is really Yoshow. Kagatow being a dumb fool himself, thinks the Tenchi and the gang are not smart, but man is he wrong! This video you should really get. It contains four episodes and many exciting action always coming ahead."
5,The Tears and Smiles of Friendship,This video has more of an emotional touch to it than the other Tenchi videos. if you're a Ryoko fan this might be a little to sad for you. And if you're a Ryoko fan this video might just be the thing you are looking for. If you ask me Tenchi and Ryoko have something serious going on.
3,Guidecraft Sunflower Kitchen,"I took 4 shipments for us to get a kitchen that was not damaged. They all were damaged pretty bad in th same spots. The color of the kitchen & refrigerator is not the same. One is very white and the other is off white. It is very cute but a little dissapointed with the quality and color. My daughter does lov it though. The company was more than helpfull, it was just a paint to wait alomost 4 weeks to get something dhe could play with."
2,corn!,"My parents bought this brand for our cats growing up because one had urinary problems as a kitten. All three cats were overweight and two of them developed feline diabetes. I researched feline diabetes and found out this kind of food (mostly corn and corn by product) is really terrible for cats. As an adult I feed my own two cats better food (high protein, no corn, fist five ingredients are meat) and they are sleek, slim, active, healthy cats. They are free-fed indoor cats and almost six years old. They don't eat as much so we don't need to buy as many bags. The extra vet trips and supplies for a diabetic cat (test strips, insulin, needles) are also pretty expensive.Your cat might like to eat this food but it's not a good diet for them. Any food with corn as the first two ingredients is a poor choice."
5,Saved a big vet bill!,"Suddenly our adult male cat was ""Doing his business"" everywhere but the litter box and he didn't look any happier about it then we were. I checked the internet for possible reasons and purchased this new food for him and our female cat. Worked like a charm. Took about a week and a half and were ALL happy now! Great product!"
5,Takes care of my cat with urinary problems and is a great price!,I used to buy from Giant but then I found this on Amazon. It is twice as much as I can get in the Giant Store and last for two months. The price a lot less than I've been paying in thegrocery store. I will order one every 2 months as long as they offer it. I'm happy!! And so are Stella Dallas and Snowy!!
4,The boycat likes it,"I have this food delivered because my male cat had a urinary tract infection and some blockage a couple of years ago and was hospitalized and prescription-only food recommended. I used that for several months but then found this purina brand. He hasn't had any more problems, and whether that is due to the food I don't know, I'm just trusting the label. This product is more pricey than regular cat food but is also more concentrated, less full of air, so a large bag lasts quite awhile."
5,great food for urinary problems,this product is great and my cats have not had any kidney problems since they started eating this years ago
2,Not a healthy food.,"Thought I'd try this as a cheaper alternative to the expensive prescription diet my vet recommended. Researched further & added canned food, cranberry supplement, & water fountain. No problems so far & feel much better that my cats are back on their meat-base food. This stuff even smells bad. Was worried since a Purina brand & I normally do not buy any of these poor quality foods, but tried it."
4,A book fit for the coffee table,"This book provoked consumer behavior for me. I am shopping for a good coffee table on which to place it. _Hiding_ is marvellous to look at, as well as to read. Taylor offers a sequence of interrelated inquiries into perceptions of the relations between the surface and the ""realities"" underneath. These inquiries are concerned with phrenology and eugenics, body piercing and gold-card fashions. This book may not emerge as the most important in recent postmodern theory, but it is one of the more enjoyable reads. With it located on the coffee table, your guests will believe you're hip to the latest theoretical fashions, your children will wonder what you're thinking, and your housekeeper will quit smoking to read during breaks."
2,programming,hard to get the upgrade number and doesnt always work with windows vista I change computers and could get it set up with out send a picture of me and the box to darkbasic
2,A Comedy Trashed By Its Own Stuff.,"Although all three Porky's movies got laughs throughout their individual runs, the laughs where not because the jokes where actually funny. Most of the humor could more closely be compared to that which one might find on bathroom walls. There is nothing intelligent involved in any of the three features. Also the mild teen porn used in all three films didn't help them either. I admit that I did laugh but, it was not at the jokes it was at how stupid they all were. Thus if you have nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon watching the Porky's Trilogy might ease the bordom."
3,background sound lacking,"Though the music may have been lovely in the proper setting, I found singing during meditation very distracting. If you are like me and want calming beautiful instrumentals without vocals, pass this cd up. I also found the tone of the male guide's voice somewhat annoying."
5,Magical,"Through Healing Light, Dr. Jan Berlin and Lizbeth Scott were able to guide me to a place where my spirit experienced an awakening unlike any other. I was awed by the beauty of Ms. Scott's music and intrigued by the places I saw and the wisdom I experienced through this truly remarkable journey. Healing Light is a wonderful tool for deeper understanding of oneself."
1,miss piggy does opera,"if you find the idea of miss piggy yelping arias in the background whilst relaxing...then by all means buy this cd.after reading all of the good reviews of this cd I thought I'd like it. I love Loreena McKennit, and some Enya so I didn't think I'd mind vocals in the background... ugh!The vocals are not relaxing at all! and they distract from the rest of the cd. I was very disappointed."
2,rip off,When I ordered this I thought it was a album. Instead it is only two songs on each side. I checked back on the title and nowhere does it say it's really a single. As for the content they are the greatest. (ABBA).
4,Simple and easy to install - fit the bill,"We were looking to hide an unsightly support bar we needed as a part of a kitchen renovation. This covered the bar perfectly, hangs above the stove and does fit the bill aesthetically."
1,Not so great,I bought this for the hot summer days. This product is made cheaply and started to leak the first time I put water in it.
1,So disappointed!!! Why????,This was so disappointing--Looks like a family movie--nothing mentioned on the back--no rating--Then two men in bed together--come on!!! Where has this world gone--so sad.
2,Road to Christmas,"Sadly, I have to say, I did not find this movie anything but a soppy romance with very poor acting. The storyline was a little typical and could have been overcome if the characters had portrayed themselves as believable. But, I will say, I did watch it to the end, possibly waiting for it to get better!!!Maxmo"
1,The Road to Christmas,"Loved this movie til the end. Now... not never would I include this in my Christmas movies library for my children. Not a family movie in my opinion because of the homosexual content. Being involved with a woman was the expected and acceptable end to the relationship. Believe it or not, that is NOT the norm in families."
1,"Not a family movie, Nudity, and gay right activist thinking.","Very sad to see this dvd. It had very little dressed models at the beginning, and filthy speech, and at the end a gay agenda. Very sad that anyone would recommend this movie for a family. Wish I had never seen it. Not happy about this movie at all."
3,poor ending,"a terrific movie until it was spoiled by having a young girl see 2 gay men in a bed. it""s a christmas movie not a social awareness movie."
1,TV wants kids to think gay is okay,"could have been a great movie, but finding your male fiance in bed with another man in a family movie----please."
3,road to Christmas,"I really like Jennifer Grey so I ordered this movie. I also like Christmas movies.This one is a little slow with the plot, not really much plot at all. It was okay. I probably won't be watching it again, so I can't recommend buying it."
2,Surprise!,"Enjoyed the story until fiance found in bed with another man. Definitely not appropriate for a ""family"" holiday movie. Enough said."
1,Should rank 0 out of 5 stars!,"This story had huge potential. The relationship between the father and daughter was wonderful, the romance totally worked, and the progress the three characters made on their shared journey was believable and sweet. However, this movie ended with disaster! Seriously, if you want to kill an existing relationship and make way for a better one, there are far better ways to move the plot along~ And, the reaction of the leading lady to her devastating betrayal was seriously minimized. Whoever created this story took talent and a good creation and flushed them down the toilet just to be sensationalistic. Please, do not waste your time!"
1,Worst of the Lifetime DVD bundle,"I was hoping to have a ""keeper"" bundle, but 2 out of the 5 Lifetime movies in the ""2010 Christmas Bundle"" (this movie ""Road to Christmas"" the worst)had what appeared to be another gay agenda, which made no sense and did not fit in with the plot at all. ""Home by Christmas"" was the best, ""Holiday Switch"" was very good, ""Comfort and Joy"" was also very good, but had a scene with 4 gay guys watching TV which added nothing and made no sense at all, like a bizarre ""throw in"". I just want my voice heard, family viewing Christmas/anytime movies are still in high demand!"
2,Not a family movie!,"I purchased the movie before any reviews were out. Big mistake! I would have neverbought it if I had known a gay scene was included in what was supposed to have beena family Christmas movie.What irked me the most was that it was a pretty decent movie till nearly the end,when they threw in that shocker. When one of the actors tried to explain thesituation to his young daughter, she made a comment to the effect that she knew allabout that because someone in her 5th grade class came out of the closet, and gee, Dad, it's really no big deal. Really?!?Normally, when I buy a movie new, I donate it to our local library after I watch it.Not this time! What a waste of money!"
1,The Road to Christmas,Very disappointed. Foul language and gay's just don't cut it with me. Especially for a Christmas movie. Hollywood always has to spoil everything.
2,disappointing,"I thought this was going to be a family movie and it was going along pretty good until Jennifer Gray finally reaches her destination with her companions following as though it was no big deal to walk into someones house all the way to the bedroom where she found her fiance' in bed with another man. Give me a break! That's is a plot for a good Family Christmas Story? He could have at least been with another woman as everyone was trying to warn her about when she said her fiance' was Italian. The other woman could have been coming out of the shower with a towel wrapped around her or something along that line. That, at least, small children could get a grasp on what was going on in watching a movie with Mom and Dad. I am still fuming over the movie this morning after watching it last night. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry!"
5,Love it!,"This is another one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies! Since I'm a huge believer in fate, I believe that is one of main reasons why I enjoy this movie."
3,.,"Changing a ""spoiled"" rich sucssesful work-aholic woman and following her ""adventures"" and struggles on reching her destionation, finally being picked up by a father/dather traveling the back ""slow roads towd grandma's home was a eye opener on how different her selfish life is compared to the selflessness of these two strangers. Needless to say more than her life was changed.The only drawback was the unnessary slang used in this story. :("
4,Great Magazine Holder,Fits comfortably next to the commode and it very inconspicuous. Keeps magazines from getting torn and tattered and holds a great many publications at once. I love the heft and sturdiness of this product and highly recommend it and can see many uses for this magazine holder.
3,"bent, but functional","I love the premise of the product, but packaging needs work. four of them ( I ordered 12) were bent upon arrival. Still functional, but bent."
4,Nice surprise.,I knew Eubanks from the Tonight Show intro. but I was pleasantly surprised to hear that he has a smooth jazz style as well. these guitar songs are beautifully composed and played. very impressed.
4,VERY GOOD SOFTWARE,The Software was very helpful when I was creating the origami. The product was easier to make since it was shown in the quick time video on the computer screen. I reccomend this package to anyone who is clumsy like me and needs a visual aid.
1,Disappointment,"I blame myself for failing to realize that these ""1,000"" cards are each less in size then a standard business cards.We hadplanned to use them on a forthcoming month-long trip to Germany and found these not to be practical.Our daughter-in-law, from Regensburg Germany, upon review stated "" they are great for someone who has a casual working of German or English and wants a phrase or word but not of assistance to learn German syntax, sentence structure, etc.,Since having opened the box we have disposed of the product."
3,I can't get myself to use these!,"I always buy these vocab card decks thinking ""yes! i'm going to learn all of these!"" and once they come, I can't get myself to use it. I'll take out a couple and lose them around the house, and then just leave the remaining 990 cards in the box for years until I lose the whole box.The vocabs on them are great, and if you're good about not losing them and reminding yourself to use it, then I think this is a great deck for you.I prefer online/mobile vocab cards. These just didn't work for my study habbit."
4,Unsure how they worked,"I got these for my boyfriend who is taking German 101. He's getting an A in the class, but IDK if there is a direct correlation to these cards, his hard work or a combintion of both."
2,"Idea is great, has grammar errors","Eventhough I like the idea and the concept of these flash cards, I have to give them a negative review. The German language was revised in 2006 and these flash cards have the old spelling. ""Fluss"" is still spelled with the ""s-zet"" just to name one (of many).I send the cards back. They need revision!!!"
4,Really Helpful Memory Aid - Recommended,"These ""German Vocabulary Cards"" are a very helpful way to reinforce German words and their usage. Our son is taking German in school and he wanted these cards to prep at home. While the shear number of words (1000) makes it a little hard to find the current list he is working on for school, we suspect that over time the new ones he learns from using these will nicely augment his class work.The cards are fairly small and slightly thinner than expected, but are good quality and should last a long time.Recommended!CFH"
4,"Very helpful, but could be better","These cards are good, and I'm glad I have them, but they could/should have been better. My main criticisms are:1. They waste far too many cards on obscure words while commonly used words are missing2. The printing should be larger, especially on the back3. The cards are very thin stockAll in all though, they are handy."
2,The cards are too small.,"The card have a wide range of German vocabulary, but the cards are very small and the words are tiny. I am an old man, and I can not see well."
5,My ferrets love this stuff!,My ferrets go crazy for this stuff and it does wonders for their fur and skin. Their fur was getting a bit dull looking. I added this to their daily diet and it has improved greatly! Highly recommend!
5,They go NUTS over this stuff,"i have 3 ferrets. I started with two younger ones and unfortunately we lost one with a recliner accident :( we have since removed the recliner from our home. we adopted two older ferrets from someone on craigs list, I was appalled at the condition these ferrets were in. They had been fed cat food for their entire life and no supplements. when I first held them, they felt boney, nothing like what I was use to. I was afraid of picking them up. i started them on ferret food and supplements, the smallest of the two was so sick, throwing up and diarrhea that I thought we would lose him. After a trip to the vet and continued supplement with pepto, the little guy is now the happiest he's ever been. His body structure is weird, he looks tiny and stiff when he walks BUT he's the fastest of the three, there is no stopping him. He chases the cats and bites our feet. All three of our ferrets LOVE this stuff. They will do anything to get to it. Their fur is so shiny and soft."
5,Ferret Crack,My ferrets love this! I need to keep it in Tupperware just to keep them from trying to open the bottle..
3,Uninspired,"Bluestreak was a 1996 studio album with dedicated personnel including Joe Sample, whose work I loved with the Crusaders. To my surprise, Bluestreak is mundane. Scott plays relatively well, but most of this seems to be formulaic smooth jazz. It's ok, but not really exciting.His Smokin' Section album is much better, as are the Tom Scott and the LA Express albums from the Mid-70's"
1,Disappointed...,"The book doesn't deliver. I was looking for ideas on ""turning my IRA into a fortune"" (it's all relative) through wise tax and investing strategy. The over-hyped Stretch IRA (he is relentless hyping it) ... leaving as much as possible to kids, so they can leave as much as possible to their kids, and after a few generations, voila .... it is a fortune. I don't think I had too high of expectations when I read the description and yes I had heard about Ed as being the IRA expert, so I thought he would deliver the goods (at least a 3-4 star effort). Disappointed. You can get through it in an afternoon though so not too much wasted time."
4,Easy reading....convincing...,This book really shows how important it is to save and how you can turn a 401 that you may not think is a lot into a money stream to span generations. I was hoping it would cover self directed non traditional assets but it doesnt. It is easy reading and could easily save someone from making a major blunder if they read and heed.
4,"Good advice, pitched for a medium level of financial sophistication","Talks about how to structure things like IRAs and trusts to make sure that the money stays in the family. Doesn't go too deeply into financial advice, which would be overtaken by events (quantitative easing and the subsequent screwy behavior of the markets in any case."
4,TO PARLAY OR NOT PARLAY,"Ed Slott is excellent in his field. I find his other books full of good information and alwasy watch when he is on PBS. The book has good informative for leaving your money to your loved ones, but, I wonder if the loved ones will leave the money in the IRA for it to grow or automatically take it out for immediated spending once they inherient it. A lot of people are in extreme debt and would see this as an opportunity to correct some of that debt. The concept is easy to understand, but I was looking for something for those of us who plan to spend every dime before we go. I will keep the book as a reference in case I change my mind.Parlay Your IRA into a Family Fortune: 3 EASY STEPS for creating a lifetime supply of tax-deferred, even tax-free, wealth for you and your family"
3,average with nice head band,a rather dim light that doesnt last very long...the batteries are hard to install and the switch is difficult to find and operate..however it does have an excellent headband
3,There are better headlamps,"I do a lot of night running and lead outdoor expeditions. I bought this head lamp as a cheaper back up to my other head lamps. I did a night run once and the light would start to flick on and off. Which is a bit dangerous when running through the woods. It only has one setting, so there is no power saver mode or blinking mode or any of those other goodies. Also on another run the glass piece that covers the LEDs fell out on trail.It is definitely a lower grade Petzl head lamp and it shows when you use it. If you don't do very rigorous activities with your head lamp then this isn't a bad idea, but if you depend on your lamp for illumination than upgrade."
3,Good for the money,"Not the brightest headlamp I own , good for camping and all your outdoor activities and super cheap and comfortable"
4,Good cheap headlamp,"I like the higher end headlamps better, but this one is good quality for the price overall. The switch seems a bit cheap and I would prefer it to have dimming capability. It is very bright."
1,Cheap,"I will keep this brief.First I never write reviewsSecond This item constantly is falling apart.Its cheap, and poorly constructed don't make the same mistake I made.I should have spent another 10$ for a better head lamp...since it essential for hiking, and the last thing you want is a faulty headlamp.Good luck"
4,Good but consider the 4 lamp model,This one is just fine but I like the 4 lamp version better. It has variable settings and is brighter. Both are great lights and are light enough for my 4 year old to use comfortably.
4,functional,"It has a nice bright light. I use it when I walk my dogs at night, when I'm crawling around in the attic, when I'm doing electrical work and need good close up light. The only thing I wish it had is a plastic cap over the 2 little lights because I'm so careless I'm afraid I'll break the bulbs. Also, I used to have one that I bought at Big Box Orange Logo home improvement store that had the capacity to tilt the light in any direction up or down. I really love that feature and this light doesn't have it. That is why i gave it a 4."
5,great headlamp for the pirce,"was looking for a basic headlamp for my seven year old for a camping trip, and this seemed to be just the thing. has good range. he hds a little trouble finding the sliding on/off switch - a button might be easier - but for this price i was very happy with this purchase."
4,Great help in combination with Book,These cliff notes help explain the content and plot of book. The book is hard to read and grasp.
2,Not your Granny's Desert Rose,"You get what you pay for, I guess. This setting is ""Made in China"" (not England), and is, literally, a pale imitation of my grandmother's Desert Rose dinnerware. The colors seem a lot less vibrant. Granted, it's been 40 years since I last ate off those plates; however, my recollection is that the blooms and vines on the plates and cups were rendered in high relief and boldly painted. On these, the relief is very subtle and the pattern appears to have been printed."
2,Dinnerware,The dinnerset is of a decent quality however it does not match the dishes we already have. The shape and pattern are noticable different from our original peices.
5,"engrossing, useful, insightful!","Beyond discussing Jim Clark (a topic in itself!), this book provides an incredibly good view into the Valley, the Internet, the rise of Internet companies and what they stand to do to conventional business. It makes the excellent point that technology is its own force that repeatedly destroys companies and their markets, because it is ""its own thing"". As some other authors have pointed out, technology moves of its own volition, and Jim Clark is clearly one of its main agents. A must read for any tech afficionado"
4,Very well-written revelation of Silicon Valley ambition,"I have never read Liar's Poker but knew of Lewis' reputation as an investigative maverick who writes with humor and verve. This reputation in all its facets was met. The one thing that I didn't like, however, is that even though Lewis attempted to avoid being overly judgemental about Clark in an apparent attempt to leave such criticism to the reader, his overt awe for Clark is evident in the tone of his prose. This, I think, stultifies the reader's ability to objectively judge the subject."
5,This book is a fantastic read.,"There's no apparent rhyme or reason to the idiosyncratic behavior of Jim Clark, however, whether we understand him or not, he has been instrumental in the shaping of Silicon Valley. Personally, I think there are too many ""safe"" people in the world and Mr. Clark sounds hilariously eccentric... a real risk taker. I think Michael Lewis has done an outstanding job in portraying this man and his many missions in life. Like most people in the world, Jim Clark never seems satisfied with life but unlike most people, he actually does something about it... over and over again. This is a great read and I recommend it highly."
4,Documents Power Shifts from Wall Street to VCs to Ideas,"Great airplane book. The story of Jim Clarke, the only man to have created three billion-dollar ventures-Netscape, Silicon Graphics, and Healtheon. Documents the shifting of power from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, and offers some wonderful insights into the culture. Does not, by virtue of focusing on the one really big success story out of the Valley, begin to address the human waste and carnage from all the failed start-ups."
2,disappointment,"Lewis is a great journalist, and a witty writer, but this is a lazy piece of work. He gets many facts wrong (see the recent Washington Post review for a complete list). Worse, he refuses to pass any judgement on the boorish and greedy Jim Clark. Also, the astounding lack of detail about Clark's personal life - his marriages, his children, etc. - is odd. Did he make a deal with Clark - no personal detail, in exchange for full access to business dealing? If so, Lewis never owns up to it."
1,Weak insight into Silicon Valley....,"I enjoyed Lewis' book ""Liar's Poker"" far more than this one. I grew tired of reading about how selfish, self-absorbed and narcissistic Jim Clark is and wanted to read more about the real stories behind the companies Clark created. The ""Hyperion"" boat plot became something I skimmed through.I think that Lewis would have had a better book if he focused on multiple companies and people. This entire book could be cut down into a chapter around Clark and his antics. I would have liked to have seen other chapters on Cisco, Kleiner-Perkins, Hotmail, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates etc."
1,Disappointing,It sounds like Lewis wants to make sure he pleases Clark with this book and will let him get shares in his next venture at a pre IPO price...
1,A Huge Disappointment,Salomon Brothers was interesting. Jim Clark is boring.Liar's poker was well-written and entertaining. This book muddles through.Do not buy this book. A longer review is not worth my time.
1,Michael Lewis is a racist,I don't take your words kindly when you describe people of other nationalities and colors. I'll make it a point to discourage anyone buying this book or any other wook that you've written or will write.
3,Jim Clark gets a bit old,"An interesting look into the world of Silicon Valley, but very one-sided toward Jim Clark. Although, ater a while, you just don't care about Clark's fantasy of his computer controlled boat, Hyperion. That said, Lewis is a good writer and the book flows well.The discussions of how VCs operate and the culture of Sand Hill Road is fairly interesting.You can read it in a weekend."
1,"A good idea, poorly executed","Like most Silicon Valley ideas, it has a good concept, poorly executed. Horrible writing, poor story-telling make this one of thr worst books I've read in years."
4,"If you like boats, you will love this book.","The book is approximately a 60% discussion of a rich man's boat. If you like boats, and I do, then you will love this book. If you are looking for Silcion Valley insight, then you will get a LITTLE of that too. The book should be titled ""A Rich Man's Boat""."
4,Outstanding insights into this blazingly fast world,"Written like a novel, but with rich insights into the world of the Internet and Jim Clark (SGI, Netscape, Healtheon and now myCFO.com). This is a terrific book (I actually 'read' it on audio book). You realize it's the 'idea' that is really the NEW new thing. Putting that idea into $$$ is what Clark has done over and over again."
3,Not as good as Liars poker,Very well written but gives an insight into Clark's life more than an insight into Silicon Valley. Reads more like a biography and does not capture the wheeling dealing in Silicon Valley whcih the reader might have expected to see.
4,You don't need to know about business to enjoy this,"Lewis writes with great wit and charm. This book takes you to the beginning of Internet stock-market mania, chronicling Jim Clark, an engineer, company founder, and sailing enthusiast who is always focusing on ""the new new thing.""As much as I enjoyed this book, I found that it ran out of steam about three-quarters of the way through. Still, it was lots of fun."
4,Definitely not another Liar's Poker,"Michael Lewis attempts to take on explaining the growth of the Net and the Silicon Valley through the career of Jim Clark, but falls short of expectations. Though lucid and humorous in parts, the overall impact is flat. Focuses too much on the man and not enough on his machines, barring the Hyperion. The book dwells at length on Hyperion to bring out the idiosyncracies of the main protagonist."
2,Where's the beef?,"From what I heard, this is a great book on the industry. But this should have been a magazine essay given the amount of substance that this book had. Sure, The New New Thing can be entertaining, but in the end, there's not much there there."
2,Michael Lewis lets us down,"Two things struck me about this book: 1. The style is so pretentious 2. We really found out very little about Jim Clark.Lewis seems to be so proud of with his own writing style; we keep reading about the ""New New Thing"" and the ""Serious American Businessman"", but in the end find out so little about Clark. Would have been a great short story."
3,"Lewis' style works, but the boat is tiring","Good writing & definitely worth the read (and it is a quick read), but there's far too much focus on Hyperion, Clark's boat. I see Lewis' point here - the boat is such a glaring example of the outrageous and extreme aspects of Clark's personality that it's hard to ignore. But there are just too many pages dedicated to the subject. The passages on the Altantic crossing are especially numbing. I was tempted to just skip the whole thing.It is interesting to see what time has already done to this story...by focusing on Healtheon, Lewis has really chosen the weak sister of Clark's three billion-dollar babies. Indeed, the Healtheon / WebMD story looks shakier by the day. Furthermore, Lewis makes the case that Netscape went public without profits simply because Clark wanted to build his boat. If so, he started a tsunami of no-hope companies down the same road, leading to the dramatic April 2000 market correction."
3,Needs Cynicism,"There are two reasons why Liar's Poker was such a great book. First, it profiled some of the greatest characters of Wall Street during the 1980's. Secondly, Lewis was very critical of Solomon. Reading ""Liar's Poker"" makes you think about how ridiculous traders' views of the world were in the late 1980s.The problem with ""The New New Thing"" is that Michael Lewis is not critical enough of Jim Clark. Jim Clark certainly was generous to Michael Lewis by letting him tag along on so many of his adventures, and it would probably have been inapproriate for Lewis to be more critical of his subject. But, this doesn't make it an interesting book.If you're looking for the ""Liar's Poker"" of the Internet, try Michael Wolf's ""Burn Rate,"" or Po Bronson's ""Nudist on the Late Shift,"" both of which contain much more interesting people, much more information about the internet revolution, and much more cynicisim."
1,A very disappointing book from a great writer,"A very dissappointing, chaotically written book by someone who can write much better. Liars' Poker remains the best, funniest, and most readable book about Wall Street in the 80s. Lewis misses the mark with this book. The plot weaves from the launching of Jim Clark's yacht, to an altogether unsatisfying description of Jim Clark's persona, to more yachting stories, to the creation of Healtheon. The book is really not much more than a collection of ancedotes. It was a quick write I am sure and a quick read as well......maybe Michael should go back to covering politics for The New Republic."
4,Enjoyable yet short...,A very entertaining true story about a very interesting person.By reading this book you will be able to understand the great excitement behind being creative and acting on your visions.
1,canned phrases - rethorical,"Heard this book on tape while driving hundreds of miles towards a broiling turkey of a Thanksgiving dinner. I enjoyed very much the author's earier writings, and was surprised how much I disliked this book. What really irked me were the canned phrases and espressions that are more typical of an inexperienced business writer of a consumer magazine like Business Week. Should I consider this a technology book, I learned very little about the Internet. Should I consider this a character book, the style and caracterization was really really weak."
2,I don't think so,"Jim Clark is god, and Michael Lewis is his prophet. I don't think so, but hey, I'm just a mathematically challenged european.The book gives a comprehensive insight to Jim Clark's achievements. I agree with the author, that this man really rocked the world of the 90s. The facts around this visionary makes the book worth reading.Unfortunately, I can't cope with the style, the book is written in. It's pure encomium of Jim Clark and total condemnation of everyone, who had even only a slightly different view of the world than him (or should I say, than the author?). Believe it or not, it even made me feel sorry for Microsoft on few occasions.Jim Lewis is definitely somebody with an ego even larger than the U.S. health care market. But then, read the book an judge on your own."
4,fun read,"Lewis writes an interesting and easy to read story. It may have been more interesting to people who are involved in the industry, but in any case, Clark's eccentric character and amazing biography make a great story that could be appreciated by anyone."
5,The time is now.,"This book's time is now. To understand what has happened in Silicon Valley, this book is invaluable. A teriffic read. All internet investors must read this book."
2,"Under-, underwhelming","I guess I'm clearly in the minority on this one, but I was frankly unimpressed by this book. For one thing, Clark simply didn't strike me as such a fascinating guy. He may be interesting to the same extent that anyone who makes billions of dollars may be interesting, but no more so. (The guy makes his first billion, and decides he wants a bigger better boat than everyone else. If that's not a cliche, I don't know what is.) In fact, I thought the way he made his money (instant huge wealth based on IPO's of money-losing companies that he may have first thought of but then had little to do with) wasn't even that interesting. I also thought the book lacked a focus and cohesive theme and that all the material about the Hyperion boat--which takes up huge chunks of the book--was kind of dull. I do think that Lewis has a nice writing style and I give him credit for that (I never read Liar's Poker), but I really can't say that I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
4,New New Investment Criteria,"This book illustrates the huge supply of capital and resultant cavalier venture funding of late. One doesn't need a product, or even a business model: just an image and contacts. After the IPO, and the VCs and entrepreneurs have gotten their money out, the public is left with what? Let the buyer (investor) beware.Another disturbing characteristic of this book was the seemingly complete lack of concern for healthcare in the United States. To these folks, it's just another business.I like Michael Lewis' writing and the reminiscence of Tom Wolfe's style, although it's prone to hyperbole, and this can draw attention from more important themes. For example, the most unusual thing about Jim Clarke is not that he plays with model helicopters: It's that he seems to be totally driven by money and power (perhaps not accomplishment?) and that this is considered normal in today's society."
2,Puff piece,I was very disappointed. I was looking forward to something a little bit more hard-hitting than this. I agree with the readers that thought that Lewis seemed to want to please Clark with this book. Makes me wonder whether his access to Clark was only conditional. Oh well... we'll always have Liar's Poker.
4,"Not Lewis's best, but still a great book about Silicon Valley","Reading this book, you get the impression Michael Lewis just moved in with Jim Clark for a year. Sadly, these direct interaction stories and anecdotes are not as compelling as the more standard journalistic backstory: the tale of Clark's rise from abject poverty, the founding of Silicon Graphics and his eventual war with management and the board there, and the story of NetScape. The up to date stuff is less interesting, unless you are really fascinated with big sailboats.If we were rating Lewis books on a scale of 1-5, this would only rate a 3. But since other authors have to also fit into the scale, this gets a 4..."
4,"Very good, but not great","A very good profile of Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics and co-founder of Netscape, written with Michael Lewis's typical verve and good humor. The author's strategy is to stick very closely to Clark, which is good and bad. While Lewis is able to give an interesting character study of the man, he isn't able to give a definitive picture of Silicon Valley in the turbo-charged 1990s. Lewis spends too much time on Clark's computerized boat, and not enough time on the Internet boom that Clark helped launch. Similarly, it would have been nice to see Lewis evince more skepticism about Healtheon, Clark's ill-fated step into online health. This lack of perspective is the big flaw in an otherwise strong and readable narrative. In all, it's an excellent book, but not a masterpiece on par with Lewis's ""Liar's Poker."""
4,Fun Story,"Not nearly as good as Liars Poker, but it seems like Lewis really knows the major trends - bonds in the 80s and tech in the 90s. Wonder what hes working on now..."
5,funny and informative,"this is a very, very good book that is both entertaining and informative. Silicon Valley has turned wall street on it's ear and this book gets the humor, irony and just plain craziness down-pat. Lewis picked the perfect subject to profile in Clark and portrays him objectively, in my opinion. The book is a quick read, and holds the interest of the reader. If you're looking for a light hearted look at the insanity in the valley this is your book. If you're looking for a book about the nuts and bolts of silicon valley this is not the book for you."
4,"Quality read, a little soft on Clark","Lewis writes another entertaining book. Well worth reading. Great snapshot of the Valley. Fairly cutting, especially of VCs and ""old-fashioned"" executives. However, Lewis could have been a little more balanced in his evaluation of Clark. It seems he had to gush about Clark in order to get such wide-ranging access."
4,Excellent and interesting,"Michael Lewis provides a very insightful look into the psyche of Silicon Valley through the eyes of Jim Clark. At times, the details were a bit dry, but Clark's personality combined with Lewis' humor provided for a single sitting read."
2,Needs a New New Editor !,"There are so many editing errors in this book! Misused words (p. 29), confused and grammatically incorrect sentences (pp. 70, 73), stray parentheses (p. 84), to name a few.Ok, these are more a distraction than anything else. What's worse is the lack of substance in this book. The New New Thing is nowhere near as entertaining or enlightening as Liar's Poker. Just page after page of haphazard wonderment at Jim Clark's personality. Not nearly enough depth about the companies he created."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially after such rave reviews from the New York Times etc. The book starts out slow and then continues to dribble on. The story is as much about Michael Lewis as it is about Jim Clark. The boat story is dragged on way too long, and what is the message? Maybe I just missed the point, but there appears not to be one. So, Jim Clark was successful and a cowboy. If that is it, then this should have been a good story in a magazine. It is too much of the same thing said over and over again. I really had hoped I would enjoy this book."
2,an exciting life made boring,"Jim Clark is charismatic ! Jim Clark is a genius ! Jim Clark is a megalomaniac ! This should make for a fascinating read, but the author is a smart-alec who in trying to be humorous trivializes most every incident in the story. Why so much text ( 2 chapters plus other minor parts ) should be spent describing how Clark vaporizes millions on his toy- the yacht with the world's tallest mast - and the endless details of its misbegotten trans Atlantic trip is beyond me. So boring I had to force myself to finish it. A much more interesting and palatable overview of Clark, in the perspective of all the other geniuses in the Valley is presented in The Silicon Boys."
2,This book is over-hyped,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is completely lacking insight into the world of high tech. My impression is that Michael Lewis had enjoyed hanging out with a very rich man and needed to write up something, anything, to sort of justify the time he had wasted and so he just strung some pointless, not very interesting anecdotes together. I feel that I have been had. It really is a rather rubbishy book."
2,Not far enough,"Although entertaining, I felt Lewis was superficial in his story. At the end, Clark is enigmatic -- still and at the very least, pitifiul. The book also suffered from inadequate editing. How many times did we need to told and retold that Clark was different? I think after the first three times, the average dolt reader (i.e., me) might well get it. After the twentieth time, I was annoyed. Also various factual errors that I knew about made me question how many more there were. For example, Microsoft is NOT the largest market cap company on the NYSE; it doesn't trade on the NYSE; it trades on NASDAQ. Wardman, Microsoft's chief lawyer did NOT go to Harvard Law; he went to UVA Law. I wondered what other errors there were that I missed."
2,Lewis's Version of Internet IPO,"I was really expecting to like this a lot. Although I enjoyed parts of the book, it is not 1/100th as good as Liar's Poker. I don't know much more about Jim Clark than before I started reading the book. I found the details about the Hyperion boring. Still other parts are mildly entertaining. If you haven't read Po Broson's First $20M is Always the Hardest Part don't waste your time on this. I hate to get caught on details, but indicating Microsoft as an NYSE company was an enormous loss of credibility for me. Lewis' IPO, easy money for him, not much for the benefit of the reader."
1,A Deification of Jim Clark,"I just put this book down, and I'm somewhat dissapointed that I put aside other books to devote time to this one. For the most part this book, in a long drawn out way, deifies Jim Clark and his bold, brash personality, an undertaking I don't feel the need to observe. The book offers only a superficial view of the workings of Silicon Valley and its response to new products, and offers no insight into the specific workings of any of the nascent corporations. All in all I walked away from this book disappointed, and with little to no increase in my Internet education."
3,Worth a Listen,"I thought about it, and really I think Jim is a great guy and a has a lot of brainpower."
3,The panic pursuit of happiness,"It is an astounding tale on many levels. First- how could anybody read this book and not come away thinking that Jim Clark is a complete fool? This man let an ego-book about his life be written which gives him the attention span of a toddler. Then the author has the gall to tells us that Jim likes it so much that he/we will all be invited along for the next episode. Now we are expected to believe that this man is a ""True Hero Of The Internet Economy""- all because he wanted many millions to build a bigger yacht.As one who has been in the software business as well as an offshore sailor, I find every chapter to be filled with the most incredulous disregard for Planning Ahead. Jim Clark has had more good luck in one week than most us will have in a lifetime. I found the descriptions of many events to be light on facts, so don't go looking for many details here. It is a very light read- on par with the attention span of it's subject."
2,Very disappointing treatment of a fascinating subject,"The writer has a very annoying way of not describing the people and places he's talking about very well. You come away not really knowing what the main character looks like, what the house or boat look like, etc. And the author makes a lot of ""cute"" comments which fall flat."
3,Found Wanting,I read on my Kindle and as an immobile person I read a lot and fast. As a result unless the book is really good it doesn't stay with me.Unfortunately this book falls into that category. Unremarkable!Betty
5,Outstanding! Can't get over it...,"I can't get over how much I adore this book. Joyce Lamb, you have yourself a new fan....I will buy any book with your name on it if they're half as emotional and suspenseful as this one! I enjoyed the characters immensely...it was nice to read about a strong heroine. At times, I honestly felt like crying for her and the situation. It takes a lot for a book to make me want to cry. There was just so much suspense and emotion and power in this one novel.I got this when it was a freebie. It's up to .99 cents now, but I would still HIGHLY recommend it, as it's one of the best novels I've ever read. Check it out!!"
4,Intriguing and action packed,This was my first Joyce Lamb novel and it captivated me to the point I bought the rest of her books. Unconventional story line with believable characters and a happy ending always makes for a good read.
4,The best Amazon deal.,This book was very good. I was interested right off the bat. She really has good story lines that makes you sad when the book is over. Will be reading another one of hers that I purchased on Amazon.
3,"Introduction excellent. After the introduction, too much narrative.","The introduction was excellent, which developed the characters well. Too much narrative and too much unnecessary detail took my focus away from the main story which allowed me to see the words on the page, rather than being in there with the action. The ending was, like most dramatic stories, a little unrealistic. Notwithstanding the above, I enjoyed the plot and am pleased I purchased the book."
4,Good Product,"This mag pouch would be rated higher if it stayed in place, it has the tendency to ride either left or right of placement?"
1,Not universal,I Have 9mm double stacks.They fit extremely loose in this holster. They fall out when practicing drills. Don't buy if you want to keep you mags.
5,Excellent introduction to blood,"I read the 3rd edition of Dailey's Notes on Blood. The book purports to ""offer the layperson and professional a simple way to learn or review the basics of blood physiology, immunology, and related topics."" It has done so exceedingly well and the reader is likely to feel that he has gained useful knowledge almost effortlessly. If you are interested to know more about the basics of blood and its components, whether for personal or professional reasons, you are unlikely to find a book that will surpass Dailey's."
3,Maybe too irresistible,to be believable. I couldn't buy it that all these men could not resist this woman. The plot was also a little tired but it had an interesting angle on how the woman got onto the men.
3,French Fields,"I have enjoyed the original Fresh Fields many times--it is well written and the actors and actresses seem perfect for their parts. I was lookijg forward to French Fields, but it is not nearly up the standard of the original series."
1,"Highly Unpractical, Only Good If You Already Know It",If you are an expert in XPath then this book might be worth having. But if you only have a general knowledge of XPath this book is basically useless. The author clearly has a solid knowledge of his topic. But the ability to communicate it in a practical way is sorely lacking.
3,Good information for teens and adults,"This book provides an understanding of spirituality in many cultures and allows the reader to see not only the differences, but more imortantly, the similarities."
5,Perfect for sharing a unity perspective,I believe there is many paths to one G-d. How to express that belief to my young teens in a world that wants to slot-file every believer into one category is difficult. This book shares some of the beauty of all the major classic religions in a way that is fully accessible to teens and adolescents. It is a younger persons version of Houston Smith's World Religions.
4,Works great as a belt-style case,"This case is a good compromise between a small case that may only hold your camera and a big case that will hold your camera and all its accessories. There are two small side pockets that can hold an extra tape and battery. There is also extra depth in the main compartment, but there is no divider so you would need to improvise with the storage space.This case was very useful for keeping my camera near by while walking through Carlsbad Caverns and hiking the Grand Canyon. I don't like the idea of a shoulder case (always in the way) or backpack case (to difficult to reach the camera).This case is more for staying mobile. You'll need someplace else to store your charger, adapters, cables, etc.PROs: Stays secure around your waist, and provides easy access to camera.CONs: Could have thicker padding, and dividers for main compartment."
2,"good construction, bad design","At the time I bought this case I couldn't find any pictures of it other than from manufacture. But even CaseLogic didn't have good pictures for this case. Just one picture from outside. No inside pictures at all.This case has no dividers inside at all. just one open space in the middle and the same in the side pockets. No netting pockets as well.In addition to the bad design this case is not soft inside. All inside surface is made of the nilon like umbrella so anything you put in it will slide all around the case. Even you cannot use divider from another(older) case because welcro will not stick to nilon.May be construction of this case is good, but design is very poor."
4,1001 MCSE Tips is a great starting point!,"This book was written for those of you who know you want a career with the Microsoft product, but don't know just how to get started. It contains information on where to look for study help, how to find evaluation copies of server 4, what you need to be prepared to test, and much more. I wouldn't rely solely on this book to pass the core exams, but it is a great place to start."
1,Warning,"This version is not the special edition that the other reviews are discussing. THAT one is OOP and costs quite a bit.This is the old TV print, with all of the vampire action cut out and terrible print quality. Do NOT waste your money.Amazon has done its old idiotic trick of porting the same reviews to different editions of things, so this review shows up under the Special Edition and the DVD on demand Amazon does, which is the garbage I refer to in my review. If the title doesn't say Night Of The Sorcerers: SPECIAL EDITION, stay away! It's likely to be the bad old degenerated print w/cuts ."
5,I know it will be great!,"I actually came to this sight looking for the Barefoot Ballet record..or hoping it had been released on CD) and I found this, which also has Barefoot Ballet on it. Klemmer's music holds so many memories for me..I listened to it incessitantly in the 70's! It evokes such powerful feelings that mere words cannot describe. I am Janice from California (relocated to Sharpsburg, GA)..e-mail me at jgabr92262@aol.com if you have Klemmer memories to share!"
5,FABULOUS!,"I was in high school when i started hearing John Klemmeron the radio! Being a jazzaholic,i was totally mesmerizedby his dreamy tunes.As i got a little older, this was the perfectmusic for driving up the california coast! Memories! I'dagree with the other critc that this is baby-making music forsure VERY SEXY! Every song is just wonderful! I totally recommend this CDto everyone who enjoys jazz,or who is starting to get into it!!!"
2,NOT THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL MCA ALBUM,MCA released this compilation in 1979 as a 2 LP set with 17 tracks. The CD version has been shortened so as to fit on one CD and several songs deleted while adding others that would fit. Those looking to replace their vinyl copies beware. This is a rip off.
3,Sony Clock Radio,"This little radio does the job in my extra bedroom. I think the controls on top could have been made more easily seen by someone who needs glasses and doesn't wear them to bed. The all white finish needs the tiny letters to have black inside so they can be seen without getting up and turning the whole clock sideways in the glare to see what to push. Very irritating. The radio reception is not so good either. Antennae is lacking, but when you're sleeping, who cares. The clock numerals are nice and big. That's a plus!"
3,Sony clock radio,The size of the radio is much larger than I expected. It takes up too much room on my night stand. I was looking for clock radio that was easy to use as was my previous one which unfortunately broke. This one has settings and instructions too complicated to bother with.
1,Sony ICF-C218 Automatic Time Set Clock Radio (White),The Finnish electric network is different from U.S. I could not make it work so it is out of order.
3,clock review,The sound quality of this radio is sabout as poor as could be imagined. It sonds like the speaker is a tin can.
4,Great clock for the price.,"Simple and good looking clock for the bedside. Got 2 of them, one for my son's room, he loves it. Good price."
5,Great Clock Radio,"This is a great little clock radio. We have three of them and I would highly recommend it. Simple to use and if you loose power, the time stays correct."
1,"Not automatic, factory pre-set time.","This clock does not set the time automatically. This clock is factory pre-set to the correct time. ""Automatic Time Set"" should be replaced with ""Factory Time Set"".This means that any clock that relies on the wall outlet power to provide a 60Hz frequency (as is done in the USA, but not Europe and elsewhere).If you want to avoid this, you need to find a clock that use the NIST WWVB radio station signals to set them (often advertised as ""atomic"", even though the clock itself isn't maintained by an atomic clock, but the radio source is). They are more expensive than your average clock, and the cheapest I've seen is around $40. A full list of manufacturers can be found at the NIST website (hint: Sony is not listed)."
4,Sony clock,"Perfect for a bedroom, and easy to read the time. no need to change time, auto settings for day light savings.value for money."
1,Could not find radio stations,"I have many radios, including two clock radios, around the house. This is the only one that could not find my favorite stations. It would pick up some stations with a very scratchy, muddy sound and then not be able to find them the next day.I had an old Sony Dream Machine that worked very well for years. I was hoping to replace it with a new one but this one is awful."
2,Radio won't turn off,"I bought and returned this clock about a month ago, and decided to review today when I saw that many other people had the same issue I did: the radio will not turn off. No matter what you do. The ""Radio Off"" button simply does not work. You can turn the volume way down, but you cannot turn the radio off.How is it that they keep shipping out this defective clock? Is it a batch of clocks that were defectively made? Or are they just fiddling with the same clock and shipping it out to the next customer? Whatever it is, it does not look good. Please test and get rid of the defective clocks!"
5,Great little alarm clock,"This is a great little clock. It is difficult to understand directions of how to set. Not an easy task. We are still working on that. However it plays nice and I am sure once we figure it out it will be a ""piece of cake"""
3,As expected,"Auto setting the time is nice, uses a disc battery vs a traditional 9v, which is not a big deal. Radio signals were coming in weak, I would have appreciated a stronger tuner to actually let you listen to the radio."
3,It's getting faster and faster!,"I'm generally satisfied with the functions and features this small alarm clock provides.But the problem is that, I only used it for one week, and it's already 4 minutes faster than it was last weekend!Maybe I'm wrong, but is there a resolution?"
3,Not an atomic clock,"As pointed out by other reviewers, this clock is not set automatically by a radio signal from an atomic clock. The designation ""automatic time set"" is misleading, as in this case it simply refers to automatic adjustments for daylight saving time (DST), made possible by a built-in calendar. While this is a helpful feature, it is not the same thing as ""automatic time set"". The time has been set at the factory and the time is maintained by a backup battery until you plug in the unit. The time was off by 3 minutes in my case, so I immediately had to set the time zone and time manually."
3,Don't be fooled. This NOT AN ATOMIC CLOCK!!,"Although this product hits an Amazon product search for atomic (i.e. radio controlled) clocks, THIS PRODUCT IS _NOT_ AN ATOMIC CLOCK.It simply has an internal calendar that automatically adjusts daylight saving time according to the date and time that YOU MANUALLY SET. This product DOES NOT set date and time automatically by itself.Despite the misleading feature description, it does its job overall. An internal battery backs up time ticking so that you won't have to re-adjust the clock after a power outage. I have installed the product in our family AV room where we usually watch TV in a dark ambient and we still can read time from the moderately lit green LED. The radio feature is useless to me."
4,good product,I use this product in the bathroom for listening to Radio and keep track of time. It serves my purpose pretty well.. The Auto time-set feature sets the time automatically. So I don't need to bother about unplugging the radio and re-plugging it.
4,Great Product - Low Price,When I got this clock radio I was shopping for Brand and Price. I had another Sony alarm clock/radio for many years that finally died and was looking for a no fuss replacement. Did not even notice that it had the Automatic Time Set feature. I plugged in the clock and the time appeared like magic. Very cool. Easy to use the alarm set feature. Can't beat the price.
3,"Nice, but didn't work out for us.","I wanted to like this more, but my wife hated it. The alarm was not loud enough for her, and this morning she managed to hit snooze for 40 minutes at one go."
3,My 10 year old twins sleep through the alarm!!!,"I kept having a problem with my 10 year olds forgetting to set their alarms at night or forgetting to reset the clock after an electrical 'hiccup'. Anyway, I bought them each one of these clocks so they'd never have to fuss with the time again. Let me say that part works GREAT! However, they both like to fall asleep listening to music which they have on a very low volume. The 'sleep' feature allows them to set the timer to 90/60/30/0 minutes till shut-off. Since they fall asleep to a low volume music, they are not able to set the wake-up alarm to 'radio'. They'd never hear it. So we set it to 'buzzer'. The sound is not a buzzer. It's a very pleasant beeping which is not that loud at all. If you wake easily this should not be a problem. My two DON'T wake easily. I still find myself having to wake them up. My next move... a foghorn blown from the sofa where I sit drinking my morning joe and watching the news. :)"
5,Just right,"This is just right for what it is....it works just fine, does what it is supposed to do. Sound is fine for casual back ground music and talk radio. Not a replacement for a Bose system or anything like that, but quiet acceptable at a very reasonable price."
5,"Great little clock/radio, good value","These are great, they have a small ""footprint"", nice big easy to read numbers and I like the alarm reset button which allows you to turn it off for today but still keep it set for tomorrow."
3,"Nice alarm clock, but needlessly large!!","Got this for my wife ... when we took it out of the box, we were both rather stunned at how large the clock is - nearly 3x larger than her current clock?! Overall she's happy with it, so we're going to keep it ... but really, I can't see why the clock would have to be sooo large (takes up ~20% of the top of her nightstand, and it's not a small nightstand!)"
2,Unfortunately,Unfortunately it doesn't work with 220 volt. In my city we haven't 110 volt. I was don't know and I plug it in 220 volt and its burnt out.Sorry about my bad English
5,Great for my middle aged school kids,My girls loved this alarm clock. Before purchasing it we were in a constant battle for them to getup on time. They love the fact that they can wake up to some music in the morning.The price for the product is great and the quality is outstanding.
4,Excellent,I bought this back in December because I needed a new alarm clock. My thoughts on it so far...Pros:-Excellent delivery time. It actually came a day early!-Stylish. This alarm clock goes with just about any type of decor.-The alarm on this is loud enough to wake you up but not so loud that it hurts your ears.Cons:-Setting the time and alarm on this was kind of confusing. I wish they had made the controls more straight-forward.
4,Good clock radio,Bought 2 of these for my daughters. They are easy to use and my 8yr old doesn't have any problems setting her own alarm during the school days. Very basic but wish it had a Mon-Fri alarm option. This clock I so easy to use and relatively inexpensive that I just bought 3 more for our vacation condo.
1,don't buy this radio,"Could not, with repeated tries, get the time set...nor would the radio itself work when turned on. Total waste of money."
2,Way to bright,"This clock radio looks nice, but is a little big on a night stand. The auto time is nice although it is not that hard to set other alarm clocks by hand. But none of these are a big deal. The big problem is that the clock is WAY, WAY to bright. I sleep in a 12'x12' room and at night it lights up half the room, it is way stupid that they did not test this and at least include a dimmer switch. Have to return."
2,can't connect with computer,"It's my first time heard a digital recorder can't connect with computer,it is very strange.I think it's not fit for me."
3,Olympus VN2100 Voice Recorder,This product is very compact and easy to operateHOWEVER: it only records clearly at short distances. If you are going to use this for reminders and memos you should be very pleased. If you plan to record meetings and discussions which will take place in open rooms and at distances over 3-4 feet.... don't bother you WILL be disappointed!!!!
4,Well playd!,"The reason that i rated this 4 stars is that i love high notes and screaming! This is not a high note record but its still great! It reminds me a lot of his record from 92""I remember Clifford""!Its a lot of standard songs here like;Moontrane,Mack the knife,A moments notice and Dizzys atmosphere!He also play some of his own songs here! the record is really great for jazz fans but not for high note lovers!"
2,Uninspired,"The musicians are great, but this album is really flat. Ironically, this music just doesn't swing. The solos are technically good, but the solo melodies are not particularly interesting. I found myself skipping to the next song on the album after the head. Fast and high just is not enough. There are many other much better bebop artists and albums out there. Look for something better."
5,Arrived today in perfect conditions,"Dear sirs,I have just received the CD The Conversation in perfect condition and before the estimated date of delivery. Thank you very much."
3,Meh...,"For the price, it was an okay buy... but it was SOOO incredibly thin, I would never have paid full price. It's one of the thinnest fleece blankets I've ever bought. The Disney character ones at Target or Wal-mart for around $12-$14 are MUCH better quality and much thicker."
1,Scansoft ignores the Mac Platform.,"I bought this software when it first came out 2 years ago to use with OS X. Since buying it Scansoft has not released one update or bug fix for the program. It will not work with any Photoshop plugins in OS X. I have tried to get it to work with my Canon Lide 30 scanner with no success whatsoever.You would think when you buy an expensive software program you would at least get free email support. No way with Scansoft! Their philosophy is to milk their customers for as much as they can get, charging $20 for each support question by email.If you need to buy an OCR program for your Mac I would highly recommend buying Readiris instead. Although far from a perfect program, it puts OmniPage to shame. Unlike Scansoft they do provide free email support. Readiris is also very good at preserving the format of a document when translated into Word Processing and Text Editing programs. This is something that OmniPage fails miserably at."
1,It's not fully MAC OS X compatable,"This version is not 100% Mac OS X compatable. You have to switch to ""Classic"" mode to scan a document directly into OmniPage Pro X. No where on the box or in the directions does it tell you this. I found out after using my ONE free technical support call. The Mac OS 8/9 version works the way its supposed to.I wasted my money."
1,More like a Downgrade,"If you have owned previous versions of OmniPage for the Mac, you will be very disappointed in this one. Previous features have been lost in this version, such as the ability to batch process a folder of tiffs. If you draw your own zone templates, it will not automatically batch process the file. It asks you if you would like to use this zone or another zone for every single page forcing you to hit a return. The number of scanners it will work with is very limited. Maybe on a PC its better, but we are going back to using an old version on a classic machine for now."
3,It works fine in OS X for me.,"Just wanted to clear up some misinformation. I installed Omnipage Pro X in OS X 10.4 (Tiger). I did not need to use ""Classic"" to install it, nor to do any scanning. My scanner is a Canon LiDE 35, which has an OS X TWAIN driver. So everything is fully OS X compatible."
1,Thanks for the reviews,"Just a quick thank-you to the others who have written. I was set to buy the upgrade, assuming that 'Pro X' meant OS X compatible. Thanks for saving me $130, and turning me on to Readiris - actual OS X software."
2,Dosage Calculations,"This item came in the mail very quickly, but it could have been much better priced ($76). There was not that much availablility at my time of purchase. What also upsetted me was that I bought this item NEW and there was some damage on the front cover when I recieved it. Otherwise, the book and the cd were intact and in good condition."
3,"Strong on Ripley, weak on Brook Farm","Brook Farm, a 'utopian' community in West Roxbury Massachusetts founded in 1841, has long interested me because the principles it was founded on were so wise and the setting so idyllic. This history of Brook Farm was an interesting read, particularly strong on George Ripley and his wife and how Brook Farm came about. But I thought there was too much emphasis on Ripley's involvements outside of Brook Farm and after almost 400 pages I still had a lot of questions on how the community actually operated"
5,Positively the best book on Brook Farm,"This book is positively the best book on the Brook Farm community. Scholarly and authoritiative, but very interesting and accessible for the general reader, the book offers many new insights into the Brook Farm community."
2,place setting desert rose,I ordered this place setting to add to the franciscan desert rose dishes that I already have ( from England). These poor quality dishes were made in Taiwan and were a different color and the flowers were not the same!!! I would never buy from Amazon again to match a set!!!!
3,Decent Fixture or the price,Decent fixture for the price when compared to the other RLM fixtures available. The plastic strain relief does not hold securely and will require a bit of tinkering or you'll find your light slipping down and dangling from the wirenuts.
4,WDB2,I put 4ea lights in a newly constructed 30'W X 40'L X 14'H work shop that has no windows but does have 4 translucent panels. The lights were more than sufficient for normal work but doesn't negate the need for additional light in confined space.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HM5LQE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,"Looks good, plastic parts fail",This is a nice fixture and I'm happy with the overall looks and function. The only complaint that I have are the plastic clamp bolts break and will not hold the cord in place. Had to make a bushing using several layers of electrical take to hold the cord in the fixture where I wanted.
5,Light,Product got here fast and was just as advertised. I love them. They were a great finishing touch to my office.
5,To Timbuktu,I read this book by Mark Jenkins first and was so impressed with his writing that I immediately bought his book on Bicycling to Siberia. This was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone at all interested in adventurous and unusual travel.
4,Couldn't put it down!!,"Mark is a fantastic writer! I'd read anything written by him. This book is an absolute page turner. I felt like I was there! Besides being extremely entertaining, it's also insightful, educational, and incredibly poignant. If you like adventure travel books, you will love this. Highly recommended!!"
2,Didn't do much for me,I have several of the Leslie Sansone walking tapes and think she's much better. Maybe I am not the target audience but didn't inspire me very much. I think it is definitely for a beginner.
5,Remarkable Insight into a Pueblo,"Dozier provides an ethnography meant for students of anthropology, but his inside view of a Pueblo is a rare event, given that only a few pueblo Indians have become social scienists. He no doubt kept secret much of what elders thought should be secret, but he gives us a lively account of everyday life and something of ritual, political, and religious life.He has a similar ethnography for the Tewa of Hopi Pueblos. Plainly written, extensive coverage and the best we can hope for as an inside view of the Pueblos."
4,Good overview of period,General infoStill pretty good read though for those interested in Pueblo Indians
4,Great speakers,4.5 starsI like these very much - they sit in my living room (I got the beech color from the scratch and dent part of the axiom website).I also have some Ascend cbm 170s - comparable in price for their black plastic finish. The Ascends are a little better in sound - but you will pay more to get a nice finish.All told - nice speakers. Some people will say that the Energy C3s are better than these Axioms. Some people like the Axioms better than the Ascends. I think the Ascends are slightly better than the Axioms (I haven't heard the Energy speakers) but the Axiom reputation is a lot of speaker for the money.A great buy.
2,Not what I expected,Very disappointed that the maps were missing from the book. I will have to reorder. I will also look into gps giudes.
4,Hiking New Hampshire,"A great hiking guide to New Hampshire, detailed maps and trail information. Top Notch!"
5,All-Clad 10.5 inch saute pan,This is a very nice pan for the price. I use it to carmelize sugar for use in a flan recipe.
1,most of the transfers are so bad you can't watch them,"this one really left me cold. i own a lot of these 10and 20 pack movies and like them. so i don't expect great prints,but i do think that you should be able to watch them and these are not watchable. you can get these movies in other collections and i would pass this one up."
5,great accessory,I purchased a few of the changing pad covers for my Starlight collection. Its a fun way to switch things up and I always have one on hand when the other gets dirty. I recommend buying at least 2 changing pad covers.
4,"Hello, Little Mouse",This book is wonderful. I've been reading this book with my 3.5 year old since he was 2. I start the book and he reads the next page for me. We talk about what the mouse is doing and pretend to eat the strawberry. Great fun!! I wish the book was longer. A definite must have for your library.
5,Hello Little Mouse. What Are You Doing?,"What's a little, strawberry loving mouse going to do to keep a big, hungry, strawberry loving bear from eating his fruit? Especially when ""the big, hungry Bear can smell a red, ripe strawberry a mile away..."" Well, with a little clever help from the reader, this turns out to be an easy problem to solve..... Don and Audrey Wood have authored an entertaining, interactive treasure that's sure to charm and delight kids from 1 to 91. Their simple text is joyous and engaging, But this is really a story told through the marvelous illustrations. Mr Wood's bold, bright, and amusing artwork stars a most endearing little furry friend, and youngsters will love all the captivating facial expressions and wonderful, humorous detail in each two page spread. The Little Mouse, The Red Ripe Strawberry, And The Big Hungry Bear is a masterpiece little ones will beg to read again and again, and a timeless classic to share with friends, family, and future generations."
4,Good little book,"This book is written in the form of a narrator talking directly to the main character, the little mouse. (Spoiler alert - there probably isn't really a bear.)Very cute, very simple - each page has only one or two lines on it - and some clever illustrations (one one page, the mouse disguises his strawberry in a pair of fake glasses with a nose).Only thing is that this book has been abridged slightly. The non-board book versions have a few illustrations that were left out of this version, and some of the two-page spreads in the other versions were cut down into one page in this version, making a few pages look a little choppy. Also, the last page of the book has become this book's back cover and blurb.It doesn't ruin the book, or make it close to unreadable, but if I had to do it again I'd just buy the longer version to start with."
4,Beautiful Pictures,"I really think people are a bit too sensitive. This book uses imagination. I guarantee kids aren't thinking about being sneaky when reading this book. If you are worried about, then it is great conversation starter. The pictures are beautifully done and there are so many directions you can go in with this book! This book reminds me of childhood!"
3,Adorable story and illustrations but....,"My 4-month old daughter doesn't stick with this one from beginning to end as well as she does some other books we have. I think I like it more than she does! She does enjoy it when I read about the bear SNIFFING out the strawberry. The story allows me to get pretty animated with my voice so that does help keep her in it a little bit better. To give the book a little more credit, I think she is more interested in chewing on it right now than listening to a story so she will probably like it a lot more when she can understand it!"
1,Rather Scary and Tricky for a young child,"Yes, this book has cute illustrations, but lots of them are showing the mouse's fear about the big hungry bear. You never see this bear, rather it is a narrative convention...the narrator suggests that there is a big hungry bear lurking who loves strawberries, so the mouse, shaking like a leaf tries to hurry and harvest the berry and hide it. But the narrator then tells him he can't hide it from the bear and the ONLY way to basically save himself is to half the berry and share it.I don't like the premise of this book, which is about using trickery (and outright lies) to get your way. The narrator (who we see is another mouse at the end) could have just asked for some berry. Or the main mouse could have just offered some. But from the start, the narrating mouse just scares him into sharing. Not the lesson I want to teach. I am returning my copy. I do not recommend, at least not for young children."
1,Horrible,"This a great book if you want to teach your child about deceit, greed, paranoia, passive-aggression and fear."
1,Bullying and fear tactics,"The pictures are beautiful.The storyline is awful.It is entirely about intimidating the mouse into sharing the strawberry he picked. The 'big hungry bear' is simply a tool being used to manipulate the mouse. The narrator doesn't even TRY to get the mouse to share the strawberry, he leaps right into lies and manipulation.We want to get rid of the book, but hesitate to even give it away - we'll wait till we are near a fireplace and burn it. No child should be exposed to this sort of thing. The only possible value for this book is if it is used to help them talk about some adult in their life who has been pressuring them and manipulating them. Read it to them, and say ""Do you have anyone in your life like the narrator?"""
4,A Great Book and the kids ask for it again and again!,My kids ask for it again and again...It looks and sounds like a lasting classic. The pics could be more colorful ..but like I said it looks like a classic and the kids obviously dont care. It is a great funny story. should be part of your collection
5,It's the Bear!,"As a Grandma, I've bought this book more than once for different grandchildren. It's an all-time favorite of mine! But the reviews I'm reading say the reader is the narrator. Nope. It's the Big Hungry Bear who is leading the mouse to share the strawberry! Since I've bought different editions, I've seen that not all of them show the shadow of the bear on the last page. When we read this story, we are the voice of the Big Hungry Bear!"
2,Better for 2 year olds than for 4-8 year olds (as advertised),"I have a 2-1/2 year old daughter who enjoys complicated story lines, so I bought this book because it is listed as appropriate for ages 4-8. A 4-year old would be too old for this book (never mind an 8-year old!). It's a somewhat cute story and it has great illustrations, but it's very basic book with few words and a very simple plot. Also, the message is about being devious (tricking the mouse to share its strawberry), when it would more appropriately teach the concept of sharing."
5,A wonderful read that spans generations!,I remember this book when I was a child and now I get to share it with my daughter! Beautiful illustrations and an easy read!
5,What a WONDERFUL book!,"This absolutely delightful book can be read to two year olds, but six year olds don't tire of it either. The pictures are enthralling, the story line is engaging, and youngsters can enjoy it on many different levels. Luckily, this is a book you'll enjoy reading again ... and again ... and again ... and ..., because I guarantee you will be asked to."
3,Mixed feelings on this one,"While in general I think this is a cute book my children did not care for it. I just don't think children can ""get it"" at too early of an age. I also didn't like the scary/fear part of the storyline for this age group. Not one of our favorites."
3,Great book but order right size!,"Great book for preschool ages, just make sure you order the right size. I thought I was ordering a regular book, but this one (for around $27) is GIANT. It's like 2 1/2 feet by 2 1/2 feet. I didn't see that clearly listed in the description; I just typed in a search for this title and this was the first one to come up so I ordered it. I later found a regular size is also available through Amazon I think it was listed for around $10."
4,"Great book, but too small","I bought this book the first time in 1983 for my son. He loved it! Only then it was a much larger board book. Now I wanted to get it for my first grandchild, and was disappointed that it is so small. I probably should have paid closer attention to the dimensions."
5,A delightful story but the board book is abridged,"They have this book at my daughter's preschool and the director of the school loves to read it to her pre-K class. The director is amazing, changing her voice as she reads. My daughter started saying some quotes from the book to her younger brother. So cute! I bought the book to have at home and got the board book hoping it would be sturdier with two little ones. I was disappointed to discover that the board book is abridged and the quotes my daughter says are not in there. I will keep it for my younger son but will be buying the regular book to keep for my daughter's library."
5,fovever favorite book,"I have had this book since I was little and it has never stopped being one of my absolute favorite books. I just love the suspense that the narrarator gives to the little mouse, along with the beautiful artwork. Not to mention that I too love red ripe strawberries."
5,a sweet little book,"this is the board book, but this is better in large picture. The characterizations are so vivid. I'm afraid of that hungry bear too, but then I realize that I'm the bear. oh how silly. and we laugh EVERY time we read it. This is the book you keep forever and buy for gifts so that you don't have to share yours."
5,Very enjoyable book to read with your toddler!,Higly recommend to read with your toddler-absolutely wonderful illustrations! What a cute story!!!!!
3,First Iles book I have read: Please answer a nagging question..,"Do all of his books have so much product placement or is this a new thing? The 1st time he mentioned Wal Mart raised my eyebrow (being a huge reader of a wide variety of books this is the first I have seen/noticed product placement within one) However by the 6-7th mention of that store (just inserting it where ever...""To the left of the Super-Wal Mart....on the right side of the road"") I knew he wasn't just pointing out that Mississippi is littered with those stores that he is doing product placement. (I'm a regular visitor to that area of MS). And this doesn't touch on all the OTHER product placements from computers to phones to brands of cola. Either you are a marketer Greg Iles or an author. Don't ruin your reputation by becoming the former out of sheer greed.Product placement turned me off. The premise of the story was fine but the book never truly delivered on ""True Evil"" -- no one frightened me, not even Dr Tarver."
1,Simply Awful,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is tedious, unbelievable and after a third of the book, I went straight to the end with no satisfaction. If you are interested in a believable mystery and characters, this is not your book. Just terrible!"
2,disappointing,"It saddens me to say that I thought ""True Evil"" was a disappointing book. I absolutely loved ""Third Degree"" so I had very high expectations when it came to reading this book.The main character (Alex Morse) is not very believable. It seemed a little bit too far fetched that she was faced with some much tragedy in her past as well as her current life but yet still managed to be such a great crime solver. This aspect kinda reminded me of ""Step on a Crack"" by James Patterson. I didn't like that one either.Nevertheless, it was a good concept but I think that Gregory needed to do some more rewriting to make this book more palpable. It's definitely not a book that I would recommend.Since I find some of Gregory's writing style to be similar to James Patterson, if you're looking for a real page turner, read ""The Quickie"" by James Patterson. I promise you won't be disappointed."
5,Best Iles to date!,"This is the best Iles book to date - a detailed thriller not a 3-day treadmill read (like recent James Patterson). As a healthcare professional, I think the author handled a medical topic fairly well. Although he obviously does not have a medical background, his research was thorough. The book was also very suspenseful; I was up late reading it for at least 3 nights. Iles deserves to be recognized - right up there with Baldacci and Grisham."
3,Not as good as his first books,"When I read Phoenix Rising, I was hooked on Greg Isles. I then went on to read Turning Angel as well as a few others and loved them all. This particular book did not grab like his other books, but I cannot put my finger on why - was it the characters or the story line? I really don't know. I would still recommend reading."
5,great book,"good read all the way to the end, lots of suspense and unexpected turns, this book will not let you down"
4,When will they be making a movie?! Fantastic.,"This is one of the most intelligent and entertaining reads I have had in a long time--difficult to find both in one book. It was full of excitement, fast-moving, and I kept thinking, this would make a great movie! This was my first Greg Iles book and I'll be reading his others, this book was obviously well-researched. The momentum never seemed to let up. Usually, I do much research on Amazon and read review after review on books before I select just the right one. With True Evil, I just picked it up at an airport so I had something to read on the flight home. What luck! This turned out to be an extremely interesting book that I would likely have otherwise missed out on. I loved it. (It escaped 5 stars, as it did get more unbelievable and testosterone-ridden as it neared the end.) But I could really see this book made into a feature film. Exciting and enjoyable!"
5,"Enthralling, Steady Paced Thriller","This was my first read by Mr. Iles & I found it thoroughly enjoyable. It wastes no time getting started. Once started, it continues on a good steady pace to the end. It holds your attention well along the way as the story unfolds. The book is difficult to put down. At over 600 pages, there really isn't any wasted dialogue. It's a very suspenseful story.The characters are believable. Despite having several characters, they are easily followed. The heroine, Alex, is completely likable in her frustration. The geographical setting is also a bit different. The story unfolds in Natchez & Jackson, Mississippi. There's also a bit of a sexual tension between the the hero & heroine with an ending which leaves a romantic interest hanging. The reader can interpret how the romantic interest turns out. This novel is good & you'll not be wasting your time with it"
4,Impressive Author,"This is the second of Iles' novels that I read, the first being The Quiet Game, which set the standard high. While I didn't enjoy this book quite as much as The Quiet Game I cannot deny that it's a great story. It seemed as though it took awhile for the tension to build but once it did, it didn't let off until the end. And one has to appreciate the amount of research that the author must have invested to tell such a detailed and gripping medical accounts.I think it safe to say that anyone who enjoys reading fiction will appreciate this novel."
3,SCIENCE OF CONSPIRACY,"First you must abandon all logic and suspend your belief system to really enjoy this book but once you do you are in for a riveting read.Greg Iles has produced a novel containing an unusual method of disposing of unwanted spouses, a set of unlikely villain(s), a potential victim (Dr. Chris Shepard) whose survival becomes a personal quest for our protagonist, a female FBI agent named Alex Morse, and a conspiracy theory involving the U. S. government and the AIDS virus. Iles does a pretty good job of informing us that there is a lot of TRUE EVIL out there in the world.....as if we didn't already know. On the negative side there are areas in this book where the plot becomes tedious and redundant such as the scenes where Alex tries, for the umpteenth time, to convince Shepard that his life is in danger. Enough already!As an Iles fan I must admit that I preferred some of his other books like Third Degree and Turning Angel, however I do not regret the time I spent with TRUE EVIL."
2,Waiting for the twist that never came.,"I guess I'm numb, but I really couldn't wait to get to the part where you find out that a good character that you trust is actually evil. It never came, but my anticipation got me to the end of the book. I guess I was looking for a twist. There were none, which was especially disappointing considering the subtitle reads, ""True evil has a face you know and a voice you trust.""Aside from that, I have to agree with the folks who complained about product placement. I mean, I was embarrassed for the author, it was so bad. It was frequent enough to significantly cheapen the novel as an art form, in this case.I bought it at the airport, and it got me through a long flight. I guess that's what it's appropriate to expect from an airport novel."
5,Thriller from the first page,"I love all Greg Isle's books, but this one is at the top, or close. From the first few pages on, it is exciting, scary, sad and happy, all at once. The good guys are really good and the bad guys bad. My husband kept laughing at me, when I would say, outloud ""boy he is one bad guy"". Now hubby is reading the book and knows why I kept saying that. It seems whenever I finish one of Greg's books I actually get depressed cause I can't wait for the next one. The title alone tells the story. He has a wonderful imagination, can handle any subject well and keeps us wanting more and more. Yes, John Grisham is fun to read but nothing like Greg Isles. Anyone that hasn't starting reading Greg should tomorrow. For me, James Patterson has lost my interest, now it is all about Greg. NIta"
5,Another Excellent Page Turner By Greg Iles,"I am a long-time fan of Greg Iles. His writing is excellent, his stories are interesting, his characters well developed. The pace never stops, and the story grabs you from the first page. I have not read all of his books, but I have read all from the past four years and liked all but Turning Angel. I would write a separate review of that book, the writing was also excellent, but I have to admit, the story made me queasy - the older man/teenage girl relationship just didn't do it for me. Anyway, I'm glad that he returned to a more suitable subject (if a story about serial killings can be suitable). True Evil is another wonderful page turner. As I've said before, Greg Iles is not for the light of heart - his novels are quite long but worth every page, every word. One of the few authors I can't wait to see a new book published."
5,Another great visit to Natchez,"I'm a big fan of Greg Iles' books, I've read them all. True Evil was excellent and now one of my favorites of his books.The story was a very engrossing thriller, the characters very likable and the familiar faces from Mr. Iles' other books was fun. It was also fun that another author I like was given a nod. As Chris was biking down the Trace I was wondering if he might see Anna.Thanks for the reading pleasure Greg!"
4,typical iles - the best kind of mystery,no blood or gore. just a solid good mystery that holds your attention and gives you hours of pleasure and oh that narrator - the best.
3,Another Geg Iles hit,"Greg Iles is one of the best thriller writers in the US and has made another hit. The setting is as usual in the deep south with an original murder plot in the center of the story. This is not Iles' best novel, but certainly worth reading."
3,Not as satisfying as it should be,"This book started out like gangbusters and immediately captured my attention and imagination. Then it started to go on a little too long. Then my incredulity started being strained. There was no motive for the contract on Dr. Shepard. I kept reading to find out why his wife wanted him killed but that was never satisfactorily explained to me.Also, I never like children in danger and here we have not one, but 2 children in the hands of evil people.I agree with the reviewer who thought about 50 pages could have been cut without harming the story at all. Indeed, it would have helped."
2,Entertaining but too predictable and hokie,"I loved Greg Iles' ""Third Degree"" so I bought this book to read and I was disappointed. The storyline was interesting and somewhat creative at first, but the closer I got to the end of the story, the more disappointed I became. The predictable ""twists and turns"" sort of reminded me of how mysteries were solved in the Scooby Doo tv shows - just too predictable and unrealistic. However, I would describe this book as entertaining and a quick read."
2,Good read,"True Evil is an easy-read and contains a compelling story-line. If our science technology is really this advanced, then be afraid, be very afraid. If I were the editor, I would lose several chapters that were unnecessary character driven dialogs. The story line by itself was very interesting. Greg Iles is a very talented writer and after reading this book, I would definately consider another of his books."
5,Love the heroine!,This is definetly a page turner! Great summer reading! You will enjoy the ride from the very beginning.I am going to read all his books.
3,Fast & Fun with odd flaws,"I purchased a copy in the airport for a trip to Europe. I plowed through the whole book in a few days. It's good and thrilling if not particularly surprising. The bad guys die while the good guys live and find romance.Iles has an odd habit of writing some passages as though he is getting product placement revenue. It's very odd when he does this and breaks the spell for me. One scene has a character turning on his dual core Macintosh G5 to download hi-def video from his Canon XLR2. Oh, and everyone appears to drink Coca-Cola. There is no Pepsi in Iles world....no Pepsi...no Pepsi at all..."
4,Great Page-Turner,"This was a great book with a fast-paced and very interesting story-line. Recommend it for people looking for light, fact-paced reading."
1,"Busy, busy storyline","This writer uses far too many ""conveniences"" to further his story. A scarred FBI lady conveniently has an ace detective friend who worked with her late Dad, and he fills in anytime, anywhere, as she can't be everywhere at once. Then she meets a sensitive, sweetie doctor who just happens to be about to be done in by his wife, and everyone is racing around, getting cancer, trying to prevent people from getting cancer, dealing with a looney who has an immediate neutralizer for home-grown cancer, etc...and all the while, of course, the FBI lady and the hunk doctor are falling in love. Depressing theme (folks getting intentionally killed by cancer), and a frivilous advancement of plot. Bottomline: Poorly written, or at best, on the Danielle Steele level. The discussions of China's likely being the U.S.'s next major problem were interesting, however."
3,Average Crime Story,"I read this book after stumbling on it on Amazon.com. The synopsis sounded interesting and I am always looking for a new author to get hooked onto. However, I will not be hooked on Mr. Iles. The book was okay - just average. Nothing really grabbed and held me. In fact, some times it was work just getting through it. Nothing terribly wrong with the novel but nothing grandly exciting either. That's why I only give it 3 stars."
4,Good but not great!,"This book is not initially as intense as Greg Iles' other offerings and one is tempted to move on, but with a little perserverence you will enjoy this book. Our heroine is a bundle of neuroses but after a while you will soon be empathizing, sympathizing, and cheering for her!"
5,There just had to be snakes!,"Yes, there are snakes in this fast-paced thriller--both reptiles and two-legged ones. I started reading it, and like all of his books, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.In a lot of nasty divorce battles, the thought that it would be easier to just do away with the spouse enters a person's mind. But, it is just a thought. Iles creates a sleazy lawyer and a psychologically damaged scientist who team up to provide this seemingly foolproof service for a very lucrative fee--both limiting the clientele and risks of their venture. All is well until they kill the sister of FBI hostage negotiator, Alexandra Morse. Iles's command of his characters and their actions are so real that it moves his fictional world into an imaginable one, thus drawing the reader into it with him. His plot has more turns than the Mississippi River from Natchez to New Orleans and moves as fast as that river on a rampage. Kudos to him for giving us another great read--snakes and all!"
5,WOW!,This was one of the best books I have ever read!!! I could easily see this as a movie. I could not turn the pages quick enough and I can not wait to read more of Greg Isles!
5,Another Winner for Iles,"Greg Iles never ceases to amaze and entertain. He is by far one of the most gifted authors I have read in a long time. True Evil grabs you on the first page, races at breakneck speed to a predictable ending, true, but still, I truly enjoyed the ride. The premise of killing your spouse rather than divorcing them is a unique storyline. Killing someone so it looks as if it was natural causes . . . and doing it for money. How evil is that? And all to save rich people money in alimony and shared estates. A rather frightening idea when you think about it. True Evil was thoroughly researched, extremely well written and undoubtedly one of the best reads I have enjoyed in a long time. You cannot go wrong with Greg Iles!"
4,"Good product, work well","Tent peg, not much to say. Somewhat expensive but they are Coghlan brand and this pricing is fairly competitive as compared online. Guaranteed unbreakable, but I have broken several."
1,Only b-movie lovers need apply,"This English dub of a notoriously stinky ""sequel"" to Snow White and the Seven Dwarves will befuddle and horrify all but the most jaded b-movie fans. Must have inspired many sci-fi directors/production designers, with its similarities to more modern flicks like ""Krull"" and ""Flash Gordon."" The dimunitive heroes defy all laws of logic and physics as they eventually work their way around to saving Snow White, who has been taken hostage by the Prince of Darkness. Thrill to the misadventures of these seven Italian midgets if you dare."
4,Beautifully illustrated with woodcuts,"Though this book is billed as a counting book, the mathematical aspect is secondary to the gentle rhythmic poetry and the unique looking woodcuts.The poem follows the barnyard wanderings of one fat, furry striped cat as she encounters a growing number of insects and animals. ""Barn cat, what are you looking for?"" The answer lies in the cool stoneware pitcher that a little girl carries from the farmhouse.The illustrations are splendid; they evoke the rural New England countryside, which was surely the illustrator's inspiration, as she hails from Vermont. The woodcuts were made on a nineteenth-century hand press and painted by hand with an earthy palette. You won't have to be a cat lover to enjoy this beautiful book."
5,21 month old loves this book,"My daughter loves this book. It is always the one she picks. She especially loves the ending and can't wait to see the little girl (my daughter calls the little girl ""Mommy"") come out to give the cat milk."
5,Enlighten your Child!,The Chinese Book of Animal Powers contains beautiful artwork. The brush strokes are full of energy and intelligence. Each of the twelve animals which correspond to the energy of a given year or month are represented. The influence of the energy is represented by animals to aid the imagination. Children love this book and it is a great entry for them into understanding and playing with their imagination. Use it as a meditation and see if you encounter yourself in a new way!
5,Let's Weigh The Evidence,"This book shows evidence why the RSV, ASV, NIV, NEV and others are attacks on the Deity of Christ, Salvation by Grace, Atonement and The Virgin Birth. It shows why the KJV c.1611 should be the Gold Standard."
1,Weigh is unbalanced.,"Mr Burton's book is a poorly written polemic on the newer English translations of the Bible. His book, in trying to advocate for the King James Bible, in fact does serious damage to his cause. His book is neither well written nor honest in it criticism of the newer translations. His errors are so onerous that one must believe that the writer was trying to deceive and not interested in honestly exploring the strengths and weaknesses of the different translation.Three examples that come to mind:1. KJV was never copyrighted. Half-truth. The word copyright did not exist in 1611 but the concept did and the writers of the KJV used it.2. The writer uses scripture as if it was speaking of the KJV. This is an outright misuse of scripture.3. The writer talks extensively of the removal of the word Lord or Christ in the new versions but never mentions where it was added let alone why these change happened. Oops. The best he can muster is that Satan is trying to corrupt our Bible."
3,Uninspired,"When I first heard ""Les Fleurs"" on the radio, I was enthralled. Even though I was in the car at the time, I couldn't keep myself from dancing in the driver's seat. Once I got the album info, I quickly sought it out and gave it a test drive. Sadly the rest of the album (with the exception of ""Hearts of Fire"") doesn't have the same zip. It's not bad, just somewhat bland. It's great in the background, but the tracks don't seem to pull themselves to the foreground. I'm not familiar with Mr. Lewis, but I've heard from others that this album is not indicative of his earlier works. Definitely curious to see what he has done before, since there is promise ""between the notes""."
3,Organized crime on your PC,"I found this game to be very fun and stimulating.The game is quite difficult especially in handling your tasks once the week started.The wars with the other gangsters are very quick,sudden, and bloody, often with you losing more men than the enemy.My overall opinion of this game is it is pretty entertaining, but i hope now that Eidos will make another one without the difficulties of the first one.Now that the game type is out, I believe there will be more to follow.I believe this is a good game for the price.There will undoubtedly be more and better mafia games to come."
1,This game is Terrible!,"If your idea of fun is running spreadsheets and playing hunt and click with your mouse, then this is the game for you. If you want a serious simulation of the 1920's ganster era, move on. There is plenty of chrome in the game and a lot of fun concepts, but the bottom line is that its a spreadsheet game that has you more interested in completing columns than robbing banks. The action part of the game has a cumberson interface that leaves your ""crooks"" out of control and more often dead than alive. You are barraged by red herring audio clues and an inablity to find where signifcant audio items have occured. Think long and hard before you buy this game."
4,Thomas Jefferson,"Thomas Jefferson was an American hero with lots of leadership experianece before he became on of the Presidents of America. Short, but interesting history with nice illustrations."
3,not bad,"I LOVE Cap Marvel. Which is why I was a bit dissapointed with this read. The art is fine. Nothing to marvel at. I finished in twenty minutes. I personally love long reads, so don't let that deter you. I guess I've just been so spoiled lately to titles like ""Identity Crisis"" and ""Astonishing X-Men,"" and ""Y, The Last Man,"" that I was hoping for something on that grand of a scale."
4,works as advertised,"7x50mm binocular works great off my porch no focusing issues. I like them better than my Winchester 42mm hunting binoculars already, because there is a wider field of view.We will see how it fairs on the open seas....The lens caps don't seem too strong. Hopefully I don't end up testing the flotation capability."
1,Terrible service,No manual or instructions are included. The light is broken on mine. I called and emailed customer service. They don't reply. Don't buy unless you want to get stuck with expensive junk.
3,Focussing.,"While I do not own this particular model, but some other makes from low to high end, please pay attention that with waterproof binoculars central focussing is NOT feasible due to the tough o-ring sealings, which require some substantial force to move fore and aft.So individual focussing or 'auto-foccusing', with limitations with the latter (closest distance is farther than with individual focussing)."
5,Another Winner!,"Alexandra buys Travis at an auction for charity without realizing what she is getting herself into. Travis knows he must have Alexandra. She's the most beautiful woman he has ever seen and she captures his heart, no matter how much he denies this to himself. Alexandra and Travis make a deal: They are not looking for committment, so their ""relationship"" will end when it ends...But they quickly realize that the deal they struck was not enough to stop the love that captures them.This is the second novel in the Baron Series (MARRIAGE ON THE EDGE, MORE THAN A MISTRESS, SLADE BARON'S BRIDE, THE TAMING OF TYLER KINCAID, MISTRESS OF THE SHEIKH, THE ALVARES BRIDE, THE PREGNANT MISTRESS, RAISING THE STAKES) and it lives up to the first. The sex scenes are hot, the passion is realistic, the characters are real and easy to love, and the story hooks you from the first paragraph.Sandra Marton is a fabulous writer and has quickly become one of my favorites. I recommend all of her novels!"
4,Another enjoyable book by Sandra marton,"The ""instant"" and fierce attraction between Alexandra and Travis, and how they act on it makes this a delightful and fast-paced read. Enjoyable and sensuous, and my favorite to date of the Barons titles."
3,A Romance Junkie,"This Story was great, I really enjoyed it. Alexandra was trying to prove she was not frigit like her ex husband's new wife (her best friend) was telling everyone. So she gets to bachelor auction and buys Travis for 20K...the highest price anyone paid for any of the bachelors. Travis, the bachelor, sexy alpha male, rich attorney, and a Baron can't take his eyes or his hands off of Alex and sparks start flying. I read this in one night, thank god it was the weekend. I recommend it highly."
5,It goes hand in hand with the play.,"""Spark Notes Much Ado About Nothing"" is a must! It gives fabulous analyzations of characters, quotes, themes, and motifs, as well as explains the acts and scenes in great detail. It'll clear up any doubts you may have while reading ""Much Ado About Nothing."" As always, you should read Spark Notes AFTER you have read the ""Much Ado About Nothing."" I recommend."
2,Stopped working after a while,"It worked fine couple of months, but now it would keep disconnecting and connecting by itself, and the pop-up (that tells you a device is connected) keeps opening in my computer that it was so distracting that I never use this port anymore. I'm going to buy another product soon."
3,"Great Name, Not so good product","Zonet makes outstanding products, but in the case of this particular item in a specific application... not so good results.Does not work well w/laptops, as it does not provide enough power for multiple devices to operate effectively.Wish I would have known ahead of time that a powered hub was the way to go."
4,RIGHT on TIME!,"George Benson's 1996 release presents a great blend of the artist's vocal and instrumental wizardry. Four of the selections allow the singer to flourish while the remaining six affirm Benson's talent on the guitar. With the exception of the somewhat derivative ""Song for My Brother"", the songs are beautiful, urban, haunting, and inspirational.One of the highlights, ""Summer Love"", sounds as if it may have been a leftover from Benson's masterful 1980 release ""Give Me the Night"". A deft mixture of lilting melody and background vocals, simple instrumentation, and a subtle bass line, the song, like many others on the album, allows Benson to vocally his OWN guitar rifts, one of his trademarks.And ""P. Park"" is a funky, little ditty that is a throwback to a time when REAL music ruled, not the synthesized, computerized, electronically enhanced tripe of today.."
5,A timeless album,"George has been a favorite artist of mine since I was a kid. I saw him once at a free concert he gave at Stern Grove in the late 90's - it was outstanding and he's a truly soulful performer. This album ranks among his better and came out a little before the live performance noted above.George knows how to blend his superb instrumental and vocal abilities in the right ratios here to produce a truly listenable album from back to front. My favorite pastime is to cruise along Mulholland or PCH, with the sun on my back admiring the view and Mr Benson drifting through my car stereo. It may sound like a stretch - though George can actually make an LA car commute a pleasure ; )"
2,"Coleman instaclip screen room,","We received the item, there was a part missing and one piece broken. We have contacted Amazon and Sportsrus about this problem. They are suppose to send us a return label, it has been 10 days and we are still waiting.Anne Sellars"
5,A wonderful story....,"I had saw this book on the shelf for at least two months I kept picking it up and putting it down whenever I saw it. Finally I bought it and OMG!!!!!!! from chapter 1 I was drawn in. I was blown away. I was rooting for greg to do right by his family yet angry at him for not fully explaining his depressed feelings about work and his father's deplorable treatment of him to Laurie. I was just as disappointed in Laurie when she failed to realize her internet romance with John was really a emotional affair and then of course letting her faith dip so dramatically. But I was glad the Wright family overcame the bumps and bruises I was cheering and jeering laughing and crying. Ms Haley is a great writer this is my first book I've read by her but it won't be my last. This story proves that with faith in god, love, strength and heart you can make it through if you belive."
2,Interesting,"I found the description of this book interesting, and decided to purchase it. Initially, it held my interest, but the story was slow after the fourth chapter. It did not hold my interest, and I read the book just to complete it. The characters were shallow, and the end was predictable."
5,Big improvement,"This is a big improvement on the style that made Phoenix Rising such a stellar effort from this aussie unit. First of all the drums dont have that clicky drum trigger sound that was present in some parts on the last album inits place are thick and heavy rolling drums that make the blood boil. Second, the sound seems a little more cohesive and the thrashier parts definitely shine through in every song. Third, the dual vocal duties are grand as both KK Warslut and S Berserker possess thoroughly wretched rasps as well as some hefty growling that are put to good use on every track. All in all, if you loved the thrashier parts on the last album but were turned off by the drum sound and poor mix then this album will certainly change your mind. A monument in war metal for the new millenium."
1,Lost Shape After 1st Wash,"The shirt was great when it arrived but I washed it first, as I do with all new clothes, and after the very first wash the shirt shrunk and basically took on a bell-shape. It's now way too short and my son cannot wear. This was a lot of money to spend on a tee-shirt (it fit the theme of my younger son's birthday party) for one time use. Not happy."
2,Disappointing,"I first heard The Rippingtons about 6 years ago on Jazz FM (UK). I really liked the smooth jazz sound but couldn't find any of their music in the shops here for years. Then I came across ""Brave New World"" in London and bought it. But instead of the really mellow music that I remembered, I found this album fairly monotonous and uninspiring. It isn't as musicically complex as I had remembered either. I am disappointed."
3,Not their best,"This one disappointed me. It's still nice to listen to, but it's not the Rippingtons at their best. It seems a little wimpy at times and subdued."
1,This may be their worst effort!,"I have been a huge fan of the Rippington's. I began listening to them in the late 80's. This is long before this CD came out. I bought it and listened to it a few times and decided it wasn't going to remain in my collection. Their are a few good songs on it, but the techno-pop and remakes of other songs made me believe that this was the beginning of the end for the Rippington's good CD's. They have recovered some since that time, but this may be their worst effort!"
5,Surprisingly Great Pan!,"I'm no cookware snob or gourmet chef, I just enjoy cooking, and I'm in the process of replacing some of my cookware, piece by piece.I thought I would try this pan, because of the size, and because ""everyone"" says that you should have at least one fry pan that isn't non-stick. Mind you, 85% of my pots and pans are non-stick, so this is an adjustment for me! This was also my first piece of All-Clad.I was surprised at the versatility of this pan, its quality, and the relatively easy clean-up -- this from a person who gets stuff stuck on the bottom all the time. But when it's really bad, I just soak it briefly in soapy water and everything comes right up! I love the feel of it and the even heating. In the short time I've owned it, this is quickly becoming my favorite pan (and my husband's, too!) -- although I haven't yet worked up the nerve to actually flambé anything!A really good choice!"
4,Good basic chisel set at the price,"I purchased this set, and was pleased with the quality - certainly for under 10 bucks. Nice to note that these are made in Canada. (NOT the prc)"
3,Fuller 3 Piece Wood Chisel,These wood chisels are basic and will serve your needs if you do entry level woodworking. I decided to keep them because I will not be using them daily. Larry
4,An excellent supplement,"Due to its old age and the advent of the New Practical Chinese Reader, I don't recommend this book as a main textbook, but as a supplement for those in their 4th to 5th semester of college Chinese, this is an excellent supplement. The readers are no longer short as they are in the first two volumes of PCR, but they are longer and more interesting. Each of the 15 chapters introduces around 60 new vocabulary words and topics range from talking about travel plans to Taiji to family. Although the book is outdated, most of the information is pretty good. And in keeping with the tradition of the PCR series, the grammar explanations are EXCELLENT. Example sentences are used to further illustrate the usage of certain words and grammatical structure, and a glossary index of the vocabulary words is in the back of the book. Overall, an excellent supplement."
1,Strips Incorrectly Cut- Cannot be Installed,"My order of this product took over 5 weeeks to deliver. Upn inspecting the contents, each strip in the box of 3 sanding strips were cut incorrectly. They are impossible to install on the sanding drum. As a result, the entire purchase was wasted. I will proceed to contact WMH Tool Group to see if they will correct the problem and I willJet Performax 60-2120 Ready to Wrap Abrasive Strips for Jet & Performax 22-44 Drum Sander 120 Grit(3 wraps in a box)post the results here."
5,a heart felt story of loss and triumph of the spirit,"This is one of my all time favorite books, actually most anything by Kirkwood is a masterpiece but this book will truly stay with yuo. I cannot even fathom how Dr.Carusso read into it what he/ she did, anyone who reads this book will see that it is nothing close to a book about a sociopath and mind games, but is really about a boy who loves the only real freind he has ever had and the story of cherishing and protecting the memory of him. It is a story filled with love and hope and finding the one place where you are safe in a world where it seems everything is conspiring against you. I am sorry that the Doctor did not truly understand it but I guess everyone will see things as they choose to. A lesson that this book projects avidly."
4,a powerful version of Unix,"When I used AIX in the mid 90s, it was probably the most advanced unix operating system generally available. Its SMIT user interface for the sysadmin was quite well done. Here, you can see much of that. IBM continued to improve AIX. SMIT is shown as relieving you of the burden of knowing and typing some very long command lines.However, this book was written in 02. When IBM was already consolidating its operating systems towards linux. Hence the heavy linux discussion in the book. Probably, much of what the book describes that is specific to AIX then is still being supported under whatever AIX you get now with your machine."
5,AIX 5L Administration,The book presents an excellent systematic presentation of AIXadministration. It is written in a refreshing style that is not found intypical AIX documentation.
2,Terrible book for beginners...,"I work at a place that uses AIX extensively. I was hoping to be able to learn as much as I could from this book to help with system administration duties in my company, but so far I've learned...ZIPPY! The book seems to assume that I've been administering UNIX since I started walking. If you are a beginner to UNIX do not get this book to learn. This being said, can anyone recommend a book for a beginning Unix System Administrator? I've been in the Windows world for 10 years, so I am familiar with things like the OSI model, FDDI, file systems, FTP servers, you know, computer stuff. I just want to become a UNIX guru to be able to help. I don't need to have my hand held for every little computer concept.Felton"
5,3-D Apple Mug--New Collector's Item,"This Franciscan Apple Dinnerware 16-Ounce Sculpted Mug is a new addition to the ""open stock"" group of 3-D items. Of particular interest to the collector, this cute mug matches the s & p's, candlesticks, teapot, trivet, biscuit barrel, and other items in this sculpted Apple pattern. Despite its appearance, this mug is quite durable for everyday use, and it can go in the microwave when filled with the requisite tea, coffee, or cider, and then off to the dishwasher."
1,what a piece of junk!,"Soooo poorly made!!!! Pieces are so thin, even the box is cheap. You could pick up any 2 pieces and they would fit together, even though they really don't go together. We did the edges, and then dumped it back in the box. It will end up in the recycle bin, as we'd feel guilty selling it to anyone at our yard sale. Gave it one star only because zero wasn't an option. Steer clear of Pressman brand!"
2,Cool Packaging...Not much Substance,"I'm a Police/Sting Freak!! I love the band and own their complete recordings CD box set, Synchronicity Concert Video, Every Breath You Take DVD, and several Sting DVD's and CD's. I bought this DVD thinking it would be some rare footage I don't all ready have. WRONG. The live footage of Walking on the moon is a clip from the Synchronicity Concert and the ""Original"" version and the Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic video can be seen on the Every Breath You Take DVD. So there is NO NEW MATERIAL TO BE SEEN HERE!!!!The packaging is pretty cool...looks like a vinyl record single.However my recommendation is skip this disc and get the Synchronicty Concert DVD and the Every Breath You Take DVD. Those discs are AWESOME!!!Enjoy and keep it groovy on the 3rd beat!!"
2,"Some useful information, but not as complete as expected.","I bought this book having grasped the basics of COM and IDL and expecting it to help me improve my designs and better understand the issues in how to develop a ""good"" COM interface.I found to be mostly disappointing from a design standpoint. Many issues which six months later I had learned were really very important (e.g. the vital question of whether to support IDispatch or not and the huge performance penalty in MFC's default use of this interface) were not covered. There are many trade-offs in COM and I found little discussion of them here.As a reference it has potential, since it is thorough and deep, but as other reviews have mentioned, it's not as easy to use as a reference as it perhaps should be.In the end, it's been sitting on my shelf largely untouched as other ATL and COM books become dog-eared with use. So from me, it's thumbs down."
2,Adds little knowledge,"The book topic is a rich one, and I ordered this book before it was published. But the author jumps around from topic to topic, and appears to have a limited handle on the material he covers. What you are left with is a lot of headings with two sentences under them. Worse, imagine a programming book with almost no code examples.Despite these problems, for the first 150 pages or so I thought maybe I was going to get my money's worth. But the last 250 pages or so are a ""case study"" that presents neither a complete problem or a compete solution. And it does so in 3 languages.I feel I know little more than I started with. Save your money."
5,"Easy and fun to read, very practical techniques","Some books, while offering good information, are written in a way that is not fun to read. This is NOT one of such books.The techniques shared seem very practical and useful. For example, the author talks about the concept of a ""self-esteem bank account"". When couples are having difficulty, they blame their partner. Blaming takes self-esteem ""dollars"" from the partner. The key to good communication is to start by acknowledging and appreciating - that puts self-esteem ""dollars"" into his bank account and makes him more loving and willing to listen. I thought that is a neat way of explaining things. The author goes on to share simple ways of acknowledging your partner and much more.Fun to read, helpful tricks, highly recommended."
5,Very Good Help!,"I bought this book after reading the first addition. It's well written, easy to understand and lots of roll-playing scenarios. I would highly recommend to anyone who needs help in communicating - listening AND speaking!"
4,Good advice,"I received my book in excellent condition. It has a lot of good advice, and both my boyfriend and I have read it."
3,"A fair supplement, but otherwise lacking.","I am only halfway through the book, but I'm finding that every chapter I read is very much a rehash of the principles contained in ""We Can Work It Out"" by Notarius et al. I find it very possible that the author has read that book and simply regurgitated the principles in his book. While I don't find that sort of thing very admirable, this book does serve some sort of purpose. That is, to supplement other works on communicating with your parter and to offer other examples of good communication. While this book was able to give me some new ideas of ways to communicate with my partner, I find the concept of ""electric sex"" utterly laughable. It's just a little too new-age for me."
2,Basic information,This book was disappointing. It was mostly common sense things that you should already know.
3,Wish it had multiple endings...,"This is a fun DVD, it really makes you do the police work. However, once you have solved the mystery, you are done with the DVD. There are no alternate endings, so really, it is just a play-once game."
4,Mystery DVD Game is fun!,This interactive DVD was easy to figure out how to play it. I played this game with my friends at a birthday party. It was fun to try to figure out who did it. I like that you could pick parts of the story to play again. The coroner was funny. I hope thay make some more of these kind of games.
4,Great Effort by Great Artists,"This cd will definately be underappreciated by all the so called fans of Rage and System and the other bands who contributed to the cd. However, this cd is not supposed to be a recreation of these bands. This is totally different and is supposed to be that way. The folk songs by The Nightwatchmen are great, and stand very well on their own. Serj's piano performances at first weren't amazing to me, but they really grow on you. The eclectic mix of covers, stand up comedy (Ahmed Ahmed is also found on the bonus features of Bowling for Columbine), and poetry flow quite nicely. I give it 4 stars mainly cause the camera quality of the DVD isn't the best in the world, but otherwise I think this is a great buy."
4,Very Good But Could Have Been Great,"I really liked this album, I never knew that Tom Morello could sing. I wish you could hear Maynard on the U2 cover or the duet he did with Cornell but they are still good covers. This is worth buying as long as you do not expect a meavy metal album. The theme is peace and that is hard to expresse when playing heavy metal."
4,Fantastic! Pooh-pooh to naysayers,"This is a fantastic album. Sure the artists involved may deviate a little from their typical genres, but it's certainly a refreshing change, and one that shows off the versatility of all the artists. One gripe: Maynard, step up to the plate and sing a little more. Other than that, it's awesome. Great music, great message"
5,Absolutly great,i thought this cd was insane. the message n proformances were great. they are super talanted artists with a great message to put out to the public.
3,Why Do I Not Want to Listen?,"I adore the artists on this CD. We share similar views, but apparently not tastes. Try as I might, I can't get into this cd. I want my CDs to grab me and pull me in, make me want to listen over and over again, but there's no such pull to this CD. The DVD is entertaining, but far from great. The camera work is just awful. Concert DVDs should bring you closer to the show, make you feel like you are there, but this one pushes you away. Good to buy to support the artists and causes behind the set; not so good for a CD you can listen to ritualistically."
1,Less than one star,"i bought this on a whim at another retailer. i love these guys. flea, tom morello, serj tank-whatever, chris cornell and maynard, for goodness-sake!!! these guys are amazing musicians and the best in their respective bands. i don't know how they put out such a terrible display of noise. it's un-listenable. i wish the retailer had a sample for me to hear before i bought this. i would've reccommended that they instantly remove it from their shelves.dont get me wrong, these guys' hearts were in the right place, but the cd just CAN NOT be listened to. just pitful. absolutley abysmal.run away screaming from this one. trust me."
1,Not worth buying.,"This was very ill organized and it was not good to watch or listen to. I really like Serj and all, but someone with me of Jamaican descent was offended when he heard Serj assume a Jamaican type accent for his Bob Marley cover of ""Get up Stand up"". He found it somewhat racist and was offended by that. It seemed like a good cause would bring the better out of people, instead of covers, they might offer some of their own material, other than Serj."
2,Paradise Lost,"I am willing to accept a non-funny Allegra Goodman book because she writes so well. But I am not willing to accept a book about a superemely annoying main character who stumbles through life, works at menial jobs, makes wrong decisions, acts irresponsibly, and refuses to learn a single lesson. Editorial reviewers who praised this book were protecting the author's career, not truthfully guiding the book buying public. Save your money. Buy a different book."
2,I didn't care for this book...,"I see that I'm not alone in not caring for this book. The main problem seems to be the main charachter. I don't like her. At first I did, she seemed to be another ""Woman in Distress, Who is Going to Make Her Own Way"". But, really, she never did, did she? I kept waiting for her to acknoledge the reality between her and her dad, but she never did. All she did was continuily remind her Dad and Mom about what failures they were. And the references to Andrew: Why DIDN'T she name her son after her dead brother? It's a Jewish tradition to name the children after the family who has passed away. I couldn't really get into this book, although I finished it. I just kept waiting for Sharon to GROW UP!!!!! Unfortunately, she never did."
1,boring... and boringly written,"I'm beginning to think The Family Markowitz was a fluke... Kaaterskill Falls had an interesting subject, even though the writing was dull and flat. But this time around, both the subject and the writing are dull and flat. Sharon is the type of person I pray not to get stuck sitting next to on a long plane or train ride. Come to think of it, reading this book is like being on an interminable flight where the self-involved, boring, not-too-bright, locked-in-immediacy person next to you yaps the entire time, and she WON'T SHUT UP, and you can't get a single word in edgewise. AHHH!! Let me off! Actually, you can just close the book and walk away, or not even go near it, which I heartily recommend."
3,A Mixed Up Woman On A Spiritual Quest,"Allegra Goodman's latest novel deals with the spiritual quest undertaken by Sharon Spiegelman. She embarks upon a religious odyssey which will take her from Hawaii back east to Massachussetts, from New Age mysticism to a tortuous return to her Jewish roots. Although this is a well written, occasionally funny novel, I did not quite find Sharon too appealing as a loser. Her spiritual quest seemed incredulous. Since I have not yet read ""Kaaterskill Falls"", I can't make any comparisons between both novels. Yet I am willing to take another look at Allegra Goodman's fine prose; hopefully her characters and plot will be more appealing."
2,Gimmie a break!,"Luckily I did not buy this book. Putting the unlikable main character, Sharon aside, nothing else redeemed the novel. Her religious journey seemed superficial and empty simply following her whims. In the end when she has found her ""purpose"" with Mikhail it seems they don't even know each other. They spend their days working to make ends meet and never hold any meaningful moments (perhaps outside of the book?) What exactly made that the moment she stopped looking? If we caught up with her in 2 years perhaps she would be a member of the Church of Latter Day Saints. Don't waste your time..Sharon will make your stomach turn."
2,What is happening to this talented author?,"I totally enjoyed Allegra Goodman's short stories, and thought that Kaaterskill Falls was an elegant, insightful work; therefore, I couldn't wait to buy her latest. What a complete disappointment! First, I just hated Sharon, the spiritual seeker in the novel. I realize that it isn't necessary to like the protagonist in order to get something out of a novel, but I had trouble getting beyond this character. Sharon embodies the worst of her generation (mine!). She is completely self centered and self serving, and all other characters exist simply to serve the narrator. This might be an interesting character study of a pathological egomaniac if Goodman had bothered to show how Sharon came to be the way she is, but all we get are hints of a lonely childhood. I hate to say this about a work by a gifted writer who features Jewish culture (my two stars are for this aspect--we need more writers like this) but I cannot recommend this book to anyone!"
2,A disappointment,"It took me awhile to figure out what I thought of this book which also made me realize it wasn't nearly as enjoyable as Kaaterskill Falls. I finally decided the heroine was extremely annoying. I expected her to become an adult long before she reached 40 for G-d's sake. The book is 20 years of meanderings of a selfish clueless girl whose supposedly deep spiritual thoughts and yearnings are far shallower than they first appear and whose character is never fully fleshed out. She never becomes anyone you would even remotely want to spend any time with. Although she eventually marries and has a child, you suspect no learning has occured and nothing ever changes."
2,Waiting for God...or Just Another Guy,"""Paradise Park"" purports to be about Sharon Spiegelman's search for God which eventually leads her to Orthodox Judaism, marriage and a baby. At the end of the book she encounters the man who had abandoned her at the beginning of the book...could a sequel be far behind? Dancer that she is, she just seems to keep changing partners.Throughout the book, Sharon never matures: she merely changes direction. Her marriage and motherhood seem very unfulfilling despite what we are led to believe.On the up side, Allegra Goodman's depiction of the various religious and social organizations through which Sharon tries to find God are depicted with honesty and wit. None of them, even Judaism, are held up to be perfection.I just don't think I've ever met a character that I wanted so much to shake and say ""Grow up!"""
1,Superficial!!!,"As someone who currently lives in Hawaii and has had a lot of contact with the Orthodox Jewish community in New York, I find this book to be unbelievably superficial, while proporting to deal with a powerful spiritual search. It is neither powerful nor accurate. What I found most annoying was the flippant way, Ms. Goodman's main character, Sharon went from relationship to relationship with dizzying emptiness."
5,The Great Mock Orange soars to new musical heights,"This is definitely a 5 star disc. Mock Orange has been my favorite band since I first heard 9s and 6s for their creativity/originality and musical talent. This album is in every way better than both 9s and 6s and The Record Play, and it is not hard to say that. I would have to give the first two discs 4 stars. Mind is not Brain is by far the most mature and well rounded of the three, their best to date and the best rock out there today. It's just plain cutting edge. The sound is new and original, the songs are more complete and the singing is right on. The Great Mock Orange will finally get the respect they deserve for this masterpiece of music. If there is another band with this sound, I would love to know. It's time for emo to get funky.I am in love with this cd, get it and tell all your friends to get it."
2,not the mock orange i remember,"I bought this cd the other day and i wish i had my $15 back, i don't know what happend to this great band whose previous two albums were supercool. they sound like they want to have a southern twang sound now, and have really slowed down, but not in a good way. don't waste your money."
1,I'll sum whole book for you,"""God is everything"". That's it. That's the whole book. You are not in control and God has a master plan already set just for you. Give yourself up to God and life will be grand.Needless to say I was very disappointed in this book. I am (was) a fan of the Washington Redskins and I am a huge NASCAR fan so naturally I was attacted to this book by Joe Gibbs.I do not mean to say that his hypothesis is incorrect (trust in God) but a 300 page book that states the same thing over and over???Don't bother with this book unless you need reinforcement that God is the way of life. But if that is your passion, you should already be following in His footsteps so there should be no need for this book. If you are not a particularly religous person, this book will be way too much for you.Save your [money]. Better yet, put the [money] in your collection plate on Sunday. It will do more good there."
3,"Good Book, but Know What You Are Getting.","Joe Gibbs is one of the most successful sports leaders of the past 30 years, having won championships in two different professional sports. This alone makes his story of overcoming mistakes very interesting. What I was not prepared for, however, was the Christian aspect of Gibbs' story. He credits all of his success to developing a full, unquestioning faith in God's plan for him. That is fine with me, but his focus on this message (witnessing, if you will) makes Gibbs' story different for readers used to your standard sports coach/leader biography/leadership module. If you want the story of a man's faith journey and his efforts in applying God's teachings to his own life, this will be a great book for you. If you are turned off by such messages, look elsewhere."
4,Football and NASCAR,"If you read Gibbs' first book (Fourth & Goal), then skip this one - since it repeats a lot in addressing his football career. Otherwise, it's a solid book - fast paced and enjoyable. Yes, he addresses his relationship with God throughout, but that is who he is (and what you may want to be, too)."
5,"A wonderful set, worth praise and study.",Amazon.co.uk can provide. Or check hardPressed Poetry. The work is a delight for the eye and the mind following it as it goes. I hear that a Billy Mills Collected is in the works from Shearsman. That would be something to celebrate indeed. (Noted January 2009--no release date for the Collected as yet.)
3,"Strange envelopes, but they work","I was a little surprised to see that the adhesive on these envelopes was actually on the lower part of the envelope instead of the flap. the odd folding makes these a bit of a pain if you are trying to send a lot of letters, but they still work just fine."
2,Security? Contents clearly visible.,"They are regular #10 envelopes, the kind we've seen for years with the blue security printing on the inside, but I think they could be a lot better. I inserted the check I was mailing and I could read every written detail down to the amount and bank acct number through the ""security"". Not impressed. So I wrapped the check in a plain piece of paper just like the old days."
2,"Self seal? Nope, not after a while.","We've got half a box of envelopes that, over time, lost their stickiness requiring that we find glue to keep them sealed. I tossed them. Not lazy, but just don't want to look for and deal with messy glue on something that shouldn't need it. Two stars because half of them worked fine."
2,Self-Seal Can Be Easily O,"I bought this, and though there would be some sort of sticker-like material that sealed the envelope. No, it's not. It has a gummy residue on it that could possibly be opened by someone else later. What's the point of a security envelope that others can peek into?"
5,Mr Lucky,Dave Grusins arrangements of Gershwin and his work with Lee Ritenour and Brasil artists is astounding. He makes everything so listenable! So here we have him arranging the great original works of Hank Mancini. The magic of both these great musicians is overwhelming. Henry wrote some great classics. Dave Grusin gives them a freshness that you will want to listen to over and over again.
2,Not enough music!,"If you're interested in the sociology and politics of life in Pueto Rico or the Nuyorican community, you may find this program interesting. If you're looking for alot of concert footage or alot of musical information about Salsa, skip this DVD. There is minimal music and no MUSICAL discussion of Salsa in this 1-hour program."
4,A brilliant snapshop of salsa.,"What a wonderful discovery to find on a clear screen young and youthful Salsa legends Ruben Blades, Willie Colon, Charlie Palmieri, ""El Rey"" Tito Puentes and ""La Raina de la Salsa"" Celiz Cruz. Made and released in 1979, this documentary has a bit too much narration but is nonetheless a magnificent snapshot of the evolution of the music. Anyone interested in Salsa must see this film. Complete songs are rare, as is music uninterrupted by the narration, but the magic is still there. Que viva la salsa."
3,good-not alot of music,very informative. lots about nyc in its heyday. but only 3 short cuts of music. lot of ploitical views. not really a music dvd but good
4,Interesting social conditions of the 70's,"This is an interesting video made up of film shoot in the 70's during the heyday of New York's Salsa movement.It is not a musical but rather a look at everyday conditions of the New York Salsa community.It has some small dance & music performances but I enjoyed it most for the insight it gave into the Salsa community during it's peak.It was interesting watching the greatest artists of this community play for Weddings, & in schools & for free.It was interesting thinking about the change that has occured since those days & now.It is really only of interest to the Salsa history persons.But I did enjoy it & I think it should be seen by all New Salsa dancers & music lovers."
1,Duh..Where is the Salsa Felipe?,I lived in the South Bronx and had the pleasure of seeing and dancing to the musicians on this DVD.Mr. Luciano wants us to believe that the characters and music he has selected represent the Puerto Rican culture that I experienced in the clubs and streets of Manhattan and the Bronx and let us not forget Orchard Beach and City Island; he fails to do this.The video is poorly made and the great Puerto Rican and Cuban musicians showcased seem to be on for 30 seconds or less.Mr. Luciano takes us to Puerto Rico to reminds us of the heroes welcome given to the Puerto Ricans that attempted to assassinate President Truman. Thank you Felipe for that moment of Puerto Rican history.There are other political comments made by Mr. Luciano throughout the video that tend to diminish the DVD even more. This is one video I would like to forget very fast.
3,acceptable,"Well... the good thing of this video is that you will see interesting scenes such as the one of Masucci walking arounf the Faina head quarters, a wedding with a salsa orchestra in which the musicians are among others Barreto, Puente and Ch. Palmieri..The bad thing is that the video is in a very documentary format.. and you will not see a complete performance of a song, but instead an off voice talking while showing the musicians doing their job.Any way, good to have it if you are a collector."
4,Server Hard Drives.,I loved the price and size of the hard drives. I will recommend this product to anyone. All of the cases were in place.
5,Excellant Record of an Unnoticed Struggle!,"This book provides a wonderful foundation for understanding the cultural norms which allow human rights violations to occur, and the foreign policy implications which allow them to be unnoticed. This book will make you want to change our policies. It enhanced my understanding of the struggles of Muslim women. A definate must read."
2,Author is arrogant and the information is sometimes not useful,"The writer of this book is SUPRISE an author of fiction books himself. He will frequently include his own stories into the textbook and show them as a ""positive example"" while frequently they're boring and I think that other author's works could have been better suited as positive examples of fiction writing. There is a chapter in this book that literally discourages every type of story line. My favorite: the one that says that you should never write about vampires because you will never make a dime. Has this person never heard of Twilight. Not to mention the book was written in 2007 AFTER the movie had came out. I think someone who has been living under his pop culture rock shouldn't be advising people about what is popular and what isn't."
3,Textbook,"While this was a textbook for me in creative writing, I feel as if it contained a lot of basic and trivial information. It has a few tips for common problems that new and aspiring writers often have trouble with. It had a lot of the terminology for the technical phrases of writing inside the book.The poetry section of the book was really critical for beginner poets and as well for analyzing poetry. It had a huge selection of poetry.The only downside that I found was that it tried to discourage people from writing certain story lines. I also feel that it didn't do a good job at explaining how to write a script."
4,"REVELATION, Completing the End Times Puzzle","Mike has unlocked the secret to understanding the end times with his convincing presentation of the ""sign"" of the Son of Man and the rapture. You've got to read this one."
4,Absolutely excellent and creative.,"This CD was a surprise and a delight. The music is imaginative and light. It's perfect as background during a busy office day or in the evening with dinner. The mood is of sunshine, dancing, joy, and harmony. There is nothing trite or saccharin on this CD."
1,Spirit of Comedy is Laughless,"The Spirit of Comedy is disappointing and unbearable to watch because of the poor sound quality. The comedians recycle hack jokes from BET's Comic View. Only one (The writer from The Parkers) out of the four comics proved they know how to write a joke. One can find a million ways to waste an hour on a Sunday afternoon; however, The Spirit of Comedy should not be one of them."
2,Comedy,"I believe this product could have, should have been better. I am a firm believer that whatever we do as Christians should not be inferior to secular products. There were some funny parts, but the host was corny and his impersonations were way off."
2,Not what I thought,I applaud them for giving it a go. Unfortunately the production value wasn't that high and the comedians were not that polished. Most of the humor was very rooted in the church which was good but the comics seemed like they needed a little more time to develop.This is definitely not on the level of other comedy dvds like HOLLA! or even Kingdom Comedy
3,OK,"Although you defenitely need to like religion related films, this one is just hilarious. It the perfect mix of God's word and laughter!*** sponsored comment"
5,Strangely Beautiful,"This collection of short stories by Sean Brijbasi has a startling quality about them. They are lucid, insightful, and strangely beautiful. Brijbasi's One Note Symphonies is a group of stories somehow connected to each other by some kind of magical sleight of hand by the author. I started reading, and kept reading until I finished the entire book in one sitting. This is a great book! I'm going to read it again. I've already recommended it to some friends, so I would definitely recommend it to whoever is reading this review."
3,GREATmovie.. POOR quality...,"This is an excellent movie. Old skool kung fu at it's finest. BUT, the dvd quality is very poor. It's not cleaned up or re-mastered in any way. The movie was clipped to FULL SCREEN, for some reason, and appears to be zoomed in for an even lower quality. At times, the action disappears off the screen entirely. There is no chinese language track or subtitles. The dubbing is hokey at times and feels comical in very dramatic parts. I would wait for a fully restored, widescreen version of this before purchasing. I give the MOVIE 5 STARS, but because of the poor dvd, 3 STARS."
5,Old,"Wow,,I'm not sure what movie that other reviewer saw,,,but it cannot be the same one I'm writing about ""The Secret Of Shaolin poles"". I though this flick was really good,,,there were fight scenes from the time the flick started to the end. Meng Fi played the famous ""Fung Sai Yuk"",,and he did an amazing job. The fight scenes were brilliantly choregraphed,,the cinematography was just amazing. The flick is definately up there among the best of the Shaw brother's productions. This is a must check out,,,,ignore that other guys review. Feel free to visit ""[...], you see hundreds of viewers gave this flick no less than 4 stars."
3,A handbook on film criticism from a theological perspective,"Despite the rather ""punnish"" title of the book, this is a thoroughly academic work, and as such it is not what one would call easy reading. Yet, it is enlightening for all who would take time to grasp the concepts presented here. The author advocates first attempting to understand what a movie is trying to convey on its own terms and then reflect upon it theologically. Basic concepts of film criticism are covered, as well as different theological approaches one may take to evaluting films. A good book for those who want to look at movies at a deeper, less superficial level."
4,Reel Good Book on Film for Christians,"I enjoyed this book. I was glad it wasn't too academic or too technical since I am not an expert on film making or movie criticism. There was good historical information and many examples from a variety of films to help illustrate the author's point of view. I agree Christians need to become more critical consumers of film. Since 95% of people see at least one film per year, it shows that there is tremendous potential for spiritual dialog with friends and family by talking about film. I plan to think through some of the concepts in the ""Theological Approaches to Film Criticism"" and ""Becoming a Film Critic"" chapters as I continue to grow in my understanding of film making."
5,Dir en grey's Major Label Debut,"Without a doubt, Dir en grey is one of today's best Jrock bands. They experiment with many diffrent styles, thus they don't fit into any one category. If I had to describe Dir en grey in one word, it would be ""Unique"". They are very talented, and this album proves it. Produced by Yoshiki of the legendary Jrock group X Japan, this album is an incredible blend of styles displaying the vesatility of this band. From slow, melodic tracks like ""Akuro no Oka"", to insanely fast and psychotic tracks like ""ZAN"", Dir en grey has something for everyone. A definite Must-Buy. You won't be dissapointed."
4,Bootleg,"Gauze is indeed a wonderful CD, but um.. I advise people to check the official Dir En Grey site and compary labels. Wea isn't the label, it's FREE-WILL. Down with bootlegs!!"
4,"fantastic, buy this album!","Dir en grey-if you like goth you`ll like them. If you like Dream Theatre you`ll probably like them. If you like pretty men in make up and plastic dresses you`ll like them. I do. Best tracks on this album are `yurameki` (`flickering`), `Cage`, `akuro no oka` (`a hill with a bad road`-sounds better in japanese!) and `raison d`etre`. A couple of dodgy metal noise tracks but mostly this is fantastic, I`d definitely recommend it. Did I mention they look damn good!"
4,A Very Understanding Study of the Gay Person,"Written from the point of view of a gay, this is a book which covers most aspects of being Gay or Lesbian with sensitivity and great understanding. It is a truly worthwhile book to read whether you are gay, lesbian or ""straight"" - there are chapters that are aimed at all. Particularly unusual and worth reading is the chapter on being gay and married."
2,Long time Dr. Who fan cannot stand the new doctor.,"Although I like Pond, Matt Smith just plays way too far over the top and is generally hard to like. I give this 2 stars because of the supporting cast and the fact that it is Dr. Who, but please regenerate this lousy Dr. and bring in someone interesting."
1,Skip this one,"I'm a huge fan of the doctor, but this episode was total crap. I honestly think it is the worst episode of the entire new Doctor Who. One horrid cliche after another- it made me roll my eyes. There's no new information necessary for continuity, so you can safely skip it."
5,doctor who season 6...,"I have watched doctor who since the 9th doctor, and I must say, this was my absolute favorite season of the show! A definite must see for any doctor who fan!On the technical side, the amazon instant video stream is pretty much the same quality of the dvds. I bought it on dvd after seeing it on the instant video, and I still, sometimes prefer the instant video over the dvds! Thank you amazon for giving us great quality streams for cheap! Totally worth the $!"
1,Black market copy?,Is this a black market copy? The volume is loud then goes real soft and then it goes real loud again. I am returning this to get a new one or get my money back so I can get another one. What a disappointment when we sat down as a family after Christmas to watch this!
4,Sci-Fi or Horror,"This season of Doctor Who is dark, mysterious and borders on the horror genre more than science fiction! Though I love Doctor Who and I enjoyed Season 5 with Matt Smith (his first season as Doctor Who), I can't help but feel like this season--so far--does not live up to previous seasons.UPDATE: Please note the blame for Episode 6 not being uploaded is not with Amazon but with BBC, which has also decided to postpone the episode on BBC America despite already airing it in the UK."
2,Far and Away the Weakest Season,By far the weakest season of the show.It gets absolutely ridiculous and there are a number of episodes that are nothing short of unwatchable.Just an absolute debacle.
2,Somewhat disappointed...,"For me, Series 6 was somewhat disappointing, and much different from the previous sets of series. In my opinion, there is much too much focus on the 3-4 main characters. In previous editions, there were some great storylines centered around new worlds and the types of people who lived there. I hope the series gets back to that direction. Cheers!"
1,Spock's Brain for Doctor Who,"I love Dr Who, but not uncritically-- which you would have to do to enjoy this stinker. Seriously, there are so many plot holes and idiocies in this one, it ranks right up (or rather, down) there with the classic Star Trek episode ""Spock's Brain"". Don't pay for this ep unless you need a Dr Who episode to watch with friends and shout at the screen, à la MST3K. Given how much episodes cost to produce, it saddens me that they wasted an episode on this drivel. I've seen better written fan fiction, not that that's setting the bar very high."
4,Pretty good Who,"Great example of the Doctor's intellect triumphing over brute force and evil conquering aliens! Lots of interesting twists to maintain the viewer on the edge of their seat.I found the ending a bit un-Whovian, as the Doctor isn't normally one to ignore loose ends, especially when someone is in need. That's the only reason this gets 4 stars versus 5.Great season opener! Can't wait to see more!"
5,"Doctor Who, Season 6 is off to a stellar beginning!","This season, from the few episodes already available, has the making for a brilliant season, possibly the best yet. Karen Gillian says that THIS is the season to watch, and never were truer words spoken about Doctor Who! The cast is turning in awesome performances, the writing both takes itself more seriously and remains endearingly light-hearted, and the cgi and visual effects are stunning. By far, the best product with the brand name on it.Well done!"
3,The Latest Doctor,This appears to be a darker Doctor and I didn't find The Doctor as witty as the previous episodes. I didn't find this quite as good as previous seasons.
5,Dr Who season 6,"If you are a sci-fi buff and enjoy intricate plots, you will like this. Season 6 is the most enjoyable season up to then, in my opinion, with cool aliens, and a storyline I never would have expected. It is great fun."
5,Hot when clever,"Though I really like all of the Doctor Who episodes, this is my favorite so far. Love the interaction between The Doctor and River."
5,"The regeneration of cool, Series 5, 6 and 7 with Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor",Watched on Amazon Instant Video on my iPad and the series is amazing. Also downloaded the Doctor Who Matt Smith (holiday) specials to prepare me for the upcoming series. Stephen Moffatt has done a superb job with this show.
4,Amazing story,All of the episodes are action filled and keep your attention. It is a great storyline tor those interested in sci-fi. I really recommend it!
5,Amazing & Stunning,This is the most amazing episode in the entire series. I'm still crying as I write this. I don't know how this one can be topped. I'll be watching his episode over and over.
5,Gotta See What Happens Next!,"This truly has something for everyone. The writing's fabulous, and the endings are delving into some real mind-bending story arcs. Me likey."
2,Not with Prime anymore????!!!,I LOVE Doctor Who and am a member of Amazon Prime as I use a Roku box at home. This show was part of the reason I became a Prime Member and now only a few episodes are available through Prime so I have to pay extra to watch these episodes. I love Amazon and have been a customer for many years but am very frustrated by this. When you pay a yearly subscription for a product you don't want to get blind-sided by additional fees for the same product after only a short period of time. I can see (maybe) paying the fee for the newer episodes (Even though Hulu doesn't do that) but not the older ones! I love this show and I can't be alone in this and want Doctor Who back on Prime!
1,HD episodes stutter!!!,Do not bother with the HD episodes of this season if you're watching on a TiVo. They play with a choppy stutter framerate that is terribly annoying to watch. The low-def versions are fine.
1,Might like it real well...if Amazon's instant video were working!,"Tried five times using two different browsers to view Season 6 Episode 1, and got ""the spinning wheel of death"" every time! My computer is excellent, my software up-to-date, and my connection is via highest-speed DSL.Methinks Amazon has not gotten its act together too well on the instant video yet."
5,doctor who series 6,"yay doctor who, this whole series has been amazing, especially the second half, so far my favorite episode is the girl who waited which just aired tonight. it made me cry at the end! this is another amazing year of doctor who where we get to know more of amy's and rory's love and depth to each character as they get pushed farther through the series. the doctor gets tested in who he is and who he wants to be, and then we learn who river is. if you asked me a year in a half ago i would of told you that i wasn't looking forward to matt smith and karen gillan but now amelia pond is my favorite companion and the 11th doctor is up at the top next to david tenant. this series was brilliant amazing, sad, action packed, unbelievable. without a doubt one of the best series of doctor who yet and did i mention madness unpredictable amazing sad brilliant amazing stories from the most amazing writers and steven moffat?did i say amazing enough? well it's just that good"
5,Are you kidding me?,"Imagine if one of your old favorite TV shows was resurrected with a ton of special effects and a huge production budget. Here you go with the new Doctor. I really like all the new Docs, each has their strengths. Matt Smith takes the baton and keeps things going-you won't be disappointed. (I predict.)"
4,I don't like these 'prequels',I don't like these 'prequels'. Therefore I rate them only because I'm required and I will keep getting emails to review it if I don't. Watch the full episode and it's good.
5,series summary,A+++ loved it. series is a shoker ending and beging too! anyone wanting to get this for other who fans if they don't alredy have it!!!
1,Hollow and Gimmicky,"The SOLE reason to buy this season is ""The Doctor's Wife"", which shouldered aside ""Blink"" and ""The Girl In The Fireplace"" and (for first time watching) ""Utopia"" (c'mon! Y...A...N...A. moment?) as Best DW Episode Ever (Thanks, Niel Gaiman). The darker tone of the season overall is fine, and I do appreciate the expansion of characters in a previously Earth-centric DW universe. Otherwise, the deliberately disjointed narratives, gimmicky, plot-hole laden deus-ex-machina story-lines, out-of-character behavior of the Doctor (NO fault to Matt Smith and supporting actors at all!), have trashed this franchise. I am stoked not for the next Doctor, but for the next Director. That said - to each his/her own."
1,I've cancelled my season pass.,"I can buy Episode 7 on iTunes right now, but it's not available here. There's no point to having a season pass on Amazon."
4,Season 6 was a come back,"Season 5 left me pissed off, at Smith AND Moffet. Seson 6 turned it all around for me: more exciting, and FINALLY a tough doctor. I hope Moffet keeps him that way, and forgets about trying to ""humanise"" him. HE'S NOT HUMAN!It brings me back to Waters of Mars. What went wrong on Mars WASN'T that he became god like, but that being alone he miss calculated the effect of his causes; couldn't perceive it. THAT was the misstake. Moffet needs to get out of the sand box, and go towards a more mature show. There's a lot in Who to grow on. He could take a lesson from Farscape, but that being said, we'll just have to wait. If he continues like season 6, and aims to stay smart, we'll be all good."
5,get in the tardis,its a new season of doctor who you either like it or you don't but its a fun frolic with the trio and river song and a good twist to start the year but wear a cowboy hat - they;re cool!
5,What is the Question?,Doctor Who just gets better and better. They can actually tell you what is going to happen the whole season and you're still totally surprised when you see it go down.
2,I think Dr Who needs an injection of new writers,"Is it me or are the shows starting to lack imagination and intrigue? I love sci fi and have been a fan of Dr Who for many decades but this show I found totally forgettable and this season a step down from previous ones. I'm hoping I'm wrong or that the season picks up soon, but I'm worried.I think the current Doctor is excellent and Amy a babe, but the whole Rory-Amy relationship just slaps me in the face every week as unbelievable. And when they drone on about their undying love for each other (when we all know that if he was the last male in the universe she would still have a hard time even going out with him) it just ruins it for me.The great thing about the Doctor and Rose was that their love was unspoken but unmistakable. That is not the case between these two. I think they need get rid of Rory and get their imaginations back in gear."
1,Season 5 and 6 are losing their appeal!,"Season four was the last enjoyable season. The latest season 5 & 6 are welcomed with a new doctor and companion but the in depth mature chemistry and in depth feelings from the likes of Mr Tenant are gone. Replaced by campy, simplistic, teenage chemistry following the likes of Twilight and filled with empty relationship dialogue make these just empty. The new doctor is like a high school teen flying around for the first time just screaming for someone to lend him some maturity! Replace these two QUICKLY!"
1,HD Episodes Choppy & Stutter,Do not bother with the HD episodes of this season if you're watching on a TiVo. They play with a choppy stutter framerate that is terribly annoying to watch. The low-def versions are fine.
1,Why are there no captions?,"I LOVE Dr. Who, but I was unable to view this particular show because there were no captions or subtitles....please caption all videos."
5,You saw this coming,If you've been watching the series then you pieced this together. 'Spoilers' ruin the fun. Their all in on it.
3,CHEAP PACKAGING,"When you spend this amount of money on a DVD set, there is no need for the DVD holders to be so flimsy that they break the first time you take a DVD out of the box.Otherwise, Season Six is extremely entertaining even though it goes off into many twists, turns and tangents. I do like Season 5 better....."
5,Doctor Who for you,Well written stories spun together in a clever way with humor and suspense. Matt Smith is a great Doctor and Amy Pond & Rory Williams bring a much needed friendship/bond to the story.
3,Season Six of Dr Who,"I like Matt Smith as ""The Doctor"", but an overall summary of season six is thumbs down. The episodes seemed bitty and only three or four of the eps were a continuation of the main story line. ""The Girl Who Waited"" was a true test of genuine love. The Christmas ep was ridiculous. Get the picture? ..........................scifigal...................."
2,Doctor Who Season 6 Bait and Switch,"I am a Doctor Who Fan, and that is one of the reasons I continued Amazon Prime after the free trial. (Of course the free 2 day shipping also ties in).I watched Season 5 and the first 5 episodes of season 6 using Amazon Prime (no charge).Tried to watch Episode 6 tonight, after a couple of months, and found that this show has now apparently been removed from Prime!Disconcerting, and disappointing!Did Amazon remove this from Prime as part of a ""bait and switch"", or did BBC America screw you over and make you change the rules.Stupid on BBC America's part, because I will find another legal/add supported source.Stupid on Amazon's part, because I am now questioning the value of my Prime membership.It appears that Amazon/BBC have conspired to come to the usual Content Gatekeepers Lose/Lose Solution!Garth"
4,Sets the stage,This sets the stage for the whole season. This season was a far improvement over last season and is worth the watch. Each episode will give you a 'spoiler' for the end show.
4,You saw this coming,If you've been watching the series then you know what was going to happen within 5 minutes. I think he caught a cold for the next season though.
4,Gods are what we make them,"This is a 'spoiler' episode and reminds me of the 'The Curse of Fenric' with Sylvester McCoy. At the end someone has to let go, so the doctor can win. Needs a new story line."
1,Availability issues,"It's 7:12 eastern standard time June 12th, and the latest episode of Doctor Who (A Good Man Goes to War) is not available. It IS available on iTunes. This is unacceptable. For a service who's only real standout is the ability to stream new programs rather than downloading them, I'm beginning to wonder if it's worth it or not. I could have already had this program ready to watch now had I chosen to get it from Apple.Shame on you Amazon."
2,Dr. Who moview,One of disks were scratched when we opened them up. The center ring in one of the inserts was broken and this damaged the disk. the rest of the service was OK.
5,Great Season Worth the Money,"Not a season to start watching the show if you've never seen it, but for anyone who's a fan and kept up with the previous season(s) will enjoy it. Also a bit more mature then the previous seasons. Any doubts on Matt Smith vanish."
5,Once again I love it,"I've always enjoyed Doctor Who, the new team is really fun and resourceful, every new season it's even betterI'm looking forward to se the next season"
4,So it was a filler,It was definitely a filler episode but it was the Doctor so I couldn't bring myself to give anything lower than 4 stars. The season started out strong and this episode was not as suspenseful as the first two but it had great aspects in it. I am looking forward to the rest of the season as I know the action will pick up.
3,"Love the series, Dislike DvD Quality.","My box is slightly damaged, which is not much of a problem.The DvD's skip at points causing small irritations.There are about three skips between all the discs."
4,Fast moving,The first episode leave you hanging. This episode starts out holding nothing back. It's like Battlestar Galactica where the action starts and doesn't stop and it does. It gets slow then picks up again.
1,Time to cancel,"No episode? I think people should start calling to cancel their amazon prime memberships and asking for refunds. I doubt Amazon will listen to anything else, unless it has an effect on the bottom line."
2,Grrr,"I haven't had any trouble before now downloading anything from Amazon and now all of a sudden, I'm having trouble downloading The Doctor's Wife. This is my third call to customer service and its really annoying. I hope this isn't a new trend. I really, really want to watch The Doctor's Wife. :("
5,A Thriller about Brain Manipulations,Ben Ashurst was living a peaceful life as a student at Oxford University until he meet a famous investigator who offered him to participate in a research - as a volunteer human guinea pig - bases in emotions and reactions but what he never expected was that his trip to Kenya ended in a nightmare and back in England an almost persecution mania because of situations given to study his reactions and feelings without his knowledge and consent. These limit situations make him angry and curious and start investigating until the find out the real purpose and the brains behind the project. This is a very psychological thriller in which the reader have to pay attention to every dialogue to follow the sequences of the experiment and Ben's emotional responses to the manipulation and the second thoughts of the researchers.
5,Pleasure!,"I must admit I usually don't have the patience to read books, but this one was so gripping and captivating, I even read it during work :-) Even if I predicted some of the twists, it was a pure pleasure. plus an interesting thinking of emotions control, something which never occurred to me. I wish the end had been a bit more romantic, not so cold. Even if a little love confession (another one) from Ben to Cara. Well, I guess the fact the book ended with 6 times the sentence ""I love Cara"" is a close enough... I really liked that Cara character, even though from some point I did not believe a word she said.Thanks to the author for the great pleasure of reading the book. Well done!"
4,"Hitchcockian beginning, desinit in piscem, I'm afraid","The beginning is superb,and,well,the soiree whit those blase' Oxfordians and their naive hosts is beautifully written, and the dialogue is worthy of a dramatist like Pinter. Following it, a more plausible, politically conscious version of ""the Beach"" (if you care to compare two very different novels). Then, you have a series of ""revelations"" and ""twists of the tale"" that leaves the reader baffled, incredulous, doubting of being put-on. Really,there's a limit to the suspension of incredulity... and credulity. You feel admired by the writer's ability to startle. Then the book wawers on, the plot and the gist lost in dubious speculations and improbable settings. Conclusion: a good enough first novel, but there's plenty of room for improvement."
3,CAMPY COSTUME CLASSIC.,"Margaret Lockwood is an aristocratic woman living during the reign of Charles II. Bored with her titled life in the country (as Lady Skelton), Lockwood takes to becoming a highway robber in order to have some ""spice"" in her life & through her sordid escapades, she succumbs to an ultimately tragic end.....The film was actually one of Britain's most popular films of the 1940's owing to its atmosphere of gloomy sin. Lushly photographed but surprisingly boring. Excepting James Mason's performance, it's rather badly acted. For the American release, there was footage in a carriage which had to be re-shot: the ladies' decollectage proved to be more than the censors to allow. While I'm not completely sure whether this video refers to the British Gainsborough picture which was first released in 1946 (there was not much to go on in order to identify the film detail-wise here), I thought viewers would like an alternative to the inept re-make in 1983 which starred Faye Dunaway."
1,Nothing like the original,"I have a substantial set of Desert Rose made in California that I inherited from a family member. My original set is absolutely beautiful. The craftsmanship is amazing. Each piece has wonderful details in both the texture of the ceramic and the hand painting.This piece is made in China and is NOTHING like the original. The butter dish is clumsy and bulbous. The top of the butter dish does not fit neatly into the bottom but rather flops around. The ""rose"" on top is simply a blob. The painting lacks any kind of detail found in the original. When placed side by side to the original they don't even look like they are part of the same set. Save yourself the disappointment and look for an original replacement piece with a USA backstamp."
1,Tom Thumb Gets Thumbs Down,"Film students with a pension for the old ""Godzilla meets Mothra"" genre will love this video. Definately, a plus for individuals who study Children's Literature and the various forms used to tell a similar tale. Don't let the colorful cartoon character's on the cover, lead you to think this story is about the old farmer & his wife who wished for a child of their own. This adaptation, with it's original Latin American language dubbed over in English, is more reminiscent of Jack & the Giant(a.k.a Jack & the Beanstalk). Certainaly, no cartoon for youngsters under the age of 8."
3,Good for those who want more information,Aubry and Caputo offer further explanation into the why's of criminal interrogation. Despite being written in 1980 (3rd ed.) the information holds true. Good book for those studying more than the how-to's of interrogation.
3,Better borrowed than bought !,"Its not a bad book if you are trying to get an overview of ADSI and have no prior experience with it but its certainly not the ""professional"" book it claims to be. The code snippets are amateurish. The editing is slipshod and there are several ambiguous sentences and even occasional grammatical errors. The code samples show you the very obvious things that you could learn by experimenting with the interfaces yourself. The author somehow does not seem to trust the intelligence of his readers and makes the samples repetitive - there are atleast a dozen samples that just iterate through various collection classes and spew stuff into a webpage. He also breaks off into frequent discourses about COM and ADO that are rather elementary. It would have instead been reasonable for him to just proceed on the presumption that we knew our basics on these subjects. Still its not a bad book for a novice to skim through."
5,Well done.,"If you need to learn ADSI fast and to implement it fast and with a good understanding, You're in the right place. Mr. Robinson as usual by the way, is a fun writer simply take the advantage on that and don't waste your time in MSDN as i did. I said to myself OK that shouldn't be that complicated it is just an Interface to tree... Well it is just an interface but now i understand how it works. I also like the mix and much of VB and C which gives one a good understanding of COM's back house work."
2,"tedious, longwinded and artless","If you want to spend $50 for the heaps of tedious descriptionof SIMPLE ADSI programming skill, buy this book, and you'll surely bedisappointed.This book is so verbose and artless, the author likes to overwhelm reader with so, so many personal comments, most of them completely unnecessary! WHY couldn't he just describe the FACT, the simple FACT and simple SKILL of ADSI programming?Only going through the first chapter makes me feel so headache, I just want to know HOW to use ADSI to develop LDAP-compliant Directory service, WHO cares about HIS comments, what seems to the author humorous comments seems to me SO boring!Maybe the author is proficient in ADSI programming, but I suggest him learn the concise and clear writing manner.In this book about less than 35% is useful, more than 55% is useless comments, the rest depends on your judge. END"
5,an Enid Blyton fan,"This is the first book in the Secret series and the most exciting one of them. It's about four children who run away from home. They set sail to an island nearby to hide out. Even bringing along with them a cow and some chickens. What makes this book so fun to read is how they were able to survive on this island. There are descriptions of caves with secret entrances, wild berries to pluck and eat, a club house made completely from interwoven willow trees, cooking and eating at a campsite, hiding from the grownups that are looking for them to drag them back to their mean aunt and uncle. A dreamy whole summer until it starts getting cold. The story does end with the desired happily every after and the promise of more adventures to come."
5,Fantastic story for young readers,"This was the first book I ever read entirely on my own, and I'm happy to say it led to a lengthy affair with the written word. It remains, to this day, one of my favourite books.Its a story of 3 siblings who's parents have died, and they have been sent to live with their abusive aunt and uncle. Their only solace is a local boy who has even less than they have in life. The 4 of them plot and execute their escape. Its an excelent tale of adventure, with a great ending, and is perfect reading for someone just starting out.The story is set in england in the early to mid 20th century (It was written around then as well) but this doesn't alienate the reader. I first read it in the mid 1980s and found I could completely relate to the heros of this story.I highly recomend it to get your kids away from the boob tube and start them reading. It worked for me, and I have the attention span of your average gnat."
2,rusts nickel strings,"where my strings go under the guide it causes the strings to oxidize. I haven't tried stainless steel strings but I imagine they would fare better.In addition, I recently installed a Kahler 7410 tremolo on the bass I was using this on, and it causes the strings to go sharp whenever I dive them. I've ordered a roller tree to replace this one. if you're not after the original Fender look, save your money, order once."
5,Hacking,Awesome book for information concerning hacking. Very well written and easy to understand. Great seller. Super fast delivery.
5,To Die For,"Ive had cheese cake in my day, but, this is without question the best cheese cake ive ever tasted. It melts in your mouth. 5 *****'sT Kestly Naples FL."
3,Strangely addictive,"I was initially disappointed when I opened this book -- as ""kid-lit"" I didn't see the value in running around collecting stars, other than as an extension of the ""starcatching"" theme in the TV show (which, not having cable, we don't watch). But my daughter (who has just turned two), LOVES this book, and never tires of removing and replacing the punch-out stars in the book. She calls them all by name, and will carry them around with her. It's too bad there isn't a better story surrounding the star-catching activity, since she constantly talks about what little story there is. The whole purpose of the book is to collect stars, rather than engage in some other Dora adventure, with the star collecting as a side activity. However, I can't argue with the fact that my daughter is ga-ga for this book, and so I give it three stars..."
1,Wish I'd known -,"One of the perks of this item was the ability to transfer files to a PC. After reading all the good reviews, I bought it only to find that Olympus provided no drivers for the Win XP 64-bit OS. I wrote to Olympus and received back a short comment that no, they don't have a driver and I should buy another product. Gee, thanks, Olympus. I will, and it won't be Olympus."
3,Buy It! Unless you use a Mac Computer,"I bought this recorder as a gift for my girlfriend, and it works great, the sound is good and the buit-in mic range is good too. I was dissapointed when I found that I can't sincronize it with a Mac. That's very bad, because I usually work with a Windows PC but my girlfriend work's with Mac.I recomend this recorded, if you don't use Mac."
1,Doesn't transfer file to my PC,"My computer is very up to date, fast, and new. I installed the CD that came with it, and then when I plug the recorder to the PC, no transfer of voice recordings.I really really really wished it transferred. I am very disappointed."
1,Poor sound quality,I bought this for my daughter so that she could record her voice lessons - for later practicing. The sound of the accompanying piano is distorted - even when recorded at the highest quality rating. Very poor sound quality overall. Choose another product.
3,nice for the price,"Product works well, but really not great for meetings. Best if used in a personal setting without too much background noise. The PC software is easy to use and the 4 different folders on the device are nice to have."
5,Great and Cheap,"The quality on the mic and the playback is remarkable. It says in the product description that you can get around 30 hours of record time on it. That's true, but it's on the lowest quality. On a quality level that you would actually set it to you can expect about 6 hours of record time. The quality is amazing, the mic is super sensitive, and you can't beat the price."
5,Exceeded my lofty expectations,"I'm a reporter for a newspaper and as such, I sit in town meetings almost every day. These towns are full of mumbly, old, low-talkers that I can't even hear a lot of times myself. I gave the VN2100 its first real challenge, sitting in the second row of such a meeting. I expected this to work better than a microcassette recorder, but when I popped it in my computer (which works flawlessly) afterwards, I could hear EVERYTHING perfectly. And you have no idea how low these men spoke tonight. I can't get over how amazing this recorder is and I can't imagine giving it any less than 5 stars. I expected it to work, but I never expected it to work this well. Buy it."
5,Fantastic,I purchased this recently and it help me a lot on my business trip and some of my conferrence. I can record and replay through my computer software. It's fun and reliable.
4,Voice recorder.,An awesome gizmo. the sound is of good quality and clear as long as background noise does not interfere during recording. in-built speaker not very good but enough for on the spot use. File segregation is easy and useful and file transfer to the computer is good too. Although sharing of files is a bit difficult until you get the hang of it.All in all a good product.
5,"Like being there, but not!","This is my first experience with a digital recorder. I can notimagine ever going back to using a traditional ""tape recorder"" again!I am using this recorder for college classes. It is very senstiveand picks up all of my lectures clearly. The amount of time you can record is more than adequate and playback is very easy. I suggestreading over the instructions and taking some time to experiement withthe recorder before you use it!I highly recommend this product, it has made my lifea little more manageable!"
4,"small, lightweight and good quality","I bought this three weeks ago and have used it three times already for lectures. The best voice quality seems to be on HQ with the lapel microphone you can order seperately. Batteries seem to last a long time and there is plenty of space for recording. What I don't like about it is they do not sell a case. (Although a universal cell-phone case from Wal*Mart works well.) The other issue I have is you have to use their software every time to remove/copy the file to your computer instead of showing up as a drive, like a flashdrive does. If I had known in advance that I would have to do this I may have been swayed to try a different unit. So far it's been worth the hassle for the price."
4,Greek vocabs review,The cards were in perfect condition but was expecting them to be packed by lessons order not alphabetically for easy usage
5,Perfect,"Fits perfect. Looked like the right style so I ordered it. The old one was yellowed, and disentegrating... lol. This pops right in."
5,Perfect,"It takes 10 seconds to install, be sure you don't brake off those small wings on the side. Also, be sure you use the right mount of Watt for the light bulb you will use!"
5,A lickerish gift!,"Nelson Rangel has demonstrated with this album, why he is nowadays one of the top sax players in the genre. Owner of an impressive versatility, he plays the flute too with surprising results. The wide range of rhythms, cadenzas, romantic inspiration and Latin moods, make of this album one your must-have at the moment to choose it. Once you have listened it, you will convince by yourself. But try with a close friend and require it about this album. The answer securely will be the same: gratifying and extraordinary. Go for it without delay."
5,"Hot, Sexy, Soulful",Another incredible project from Nelson. This CD is packed with a diverse range of inspirational music that you will never get tired of listening to. No two songs are alike. Chuck Loeb produces and plays guitar on most of the tracks. A must have for your collection.
1,Projects & methods are outdated,"This book published in 1986 may have been an uptodate methodology at that time, but has since been outdated and in my estimation is not worth the money."
4,Patchwork booklet,"Contains a very nice patchwork Christmas stocking pattern.Book is in excellent condition. Thank you,"
5,Surprising!,An excellent book with wonderful puzzles by Mr. Berry. Lots of helpful suggestions for constructors as well.
5,Amazing book,"If you're interested in constructing crosswords, this is a must-read. Patrick Berry is a professional puzzlemaker. His crosswords are known for being smooth, full of great vocabulary, and junk-free. Here he illuminates many parts of his construction methods. And if you just like to solve, it includes 70 puzzles! Essential reading for crossword enthusiasts."
5,Great book.,"Great book,extremely exciting! Will read the rest of the series! Good moral and Biblical values. Read it in one day it was so exciting!"
2,Just not the same,"This dvd fails to capture the intensity and fun of the others in the series. Although there are a few acts that do rise above the mediocrity, over all this is just not a good purchase. If you are desperate for some live music, yu would be best served looking elsewhere. The afro-cuban allstars and ozomatli ARE excellent here - and that crazy imani coppola is a high point, but overall this is not a step forward for the series. Spend elsewhere."
2,Could have been better,"It lacks a general overall theme, and seems to be a mismatched conglomerate of different artist not always at their best. It is worth watching once, but I would not recommend purchasing it."
2,the first actual review of this dvd . (SHOW ME THE MONEY),"i waited 3 months for the release of this dvd. compared to the first sessions at w54 , it is a bit disappionting. the 1st sessions contained multiple individual outstanding performances. while the acoustics remain excellent on vol 2 , i remained relatively unstimulated. steve earle , ozomatli , john hiatt , and afro-cuban all stars are very good on this dvd. because of the greatness of sessions keb mo 97 , and sessions vol 1, i look forward to vol 3."
5,"Stepping In, Stepping Out","He's the average looking guy you see walking down the street every day, maybe at the laundry, on the train, and maybe you even nod hello, and maybe he leads a secret life of daring and espionage and bling, but probably not. No, in all likelihood he is not very different than Mr. Hatch, who works in a shoelace factory, and eats the same cheese and mustard sandwich for lunch, then sometimes when he's feeling a little bit crazy, a prune for dessert. All he needs is love? Well, maybe. Or, at any rate, the possibility that someone else is even paying attention to his existence when he isn't looking. It's hard to exactly place the source of joy we can make of other people's affections, and pass on, still even when they are the result of misunderstandings or postal errors, they are bound to leave some traces where we would not remember to look. Because what is community spirit finally but thousands of the tiniest gestures? An iconic, and sincerely felt, reminder."
3,Love,I rated this book 3 stars because it is strange. It is kind of depressing because Mr. Hatch had his box of chocolates taken away when he was so happy to get it. He doesn't get a lot of mail. If you like depressing books this one is for you.
4,Great Grill - Good thermometer!,"Had some trouble in the start - but had a bad battery or two in both units (sender and receiver). Once I solved that, it works fine as advertised. May need to get the receiver/transmittor close together for initial contact, but I then have used it up on my second story appartment in the kitchen to keep track of meat on the grill. Would like to be able to set my own temps (beef has multiple settings, but not pork or others) but it can be paused on the beeping to continue to cook to higher temps. Overall - I love it! Sending one as a gift now!"
2,Weber audible meat thermometer didn't work.,"I have just attempted to use my Weber Audible Meat Thermometer 6439 for the first time and despite following the instructions, I am unable to get the receiver to receive a signal from the transmitter unit.Both the transmitter and receiver are indicating power, but the receiver is showing no signal. I have changed batteries (both units), reset the units but nothing works.Apart from not recieving/transmitting the thermometer is unnecessarily large, the sound quality is poor and you can not choose temperature and have to stick to preset temperatures.It is suprising that Weber tarnish their brand name with such a product"
1,Dissapointed!,"This thermometer is a real dissapointment from Weber. There is no finer grill made, but this thermometer is a leaves a lot to be desired! The temp probe goes up to 716 degrees, but the LCD display has a maximum of 199 degrees, so you can't check the internal temp of your grill or smoker if it is above 199, and nobody cooks at 199 degrees. All cooking temps are preset and cannot be adjusted. The user instructions are in about 15 languages but so small they are difficult to read and are also, at best, VAGUE! The jack for the probe must be pressed into the opening in the sending unit very firmly to fully seat. Part of the plastic housing for the probe jack actually goes inside the hole in the sending unit, which is recessed. Otherwise, the probe will not stay in the sending unit. I am very dissapointed with this product and have informed The Weber Company of my displeasure."
1,Total waste of money!,"I would agree with Mr. Singer, with one exception...the darn think never worked even once. For about 5 seconds the receiver displays current temp and then goes back to blank. I not only wasted my money, but also lots of time trying and trying and trying to get it to work."
2,TALKING THERMOMETER,PRODUCT NOT WORKING UP THE WEBER STANDARD. SIGNAL IS DIFFICULT TO READ FROM REMOTE UNIT. NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH IT.
5,"Natalie, We Hardly Knew Ye","Natalie Wood lived her life in the public eye. Thirty-eight of her 43 years were projected in larger-than-life images. Yet, until now, we never knew her whole story. Suzanne Finstad has provided us with a meticulously researched record of a life that seemed to those on the outside to be a fairy tale, yet behind the velvet rope, she knew fear, cruelty, betrayal, and brutality. Nonetheless, despite all of this, Natalie was always the kind of human being anyone would be blessed to know, let alone, love. I can only hope that the truth, told at last, can finally bring her the peace and the justice denied her all these years."
4,Poorly written,"I was very excited to purchase Natasha, but found the author so repetitious. She repeated over and over the many character defects her parents had constantly all through the whole story. It was like, in case you forgot Natalie's mother was phychotic, and her father a crazed alcoholic, as if I needed to be reminded of the constant dysfunctional behaviour of her parents.However, I appreciated really finding out who Natalie Wood really was. She certainly was a survivor through it all and managed to get lost in her fantasy of roles and even a better actress with her real life."
3,Leaves you wondering...,"Natasha started out as an interesting read about a young Natalie Wood and her obsessed mother. But, this goes on a little too long. We hear constantly about Maria, Mud or whatever name her mother goes by threats that Natalie will drown in ""dark water"" and that she doesn't have the body to carry children. Paragraph after paragraph is devoted to her ""disformed wrist"" hidden by a bracelet. The first 18 years of her life are minutely detailed - so much so that I skipped pages because it was more of the same.The adult Natalie is not given so much attention. Her first marriage to Richard Wagner is less than a chapter. Her marriage to Gregson is less than a chapter. The birth of her children that is foreshadowed to be a harrowing experience - is barely mentioned - yet we get more of that wrist saga.The death of Natalie is covered better than I expected - and the information at the end of the book offered by the skipper of the boat is very interesting. I hope he writes a book."
3,Too much psycho-babble,"After reading this book I got the feeling the author is a frustrated pop-psychologist. Almost every page had her incessant psychological ""observations"" and conclusions. On and on she trolled about the wrist, the fear of water, the Natasha/Natalie dilemma, the age difference between Natalie and her director/lover, ad nauseum. Less repetition would have made for a more interesting book and would have cut out about 100 pages, at least. Where was the editing?"
3,Quibbling,"Re ""A writing lesson needed, April 20, 2002"":Really, if one is criticizing an author's writing style in so short a review, that one should be absolutely sure one's own critique is grammatically faultless. ""Very often it's unclear who the author is quoting."" Tsk! A most common error! ""Who"" is a direct object here and should be ""whom."" Enough! Nice to see a labor-of-love biography once in a while."
2,Definitely not a page turner!,"I was in awe of Natalie all my life and I am grateful to read her life story. Indeed, it was very insiteful. However, the style it was written in was trite ,redundant , and poor. Aside from the facts regarding Natalie's life, I almost regreted to turn the page for more repetitive nonsense. The experience was like looking at a dress that had no style,color or form. It was very boring! In honor of the book--the sequence Natalie's life appeared to be very thorough,but remained a real sleeper."
1,The dangers of tabloid journalism.,"People need to be aware of the dangers of believing tabloid journalism.The writer's main aim is to have a top selling book so if an artists life is 90% good and 10% bad,then the writer will make the 10% bad seem more like the 90%.They will sensationalise trivial facts,exaggerate or even make it up based on gossip or comments from vindictive people or disgruntled employees.Tabloid newspapers do this all the time.It is the same with movies.For example anyone thinking that movies like The Right Stuff,Braveheart or Gallipoli are ""real history"" are kidding themselves as they are movies,not documentaries.Movies are fictional renderings as are tabloid books.The aim is to entertain,not to tell the boring truth.Natalie Wood was a beautiful movie star who had a great life.That's all,but that kind of book wouldn't sell would it?"
2,A book for those with short term memory problems,I was always in awe of Natalie Wood. She was a beautiful woman and a great actress. I was hoping to find out what she was really all about. I was througly frustrated by this memory practice exercise called a biography. About 100 pages of repetition and repetition of facts could be eliminated. Enough is enough of the wrist problem. Did ANYONE proof read this book? Did Finstad ever look at what she wrote after writing it? Finstad should stick to research (which she does well)and give the results to someone who can write. If you have a short term memory problem you will enjoy this exercise.
4,This book was very well researched,"This biography really helps to get to know Natalie's off camera persona, her compulsive personality and her insecurities. A very talented actress, very sweet and proper all the time but with so many internal conflicts. I loved that the author researched her career movements i.e. movies, auditions, co-stars, locations so well including getting testimonies from several people on the same storyline. The author tried to get everyone's point of view, version of the facts which helped us understand Natalies demons. I only wish that the author would have research a little bit more into the secret life of Natalie's husband Wagner (gay?) and also more about the other important people in her life."
3,Informative but depressing,"I just finished this book and was left with a feeling of depression over a lost, tragic life. The book raises many questions about the night of Natalie's death and leads one to wonder why her husband was not questioned more aggresively. It certainly seems that he knows more than he's saying. I agree with some of the other reviewers that much of this book was repetitive. However, if you are interested in Natalie Wood, it was worthwhile."
2,Wanted to like this....,"Too many references to circa 40s-60s trade rags (how valid could those quotes be since the whole industry is based on facade & artifice)for me to take this book seriously. I was eager to read this bio - she was beautiful, talented and died tragically. I still get weepy watching Splendor in the Grass. The lack of substantive interviews regarding any decade of her life and the scenario portraying her death turned me off. Could the circumstances of her death be true? Maybe - it's better left as a mystery as reading the purported events in this book."
4,A detailed biography,"I very much recommend this books for Natalie Wood fans. This is a very thorough and detailed account of her family, work, life, and tragic death. There are also a lot of pictures of Natalie, her family, and costars. I thought it was an honest portrayal of Natalie; there is apparently some disagreement on different aspects of her family and her relationships, but this seemed to be balanced and the author admitted when she was writing things based on fact or conjecture. She obviously did her homework and contacted multiple sources to get the most accurate information possible for this book. The only reason it was not 5 stars was that for me, the beginning dragged a little bit. There was quite a bit of information about Natalie's ancestors that was slow to get through. But once I actually got to her childhood and career, it really read fast, and towards the end I was captivated and couldn't put it down. A must-read for fans."
5,"Wonderful, thorough, objective, intimate view of a Hollywood legend","This is the first book I ever read on Natalie Wood (since then, I've read every book out there). It peaked my interest and by the end of the book, I felt like I'd known her myself. Suzanne Finstad really did her research with extensive interviews with everyone who knew Natalie - some intimately, some vaguely, and some professionally. The result is a thorough, accurate, engaging look at her life from birth to death. I'll also say it's objective in the sense that Finstad writes the facts as they exist - she's not writing out of any bias and doesn't hold with any of the conspiracy theories surrounding Natalie Wood's life and death. Whether you're a fan of Natalie already or just interested in learning more, I would highly recommend this book! A great read :)"
4,great book.,"great book, very insightful. it exposses a very fragile, scared, and insecure woman. who nonetheless had the bravery to remain an icon for so long. i also read on a website that the mystery actor that raped her, was kirk douglass, whom she'd met on a movie set when she was a teenager."
1,A writing lesson needed,"Whether the you agree or disagree with the author's conclusions and the robustness and reliability of the research that informs them is a personal choice. What struck me most about the book is how badly written it is - something I'm afraid it shares in common with a great number of celebrity biographies puiblished today.Natalie Wood deserves better than an author who does not know the difference between the words ""determinism"" and ""determination"" or how to use them correctly, to give just one example. The author also seems unable to construct sentences in a logical sequence. Very often it's unclear who the author is quoting.As I say, the content may or may not be accurate - the style, I'm afraid, is poor."
4,I love Natalie!,"Yes, the book is repetitive. But it didn't bother me much because I got to learn more about the star I've admired for so long. If you want to know more about Natalie Wood, read the book. One problem: the ending raised a lot of questions. Which I suppose is appropriate, given that no one really knows what happened to her except Natalie. I just wish there was more fact than heresay."
2,Turgid,"I finished this book,but it was a struggle.The author seemed more interested in Natalie's mother than her.(Maybe she should've written a book about Maria,instead.)She seems to think of Natalie as a victim.I found the book repetative,especially in the telling of Natalie's childhood and teen years.I also felt that the actor who raped her might have been Kirk Douglas.He fits the bill!All in all, a disappointment.I read Lana Wood's book about Natalie several years ago,and don't recall it being this boring."
2,"Repetitive, Poorly Written","Clearly, I am a fan of Ms. Wood. This books was given to me as a gift and I was excited to read the behind-the-scenes story of Natalie Wood's life. However, the repetitiveness of so-called ""facts"" about Ms. Wood and her family/friends - as presented by the author - and the poor command of the written English language makes reading this book a chore. I'm not sure who allowed this book to be published as is (what, no editors?), but it's a shame to attach it to the life story of one of the best actresses of the era. Disappointing."
4,Good,"This book was a good one, I read it in a week. But gave it away to a friend. I didn't think it was really worth keeping around, but its a good read if you like to read about famous people."
4,Who knew Natalie Wood was a method actress?,After reading this book I realized she became one at the Actor's Studio in NYC. The same studio that made Brando and her Rebel costar James Dean. After Dean died Nat studied there. She made a film for Elia Kazan (Brando and Dean's old director) and became more of a method actress. I hate the part of this book that compliments her also costar Warren Beatty on his looks. Natalie and other women's are what matter most in life.
5,A necessary volume for the WWII historian,"If the researcher is seeking one book that presents wartime Yugoslavia completely and objectively, this is it. Tomasevich clarifies a complex subject which is frequently one of the least understood aspects of WWII. The book also lays the groundwork for an understanding of post-war unfinished business which continues to plague the region. A necessary component to any library on the Balkans."
2,Boating for Dummies,"If you didn't know anything about boats and you hated reading, then maybe this video would offer some insight.This is the basics. A ""one size fits all"" approach to boating instruction.One thing I can say with conviction: it is better than nothing (no instruction at all)."
2,"Therapeutic for the author, but too fluffy for the reader","The author wrote this booklet and drew the illustrations to help her work through her depression. I'm glad it helped her, but I found it to be an extremely thin and repetitious ""don't give up."" That's an important message for people suffering through depression, but I found no insights worth holding on to."
4,Well illustrated and good insights,"Irwin's ""Conquering the Beast"" features some very nice illustrations but a few appear as if she drew them within minutes. Her advice and commentary on depression are indeed accurate and helpful. Still, Irwin and others who have experienced depression must recognize that anti-depressants do not really ""conquer"" depression. Although they certainly are a miracle, anti-depressants control and subside the symptoms. One hasn't really ""conquered"" this horror of an illness until the roots of the illness are finally gone. Nevertheless, I would buy or give this book to any teenager struggling with depression, or even family members of a depressed teen. Often those closest to the patient know little about this illness."
3,I was expecting more for 100 bucks,"Bought this for $99.00 Xmas of 2008. It's a nice table top game, very easy to assemble, however, I did not like the quality of the ""slide"" on the top of the table. Not enough air getting through to the top. Still, we had fun with this until my kids got bored with it."
1,Customer Service,"Table was received broken the day before Christmas, I contacted them the day after Christmas and finally got a pickup order issued on Jan 29 so that I could return it to them for a refund."
5,Expensive Kiwi brilliance,"I was lucky--picked this up for a fistful of peanuts way back. But it is worth it (maybe not 100 bucks!) Strong, imaginative songwriting with a lotta of the ole Farfisa organ, reminiscent of their first album ""A Cuppa Tea"". The Tasmans incorporate catchy Chills-esque songwritng with over-the-top electronics. This is a wild blend of beautiful songwriting and real anger (see the Verlaines). Any devotee of Kiwi-rock needs to have this, the first album, Somebody Ate My Planet, and Store in a Cool Place. The most recent album is thoroughly unnecessary."
3,188 dollars,"This album is listed new as $188. I don't know why, it must be rare. Their first album is much better."
2,Interesting Theories but Not of Much Practical Value,"The single most valuable item in the book was need often stated need to think of powder mixing as a different process from liquid mixing. The two strive for similar ends but by very different mechanisms. As a chemical engineer with much liquid mixing experience, this was useful. But having purchased this book to aid in solving some pressing powder mixing problems, the empasis on theory was a bit disappointing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,Whatever you do not buy or rent this movie. It is yet another ignorant portrayal of Puerto Rican reality done by some outsider...do not support this movie.
1,Save your money,"Racial issues aside, it's a horrible movie with no strong storyline, no plot, and what was used to budget this movie was used to feature a rapper here and there. That should be a sign of trying to reach out to fans of these rappers so that you would watch. The same reason why Pun was on the movie poster. To put asses on seats because that would be the only way to get you to watch. No good actors (go to imdb. If they have other credits its because only the director gave them a chance) and the writing is off.Director/writer: go to film school, please.Actors: take an acting classes. Don't think you have a natural talent. Even the best actors take a class here and there to perfect their craft."
3,It was aight,it wasn't too unbearable.I must admit I watch it constantly but only because of Frankie Negron's sexy self.If not for Frankie I'd probably rate it a 1.
1,Boricua's Bomb,"This movie is an atrocity. It portrayed Puerto Ricans in a negative way and left me feeling that there's no hope. I know that life in the 'hood can be harsh, but this movie was completely over the top. It was completely unfocused on any character. Sometimes I thought one character was being focused on and then another. I only hope one day that someone makes a great movie about life in the South Bronx.Don't buy it!!!"
4,Part adapted to do the job,"Not being sure of the required part number, this looked like what I had. Although it wasn't exact it was easy to modify and now serves the purpose just fine. Good value and delivery"
5,BEST YOGA GUIDANCE IS HERE,"Every human being in their heart loves the peace andbliss that comes forth in meditation. Unfortunatelywe may give up due to lack of guidance, too much stressand sometimes too complicated teaching, doctrines andso many barriers to hinder our true self shining forth.The Advanced Yoga Practices lessons are one of thesimplest to understand and apply in daily life becausethey seem to come right from the hussle and tussle oflife. They belong to no sect, religion or faith but toone who is seeking truth beyond beliefs. I have foundthem to be terse and right on target for the personliving in the world. I strongly recommend the lessons for all.Humanity really needs something which frees it, even while living a worldly life.Yogani's words are the simplest and easiest to follow and apply.Go ahead with this adventure, for it is coming to your door.AKC"
5,A Book To Be Treasured!,"If you are an advanced yoga practioner who meditates, or just setting out on the yoga path, Yogani's book will be a worthwhile investment. In his book, Yogani shares his wisdom, through lessons and via the experiences of other yogi/nis. His book inspires me greatly and for me, a priceless gem.I am so greatful to Yogani, and for the book he has put together. He's a wonderful person who is doing something so worthwhile for the human spirit, and it would be a great honour to shake this man's hand one day.Thank you Yogani for all!"
4,great looking!,i love the look and feel of these boots. they are super comfortableno pointy toe or stileto heel. The only negative so far is that theheel seems to be wearing down quickly. i get tons of compliments wheneveri wear them.
1,"Unstable, expensive support","I purchased this product two weeks ago to convert some PDF files to searchable format. When I could get the OCR to start it did a good job of converting the text. The interface was difficult to use, and in about 20% of the runs the application would hang before beginning the conversion. When I attempted to use set up batch scans the system crashed while I was configuring it in 100% of the runs.I would have reported the problem to technical support, but the publisher charges per incident. To be fair they do offer to wave the charge for the first incident, but since the program crashed in the first five minutes of use it seemed like I would be contacting support more than once. I finally took advantage of the 30-day money back guarantee (I'd highly recommend checking that this applies if you're thinking about buying the program) and purchased Adobe Acrobat Professional 7.0 instead."
1,Problems abound,"The real headache began when I attempted to ""activate"" the program. I spent hours trying to activate it, to no avail. I got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems. Now, I would just like to get my money back. I have used ScanSoft's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it, but, for whatever reason, OmniPage 15 has become, for me, an expensive nightmare. After having spent many hours trying to activate it, I still have not succeeded. Their support leaves a lot to be desired. For one thing, they keep ""bankers hours"" so don't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours."
2,Not as good as ABBYY Fine Reader . . .,"I work in the Digital Library world and after testing both OmniPage Pro 15 and ABBYY Fine Reader 8.0 before embarking on OCR work-flows for a major digital repository, the results were by far better with ABBYY especially with faded or 'garbled' text from bad photocopies and other secondary sources. OmniPage is a better known product, but don't be fooled: ABBYY is the real deal. (they both claim 99% accuracy and most people say they are the same. . .after testing both, you find out that they are not even in the same league).The only thing I can say about OmniPage is its interface is easier to work with and its automated workflows are a snap: but if your looking for consistent OCR--go with ABBYY."
2,read the fine print,I had expected this version to handle pdf files. It does not - you must buy the pro version. The OCR function does work well though.
5,Best OCR software available,I purchased this product because I like to keep all my documents filed on my computer. I am able to save time and effort using Omnipage 15. It converts all of my documents exactly like my original and converts PDF files into editable documents.Time and ease of use plus many other tasks are everything this product provides the user. I just like it so much 2 of my friends are using it now.
1,uninstall problems,"I would have given 0 stars if possible. I bought this program to scan some pages and had a lot of problems, so I uninstalled it. Unfortunately the program seems to have taken over my scanner and every picture I scan now is unreadable. A popup tries to reinstall Omnipage and won't let me open the picture files any other way. So all my scanned pictures are unusable. A company spokesperson said I could get technical help unintalling. Yet when I call the number he provided, a machine tells me I need to pay $19.95 per minute! Then puts me on hold!"
5,Omnipage 15 Great,"Omnipage 15 is the world's number one OCR program that is easy, and accurate to use. It is great to edit, scan and save documents. Another great feature is that Omnipage 15 recognizes 100 different languages."
1,How BAD is this??,"This is dreadful. Boring, slow beats, constent beats, BORING beats. its so so so so so so so bad. its worse than a week in ibiza which it tries to be. way behind on current cool stuff....this IS NOT COOL....ITS BORING"
3,prefilter adds to cost?,I believe this one is more expensive because it has a carbon pre-filter for odor removal. but is it really worth 2wice as much?
5,Gorgeous book- a favorite!!,I had this book as a child and was always captivated by the illustrations. I loved the story of the tygers and their adventure to lands unkown. I am not sure where my copy is (at my mother's house I'm sure) - but at about 24 years old I felt compelled to seek this book out and have a copy for myself. Now I have a toddler of my own and he loves animals. I hope that he will grow to love this book as much as I have.
5,"Zeno DeLuxe ""Chronographe Compliquie"" Moon phase","The watch I have recently bought ""new old stock, box and papers"" has the Valjoux 7761 movement, identical to the one in this watch but for it being manual winding rather than automatic. I much prefer the former as I don`t find winding a watch too much of an inconvenience. I have a winder for my automatic watches.Mine has the identical features except for a gold case and Roman numerals rather than Arabic. It also keeps excellent time, losing less than a minute a week.The folks at Zeno tell me mine would have sold for ""about $4,000"", considerably more than I paid for it. Unfortunately my model is no longer in Zeno`s inventory but the one shown is virtually the same watch, the most complex watch I have ever come across for anywhere near this price."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This is the worst pitcher I've ever owned. Even my husband can't muscle the lid on after making the drink - of course, said drink is spilling everywhere during the effort - and the stupid little green spout thing falls out constantly. It's only held in by two teeny little bumps that fit into holes in the lid. I solved the issues by first, running the lid under HOT tap water so it's pliable enough to fit onto the pitcher, and second, we just tossed the stupid little green thing in a drawer and left it there. Was going to be one star, but gave it another one for the shape making stirring easy and being dishwasher safe. Would NOT buy again."
2,Great drink storage pitcher-horrible lid system,silly green top will NOT stay in place; seems stretched out after a few washes/uses. Family refuses to use the lid; too much trouble to pour from. Wish I could return it! Don't waste your money.
2,Handle Too Small,"The pitcher is about the right size for my needs, but the handle, while long enough, is too narrow. I have large fingers and they barely fit through the handle. This makes the pitcher awkward to use. I am going to have to buy something else."
3,BPA free??,"I've had 2 of these for several years and I love them. They fit great in the fridge and don't leak. One of the lids is very stiff to put on, but it's been better over time. The only problem I have is that after finding out all about BPA, I'm replacing all my plasticware. These are old enough that I doubt they are BPA free. Hate to get rid of them, tho."
2,"Tiny, illegible maps. Useless.","The maps are miniscule, reproduced to fit into a single spread, where they are squeezed between commentary. The type on them is so small and blurry that it was impossible to read, even with serious magnification. This book was a complete and total disappointment. Instead of an informative, legible reference, Manhattan in Maps is nothing more than a ""coffee table"" book, and not a very good one at that. If you're looking for maps you could actually refer to and learn from, this is not the book for you. Hopefully, someone will get the hint and put out a quality folio of these valuable maps."
2,5-star-text 1-star-maps,"I only wish I had the access to the maps that Augustyn and Cohen had in the preparation of this book. Unfortunately for the reader, these maps are not in the book. What's in ""Manhattan in Maps"" are photographs of maps which in the case all but 6 of the maps are reproduced in a manner which lets you see the outline of Manhattan and no detail in the map whatsoever. There should have been someone involved in the production of the book who was familiar with other books of this type and included for each map some section enlarged to actual size. Some of the maps featured appeared to have been reduced 10x such as a 72 inch map shrunk to 7 inches. The text is wonderful. If the book is every republished, I hope the editors take heed of the reviews here."
4,Amazing travels,"My little boy and I really enjoy this book. It has bright colored pages. It is short. It is imaginative. It is different. It is simple. We feel like we have visited all the different places mentioned just from reading it. After reading the book, we talk about where else we would visit and what we could bring back."
5,old boyfriend whitt,"this girl is amazing. we dated while i lived in ft myers, and believe me she is as good live as she is in a studio. great voice and beautiful to say the least."
3,Not the Best,"If the best music piece of his ""Love Will Conquer All"" is not included, this album cannot be considered as the best. But, fortunately, this album includes Midnight Mood and a new piece, ""Find Your Way,"" in which George Howard's part is relatively small: the female vocalist dominates this music piece. And ""Let's Unwin"" from Attitude Adjustment is not included, either.Overall, I can't say if this album is a good buy. At least, if you don't own any of his CDs but want to get to know George Howard's world, since ""Love Will Conquer All"" is not included, this may not be a good buy."
2,It reads like a masters thesis,"This short book regarding Indian Boarding School experiences in Canada reads like a masters thesis. It was fairly dry and I had to force myself to finish it. However, it did have a ""saving grace"". The forward to this book was written by Randy Fred, who wrote about his life prior, during and after entering Kamloops Indian Residential School. Ms. Haig-Brown is a professional educator and tried to reinforce that tribes are taking control of the educational systems involving their children now. She did not address the cultural values involved in the meaning and goals of education, which continue to conflict between the mainstream and traditional cultures."
1,What a piece of garbage!,"I was unfortunate enough to buy two of these crappy clocks.First one died in just under a year. The second one jumps between daylight savings and regular time at random, which messes up the alarm.My advise is STAY AWAY from this one!"
2,Off button is WAY too close to snooze button.,"snooze button is way too close to the off button. when i'm reaching for the snooze button in a half-awake state, i regularly manage to accidentally hit the off button. Because of this, i have to have a second alarm set, and IMO, that makes this alarm useless.Also, the ""backup battery"" is a button-cell battery. Nothing that i'm likely to have spares laying around. a more common battery would be nice.Something is wrong with the low battery light. When i got the clock, the light was on (indicating low battery) so i went out and bought a new battery, and the light is still on.Build-quality is on par with any cheap electronic device. In other words, it's adequate for it's intended use."
5,I like it,"Good use.Very much like the morning able to listen to music to get up, and the original is not a difficult task to get up."
2,Its okay for the price,"Wish I would have bought a better one, this one sets its own time which is great except it is 5-7 minutes fast, so far I can't figure out how to adjust the time to the correct time. Radio speaker is tinny."
3,Dead battery cost as much as the clock,"Well, the headline is a bit of an exageration. I paid a little over $16 for this clock. When it arrived the back-up battery in it was dead. To buy a replacement battery here locally was over $11 almost as much as the price of the clock. It would have been ok if the seller would have just sent a new battery but, that was not an option so, I wound up sending the clock back. When I was trying to see if I could get a new battery sent I found that Amazon then had the same clock listed at a lower price than what I had just paid for it. Talk about adding insult to injury. I can not tell you how well the clock worked since several of the features were not functioning without the battery."
5,Good for the price,Pro:-This alarm will wake you up even if electricity line goes down-Radio alarm can be extra loudCons:-non radio alarm is too soft-snooze alarm 10 minutes and not reconfigurable
2,clock that can't tell time,"this clock ""automatically"" sets time. unfortunately, it is the WRONG time. after over an hour on line with their on line chat, they suggested i can set up a repair request. the chat person would ask me the same question 3-4 times before he would get each answer. being disabled, I cannot get to the post office, so I', out of luck. i am stuck with a clock radio that forever will tell the wrong time. I'll get lots of adding practice over the next few years."
3,Disappointing compared to predecessor,"I owned another model of the Sony Dream Machine and grew to love its appearance, large numbers, and LOUD alarm buzzer. I bought this alarm, attracted by its two alarm function and alarm volume settings. However, the Alarm buzzer is WAY too quiet, I am a heavy sleeper so I need a loud alarm buzzer in order to get up.I have discovered that the radio comes in quite clear, and the radio volume is much louder than the buzzer. I have now started using the radio alarm setting exclusively to avoid sleeping in. If you don't mind waking up to a radio versus a buzzer, this is a high quality alarm with easily adjusted clocks."
5,Great Alarm Clock Radio,"This is a basic alarm clock radio for a great price. Accurate and reliable. If the alarm won't wake you up, you have been drinking too much. The radio works fine. When I want High Fidelity I use my entertainment system I really like it."
2,A clock that can't decide what time it is....,"I got this alarm clock one year ago to replace an old alarm clock that had seen better days. It does everything it should: decent quality radio, TWO alarms (very handy for us busy college students), and automatically found and set the time even after the power went out in a storm.The only problem I had realized was that the timing mechanism in the clock seems to be just a little bit, well, off. After a few months of having the alarm clock, I noticed that in comparison with my cell phone and my laptop, the clock was running about 3 minutes fast. No problem, I'll always be a little early. A year after purchase, the too fast problem has steadily increased and my clock is now 12 minutes faster (and not getting any better). I was able to override the automatic time set feature, but the problem keeps coming back. The timing mechanism in the alarm clock is simply wrong and I am now in the market again for a new alarm clock and all too soon at that!"
3,"Worked great, until it didn't",Knob to turn alarm forward/backward now only turns the time forward. Back to Sony for a refurb I guess and out the $3-5 to ship it to them.
3,decent,"Nice for the price...I like almost everything about this clock.It's really easy to change the time on the alarms, and I like that there are two alarms. Nice if you and your spouse don't get up at the same time. The only thing I didn't like is the way you turn the alarm on and off. I'll often turn the alarm on or off when I'm already in bed but with this clock I have to turn the lights on to see the dial and make sure the alarm is on. It's also larger than it appears in the image, so if you don't have much space on your night stand, this could be a problem. It's about as deep as it is wide.Otherwise, nice and worth the try for the cheap price!"
3,Too much frustration for a dumb battery,"My old auto time set clock radio died after having replaced the internal battery for 5 bucks. Popped onto Amazon to get a new one. Sweet, nice and cheap....$14 bucks. I take it out of the box today and the internal battery is dead! Crap.....and of course, the new battery I just purchased for the old dead clock is the wrong type. I figured it should be easy to go on the Sony site and get someone to send me a battery....the thing is new but maybe sat on the shelf a while or something.... I start an online chat with what I can only imagine is some sort of robot.....only to find 15 minutes later that they want me to send them the thing! Yikes.....guess I'll just eat another $5 bucks and get the damn battery!!!!!"
3,No instruction manual,"SONY ICF-C318 WHITE. I rate this only 3 stars because no instruction manual came with it. I am finding it very difficult to set (I'm technically challenged!) without the instructions. Amazon won't send me the manual (and now it's too late to return the clock!), and Sony very nicely gave me a link to the manual in PDF format. I saved the PDF file to my computer. However, when it prints, it prints in TINY type, it's impossible to read. I am quite familiar with my own computer and printer, so I've tried umpteen ways to increase the font, but nothing doing. I hate to throw the clock away.If some kind soul had the instruction manual and would be willing to scan it and send it to me, I'd be eternally grateful. I can also receive it via fax. Write me directly to harrison220 at juno dot com."
4,good,good product except radio.bad sound and hard to catch the signal.the speaker is noisy.but easy to work and good design.
4,awesome clock!!!,Out of the box this clock comes and you plug it in and the time and zone are preset. My only gripe is that the clock was set 4 mins fast which i adjusted. the brightness of the numbers is excellent actually it is very bright it can be adjusted to lessen a bit. some reviewers had an issue with the am/pm indicator dot yeah in the dark you cant make out which it is but i am sure if you go to sleep at an average time of 10 pm and you wake up in the middle of the night and it is 2 you know it is 2 am and not 2 pm unless you just slipped into a mini coma.It is an awesome purchase though i have had it only for 2 weeks now I have nothing but the best review for it.
5,Great for an alarm clock,We got this for my daughter because her wind up clock wasn't waking her up. Works great and I love all the settings it has on it.
2,alarm is very quiet and doesn't wake me up,"well maybe it's just me but this alarm isn't very loud. I like that it has 2 alarms but the alarm is very quiet even on the ""loud"" setting. I slept through one alarm completely to where it wasn't even ringing anymore. then I adjusted the alarm time to the time i woke up and it started going off so I know that the alarm was on the proper setting and guess what... I fell asleep even with the alarm going off. honestly dont give in to the Sony name and pay attention to this products series name.. ""dream machine"" because it will surely keep you on dream land and late for work or school."
2,Not what I expected.,"I own a Day Spa in New Orleans. It is very important that all of our treatment rooms have the same time. I thought an atomic clock would be a good fit. In theory when you plug the clock in and set the time zone, the clocks should be the same time. This is not the case with the Sony Clocks. I am not sure if I just don't understand the concept of the atomic clock but it was certainly not what I expected. I ended up having to go to each room and set them manually. Kind of defeated the purpose in spending more money to get the atomic feature. Overall, I would probably not buy these clocks again."
1,DON'T BUY,I have ourchased 2 of these clocks. They are horrible. They do not keep time. The first was 17 minutes off this one is 5 minutes off. You cannot set the minutes to keep it accurate as it is suppose to do that automatically. BUYER BEWARE!!! JUNK
5,Ammmmmazing Alarm Clock,"Like display on it. Like colour of it and saying with one word it's amazing. The alarm sound is not so loud but when you switch it to the radio alarm, you can hear it from 1st floor :) very loud. It also works with battery"
1,engineering degree needed,"per amazon's suggestion, i am to contact sony tech support and see if they can walk me through setting the darn thing. i got it b/c of the gentle alarm, but it's a nighmare to set. If it's still too much of a hassle on the phone with sony, i'm sending it back."
3,Add $5 for new battery,"All in all I like the various functions of this clock. It is what is represented in the photo and description. However, mine was delivered with a dying battery. Therefore I had to go get a new one for about $5. So now it's a $20 clock and there may be better models for that price."
1,Didn't work,"I bought 2. A little ""cheap"" in construction. I set both to make sure I don't accidentally bump the nobs and turn one alarm off. But I like the softer beeps. So one is OK. I really wanted one that would set forward or backward. However, the second one I didn't get out of the box until I had company since I bought if for the spare bedroom and it doesn't work at all. Now since it is past my 30 days, I guess I am out of luck."
3,Definitly got a problem,"It's not bad, but I have read several ratings that claim it does not set automatically to the correct time. I have that problem with mine as well. It always sets 3 mionutes fast, so whenever you check the time, you have to subtract 3 minutes from whatever it is showing, to get the correct time. Plus I used to get room temperature with my old bedside clock, and I really miss that now that I no longer have it on this Sony."
2,Not as described,"I have 2 of these and, 1) I requsted black and got white and 2) the clock isn't that easy to use. I just want one I can plug in and not worry when the power goes off; this isn't the case. the biggest is I cannot stand white!"
5,Very good no-frills clock radio,"I wanted a simple clock radio to replace my simple Sony clock radio, which unfortunately got ""fried"" during a lightning storm. This model seemed like the logical substitute, and it does exactly what I want it to, with no complications. Even though I don't live in the US, it gives me accurate time after power outages (its internal battery works great) and everything is easy to set, with time controls that go up or down -- meaning that if you miss the time when setting it, there's no need to do the whole 24-hour rotation again. Brightness can be controled so that this clock never wakes you up unless it is supposed to. I've had no problems with the alarm volume or any other aspect of this product. It is a great bargain, with a low price and great quality."
1,Even one failure is a failure....,"While this alarm looks good, the other night, without me touching it one time, it just lost an entire hour. Exaactly one hour. We didn't lose power, and all other clocks in the house were at exactly 6:30AM. Mine suddenly displayed 5:30AM. One hour lost, to the minute. Oh, and when i reset it, i noticed it had also lost a month, not that i pay attention to that, but it was stuck on November instead of December. Luckily i sometimes wake up before my alarm does, but if an alarm for unknown reasons loses an hour, that's not a dependable or reliable alarm clock."
2,Clock time is way is off,"Like another reviewer, I have found that the time is off and there's no way to adjust it! My clock is now approximately 18 minutes fast, which drives me crazy - I have to compute the time in my head when I look at the clock, instead of having the clock do it for me - seems like the function of a clock, to tell you the correct time, right?"
3,Sony Duel Alarm Clock,"When I was searching for Alarm clocks I used the search term ""Atomic alarm clock.""This does have a time zone setting on it, but does not auto set. I put it 2 minutes behind my Atomic clocks to see if it will ever set. It will not.The alarm on this clock is about as loud as my digital wrist watch. Not loud enough to wake me up. May want to use Radio instead of the beeping alarm. I will use in my guest bed room.It does come with a CR2032 battery as a back up power source so it wont loose the time when the power goes out. It is easy to set and has duel alarms.On day light savings this year the clock did not automatically update."
5,Alarm Clock,This is the best little alarm I have ever owned. I plugged it in and the correct time was all ready there. Setting alarm is fast and easy. Delivery was very fast. Can't say enough good things about this purchase.
4,Sony Dream Machine,Had a older Dream Machine for 10 years til the snooze button wore out and just wanted another similar like it. This alarm radio is a real good device. the only thing that could be better is a digital radio station readout instead of the sliding analog which is a pain sometimes but the stations do come in pretty well. Still a digital readout for stations would be better. I also like the brightness adjust on the display so it isnt too bright at night and love the dual alarms so i dont have to keep changing it all the time and its really easy top use. Sound isnt great but it isnt a Bose either.
1,Buzzer is whisper quiet.,"I don't like to use the radio for the alarm, I prefer the buzzer. But this alarms buzzer is so quiet, even on the loudest setting, that I must use the radio for the alarm. Since the main point of this alarm is to wake me up, the quiet alarm makes it almost useless unless I use the radio. Also the buzzer buzzes once, waits 3 seconds and then buzzes again, which is annoying."
2,useless,"2 stars because it tell the time. otherwise, it is bulky odd shaped and not visible when there is lot of light."
2,Sound quality is poor,"I'm really disappointed in the tinny sound quality. Maybe it's a good value if it's mostly used for the alarm, but if you're hoping for decent sound quality, don't buy this one."
4,Very good alarm,I love this alarm for the ease of setting and turning on the two different alarms. This was of the utmost importance to me as it was the reason I bought it. Two downsides are that you can't set snooze to be less than 10 minutes and my clock is slightly ahead with no way for me to change it.
4,Sony ICF-318 Dual Alarm/Clock Radio,The product is very good. It set the time automatically if there is a brownout or if there is a time change.
2,10min snooze....REALLY,do you really want an alarm with a minimum snooze time of 10 mins?? That's the shortest you can set.
1,Is Not What You Expect,"This is NOT an atomic clock that self-corrects, even though the description suggests that. Read everything carefully, then go buy something else."
1,Bull Shit!!!,"This is the worst product I ever bought and it is disheartened!!!.I purchased this product and it never worked for 1 minute apart from the fact that I receive it late.T think I should have value for the money spent on this type of product.Imagine how much I spent on this product I am an international buyer. I shipped to US before shipping to Nigeria making multiple cost of shipment.Honestly speaking I don't have value for the money spent.Supposing I have zero star, I will give."
5,very good choice,"Needing to replace my old alarm clock. and not wanting to spend a great deal of money, this is the clock to pick. I love the duel alarms, set at 2 different times. Like the battery in case we loose power, then I also have a radio to play/use. Simple to program, large to see and easy to use the buttons."
4,Great clock!,I highly recommend this clock - love the fact that you don't have to set it! The radio is okay but typically as it always happens when playing radios in the office there seems to be a hum from all the interference from all the computers/printers/etc. Still for the value it is worth it..nice that it has two alarms!
3,alarm clock,It is a good alarm but the radio is not good. Loud alarm!! And the dual functtion is good. sets time by itself when plugged in and comes with the back battery.If you need a simple alarm clock that will work well this is it!! But but a radio separtate.
3,Too Bright,"I liked this clock, nice size, dual alarm, auto time, etc. Ultimately it was too bright for my bedroom and it's keeping time in the basement now. Also I found the time/alarm set to be awkward (too fast/slow)."
3,PRETTY BAD - but still beats some of the others!,"Well it only cost about $12 - and it's worth it I guess.I've tried much more expensive alarm clocks that are even worse.Display can be dimmed for night use - not really dim enough, but better than some. I think the engineers who design these things must never actually test them as, well, alarm clocks.The self-setting time feature is worthless. Expect to set it yourself, as we did.Buttons on top have very little tactile feel and it's difficult to tell one from another till you get the hang of it. We've had the clock a couple months and I still hit the wrong button sometimes.Sound quality is even worse than many other clock radios I've had - but so what, it wakes us up.Tuner discrimination is atrocious. Stations merge together in a staticky mess unless you get it dead on. After mucking with it we were able to set it to wake to NPR, so I guess we're happy.Overall - It gets the job done. Don't expect too much."
4,"Weak Batteries, Incorrect Time Set On Arrival","Like others, my weak battery indicator was lit, meaning I had to replace the batteries on the each of the two units I purchased.The one thing I don't yet understand and can't find the answer to is, When you unplug the AC power, to simulate a power outage, is the display supposed to be blank? When I tried this test, the display went blank but when I plugged it back in, all the times were correct.Do I have a defective Dream Machine?"
4,"Works great, but snooze is 10 min",This alarm clock works great. I like that it has two alarms and a battery in case the power goes out. The only thing I don't like is that the snooze is 10 minutes. I wish it was 5.
3,Radio review,The reception was poor . I have no idea if it was my location or not but my son lent me his ken wood cd and radio it played great . The poor reception went away with the ken wood so I would say this was not a good radio but you get what you pay for .
2,Sony ICF-318 Clock Radio,"The good: Nice design, easy to use, great control layout.The bad: I bought this Sony ICF-318 because the Sony ICF-218 units I purchased all gave off a audible hum. The ICF-318 suffers the same flaw, but the hum isn't quite as loud.Like the Sony ICF-218, this clock radio emits a clearly audible hum that comes through the speaker as long as the unit is plugged in. This hum can be heard from 2 - 3 feet away. Given my experience with two Sony ICF-218 units, I am sure this isn't a defect but rather very cheap components and poor component layout on the circuit board. It sounds like the speaker is resonating to the 60Hz hum of this clock radio's transformer, which is inside the unit. Sound quality is also poor."
2,OK Alarm,"This was a pretty cheap alarm, so I shouldn't be too hard on it. But there are a couple things that are annoying.First, it's so light that it easily falls off the nightstand when I sleepily try to hit the snooze.Second, I try to ""trick"" myself about what time it is and this alarm doesn't let me! I can't figure out how to set the clock early - it's accurate, but I need to set it early so I actually get up on time.Third, the set buttons are right on top and are huge! So it's easy to turn it off or change the alarm time without meaning too (see my first point)."
5,Great Clock!,"The clock wakes me up really gently as the buzzing starts slow and then gets fast. The radio on this thing is awesome too, you could use it just for the radio if you wanted to, it sounds fine. The time is accurate and there is two different alarms you can set. I set one for the weekday and weekends, display is large and easily readable with different light settings. The only problem I have with this thing is that it is on the large side, there is a model with only a single alarm if your looking for something smaller."
1,Sony ICF-C318 Automatic time set clock radio with dual alarm,"The instructions were the most confusing and useless set of instructions I have ever encountered! Therefore, the item is totally useless."
4,Great alarm clock,"It has everything I wanted for an alarm clock. I like that the alarm isn't too obnoxious, and I like that it has two alarms. Be sure not to set your smart phone too close to it, as it starts to make ghost noises.... O.o"
5,Its hard to say I love something that wakes me up every morning morning but here goes...,I am a very heavy sleeper and if someone tries to wake me up its like bringing down the wrath of Satan to Earth when I react.Needless to say this clock does it every morning without flinching. I love this clock because it lets program two alarms and automatically fixes itself for the time changes. It also does is annoying job TOO well in the morning.
2,"Sony, Not Sony Quality.","This products display quality is Great. Everything else though is not .Does not have a antenna so Poor radio Quality (radio Quality Isn't That Great.)Buzzer isn't that laud, enough for normal sleepers, (can't wake up in deep sleep.)you can set 2 alarms."
5,Very Easy to Use.,I bought this for my wife. She hates complicated alarms and this is by far the easiest we have found. Multiple alarms are easy to switch between and changing the alarm time is easy. It comes preset. The backup battery should last a very long time. It is hard to screw this one up.
4,Inexpensive and easy to use,For $14 you can't get anything better. I really like it. I got the one in white. It's easy to use and set up. The radio sound quality is great but I have a problem with reception in a few certain spots in the house.
5,Great Look Alarm Clock,"I bought this alarm clock for my mother who is deaf. The box said that the alarm could be set very loud. We also found that by setting the alarm to the radio, we could make the music very loud and she could hear it quite well."
3,LED Readout not as bright as I had wished.,"The radio alarm work wonderfully, and I got exactly what I saw in the picture. Somehow I was hoping for a brighter readout. Nice clock though, very pretty."
5,Great alarm clock,This alarm is everything I wanted. It plays the radio well. It as two alarms you can set. It's easy to use. It's not too cheaply made. I think it's going to last a long time. It's nice looking. I recommend it.
1,Unreliable because of construction,"Bought this for less than $20, opened it up and noticed that the knobs to switch the alarm back and forth were extremely loose and way too easy to turn. This knob controls whether the alarm is set to - off/ buzzer/ radio.I didn't think much of it when I set it up. I've had it for 2 days and as I hit the snooze button this morning, I must have brushed the switch to the off position and my second alarm never went off I'm sure it's not user error, as I made it a point o double check that I set both alarm A and B before I went to bed).There's only one thing an alarm needs to do... wake me up. It's tough for me to rely on this thing day in and day out."
1,Kept Gaining Time,"The clock slowly gained time. I would eventually notice and correct it when it was about 10 minutes faster than my other clocks. Unfortunately, it would happen every few months so I donated it. I hope someone else is having better luck with it."
2,Pass this one by,"It's sad that I can't buy the simplest of products without being upset. It seems so easy to get right, yet I'm disappointed.ProsNice large display with 3 level brightness settingDaylight Savings TimeBattery backupDual alarmConsBIG! This thing is a beast and will take up a good portion of your nightstand.Volume - The radio is plenty loud but I can easily see many people sleep through the standard -BEEP- alarm when it is at it's highest level.Complexity - I'm pretty well technically inclined but this is the first time I found myself dipping into the instruction manual to set an alarm clock. The separate knob to set each alarm adds to the complexity when it should just be incorporated into the buttons used to set the clock. The words labeling the all buttons are cluttered.UPDATE> I've dropped this down to 2 stars. The battery back-up has failed me twice so far and the alarm-off button is WAY too small. I'm going to see if its too late to return this."
2,Don't be misled!,"Don't be mislead: ""automatic time set"" doesn't mean that it uses the atomic clock to update the time. ""Automatic time set"" means they preset the time at the factory. The clock arrived with a time that differed seven minutes from the actual time (as displayed on an existing atomic clock), so you still need to set the clock and to periodically readjust the time."
1,Hate it,"After having this a while and just using it as back-up alarm... do not like it. With the white color and the options on the clock not colored in... just indented - practically impossible to see at night or in daylight. Too convoluted in its make-up.Battery d.o.a. - had to shell out for a new one. Would not buy again.The radio is so-so, but I use another radio for listening. Why, Sony, did not not make a better radio???"
5,Loud enough,"Easy to set up and use. Had no problem with the factory programmed time set(just list your time zone, and bingo your time is set). Other reviewers said that the sound was to low on the wake up alarm. I have mine set on low. Wakes me up every time. Then again, I do not go to bed drunk or on any sleeping aids. If you are healthy or average, the sound is more than capable of waking you up. Back up battery system works. Radio works great too. Very happy with product."
3,Preset Incorrectly,Clock arrives with a factory preset 3-minutes fast and it's difficult to override. Solution: adjust factory setting by depressing the (-) button while in the minute selection rather than attempting to enter the current time manually.
1,Signal strength is VERY low - beware!,"I had a Dream Machine from the 80's that I used until it kicked the bucket this year. I bought this alarm clock in April because I liked my old one, and because of the price and the good reviews.I don't know if it's because of where I live (a row home in Philadelphia) but I can only get a few stations clearly on this radio. It's really frustrating. I like to listen to news in the morning, but I can't get the NPR station clearly--it goes in and out and has a lot of static.Sony needs to figure out if this is a problem with the product and fix it, otherwise it's not really a clock ""radio."" I'd think about this before purchasing the product!"
1,Poor quality,"I have 2 Sony alarm clock radios that are still working after 20 years. However, NOT this model. The time set buttons no longer work only after 2.5 years! The reception has much static so I am very glad to be rid of this lemon."
2,Sony digital clock,I am very disappointed with this clock because it can't be adjusted to the exact correct time. It is actually 3 minutes fast the exact time. This problem should have been disclosed.
3,creepy!,on more than one occassion my alarm has went off without it even being plugged in... its probably just a manufactures defect but its still scary =/
3,Bad sound quality,"All things considered this radio does everything advertised, but the problem is, for a radio, the speaker quality is absolutely lousy.....that's the thing one would think they would pay at least some attention to when they put it together. Also, the tuning knob and volume knob are on the side and are very, very touchy. Minor movement of the tuning knob wreaks havoc with the reception of a station. Very annoying. Other than those things, good enough for the good price."
3,hard to set time and date,"It is very confusing how to set the time and date. Unless you get through the steps very quickly, the system locks. I don't understand why SONY would change the setting from older models which had separate hour and minute features. The manual instructions are not very user friendly and I'm still uncertain about how to set the date. The time and date setting should be separate functions on the unit.The plastic is kind of cheap looking, but the digital display is pretty easy to read and the reception seems OK. Overall, I'm disappointed in SONY because I have been satisfied with their products in the past."
2,"Good clock, just not loud enough","I bought this clock at Target for about $16. It looks nice, very easy to set up and set the alarms. My only issue was that the buzzer is *extremely* quiet! I never tried out the radio (I don't like to wake up to the morning DJ's yelling) so I just stuck with the buzzer. As it turns out, the alarm on my iPhone is louder than this clock. For this reason only I had to return it.If you prefer the radio to a buzzer, this might be a good choice, otherwise I'd look for something else."
4,bright and easy to read,I needed a replacement and something that I could see during the night. This clock has a nice bright( adjustable)display and easy to see. The two alarms are great to have. The sound is ok but you cannot expect HiFi quality.The self-setting is a nice feature too.
4,An easy to use autonmatic clock,"I'm retired, so I really don't need the alarm feature or the sound quality of the clock. When you retire, time becomes relatively unimportant and only needed to keep appointments, etc. But, I have hated having to go around my house and adjust all the clocks when DST changed or after a brief power outage. Now, it's a snap with this clock. I don't have to do anything.The clock was easy to setup right out of the box. The time was off by a minute or two on each of the two clocks I purchased. The date on one was correct and off by two days on the other. But, setting both the time correctly and the date correctly are made easy by the one manual function button on this clock. Now, they both are all set.The tiny button backup battery in this clock ought to give a few years of hands-free service to the batteries.For me, this clock is perfect for my needs."
3,Always off by 30 seconds ot so,"I bought this for my 8-year old daughter. Though she quickly learned how to set up the alarms and is happy with it, I am not as happy because it's always about 30 seconds off another atomic clock in her room that is verified to be no more than a few seconds off the time standard. I wish it were a bit more accurate..."
4,Nice little clock,"This little clock has a dual alarm feature, which is easy to set and convenient to use. All of it is very intuitive. The snooze button can be pushed multiple times to increase snooze time. The brightness level can be adjusted. The alarm has a buzzer or radio option. The radio is as good as any radio clock I've ever owned.My favorite part, and the reason I bought it, is that it resets itself whenever the power goes out; and I can just plug and go, no need to set it. The only problem I have with that feature right now is when they moved the day Daylight Savings Time starts and ends. My clock is set with the old standard start and end dates and this clock doesn't know that, so I have to spend an entire week with the clock time set an hour off. I can adjust the time and try and remember to adjust it again at the end of the week or else just try and remember to adjust it in my head. Not a big deal to suffer once in a long while. For the price and all its nifty features, it is worth it."
4,Worth it,"After searching and researching for quite some time I decided to go for this one as my alarm clock. Till now it has performed well to my expectation. Pros are 2 different alarm setup with option for buzzer or radio alarm, clear display, battery backup so that power outage don't require setting up the entire thing again. Cons for me is manual radio search. It is difficult to change from 96.3 to 97.1 FM. Reception too is low if put deep into the house. But overall this has been a good buy for me and my son loves it too."
5,Sony Alarm Clock,"Clock was pretty much right on out of the box. It was easy to setup and use. I really like it a lot. The buzzer isn't as brutal as some alarm clocks, it is actually pleasant to listen to.I would recommend this alarm. Enjoy."
5,Fantastic alarm clock!,I bought this alarm clock for my daughter and she loves it. Very easy to use and well designed. Sony has really done a great job designing everything so that it is simple to setup and use. It would be nice if it had an MP3 connection but for the price that is probably asking to much.
5,Sony Clock Radio,I bought this for my dad for Christmas. He really likes it because of the large numbers and the fact that the clock is automatically set to the correct time. You only have to correct the time if you live in a different time zone.
1,Automatic Clock,"This clock is worthless. Right now it is running 1/2 ahead of time. And when the time changes, it doesn't set the time right. Will not buy again."
3,Not good.,"This radio does work, just not very well. The antenna is in the cord and loses its signal every time I move away from it. No adjustment on the cord/antenna works, signal is still lost and lots of static."
2,There are better clocks around for the price,"The sony alarm clock is not what I was expecting when I ordered the clock. The automatic time was not accurate and had to be reset. However, after a few adjustments the Sony clock was ready to go and has a large display that is easy to read.Setting the alarms on the clock radio was a little awkward at first, but after playing with the knobs for a while it was relatively simple to use. The alarm on the clock is my main concern/problem with the Sony. The ""buzzer"" is not loud at all and will not wake a heavy sleeper. It starts off low and gradually gets louder, but it is a beeping sound instead of a buzz.IF you are a light sleeper this clock radio will work for you, but if you need something that is loud I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,The Sony Clock,This clock is nice if you dont like the alarm being loud enough to awake you. I feel it was a waste of my money and i never knew any alarm clock could be so low in noise.
3,"Easty to see, but the backup battery system doesn't work","The clock is easy to see, what I really wanted, but unfortunately the backup system that should keep time when the power goes out doesn't work, even after trying a couple brand new batteries."
3,"Great!! But only ONE of the Alarm Clock's work, (B).","(A) no matter what I do (A) always goes back to 12:00am..So I could never set the time other than to 12:00am on (A)When I set the Alarm (B) it stays and works for whatever timeI set it in the morning, when I set Alarm (A), then rotateto buzzer or radio, it's reset to 12:00am (default)and stays there.The result is I have a great Clock/Radio Alarm unit, butwith only 1 time setting, (B); I mean, aren't these things TESTED?We're talking SONY over here!Hec."
2,Alarm buzzer volume way too low!,"Alarm buzzer volume way too low for anyone to use as an alarm clock unless you can wake up via a radio function! Other than this, everything else is great."
4,Like the clock,"Replacement for the same clock that finally quit working after many years of use. However, my first one had to have the time set. This one has an automatic time set but it isn't keeping very good time. It's now running almost ten minutes fast with no controls to reset it. Otherwise, I like the clock. I guess it's better to be too fast than to be too slow!!!!!"
2,Sony ICF-C318,The functions are easy to use and the Alarm function works very well. The major disappointment is the sound quality and reception which are both very poor.
5,Small but mighty.,This clock radio is small but does not lack in features. The time display is perfect and the dual alarms are exactly what I require.
5,Good clock radio,This clock radio is great. I use it in my bathroom and turn on the radio while I am in the shower or getting ready for work in the morning. The price was good and I am pleased. I will be using this item for many years to come (hopefully).
3,Sony ICF-C318 Automatic Time Set Radio,"We are pleased with the little radio. I needed a clock on my side of the bed and it may as well have an alarm and radio with it. It is small (good) so the sound is small also, but o.k. It also is good at setting the time itself. I accidentally unplugged it the other day and was too lazy to get the plug out behind the bed headbord. It still had a few low beeps at the time the alarm should have gone on. We are pleased with our purchase. We purchased this at Amazon and received it promptly."
5,Great Clock,"Bought this clock because of the features. It lives up to every one. Easy to use. I selected the time zone and bam, there was my time zone, no extra need to set the clock. Now that daylight savings is coming up, all I have to do is press the button before I go to bed and the time is changed. No need to worry about messing with the time. Great product for the price. Would buy over and over again and I am not a big Sony fan. Kudos to Sony on this one."
1,NOT LOUD AT ALL!!,I am a super heavy sleeper and bought this thing cause i saw reviews saying it was loud. HA! I've had it for almost two weeks now and had to go back to using my phone for an alarm which isn't reliable either. I've never heard this alarm and it has yet to wake me up. Big mistake!!! Only buy if your super light sleeper
2,The clock that doesn't keep time.,The time automatically set is always wrong and when you set it yourself it looses about 30 seconds a day. Its not very loud but the display is great.
5,Good Alarm Clock for College,"The dual alarm system is good, since my classes are blocked and I have to wake up at two different times depending on the day. The radio is loud enough that I can wake up to it with ear plugs on. The design is nice and changing the alarm time is pretty easy with the knobs on the side. Radio is pretty good quality too. Overall, a pretty good alarm clock. The only thing I don't like about it is the snooze time - 10 mins."
2,Seek an alternative,"I bought this clock solely because my old one bit the dust and this one seemed to have the best reviews for the price. Mistake!The worst thing about it is the snooze function. If you don't press it exactly the right way (two taps, I believe), the snooze time gets longer with each press (e.g., 10 min, 20 min, etc.). Who thinks about how they are pressing their snooze button at the moment they've just woken up? Not me. If I hadn't had a backup alarm on my phone just in case, I would have been late.What else... The buzzer/beeper sound option is much too quiet on even its loudest setting. The radio is a sufficient volume, so why isn't the buzzer?And the LED display can only be dimmed to a certain extent. The display does not have any automatic hide/turn off function. I had to point the screen away from me so it wouldn't keep me awake.Also, the thing is a behemoth and takes up way too much room on a nightstand.All in all, not the right choice."
1,Stopped working,I really loved this clock because it is difficult finding a white clock. After a couple of months all the clock would do was flash 12:00. I replaced the battery thinking that was the problem. But now all it does is flash what appears to be 12:64 with parts of the number missing. Very dissapointed
4,sony ifc-c318,"great little alarm radio - not as tinny as some radios, decent sound - compact and easy to use"
2,"Good for getting started w/ J2EE, BUT TOO MANY ERRORS","I've often seen complaints about O'Reilly's editing in reviews like this. Now I know what all those folks are complaining about. The diagrams and examples in this book are just plain *BAD*. In the section on DB design I don't think there wasn't one ER diagram with out MULTIPLE errors. Where's the quality control? I would have given 4 stars if the diagrams and examples were corrct.The textual content of the book is actually pretty good, easy to read, but a little slow paced for me. I was initially attracted to the book because of it's promise of bringing multiple J2EE concepts toghether in one read. I'm afraid tho that if I'm left to analyzing and correcting errors in areas that I'm familiar with that I'll be very confused and frustrated by errors in areas I'm not so familar with.I will certainly scrutinize the next two volumes in the series much more closely before I consider buying."
4,pretty good!,"After releasing a live concert DVD of the flamingos album and a live cd after the pequeno album, i figured what is the point to release another live CD/DVD!?But i was wrong as this ""freak show"" combo is pretty damn good. The live CD focuses mainly on the ""el viaje a ninguna parte"" album with additional tracks such as a Bushido song and a contribution from singer Mercedes ferrer. The only old songs you'll find here are salome, sacame de aqui, and y al final.The opening intro ""otto mezzo"" is very cool. It reminded me a lot of Fellini's film 8 1/2. If you've seen it then you'll understand why.The DVD is not precisely a concert performance. It's more of a film documentary with footage of the preparation for this unique circus tour. It is interesting to watch but I'd say this is more for the hardcore Bunbury fans. What saves it is when some of the songs are finally performed live.This is a nice thing to have."
3,"Good Dvd, bad cd.","the dvd is great, you won't see a concert, it's just a documentary about the freak show tour, it is pretty cool if you are a die hard fan of bunbury. in the other hand, the cd is SUCKS!...they picked up the wrong songs to build this cd. there is only few good songs from the last bunbury's cd. Before you buy it, take a look to the track listing then buy it."
3,One-Sided cherry-picking of lines...,"This book is OK, but the Alapin is an iffy line anyway, so there is only so much you can expect from a book on an iffy line. I play a system that robs the Alapin of much (if not all) of it's point, and my analysis has been published on more than one reputable website and validated by a Grandmaster who is a recognized authority on the French Defense (but I'm not writing a book, so I don't have to reveal any secrets...). My line, which is not difficult to find, is not covered, or even mentioned, in Sawyer's book."
5,good video,"I did get some good tips and ideas from this dvd, and immediately went to my machine to try them out. Watched it again a couple months later and then sold the used copy:-)"
5,Great DVD!,"Clear, concise instructions and great techniques. Ricky is a great teacher. I had the opportunity to see him at Quilt Camp in the Pines before he hit the big time. He puts on a wonderful, inspiring show. If you get the chance to see him in person I highly recommend it! This is a great DVD. Even though I've been quilting for ages it taught me some new tricks!"
1,It's just loose talk,Christians: don't waste your money.Non-christians and scientists: Read it and see what are you facing!
3,3 1/2 stars - pretty cool album,"Platinum Pied Pipers - Triple P (Ubiquity, 2005)If you liked DJ Jazzy Jeff's The Magnificent and Hidden Beach Recording's Hidden Hits Vol. 1, you'll like this album because it's the same kind of vibe going on here: dope beats, mellow grooves, decent performances. Also, similar to those albums, the main focus is on the work of producers Waajeed and Saadiq. In other words, don't expect no Aretha-type singing or Rakim-type rapping. The exceptions to the rule are the performances by singers Georgia and Tiombe Lockhart and rapper Invincible (who has a Jean Grae-esque flow). I'm looking forward to their albums in the future, as well as another one from the Platinum Pied Pipers.By the way, I'm feeling that ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" remake but I cringe at the songs where Jay Dee raps. Stick to producing, please. -EJR"
4,Decent end table,"I was satisfied with the quality of this table. It was heavy, solid wood construction. The only assembly required was to put the legs on. The color was just like the photo showed, a nice red-brown."
4,"Not perfect, but very enjoyable","I had a good time reading this book, and I think the authors came up with some very convincing arguments. I disagree with them on some things -- for instance, although I'm a born-again Christian I have no problem with evolution. But I don't expect to agree with everything in a book, and there's no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater. (What a horrible image that is!)"
1,Not a very compelling book,This book just doesn't give me the ammo I need to defend Christianty. I realize it isn't meant to be too deep but it doesn't do a good summary job either.
4,Good Basic Apologetics For High Schoolers,"If you are trying to find a good primer for apologetics for your youth ministry, this is THE book. In simple language, McDowell explains many of the myths about Christianity. The chapters on the person of Christ are particularly exceptional. Through chapters like, ""Is God A Vending Machine"" and ""Plastic Jesus"" the credibility of the claims of Christ and who He is as a whole person are explored. If you want to challenge your teens to understand their faitha s they live it, this is the book to buy."
3,"Not an in-depth book, but good for what it is","The point of this book is to help Christian teens determine ""what should I believe and why."" Forty-two short chapters of 3-4 pages each discuss various aspects of God, Jesus, the Bible, and the Christian life, comparing a popularly held ""myth"" with Scriptural and logical evidence to the contrary.None of the topics are covered with much depth, so don't look here for a masterpiece of Christian apologetics. This would probably be okay as a basic introduction to the Christian faith for younger teenagers, but I think it would function better as a ""jumping off"" point for guided group discussion with a leader who can cover the topics more thoroughly."
3,Good Information,"In that this was written in 1999, and this is now 2003 - thisbook IS well written for anyone that wants to attempt phototransfer. I've done considerable research on this, read far toomany articles with conflicting information on the process, attempted too many techniques with poor results.This is exactly as intended - a handbook, it compares the various techniques with results.Many resources now have websites and there are more products on the market. The biggest hurdle between 1999 and 2003 is the digital camera and the advancement of computers and printers. So with today's technology and computer saavy, photo transfer can easily be done and this book is a useful tool for reference and guidelines."
1,"Way out of date, and in questionable taste","I purchased this book used (thank goodness!) to find out ways to transfer photos to fabric for wall hangings to use as gifts. The methods are very out of date and the information is no longer viable in some instances. I expected more in the way of detailed how-to information and it doesn't suit my needs at all. Also, it is chock full of things that someone may consider art, but only has meaning to the 'artist', and is not a book I could let my child sit and look at. Its ok to buy from the $1 bin, but is definately not a 'keeper' book."
1,Too Crafty!,I purchased this book in the hope of discovering a new way of transferring computer-generated line drawings or pictures onto cloth in order to then embroider the images. I had experimented with two types of computer transfer papers and found them totally unsatisfactory for my needs (stitching on rubberized fabric is not my idea of fine art). This book was simply filled with crafty ideas about what could be done with these unsatisfactorily transferred images ... something even worse than T-shirts. I think the rag dolls with photographs of people's faces said it all.
1,Too Crafty for Words!,"I purchased this book in the hope that I would discover a new way of transferring computer-generated line drawings or pictures to cloth in order to then embroider the images.

I think the rag dolls with photographs of people's faces said it all. Yuck! If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have!"
3,Proverbs and Common Sayings from the Chinese,"I would recommend this book to a person who can recognize at least 1,000 Chinese characters, for familiarity with characters is necessary for a smooth reading of the explanation of the proverbs. This book wasn't written as I expected, in that the author presents and translates proverbs in paragraph form . . . there must be thousands of proverbs in here! However, reading this book is a good practice not only in becoming more adept at character recognition but also in Chinese culture. The author emphasizes the influence of culture upon language and vice versa; however, the deficiency of detail in the explanations causes the reader to draw her own 'pictures' and 'stories' in interpreting. Ultimately, I read this book for as much the character-reading practice as the proverb-learning. (The author translates each Chinese proverb into English, but does not always give the pronunciation of each character.)"
4,A light uncomplicated read.,"I have recenlty found to my suprise that many YA novels are very interesting. The ""Young Jedi Knights"" series have a lot of these novels and this particular book is easily representative of the breed. It helped that I have read some of the previous books of the series, however, otherwise I would have been completely lost in the character interrelationships."
5,This book was GREAT!!!,"There were some things wrong (Luke called his sister ""Chief of State Organa Solo"" instead of just ""Leia""), but Jacen and Tenel Ka got closer. Zekk and Jaina got boring, and the friend should've GRABBED THE BLASTERS! They could've killed Hovrak right away had they gotten those! But anyway it was great, and I can't wait to get The Emperor's Plague!"
3,Two Fat Ladies Obsessions,"Many of the same recipes are in ""cooking with Two Fat Ladies"". Interesting to read, but I don't think many Americans would actually prepare any of the recipes. I love the videos, the cookbooks don't have the same charm."
4,Strong Foundation,"This book gives a strong foundation on the basics of human oriented research with simple, but useful explainations of all the major concepts. The part where it is lacking is in the statistical analysis which is definitely not like the rest of the book. While the basic concpts of statistics use in research is covered, a more thorough explaination and inclusion of examples would have been useful. However, in spite of this, I would still highly recommend this book to anyone beginning their studies in clinical or human based research."
4,Good for kids knees.,We were looking for something to put at the top of the ladder on our wooden playset so our kids (2 and 4 years) wouldn't get splinters as they were climbing onto the top deck. This tape is soft enough that it doesn't hurt their sensitive skin. We just put the tape on a couple days ago and I'm hoping it will stick for a long time.
2,Not very durable,I used this on a childs bunk bed ladder. It was great until my 2yo son got into the room. I loved the soft but grippy tape and it was nearly clear but my 2yo had it all off in 20 minutes flat! I had such high hopes for this product.
2,not TDK,"These are only TDK branded, made by Daxon. Media code Daxon AZ3. Those expecting TDK quality, prepare to be let down. I've had better luck with HP and CompUSA branded media."
3,Arrived with damaged packaging,"I purchased this for my uncle for Christmas. He told me the package arrived with the top of the plastic packaging all cracked up. Seems that there was no damage to the DVDs themselves, but it certainly takes away from the positive impression and general level of satisfaction when the product comes in that condition."
1,A bought lesson,"I normally do extensive research before I purchase anything. I guess I didn't research enough before I bought these discs. Half of them have failed. Some worked for a while and then failed, others never got out of the starting gate. I have one of the best DVD players made so the machine was not the problem. To be fair, further research suggested that I should have used DVD-R instead of +R. After wasting 20 bucks I did some more digging and discovered a brand called 'Taiyo Yuden' as most recommended. I saw that Amazon does sell these and I'm glad because I'd never heard of them. I also read that when burning a disc no other programs should be running. The TDK discs are continuing to fail little by little. I will try the other brand next time and be more careful when burning."
1,"20 % FAILURE Rate, What happened to the quality that tdk USED to be?","TDK USED to be good stuff. I bought a 100 Pack July 2009, About 1 in 5 will NOT burn (even made me think there may have been a problem with my burners), and the further down the pack, the higher the failure rate.I gave up on wasting my time with these with about 20 left in the pack.I used El Cheapo Fry's GQ brand that worked great until they stopped selling them, tried these TDK garbage until I couldn't stand the wasted time any more. Now using Phillips brand without a dud yet. Also HP branded worked well, just not TDK.So many well known Brands that HAD good reputations have gone bad, (Kingston is another) you just cannot rely on any ratings over a few month old now.DO NOT BUY THESE, TDK is no longer a good quality product."
1,Worst DVD's that I have ever brought,"These are the worst DVD's that i have used ever. Every alternate DVD I wrote is not working properly, it shows me that copying data has done sucessfully but when I try to openI have been using RIADATA & nextech from long time and have never faced this problem.I will never go for TDK once again.ThanksKSG"
1,Never again,"I have used TDK disks for many years. Not any more.This stack of DVD's simply does not work. I have two DVD burners, and I have troubleburning on both of them with these DVD's. In fact, I have made 19 coasters so far.Out of 19 tries. That's a pretty dismal record."
1,Horrible media,I have written thousands of DVD and these are the worst. TDK was a good brand at one time but DO NOT TRUST THESE DVDs.
1,TDK DVD+R Horrible Discs,"I have personally been backing up my movies collection and burning them to discs as DVD data discs so I can save them as .avi files, allowing me to put like 5 movies on one disc. I have never had a problem with the first 50 discs I burned onto which were Sony and Maxell...I bought these discs thinking I could save a little money and instead I find out that the only thing that will read these discs now is my XBOX 360...My own computer can't even read these discs properly. It shows they have data on them but when I open the disc file it's empty...nothing..."
3,Average Quality,"Still throwing a few of these out, but much better than most brands that I've bought in the past."
2,Watch out for shipping charges,"It appears that Amazon is no longer directly stocking these DVDs. If you do decide to order them from the vendor above, watch out for the exorbitant shipping charge which no longer makes these discs a bargain."
1,DO NOT BUY,These discs are amoung the worst I have used. I get an error from 3 to 4 out of five. The ones that do record play fine.
1,SUCK,These DVD discs SUCK! They don't work at all. They won't burn anything.TDK 16X DVD+R 100PK SpindleDO NOT BUY!!!
4,first 100 great second 100 about 30 bad ons in it,first stack I used was great all burnt prefect but the second batch of 100 about 30 wouldn't burn correctly
3,TDK DVD 100PK Spindle,Packaging was HORRIBLE. Spindle was broken open and the center shaft was broken off the base so DVD all over the box. So far all I have tried work but Amazon needs to package this product better.
3,Shipping this item seems to be a problem with Amazon,"I mean, take a small box and fill it with the spindle and put a few paper cushions right? No. Amazon puts it into a huge box with 100 air pockets that all break because of the weight. Twice I ordered this, and twice I returned it because the packaging sucks. What I received was a big broken mess and had to return it to the post office. Never again."
4,A very good multipurpose disc,"Received Ritek made discs on this spindle. Not much to say, these are a very good multipurpose disc; be it games, movies, music, whatever. Anyone who has problems with these are either too picky, just don't know what they're doing or they own crappy equipment."
1,50% Failure Rate,"these blank dvd+r are cheap and they suck it takes me 2-3 attempts to copy a movie onto them. i am using nero 7 premium, dvd fab platinum and dvd shrink to burn my dvds with i have two HP DVD burners 16x, and i have used sony 16x blank dvds and HP 16x blank dvd's and no problem what so ever. I get the TDK and burn process fails until 2nd or 3rd attempt i will never buy another TDK product again, nor would i suggest whomever is reading this."
2,OKDissapointing results,"I purchased these disks expecting I was getting a good price. Unfortunately, these disks had a high failure rate when I tried to burn them on my PC DVD burner (at least half had burn errors). I thought the problem might be in my burner so I tried it with two others and still wasted about half. They seem to record without problems on my DVD recorder, but I have only tried a few so far. I used another brands (Sony, etc.) and they work fine on my PC."
2,DVD +R,"DVD +R is not a common format. I can format them and save stuff on them, but I have trouble finding other devices that can read them.Shannon"
4,they work well...,"I haven't had any bad burns so far - my only gripe is that the edges of the discs aren't smooth. No big deal, just bugs me a little. Otherwise, they're great. I like the gray surface."
1,this is very unfair,"first i read some of the reviews, but since i had good luck with the first 100 dvd's i purchase from amazon, well you can imagen what happend, i bought another 100 and im very sorry, so far y have a defect ratio of 50%, this means i burn 8 disc and got 4 costers, stay away from this product, also the real manufacturer of my batch is ""DAXON"", wich i dont know if whe can sue somebody, i tought i bought tdk, but not, im very disopointed, also amazon should so something about this, in other countries, they put the name of the manufacturer also, you actually know what your getting, for example, the brand states Verbatim but the are manufacturer by Taiyo, and you know this before you make the purchase, this kind of poor management is what kills companys.fallow up: testing at diferent speeds i found out they work great at half speed (8x) and it takes arround 6 or 7 minutes to burn, wich is not badjust in case somebody else has the same problem, you can try burning at a lower speed"
1,"Only compatible with some drives, at low speeds.","Although the box says TDK, as someody else mentioned, the manufacturer is Ritek. First 2 discs in the Pioneer drive from my laptop produced coasters. The maximum write speed accepted was 2.4x, although the drive itself is much faster and works very well with other brands. The resulting discs would not play in any DVD drive I tried.I then tried to write a third disc on an external Toshiba drive, which routinely writes other discs at 8x, and I got a whopping 4x write speed with the ""TDK"". At least the Toshiba produced a disc that was readable in other drives.If you are lucky and your drive is compatible with these discs, fine, if not, you get coasters."
1,Quality Is Not A Factor Here,"I heard how TDK and Verbatim were the cream of the crop, so I got these. While people are right that you don't get a lot of coasters the problem is that only a dvd drive on a computer is going to read them if burned at a decent speed. When burning at 6x (slowest setting on my 16x burner) my PS2,XBOX, and three dvd players have had a very hard time reading from these discs. I bought some Sony +r that are 1x-8x since they were cheap and at my local Wal Mart, they shame TDK. I've tried many of the cheaper brands such as HP, Memorex, KHypermedia,Sony, and Phillips (can't remember others now) and only Memorex was worse than TDK. I will stick to Sony and/or Phillips; never a problem with Sony and minimal with Phillips."
1,DVD doesn't work well with Nero 6.,"Burned some videos w/ Nero & the DVD's burned successfully. Once I played them, some played a few minutes, the others didn't even work.Had the burn the videos again w/ Roxio at a much slower speed. The cheap Velocity DVD's are much better and more compatible w/many programs."
2,Broken case,"I am highly satisfied with the DVD's themselves and the value I paid for them. But there must have been a substandard quality of packing it because when it arrived, I saw the spindle case (or cakebox) broken. Next time, please pack it better so it won't get broken in the shipping. Thank you."
1,RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!,Just bought a spindle of 100. Tried to burn a DVD in iDVD on my Mac Pro. I tried eight disks. None were recognized at all. I stopped there and got a RMA from the vendor. Previously I purchased the Memorex ten pack that came with jewel cases and every one of them burned perfectly. I even ran my Alsop lens cleaner -- no difference. Some find these good. I didn't.
4,GREAT PRICE FOR A GOOD PRODUCT,I have used these DVD+R blanks for 2 weeks now and so far all blanks have recorded my projects without any problems or deffective disks.100 discs is a lot to go through - I hope all disks are of the same good quality by the end of the spindle! I am really pleased and truly recommend this brand. A really great item for the price. Thank you again Amazon!
3,Eh,"Good price, but I also experienced a high failure rate at first. This seems to have been corrected by writing at a much lower speed- 4X or 6X. If you are burning discs just fine, but they won't play- try that."
1,Worst DVD media I've ever used w/80% FAILURE,"RECORDER: LiteOn LVW-5005 Replaced twice, believing the problem was with the recorder.RECORDER: LiteOn LVC-9015g just received 5/7/07 and again, media failure reports, NOT one records with this TDK media, and we are talking the use of 17 pieces of media.Conclusion: DO NOT PURCHASE - TDK Electronics DVD+R47FCB100 Single-Sided 16x DVD+R Spindle, 100 Discs (Purchased on 03/10/2007)"
3,for the most....,Digital breakup for the most part has been very minimal. AUDIO storage has been no problem. Overall I give this product a 3 star rating in overall performance.
5,Good Disc - Good Price....,I like them not one coster in the lot. They seem to not scratch easy either. There is lots of room to write as well. My only two down sides are:1. No lines on disc to aid us old folk in keeping things straight and neat.2. The spindle screws on and if not exact will come of when picking up.I even like the Columbia Blue of the disc. Once more very happy.
