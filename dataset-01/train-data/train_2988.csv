3,Back Pain Imminent,"The workout was 40 min, but much was spent on your back with your weight resting on your tailbone, which I found quite painful. You really need good abs to safely do all these exercises! Definitely for more fit and advanced Pilates users."
4,They may be strange but they are enjoyable...,"traveling companions. Ziggurat makes it worth the purchase, When Planets Collide, Counting Cats in Zanzibar etc. are icing on the cake."
4,Not for the Faint of Heart,It may be difficult for religious types to swallow. This book is focused at pulling your head out of those holes and looking directly at the sun. Krishnamurti has a tendancy to use words in a manner that can be difficult to understand. He repeats himself quite often. He never answers the questions he is asked (not the way one wants them to be answered anyway). A briliant man with the power to bring minds into another dimension. Don't believe anything he says. Just listen and understand what he says.
2,Is Freedom A Final Event In Time?,"This collection was put together years after his death. The title is perhaps a bit misleading. Is it really essential K? Is it all one needs to read to capture what this guy talked about in 60+ years? Is it a good first reading?There's also a fundamental issue with the title ""Total Freedom"". It's a misleading title which may imply the traditional conditioned notion that Freedom is a final event in time. That is not the case. As a young friend recently said, people like the idea of freedom being a final event because they're lazy and want a guarantee for the future!Anyway, it is important to not believe what K says. Question everything and find out for yourself if there's truth in it -- then it's first hand truth and not so because he said it. And by the same token, if you find something he says to not be true, you can discard it."
1,These Don't Work,I haven't found one in-line amplifier that works yet. Do it right and get an amplifier that requires external power. Don't waste your money on this.
3,"Most comfortable headphones, but with defective issue","These are some of the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. I love Bose and I always recommend and sell their headphones to my family and friends. However, this is my second pair of Bose headphones that have fallen apart just from normal wear and tear and become unusable. The plastic chip that keeps the ear cup on the band just snapped off while I was reading a book and listening to light classical music on the airplane. I have never taken these headphones anywhere, and listen to music on them occasionally three times a week. Just be aware! You might need to buy a new pair after the first year, as this is a VERY COMMON issue it seems. As a note, Bose support offers a replacement set for $60(+tax), but this is an issue that would be very easy for Bose to fix and yet they delay because they make more money when their customers need to spend a $60 yearly fee to keep re-buying their headphones. I will NEVER recommend Bose to anyone again."
3,sound nice but flimsy,"These sound great and are very comfortable. Unfortunately, they are kind of flimsy, especially around the ear pieces. Mine came apart and will not stay intact any more... every time I take them off, the left earcup falls out. still sound nice but a pain to ""put together"" every time I use them.should come with a sticker: Some Re-Assembly required"
5,Excellent for the price,"These are light-weight, comfortable and sounds amazing. They don't have the QuietComfort technology built in, but still muffle outside sounds nicely. In my opinion, the QC technology (which I also own) reduce the quality of audio. IMHO, these actually have as good of audio quality as the $300 QC units. However, the QC's are build sturdier, with thicker ear foam. Also, If you are using an iPod, the power output on an ipod and other MP3 players may not be able to handle extra bass settings.If you sit at a computer and move around alot, I would recommend getting an audio extension cable. This will allow you to be more mobile, as well as preventing the unexpected ripping of headphones from your head, which causes the headphones to fall apart. Since adding the extension cable, I have used mine for 2 years, with no accidents."
1,Why buy Bose?,"I listened to these at a retail store and was appalled by the sound quality these things put out. The bass was boomy (probably has something to do with how they designed the closed back) and there seemed to be something missing from the upper lows and lower mids.For the amount of money a person might spend on these headphones they could get some very nice Sennheisers or even Grados (depending on if you're OK with an open back design). Heck, Koss Portapros, albeit they're uglier than sin, would probably be a better choice.In fact, let me give you a little advice. You're probably looking at these because you're just a random joe blow type who wants more sound out of his iPod. Right? Well then you should probably buy either Sony Fontopias (if you like the speakers that go in your little ear hole) or get some Sennheisers if you like over the ear joints."
1,Overpriced...overpriced...overpriced...,"Ok, I have had this pair of headphones for 2+ years. I have to disagree with some people saying the build quality is horrible. I havent had any problem with the headphones in that department. The only thing I replaced on it were the ear cushions. But i think the reason people buy this headphones is because ""it sounds so nice."" I was in the same boat and got suckered into buying this at the Bose store [...] Boy was I stupid. I bought another pair of sony dj monitor headphones (MDR-V700DJ) for my turntables and i found that the sony sounds WAY better than the bose and it is half the price. The sony has better bass, way better mids (bose doesnt have any) and good highs. I would not buy this pair of headphones for any reason or recommend anybody else to buy it. I would strongly recommend you to buy a good pair of sony."
3,Pleased But Puzzled,"I love the sound these headphones provide. I live in an apartment building. I like to watch television and DVD's until 1 a.m. I listen with headphones, so I don't annoy my neighbors. These provide the closest thing to surround sound I have found.Unfortunately I had to replace them after about 3 years, because they fell apart. First the padding came out because the vinyl came unstiched. I tolerated this until one earphone came completely apart. I have owned other headphones that lasted much longer. I am mystified. How could Bose make headphones with such great sound and such lousy quality?"
2,save your money,"I bought these... against my better judgement. You will pay for the name and that's it. They are good headphones... but you can get better for less money. I tried these for about two weeks, i was fine with how they sounded... but that was it. They don't fold, they are ugly, they look cheap... take a peek inside the earphone. I bought a pair of Sony MDR-V6 for much less...about $60, less and they are superior in every way... from packaging-sound quality."
1,Expensive fix for a piece of plastic,"Like several others, I enjoyed these until the plastic connections on the headband broke. Bose tells me they can't sell me a new headband, but can replace the whole unit for $60. I think I'll invest in something else, rather than risk a repeat failure in a few months, as others have reported."
5,a worthy product...,"$150 for a headphone may not sound like intelligent spending, but for Bose quality - you wont feel sorry later.Three years back when I researched on headphones, Bose stood first except for this one negative point. Headphone is fragile - Broke when I opened the FedEx box - similar reviews.But, I have been using this all these three years - really much; went to school, travel a lot, work in New York City and it is just fine. Of course, it needs care - you cant put in your backpack just like that - but definitely is not at all bad.Here is why Bose still remains my favorite.Deep Music (Not just loud) and Light weight (Very first time, it took 4 hours to realize that theres something on my head)"
4,"great sound, could be better fit","of course it has the best sound. and it muffles other sounds nicely.BUT it pushes my earrings into my head because it fits so tightly (and I have a small head). I have to tuck my small hoops in or I ache...worth the price, yes if you are picky about sound quality. If you do not know good quality, save money"
4,Great Sound..but build flaws,"While I read most people either have the cord break at the cups or the plastic piece holding the cups mine actually freyed off at the stereo plug.The problem is the cord is simply too long, I used rubberbands to make the cord shorter but it'd still get caught on everything even though the cord was ran inside my shirt instead of outside. It took plenty of tugs and pulls before the end finally gave in.Yes they are pricey but the sound is excellent. If they'd make one with a shorter cord I'd gladly buy another set..but until then I'm not spending so much on head phones."
2,"Great sound, but they broke","These are comfortable to wear and the sound is great, but they are not of high quality construction. Mine lasted approximately a year and a half before snapping near the ear cover. There are similar complaints all over the web. For a $130-140 price tag, I would expect them to last significantly longer. It is definitely disappointing as I remember the pain when I dished out the money. I would avoid these unless you are into disposable headsets."
5,Excellent,"I have had these headphones for over 2 years now and use them almost daily. I have never had any type of issue with them. The sound is great. I do admit that if I wear them too long (about 2 hours) they start making my ears feel tender. Not inside the ear but the ear itself, especially the ear lobe due to pierced stud earrings. I definitely recommend this product."
1,Just terrible,"I had the Tp-1a for less than a year. The sound was decent, but then they stopped working completely one day. I treated them with care, I mean who wouldn't they are Bose... the wiring by the headphone jack is very delicate and becomes flimsy, my guess is the wiring got messed up down there, but anyway yeah who wants a pair of headphones that can't even last a year.."
2,Built for comfort but not durability,"I'm on my third (and last) pair of the Tri-Port headphones. The sound is good and they are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. The problem is that they are fragile and cheaply made.My first two pair failed because the jack is a poorly made molded plastic item that can't stand even moderately heavy use. The wires inside the jack become disconnected and sound from one or both ears is lost. Bose replaced the first two pair (still under warranty) but the current pair has failed in the same way.Think twice about buying these headphones. If you ever remove and reinsert the jack on a regular basis, I guarantee that it will eventually fail."
3,Product Advertised is not what I received,"The product advertised by this supplier is not what I received. I received a lower quality model and received nothing but arguements from Amazon that I got what I asked for. Boses makes 3 styles in headphones in this category, AE which means Around Ear, OE which means Over Ear, and IE which means In Ear. The product advertised for sale was ""OE"" which is the most expensive, more durable and more compact. What I received was ""AE"" which is typically $30 to $40 less expensive. [[ASIN:[[ASB002LK2QJK Bose On-Ear HeadphonesIN:B002LK2QJK Bose On-Ear Headphones]]]]"
5,Great product for the price!,"Great product for the price. Even though it's not a noise cancellation headset, it does reduce a lot of background noise. Greate for airplane use. One negative thing was that it doesn't fold. It does come with a carrying case though."
4,overview of US anti-narcotics methods,"Whatever your views on narcotics usage, this book provides some of the base statistical data [from 2001-2] in the US. Describing US federal funding for drug interdiction, treatment and related topics. The book is mostly a compendium of appendices and tables. The textual accompaniment is fairly minimal.Keep in mind that the book came out in Feb 2002. At that time, a lot of the US federal attention was on the war on terrorism. Which included stopping terrorists entering the US. The drug interdiction methods described here probably were slightly deprecated because of the new emphasis."

4,"After His Death, A Father's Homosexuality is Revealed","This memoir is about a family that finds out, after their father'sdeath from AIDS in 1983, that he was gay and leading a double life.Ms. Bergman attempts to understand and forgive while reconciling herspiritual and ethical beliefs about life with her father's actions.Her father's homosexuality is only one of the ways he distanced him-self from his family. He was a huckster, opportunist and scam manin search of 'the great deal'.The book is interesting but a bit obtuse and postured. I recommendThe Family Heart: A Memoir of When Our Son Came Outin addition tothis book."
3,"Personal, yet distant in an ever constant growing weariness.","Anonimity's author is an intriguing woman who holds within her the angst of the lives lived by her family members. Her book is very personal, yet I feel that it does not bring us any closer to knowing the author in a true sense. It leaves me wanting her to scream out the anguish she holds inside and to break open her candy coated facade.Her writing is quite poetic, but it is lacking the area of self-discovery which causes her writing to feel smothered and tiresome."
2,Sad Story Badly Told,"Although my heart goes out to both of the Heche sisters and I have read both equally bad books I can not recommend either one of the books. I would however love to see a neutral party interview all the family members and friends of their father and the family to obtain a more coherent telling of the tale. It appears that Ann and Susan don't get along and neither one did much research in writing the book. Save your money for future tell alls by the Condits, Kennedys, Clintons, Ramsays, and OJ Simpsons."
3,Better then volume 1 but not that great,"In GFC Las Vegas Punishment the women are better looking and better trained than in the first installment,Beautiful Butchery. The first three matches are decent(the Liz vs Kissy match is my favorite). But after that, the long interviews and those two two minute rounds really grind the DVD to a halt. Six matches total:Gina vs Taslia, Kaila vs Kneilly, Liz vs Kissy, Rainbow vs Leslie, Rainbow vs Taslia, and Gina vs Leslie. Although Punishment wasn't horrible, if it had longer segments on the hotter women, shorter matches, and skimpier ring attire, it would've been a much better product."
5,Spectacular! One of the best albums of 2004...,"I loved the debut album from NYC's Baskervilles, and when I heard that Autoparty featured two Baskervilles members, I just knew I had to get this CD. Well -- the music does not disapoint! Every track is catchy and memorable, with clever lyrics and insteresting arrangements... This album fuses the best electronic music of the 80s with the coolest indiepop of today, and offers songs unlike what you've heard anywhere else... Trust me, you must hear this album! Amazingly cool artwork as well!"
1,selling his service,This book is totally empty of any useful concepts.Its just a way to promote Nassar's trading school.Get Master Swing Trader instead. The people giving this bookgood reviews are probably not traders or maybe areNassars friends.
5,OIL EATER,"I've used Oil Eater for years and it is absolutely essential in my shop. Amazon has the best price I've found. The product was delivered quickly and in good conditon. Well packaged against any damage.I most highly recommend use of Oil Eater and Amazon!BobCAP'N BOB'S BIKES, Inc."
3,"Pretty Good, But Some Changes Not For the Better","Overall, this is another good ""Franklin"" story. The plot is solid and there are some nice illustrations. Readers will also identify with a lot of Franklin's feelings, especially as he begins to reconsider his decision to run away. My only complaint about this story is the alterations made from the television episode. For one thing, Franklin's baby sister Harriet was not in the television show in this episode, but the writers have been editing her into the storybooks, most likely as an attempt to try and change the timeline to make it look like she was in the show all along. The other big mistake is that the original story featured the excellent character Snail in a major role, whereas in this story he only appears on one page and doesn't even speak."
2,Probably the biggest rip-off act to date,These guys kill me! How can they so blatantly rip off Rage Against The Machine and call it their own? They even stole Zach's lyrics! Riviere should have never singed these posers. Yikes...
5,"Pricey, but so worth it","Home Movies is my favorite cartoon and never fails to cheer me up when I need it. The Coach McGuirk tote is a bit tacky (kind of like a mini version of the cheap grocery bags they sell now), but other than that the presentation's cute and I'm sure I'll be enjoying this purchase for years to come."
5,ULTIMATE COLLECTION FOR A FAN!,This hands down the best way to buy this show! You get everything and sometimes you can get it for under $60
3,"Great product, poor packaging","I bought this knife as a wedding gift. Wusthof is a fabulous brand so I'm sure the knife is great, but it was obvious the the particular knife that I got has been returned and sent back out in it's original, torn packaging...which made it kind of embarrassing to give as a gift. I unfortunately didn't have time to exchange it before the wedding. I need to pay more attention if an item is shipped from Amazon or another retailer, because I have experienced problems like this in the past with non-Amazon retailers."
4,Good for the basics,"If your purpose is to become familiar with the basics of Java3D, and read what 3D in Java is all about, then you should buy this book, definately. But don't expect to find complex real-life examples. What you learn is truly just the basics. Intermediate or advanced topics are not covered. Just answers to questions like ""how do I setup a 3D environment?"", and ""how do I create a rotation?"" and things like that. If you browse the Java3D API, and see what else is possible, then you realize that it's really just the basics that is covered.But if the basics are your purpose, this is truly a jump-start, and it will definately suit your expectations."
3,A letdown from the Java3D team,"I am a 3d programmer for 3 years . I know the difference between directional lights and point lights, textures and mipmaps.I had read the complete Java3d spec and the tutorial by Sun and was expecting a bit more in this book. Unfortunately it is a big letdown in terms of such expectations.The book seems to have been written for a fresh programmer who doesnt have any knowledge of 3d concepts. There are also a few technical errors at the end in the PickTool class and OrbitBehavior class descriptions. Also Behavior concepts are not covered very well. If you have read the J3D specs and the tutorial by Dennis Bouvier, then there is no need to buy this book. If you are very fresh to 3d and in particular to Java3dthis book is a good introduction to the key concepts."
2,Not enough info,While the book has some good information. There are to many errors and huge holes in topic coverage. If you use this as your only source for the test you will fail unless you are a routing pro. I had to buy and read a 2nd book and was then able to pass on my first try.
3,Very Average...,"I havent taken the exam yet, but i have taken the Cisco BSCN course and have been over the courseware. The exam cram does OK up until the BGP sections...it then falls over badly. Without the benefit of the Cisco course/courseware i wouldn't have had a clue what he was talking about. Some of his BGP info was not even covered in the BSCN course. The other topics get an OK treatment.I am going to use the Courseware, Routing TCP/IP, Internet Routing Arch and a couple of other Cisco Press books + the Boson tests. I will still use the Exam Cram - but i won't be relying on it that much.Good Luck All!!!"
2,Insufficient to assist in passing test,"I took the Cisco official BSCN class, and without that and the supplied materials, would have failed the exam. There are very few options for self-study for this exam - even Cisco's book is not due out until next month. So, it's understandable that this Exam Cram misses the mark. The BSCN test hits heavily on BGP and EIGRP, which are weakly covered in the book. In general, the book seems to be guessing directions, given the fact that many components were pulled from ACRC and replaced with new material. I cannot recommend it at this point. Currently, the only place to get the info is Cisco's classes (expensive) and of course Boson's practice exams, which were invaluable."
5,Coriolis does it again!!!,The Routing Exam Cram Book is amoung the top of the line when it comes to preparing for a Cisco or any certification exam. I have always put my trust in the exam cram series and have yet to be failed.
2,Not at all complete,"I just finished this Exam with a passing grade. I used this book and the Sybex CCNP Routing Study Guide. This was by far one of the harder certification exams that I've taken and I have to honestly say that neither this book nor the Sybex book were really complete. There was a great deal of content on my test that simply wasn't covered in adequate detail in either of these books.All in all, I believe that if you study these books, you'll have a good foundation but, without some real world experience, I don't believe either of them, or both of them together for that matter, will provide everything you will need to pass the exam."
2,Not worth the money,"I found this book to lack depth and full of errors. I looked for an errata from Coriolis, but there wasn't one. This book has been out for awhile and I found it disappointing that the publisher was aware of the many errors and failed to put an errata out there on their web site."
2,"OK, but not what is needed.","The CD with this book has several errors and trying to registar it on line and get ""free"" updates just does not work. One would do much better to purchase BOSON practice tests from Geocerts.com. They are the way to go along with the Cisco Press book."
3,Desert Dweller,This book did a good job of explaining OSPF and EIGRP but was poor on BGP. When 10 out of the first 15 questions on the test were on BGP I knew my ship was sunk. Too many errors - especially in the examples where an error is the last thing you need. Better explanation of BGP is needed.
4,Good but not great...,"As with all the Exam Cram books...this one is full of information that is not covered in the Sybex study guide (ex. passive interfaces).The book does have typos in it, but they are very obvious to anyone who is serious about getting their CCNP.I would recommend this book as a study aide."
4,"Action, suspense, and gruesome murder...","This book is the comic debut of writing team Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir, and all I can say is WOW! In just four issues, they craft a suspense filled, character driven story that could go up against any of the best episodes of the X-files.Federal Agent Greg Haworth partners up with reservation Officer Anne Adakai to track down a killer who takes and wears his victims' skins. With great art from Brian Hurtt (Queen & Country), the twists and turns in this mystery will keep you guessing to the very end!I can't recommend this book enough!"
1,Will drive you crazy,"We bought 10 strings of these little snowflake lights and went crazy trying to put them up. Before you buy these look at the snowflake shape and imagine how each snowflake will grab the one next to it or across from it. They are impossible and if it's cold out while you are wrestling with these little hummers, you will be angry too. We're giving them away this year."
2,bad for plants,"I have very hard water. When using this product, I got a fairly heavy precipitate, markedly decreasing the life of my filter. It also was really hard on my plants. The package insert says it can be dangerous to plants. If you have hard water, you probably need to use a water softener first for the product to be effective."
3,OK,I READ BITCH AND BITCH RELOADED THEY OK I JUST HATE THESE SHORT ASS BOOKS SO IM NOT SPENDING 10 BUCKS ON NO MORE OF THESR! WHY DONT YOU JUST MAKE IT 1 BOOK GEEZ
5,A MUST READ.....,THE VERY FIRST BOOK OF THE BIRCH SERIES WAS GREAT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER BOOKS ARE ABOUT YOU HAVE TO READ THE FIRST ONE....TO KNOW WHAT MS.CUMMINGS IS ALL ABOUT AND WHY THE HEAD BITCH.
5,Buy the sequel RIGHT NOW!!,"This is a GREAT read. The main character (Ms. Precious) makes you wish that you were her and not her all in the same book. If you are looking into buying this book, go ahead and get the sequel and part 2 to that as well. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed."
3,Page Turner,This was the first book that I read from this arthur. This was a Good Read that I was must say... I'm adjusting my fingers for the Sequel... Precious let them know who's really running Sh$$t...REVENGE!!!
5,HOT LIKE FIYA!!!!!!,"My sista gave me this book to read and from the first page I couldn't put it down. I don't even write reviews, but this book was so off the hook I had to say my two cents. Precious was straight ""Gangsta"" I've read a few street novels but the female characters usually all have the same formula but this character stood out. Her actions made you think and you never knew what type of crazy ass ish she was going to do next. The drama never stopped until the final page. I'm dying to read what this author puts out next because her writing skills is lethal."
3,Damn Precious!!,Don't play with Precious because it won't be pretty!! I loved the book but only towards the end the beginning was too slow! Over all this was a good read.
3,It's okay,This was a pretty simple book. Same formula used in so many other books. Reminded me a lot of some older Nikki Turner. I would recommend it for younger lovers of urban literature.
3,Waste of my money,"I know this was the authors first book, you can tell in the writing. There were hardly any details. Every time a character was introduced, you completely had to go with your imagination cuz the author wasnt tellin you nothin. I think this book in comparison to Dirty Red had a lot of simalar qaulities. This book was basically like an outline of that book, and Dirty Red was with details. I wouldn't recommend this book as far as going out to buy it because I feel as though I wasted my damn money. If anything, borrow the book, dont buy it.As far as buying the sequel, like i said before I understand that this was the authors first book, I probably wont. Checking it out at the nearest library; maybe. Authors grow over time. And this book was just an example of that."
4,WONDERFUL,IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE READ A BOOK NONSTOP. I JUST COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. THERE HAS TO BE A PART 2.
4,Good Read,"This book was a good read. Some of it was unrealistic but once you start reading you have to know what's going to happen next. I couldn't put the book down, I read it in two days."
4,A good tale from the hood,This is a good book to read for the summer. It is a ghetto soap opera. There are two books after this so I ordered the second one after I read this one.
5,EXCELLENT!,This was an EXCELLENT read! It kept me glued from page to page! I read this book in one day. A lot of drama and action rolled all into one. I would definitely recommend purchasing.
4,Good Book,"I Thought this book was good. The girl was all about herself until she fell in love, just like me. It's also crazy and grimy!!!"
2,Disappointing,"Echoing some of the other reviews - it's 'thin', disorganized and has a large Bill:Annie ratio. McMurtry's point is that, per the title, BB & AO were among the 1st superstars in America & he repeats it every other chapter or so. It reads like something that was whipped up over a weekend. The style & depth of the book are intentional on McMurtry's part but readers should be forewarned that this isn't a traditional biography."
3,A Curious Effort By A Great Author,"After just completing 1776 by David McCullough, and being mezmerized by his excellent story telling, I was anxious to read this non-fiction account of Bill Cody and Annie Oakley by Larry McMurtry. You see, early in the last century, my grandfather worked as an itinerant worker and gunsmith for the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show as well as the 101 Ranch. A lifetime of his stories made me anxious to read this book, especially as it was written by one of my favorite authors with a gift for all things western. I found the style disconnected, confusing and not up to Mr. McMurtry's normal quality. He's a great fiction writer, and I suppose everyone is entitled to an occasional disappointment."
2,I read the whole thing...,"...but only out of morbid curiosity to see if it got any better. It didn't. The chapters are too short to get into any real depth and the style struck me as scatterbrained. References were repeatedly made to people and events that were never really covered. Things that seemed to be important (death of Sitting Bull) were flown past, and McMurtry seemed to dwell on details that can't be known (reasons for divorce attempt in 1905). Lots of Bill and not so much Annie, like a few other reviewers said. It may be okay if you're looking for a eulogy on Buffalo Bill, but if you want an actual biography - especially on Annie Oakley - I'd look elsewhere."
5,Spicy and flavorful folk music from Hungary,"Muszikas' ""Ketto"" is a fine, fun, energetic collection of Hungarian folk music. (""Ketto,"" by the way, means ""two,"" in case your Hungarian-language proficiency, like mine, is limited.) The vocals, both solo and harmony, are strong and evocative. The instruments you will hear on the album include violin, viola, double bass, bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, Turkish pipe, zither, tambura, and koboz (a lute-like Hungarian instrument). Many nice changes of pace in the ten songs on the album. The helpful liner notes explain how the group Muszikas came to record in Holland in 1978, and how their work brought traditional Hungarian music to the world. Lyrics (in the original Hungarian) are provided for each song, along with an explanation of the traditions behind, and musical and lyrical emphasis of, each song. Recommended for listeners with an interest in Hungarian or Central/Eastern European music, or for aficionados of world music generally."
2,Does the trick,"warm, does what it supposed to do. A bit tighter than I thought, but not that bad.Revised a year later.. Product was good, but seller added me to a spam list 2 years later.... Traced it back to this purchase... will not buy from her again."
4,Head topper,"I bought this hat for my husband last Christmas. It is a nice, warm hat that I'd recommend to anyone."
2,Poorly Conceived,"I bought this book looking for an accessible overview of Chinese history. I was disappointed after reading it.While it held many interesting kernels, on the whole the book seems under-developed. I was hoping for insight into the themes driving China's history, but found little insight.The author has a recurring analogy about China--China is like a submarine sandwich. Really. I was willing to go along, but the whole thing falls apart and doesn't even hold up for his own purposes.Perhaps the author was trying to get too much into a macro-history book. I would not recommend this book."
3,Wilberforce is a good role model for perseverance!,"I read this non-fiction biography to my children.Before I read this book, I had never heard of William Wilberforce. He was born in England in 1759, and what he was best known for was his steadfast resolve in trying to abolish slavery. He presented 11 different Bills to Parliament over the course of 18 years in an effort to limit or abolish the slave trade. He finally met with success with his 12th Bill in 1807 with the enactment of the Slave Trade Act.This book provides a good overview of how the British parliamentary system works. Even though the content is pretty dry, we still found it interesting. Each chapter concludes with discussion questions, which enhanced our understanding of the content."
1,BOOK AS DESCRIBED BAD RATING IS FOR TERRIBLE learning potential of the book NOT the seller,"terrible book to learn from, awful examples and explanations are given to you by the authors so if you can get a better text book for examples"
4,my shadows&light experience,"i got this cd only two years ago, when i already had an almost-complete collection of joni's records. this musical exhibit is not something you can just hear while doing other things. you have to sit down, empty your ears, and let it fill you with it's exciting harmonies. the introduction is built exactly to those needs; it shoves you directly into the highly emotinal state in which you're gonna stay to the last seconds of woodstock. shadows and light is a live recording from santa barbara bowl (1979). it involves some of the best musicians in the world: jaco pastorius (bass), pat matheny (lead guitar), michael brecker (sax) and lyle mays (keyboards), don alias (drums). all those people really gave themselves to this project and you can't avoid feeling it. i do have a special sympathy to joni's cover for ""why do fools fall in love"" and also: ""in france they kiss on main street"" ""shadows and lighe"" ""coyote"" and the classic ""woodstock"". don't miss this cd- you'll love it."
3,Was Satisfied Until It Ripped,"Love this grill cover, but was disappointed that after 3 months of use it has ripped already near the top seam (allowing water to get in). Not sure what caused it, but assuming perhaps high winds put too much pressure on it? It is actually out in the open not near anything so pretty shocked that it ripped this quickly. Seemed A LOT sturdier than it is I guess.Fits the Char Broil 6 burner grill great, can put on while still hot (I never do though) and it looks nice. Just disappointed in the 5"" rip it now has at the top seam.I still recommend it, but don't expect it to last."
4,"Good cover, but high-heat ""ages"" it rapidly","I bought this for my new gas grill in April 2009, and am in the habit of putting the cover on the grill about 2 or 3 minutes after turning the heat off (while the grill is still at about 400 degrees or so). Over the last two years the cover has developed a number of cracks and a few small holes, which I believe are due to the high heat... it's a great heat-resistant cover, but it will likely last longer if you wait for the grill to cool a bit more than I do.Recommended, especially because of how well it's done under the rough treatment I've put it through."
4,Nice Grill Cover,This grill cover is made of high quality material and fits well over a large grill with both an outside burner and sink. It is heavy enough that it doesn't blow off and protects the grill through all seasons.
4,good,nice velcro closure tabs on both ends keeps cover in palce. They are wide and easy to use.cover is lightweight and easy to handlehasn't been through a winter yet so we'll see how holds up over time but so far everything is fine and it survived hurricane Sandy without issues.
2,Was expecting a better cover,"I bought this to replace the original cover on my Perfect Flame grill. After just two years, the cover is ripped in multiple places where the grill corners are located on the trays and top. Was hoping for a more durable cover, but this isn't it."
4,solid product,extremely happy with my purchase. love the lifetime warranty!! looking forward to many seasons of it protecting my grill!!! has a great heavy weight to it so it wont fly off.
5,Held up under the 90 mile/hr. winds of Sandy!!,"This very heavy-duty barbecue cover held up under the 90 plus mile and hour winds of Hurricane Sandy last Monday! I added some heavy rocks to either end for weight, but the cover, itself, protected the grill well enough that I was able to barbecue the days immediately after Hurricane Sandy. Without power for six days, that was a welcome plus.Mr. Bar-B-Q Platinum prestige cover deserves its 'Platinum Prestige' title. Just a note to the company: I wish you would make one even bigger than this one and I would not have had to remove one of my shelves from the barbecue unit BUT again....wonderful quality at a great price!"
5,Seems sturdy & strong,"Seems like a strong, sturdy cover but time will tell. Fits our grill which is slightly wider."
5,"A Year Later, Still Looks New","I had bought a premium grill cover a few days before seeing this in a Friday Sale. I bought this and gave the other one to my father. Bought it July '10 and it survived a hot summer, cold snowy winter, and rainy spring looking like I just took it out of the package. His was a shredded mess by March. Considering I had been thrilled to get 2 seasons out of similarly priced products and resigned to get one, I'm amazed that this is in perfect condition. I can see this cover lasting longer than the grill. Another plus is that the cover can be placed on the grill immediately after turning the burners off. While the steaks are resting, I clean my tools, shut off the gas and replace the cover - no need to make an extra trip outside into the cold and snow."
3,Tight Fit,"The material and construction is solid, but thet dimensions appear to be puffed an inch or two so it is a tight fit where it should be easy."
1,Don't buy if you live in Michigan,"Bought it in May, 2007. Saw couple of cracks few months a go and now there are quite a few in less than a year time - specially on top. It does say that it comes with lifetime warranty, but yet to find contact information for replacement.I think it did not take the Michigan winter. Since in less than a year it started cracking so much, I will not advice it to purchase."
1,Not heavy Duty!!!!!!,"I purchased this because the reviews said it was heavy duty. It got a small rip in it from putting it on. We have had bad weather lately-some wind, today the cover is completely ripped up, it's not even covering the top of the grill. I bought this two weeks ago."
3,"Could be bigger, too short for my grill.","This grill cover is just OK, the water get in to the grill and leaks on the control knobs, maybe because the grill is flat."
1,Poor Quality,I returned this item because the construction is poor. I have wasted money on covers with similar construction before & know it will not hold up against the season changes here on the East Coast. I was looking for a heavy duty cover that will withstand the elements and protect my expensive gas grill - this is not it. Very disappointed.
5,The book is great!!,I have read this book it is a very good book I recommend it for anyone from anyone from the age of 1-90 years old!!
4,This is a good book!,"The illustrations are really good in this book. I especially liked the keys on some pages that explain the many details in the pictures. I like the hidden faces in every picture. I like the Grumpets and Trumpets and their battles between bad and good. I like the maps. All aged kids would like this book and its companion, Grumpets in Trumpetland."
5,Excellent resource for the music student.,"I was impressed with the content and selections. As a student beginning to study the Swing genre of Jazz, I found the format easy to use and to follow. Many of the songs have the introductions and turn-arounds spelled out, which really add to the pleasure of learning these classics."
4,"A good, if somewhat limited, swing book","I lead a dance band and was looking for a good, complete swing book for some charts. While this book doesn't have all the tunes I was looking for, it has an impressive selection of numbers that were recorded between 1936 and 1947. It has standards like In The Mood, All The Things You Are, Caravan, God Bless The Child, Heart and Soul, My Funny Valentine, Sentimental Journey, String Of Pearls, Take The 'A' Train, and Tuxedo Junction. It's not a complete book for a dance job but it's a vaulable reference for a working musician."
3,OK,These were just mehhh. They did the job but I thought they were pricey considering the small quantity I received.
2,Needy.,"While 'Official Riven the Sequel to Myst Hints and Solutions' does provide good help, I found that when a certain crucial combination that I had tried and tried was not working and I looked to the book for help, I found that the true solution is not in there. Now I am left to wait until someone I know figures it out. Needy and lacking."
1,"Will not fit 9"" square gas burners","It seemed nice enough, but the diagonal corners won't allow it to sit square on 9"" gas burners. Removing the burner grids won't help - it then sits too close to the burners, and they won't burn properly."
1,Mr. Bar-B-Q Dual Grilling Skillet,"I initially liked the light weight and thought of a non-stick surface, but after the first use (we cooked some hot dogs on it) there was a haze on the surface of the skillet that would not come off during washing. The second time I used it, I cooked some hahburgers on it. After cleaning it, the non-stick surface coating began to seperate from the skillet, making it unusable after only two uses. Not very good considering the price of the skillet."
4,Nice,"These are interesting. If you can get used to the feeling, you might enjoy them. They provide the necessary support to do almost anything, and they are virtually invisible under your pants or shorts. Good for the price, and considering calvin klein is pretty expensive, it's a pretty good deal."
3,Engrossing first-time novel.,"This is an interesting story, with a fascinating concept. On the other hand, it does play into the western stereotype of Muslims as terrorists, and there are some assumptions about Islam that are a hard to believe. For example, it is not likely that Muslims would flock so easily en masse to a person who is said to be a new prophet of God when the belief in Muhammad as the Seal of the Prophets is a requirement of Muslim faith. While the book is hard to put down, the ending does not fully realize the promise of the premise of the book and the development of the character of Bennet Williams is uneven."
2,not as universal as you'd think,"with the toro riding mower i have, had to make adapter to mount the seat, but alot cheap then toro"
5,Excellent music,"It isn't often that I enjoy every track on an album, but I do so with this one! Very good mix of Bkues!"
3,why yet again?,"Angel Corpse have done it again. Another slab of darkened death. But AGAIN with the awful production!! They sounded best when I saw them live back in 1999. So much skill in metal except in the recording department. WTF Angel Corpse? Hire a recording pro next time. Please! It almost brings me to tears to imagine their albums with the sound quality of say, Divine Heresy. Almost as tragic as Cradle of Filth's great album 'Cruelty and the Beast' that also suffered from poor sound production. And for all you fools out there who like bad production because it supposedly sounds 'real' or some such nonsense really need to get a clue. I suppose you also reject HDTV and instead prefer fuzzy broadcast. Backwards thinking. Grow up."
2,Don't waste your money!,"Not worth it. The bio's unauthorized, which I didn't realize. Maybe not such a big deal to other fans, but the interview clips are taken out of context and the sound quality of the interviews is terrible. What's worse is that they got the year of his birth wrong. Should've stopped listening at that point."
4,it's not great,"Eminem hardly talks or raps on this bio. i was expecting to hear more of Eminem than i did. it was slightly disappointing. i learned something about eminem and some bullies and how he almost died, though. that was one interesting part of the bio."
3,Straight from Detroit,"This explosive CD allows Shady fans a insight into the politically incorrect mind of one of the most meanest MCs in the world. Reflecting on experiences that shaped him to be what he is today Eminem expands the minds of those who dare to buy this controversial biography. His tale proves that its not easy in the hip hop world, especially for a ""white boy""."
4,A Great Intro,"This is a great introduction to the Episcopal Church for anyone who considers themself to be an intellectual, a skeptic, or a secular humanist. Adams is witty and backs up his arguments with a theology that invites people in to experience Christ without fearing that they'll be brainwashed."
3,"Excellent for review, poor for introduction","Seow's introductions to noun morphology, the article, prepositions and pronouns are good. However, I found Seow's verb introductions too steep for me, a student who had no previous exposure to Hebrew or any other Semitic language.Seow does not drill the student enough toward confidence in reading whole sentences and extended passages.Seow provides excellent excurses about the BDB lexicon, reading markers and pausal forms, nomenclature for verbal patterns and root types, reference grammars, poetic Hebrew, and orientation to the Hebrew Bible.I do recommend Seow's book as a review text. Because of the steep verb introductions, I do not recommend it as the main text for students who have no previous familiarity with Hebrew or any other Semitic language."
4,good beginner handbook,"Seow's progression through the basics of Hebrew grammar is recognized in many seminaries and universities. Sometimes his definitions and explanations of certain Hebrew phenomena are oversimplified, but all in all this is a great tool for the beginner. It's compact, hardbound, and easy to follow. The basic edition lacks an answer key, so one should be hesitant to utilize this book outside a classroom setting or for independent study. The only problems with the book are it's lack of exhaustive index at the rear, it's inability to teach the student to think from English to Hebrew, and some of its Hebrew spellings are incorrect (as pointed out by a former instructor). All in all, I recommend it."
1,warning: no Hebrew-English glossary in revised edition,"While no one grammar is perfect, this one is fatally flawed by not having a Hebrew to English glossary. Had I known this, I would have purchased the first edition instead, which does have one. I also don't like having to use a separate Hebrew text (plus a dictionary) to do the exercises, which means you cannot use this grammar on the go. The explanations are not clear, and Seow gives you too many vocabulary words and not enough easy excercises to reenforce them.The pros are that you do read a lot of the Hebrew Bible and you are more prepared to move on to real reading, but even so, I think a much better choice is Weingreen's ""A Practical Grammar for Classical Hebrew."" At the very least, though, get Seow's first edition because trying to use a grammar without a Hebrew to English glossary is a nightmare. I don't know what Seow was thinking in leaving one out. I really regret buying this book."
2,Nice . . . but not great,"This book is good for those who teach an older method of Hebrew, but much of its terminology is the authors (for example verb forms) and is not consistent with the mainstream. It is a difficult follow up to other Hebrew grammars, and many Hebrew courses."
3,OK - for work,These looked as image implies. So far only an OKAY from me. The toes fit too close but after some wear I hope they'd adjust nicely. a little on the weighty side but good sole comfort! Only worth the sale price given the detailed issues.
2,Basement Level Quality,Material is man-made and cheap. These are the type of shoes you can buy at Payless or Walmart. Save your money and get something a little nicer.
5,"holy macaroni, thistle take the boogie out of your tissue","i admit it, i've been binge-ing for the past six months....on 60s jamaican ska and rock steady. i can't git enough of its simple rhythms, tastey horn lines, and overall smooth feel. this album, as the title suggests, is all about the early sounds of jamaican two, three, and four part vocal harmony. i've yet to come across another compilation which includes any of these tracks. if you're like me and are digging deeply for new music from this window in music history, pick up this record for your collection; you too will dig it deeply!"
2,I really wanted to like this book...,This book has a wonderfully timely theme. The subplots on human genome research and bio-terrorism couldn't be more now. The author has a great vocabulary and an interesting use of language. I really wanted to like this book but found the poor editing jarring and the romantic angle off putting. The characters are two dimensional. The book reminded me of the Jerry Lamb/Bertha Cool mysteries of the 1950's.
2,Starts bad..then gets ok...then gets just plain stupid!,"I, like the previous reviewer, wanted to like the book. I like good whodunits, but this is no whodounit. This is a MD turned writer/author and put all of his daydreams of being a detective on paper. I almost put the book down after reading the first 10 pages, but stuck with it. It starts bad, then turns into somewhat of a decent mystery, but then turns really bad. No longer a mystery but a just a long string of dumb conversations and incidents with one stereotype after another (mafia, south american president, etc). No wonder I found it in the $5 bin at Barnes and Noble. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does have a decent middle."
4,Nice,This is really good stuff. I recently decided to start using almond flour in place of regular flour and this tastes great. It's a little heavier but has a buttery taste that I prefer to regular flour. I recommend.
2,"OK, but won't be buying again","I didn't realize how good Trader Joe's almond flour was until I tried this brand! The problem with this brand is that the grind is so uneven and chunky and also makes my baked goods really dense. Not only is Trader Joe's a fraction of the price of this brand, the grind is very fine and consistent. Cost of TJ's is $4.00 for 16oz. Also, I like the richness and extra fiber of the skins left on."
1,Not 100% safe for SCD/GAPS!,"BRM 'gluten free' items still contain some sort of gluten cross contamination. We started SCD/GAPS to deal with lingering health problems caused by eating a regular GF diet for our Celiacs. I bought 2 different brands of almond flour, one made specifically for and by SCD and BRM. We used up the other brand and started using the BRM and guess what? ALL symptoms of Celiac started coming back!! Doing an Internet search I did find out that many Celiac's not only react badly to BRM almond flour, but to many other of BRM GF items too. Before SCD, we had stopped using any BRM GF baking products because we always got 'gluten sick ' from them. We will NEVER use another GF flour from BRM again because their food safety is just not strict enough. I did get a prompt refund from BRM for the $125 I spent on the 25lb box of almond flour though."
3,Where are these almonds from?,I noticed no enhancement of flavor from substituting almond flour for some of the regular flour. So many recipes call for grinding almonds that I am grateful to have this on hand but I looked apprehensively through the flour at the brown bits to see if they were bugs. This product is expensive and requires storage in the refrigerator.
4,Great Way to Slim Down,"My wife is the cook/baker at home, and she uses this stuff in all sorts of recipes. It's a great alternative to white flower."
4,Good almond flour,I've cooked with almond flour before but at the store it's $10 for one packet of flour which I go through quickly. This was a great deal and it came in the Bob's Red Mill box that would be a display at the store which I found neat. Definitely recommend to purchase if you are a gluten-free baker or just need some decently priced almond flour.
5,"Super Reference Book, with one small flaw!","I can't say enough good things about the information presented in this book - it has become a primary reference for me in all of my technical writing. I also use the Mcrosoft Sytle guide in conjunction with this book and find that the two balance each other very well. The one flaw with this book is -- as noted by another reviewer -- the CD. Frame Viewer is a product from the original authors of FrameMaker and, quite frankly, it's old! Also -- and this is most significant -- the files are .doc files, created with an older version of Frame. I found the best solution was to copy the .doc files into a separate folder, then open them directly with FM 5.5.6. The automatic conversion is performed and you can then save them as .fm files and even generate a pdf for personal ease-of-use."
3,"Good Book, but watch out for the CD!","Reasonably good book, especially for style information, but found areas in the book where they did not follow their own advice.The FrameViewer CD that accompanied the book caused considerable problems once loaded on my PC. Only after 3 long distance phone calls, taking better than 2 hours out of my day waiting on hold, being transferred, etc. did I find out who, exactly, was responsible for the software!From what I saw (and what the techs at Adobe could determine) there is no way to uninstall this software! Buyer beware!I had to work with Adobe Tech Support to at least get my other programs working reliably again! A very hard lesson learned, indeed! If you intend to use the FrameViewer software, take heed of these problems!"
4,Excellent source for developing a concise style guide.,"There's a lot of great information in this book. When you're starting from nothing to develop a style guide, it's a great resource. So much of what we do when creating technical documentation is done as a matter of practice. Getting the structure down and having this book to jog our memory was fantastic.One improvement would be to include a section on layout and design.I liked the formulas for calculating hours found under Recommended Reading. Good information about developing a publications department, too. Nice overview for constructing a document plan.This is definately a book for people who do not have an established publication/documentation department. There's lots of great information found in the 256 pages."
2,A Glaring Weakness,How annoying to turn to the Recommended Reading section and find that many of the books are out of print.
4,Good Quality Product,"Not much to say. It is just tin snips. But, they feel heavy-duty and did a great job when I installed my drop ceiling."
3,Malco Aviation snip,The quality of these snips is low. They work for what I need but if you are looking for a quality product don't purchase these snips.
3,Disney Cars: McQueen Tricycle - review,I have found the product to be adequate for the price. My two year old likes to ride it so it is getting used. I've noticed that the tires are wearing very quickly and would need to be the first parts to be replaced should I decide to keep the product for a significant amount of time. I believe my child will out grow it before that is necessary though.
3,tough to assemble,"This trike is fine once you put it together but it's really tough to assemble. The directions are not exact, there were extra parts and the parts don't fit well. Once you get thru that it's fine. My 3 year old son loves it!"
2,okay,The bike came in a timely fashion however it seemed to be damaged during delivery. I returned the item for a refund.
5,FATHER KNOWS BEST,Love the dvd. I always like to watch it on tv when I was young. Now I can again. Great dvd nice and clear.
5,"Great TV series, Classic Nuclear Family as it should be","Bought this for a gift for my Dad. He loves this series, he watches it over and over again. Great stories and adventures of a Nuclear Family as it should be :). Highly recommend for as a fathers day gift."
4,The bridge between Freud and XXI Century's Neuroanalysis,"If you think Freud is dead, or even if he had, once in his life, forgot his 1895's Project, just forget it. Read this book and you'll see that a new stage of art and science is going to take place. Although most of neuro and psy aproaches insist to forget Freud's Project as something old and unuseful, here you'll have reasons why not to do it. An excelent aproach that all those who call themselves freudian or even psychoanalitic professionals must read, in order to reflect about clinic, metapsychology, theory and technic psycho affairs."
4,I couldn't put it down!!,"Mr. Burrall captured my attention in the first paragraph. As the true story unfolded, I couldn't wait to see what happens to the crew of the Frieda-K ! A must read for teen boys and older who enjoy maritime details and adventure. I read it to my four children age 5 - 12, and they all enjoyed it."
5,Helps stop itching,My dog has very sensitive skin. This product helps her skin not to itch as much. It leaves her coat shiny too. I use it once a month and use it per the directions.
4,This tea really works.,"I like to use this tea it helps clean me out and it is gentle on my stomach. It doesn't make you cramp. And I love hot tea, and the taste is mild, so it is great!"
2,Copy Protection,"I'm a huge fan of Faithless, and these remixes are ok, but I want to stress that the version I bought anyway, you can't copy it to your computer. Since I listen to cds almost exclusively on computer or mp3, it makes it pretty much worthless. Shame on you Faithless."
5,this stuff works,"I have warded off several seemingly impending colds with Airborne. There's a very small window of opportunity but when I've managed to use it the minute I've had that tell-tale scratchiness in my throat and up into my ears, it has worked for me. I bought from amazon because for some reason, the pink grapefruit flavor has become hard to find and it's by far my favorite. Actually very pleasant and not medicinal tasting. I give it five stars all day long!"
2,not this stuff,I have been using FRS & wanted to try a E- Boost but it made me feel horrible ! I recommend FRS !
3,It works but the flavor? UGH!,"It works and has helped me many times. But the Very Berry flavor tastes terrible! Better to get a citrus flavor. I think Pink Grapefruit is pretty unoffensive and mild. So, yes to Airborne. No to Very Berry."
1,Misleading Product Description,Product description says 60 counts. However after receiving the product I found they sent me a tube of only 10 tablets.. that makes it only 10 counts. I'll try to find out how to get in contact with the seller to verify what I'm supposed to receive.
1,The container came in broken and i was not refunded my money,The seller provided me with damaged product and refused to refund or send me a new thing of airborn. Dont waste your time...and go to CVS!
4,Hood exhaust fan,I was looking for a Hood exhaust fan to replace my original unit that failed and I wanted a after market universal replacement unit that cost less. I am happy with the replacement unit that I ordered and would recommend the retailer and their price.
5,Incredible and inspiring,"I asked my wife what book she'd recommend if I only read one homeschooling book this year. This is the book. It's incredible! I'm so much more excited about learning with my kids now!Albert's perspective is extremely life affirming. I HIGHLY recommend this book, even if you're not thinking of homeschooling."
2,Disappointed,"As a new homeschooler, I was looking forward to this much vaunted book. I was disappointed to find that it had little to offer me in terms of either inspiration or practical advice. As a beautiful tribute from a father to an extraordinary daughter, perhaps it has merit. But the ""definitive work on homeschooling"" (as claimed on the back) it is not."
2,Some good ideas if you can get past the style,"There are some decent ideas here, but I agree with the reviewer below who mentioned the self-congratulatory style. It was really distracting, so much so that I gave up reading it through and just skimmed the resources at the end of the chapters."
4,Soft and cuddly puppy dog,"This is a good soft toy to cuddle up with. We didn't like the scratchy gold bow but easy to remove.I bought this for my 4 year old. He doesn't understand the ""naming the star"" stuff. Hoping it is still around in another couple years."
2,Does nothing!,"I bought this toy yesterday for my daughter. She came home to log in her new friend only to discover that she was not able to do anything but name a star. For all the other areas on the website we only received a message saying ""Coming Soon"". She was not able to name her friend or play any of the games. Quite a disappointment."
3,Good for absolute beginners,"I think this DVD is fine for absolute beginners but for anyone who has done pilates with a personal trainer or taken mat classes with a good teacher for a long time, this DVD is simply too easy."
1,Very disappointed,"I'm a pilates novice but even i noticed that this video lacked instruction to good form (like when to ""imprint"") or proper breathing which are KEY to a good workout. For those who've done pilates before: The ""hundred"" was shown with both feet placed on the floor - it wasn't even worth it. When the video ended I was still waiting for the workout to begin. I was very surprised that I was this disappointed, but I'll never use this video again."
2,Lack of detail and annoying aerobics voice,"I wanted a video to supplement what I've learned through private lessons. This one was awful! The instructor doesn't give sufficient detail as to what you actually need to do - she seems more caught up in perfecting her performance of chanting the commands in a singsong voice. I could have tolerated the voice had she been actually telling you what to do. I would not recommend this for beginners, nor anyone else."
2,Not impressed,"I found this dvd to be very slow. There is only one workout on the tape and it is only 20 minutes long. Most of this time is spent talking, not streching."
3,Matched What I Was Looking For,"The workout is easy enough to follow. It covers an overall body workout for around 30 minutes - abs, back, thighs.I did, however, find myself relying on my previous experience with pilates elsewhere in order to get the most out of the workout. The instructor, Moira, does a good attempt reminding when to breathe and which body parts to take note of, but it is really nothing like having an instructor on-hand to correct your posture, etc.Bottom-line, I would buy it for someone else - but only if the person had tried pilates before. Still, this DVD matched what I was looking for - which was a supplement pilates regime I could do in the comfort of my home. The wonderful thing about being a DVD is that i could pause to re-do certain exercises, or simply double-up and do 2 sessions of the workout for a longer workout.I read some other review about the sing-song voice but it didn't bother me at all. Besides, there is an option to do the workout to music only."
5,Exellent pilates DVD,I have purchased several pilates workouts including one done by Denise Austin but I have to say that this is the best DVD. It is authentic Pilates and since this is a beginner DVD it offers the beginning moves. The instructor does an excellent job of really providing direction and information so I can do the moves easily. The DVD is so thorough and well done that I didn't feel the need to take a Pilates class first just so I would know and be familiar with the moves. It is really a good home video and a great start to Pilates.
3,Basic Pilates,"This is a great product for those who want to learn the basics. However, if you want to save money; puchase the walking pilates for weight loss. You get 2 workouts for the price of one. The walking phase is easy and fun to do-- and it is a real workout. You are sweating at the end of the 30 or 45 min session. The second workout is Stott Pilates. Moira does a great job of taking you through the poses. While the basic pilates dvd is good, you can get just as good of a workout using another beginning Stott Pilates workout."
1,Disappointed,"This is a very basic introduction and not really a workout. It is also very short, maybe15min. max. Explanations not helpful. Don't waste your money."
2,Wrong for me,Watchman Nee's topic and points made are interesting and educational but his views are not shared by me. Would not recommend.
5,Cream of the Crop,"If you're just gettting into Watchman Nee I'd suggest ordering this and not going much further. Much of his other work I'd rather use as a doorstop but this is Nee at his Christ-centered best. The most outstanding thing about that book is that almost no practical application is given. He gives the reader the Lord Jesus Christ risen and alive and trusts that the life presented will do what it needs to do. Its an amazing little gem. Forget what I first said, go ahead and order 5 or 10 copies because you'll soon be giving them to your family and friends. They'll soon be asking about the smile on your face."
5,One of the best Christian books I've ever read,"This is an awesome book, because it is all about how Christ is everything we need. His grace is completely sufficient, and our works are irrelevant. We don't need to ask for holiness or goodness or anything, because through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, Christ is everything for us. The focus is on His greatness, not on trying to refurbish us. This book is the antidote to all those shallow, burdensome Christian self-help books!"
5,Christ is the sum and reality of all spiritual things:,"Watchman Nee's Normal Christian Life talked mainly about the fact of redemption and justification based on the book of Romans (especially Chapter 6, 7, and 8), and a little bit about Christ person. While in this book he went much further to reveal God's complete salvation through Christ - a living person put into Christ's believers to be their redemption, righteousness, life, love, patience, peace, joy, humble, and everything! Only Christ exists in God's eye in the whole university. It is really blessed to see this revelation concerning Christ person as a reality of all, because the whole Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ (Revelation 1:1). This book can help Christ's believers open a spiritual eye to see this wonderful all-inclusive Christ who is far beyond human imagination."
4,Good for the price,Bought two of these off of Amazon a lot cheaper than in the local Best Buy. They are easy to install and work farely well. The only issue I have is I have not figured out how to get around dialing using the phone keypad.
4,It works...,"I installed it with Kenwood DNX7100 DVD navigation receiver. It works, but so far I couldn't find how to make it do more than just a headset (pickup/drop calls). I'm not sure if it is my phones' problem though... Sound quality is good, but I had to balance incoming voice to far right so the microphone will not pick it up and create echo."
3,Not a bad accessory,This unit work very well with the kenwood KVT-819dvd head unit. The only concern I had with the unit is that the mic cable is too short........ I had to extend the cable.
1,Did not receive,"Bottom line, DO NOT BUY from DISCOUNT JUNGLE I bought several electronics from Amazon at the same time. Received all other merchandise in good working order as promised and sooner than expected.Did not receive product. Customer service at Discount Jungle is aweful. Most calls are answered by the fax machine. If you do get a rep. they provide limited info. never return calls or send emails to update your status I ordered a product 2 months ago and never received one phone call or email from Discount Jungle. After calling them for two months they finally tell me they are going to nothing. But a manager was supposed to call."
1,Disappointed,I found these CDs on Amazon. Amazon was the only place I could find this particular CD and I bought the only two you had for sale. It was a collection of my favorite songs by my favorite singer and I bought both CDs to give to special people in my life. I was very disappointed to find that both CDs were scratched and did not play well. This is the first time I have been disapointed with an order from Amazon. I would love to hear from someone who can tell me what I can do to have the CD's replaced.
1,Absolutely worthless,"This article is of absolutely no value. The mathematical expressions are not included, but instead statements are substituted that say:[MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]Absolutely worthless."
5,Perfect,"I purchased this product for a new wine cellar I was having out in my basement. It was just what I wanted. The room is a Tuscan design, and the rustic, casual look of this fixture fits with the decor nicely. I have put it on a dimmer and am using fairly low wattage bulbs so the number of lights is not overpowering.Well made, easy to install. I would highly recommend the product."
3,What You Really Need To Know About This Album,"First it's a soundtrack, much like Toto's Dune, this is not Journey Music you'll have heard. #2, most all of these songs are insturmentals, with the one featuring Steve Perry singing, ""Little Girl,"" sound a lot like B-sides: also available on the Times 3 Box set. If you're a big journey fan of their first three albums before Steve Perry, you might {and I stress might} like the album. If you like Escape & Fronteirs most it's much less likely. As much as I like every version of Journey, I haven't it all the way through this album a second time, despite numerous tries."
4,As a former college radio enthusiast...,"I must say that any time that the concept of Journey coming up as a musical group I generally balked at the idea of ""Don't Stop Believin'"" was EVER going to make a transition into our group, but I stumbled upon this record completely by chance via the song, ""Sandcastles"", and found an album oriented beast of variance from a time machine. In an instant I was displaced successfully into what felt like the 70's and all was well.Yea man..."
1,very disappointed,The wand broke within 2.5 minutes of my son using it! Would only recommend for kids under 10.
2,Glass is Half Empty,"This review is from a spouse of a breast cancer survivor:I must say that my wife has read several books on this topic during her recovery and reconstruction. This book by far is the most negative. It chronicles the stories of several women whom all seem to be late 20's / early 30's without a spouse or children. They had no support network and obviously were looking at the situation from a ""glass is half empty"" perspective. I would not recommend this book as an inspiring read for any woman or family member dealing with this disease looking for positive energy. There is none . Furthermore, it is written by someone who has never personally experienced it. Pick-up ""Mama Told Me There Would Be Days Like These"" or ""Why I Wore Lipstick To My Masectomy"" as alternatives. Both were written by breast cancer survivors and have a much more positive tone. Something we husbands desperately need as we are supporting our spouses."
4,Pros and Cons,"Pros: The ink is great for printing out my college papers and for pictures.Cons: It runs out quicky.But if you don't print a lot, if it's just a few college papers, it'll last you."
3,Not compatible with the Moto Q 9H,This is a nice sturdy case but it does not fit the Moto Q 9H and it does not state that anywhere in the description.
1,Don't Bother,"The idea is great but the skin is too thick, the openings are not big enough and it effects the phone performance."
3,Good product with a few flaws,"Have had the Tough Skin for almost 5 months now, and it definitely keeps the phone protected and in good shape. Unfortunately, the rubber is also prone t stretching, so the initially snug fit now hangs loose in places, reducing its effectiveness and making it easy to snag, especially coming in and out of a pocket. Also, screen can smudge, as others have said, but easy to clean, although removing and replacing only stretches the case further. Aside from the stretching issue, highly recommended, but it may have a short shelf life."
5,"Great case, fair clip.","I purchased this product for the case. I travel quite a bit and my Q gets bumped around in my pocket and in transisiton from my pack to whereever I'm going. The Q fits snugly in the protective case and protects all vital pieces while allowing access to the most important parts of the phone- namely the keyboard and charging port. I currently use the standard battery but I'm fairly confident that the extended battery will also fit in this case.This case even comes with a protective lens cover. Here's a tip- wipe down your screen before inserting the protectice cover or you'll have to view your messages through messy smudges.Lastly, the clip. Do not buy this set if you are buying it for the clip. It is a basic, inexpensive clip that does its job but is nothing special. The phone fits snugly in the clip and does not fall out. The challenge is getting it off the clip in time to answer incoming calls."
5,Therapy for Musicians,"""Ohmigod,"" we said in stereo. You see, our band's van broke down on the same stretch of road that's in the movie...we laughed till we almost wet ourselves. This movie will remind you why you are in a band...and make you feel better about it.Bandwagon is also a fabulous film, in all regards.If you like the music, check out the Connells."
5,Abuse of the Courts in America,"Including ""The Declaration of Independence"" and ""The Constitution of the United States of America"" in this informative book was an excellent idea. Everyone in America should read these documents, our children in particular. Through corruption, greed and far-reaching agendas, these blueprint documents for a Republic are at this point, beyond recognition. This is not a sudden event, it has happened because citizens of America have been derelict in their duties as citizens to protect our nation and call to judgment those that have been elected that have put forward questionable policies and practiced corruption. We have not questioned enough what the end would be and I fear, we are well on our way to finding out. Having lived in other countries, I learned at a young age that America is a great land. We have lost a great deal of freedom over the years and at present, it is at avalanche speed. An avalanche is deadly and it ""changes"" all that is in its path."
1,The Problem with Cherry-Picking,The problem with cherry-picking history is that we never get to the truth. It becomes very obvious after reading this book that Barton has an agenda and will stop at nothing to support his hypothesis. This is not the work of an objective historian; it is the result of cherry-picking through archives of history trying to find any quote in or out of context that supports this hypothesis and ignoring the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The book is absolute rubbish and the fact that uneducated people are influenced by reading this book is horrifying.
1,Attributes nonexistent quotes to early presidents,"David Barton's THE MYTH OF SEPARATION tries to make a case for dismantling the wall of separation between church and state, but it does so partially by putting words in the mouths of early American statesmen such as Jefferson and Washington. At least ten quotes from the Founding Fathers in this book were independently researched and found to be either questionable or just plain false, rendering MYTH unreliable. Barton has since released ORIGINAL INTENT, which replaces MYTH and removes the spurious quotes, but still has a few errors."
1,A totally awful book.,It is written to support a false thesis by misinformation. It ignores the impact of the Fourteenth Amendment and misrepresents what the original constitutional framers did.
5,Meaningful Notes From Reading And From Listening,"""Gregg Notehand, A Personal-Use Shorthand with Integrated Instruction in How to Make Notes, was written to meet a student need that educators have long recognized - instruction in making intelligent, MEANINGFUL NOTES FROM READING AND FROM LISTENING.....""[from the book of the preface]"
5,PINK FLOYD - UN PASADO MUY PRESENTE,"ES UN EXCELENTE GRUPO, YA QUE SUPO EXPLOTAR LA TECNOLOGIA Y CONVERTIRLA EN SONIDOS Y EFECTOS PSYCODELICOS HACIENDO UN PRODUCTO TOTALMENTE VANGUARDISTA A CADA EPOCA EN QUE SE FUE MOSTRANDO, A LA ACTUALIDAD PUEDES ESCUCHAR DE LOS PRIMEROS DISCOS DE PINK FLOYD Y UBICARLO EN NUESTRO TIEMPO, POCOS GRUPOS LOGRARON ESTO, PERO EN GENERAL LA FORMA DE EXPRESARSE MUSICALMENTE ES UNICO, NO TIENEN LIMITES, MIENTRAS MAS PROFUNDOS SEAN MAS CONTENIDO SE ENCUENTRA EN SUS PRODUCCIONES. ES UN GRUPO DONDE LA LUZ, EL SONIDO Y LA INTERPRETACION LES EXIJEN PARA SEGUIR EVOLUCIONANDO."
5,"You're right, Massoud","The fellow who wrote the other review on this page, Massoud Javadi ""Jackson"", is absolutely correct. This novel is a rare find but well worth your search efforts.The prose is fluid and spare, yet conversational in a cosy, storyteller way. The problems of decolonialisation are illustrated comically, lucidly, thoughtfully. You might find yourself laughing at the natives before realising that Mimouni has made you sympathise with them. Their plight is real, their voices need to be heard. Mimouni, who died during the 1990s (if any person, living or dead, ever reads this review, please reply me as to when exactly he died and of what), brings these fresh voices to life.carry on, farsad"
1,A pure Zionist propaganda,I love history but this DVD is not history. It starts out with montage of newsreel clips only shown to influence the viewers. Heavily pretentious and biased.
1,negative stars??,"This is my third version of Britannica. It is a definite improvement in content but a disaster in performance. Not only does it require returning to an obsolete version of Java runtime, it conflicts with my antivirus. Save yourself the time and trouble of returning it."
3,Pathetically slow,"I love my print version of Britiannica but the DVD Ultimate reference was a big disappointment. The user interface is terrible, with the article itself occupying only a small window surrounded by variouss navigation controls. It is hard to quickly scan or read a large article without frequent clicking and scrolling.The main problem is its slowness- Why is it that google can search the internet in 0.1 seconds while Britannica on a Mac 1.33GHz G4 takes ages (actually about 20s) to load and 5-10s to search for and view an article ?I hope that the PC implementation works better, but I fear that the great work of many authors has been let down by very poor software implentation."
2,Adequate (barely),"I have Pentium 4 2.4 Ghz PC with 256k memory and Win XP. Though I've loaded the Suite onto my hard drive, it's very slow to start up and slow to bring up articles and media. The Atlas really only serves as a SLOW visual index to articles in the encyclopedia since it only has country level maps and some links don't work. The media ranges from quite nice to outdated stuff they must have dug out of the broom closet. On the other hand, being Britannica, the content of the encyclopedia is good and the separate interfaces for adults, teens, and children has potential - if only they could speed it up! The rebates make this a product I'll keep, but rarely use - I could drive to the library and still get my answers from the Encyclopedia Britannica - maybe quicker."
3,Let's wait for a Better EB software,"This is the conclusion after reading all the reviews of previous products of Encarta and Encyclopaedia Britannica and of my own experience. Content wise, the EB is superior than Encarta. Yet EB software needs to be improved.The BEST way to get Britannica to produce a better software:(1) Boycott their products untill better ones are produced.(2) Make public statements regading their bad products.(3) Direct complaints to Britannica by phone and e-mail.IF Encarta, EB and other Encyclopaedias (at least the software editions) merge it would be great. That would create the sole SUPERENCYCLOPAEDIA. Another Internet/Super-Information- Highway! Please make this matter public."
1,defective,"I am not able to see its contents since it has not been possible for me to run this dvd.Otherwise, britannica is good souce of information."
3,"Songs are good, sound quality is poor.","When I first saw this CD on the shelf, I snapped it up in an instant. I was a budding new Jazz enthusiast wanting to pick up a few good compilation albums, and when I saw the listing of sings and artists on here, I thought it would be perfect. When I got it home, I popped it in the CD player first thing. To make a long story short, the sound quality is very poor. There is a ton of hiss and you have to crank up the volume to hear the music (thereby amplifying the hiss and distorting the sound even more). I understand that leaving the hiss in makes it more authentic to what records were like, but then again, I'm spoiled by CDs and crystal clear music. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore the songs, they are priceless and well worth the little bit of money I paid. I was just dissapointed that the quality was so poor."
5,Strong quiet type,"A wonderful addition to my kitchen ware. I love the fat free option and consistently good results.Thank you ""endurance"" for a fine product.Charlene Mikkelsen"
4,"If you want to regularly poach eggs, this is for you.","Heavy. my last egg poacher was a cheap bargain product and no end to the problems (it was also 20 years old).I was first hit buy the weight, heavy sturdy product.the cups are individual, each non stick coated, a little margarine or non stick spray and you are good to go. i found picking the cups up a problem (with forks etc) till i finally just started using some pliers I keep in the kitchen. eggs just fall out and they are almost perfect every time (not perfect because of the cook not the cookware)couldnt be more pleased with the product.oh the handle is metal, i was somewhat worried there but have found that if I ever left the pan on long enough to let the handle burn me the eggs would be ruined."
2,Too many parts,"The poacher has a few flaws1. Not easy to pick up the pods when hot even when you have a hot glove? They are so close together you have to have some pretty tiny hands to get the pods out when hot.2. Other poachers have one less piece which makes it easier to clean. This poacher has a stainless steel ring around the pod which does not always stay in placeGood points1. Eggs cook evenly.2. Not too much sticking when the egg is cooked.This product does it's job, but not impressed with the quality given the price."
1,Non Receipt,"I never received this product. Company calimed it was shipped, but only tracking Info showed that electronic data was received & nothing else. Vendor claimed the USPS lost the item. Vendor also claimed there was no more in stock & refunded purchase price."
1,"Poor Construction, Poor Quality, Poor Results","Selected for reputation of Stainless Steel and RSVP Products as superior. Not the case on this Poacher Set.I have used it no more than four times. Stainless Steel stained, non-stick coating scratched, and the Stainless Steel Pan cracked at the lip.Would not recommend it and will not buy again."
4,Edinburgh's Answer To The Pretty Things,"OK, maybe that's a little bit of hype. Noone can match the power of the Pretty Things, however Edinburgh, Scotland's Thanes give it a heck of a go!!!!! I first caught them in the late 80's (I think they were the Thanes of Cawdor back then - Shakespeare would be proud) and I've never stopped spinning their vinyl. This is a great compilation of a great band. If you're a fan of 60's garage / British beat R & B ala the Stones, Downliners Sect or Pretty Things - get this! Lenny Helsing of the Thanes is now part of the Wildebeests - another wild combo!! Check 'em out too!"
5,Favorite Battlefield Band CD,"I have several Battlefield Band CDs and this is by far my favorite. It has numerous upbeat tunes and such memorable songs as ""The Gallant Grahams"" and ""Lads O' the Fair"". If you have never purchased a cd by the Battlefield Band, I would heartily recommend this one as your first!"
1,Misleading title: Missing audia CD,"This book was delivered to me without the audio CD even though it says in the title that it comes with one. This is a significant problem because it is for a French conversation class so almost all of the activities are based around answering questions about the french conversations on the CD! The book does have some writing throughout it, but luckily it's in pencil so it can be erased."
4,Informative and yet not too heavy,"This is a good introduction to the fascinating religious utopian sect. I had read other more detailed works about Shakers in general. The last of the Shakers live nearby in Maine. This work was more helpful on understanding Ann Lee, for all practical purposes the founder of the Shakers. It doesn't get you lost in footnotes and scholarly apparatus, but the sources are there if you want them. Reads like a novel."
2,Not for removing stock castle nuts,"If you are buliding or putting together an AR this may be fine. I bought 2, one for a friend. Both broke trying to remove stock collapsible stocks, had to go to a pipe wrench. If your rear stock came from the factory this wont budge it."
2,"It works, but that's all.",The product IS as advertised and does work; but only marginally so. No complaints for the price; it is as expected.
3,Just stick with your original Pink Floyd cd's,"This CD is a tribute to the music of Pink Floyd. All of the tracks sound very similar to the originals, but are instrumentals. The instruments and sound effects occasionally sound too synthesized ... particularly the crowd noise before Run Like Hell and In the Flesh.The best song on the album is ""In the Flesh,"" which has a nice electric guitar to replace the vocals. The bottom line for this CD is that the music is good, but it's too close to the original to make it worth most people's money. If you want a tribute with some originality, I recommend the ""Saucerful of Pink"" 2-cd album.Since Amazon.com doesn't list the tracks (at least, they didn't when I wrote this review), here's the list: Money, Run Like Hell, Another Brick In The Wall, Time, Us & Them, Comfortably Numb, In The Flesh, The Great Gig In The Sky"
2,Pink Floyd Karaoke,Nice instrumental versions of classic Floyd But not essential unless you are a diehard Floyd Freak. Ideal if you have always wanted to do Floyd Karaoke
5,Para toda persona sin importar edad,"Este libre explica sobre la sexualidad, el porque y las causas y efectos de abusar de ella. Si tienes dudas sobre el sexo, si tuviste sexo sin querer y ahora no sabes que hacer. Este libro es para ti. Padres excelente herramienta en la educacion de sus hijos."
3,En defensa de los ateos,"Con gran estusiasmo he leído casi todos sus libros y me siento profundamente identificado con ellos, al grado que he comenzado ha aplicarlos en mi vida. Pero en ""Juventud en Extasis 2"" no me gusto algunas aseveraciones que usted hace. Principalmente con respecto a los ateos. Me considero ateo, más por verdadera convicción que por simple falta de educación religiosa o de cualquier tipo. Soy de las personas que se cuestiona la vida y que a pesar de no tener. Me gustaría que muestre mayor objetividad al escribir y reconozca que existen cosas en el mundo que si no se sienten no se conocen. Le agradezco el gran mensaje que hasta el momento me ha dado."
1,El libro más ruin y deshonesto que he leido,Es muy lamentable que esta basura sea utilizada con intenciones de educación y formación de aquellos quienes inician el gusto de descubrir su sexualidad. Pocas cosas son tan tristes y desesperanzadoras como jovenes con ideas atávicas. A pesar de esto respeto muchisimo la diversidad y si algún incauto tiene la defortuna de leer esta basofia sugiero que se vacune leyendo mucho y bien para contrarrestrar el efecto que causa leer las estupideces que el señor Sanchez suelta desde la cima de su olimpica ignorancia .
3,Nightmare b4 xmas keychain,I bought this because I love Nightmare Before Christmas and Jack Skellington rocks the only thing I hated was that the price was ridiculous and I thought I was going to get 4 not just one. I mean if your going to sell something and it's just one item then use just that item not four different ones and making people think they're getting 4 and not one. Not appreciated.
1,Beware of the remakes,"These are wonderful songs done by one of the forgotten artists of the '60s, BUT if you want the original sound that made them classics (featuring the innovative steel guitar of Lloyd Green), you'll be disappointed with this CD. Remakes are almost always never as good as the original versions, and this CD is no exception. Please, MCA, get a Warner Mack compilation drawn from the original masters out ASAP!"
1,Terrible - Don't waste your money,"This is quite possibly the worst documentary film I have ever watched. I didn't watch the last 9 films here - the first one was so terrible I couldn't quite make it through it. So these comments apply only to the first film - ""The Revolutionary War - Pt. 1""The narration is by a single male monotone uninteresting voice throughout - sounds like he's just reading a script. The musical background selections are often too loud - competing with the insipid narration. The information presented in the film is probably ok, it's just presented in such a boring way as to make it almost intolerable to watch.For a good, high quality survey of American History, I would recommend the History Channel's ""America: The Story of US"" available on DVD and Blu-ray."
5,Excellent and rare......,"Includes many tracks unavailable in this country, and has an inner sleeve with important info on how to get other CD's in the series."
1,Broken Item,"The ring that I bought would be beautiful, but it was broken. I tried to return it, but sending it back to Thailand is a hassle. Should Iknow that the return is such a hassle i WOULD NOT even bother to buy it."
1,The Quiet Art of Watching Ducks,"Unless you like activities such as watching paint dry, this is the worst video of all time. In fact, watching paint dry would be FAR more engaging, informative, and entertaining."
4,"19 songs of ""pure country""","One of the all-time country greats who is often overlooked these days. In this cd, you get a sampling of the hits and classic album cuts from the 50's and early 60's. Stonewalls music is ""real country"" at it's very best."
5,An Important Book For ALL Parents,"Although I am not yet a parent, I was intrigued by the issues this book brings to light - as I have known many children who've felt stuck in the middle due to divorce.This is one of those books that ALL parents can gain insights from! It is a compilation of letters written to a judge by children whose parents were in the midst of a divorce. Some of the letters will actually make you laugh, and others will make your heart hurt. But each one shares important insights into the minds & hearts of children who are dealing with these difficult issues.This should be used as a handbook for divorcing parents - as it allows a peek into what hurts & what can heal these children who are trying to understand why, and what next...I would highly recommend this book to all parents, but especially those who are in the midst, or are contemplating divorce. It's an easy, eye-opening read!"
5,A Book for All Parents,"The letters in this book are all real letters written by real kids expressing their honest feelings about divorce and they give the reader much food for thought. In some cases the kids seem more mature and more responsible than their parents, and one of the most important messages I gained from this book is that we must take the time to listen to our kids--really listen to them with our hearts as well as with our ears. A most revealing and insightful glimpse into the minds and hearts of our children. Highly Recommended!"
4,Reloading Time,"Compared with their masterpiece Mood Swings this 1998 album has more modern rock taste. So Blind, Reload(my #1 favorite) show their direction toward wholesome American modern pop rock. This might not please die-hard Harem Scarem fans who love early albums. But songwriting skills shown in every track of this album is top-rateAs a new Harem Scarem fan who instantly fell in love with Mood Swings I find relieved to hear the songs like Seas of Dissession reminding me of MS.In retrospect this album was the premonition to the Rubber, launch of new era of their career."
1,Gross!,"I read the reviews of this bar and the other bars by designer whey and I was convinced enough to buy 2 boxes. These bars are really bad. The taste is horrible and if that's not bad enough, they leave a very strong fake sugar after taste in your mouth that doesn't seem to go away. Really awful. I bought these because I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the bar that I had been buying Paleobar. After tasting these I went right back to Paleobar, it's worth the extra 1.50 a bar to have something that I actually look forward to eating."
3,"Tastes okay, but had aftertaste","Sorry I have to disagree with the other reviewers. While the texture and initial flavor of the Detour bar is pretty good, there is a horrible aftertaste, so I won't be buying these again. I've tried many protein bars, energy bars, low-carb high-protein bars, etc. and my favorites are manufactured by EAS."
1,Air Filter,I was very disappointed in these filters. First they are not 25 inches by 20 inches by 4 inches. They are not well made. They are rather flimsy. They are approximately 3 and 1/2 inches thick. This left a 1/2 gap in my furnace filter compartment that caused an irritating rattle and an improper air seal. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5,A seminal look at the woman and the city,"The first half of the twentieth century was filled with constant change and development; it was an exciting time to be alive. ""A Journey into Dorothy Parker's New York"" is a focus on the woman herself, but a bigger focus on the city she lived in and its constant change through two world wars, a great depression, and so much more events. Filled with countless photos, both color and black and white, ""A Journey into Dorothy Parker's New York"" is a seminal look at the woman and the city, sure to please fans of her work and New Yorkers alike. ""A Journey into Dorothy Parker's New York"" is highly recommended for community library biography collections and students of the history and culture of New York City."
1,Very bad quality!,This plugs have a very poor quality.. actualy I dont think that they are made by bosch.. I used them for around 2 month and then they stop working properly and the terminals doesnt work very good..they disconnect very easy..
2,did not like,I got the plug wires quickly...thats a good thing.How ever judging the condition of the box and the fact that the spark plug end of the wires are 180 degrees off from the coil ends makes me think that the wires were brought back as defects and sent to me. I had to install the wires by twisting them a little and I beleive that will lead to failure. I had to put the car back on the road so I guess I'm stuck.
3,"Not 14"" Wide!","I bought this for my sister's wedding. She was looking for a cake plate with a 14"" top. This has a 14"" dimension, but it's not the top. The top only measures a little over 12"". I don't know where the 14"" measurement is made, but don't by this thinking its the surface for the cake."
5,Good book for those interested in writing and education.,"The author serves us well by clarifying the idea of democratization of writing instruction, which began in the nineteenth century schools. It is the method of asking students to write about their own experiences, rather than following the works of great writers. As a result of her work the question can now be raised about which method makes for a better education. The author includes some interesting student essays, for example one from 1846 about the moral dangers of reading novels."
2,Doesn't work for me.,"I LOVE the Swingle Singers. The first time I heard them sing Bach back in the 60's I was driving a car and I was so blown away that I had to pull off the road. And I LOVE Irving Berlin's music; his message is simple and direct and tuneful. And therein lies the rub. To me, the jazz vocal styles, the contemporary harmonies and the whimsical utterances of the Swingle Singers go together with Irving Berlin's music like oil and water; they just don't mix. The words and melodies are those of Irving Berlin but the end result isn't Irving Berlin. Admittedly this is one man's opinion, and others might take great pleasure in the Swingle Singers' unfailing virtuosity and inventiveness. But if you anticipate the straighforward tunes and emotional directness in Berlin's music, you are apt to be disappointed."
5,The BEST dog shampoo!,"If you are tired of bathing your dog only to have the ""doggy odor"" return in a day or so, then this is the dog shampoo for you! The fresh scent of this shampoo lasts for up to 2 weeks! I have been using this shampoo exclusively for the past 18 years. It leaves their coats smooth as silk and smelling Fresh 'n Clean! Great product....."
5,Lambert Kay Shampoo,"I purchased this from a company I had not ordered from previously. The gallon jug came with the foil already peeled back. I called the company, not thinking about contacting Amazon.com first, and they were great to deal with. Amazon.com did contact after hearing from the company but I was unable to take the call at the time. The company sent out another gallon jug and sent me the info I needed to return it at no cost to me and when they received the return refunded my money."
2,Not Happy,"I have used this product in years past and scent is not as strong or did the smell stay on my dog past 2 days and used to stay for weeks. Not happy with this product, very disappointed and the dog people I groom for thought the same, product scent weakened."
2,Wrong size displayed - it's not Youth but Kid sizes,"Buyers be aware: this is not Youth size, as indicated in the product description, but rather Kid size. I gave this as a gift, so it caused some trouble for the recipient - they had to exchange.What makes this troubling is since they don't have a size chart, I had to call the company (a third-party company - not amazon). Their customer service was available on a Sunday afternoon and was reasonably polite, but they didn't give me any heads up either about the sizing error."
1,This drive is JUNK,"The first time I used the drive it took several tries for the system to see it. I got errors and it kept powering off. I reformatted it and it was fine after that (or so I thought) and I was able to back up my drive.The second time I used the drive it just started clicking, then it went clank, and then it was dead. End of story, just like that. Now it's on it's way back to Seagate for replacement. I guess I am lucky I found out during a routine backup and not when I needed the data on the drive. I hope the replacement has the problem fixed, but from the reviews here at Amazon, I am not going to get my hopes up.I wish I would have read the reviews on Amazon.com before I bought that drive."
1,Crap in XP...,"Lots and Lots and Lots and Lots of ""Delayed write failed"" data lost errors... Seagate doesn't know why... Microsoft doesn't know why... DON'T buy... I have tried 2 of these.. returning both. HARDWARE DEFECT, talked to Seagate, and after a full YEAR, they finally replaced my units with fully WORKING drives..."
1,Never ever buy this crap,"I bought this to take backup of my digital photo backup. What happened is, I lost everything!!! Everything. I couldn't beleive my ears when I heard this huge clicking sound (it's the ""head crash"") coming out from this hard drive after a few weeks of purchase. After this sound this hard drive is just a junk. I don't care anything about customer services, who replied lile ""we don't do data recovery...."", it's just a crap. Som don't even think about it. You don't want to waste your money on this one."
1,Don't do it!,"Just wanted to add to the list of reviews. I've had the same problems listed here. I will never buy Seagate products again. Talking to customer service and a project manger there I have come to the conclusion that a bunch of retarded monkeys with lisps run Seagate.Bought it 2/18, broke 2/18, notified Seagate 2/19, still have no replacement drive. I have gotten conflicting information everytime that I have communicated with anyone at Seagate. Also there was much confusion as my first warranty request was lost and I had to do it again thus delaying everything more. I cannot stress how horribly this company is run (at least the departments I've dealt with).I'm getting angry typing this, gotta go get a beer."
1,Crash! 300 Gig Crashed within 2 days!,"I Highly would not recomend the Seagate 300gig External Hard Drive to Anyone. I lost 250 gigs of data. The thing lasted 2 days, thats riddiculas! And whats Seagate goin to do. . . ? You'll be luck if you can get threw on there support line, and dont believe when they say they'll call you back. Bad Move, Never Again. I call it SeaSh*t !"
1,POS,Worked good -- actually got one complete backup onto it. Didn't use it for 3 months. Then wanted to update the backup. Found the FireWire port no longer worked. Used the USB instead to do another backup.... noticed that 1 hour later it was backing up the same file. Found that the harddisk had powered down. POS. Also received several Write Delay errors. Summary: POS
1,Stay away from these drives.,"Our organization ordered 2 of these drives and 2 of the 300 GB variety of these drives. All 4 of them experienced write problems as indicated in the previous reviews.The drive would be just humming along fine, and then suddenly write errors would start popping up in the system log.We experienced these problems with both linux using the 2.4 kernel and Mac OS X. Based on the previous reviews here, and my own experience with 4 of the drives under two different operating systems/machine architectures I can only conclude that these drives have some serious design/engineering problems and should definitely be avoided."
1,3 drives in all. Delayed write failed,"I'm not going to bash any one here. Originally the warranty department was a bit difficult to deal with but after I was put in touch with a specific person regarding my issues...well I cannot say I've had better service.I'm working withWindows 2000 ProfessionalAMD XP 1700 Processor768mb of Memory740gb of internal hard drive spaceECS K7s5a mother boardI tried all the suggestions regarding disabling anti virus software or any other software that would be running in the background, disconnecting any other USB 2 devices and still had the problem.I also know of one other individual that has encountered the error who was running Windows XP.Seagate has provided a solution but the issue with the drive was never resolved."
1,IT DIED,"So I have been using this external hard drive for quite some time, perhaps a year and a half or so.It's worked fine all that time.And then last week, it died.I called seagate to find out when the warranty had expired, it expired last May!!!I think it was actually less than a year when it expired.I should have read these reviews before buying it."
5,A real chill Compilation,"Summer Chill is what a chill cd should sound like. It starts of at a good tempo and slowly descents into a chill out experience. Best tracks are Alex Cortiz's ""Lounge Theme"", Wah Mui's ""You Don't Love Me"", Stryke's version of the Bill Wither's classic ""Ain't No Sunshine"" and Moving Images ""Mile's Mood"" feat. Herb Alpert. Summer Chill is a chill out experience"
4,A must have for chill out fans!,"A very wide range of smooth tracks on this comp. Everything from Trip hop to Celtic! It all flows well together however aided by subtle mixing. Stand out cuts include Stryke's gorgeous cover of Bill Wither's ""Ain't No Sunshine"" and Shantel's dub trip ""All I Want""Perfect music for summer sunset. A very cool and diverse collection."
2,Missing parts,"I have used this part before with excellent results, but the packaging on this shipment was bad. I have tried to contact Amazon about the problem, but still have not had any response from them.Belkin is quality equipment, but if you cannot get the full order I would suggest trying another vendor. Amazon is so big that two missing parts from my shippment has no impact on there business.Mike"
1,OVERPRICED,"The filter is as advertised, but over priced at $30....other vendors carry this filter for less than half that. Visit the filterfast website...."
4,Does the job.,"This little machine does the job. Just to list the cons, on high it is loud, yet my husband an I love it to sleep by. Second, the filters for this air machine is on the pricey side. But the dirt you see on it is worth th price. We are pretty well satisfied, after having it for 5 months."
3,What?,"When I read the reviews, someone posted that you get a two pack for this price. Not so. You only get one. Although it is a perfect fit for my Hunter 30711, it is way to expensive. I could have gotten a 2-pack from another company for $37 + S/H. I am very disappointed. FYI : Don't believe everything you read!"
3,Good Overall,"This works for sure, but the reason why I am giving it a 3 stars ONLY is because of the price. Hoping they lower it in the low $20s instead of mid-$30s. Rip-off, I think. Who would want to spend $35+ every 3 months?"
5,Journey to the Center of a Soul,"This is an artist's album... tasty, original, and heartfelt, with a delicious reverie of lyrics, phrasing, grooves and acoustic instruments. I've listened to it a thousand times and I'm still in love... you can choose to glide on its surface or dive in for a continually unique listening experience. My only wanting is for Track 2 (There Once Was a Time) to go on and I hope Andriette will consider doing an extended version in the future."
5,Kids love it,"I have to strongly disagree with other reviews of this item. My sister purchased this DVD for her son, and for over a year or so (he's now 3 and a half) he begged to watch it every chance he got. He even requests to see it now and sings along with it. My daughter turned a year old in September and my sister (almost as a joke) bought it for her. She LOVES it. Every day, she points at the TV and says ""Holiday"" (which is what my nephew calls the DVD because of the title of the first song.) I will admit that it is somewhat dated and the tunes aren't all that appealing to an adult, but come on, are the Wiggles? Barney? No. They're appealing to kids, and that is who the DVD is meant for. My daughter tries to sing along with the songs and even does the hand motions for a few of them. My sister says she's going to buy this DVD for 1st birthdays for all of the kids that she knows and I have to agree, It's a great gift."
3,very simple,This book can be a very helpful one if you're looking for simple designs.It is a sample of flower motifs mostly english and french from the 19th century and some oriental motifs as well.It is all black and white patterns and it looks a lot like a coloring book.It is an OK book if you're starting with the idea but very simple if you want to go indepth.I would recommend it if you're interested in crafts in general and also if you work with kids.
4,Great book but dont order via the market place,"This is a very good book with some basic designs. If you are a beginning woodworker or have some basic tools, you can build one of these. As pointed out, the design is simple, but it is flexible and you can customize your own design. I build a surround from stain grade birch with pine trim and moulding. It was finally painted white and primed. We are very happy. I give the book 4 stars, ..."
2,Lots of Pics - little words,"This book is basic with lots of pictures. Looks like the authors had fun over the weekend, shot some photos and published it."
5,This is one fun book!,"Cynthia Boris has assembled a high-stakes (sorry!) collection of fun and challenging questions on the first two seasons of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Buffy fans of all ages will get a kick out of it, and will also get to test their knowledge of the show and the characters. The book is well designed and it's easy to find the answers to those questions that absolutely slay you. Required to have on hand at your next ""Buffy"" get-together."
4,great book,"great quiz. it is more fun if you can get another buffy fan to take it with you. i did decent, considering i started watching in july of last year. but the books have caught me up on some of the earlier episodes so i was not a total dunce. but this book is a must for all fans."
3,Tamed,"After the failure of ""Klondike Annie,"" Mae West tried something different: an adaptation of someone else's material. ""Personal Appearance"" was a stage play about a big star stuck in a small town, and in the early scenes of the film, she is fairly funny as she plays the star as vain, ignorant, and self-obsessed. This brief bit of satire is promising, but the film soon becomes the usual West vehicle, with various slickers and studs after the irresistable heroine. This is the rare West film with a strong supporting cast, and it passes fairly pleasantly, but the censors were at their strongest -- and Mae without double entendres isn't really Mae."
4,One of West's Best,"Marvis Arden (Mae West) is a sensational movie star. Her following spans the world and her personal appearance tours prove her popularity. On her way home from one such appearance, Arden's car breaks down. She orders her publicity man (Warren William) to find her a place to stay, suspicious that he planned the break down to keep her away from a man. However, she soon finds herself mooning over an attractive repairman in town (Randolph Scott) and listening to his ideas about inventing equipment for film.West is wonderful as always in this breezy and enjoyable movie. She has many snappy quips, especially brilliant since she wrote the script herself. It is always exciting to see Hollywood parodying itself and its stars. The visual elements are quite good, especially the opener. The story is somewhat typical of West because she is out seducing men, but it is unusual because it involves typical country folk. Great fun!"
3,Before You Pay for This...,"Just a note to fellow ""Amazoners"". The excerpt that you see on the Amazon site is 118 words in length. (Yes, I verified this number with the Unix ""wc"" utility :-) The whole article, if the number can be trusted in the item description is only 600-some-odd words long.I can't imagine what would appear in the remaining 500-or-so words that could be worth $10.I'd let somebody else pony up the money and report back to us!"
5,A favorite bedside book,"This is a compilation of Tibetan and Buddhist tales, similar in a way to Zen Flesh Zen Bones (which I also love). The difference is the language is much simpler, smoother, and accessible. Who would have thought Buddhism could be so funny at times? It's a great way to get into the spirit of things, without laboring over it. I just love this book."
4,Tibetian mini tales,"This book is a compilation of spiritual short stories from Tibet. The typical story is only a page or two, so not much depth is possible in any given story. A full range of subjects within Buddism are presented, including spiritual, inspirational, enlightening, insightful, fictional, non-fictional, humorous, and sad. I enjoyed the vast majority of the stories to some degree.In addition to the spiritual value of the book, it is also rich with the culture of Tibet.My only problem with the book was that by and large the stories were unrelated in terms of plot and characters. Finishing one story did not leave me wanting to read ""just one more"" before putting it down.With that in mind, this book would be perfect as a ""bathroom reader"".Entertainment: 3.5 starsEnlightenment: 4.5 starsOverall: 4 stars"
3,A little confusing,The book was downloaded with no problem at all. But I find the layout a little poor. The tales on the other hand are great!
3,Not very catchy.,"This book didn't catch my attention very easily. A three seemed like a good rating because, in my opinion, it has to catch my attention right away."
4,Looking Good dead,This book was as good as the other novels by Peter James. It had everything in it that I have come to expect from the author and i plan to read more of his books
4,Looking Good Dead,This is what I expect from Peter James. A book that I hate to put down. I love the excitement from his story lines and if you like a book that takes you on a roller coaster ride this it. You don't get any boring bits. A good murder mystery that you can get right into.Buy it - you will like it.
3,Why can't I re-read a book on my kindle?,Two things I don't like about my Kindle. The position of the forward/backwards is in the spot most comfortable to hold. I keep accidentally turning the page.The kindle won't let me re-read a book unless I go back page by page to the beginning.
3,A refreshingly local crime novel-but flawed,"I really enjoyed the story and was completely engrossed.....up until the point where the characters are drinking alcohol!!! Please don`t add to the text ""Sho whats happening,I`m sho tired"" no!!!!!! please, people don`t talk like that. Great stories, but I can`t put up with any more. Its not just me, my wife thinks the same, and she apparantly knows everything."
3,Geneological Help,"This is a first for me with writing a review but since I have gotten involved with putting the family history in book form. I have needed many extra reseach books. The Surname Detective is just what it claims. It give family names and traces the movement into different parts of the original country and immigrations of the families. The maps are helpful to me. I do think it is over priced because it is not an everyday working or reading volume and it is generic. But if you are wondering about your family name and can afford it, I always recomend factual data."
4,The Mountain King,"I'm buying another copy of this book, to keep. I've loaned my first copy to many people and I don't know where it went. I just hope it is being passed on to others. Being a native West Virginian I find the story very entertaining. Many ideas seem would seem ordinary to me except that my twenty years in the Air Force gives me a larger prespective. It seems to me that the power of common sense is getting to be an uncommon virtue. tfs"
4,School Daze poems,"David Harrison's poems may inspire youngsters to write their own poems about school, covering the same territory: food, gum, the ""brain"", science fun, teachers, field trips. The print size is nice and big for young readers, and illustrations are bright and cheery. Not as strong as Jack Prelutsky's school poems, but inspiring for young writers nonetheless."
3,Not the real deal,I had to create a brand new amazon ID for myself to write this review because even admitting that one had read this can be toxic to one's career.It's obvious to me (as a former student of chemistry) that Fester never made LSD himself. It's also clear that he didn't spend enough time researching the subject. The first edition had several errors in it - some of them due to bad proof reading but others due to mistakes Fester made because of a rushed job. This is much better but still ... a person looking for good advice on how to make LSD should investigate Shulgin's Tihkal ... I definitely get the impression that Shulgin has either made LSD himself or is one intimate terms with someone who did.So why am I giving this 3 stars if I think it's so bad? Because the book is not a complete waste. I rather admire the notion that someone like Fester would spend so much time writing subversive books like this. His freedom-loving spirit is refreshing in these conformist and authoritarian times.
5,The Cowardice of Amnesia rocked my world,"Ellyn Maybe's voice is a unique combination of sincere compassion and an appreciation of the absurd. The message throughout is clear: be kind to your beautiful self, the rest will come easily. Inspirational, moving, not a word wasted. Though the poems are long, they don't feel long; they are economically crafted and free of cliche. The work is directly accessible--no academic snobbery whatsoever. Ellyn Maybe's voice will continue to be an important one for many generations."
4,Horrific and tragically suspenseful,"After reading this book, its hard to believe that our Judiciary Courts let the convicts actual get away with murder. Jane Wells has really captured how the Social Services are unable to help people that are on the borderline or are in desperate need of help. After seeing her on the Montel Show, she had sparked my interest in her book. I not only cringed but cried when she and her daughters had to face such unnecessary barriers that were put by the system. I pray and hope to God that she is able to stay undercover from her ex-husband and that the children, especially the oldest can have a peaceful life and never have to suffer the torment and abuse that had been suffered by them all. My prayers are with Jane Wells and family. God Bless...."
5,The truth,"After reading this book, it amazes me what some people have to go through during their lifetime. The fact that Jane even survived is relieving. Reading her book made me feel as though I wish I could have been her friend at that time and helped her through all the tough stuff she was dealing with. On another note, imagine what poor Erica and Megan had to go through! If my dad were to die, I would freak, but if I were only six and were to see it happen I don't know how I would ever get over it. I am happy though, that I met Jane personally and she seems like a very cheerful person and made me happier that day. I think everyone should read this book to let them know that what they are going through could be worse."
3,Not the best writing,"I am not saying this was not a good book. The story was thrilling and I kept having to remind myself that this was a true story and not fiction. However, it was horribly written. It jumped around a lot from one page to another and I had to keep turning back to make sure I did not skip something. There were times in the book where she would describe something the cops brought up that she had mentioned to them but she never mentioned the events to the reader or she would just skip days, weeks, or months and not even give a basic breakdown of what happened or even alert the reader that time had elapsed. After reading the epilogue and afterward all I heard was her go ""me, me, me"" and wanted her to shut up. I get that she went thorough something awful and pulled herself out of it but someone else should have written her story. I am glad I only paid $1 for this book and actually bought it intending to give to a friend so it will not waste space on my bookshelf."
4,ok book,"i just finished this book it was ok but i think jane should have told more in the biggening about what she went throgh then on and on, it didnt tell much about what she went through as she was married."
2,No good!!,"All ya'll gotsta' be crazy!! This is terrible work from one of the greatest. I've tried many times to bump this disc and can't feel any kind of flow or groove, and I've asked many people to do the same...they say the same thing. Don't get me wrong though, I will still support Paul Wall, Watts, Jones, and the whole Swishahouse crew, but c'mon now, who ya'll kiddin??...Now, with that said, Paul Wall's new disc, The People's Champ, is kickin'!! Every song has good flow, good beat, good bass, and collaborations are on point...Buy the People's Champ instead!!..."
3,"Better then most, not as good as his other stuff.","While not Paul's best work, there is still amazing skill on each track!"
1,Very disappointing Kapustin,"While the performance of Beethoven is fine, I have found Kato's interpretation of Kapustin to be awkward, with random rubati and odd dynamics. Kapustin must be interpreted with a keen sense of rhythm which the pianist lacks, with a continual drive that holds the piece together. Instead, it is interpreted as a slightly intoxicated, overly melancholic classical pianist may."
4,accordian and romantic mandolin lovers,"If you love the accordian and mandolin, this is a great CD with many favourites. If you have italian parents or grand parents, they'll surely sing along!"
1,No words,"Lots of anticipation after reading about her on her site. Then I got the album and it didn't really live up. But, I did like the picture on the front.Next time, I'll listen to the samples before investing the money."
3,HARD TO READ,"I HAVE READ ABOUT 3/4 OF THE BOOK, AND IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD TO GO THROUGH IT. THE SUBJECT IS FASCINATING, I WONDER IF MR. SHELDRAKE COULD HAVE MADE IT MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE."
2,Keep Looking for Signs of Life,"I think there might be some very good ideas buried somewhere in this dense, pompous prose. The book's writing style is very archaic and inaccessible for the average reader ... think academic audience here. The editors didn't do Sheldrake any favors here by letting him run amok with his thesis project. Fine, if I had picked up this book in the University's book store ... but not mainstream Amazon."
4,Good intro to advanced composites,"There aren't too many good books on the fabrication and repair of structures that use high modulus fibers like Carbon and Kevlar, modern core materials, and high performance resins. While this British title ""goes on a bit"" and is not for the illiterate, it does an excellent job of walking you through the process of building and repairing parts that would not be out of place on any track in the country. It will also be useful to airplane and boat builders."
5,Best Ever,"I lost one of the earrings so i purchased another set. I have 4 piercings on my ear and these look elegant, can be worn as pearl or gold studs, and have remained securely on my ear for 3 years now."
1,Vinotemp Wine Refrigerators are unreliable,"I have a VT-60 which I spent almost $700 for and which died within 2 years. There were no authorized repair places within 120 miles for years 3 and 4. Finally, one showed up within 70 miles. I took my wine cooler there and they didn't even know what a Vinotemp wine refrigerator was. Anyway, they told me I had to order a relay switch in order for them to determine what was wrong with the refrigerator. I have been waiting about 3 months for the relay switch and Vinotemp moved the estimated ship date of the part another 2 weeks again. The customer service representative that I spoke to about this new delay was marginally rude. I purchased a small ""normal"" refrigerator for my game room for less than $200 and it has run well for almost 4 years. There is something incredibly wrong with the Vinotemp business model which apparently does not include a quality system nor inventory control."
1,"""Romantic Suspense"" Novel Without Romance or Suspense","Mary Stewart, one of the finest romantic suspense novelists of all time, has written a novel without any romance or suspense. This whisper of a book contains the lovely scenic descriptions of her earlier novels but the ""mystery"" amounts to a break-in at an empty house and the ""romance"" amounts to a semester together at Cambridge in the fall. The heroine is an emotionless school-marm who is so stern and prim that she is bascially an 80-year-old masquerading as a ""dish."" After enjoying such great mysteries as The Moon-Spinners and This Rough Magic, I thought for sure that something was going to happen. But the only excitement was the occasional sighting of a petrel (a very shy bird). Whoa! It is clear that Miss Stewart, in her dotage, lost all interest in love and danger, and was captivated only by nature and wildlife. This is not a bad thing but she should have stopped writing ficton and become an author of travel books."
2,"Not up to her great books before the ""Arthur"" trilogy.","I was delighted to discover new novels by Mary Stewart, who had long delighted me with her beautifully done mystery/romance novels. However, many of her books from the 1980s and '90s, while having the same wonderful flavor and verbiage, are weak on plot. I knew who the love interest would be far too long in advance, for example. And the ""big mystery"" turned out to be much ado about nothing. Might want to check it out of the library before purchasing a copy. Stewart's Thornyhold, however, was much better -- more like her old writings."
1,Author burnout,This is a classical tale of an author burning out. Old age finally caught up with Mary Stewart. She never wrote another story after this one as far as I know. I keep a copy to show my students how not to live off yuor past glories when there's nothing left in the pot. Awful and flat.
3,Definitely not her best,"""The Stormy Petrel"" falls short of Mary Stewart's normal caliber of work. The main character, Rose, is a don at Cambridge and rents a cottage on a Gaelic island to write. ""Adventure"" follows her.As compared to Stewart's other works, this ""adventure"" is dull and not really a mystery at all. From the beginning, you know who the bad guy is. There really isn't any suspense.A good thing is that Stewart always does a nice job with setting, and this is no exception.One complaint I have is that several storylines aren't satisfactorily tied up. Rose is secretly a science fiction author. Her writing is a subplot, but it isn't really fully developed. One person figures it out, but it's a ""so what?"" moment. The romance is more of a fizzle than a sizzle, as is the entire book."
2,Only Okay,This is definatly not Mary Stewart at her best. I found this book very lacksidasical and totaly unintresting. Tell me what is romantic about this book? I won't get a awnser because there isn't. I was very disapointed in this book. After having read Moonspiners and the Ivy tree. Currently I am reading the Merlin Trilogy which is absolutly fantastic.The Stormy Petrel is nonromance all the way. The only romance in the whole book is when she had s smile on her face thinking of her next fall semester term.If you think that thats romance you must not know excitment. If you must read this book though read it for the nature stuff she talks about.
2,Skip this,"Please skip this book. It had me going for a while, and I was excited. But I like a little surprise in my books, and this had none! Too predictable. And I HATED Rose and her love interest! BLAH!!!!!"
3,Dean Martin on Reprise is cool,"The King of Cool no less. Unfortunately this CD suffers from a couple of terminal faults. There is a nice scratching sound which occurs just prior to track one starting up. And some clever sound technician decided to cut off the first few bars of 'I Will' - very annoying.Other than those, the CD includes some mighty good stuff. 'Little Green Applies' is incredibly decent - although they didn't really need to include the sound of the studio exploding into applause at the end of the track... kinda kills the moment a tad."
1,Unlistenable.,"This album could give pretentious, melodramatic drivel a bad name. After hearing this sonic mishap, I grimace every time I hear ""Tainted Love"" -- not because I dislike that song, but because having a radio hit at one time probably helped Marc Almond to get A Virgin's Tale made."
3,Not her best video,This is not one of her best tapes. As one reviewer already pointed out this is a jogging tape and I was looking for a low impact tape (her walk aerobics tapes). Get her miracle mile or 2 mile walk tapes and you will never look for another instructor.
5,Oldie But Goodie,"Conducting two exercise classes means that we use a big variety of Leslie Sansone's tapes. Yes, this is a jogging tape, but after viewing it once I was able to substitute low impact moves in place of the high impact ones Leslie leads you through on the tape. Nothing hard about it. It's great for mixed classes, as beginners and intermediates can follow my easier moves while the more advanced can jog right along with Leslie. Good job Leslie!"
5,great stuff,"Lizano sauce is delicious and hard to find locally. My entire family loves it on rice, fish and other stuff."
5,Maybe the only book you will need...,"...for the new cisco Switching exam. I have read BOTH the cisco press and sybex study guides and would have to say that this book eclipses the both of them. Having said that though, using this book with the cisco press book (and the Bosons) would just about guarantee you success....(be sure to get at least some hands-on switch experience - at least for the commands and their output).All in all - this book is truly fantastic. Buy it!"
4,Good enough to pass,"This is the only book I read on switching and I scored 956 out of 1000 on the 640-504. I was, however, fortunate enough to have the equipment to test all of the commands in this book, which helped me remember them. If you don't have the equipment to familiarize yourself with the commands, you'd better come up with a very good memorizing mechanism. I only saw 2-3 questions on the exam not covered in this book. Another 2-3 questions went a little deeper than what the book covered, but this book gives you enough info to make a very good educated guess at the least."
5,"Excellent ""exam cram""","This is an excellent study material for preparation toward CCNP 2.0. I used it together with Cisco Press book and it's everything you need to pass the exam. Also, for those interested in having a good knowledge of the so complex Cisco LAN world grab it fast! In 2 days you'll be a ""MultilayerSwitched Campus Expert"" over a ""Collapsed GEC Backbone""!"
1,Not helpful,"Not a useful study of hosea, not in depth. No explanation. And horrible theology. This is not a commentary, but more of an attempt at a small group bible study guide."
2,Billy Joe Royal - CD,"Beware! This cd has all re-recordings of his great, classic hits! These here are not the original hit versions! These are all very good remakes, however, and a BJR completist would probably want them anyway."
1,Are you sure Joan?,"The story line of the book is delightful. that in itself was worth the buy for me. However, I pur- chased the book for the recipes. That was a mistake. Unless the ingredients (fruits, etc.)on the East Coast are vastly different from ours on the West Coast Joan doesn't use these recipes. I tried a couple, but only a couple. Then I researched how to test a recipe, before wasting my precious fruit and sugar. A lot of her recipes call for 1 1/2 pkg. pectin. Well, let me tell you, that's a lot of pectin. I gave her the benefit of the doubt a couple times and then got a little wiser. For instance the recipe on page 43 makes such a thick glob of goo that one can barely incorporate the sugar. tsk tsk! Personally I'd like her to show me decent results using her recipe, straight from the book. I bet she can't do it. Furthermore, I would actually like reimbursed for the money I spent on the bogus recipes, I'll throw in my time for the learning experience."
5,Kudos from a Contributor to Beat That,"I contributed the recipe for orange buttermilk sherbet that is in ""Beat That"", Ann Hodgman's second volume of the very best recipes in existence (get vol. 1 ""Beat This"" as well). This is a cookbook you'll really cook out of and will tell all your friends about, not only because the recipes are great, but because she's also a hilarious writer. And in the hot dog days of summer, don't forget to make a batch of my fabulous orange buttermilk sherbet. You'll love it."
3,"Not as good as ""Beat This""","Because I'm such a big fan of the author's ""Beat This"" cookbook (which I rated five stars - see my review), I bought this book as soon as it became available While this is a good cookbook, I did not find the recipies as show stopping, and I would have preferred a better variety of dishes and ingredients."
3,Surf&#65533;s up,"Otto and Reggie suspect their dad is up to something when he breaks his usual routine. They can't figure out if he's a secret agent or what. They decide to follow him to see what he's up to, and eventually find him on the beach practicing for the adult surfing meet. The book is not scary, but it is full of surfer slang. It contains about 400 words."
3,For the fans,"I just bought this album and its one of those ""for the fans"" albums. What I mean is that unless you are a die-hard motown fan (which I am) then I dont think its worth buying. Its high point is JUST SAY JUST SAY. The rest is weak. Im a fan of STOP LOOK LISTEN TO YOUR HEART also,but thats about it. Marvin goes disco in some songs but its not his thang! He once said ""I dont want to get up on stage and shake my ass!,I want to sit on stage and croone"". Marv.... you should have took your own advise friend."
3,Good Not Great,"Ah, Berry Gordy masterminded this meeting of his music titans. The result wasn't as good as Ali-Frazier I, or the Thrilla in Manila. It ended up more like Ali-Frazier II, a non-event. The highlights of this album are the songs you'll find on Marvin or Diana's compilations: You are Everything and Stop, Look, Listen.The beauty of this album is its novelty. This isn't as good an album as either artist's best works, but it's something historic, considering that Marvin was at his peak and Diana was ascending higher and higher. So we have Motown to thank for putting these two together.The album's tracks overall are fine but they're not spectacular. I can't overrate it. I do wonder often though how they recorded their parts separately (ie. who would go first? Diana or Marvin?) That is the one thing I think about when listening to this. God bless them both!"
3,A good piece of nostalgia - Special for Soul fanatics!,"This album contains two wonderful scores by Diana Ross and the late (and unforgettable) Marvin Gaye: ""My Mistake (Was To Love You)"", and ""You Are My Everything"". Period.However, if you're a serious Soul music fan, this CD must be in your collection (not yet? Get it right now!), surely you will enjoy the rest of the songs."
4,Motown Heavyweights,"I love this project. I loved it way back and I love it now. I first purchased DIANA & MARVIN on vinyl, now I can have it on CD! Its sounds just great on sundays when I'm home reading the paper, cleaning the house or just chllin'. My favorite cuts: STOP LOOK LISTEN,PLEDGING MY LOVE,YOU ARE EVERYTHING and INCLUDE ME IN YOUR LIFE. These songs are treasures for me, they make you feel all cozy inside!"
4,Marvin&Diana who knew they had Chemistry?,"this Album for me is between 3&half&a 4.the Vocals are tight&the songs are on point.it fits them really well.""My Mistake(was to Love You) was my cut on this album.that song really shows emotions&Captures there Chemistry.while Diana&Marvin weren't buddies they struck a chord with the music.the songs fit them really well."
2,UNIMPRESSED! UNIMPRESSIVE!,"As other reviewers have stated, these 2 artists were both at the top of their game at the time this album was recorded and released. One would have expected the results to be nothing short of a masterpiece, or at least a gem, a highlight in both artists' careers. What a wasted, squandered opportunity to make some classic pop or r&b. Diana Ross sounds way too laid back and tired on most of this uninspired material. ""My Mistake (Was to Love You)"" is by far the highlight of this album, and it's not even close to matching the best material by these 2 vocalists. This was clearly, purely a totally commercial effort that was half-heartedly approached by all involved. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT AND LOST OPPORTUNITY. ""My Mistake"" can easily be found on anthologies of both singers. Can't hold even a small candle to the great duet work by Marvin and Tammi, who always seemed to be 100% invested in the music."
2,picky eaters,"My 4 parakeets won't touch this. They will eat LaFeber Dailey Diet pellets, but not this. If I mix this with the Lafeber pellets, they still won't eat it. I have been trying to get them to eat it everyday for 2 months. No luck."
4,Great little low budget Steampunk story,"Caught this one for free on the web, liked it enough to buy the dvd, The costuming and cinematography are pretty good, the dialog and acting took a little bit of time to warm up to, but found the whole thing to be a fun little romp in a retro future! Like much of scifi, it has the feel of Metropolis,"
4,true fans only,"This volume is good for one thing: the rest of season 2. Apparently they knew they were being cancelled and didn't care about season 3 and just tried really hard to blow as much of the budget as possible ( plus the b.j. cummings character is pregnant and that throws off the original dynamic that makes the show hilarious). So, if you are a true fan, buy it, it contains the rest of season 2 which you need and is great. Season 3 can hit the dumpster though."
3,Not as good as the first volume,"My husband and I both LOVED the first volume. The first disc on Volume 2 carries on the same humor as Volume 1, but after that, it's pretty much downhill. Anita Massengil is gone, and the Porcelain Bidet character that is added to the team is an absolute flop. We are also suddenly and without explanation introduced to a pregnant BJ Cummings, which REALLY throws the humor and flow of the show off. Alas, the true Son of the Beach fan will still find the wisecracks and puns amusing even through the worse episodes. If anything, it's worth getting to complete the show and it's definitely worth it for the rest of Season 2."
4,Fun doings,"This show was one that you either liked or loathed. I liked its combination of dazzling dames, corny humor, ridiculously unlikely plots, and ""over the top"" acting. I specifically got this season because Amy Webber was in it. An incredible brunette, she didn't have to act too much...the bikini did most of the work. Together with the dour blonde who was in all seasons of the show, the muscleman, and of course Tim Stack and the black actress, this little troupe carried off the show. Yes, the show, on its face, was a spoof of Baywatch, pure and simple. However, Baywatch never had any of the convoluted plots that this comedy series had...they were more like spoofs of Bond films than anything else.The show was silliness personified...and I loved it."
5,It was not as funny as I remember,I recieved the item super fast and was packed very carefully. Excellent item. I bought this set in hopes of getting a good laugh like I did when they aired on tv.
4,Pure hillarity for all who play with it,"This is fun for all age groups from 3 to 65 and older, but it's noisy. You can turn the sound off, though."
5,"Son House, King of the Delta","Son House is the most important and influential Delta Bluesman to ever live he was a major influence to Muddy Waters & Robert Johnson and every one else including me. Buy this C.D. it is very essential stuff this is hardcore Delta Blues there are some trks with Son House in a band setting with Willie Brown and others (perfect example of what a DeltaBlues jam session probally sounded like). These are field recordings and I mean they were actually recorded outside on trk.4 ""Shetland Pony Blues"" you actually hear a steam locomotive (train) go buy in the background. If your a aspiring blues guitar player get this if your a fan of the Blues your C.D. collection is seriously lacking if this is not part of it. also get ""Masters of the Delta Blues, The Friends of Charlie Patton"" all of Son Houses earliest recorings are on there (1930) with some other Delta Blues Legends"
5,Ferocious Intensity,"This disc features the ferocious intensity and masterful singing, not to mention beautiful lyrics, of Son House. This material is different than both his original Paramount Recordings and his stuff from the 1960s. He is in great form on this record, and although the liner notes are skimpy and the cd looks like it could have been manufactured by a fourteen year old boy who downloads Country Blues all day (reminds me of me, just a decade or so ago!), the disc is not only well-worth owning, but is one of the greatest Country Blues cds that I can think of. Every song is excellent, and the driving intensity is relentless. This disc is strongly recommended."
3,Not the best sound,I like Son House but this is not one of the best of his. I just doesn't sound like a good recording. But since I am a blues lover I don't want to give anything less than three stars.
1,Poor quality Japanese Black Dragonfly Sake Set - Four Cups,"Poor quality glaze and dragonfly decoration. Glaze is incomplete in some areas. Dragonfly smeared at wings and incomplete with little or no detail. Dragonfly is brown not gold. Picture is 10x better.""Cloud 9"" the seller should pay more attention to what they sell..no excuse. You make Amazon look bad and waste customer time and trust.This was a gift and I am glad I opened it first. I did not expect poor quality.Thanks to Amazon's return policy and ease of return I will continue my loyality.Thank you Amazon,David Farmer"
5,Saki with elan,This cute little saki set is just perfect. I love the appearance and the style. It sets the stage with elan for our Japanese themed dinners.
4,Harold's stripe shirt,Very happy with the quality and fit of this shirt. I will continue to watch for sales from Harolds.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this toy in the beggining of november and it is now december and i still have not received it. This is a horrible person to buy from, i tryed contacting them about ny order and they changed there email so no one can contact them. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN, EVER!!!!!!!!"
2,Much Smaller Than Hoped,"Even though the product is super, especially all the ad price stickers, the signs were rather small and usless. However the stickers to price things was excellent and saved us tons of time.."
4,Awesome Questions Yearning for Answers,"This is not an easy book to read, and it does not leave the reader satisfied that a cohesive whole has been delivered. Yet that is also the strength of the book. DeCharms has used his knowledge of neuroscience (and an obvious understanding of the basics of Tibetan Buddhism) to interview some of the great teachers of Tibetan mind analysis about the detailed differences between their understanding of mind and that of western science. The result is not an answer but a series of questions calling for further exploration. For those who seek a first understanding of either side of the comparison, this book will be disappointingly unenlightening. For those with some understanding of one or both sides, it offers tantalizing vistas and the opportunity for new insights."
4,VERY GOOD...BUT NOT GREAT!!!,"This collection could have been so much better. That is if you are aware of all the b-sides out their. Clearly the best song on the CD is ""So Many Souls To Change."" And there are some other fine selections included like ""Scared To Live"" and ""Whiskey Remorse."" But this CD failed to recognize more of the awesome singles from the 1989-93 era. This is where their strongest work really shines. This is mostly b-sides from the Waking Hours and Change Everthing albums. Oh well, I guess the rest of us will have to invest in recordable CD players to get the best of the b-sides...."
4,Great for Del Amitri Fans,"I've liked Del Amitri since around their 1992 album, ""Change Everything"". Since that time, pretty everything they've done I've liked. So I guess saying that I liked this album isn't really much of a statement. However, I believe that this collection of B-Sides is just a great example of how this band isn't just the band that did that pop hit, ""Roll To Me"". Del Amitri is just another band that is great but is left basically undiscovered in America. It is a shame because they make good stuff."
4,For the fans,"I guess that B-sides are just exactly that - not good enough to be considered A-sides. Sure there are some throw-away songs here, but there are also some gems too.Fans of the band will want this as will completionists and collectors. If you like their main body of work, then this will not disappoint."
1,Ridiculous Twist Endings,"Kaminsky reminds me a bit of Robert Parker; he struggles with realistic dialogue in passages involving family and relationships. In this case, Abe Lieberman and other Jewish character' speech is too stereotypical, and it had me cringing many times through Terror Town.The book is a decent quick read though, until the ending which strains credibility beyond almost any crime fiction I have ever read. And there isn't just one laughably absurd ""twist"" at the end, but two. And the book would have been fine without either, which really makes it a shame. Who's editing this guy's manuscripts?"
3,good video,Some good ideas on raw food. Production is a bit home spun with a narrator as opposed to having the cook narrate. But still worth a watch if you are looking for vegetarian ideas.
2,Interesting but unreliable,The only trouble with this very interesting and readable book is that its conclusions have long since been discredited by eminent specialists in the field.
1,How Much Longer?,"This girl needs to give it up. Let's see, she can't sing, she won't dance in her videos now, and she's going bald from too much blonde dye. Yes, I'm a hater. I admit it. I used to just love her, but then I heard good music... Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Hoku, No Doubt/Gwen Stefani, the Backstreet Boys, there are so many good choices in pop music! Why settle for some girl moaning about how much Stronger she is? Do any of us really even care?"
5,The Last Day of a Condemned Man: A Classic,"After reading Les Miserables I bought The Last Day of a Condemned Man, I was not expecting an masterpiece like Les Miserables and, because of that, I had such a great surprise, it's a short book but with an energetic message, it shows the horrors of the condemned, the psycological efects in his person when hes own daughter do not recognize him, everiday expecting only death, and with feeling, truth and talent, Victor Hugo show us why the penalty of death is horrendous to anyone."
4,A statement on death penalty,"Victor Hugo `The last days of a condemned man'; more than a distressing tale, is a social comment at the atrocity of the death penalty. He brings a moralistic debate of the authority of government to take life of its citizen. Through the first narrative of the main character whose name and crime is unknown, he describes the torturous moments the captive undergoes up until his time of death. Through these moments he transforms the death penalty from a means of punishment to a state sponsored torture. In the novel he places a sublime message that it is mans tasks to save lives; and its gods to take life. The death penalty becomes a challenge by man to god's authority."
1,The cover is the best part on this book!,"What a disappointment! Anybody with a Kodak instamatic camera can take pictures like this. Stick to photobooks by Leibovitz, Helmut Newton, LaChapelle, and Mark Selliger, and you'll get your money's worth. I wish I never bought this book and will refund it!"
3,Not exactly what I thought.,"I like the book... But I found it somewhat dull. Although the model is very beautiful and the content is playful, I was left wanting more. Ellen Von Unwerth is my favorite photographer nonetheless, but her versatility with themes was nowhere to be found in this book... I recommmedn you buy it only if you are a fan of Ellens' and if you like the model. It is very well done. I kept my copy."
1,Von Unwerth is not the best,"If you want modern photography look up Jeff Wall, he is a true modern artist in this medium. He does not work for fashion magazines and does not spend all his time in New York hopped up on cocain running around taking fuzzy pictures of half naked women. This book was not the best, but I have a few friends who really like it. I don't. Her photographs are exactly like you picture them to be. They are a fanciful look into the glam world without any breath of reality. They are not art and she is not an artist."
2,Impossible Bonnet,Only Marge Simpson could possibly accommodate this out-sized hair bonnet. Material was stiff and edges cut into one's neck. Also almost impossible to stuff back into designated compartment.Too bad; in theory the unit was just what I needed.
4,Works great! Looks good!,"I like everything about this product. It is easy to use and takes up little storage space. However the hood is way too big, unless of course you are drying your Polar bear's hair!"
3,Jerdon Soft Cap Hair Dryer,"It does takes about 10 minutes longer to dry my hair then what was referenced in the instructions mannual for the length of my hair and size of the curlers used. It would be wonderful if the force of the air coming from the unit could be improved. The size of the hose could be longer. There is very little ability to move around because the hose is too short once you are seated in a regular chair and have placed the unit on a table. BUT---It is more gentle on my hair than a curling iron and I have both hands free to put on my make-up, lotion my feet, put oil on my cuticles... while my hair is drying. It is also helpful to heat the soft cap before putting the cap on."
1,This Dryer sucks...,"It is not very powerful. The air does not circulate well and the hose is short. I was never able to fit the bonnet, hose and cord in the tiny carry area. And it died after about 10 uses."
5,Great hooded terry robe,"I have to say this robe is way better than I expected. The texture, weight, length, and luxurious feeling are perfect. My husband loves it."
4,Got it Christmas EVE!!!,I was ABSOLUTELY ECSTATIC when I saw the package at my door Christmas Eve! My husband LOVES it -- thick and not any worse with the lint than any new terrycloth item.I recommend it for the price and quality!
4,The Robe,"I bought this robe for my husband. He's only 6'1"",, med. build, and was hoping this robe would be long (I bought a bigger size thinking it would). It hits him him-calf. However, the robe is a great buy for the money."
2,Quality(plush?)of hooded terry bathrobe,"Very ordinary robe compared to picture and descripton. If plush means thick material this is not. It is low quality thin material with a warning to wash in cold.Any terry robe I have had before was thicker and better made--Sears, J.C. Penney.Does not llook durable."
4,terry robe,"The new owner of this bathrobe was vary happy. We both were hoping it would be thicker than it actually was, but still a great product."
2,disatisfied,not a good place to order from.the robe was huge and had a hard time getting refunded.wouldn't send anyone there.
5,AAAAA,"The photos don't tell the complete story. You can see how long it is, you can see how big the hood is. THE photos CAN'T tell you how thick/heavy and warm this bathrobe is. It could almost be used as a light coat."
3,Expensive for what you get,"It's a decent enough robe, but not worth the $$ it costs. As someone said, hooded robes are very hard to find, so I bought it. It arrived in a zippered plastic casing, which was good, but the robe itself smelled very strongly of formaldehyde (at least that's what my nursing experience suggested as the odor) I had to wash it rather vigorously, then dry it with 2 dryer sheets to get rid of that odor, but unlike what someone else here said, it did not, and has not fallen apart. I wish I'd looked around a bit more before buying it, but I don't think it's inferior in structure. It isn't very plush, though, so if softness and absorbency are issues for you, this isn't the product you should buy."
4,Good Quality,This robe is very good quality and is nice and long. It looks as it is in the picture. My husband was happy with it.
3,Robe needed repair after a few washings,I have had this robe for over 2 years. It has remained thick and soft. However some of the seams have come unraveled. So it is a good thing I have a sewing machine to reinforce them.
1,I'm misled.,"The quality of that bathrobe appeared to be far from what Amazon is advertising. And Amazon knows that, that's why the country of origin is not indicated at amazon site."
2,Not so great,"Well once it finally arrived I was very disappointed to find the seams in on the belt were falling off, and the material is very thin. Way overpriced, that's what I get for buying clothing on line."
3,watch your order close,"The Item got here super fast but it wasn't the robe I ordered. It had no hood on it and it says 1 size fits all but if you have long arms its not going to fit right. i'm a short man with short arms and the sleeves barely reach my wrists. It is a good heavy robe, the one I got, so I'm going to keep it anyway. I hate returning stuff I buy online because of the hassle of re packaging it and going to the post office and paying for shipping.I ""Think"" this is the item I actually received: http://www.amazon.com/Royal-Blue-Terry-Bathrobe-Cotton/dp/B000KD7AV4/ref=?ie=UTF8&m=A2GGN1N8USRG82"
1,wrong product shipped,i ordered hooded bathrobe and got non hooded bathrobe not worth the hassle to return because it was a gift for my wife for x-mas
1,Did not fit whipper,"This product does not fit my whipper, though it says it should. It is absolutely enormous for the screw it is meant to fit on. I will not buy from this company again"
5,SUPER!,"This book is what a GM (NPC) and PC's always has been dreaming about!!! Simply BRILLIANT! But there is missing something, like the lack of the different POOLS-describtions. There are some good desribtions on the different combat scenes and alot of other neat stuff. It's very handy!!!!!"
5,A must have for any GM,This book contains tons of useful information it tells you how to create shapeshifters and metahuman variants and the new character creation system helps make really good characters in a short peiod of time
3,(Sigh) yet another sourcebook...But desparately needed.,"As with any game, you need details. this book in my opinion is a vital part of the shadowrun universe. While one could incorporate ""Uncouth"" or ""College Education"" into a charicter background, this provides yet another way for starting chars to beef themselves up. The descriptions are funny, and the artwork is good. If you buy this book, get the Riggers 2.0 ...I just love the Gremlins Flaw."
2,ehhhhhh,"ever wondered just how to 'entice' your players to do away with roleplaying? here it is. inside this book, you too can learn how to no longer have a 'runner who pays moms bills' but, instead have a 'dependendant' as a 2 point flaw, which allows you to purchase the aptitude edge for your Light Machine Gun, 2 point edge. also included is a revision of the old 'sum to ten' character generation, a bunch of world of darkness ripoffs, and yet more alternate camapign ideas, for those of you who skipped 'missions'. While some of the sections on, 'personality' and 'friend of a friend' contacts seem custom made ofr shadowrun, the vast majority of the book feels like an excuse to allow for deadlier characters at generation with the illusion of personality tacked over them. I would have much rather seen information from the old OOP Shadowbeat revised and included in this book instead."
5,superb!,Everything you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask about the freaky Dutch filmmaker.
2,Be careful purchasing this item . . .,"Unfortunately I read the reviews and very excitely order the ""30 minute stamp workshop"" and while the style is definitely artsy, the proposed projects are very goofy. Sorry, I just don't know anyone that is going to wear the stamped barette I make them or use the cardboard stamped clock. I really was looking for a book showing ""non-cute"" greeting card, stationary and journal designs that I can whip out in 30 minutes or less thanks to step-by-step instructions. Yes, many of todays paper art magazine like Inspiration do show artwork and list supplies but I wanted more than that, like this book, but in stationary form."
4,"Great inspiration, new techniques, clever ideas.","I am a big fan of Sandra McCall because she thinks outside the box. Her ideas are original, often funky, fun and fresh.I bought this book, not to copy projects, but simply to learn some new techniques or get a new idea, then do my own designing. I never copy anyone else's design, I just soak up inspiration. In this regard, Sandra McCall never disappoints.I don't always look to see who the author is before I decide, and I own a very large library of this type of book. I have recently realized that several of my all time favorites were written by this author. If you want clever ideas and inspiration, you can't go wrong."
5,"If you don't like ""KOWLUNG TONG"", try this one!!!","This is a very exciting and very good written novel about the years before the coming 1997 in Hong Kong. Since Mr. S. Leather has been stayed in the Far East for over 18 years and mostly spent in Hong Kong. The description of the scenary and what's happening and what has happened before 1997 was a very deep and vividly portrayed. A very complicated and very absorbing, twisted story of adultery, betrayal, VietNam Syndrome and a robbery carried out by a Rolex accuracy and precision. Very interesting and fast paced novel. Highly recommended"
2,The Vets,"Just a churn em out thriller depending on word count and BS from other wantabe's writer's.Notice I never said how easy it is to write a book, much less a good read. But this is the fourth one that leaves a lot to be desired.Yeah, you make a lot of money, live the high life, but admit it, you could put a little effort into writeing a a good read.I know you can do it as the last book on Thailand proved you can do it if you try. Private Dancer was a good read, just give a LITTLE EFFORT PLEASE."
2,Good Not Great,"This biography of Dumas, though thorough, lacks a certain readability which is typical of many biographies written in the early 1900's (this book was first published in 1902). Spurr doesn't dwell too long on Dumas' plays as he does his novel writings which the reader may appreciate (given that most readers won't be familiar with his stage works). I would recommend in place of this biography, ""Alexandre Dumas,: A biography and study"" by A. Craig Bell. The descriptive power of Bell makes the book read very quickly and his understanding of Dumas is unparalleled. I believe Bell (whose biography was published in 1950) was influenced by Spurr's however, in the fact that there are many similar quotes and stories which are identical. I found that Bell was able to make Dumas come alive in his descriptions of his life and works instead of Spurr, who seemed more caught up with dates and facts."
4,Fast and Good,"I received the DVD I ordered in record time, and it was in mint condition. I love the ""Vicar"" series and was happy that the quality was excellent. I am happy, happy, happy, that I browsed Amazon."
1,Not a funny main character,"The ensemble cast makes me laugh, and the jokes at the end. Love British comedies, but this tanks."
4,STILL ENJOYABLE,"British humor at its ambivalent second-best. The cast is impeccable, the events typical, and ambitions kept in rigid check. I hope there is Season Three although the British way of numbering may, once again, prove too confusing."
5,Crazy About the Vicar!,"I'm not sure who is the real genius, Dawn French or the writers of Vicar. I'm guessing it is almost everyone who was involved with this production. These are episodes I can watch over and over, they are that good. The Vicar of Dibley can be raunchy and then spiritual, and it all works. I do wish the cast would get together for another special, so that someday I could purchase that dvd as well."
3,Great show but poor sound quality,"I absolutely love this series and it is hilarious. However, the DVD recording quality could be better. It seems that the laughter (piped in or real) is louder than when the characters are speaking. I have to constantly lower and raise the sound. I don't think it's my machine since I don't have to do this for other DVDs"
4,Great TV series,"A very entertaining TV series, a bit on the spicy side (verbally not pictorally), definitely British humor."
4,Not for Those Who Tend to Get Offended,"OK, I'm hooked on ""Dibley"" and got this particular set because the no. 2 disc in my set of the first three Dibley's broke.I think it is a series worth watching if you are youngish-at-heart, and Christ-oriented or at least don't mind the somewhat-fantasied version of the church scene; otherwise, I'm not sure the acting is worth sitting through (the writing went a bit overboard with some of the characters to the immaturish, and the amateurish). Some of the story tangents are too rude for the conservative, but if you sit back and ignore these directing mistakes and enjoy the goodness in the stories and the characters, it makes a wonderful series to watch, over and over again."
5,This book is outstanding!,This book is really a good one. The recipes are all easy to follow and the photos are all done very well. Prima Publishing did an outstanding job on this one.
5,Regina's the BEST!,"After trying Regina's Herbed Ravioli Soup for the first time, I was floored at how good vegetarian could be. If this was vegetarian, I could easily convert. Well, I didn't convert, but I still grab Regina's book off the shelf from time to time, and I've never once been disappointed by a single recipe. Even my father, a devout carnivore, afraid to try new things, has always been pleased with Regina's fare. I can't wait for her second book to arrive! In the meantime, I highly recommend this book to anyone! You WON'T be disappointed!"
5,Answer to the REVELATOR question,"I remember the person from New Zealand thought that Blind John Davis sang a song with the word Revelator in the title. Well, it turns out that it was Blind Willie Johnson who sang a song called John The Revelator. Look on Ebay in the Blues section. Good Luck."
1,Poor writing style,"The book was okay. I was very disappointed in the writing. Although the author had pretty good tips on water gardens, the redundancy of the word ""low-maintenance"" made it almost unbearable to read.I had purchased the book because I was interested in low-maintenance water gardens but I did not need to be reminded of it on every page."
3,Lite Brite Refills,"Value for number of refill sheets. However, note that these come rolled up and you need to flatten them. I reversed the roll and secured it with rubber bands for a day or two and they were OK."
3,Small Pages,These are the small sheets and if you are using the older version of Lite Brite they don't even come close to filling the screen. I wish they still made the larger refills!
2,Lite Brite All-Paper Refill Set,"I was looking for the 8 X 10 papers (didn't know there was a small version of Lite Brite) and my granddaughter doesn't want to even try the little papers. Having knowledge of the size papers would have been a great help. As it is, I wasted $15. As far as the product goes, for what it is, it is fine."
1,lameness incarnate,"this storyline sucks. theres no buildup, no rising action, it basically starts off at the climax and plateaus, and ends too abruptly. thankfully the story was retconned out of continutiy very soon after it was released, and the 'damage' that happened to NYC was never mentioned by the other books of the marvel u; EVER.this is the epitome of the reason people have started to stop reading the x books, characters that you hate, and hate that you hate them, and writers that need to be put on riddilin (did i spell that right?)avoid this book at all cost.and btw:[spoiler alert!}XORN IS MAGNETO!!!!! (not really, he's just xorn in disguise, he's dressed up as magneto, who's pretending to be xorn, who's still xorn underneath it all! weird huh?)"
1,DHI only affirms their pioneer status with this record,DHI's follow up only affirms their status atop the electro industrial bands from Canada. Again the band show's its diverse style by cover the entire genre in sound.
4,Made for Films,"Whether for theatrical release or as a ""made for television"" film, Clark's books are the stuff of which enticing, though forgettable, movies are made. That is not intended as a knock, rather it points up the fact that the stress is on the suspenseful moment, the situation of danger, and the last minute save. Acting, set design, scene construction, depth of character. are of secondary importance. The result is that, despite seeing how it is being done, practically sitting in on the writer and directors meetings, we are still carried along by the desire to find out how it will finally resolve itself.Manifesting your willpower by showing only one of these a week, as in any TV mystery series, will increase your pleasure and avoid the danger of being too conscious of the common plot devices."
4,Subtitles/Captions,"Great show, love it. I taped it on VHS. I'm so glad it's on DVD now. Only problem : there are no subtitles or captions for the hearing impaired (or non native english speakers) for whom they're a great help and sometimes the (fake ?) laughs cover the pun or punch line. I hope the next installments will provide this sometimes much needed feature."
5,Spin City Season Sets-Finally!!!,"This show is an absolute gem,I can't believe it has taken this long to get a release. Michael J. Fox is fantastic and the chemistry between the entire ensemble was just hilarious and made for such engaging viewing.I am so glad the 1st season is coming to dvd so I can be amused by City Halls' hijinx time and time again. I do hope all four seasons are released and quickly.Thank you Spin City cast for classic comedy that delivers everytime I watch."
1,Very Disappointed,"Reading the other reviews, this seemed worth buying. My own experience is it wasn't funny, and I found it to be very trite, with not much substance to the show. Althought the acting was fine, it was more the dialogue and writing that were poor for me.I didn't bother watching all of Season 1 as it seemed a waste of my time."
5,Wonderful Xmas gift!,This was a great xmas gift for a a friend who loves comedy. I will be purchasing the rest of the season.
1,What a disappointment. . .,"I have been enjoying Messiah's earlier album, ""21st Century Jesus,"" for several years now -- each time techno/electronica splinters off into yet another sub-genre, I always come back to Messiah, and it is a relief (yes, it's old school techno, but it's so much stronger musically than much of the electronica coming out these days). I was ecstatic when I discovered that Messiah had a second album -- unfortunately that feeling was obliterated when I actually listened to it. Sub-standard in every way. Trying to like Progenitor was an exercise in futility. Don't judge Messiah by this album."
2,This is Messiah!?,"I bought 21st Century Jesus looking for a band or an album that was as good as Prodigy's Experience (or Music for the Jilted Generation), and what I got blew me away. Not only was it just as good, but it was a style completely different. The pulsing rhythms, polyphonic synths, it was great.Needless to say, my anticipation and expectations when purchasing this album were pretty high. And it's not that it didn't live up to expectations. It's that this album was SO bad, that not only did I not think it even was Messiah (Messiah presents??? - was this somehow a different band???), but I returned it to the store where I had bought it from citing that ""it didn't sound right.""And you know, if you are a Messiah fan, this album definitely does not sound right."
3,No illustrations?,I'm disappointed that illustrations included in the original text are not provided in the kindle edition.Kind of like reading a Reader's Digest condensed version.
3,Good for a hybrid or wood cover!,I bought this for my girlfriend pretty quick shipping amd good quality but it doesn't fit her driver which it said it would bit it fits her 3 wood great!
3,"Fairly good, but not the best one...","If you are looking for an introductory book on game theory maybe this is not the best pick. Even though the mathematical approach is really easy, other books, which have been published later, are much easier to grasp the sometimes complicated concepts...I deeply suggest readers to buy either Gardner or Bierman, Fernandez before spending their money on this book."
4,Nice,"While the book falters in places in its explanations of equilibrium concepts, over all it is a coherent, readable and manageable book. Much better than the other tomes that students of game theory such as myself have to trawl through to find information."
3,A concise primer for undergrads,"This is a nice book on game theory if you're not very mathematically inclined. It was recommended as a supplementary text for a graduate-level course that I took, and I enjoyed it as such. But for a more thorough introductory text for undergrads, I strongly recommend Osborne'sAn Introduction to Game Theory. This one is preferable only if you're allergic to rudimentary set theory."
3,Game Theory for Applies Economists Review,"Was the course book in a strong game theory class. It's a graduate class at the ISyE deparment at Georgia Tech. But, I didn't like the book that much; cause it's a little bit boring, beside it's got too little pages (round 200 only), and so, I doubt that it's the best game theory reference. However, I think it's a good start, especially for anyone who is trying to learn game theory on his/her own."
5,A rare find,"This book was so inspiring to me that I named my first born after the author 'Yatri'.Yatri (the author's book name) is an Englishman that had spend many years in the highlands of India. He wasn't an anthropologist of anything like that, but he had a vision, or insight, to stop doing what he did and to go to India. It changed his life and the book, the only one he published as far as I know, is a rare treasure.For it's time the book is beautifully composition and well written. Every sentence is absorbing. It was almost written like Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet, from whom by the was I took the name for of my second born Kahlil.It is a serious book on spirituality. It is however spiced with lots of high impact predictions of the future of mankind. It is also humorous. The illustrations and photography is outstanding.The name 'Yatri' comes from Hindi and means 'traveller'.If I had to leave all my books behind bar one, this is the one."
5,"Unknown man helps man be k""now""ing","This book I first bought when it came out in 1988 and since then I have referanced it lovingly. It is written both scientifically and mystically and appeals to my mind. It is a classic text that will guide the reader through the history of mans undenialable shame and violence towards virtually everything. The author then guides through the potential way out of this situation by turning towards the guidance of higher spirituality of yoga, Hinduism, Sufism, kabbalah. He describes the coming of a new species of human that really knows what it takes to live on this sacred planet with the other human becomings/beings. There is alight at the end of the tunnel yet it takes honesty ,courage , a brain and a heart to get to that light. This is a great book and I thank the author for creating such a masterful piece of work. Om and amen."
5,More surprises,"When I ordered this one from Amazon, I didn't know Don Cherry was on it with Willie. What a pleasant surprise! They make nice sounds together. Don't suppose Don Cherry's ""Band of Gold"" would fit Willie's style too much, though. Too much to hope for."
5,Love this book,"I love this book. My most recent purchase was for a few more copies to give away to business associates. The theme is doing things to make yourself special, and what a lesson it is for junior staff who are stuggling just to finish the day. It helps me inspire them to do just a bit more to accomplish just a tad more, and to become a little more special and unique. This was one of the last books Tom wrote before he went all goofy on the fonts and produced books that were unreadable. This one is from his golden years."
1,Author does a very poor job of reading the book.,First let me say I have not read the paperback edition of the book. Mr. Peter's reading of the book is poor at best. His speech pattern is very annoying and makes it difficult to concentrate on the content. I would not recommend the audio version of this publication.
1,disappointing,"One only has to read a few pages of this book before the realization of making a purchasing mistake hits hard. A catchy title with nothing inside. Sort of reminds me of Bill Clinton, maybe handsome (exterior) but no character (interior).Save your money and invest it instead in the Peter Drucker classics and on some of John Maxwell's great reads like Failing Forward.Tom Peters work, In search of excellence, was tremendous this book fails to inspire. Avoid it."
1,SAVE THE ONE CENT YOU CAN BUY IT FOR ON AMAZON USED,Save your time and the one cent and readCompetitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performanceand prepare for the 21st Century global economy with solid sanity.
2,"Tom Peters is enthralled with his own ""zaniness.""","Here's Tom Peters' advice: hire ""zany"" people who don't know how to dress professionally (because they have a lot of energy); throw out every idea, concept, and system that has ever WORKED for your firm (because you don't want to grow stale); and forget any and all conventional measures of success (because they're wrong, and Tom Peters is right). We are not in business to make money or even to provide a great product/service --we're in business to be different at all costs (proof: Peters pooh-pooh's McDonald's as ""McOrdinary's""). Although some of his ideas might prove useful to some readers, I found myself increasingly annoyed with Peters' own infatuation with himself (""aren't I crazy? aren't I just rocking your world?""). His tone conveys the sense that he'll say anything to be shocking--hardly a good motivation for writing a business book."
1,Read the reviews carefully and think!,"It is invalid to use the 5th edition to attempt to debunk claims of the 6th edition. The 6th edition, clearly states that 1+2=3 is false. The fact that the 5th edition gets it right is exactly what is wrong with these books. It is riddled with errors and while some errors get fixed, more get created! Is this a sign of a quality book? Not on planet earth.This book flat-out sucks. There are plenty of books on this subject, that are superior. If you can't find any, you haven't looked at all.I got an A in the class that used this book, but not because of this book. This book put that A in serious jeopardy, all it did was confuse me about topics that I had previously understood from class. My notes and the teachers handouts were far better, perhaps I should publish them and charge $110 for it."
5,excellent - especially for future math teachers,"The heart of the book is exercises in grading proofs. These are very useful - especially to future teachers.There is a lot of overlap between the first four chapters of this book and what is often taught in discrete math but the book is more thorough and rigorous. In addition, there is a chapter on cardinality, and introductions to abstract algebra and real analysis.Teachers may not get a chance to take many upper level undergraduate courses that are oriented to math majors. This book is a transition to math for mathematicians (rather than engineers and science students) and covers the fundamentals in a very accessible manner."
4,Very nice text,"This book clearly does NOT suppose ""number theory""---unless you mean that a even number plus an even number is even!The point of this book is to help students make the transition from plug and chug calculus, linear algebra, etc, to thinking through WHY theorems are true, and how to go about proving them. No, the material is not advanced. The focus is on the language and techniques of proofs. Who wants to struggle proving the fundamental theorem of algebra without even knowing what induction is?I've taught with this text for several years now and find it presentation and coverage, as do the students. Yes, the cost is outrageous...as are most textbooks. Buy it used."
2,Transition to Advanced Mathematics,"This is an older edition and when I purchased it there was no mention of it being an ""International Student Edition"" which I am not! The reading is the same but the problems are different so I have to always match them up with what's assigned for homework."
4,Not a Bad Textbook,"We've been using this in our Introduction to Mathematical Proofs class (an upper-level undergraduate math class). I was a little nervous after seeing so many bad reviews here, but it's been a fine textbook. It's easy to learn the material from the book, and the question/problem sets are useful too. I don't have any other books of this type to compare it to, of course, but the layout of the text and material is clear, with definitions and properties given as needed."
1,Does not even worth reading,"With all due respects to all the Math books I've learned in the past 21 years, this book is one of the least benefitial book ever written.1) The theorem is poorly proofed and illustrated. Don't even bother talking about explaining here because there's only statements instead of explanation.2) Exercises are so hard, there are problems you don't even understand the questions. Plus this book is so ridiculous, it doesn't give the answer to all the odd problems. Some chapter, there are like 2, 3 answers to the 20 problems they give out.After all we're all mathematician reading this book to understand or learn about the theorem in the book. But if there is not anything to explain why the theorem is what it is, then I question myself, WHY YOU EVEN BOTHER OWN THIS BOOK if it doesn't help you learn at all????????DO NOT BUY IT, it's a waste of money!"
2,Are You Kidding Me?!?!?! {Dr.Phil Voice},"We used this book for our ""Bridge to Abstract Mathematics"" class. This book falls short of what you would consider a book to be called a TEXTbook. A comprehensive study guide with this book would probably make all the difference. The exercises at the end of each section were so far fetched, that I resorted to the Teacher's Solution Manual to see how the first couple of problems were done. It's great that the book shows some basic proofs throughout the individual sections, but it does not show applications of the theorems and such like the end of the section problems.If this is your ""text"" for your class, I would highly suggest going to the library and serch for introductory TEXT(s) on set theory and proofing to gt a good grade."
4,Used,"I bought this textbook as a ""used"" copy. I believe in the statement ""You get what you pay for"" so I really can't complain too much. The book might have been a little more worn out than I would have liked, but it's fine. Textbooks are overpriced these days, anyways."
1,Not worth the Price and probably your time!,"I purchased this book and its about 400 pages or so and is rather unfortunate. A lot of the examples in the book leave you hanging and confused to how the author arrived at the result. The book is obviously not worth the price. My professor is one of the authors of this book so its all clear why you shouldn't get this one, which he was even worse. Explore you options before falling into this mind trap. It may present all of the basic ideas of mathematics: proofs, set theory, relations, functions, cardinality, and other, but it doesn't explore them."
1,One LAZY textbook,"With all due respect to the textbooks authors, this has to be one of the laziest written textooks I've ever used! I cannot believe that for some of the theorem's they give, they say ""the proof of this theorem is excercise 12"" and they they don't even give the answer to that problem...talk about lazy! Which brings up another problem, this text gives answers to only about 1/5 of the problems. Its the only mathetmatics textbook I've ever used that doesn't give answers to ALL of the odd problems.The examples and answers they do give are simply not very helpful. The explanations are quite poor. How any teacher could praise this book is beyond me. Its like the authors are trying to play a joke on the students who really want to learn these proofs. If your teacher assigns this book I highly suggest finding another book as a supplement."
4,more substantive than most books of this type,"This book has what I want in terms of content, a treatment of the basic language of mathematicasl proof, i.e. logic, sets and functions, and then three chapters actually using that language to do significant proofs.Those chapters treat cardinality of sets both finite and infinite, basic algebra of groups including LaGrange's theorem, and then elementary analysis such as convergence theorems using completeness of real numbers.Unfortunately this seems to make it too hard for weak students, and there are a lot of those out there, as evidenced by some of these reviews. I.e. this book is written seriously, and in a bit of a dry style, as books were in the 60's."
1,GARBAGE AND JUNK,"This is one of the worst of the worst books i have ever come across in my math undergrad studies. All the people praising this book are either phd students, professors, those having something to do with the publisher or the ones who're talking about 5th or earlier editions. Like one user praises about this book here as, ""we used this book in 1984 and i fell in love with it"". this book was never there before 2005. Regarding why it is so poor --- any math student taking this course first time will struggle tremendously. i have gotten grades like B+ and B's in 400 level math courses, but this is a 290 level course and i had to take this course 3 times before getting a C+. to get through, i had to buy other books on this same subject at amazon like, ""learning to reason, an introduction to logic, sets and relations by nancy rodgers"" which i found awesome. and not to mention the price -- pure ripoff. such kind of book shouldn't be worth more than a roll of toilet paper!"
1,This book is GARBAGE... not worth the time.,"All the examples are difficult to follow, most of the important proves are left for excercises and many of the topics are not fully covered. It is hard to read for a student and this book is one of the worst mathmatic books that I have read."
2,Different strokes for different folks,"After reading reviews here I went out and bought this track light. It's aesthetically pleasing - no doubt, but at 60w per bulb, it doesn't give off very much light. The lamp itself is pretty heavy, which makes for a stable base, but it's not ideal to move around with. I move back and forth from my home to my dorm and it's become such a hassle I leave it in my friend's shed during the summer.If you're looking for something pretty with soft light, this is the lamp for you. If you're looking for a work light, this model just won't cut it."
4,"Great value, simplistic design....","Great price, simple clean design, only problem: eats up bulbs like candy!"
4,I Still Like It!,"I've had this lamp for over a year and have had no problems. It's a great accent to the other furniture in the room and provides the opportunity to direct the light in several directions instead of having all the light going up or down as with most lamps. In reference to the outlet problems pointed out by the other two reviewers, mine is plugged into the outlet where the powerstrip for my computer and all its accessories are plugged in. I haven't run into a problem with the circuits yet. I do agree that the shades get very hot, but that's pretty much a given if you buy a lamp with metal shades on it (duh). As for the children, it's also a given to not put things on the floor that a child could knock over. All floor lamps are top heavy and will fall if a baby trys to use it to stand."
4,"Inexpensive, pretty well made","The lamp actually doesnt seem to overheat as much as similar floor lamps that I have owned, and is overall pretty sturdy. It seems like it will last a decent amount of time, especially for the price paid."
1,Worked for 1 week and then blew out the circuit breaker,"I bought this lamp and it worked great for 1 week. Then something tripped our circuit breaker. We finally found out it was this lamp. Anywhere we plugged it in, it tripped the breaker. I wouldn't suggest buying this lamp."
2,Durability Problem,This lamp has a nice look to it but my one year old was able to break it in half. It will no longer screw back together. It's nice looking but it can be knocked over easily. It also gets very hot to the touch. So if you have children or don't like fire hazzards I wouldn't bother.
4,Very convenient but they bite a little!,"These shoes are comfortable and easy to slip on/off but they never fail to give me two shoe-bites each unless I wear them with socks. With socks, they're great."
1,Tasteless,"I received this produce pretty fast, the packaging is really cute but the tea is tasteless. It is a mint tea but I cannot taste the mint at all. Disappointed, will not order again."
2,I returned this...very disappointing!,I returned this since it did not play on my TV's DVD player; but it did play on my Mac.While I have a huge respect for the reenactors in this video I found the chatter from the observers very distracting and even disrespectful. This film was not at all what I expected.
2,quality teaching; incompetent design,"The design of this product ruins it, and renders it useless unless you have either a lot of patience for poor design or a willingness to shuffle between formats and chapters in the course of a single 'session.'On the first day, we start with CD2, track 4. then we move to DVD1, where we move between 4 non-sequential chapters. So you do an exercise, then have to get your remote out? Please. Day 1 should be ""play DVD1,"" without stopping. It's not that hard. The publishers should be ashamed of themselves."
3,Essential Qigong Course Review,"The CD's were excellent. Ken Cohen is knowledgeable and his presentation is very organized.The DVD's were disappointing. The DVD's were published previously under a different title. I already had the DVD's. While the DVD training was good, I wish I had known that they had been previously published --- so that I would not have been expecting new material."
3,Good introductory course and reference. Poor execution.,"Don't get me wrong. If you follow this from the beginning, it will teach you much about traditional Chinese qigong exercise. It is however, often sophomoric in its implementation of Taoist principles and often modifies basic techniques to be more palatable to both the instructor and the uneducated apprentice. Ken has a basic understanding of qigong but lacks depth and clarity in its function. If this system was true to it's Taoist principles, it would cost much less.This is a good reference guide for someone starting out who maybe does not have the time to train under the guidance of someone who really knows what they are doing. It is a framework at best, but an effective one which will reward the diligent practitioner with increased health - but there are more comprehensive qigong systems out there for less money; even free if you use the internet."
1,Practice what you preach.,"What can a fat-bellied, gray thinning hair, pudgy faced, glasses wearing white guy with under eye bags and man boobs tell you about Qigong, Health, and Healing?Apparently a lot... and this for me is the problem with Ken Cohen and this course. Ken doesn't look healthy or fit, and has about as much flexibility as a pug, if that.I'm just glad I found a torrent of this instead of purchasing it. I only wasted my time downloading and watching it until it happily ended up in my window's trash bin."
1,I do not reccomend this recording,"I am a fanatical Cuban music fan. There is no Cuban group which I hold in higher regard than Aragon. They are, in many ways, the quintessential Cuban performers. This recording, which contains no information about when or where it was made, does the group an injustice. The quality of the recording is poor. Sometimes one can not hear the rhythm section at all. Frankly, I wonder if this disc was made by copying an old LP or radio broadcast. If you want to acquaint yourself with the classic Aragon recordings, buy ""Cuban Originals"" on BMG or the ""Heart of Havana"" discs. However, I encourage you to check Aragon's current offerings, ""La Charanga Eterna"" (chevere) or ""Quien Sabe Sabe""."
3,Mediocre at best,"The best thing about this Hammer documentary are the interview clips of Yutte Stensgaard, an actress who has mostly avoided her Hammer connection. It is great to see her here in what may be her only filmed interview on the subject. There are some other interesting interviews as well but, unfortunately, on several of them the sound is nearly inaudible. Some of the facts put forth by the narrator needed checking. One example, James Bernard never conducted his own compositions. He was not a conductor and said so many times. Also, the harsh words about Twins of Evil and Hands of the Ripper are puzzling. There is little critical commentary throughout so it is all the odder when the narrator suddenly begins finding fault with these films, which are generally quite well thought of."
2,Rough! For die hard fans.,"Ever been to a Horror Convention? If you haven't then pass on this one. If you have, then you have been in a question and answer session where the sound was so bad you couldn't understand a thing. Well, now you know what to expect. No sound remastering to make it understandable either. I must admit seeing Christopher Lee do Sylvester the Cat from Bugs Bunny was pretty funny. This is only for the die hards."
2,Momentum Carbon FIber Titanium Watch,The wrist band on this man's watch is smaller than child's watch band. Aweful experience since it is 12/22 and this was supposed to be a gift for my husband.
2,Average at best,"The shots described in the book are somewhat interesting, but the guidance on the mental game is completely off base with no foundation. There are only a handful of Pro's in this game and I doubt any of them would benefit from this book. If the book is aimed at the non Pro, then there are much better options out there for improving your game (Capelle's practicing pool for example)."
3,Grouper Moon Book Review,"Grouper Moon, by Cynthia Shaw, is an exciting book that addresses real problems that exist today. Renny, a twelve-year-old boy, is the main character along with J.D., Cooper the Grouper, and others. Renny lives on an island in the Caribbean. On this island Renny has a reef that he and most of the people know as Renny's reef. When Renny gets a pair of fins for Christmas he is able to explore the reef more thoroughly than ever before.On Renny's first swim on the reef with his new fins he is out to catch a Nassau grouper. While Renny was searching he came upon a grouper who led him to a cove in which he didn't have to breath. In this cove is where Renny meets the grouper named Cooper.I thought Grouper Moon was a book in which the fish characters were some of the best that I have seen. On the other hand the humans were poorly developed. I recommend this book to anyone who is concerned of over fishing of endangered fish."
5,Super Cool,"I have a major problem with this tool , every timeI lay it down on the job one of my co-workers walksoff with it. May have to hire a guard .I have swung numerous other hammers includingtitanium . Vaughan is hands down the best.."
3,Good Book,Nice book in general. Lots of details about the establishment of FR and activities in Vietnam. Reccomended for people realy interested in FR history.
5,The most complete series on labor history.,"This is the first volume of Philip Foner's massive history of the Labor movement in the United States. In my opinion it is the best and most complete work of its kind in existence. Fonor did an extrordinary job of researching the original documents from the earliest era of American Labor and succedes in providing an emense amount of factual information while still telling a good story. If you want a detailed study of American Labor this is the only place to go. If you have a more casual interest I would recommend Labor's Untold Story by Richard Boyer, Herbert Morais."
1,Acetyl-L-Carnitine,The price was way to high for what I ordered. It should have been a count of 240: Only received a count of 120. Not a good price for what it should have been.
2,Doesn't seem to work fo me,"I have Chemically Induced Peripheral Neuropathy from Chemotherapy and have lost much of the feeling in my fingers and feet. After searching MANY articles, these to supplements seemed to have the best reputation, but for me they seem to have done nothing. I still have another 30 tablets to try so I'll finish the bottle, and if there is any improvement I'll modify this review. I wrote this review now because Amazon had asked me to rate it, otherwise I probably would have waited 2 months until all the tablets were used."
1,Strong vinegar smell,Purchased this product in early 2008 and again in early 2009. The last bottle had a faint odor of acetic acid (vinegar) when opened; and over the course of a couple months the smell intensified. I ended up throwing it out. Perhaps source naturals needs better inventory control or production quality control.
1,Irrational Therapy - Do NOT buy this product!,ALA & AC should not be combined - shame on Source Naturals for playing this up...ALA needs to be taken with food - preferably a large meal w/ lots of protien & fats...while AC should be taken on an empty stomach for ideal absorption...stay away from this one!
1,Had a bad reaction,"Hi - let me start by saying I'd researched this supplement combo before buying and trying. But obviously, I had a reaction: after taking just one tab, I developed a headache, stiff neck, and my BP shot up to 180/120. I also feel quite shakey. Seems like I had an allergic reaction...or some kind of reaction.No bad feedback about the product - I'm extremely sensitive to supplements and drugs anyways. I recommend you try this, one tab at a time and watch for a reaction. I'm glad that others are doing so well with it. I'm envious. Looks like it just doesn't work for me. And, that's OK."
2,Causes Constipation; no noticeable changes in energy levels,"When I first read the research results about taking the combination of L-Carnitine and Alpha Lipoic Acid together, I was really excited about getting these tablets. I even set myself up for a monthly order of them and gave bottles of them to my sisters & parents. Unfortunately, everyone who took them complained of them causing constipation, so no one would take any more of them. The tablets didn't seem to affect me until about a year ago (2011) - the packaging changed slightly about that time. Either the ingredients changed or I did, and now they cause constipation in me, too. I've cancelled my recurring orders because of this, and am just using my existing stock whenever I eat beans, chili or cabbage.I never noticed a difference in my energy levels because of these tablets, and that was the primary reason I ordered them to begin with. But of course it's hard to do a controlled experiment with just one person..."
2,Pretentious and outdated,"Many interesting data and connection between them, many thoughts to wonder about BUT the style and typography of the book almost discredits its content. I'd never have thought that a pretentious, claptrap oral presentation style can be transplanted into a book. What a pity!Well, it's a quick read, contains some noteworthy ideas, but now some data are outdated and most forecasts proved to be wrong."
5,Unique Perspective on the Changing World,"""As the Future Catches You"" is an interesting and unique treatise on the forces driving change in today's world. The book is written in a unique style, incorporating copious graphics and charts along with varying font faces and sizes.For those interested in learning about change...and the drivers of change from Juan Enriquez's perspective...this is a good read.Highly recommended."
3,outdated,The subject is very dynamic and the news become obsolete very quickly in this field. An updated version would be nice.
4,excelent,This book can really open your eyes to technology and help you understand how fast the world is turning.Also is a book very easy to read.
5,Daughters of Eve Strength for Today from Women of Yesterday,"It is relevant to today Excellent we use it for our ladies Bible Study, well written and easy to understand."
5,daughters of eve,"we started a womens group study and just being together on wenesday morning at one of the lady's houses in the church. i read the reviews, read a little of the insert, and thought before purchasing this book. we've got about 4-5 more women to go through and i LOVE IT!! i highly recommend this book. we read a chapter a week and talk about it. i think it has all helped us be open with one another and brought us closer together. i have learned somthing every week! it has a different women you are studying in each chapter, sometimes 2, and you learn about thier life, what happened, and what you can learn from it in todays world. it also ties in other things that pertain to whom you are learning about. i am now looking up other books she writes to start when we get done with this one. again HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book. so glad i bought everyone a copy to keep. this would be a good gift for even devotional time by yourself."
3,Deep House Gems? Yes and No...,"This deejay did a good job, giving each track it's respectable play, and the tracks are almost guaranteed to light up any dancefloor or bedroom... but as the other reviewer suggested, there is hardly anything that sets it apart from all the other mixed cd's out there. It sounds like something OM, Wave, Nervous or Chez music would've released, which is a good thing and not so good at the same time...My favorite track is:#2- Sunshine- Anthony Nicholson feat. Charlotte Huntwhy? because it hasn't been played to death ;-)and of course it's really nice too!"
3,An average ride through the current trends....,"Yes, we've heard these same tracks time and again on almost every other ""deep, jazzy, sexy..."" house compilation. So what makes this mixed cd any different? Really, nothing. The same ole' blending one track into the next and basic beat keeping is all you'll get out of this release (yawn...). The tracks are nice, and I did enjoy them the first 100 times on all those other mixed cd's out there, so let's try to dig deeper into those crates...This is trying to be like the stuff out on OM records, and I'm getting pretty tired of them too. Sorry Florida, deep house and sunny weather just don't click, leave the deep house to New York and Chicago, the colder the cooler..."
1,119.00 is a little much for a dvd,"when i put this video in my wish list it was 12.00 dollars.lol maybe someone has made a mistake,so i guess you should keep ie"
5,Excellent digitally remastered version of th Zaparuder film.,A lot of work went into converting the film frame by frame and then enhancing each frame using state of the art computer software.A good part of the DVD shows how this was done.There is also a (wide screen version) of this film that has never been seen before.It uses that part of the film that has holes on both sides(normally where a movie projector catches the film to foward or reverse).The holes show up during playback but there is no way around this.The DVD format works great here because you can jump back and forth or frame by frame without having to rewind.Video tape would be a pain trying to show this off. Each frame of the 26sec video is numbered for analysis.It is also very graphic...You can literally see the presidents forehead dissapear.Be warned...This extreme footage has been blown up and enhanced to bring out as much detail as possible using todays modern techniques.
2,Zapruder Film,"It was 90 minutes of looking at the same thing regular speed, slow motion, edited regular speed, edited slow motion, good quality regular speed, good quality slow motion, etc......."
5,History as you may never see again,"Eyewitnesses are given too much credibility and are notoriously inaccurate. Conspiracy buffs have fashioned an industry out of events told and retold but this footage is the best witness. It is also horrific to watch. I had heard the Parkland surgeons all talk about a head wound behind the President's right ear. They should know, they were there right? The film shows otherwise. If there is a conspiracy it is a well kept secret, show me someone who can keep a secret. If the US government is hiding evidence why is this footage available? No one can tell where a shot came from by the target's movement. The answer to where JFK's missing brain is here, the third shot pulverized it, turning it into a red mist. Had this film never existed the conspiracy people would have made millions more but the answers to their questions are in this footage. This is history which cannot be retold by bad historians or knuckleheads. See for yourself."
1,BAD NEWS: 6 FRAMES ARE MISSING,"I have some really bad news for you all.Frames 155, 156, 208, 209, 210, 211 are missing!But we have 483 frames out of 486.....This means not only 6 frames are missing but 3 OTHERS have been added!You need to buy this VHS video so you can have a reference point for the brain-washing that is to take place. These frames that are conveniently omitted (go buy the tape and see) are also the very frames where time/space compression was used to make it look like the Presidential limousine was moving when it was really stopped; implications being guess who was behind the assassination?Web Research bystanders Rosemary Willis and Croft who because of these and other cuts do some strange things on the sidewalk.Buyer BEWARE!"
4,HAS THIS FILM BEEN TAMPERED WITH?,"IMAGE OF AN ASSASSINATION - A NEW LOOK AT THE ZAPRUDER FILM (MPI,) is an alleged film record of Kennedy's murder. Alleged because this infamous home movie has been examined by optical experts and seems filled with puzzling anomalies that can't be reproduced using identical film, optics and allignments in Dealey Plaza and the infamous Grassy Knoll (see James Fetzer's book ""Assassination Science""). The images of Kennedy's head exploding are still jolting. Four different views are included as is historical material surrounding the film. Whether tampered with or not, this film is a piece of history that defines the moment when America's social, political and psychological paradigm shifted."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in how the author kept blaming the white man and/or the system for ""setting up"" young black men over and over again. Of course this book is written by an inmate who I am sure was ""set up"". This book was just not good at all."
4,very good,"This book was actually enjoyable. It held my interest and the story line made sense. some of the things that happened I figured out before they wer revealed, but I still enjoyed the story."
3,Immaminx,"I've read several of the ""gutter"" or ""Ghetto"" styling ala Noire, which is one of my favorite authors of that genre, but Leo seems to be an author coming into their own in this field. The book is nicely written, could do with come coherent plotting to keep it tight and together but all and all not bad. I hate when I come across these reviews and people have all but told the entire book, so I won't do that. What I will say is, if your bored and you've gotten the book from the library, read it. Unless you're feeling adventurous and just want to support a newer author buy it. Other than that, if you read ANY book of this type, you've read this one. It's kinda anti-climatic. Not bad, but not great."
3,It was an o.k. read!,The book was an o.k. read but it was a bit extra! The story was exciting but a times seemed a little over the top.
4,Thank God 4 Hope!!....,"Let me start off by saying I was intimidated by the length of this book. No where did I think I was going to finish it in a couple of hours but I did. It drew me in from the first chapter, and I had continue on. Though there were some parts in the chapter that I kinda of skimmed though wish I wish I didnt after reading this book ""Life"" it gave me a whole new perspective on my life and the people I deal with and their life style. It made me want to go out and change my current major from pre-med to criminology just so I could help our fellow black men/women in prison. It made my blood boil to think this is how the system really works and how some people just could care less about hiding their discrimination against blacks because they had the upper authority. But ""Life"" has its way of evening things out in the end. This was a great book and is well worth the read. GO AHEAD N PICK IT UP!!!"
5,LiFe,"This book was Greeat! A sexxy, hot steamy, and erotic urban tale. The ending wasn't a HOllywood ending, but I truly enjoyed!"
1,very disappointed.,this books i bought because i thought it was going to be good but disappointed me
1,dissapointed,"i could not really enjoy this book and i have to say that i absolutey hated the ending, with who life cose to marry, but it seemd like the author just had too many thoughts and they all got mixed up and it came out a complete mess, srry but i wouldnt recomend this book"
1,"""Dont let the title fool you""","Okay when i read the back of the book at a book store i was like yeah this is gonna be off the hook! but when i got it home and started reading it, it was slow then it skiped to Black and his crew which was boring to me. i mean it skipped years then went back to him and hope when he was on trial. they only shared one night together and that was it! man this was wack and i felt that i wasted my money it was to me ""Fake"" he makes you think they were together for a while then they broke up and she was the working with the state and even though she had his child that he didnt know about she was still gonna send him away! ""Yeah right"" she was his lawyer. then witht he aids thing that through me off matter factt he whole book through me off....if i was you i would not read it buy it or matter fact if you got it sell it cause its not worth keeping.....it was wack as h$ll......"
4,Life is what you make it...,"Aspiring law student Hope Evans and thug on the run Life Thugstin meet during a chance encounter that will change both their lives forever. Though the two share one night of passion and go their separate ways, fate brings them together years later via the United States judicial system. And while both their lives have been altered dramatically one fact remains - their love for one another. The question is: How does love come into play when Hope is the prosecutor designated to imprison Life forever?Leo Sullivan was on point with this one. There are many messages in this novel, from our unjust legal system to finding comfort in religion. I was touched in one way or another by each point the author presented. While fiction is written to entertain, it's clear to me this writer's intent was to educate as well. His metaphors were original and added spice to this story that seems like it was really written from the heart.EnglishrulerARC Book Club Inc.Star Rating: 4.0"
5,All that !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WOW SINCE I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO REVIEW THE BOOK I WANT THE READERS LIKE ME TO KNOW THAT THIS BOOK IS GOOD AS HELL.......I DON'T LIKE TO GET INTO THE CHARACTERS. I WANT YOU TO GET THE BOOK SOUL ON IF THE BOOK IS GOOD SO YES IT IS YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED..........FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END IT WILL HAVE YOU GOING............AND THE END IS FIYA AZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THANQ LEO FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL READ.******ALL DAY LONG!
5,Zen Breakfast by Karunesh,"I've a complete collection of Karunesh, and I truly think that it's one of the best cd I ever known. It's a good way to get hight your spirit, heart and mind. I've no more words to say, just listen it."
5,Delightful story,This is a lovely story and makes for a great read aloud. The pictures are beautiful and the lesson that friendship is worth more than gold is subtly taught.
4,the gift,Tanuki's Gift by Tim Myers is a great book. It explores the value of friendship. It is a wonderful Japanese fable. The vibrant and expressive illustrations are terrific multimedia collages. The fable is very well written and will be a great addition to any children's book collection.
1,nothing special,"For starters, the title itself on the cover of the book is impossible to read because of the horrible font. You can't tell if it says tanuki or tahuki and that's just plain annoying because you have to look at it for a long time. the artwork inside is hardly memorable and let's hope you have perfect eyes because the font of the story is very small. I wear only one readers yet I struggle. Making it past that, you need to think about if you want to tell a story to your child about a chanting priest and his Buddha"
1,Save your money....,"I am a new user of FL Studio 5. I bought the boxed set and was bummed to find only a ""Getting Started"" manual inside. Not to worry, the guide assured me, the ""online help"" is massive.No the online was not massive and neither is this book. The previous reviewer was correct in saying this book is only intended for neophytes who are incapable of understanding the ""Getting Started"" manual.Learning FruityLoops or FL Studio is not a trivial endeavor. It takes a lot of time, a lot of practice, a lot of web surfing for samples, ideas, examples, etc.I am 95% certain this book will not be worthwhile for you. If you only want to learn a ""little"" FL Studio, stick with the online help and the tutorials at flstudio.comIf you want to gain a thorough knowledge of FruityLoops, even the author's brother, whose post precedes mine, agrees that this isn't the book."
2,I WAS EXPECTING MORE,"THE BOOK IS THE BASIC OUT LINE OF THE PROGRAM IT EXPLAIN THE THINGS I KNEW ALREADY,I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WHO AREJUST STARTING OUT. SOMEONE NEED TO DO A BOOK WITH MORE INFOTHAN THE BASICS"
5,GREAT FOR TODDLERS,My 21 month old daughter LOVES this video. She has watched it since she was 12 months old. Even my 5 month old son loves to watch and listen. Canadians will recognize current personalities from Treehouse TV as well as old favourites from the 80s. Some of it is dated but kids still love it. Much better than most of the commercial offerings out there. I highly recommend this series.
4,Keep your friends,"If Henry Kissinger isn't a member of your weekly card crew invite this book to the game. Not only will it keep the cards going, it will add a couple twist and help settle any of those disputes that always seem to pop up.The easy to follow instructions along with the fun illustrations make this perfect for teaching new games to both the beginner and the old timer."
5,cleared rosacea,"There seemed to be nothing that cleared my rosacea. It wasn't bad, but my face always looked a little sunburned and my nose was always red. I started with the smaller bottle of Seabuckthorn Oil just to see if it would work. It cleared the redness. I have bought the 120 capsule bottle and am taking 3 a day. I am very satisfied with the results."
1,"Bad company, waste of product","The company took way longer than the estimated arrival date, and when I contacted them to find out what was taking so long, they didn't get back to me until after the product had finally arrived. Plus, their response was automated and didn't address my problem at all. It was very frustrating. The product is supposed to help with skin and weight problems, but I've been using it as directed for a few months now and have not noticed a difference with either my skin or weight. I will not purchase again, and I recommend Amazon stop doing business with this company."
1,Have not received,I have waited 17 days and not received the product. Contacted source through Amazon and was told they would reship. I am so spoiled to Amazon Prime and being able to track items and I am trying to be patient!!! Cannot comment on item because I have not received it.
1,side effects-reaction,"Dr Oz promoted this product on TV and I bought it because of Dr Oz... I used it for 3 days and fainted in a store.. I woke up after an ambulance ride to ER and the ER doctor said there are side effects to this ""fainting, dizziness, and cardiac arrest""....this product cost me $10,000 in medical expenses... BE CAREFUL, GOD BLESS"
2,Would not recommend!~.........,"Would not recommend!~.........Balanceuticals Seabuckthorn Oil, 120 Soft gels.......a waste of money ad pricey....impulse buy and after seeing on TV another fad that does nothing!~"
3,Not Up To Par,"What you've got here is a rehash of old K+D stuff from a couple of years ago. Several of the tracks already appear on the amazing ""K+D Sessions"". The others are basically straight from the Count Basic albums. Count Basic himself is a mid-level talent in the acid-jazz genre. Fairly Milquetoast. This CD is another example of Shadow Records cashing in on the few K+D recordings they still have the rights to (along with the equally boring ""Conversions"" mix, released in America against the will of K+D). Check out ""Peace Orchestra,"" by Peter Kruder, or ""Tosca,"" by Richard Dorfmeister. These are much closer in form and execution to K+D's previous works."
2,Money for very old rope!,"If you want to hear the best offerings by K&D don't bother with this CD. The K&D Sessions and the K&D DJ Kicks CDs are the ones to buy. This CD offers nothing new, in fact most of it is a couple of years old. Be it record company greed or a large tax bill for Peter and Richard, this CD is money for very old rope."
3,half a great CD,"A collection of remixes done for Count Basic by Kruder & Dorfmeister, both together and separately. The mixes where the two mold the source material more to their own desires are by far the best of the bunch. ""Gotta Jazz"" and ""Speechless Drum & Bass"", both of which turn up on The K&D Sessions, are the standouts here."
2,"Not bad, not good","If you have K&D the Remixes, you already have the best from this CD. Otherwise, there aren't really any high points on any of the tracks, and it gets monotonous. There is less of the Vienna sound and more of a hip hop Basia sound."
3,POOR QUALITY,"There is no Color as such,everything is pink, NO CREDITS on the beginning at all. the film just starts.The first 21 minutes as a portion of the screen blacked out at the top of the picture.Full Screen Pan & Scan , soft focus.,nothing to recommend itThe film itself, is quite good,women prisoners on Devils Island ,being treated badly by the guards.Buy it by all means, but beware the condition of the print."
2,"BONANZA, THIS IS NOT",THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUTTHE TELEVISION SERIESBONANZA. IF THATSWHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.
5,Worked great!,"First of all, the dish is made well. It's nice and thick, heavy, has an unglazed bottom, and is smooth everywhere else. Seems to be of good construction. The only thing that bothered me was that the blue logo inked on the bottom of this dish smeared when I first washed it. Not really a big deal, but I'd rather have a sticker or a logo that doesn't smear. But maybe this was the idea, that it would wash off.I made my first soufflé ever only a couple days after receiving this dish. It turned out superbly! The even heat through this dish made an even rise on my souffle. And cleaning up was very easy (partly thanks to all the butter greasing the dish, but also from the smooth inside).This dish is excellent! I would buy more in a heartbeat, if I needed them."
2,So So,"This would be a fine mirror to use for travel, but it is so small, and magnified so much that you can only see an eye or a mouth at one time. You have to hold it in your hand to use and not being lighted is a handicap as well."
3,Works but flimsey.,"I purchased this mirror thinking it would be the exact same mirror I purchased a few years ago. The quality was not the same.I noticed the side hinges on the new mirror were looser. The mirror barely holds it's position. It is also a lot lighter than the older version. Other than being cheeply made, it does do the job, mirror is not distorted and folds nicely for travel."
5,Excellent...,"In the last year I've purchased 4 of the Jerdon Travel Mirrors for family members and everyone loves 'em; three 7x 5.5 inch and one 10x 3 inch. Very nice well made attractive mirrors for home use or travel and they look and function perfectly. These are priced right on Amazon and if found elsewhere they're almost twice the price. The 7X side is a good all around magnification to keep yourself looking like a movie star...well, the best possible.Update Nov 19 2012...Just made another purchase."
3,Mirror,"This mirror is very nice, however the magnification is too much it makes the image distorted, so I only use the regular mirror."
5,An untraditional search for a loving God,"Do all roads lead to God? Perhaps, for the dedicated seeker. Some roads are short and direct, such as traditional Judaism and Christianity. Others are long and indirect, like the ancient labyrinths, requiring greater energy and determination.In Awestruck, Joan Weimer candidly discusses her own winding spiritual journey. Put off by the masculine God in traditional Judaism, she is intrigued by the images of the Black Madonna throughout Europe. Perhaps the Madonna represents the personal, loving and feminine side of God, neglected by traditional religions?At the end of the book, we are uncertain if Joan Weimer is at the end of her pilgrim's road. Has she stopped with a distant God, as so many have done? Or is she continuing to pursue a personal relationship with God, perhaps through a modified Judaism? Clearly a sequel is required!"
1,Won't run on recent versions of Windows,"I ordered this product. I read in instruction booklet that it does not seem to have been upgraded to run on any Windows version since Windows 3.x. In other words, I couldn't load it on my Windows 7 operating system computer.I took to two different computer service shops, in a last ditch effort to get it to run. Both said essentially the same thing. That it won't work on later versions of windows. One even called several support numbers on the product and found the the original company was bought by a company that chose not to support the software with new drivers that would allow it to operate with recent versions of Windows."
2,far inferior to the original,"If you at all liked Seven Souls you will probably find this to be a disappointment. The remixes add little of value, dont create any genuinely new interpretations of the original. Seven Souls remains one of my favorite records of all time, if you are looking at this CD and dont have the original, get that instead."
3,Bad bulb,"I was really excited to get this mirror for my new bathroom. My husband uses it when he shaves and I use it for my makeup. It is very sturdy but with one week of use, not even turning the light on everyday, suddenly one time the bulb went off. That's why it is not 5 stars..."
4,Two sided mirror,"While the price of this mirror is really good, the light output is not very good. Its easy to mount and plug in, but darn it, they need to have a more powerful bulb to give more light....."
4,Jerdon 5X Magnification Lighted Wall Mirror,The mirror is easy to install. It is very well made. It is easily adjustable for different views. The only thing I noticed is that the light isn't too bright. Overall I'm very satisfied with the mirror.The magnification side makes applying makeup a breeze. Especially for those of us who are getting to an age when our eyes aren't what they used to be.
1,Save your money!,"This mirror is lame at best! It does not provide any more lighting than I already have. It is lit by one small night-light size bulb in the middle of the housing. The edge of the mirror is frosted which blocks more light. I expected a round fluorescent bulb inside. The company charges a 20% ""reprocessing fee"" so it's not worth returning. Total waste of money."
5,Wall-mount lighted make-up mirror,"I have wanted a wall-mount lighted make-up mirror for many years. I finally broke down and went searching for one on the internet and found this Jerdon model which had all the features I wanted. I ordered it and have been extremely pleased with it. Thinking that I was so pleased with it, I ordered one for each of my daughters. They, too, are enjoying the Jerdon."
1,Theory....not practically helpful,"If you need to decide how to rate an area, this book might be useful. However, if you want to know how to wire a motor from a Class 1 area to a non-rated area, this isn't going to do you any good. An an engineer, I appreciate a good theory on 'why things are the way they are'. As someone trying to figure out how to wire a thermocouple in an ex-proof application, this book isn't going to do you much good."
1,The advertising for this book misled me,"I bought this book as an author of fiction, hoping to get my first novel accepted by a publisher. The book seemed to be advertised for this purpose, so I bought it. I found it almost completely useless for my purposes, and my low rating of it reflects this.The book may be very useful for other people. It's for someone who is doing the marketing of the book to the public. The advice for this may be great (I don't know as I'm not doing that). It also gives lists of resources which the marketer can use, but these are heavily biased toward the USA.If you are trying to sell a book to the public in the USA, this may be just the book for you. But it was no use to me."
4,Simple Ideas to get you started,"If you haven't read anything else about marketing your book, then this is a good place to start. I've included it in my box of resources and I recommend it to my writing group."
2,Too sparse,This is really nothing more than a directory. It is useful but the bottom line is that this is just an overpriced list of phone numbers and websites.
4,Wildlife Painting,"I purchased this book to replace the one I already owned, which I loaned out and never received it back. It is a book which does contain valuable information, however, I do not believe a beginning artist will benefit as much as an experienced artist. It really assumes the reader has knowledge of technique, color mixture, brush performance and other elements of fine art. A good reference book, not a teaching book.Jill Ball"
2,Another pretty book,"This is a beautiful book but not a lot of help if you're learning. It's more for an accomplished artist who would like to fine tune their craft. If I had seen the book before I bought it, I definetly would have saved my money."
3,NOT for Beginners!,"I purchased this book, but it is definitely for more advanced artists. Like some of the other comments, it does go along in great leaps and bounds, and is not well suited for people just learning to paint. I ended up giving it to my artist friend because she is among the calibre of artists featured. I am not worthy of this book, that's for sure. Beautiful art though!"
2,ALSOP CLEARVIEW GEL,"There must be something this viewer is doing incorrectly, for I'm finding this product to have messed with my LCD screen terribly. It is much more difficult to watch than the previous two spots on the screen - I wish I'd never attempted using ANY product if this is how we are misinformed. The reason I purchased this larger screen is due to eye surgery, less strain, and possibly might be happier than with the ""glass"" type (that currently sits in storage)... Is there anyone who might have had a similar experience? And, where can we purchase the soft cloths without buying the entire kit? Thanks for your time"
4,A good replacement clock.,"I bought this as a replacement clock in a bathroom. One nice feature was that it set itself; you have to indicate time zone, which is o.k. The only thing was that when it set itself, it set it in another time zone than I indicated, so had to re-set. I will know more of its capabilities when the time changes in the Fall."
5,The Michael Handbook,"I am amazed at the eye opening concepts that this book has put forth. I think its a good read for anyone interested in studying ""The Soul""."
1,its ok .....just so and so,this product is .....just ok not so much good.as after some time the band become loose.......and it looses its property to control the double chin.in real sense i m not satisfied from this product.moreover the design is not so accurate to tone up the side jaws.
2,Could not use it because the wrap was too small to fasten around my head.,"The wrap's ends didn't stretch enough to fasten Velcro fasteners around my head. It seemed to be a child-sized version, but it didn't say it on the package. I am not a giant and my head is an average size. I had to return it.This was actually my third Velform Chin Wrap - I had purchased the product in the past from verseo.com, and I was happy with it."
4,OK,I did use this from time to time...do't r eally know if it works but it surely is tight under your double chin. Weather or not it helps it must if you keep it on 2-3 times a day!!! Like I said it is better than not using anything or surgery.
1,Don't waste your money,This product does not do anything. I used the whole thing: no difference whatsoever. Spend your money on something else.
1,Hopes & Wishes Are All You're Left With,"Yes I am one of those unfortunate people that now have a double chin, which is rather ugly as everyone knows! I don't want lipo-suction or any other evasive treatment so I hoped this would offer an alternative... it does not. So save your money, the lotion without a nice scent does nothing and the wrap is so darn tight it gives you a headache. If you want to try it for yourself, do it while you are alone so your spouse or loved one does not have to see you all wrapped up with all your face & chin fat pressed out front making your face look swollen! Sooooo attractive! haha ;) Next alternative... so far I have just been kneading my chin with my fist to tighen it up, seems to be working better."
2,Stopped working after 1 week,Not impressed with how it was made. Tried a new battery after just one week and still didn't work.
2,"TENDENTIOUS, BIASED, SHALLOW","What pretends to be a serious book is 2 parts gossip to one part recycled scholarship, coupled with cynical, snide and simplistic divisions of the good guys (all 19th century thinkers who did not commit ""intellectual suicide"" by remaining theists for all the whole reasons) versus the bad guys (those who did). In his criticism of Marx, Wilson describes a particularly convoluted passage as ""These gaseous exhalations could have burst forth from only one geyser: a London address ..."" of some forgotten 19th century writer (p. 81). I frankly thought he was describing what came off his own word processor"
1,I couldn't Finish It,"I just got so nauseous. I am not Christian or relgious by any stretch, but I get so tired of those who take such GLEE in attacking religion and tearing it down.I originally picked this book up under protest to begin with, but under strong recommendation of a professor. Perhaps my prior bias has contributed to my frustration in reading this book. But I should have kept my own council and stayed strictly away."
1,Something's Missing,"This is a history of philosophic thought through the nineteenth century that traces how G-d disappeared from the belief system of the philosophers of England (and America). However, it seems to be one-sided. Plus, in the final chapter we somehow end up with Pope John Paul II. I'm not sure how we ended up there. There is no thread that follows unbroken from the Catholic Modernists of the turn of the Twentieth Century to the turn of the Twenty-first Century in what the author has offered. I feel as if the author was trying to justify the reason for studying the philosophical history of the ninteenth century by saying such history has led to today's Catholic Church by just making the jump from circa 1900 to circa 2000. It doesn't work for me. Thumbs down."
1,Another jab at Christian faith from a cultured despiser,I'll pass. The man who used to be A.N. Wilson is a sad fellow
2,OK but then what?,"Just as many other authors who wrote about this matter. They just so quickly and smartly give all the evidence about the non-existence of God and that satisfies them. What makes things even worse is how thousands of people grab the book, read it, and come here in victory and write their review to support it. You people might be able to destroy people's belief in some answer, but then that's all your purpose? If you are so smart and knowledgable, why don't you provide a substitute? Evolution and the Big Bang? Where did that come from anyway? I am really amazed. What is so good in showing your hate for the idea of God's existence just for the heck of it? I am sick of all your great efforts to show your hatred of God. As long as you - and your readers - fail to give me a substitute, I will always continue to reject all your claims altogether."
2,Some truly bad writing,"I expected hot steamy, horrifying, and weird. what I got was bland, and a little sick in some cases. I have never heard of three quarters of these authors and when I checked out their other books I found them just as disinteresting as the dreck published in this book."
1,Not even interesting.,This book is filled with short stories from authors that write like they have never published anything. Stories are incomplete and weird. Was not impressed at all.
2,i dont care for this product,this product didnt do much but it DID stain my vintage-looking boots a dark shade of brown. i'm not pleased.
3,lots of unknown tunes,I really wanted Sleepwalk and this disc set was just ok. DVD would not play on my player. I should have just boughtthe mp3 of the two songs I wanted.
1,good book if you don't care about logic,"The author claims conservative Christians make better fathers and husbands than mainline Christians and non-religious men. To support his claims he uses some statistical wizardry (really just hiding things). He finds in the process that conservative Christians are more likely to beat their wives and kids than are the others. Yet, in the end, he still claims conservative Christian men make better fathers and husbands. Right!"
4,If you like Neil's acoustic stuff then you'll love this!,"This concert finishes alot stronger than it starts. Songs include Crime In the City, Too Far Gone, Ohio, After the Goldrush, Rockin' In the Free World, and This Notes for You. He does a wonderful job with Rockin' In the Free World (A much better cut than that of the album). You'll see the same Martin guitars that you saw in Unplugged."
4,"Great Wallet, but EXTREMELY SLOW TO SHIP","Love the wallet. However, don't believe KOYONO when they say that the item ships within 1-2 business days. Mine took 9 or 10 days just to ship! About one week after I placed the order, I received an email from the company president saying that due to record demand, they were behind schedule in fulfilling orders. He thanked me for bearing with his company through ""these difficult times"" (HA! The letter also blatantly plugged several other KOYONO products.) The company president also asked me to email him directly if I had any concerns about my order. When I did enquire about the estimated shipping date, I received no response. KOYONO could have at least made an attempt to salvage some customer satisfaction by upgrading the shipping on delayed orders."
1,"terrible product, terrible customer service","I found this while looking for a slim wallet for my husband, but it was certainly nothing like they described. The reviewers who said it could NOT really be called a wallet are right. It is a piece of leather (I think) folded with two or three small slots for items, money etc. Certainly not worth $29. I wanted to return, and had to send 3 emails, to get info. Then returned it and it took almost 6 wks. to get credit, and company implied they only did credit it then because I complained (rather loudly), said they weren't yet sure I had actually returned it etc.Since I posted this review, I, too, received an email offer from the Pres. of the Co. of $20 to remove my negative review. He also called my house, to try to ""reason"" with me. NO DICE. My review stays."
2,Mediocre,"Picked one of these up and have been using it over the last 2 months. The quality of the leather is not that great. As far as the design, if I put it in my pocket so the open end is facing down I always seem to end up dumping my ID/credit cards into my pocket or pulling it out wrong dumps the contents onto the floor. I've moved back to my traditional bi-fold wallet."
2,Not worth it.,"I bought this for a trip to Japan, as I love the concept and like to travel light - often carrying just a money clip with cash and a few cards. This fits somewhere in between a clip and a small wallet, both of which I prefer to this item. It does not have the functionality of a wallet, so I often find myself without a critical card - and it does not have the true slim feeling of just a clip, so for me it fits right in between, in a spot I find myself not liking. Good concept, poor practical execution. Not recommended."
2,"Not thin enough, didn't credit my Visa back",This is better than a normal wallet but it's still too thick. I normally carry my cards around loose (4 cards + some cash). The wallet by itself is about 2x thicker than my stack of cards and when I insert everything it's like 4-5x thicker. Pretty thick. I also like the idea of wearing it in my front pocket but I can feel it pressing on my thigh and the profile really sticks out.I wouldn't have even bothered posting a review in the first place if they credited my Visa back. I returned it over 6 weeks ago and it sounds like other people have had the same problem. No response to my email so I just disputed the charge with Visa.
2,Simple but hard,It is a slim wallet which is just basically four pieces of leather sewed together on two sides. Having to place more than one card in a section makes it difficult to get the right card out. Having to fold paper money makes it difficult to determine denomination without pulling out all the bills. If you wont small try the eagle Creek small wallet. It is made out of durable nylon instead of animal skin.
2,too simple,"Too simple, not enough pockets and it could have been designed better. Its probably not for me, my money slips out. If you have a few stuff in your wallet then this will not work, if you don't have money, cards or IDs then this wallet is for you."
4,Getting used to it,This was a gift to my husband as he has been advised by the doctor to not sit on his wallet. He is in a period of adjustment with it as it is very different form a traditional wallet but so far he is liking it.
3,It's OK for occasional use,Everything is lumped together and you have to be careful pulling things out of this wallet. But it does the job in keeping everything you have in a very small/slim profile. So if i am going to a conference for example where i am going to be walking around all day I use it instead of my bigger wallet that makes a humongous bump in my front pants pocket (I only carry my wallet in a front pocket). So I will keep this wallet for accoasional usage.
2,great idea- quality not up to par with the price,"The purchased a slimmy about a year ago- the design works exactly like advertised and you will be surprised how much you can actually fit in such a small space!About a month or so after using it on a daily basis, I began to notice a problem where the interior fabric seemed to be separating from the leather exterior, causing ripples in the fabric on the inside. I contacted Koyono about this and they sent me a replacement and asked for pictures from the first to send to their manufacturer. While I though this was an isolated mistake, the replacement slimmy also has the same defect- the interior fabric is no longer tight and has actually gotten worse than the first. This may or may not bother you, but for the price, I believe they should have worked this out.has anyone else had this problem??"
2,Too slimmy for me,"This is a well made wallet but is far too small for me. It holds very little and everything was so tight that things tended to fall out when other things were removed. It may be great for some people but make sure that your realize how little it holds before you decide to order one. Reader SMO is correct that this wallet came in second to the ""All-ET"" in a New York Times review by someone who otherwise is one of my favorite writers. (I bought and threw away my ""All-ET"" before I decided to try the Slimmy.) It is true that the ""ALL-ET"" is the slimmest of them all. But I also found it to be slightly less than useless. The material is extremely smooth so that credit cards kept on falling out. It was also poorly made (or maybe it's the materials), so that the stitching became frayed. I'm sorry but a pox on both their houses. I'll go for a traditional wallet from here on."
2,"Not bad, but if you want a really thin wallet...","This is not a bad leather wallet, but if you read the New York Times review, you'll see they actually preferred another wallet -- the ""ALL-ETT Billfold"" -- over the Slimmy. The ""all-ett"" is made of a much thinner material and places your cards side-by-side so it can hold a lot more than a Slimmy. It's cheaper too!"
5,Very convenient,"Bought this for my husband who is legally blind. It works great for him. He is able to access all his cards, cash and receipts with ease and without fear of things falling out. He is able to open each section wide to rifle through items for the correct one but then closes back up compact for his front pocket. It's also a very attractive wallet. When this one wears out will will replace it with the same one."
4,"Fantastic, no complaints","This is my first front pocket wallet. I love it. I was impressed with how much it actually holds without compromising its ""slimness"". At all times I have 0-5 bills, 4 cards, and 0-5 receipts in it and it is completely unnoticeable in my average fitting slacks and jeans. Everything fits well inside the pockets and doesn't stick out like a small overstuffed wallet. I've only had the wallet for 1 month but nothing has slipped out so far, it is still in perfect condition and hasn't stretched at all. Also, I have no problem adding or removing any items. A dollar bill only requires 1 to 2 folds to get tucked away nicely. And my rear end is nothing but smiles"
2,Eh,"It honestly isn't the best out there, but all means not the worst...The vocals remind me too much like mindless drone zombies"
2,fireball rc motor,"i put this motor in my traxxas stampede and decided first thing ill do is break it in. it all went smoothly and i was happy. but the next time i ran it, i drove 50 feet down my road and about halfway back the car stoppe. i figured it was out of range or dead batteries so i go to get the car and look at the motor and the cable melted off"
5,great for the price,"I bought this to replace the stock motor in my rock crawler. I had to water break in before installing it and that was pretty quick. The only problem I can think of is it gets really hot while in use. I put a cooling fan on it and it works great now. I am going to invest in the replacement brushes (in case they burn out). The stock motor was a 35 turn, so this really pepped her step when I get a full fist on the throttle! Definitely recommend to anyone needing an easy hop-up for a stock rig."
4,Good Mirror,I bought this for my wife as a christmas present last year. She loves it. Uses it everyday and its like very dark in our room. I would recommend this product.
3,:),I don't know what I was expecting but it is very light. Lighter than expected! I love this product because when I finish i get so many compliments on my makeup. Ive heard that I look airbrushed!
5,Great,The item came early. My mom loved it for her Christmas Gift. She loved the 5X Magnification. This will definately replace the one she recevied 15 years ago.
1,Just like all the others,"If you look at the back of this mirror, you will see the metal stand....that holds the mirror up,... is held onto the back by 2 pieces of plastic. If you leave your mirror in the upright position all the time, this does not create a problem. I, however, need to fold the mirror and put it away when not in use.The plastic that holds the stand part on breaks very quickly, making the mirror useless. We have tried taping, hot gluing, and epoxying brackets onto the back of the mirror to hold the stand on, but nothing sticks to the plastic for long. If you leave the mirror in place, a nice mirror. If you need to move it or put it away after use, then this is not the best mirror for you."
3,ok,"This broke with very little use. I found a way to work around it, and still use this mirror. The amount of light is great and I use the magnifying side to pluck my lovely mostache hairs (menopause sucks) and when I pluck my eyebrows. I even use it when my husband is in the shower and I need to put my make-up on."
3,It's okay,"I like that this mirror has three panels. I also like that one side of the middle mirror is magnified. The lighting settings are basically just a color shield over the actual light. I personally wish it were just one light setting. The lighting is not a natural light so in my opinion I don't get a realistic view of my face and makeup application. I would, however, recommend this product to maybe a teenager who is new to makeup."
3,It's ok,"It's ok..........Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror, 5x Magnification my other one cost 50-60 and so worth it....lights are pretty dim"
1,Piece of...garbage,"Cheesy construction and lag time for the lights, I can live with. However, the four settings are controlled by a slider, and the slider won't move to the ""Daytime"" setting. Something inside the case is blocking its movement; looking through the slit, it looks like there's a piece of metal there. The case cannot be opened so it's impossible to get in there and see whether it can be fixed. (AND it was a gift, ordered more than 30 days ago, so Amazon won't let me exchange the defective item for another one. Augh!)You might be satisfied with the one you get, if your expectations of quality aren't high, but personally, I wouldn't risk it again."
1,Distorted,"I have been using Lighted Makeup Mirrors since I was 16 years old. Now that I am over 50, I need the magnified mirror to apply my cosmetics. The magnified mirror tends to make you look distorted. I will be returning the mirror for a refund.The one feature that I really like on this model is having an outlet for my curling iron, however, I can do without that and I will go back to the Conair."
2,Not a happy customer...,"The lighting itself was fine. However the left mirror would flop back as the hinge just wasn't tight enough. I was willing to overlook it, as it would stay as long as I didn't fidget with it... Then it flatout broke on me after only 1 year of PART TIME use. One day it just would not turn on. I had my tech guy look at it and was informed that (after shipping) the parts would cost so much that it would be cheaper to just buy a new one. I'm going with Conair this time."
3,it's OK,"I had no expectations when I purchased it, so I thinks it's fair to say it's OK. I also grew up using the Clairol version (which I absolutely loved) therefore, in comparison, I must point out that on the unit I purchased the micas that change the color settings for the lighting are not aligned equally on both sides, so the color output is not even; the magnification could be stronger than it is but I can work with it. Overall, it serves the purpose of sitting on my vanity and helping me see better when I apply my makeup, which is what I needed.Fair price, fair product."
1,"Joining the ""Thumbs-down"" Club, here.","Deal o'the Day. ""Cool,"" I thought. ""I've always wanted one of those."" I thought it would be brighter than the 40 watt bulb and magnified mirror, which I was using. OMG!! Dim, dim, dim. A total piece of useless trash.My current thinking is to rip the mirror out, prop it on my stapler, and use the 40 bulb lamp, previously jerry-rigged.I am soooooo not happy, with this ""lighted"" mirror."
1,"Not like the ConAir, could be better","First off, the gels for the lighting are not the best- they don't give the same colored light cast on left & right. Also, this mirror is attached horizontally, meaning the mirrors flip end over end & not left to right. For those who may be wondering why this matters, with the Conair (sp?), the mirror spins left/right, so if you want to see a side-shot of your face, you can. Not with this one. Side mirrors only close when regular mirror is faced forward. If you MUST have a less expensive tri-fold mirror, this is okay, but you'll be disappointed if you had a conair one and are replacing it."
4,Not SUPER bright but does the trick.,I have been using this mirror for a week now and it is serving my needs just fine. The lights aren't super bright but bright enough. I like the side mirrors a lot. It's very versitile.
5,At last,I Purchased 3 makeup mirrors before finding the one I liked. The lighting was always inadequate. But the Jerdon lighting was exactly what I was looking for and the magnification is perfect.I highly recommend Jerdon.
1,Terrible mirror,The magnifying mirror on this is so distorted & wavy it looks like you are looking into a circus fun house mirror. I returned it immediatly.
4,What's the Problem?,"After reading all of the negative reviews, I almost didn't buy this. But, I threw caution to the wind and plunked down my cash. Have had the mirror for over a month now. Use it every morning with the lights. Have had no problems."
1,As Charles Barkley would say it's tear-ri-ble!,Terrible! Terrible! The first one I got the light switch was jammed and wouldn't slide. I returned it giving the item another chance and this time the lights were not in sync - one side was on day while the other was on night! Tear-ri-ble!
1,"very poor product, save your money","I received this mirror as a gift on March 1 and it totally died out 2 weeks ago. Holding the on switch down doesn't make any sense because the switch is ""down"" once you turn the mirror on. Replacing the bulbs is a joke as you're suppose to get an electrician to do the job? I've had many mirror over the years that have broken due to the glass or frame but never had this problem. What a huge waste of money and it's only been 5 months. I hate this disposable attitude that so many companies are coming up with. This has to be my first and biggest disappointment with Amazon and one of their products. I wouldn't recommend this mirror to anyone. I'm sure someone out there has one and it working perfect...not me!!!"
1,"Another sub-par, ""Made in China"" product.","Bought the first of March 2011, failed today July 30, 2011. Do the math. Lights began to flicker and then just quit working. There is apparently no way to replace the bulbs. Would not recommend."
1,Jerdon Lighted Mirror,"I was very excited to receive a new tri-fold lighted mirror to replace one the one my cat broke, but horribly disappointed in the lights - they would not come on (very dim like a flourescent trying to come on at the beginning) and just would not brighten up like they should - I returned it. It may have been a fluke with this particular one?"
1,Light bulbs burning out after 3 months,"Changing my review because, I purchased this for my teenage daughter in Dec. She really liked it. Well I posted a 5 star review first and then one of the light bulbs started turning black and the lights won't come on. I don't know what to do now because the mirror didn't come with a warranty. We've only had it for 3 months. I would not recommend this mirror. There is no way to change the light bulbs. I am attempting to tear it apart. We are bummed :("
2,Good While it Lasted,"This mirror was great while it lasted, which was only about 6 months, and then the lights burned out. I had a similar one prior to this that lasted 20 years! I would try another brand next time."
4,nice makeup mirror,"I have had my mirror for about 1 month and have enjoyed having it. I like the fact that it has an plug on the front so I can plug my curling iron up. It is compact and easily able to be taken on a trip. My only complaints are that the lights seems funny to me. It has the standing day,office,evening, home settings, but it doesnt seems to go all the way over into the day position. so the lenses aren't the same on both sides (one is green and the other purple). Now maybe it's intended to do this, but I am suspicious that's it's not b/c I can't get the switch all the way over to ""day"". My other complaint is that the side mirrors seem too small-but hey it's portable so what can I expect- I can't take a giant vanity set with me on vacation. I would purchase it again still. It serves my beautificaiton needs:-)"
5,excellent mirror,"This product is hard to find in retail stores. So I relied on amazon for a vanity mirror. This particular product was rated highly, & I must agree. I've had not 1 problem with it. Im illuminated better than I would be in any other light so to speak. It is the best vanity mirror I've come across, & im a stylist w/20 years of experience. I bring it with me on set & I couldn't be happier with its performance. Thank you amazon for my life saver."
2,Kinda cheap,"The mirror wasn't entirely what I expected. It's rather small so you have to put your face just inches from the mirror. The light doesn't reflect off of the side mirrors very well, that's probably because the light is weak and sets to far back into the unit. Plus it has these different shades that distort the strength of the brightness which is the manufacturers' idea of different environments. For me...it was a waist of money, but for others they might like it. I won't be the person to celebrate or promote a poor design."
1,I hate this mirror,"This mirror was a replacement for a round style 10x magnification mirror that had a ballast which finally gave out. I cannot get used to the magnification being so small, I miss the 10x magnification so much that I kept using the 10x even with no light. Also the round 10x mirror was MUCH brighter. This mirror seems to have Ok light at the center, but low light in the middle. The worst part of this product is that it trips my hairdryer (which is plugged into a different outlet) almost every time I use it. I live in a new house and have no other issues with anything tripping things in outlets and my old mirror never did that."
2,Nope.,"I do like the side mirrors, but the light is just really poor. If I were you, I'd keep looking. I am."
4,Not bad for the money...,"I purchased this lighted mirror for my chick as a Christmas gift, and overall I'd say it was a good value. She's pretty happy with it overall, though I think the only complaint might be that the on-board lights are a little dim, and the plastic and shade control knob feels a little cheap. If you put these considerations up against the cost it works out as a fairly good value."
4,"Box was torn into pieces and taped up by the seller, sold as brand new :(",It looked new or refurbished. Mount/Stand is flimsy plastic and could break easily so you have to treat this thing like a newborn. I guess they made it that way so you can keep buying more of these products. Could be built more sturdy. But everything works fine. 4 stars.
4,"mirror, mirror",The mirror is good for doing hair and some makeup. The lights are not bright enough for tweezing. It is large and takes up more room than I thought. It will be used but still another mirror is needed for closeups.
2,TOO MUCH GLARE,I purchase the JERDON mirror from the customer reviews. It has too much glare for my household lighting. The mirror was not functional. The casing was great and the stand was a little flemsy. No matter what lighting I switch to on the mirror (it has five)the floresuent lighting caused too much glare. And just forget about the maginification. That was horrible.
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"This hasn't been used yet as it is a Christmas present for my youngest grand-daughter. It seems to be the same model as one we'd gotten for her mom when she was a teen ager. It worked so well that she took it with her when she got married. It lasted for 20 years! My grand-daughter has a vanity but the mirror is too far away to put on make-up so she 's been improvising with a desk lamp. If it's anything like her mom's, it will be fantastic. I remember her mom's well. The side lights, the magnification, lighting choices.I read all the negative reviews and bought it anyway. I'm not worried about it. I'm sure it will be perfect. I'll update this review after she uses it a bit."
1,Magnification mirror was distorted,The magnification mirror was distorted. It was difficult to see in it. I had the exact same one for 2 years and the bulbs burned out. I ordered one online through Amazon.com and it came defective. Sent it back.
2,Really disappointed,"When I got this mirror last year for Christmas I was really pleased with it. It had different lighting for day, evening, etc. The 5X magnification was perfect so I could apply eye makeup without glasses, which would be impossible. But after about 7-8 months, one of the bulbs became very dim. My husband tried to find a way to take it apart to replace the bulb, but there isn't one. All in all it was a waste of money. My old Conair from 20+ years ago still works, but it's only 3X magnification. But! I'm back to using it anyway. Too bad. It had everything I needed, just didn't last."
2,Fine till the bulbs go out,I've had this mirror since Oct. 2010 and it was great till last week when the bulbs went out and there is apparently no way to replace them. If you don't mind having to replace this item in about 2 years or so then I'd say go for it. As for me I'll be looking for another similar item that I won't have to trash in such a short time span. What a waste!
1,Could be better,"In theory this is a great product, however the only part of the mirror that magnifiyes and moves is the small center part. The stand is somewhat limited and you have to have it on the right stand to be able to use the mirror. It's sad to me that they can't make the product as they advertise the product to be.Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror, 5x Magnification"
2,You cannot change the bulbs when they die.,Loved it for 2 years. Best light ever. But it is disposable. SAD :(The magnification is great. Like the outlet for the blow dryer in the front.Just did not last long enough to suit me.
1,A bunch of BS,This is crappy craptastic craptacular as can be. Too bad I fell for the video that played on youtube. Thanks for nothing Sally hansen.
1,Sorry but its JUNK,I bought this for my daughter to put on her make-up. It seems that the bulbs burn out after a few months and cannot be replaced. I should have read reviews. If you search the web you will find product has bulb problems. Ened up buying a Conair TM7LX-320 Illumina Three panel Make-up Mirror w/4 Light Settings.
1,Dangerous Product,"I am very disappointed in this purchase. I got it in Nov and after using it for 2 months, it started tripping the circuit breaker. I can no longer turn it on with an electrical problem. Amazon only takes Christmas returns for items purchased after Nov 1 and I purchased Oct 29. So now I'm stuck with an item I can't use. Save your money and buy something else."
5,love the mirror,"I had a mirror like this and it broke so tried a couple that I found downtown and they just didn't work well, bad lighting, this one works great. I don't mind the delayed time to turn on, as it is just seconds."
2,"If you only want a mirror that last 2 years, buy it!","After my last mirror died after 30 years, yes 30 years! I think it was a conair, I searched and searched for a replacement. The Jerdon looked like close replacement. I was okay with it, the lighting really wasn't that bright but it was better than nothing. Then only after having it for 2 years, the lights went out and there is no repairing it! So if you don't mind, replacing your mirror every couple of years, go ahead and buy it, otherwise, I'd look at another one."
1,disappointing,"I am very disappointed in this item. I have had it less than one year, and it has died. The lights no longer work and apparently you cannot replace the bulbs. Seems it has no replaceable parts. Had I know that, I would not have purchased it. For the price, it certainly should have lasted long than a few months. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Not worth the hassle..,".I have owned two of the Jerdon mirrors, the first lasted a few years, (bulbs blew out one at a time). ""Okay"", I said, it was worth it. I purchased another mirror after a few months, the bulbs just would not stay on. (switch problem?)The plus side of these mirrors are the tubular fluorescent lights it houses. They give off a bright setting for applying make-up.The minus is that they can't be replaced and no one should have to become an electrician to attempt to fix this inferior product. Jerdon will not get a cent out of me again."
2,Not so great...,"I've had this product for a little over a year, and already, the bulbs are dying. The lights go on and then dim off within a minute. The previous make-up mirror I purchased lasted 15 years without the bulbs dying. Also, when pressing the on button to the right to turn it on, it often flips back to the left, and the lights turn off. I've had to push a stapler up against the switch to keep it to stay on."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I purchased the Jerdon JGL9W Lighted Mirror less than one (1) year ago. The lights have stopped working, and from what I can tell the lights can not be replaced. Do not purchase it unless you are willing to replace it within a year of buying the product.Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror"
2,Lights don't last and can't be changed..unless you're a pro,I bought this mirror for my teenage daughter for Christmas. It was similar to one I had and loved as a teenager. Major difference is that I had mine for about 6 years with no problems and this one lasted a whole 8 months before the lights blew out. Not a big deal...you would think...BUT they can only be changed by a professional electrician! What a joke!! A product costing less than $30 costs more than double that to replace the bulbs? Give me a break. If I had known that I would never have bought it. I guess I'll just have to deal with the make up in the bathroom...at least I can change those lights when they burn out. Maybe they should sell it cheaper and call it a disposable make up mirror. At least then consumers would understand they were not getting a quality product.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this mirror and it worked ok for about 9 months until one day it just stopped working. I contacted the manufacturer and they quickly replaced it with a new one. I have now had the new one for about 4 months and today it stopped working also. I have had another mirror by Clairol that worked for years and years with no problems. I would never buy a mirror by Jerdon again!! Save your time and money and purchase a different mirror.
1,What a stinker!,"I've probably owned 3 lighted makeup mirrors in my entire lifetime and I'm almost 50. The other 2 lasted for many, many years. This quit working properly after 6 months. The bulbs flicker and then shut off. I treated it well, never dropped it....there is no reasonable excuse for this to happen. I'm moving on to the Ott Lite mirror."
4,Jerdon Lighted mirror,"I was replacing an old Clairol mirror that I got in high school. I had read the other reviews and decided to give this one a try. It's not as bright as my old mirror and the center mirror is not as big, but I do like the side mirror format. It folds up nicely to fit in a drawer. No problems with the light, you just have to hold the button in like my old one. I'm happy with the purchase."
3,Lighted Mirror,"Product appears to have been properly packaged for shipping, and arrived in a timely manner, as advertised. I am impressed with the combination of lighting and magnificiation that this product offers. Nice!"
3,It does the job but could use improvement,"I like the size, I like the flip mirror with the magnification on one side. However, the light just isn't bright enough. The lighting where I do my makeup is horrible so I really really was relying on this mirror giving me all the lighting I needed to do my makeup. Now I find when I get to work in bright fluorescent lighting I didn't blend quite well enough because I thought I looked great in my dark room! I guess I will need to buy a new light fixture for my entire bedroom..."
2,"Yep, bulb issue","Recieved this mirror on September 12, 2011 and on October 12, 2011 the right bulb is dull and flickering. Will try to do as another reviewer and check on replacement, but of course I will have no mirror in the mean time.If not for the bulb issue, I would really like this mirror. Couldn't be more bummed."
2,Not bright,"I bought this based on its reviews, but it is just okay. The shipping was quick, and it was packed well. The biggest problem is that the light is not bright, even on daylight setting. The light is adjusted by colored filters moving across the bulbs, but they are not lined up well. So, when daylight is selected, I can see green bars along the edges of light. Additionally, part of the stand on the back is made of flimsy plastic and represents a very weak, unstable base that could easily break. Finally, a small thing, but the side doors only close when the unmagnified mirror-side is facing out. It's an annoying thing to have to keep flipping the mirror over in order to close the doors. Overall, I would not recommend this mirror if you are the least bit visioned-challenged. It simply is not bright enough."
1,I should've listened to reviews!,"I read many reviews prior to purchasing this ""lighted"" mirror but I was hopeful and on a budget. First off, it's bulky and not very attractive looking but for $30, I didn't mind it much. The lights where okay (again, not bad for $30) but not even two weeks of use, the lights went completely out. I was going to look at other reviews for ""tricks"" on how to get them working but I don't even want to go through the trouble. I should have dished out another $20 or so and got something of much better quality and design, definately not worth the effort of returning/waiting for refund/ordering a replacement. Don't waste your time or money."
2,It's alright,"The magnified mirror is really warbled. You pretty much have to get right up next to it for it to become clear enough to use. Also, my light switch doesn't move. It is stuck on the middle setting & won't budge. Since this lighting is adequate for the most part, I chose not to send it back. My luck on Amazon with just about ANY ""lighted"" device has been a bust. Getting tired of having to send things back. QC could definitely use some work."
1,Do NOT buy this !!!,I love love loved this mirror when it worked---bulbs went out in less than 6 months I loved it so much I gave it another chance---bulbs went out AGAIN in less than 4 months. Ridiculous.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,This mirror is a piece of junk because you cannot change the bulbs. Save your money and purchase an inexpensive mirror for $20.00 or less.
5,"LOVE, LOVE LOVE","All I can say is ""I love this mirror!"" I have always wanted a lighted makeup mirror, but couldn't find one with good reviews. This is the ticket. The lights are bright, there is a difference between all four settings and they all are beautiful. The magnifying side is just right at 5X. It is large but I like that. It would fit nicely on a makeup table (which I don't have.) I need to set it up each time I use it, but I find it worth the effort. I don't know anything about changing the lights because I havn't had a problem with them. But I know that every dollar you spend on this model is justified and worth it."
2,"Worked well for about 1 year, just when the warranty ran out.","The mirror was fine, large enough, the magnifying side was okay. The light settings were fine. It did its job. Unfortunately within one year of purchase, the lights stopped working completely making the mirror completely useless to me. Upon further inspection of the mirror, my husband and I realized there is no way to replace the lightbulbs which seems ridiculous. After using about 10-15 minutes a day most days of one year, it is junk. I will replace it with a more well known brand name and hope that their lightbulbs can be replaced."
2,SHORT TERM PRODUCT - THROW-AWAY MIRROR,"I did like this mirror for the year that the bulbs lasted, but there is no way to open the mirror to replace the bulbs that have burned out, so it is a product with a very short lifetime that apparently would need to be replaced yearly. Maybe it is supposed to be a gimmick but I don't know anyone who would buy another one so it sure backfires on Jerdon - the word is out. I purchased a new Ott-lite mirror with replaceable bulbs and like it much better than I did the Jerdon. Don't waste your money."
1,bought it. crapped out after 24 hours. booo.,"at first it worked great, then totally died after 24 hours. the previous one i have, has worked for 20 YEARS. not an exaggeration. i was very disappointed. so it's a roll of the dice here people."
2,"Not portable, takes lot of space","The mirror was fine but the whole unit takes a lot of space. It is heavy and non portable. I did not find the different settings for office light, home etc very useful."
4,Love the Mirror - Hate the Lights,"It's a great mirror, closes easily, three mirrors, adjustable stand, but the lighting is inadequate. Wish there were stronger bulbs or the option to replace them with better ones."
4,Outstanding Customer service,"I bought this mirror in February 2012. On 12/27 the bulbs quit working. I called Jerdon and faxed copy of Amazon invoice to them, and today I received a new mirror! You might say the bulbs should have lasted longer, but the warranty was ""No questions asked"""
1,Cheap Knock-Off!,"I purchased one of these last year and loved it! After extensive use, the light switch broke and the lights wouldn't turn on anymore (not from the bulbs) so instead of changing out the switch I decided this would be my Mother's Day present to myself. I was so excited to receive it in the mail. I am a makeup artist, so this mirror is great for work, travel and personal use.When I opened the box, immediately there were differences. The lights were dimmer and flickering. The logo was different. The mirror made my face look super wide and off color. No woman wants a wider face!!! Everything was different! After a closer look, I discovered that this was a cheap Chinese replica. I think the original was made in China too but this was a Chinese replica of a Chinese product!I sent it back and received a prompt refund, so thanks for that. However I want my original mirror back!!!"
1,frustrated,"You need an electrician to replace the bulbs?? They didn't even last a year. If you want a disposable mirror, this is the one."
1,Defective Mirror - Customer has to pay Return Postage,"Received Jerdon Mirror - JGL9W - plugged it in and the light doesn't turn on. Tried several different outlets....the product is defective. Sally Beauty Supply doesn't pay for return postage costs on returns. I will never order from them again. Learned a lesson from this purchase, check the return policy of vendors doing business on Amazon.com."
3,"Very harsh, direct light.","The florescent lamps shine directly into the users eyes. Even with the colored filters, my wife was too sensitive to the glare.Seems like a well made product and a good value if the light works for you. We sent ours back for a Conair that will take standard incandescent bulbs (night light size) that we use in place of the colored original ones."
5,Perfect,"This is a must have for those with problems with site, and great for everyday use, two thumbs up! Great"
3,just ok,The mirror itself is nice but the quality of the product seems minimal. It is wobbly and doesn't close nicely. I had an older model that gave out that was well made so ordered the same brand but just doesn't seem as well made. Works for what I need it for and the outlet on it is very convenient as well.
1,I should have listened to the naysayers,Worked fine for the first two days then I had to hold the switch down a little longer each day for it to light. Ultimately it stopped lighting completely within 2 weeks. Returned for credit and Amazon was great as usual!
4,works for me,"Ive had this type of mirror before in the past it is normal to have to hold the on button for a total of 3 seconds (do three mississippi's) The different types of lighting are great. The magnification side terrific for the eyebrows, makes for flawless makeup application as well. I'll take this mirror any day over the bright little round ones u find in the store now. I gave this 4 stars because im not sure i totally agree with the light represented by this mirror, but use your common sense ladies if you open your compact in the office and you look like your in home lighting, use the home light setting when putting on your make up for work :-)"
1,Unsatisfactory In Every Way,"After reading some of the positive comments about this mirror, I was excited to have found it. The excitement went away, however, once I tried to use it. The plug kept tripping the outlet off and it's somewhat awkward getting it to light up. The bulbs flicker for a bit before they stay lighted. Also, the magnification mirror on the flip side is not large enough for a 5x magnification. I wasn't happy with this mirror at all and am returning it for a refund. Wish I had never bought it."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I bought 2 mirrors, one for each of my teenage daughters. They both love them and so do I. I will be ordering another one for myself and one for my sister. There have been no issues with the light needing to warm up. These are fantastic for make-up, eyebrow shaping, and for bedroom use instead of messy counters in the bathroom. It is true that this is the mirror that gives you true lighting and magnification yet makes you look like a model instead of the mirrors that cause you to feel bad about yourself. I am so glad I ordered this on Amazon and did not just pick up one at the store because I would have been disappointed. Fast delivery and one of my daughters favorite Christmas presents. It has also saved me money on professional facial waxing because I can see so perfectly."
4,Good Product,So far so good. I am able to see to apply my make up. Haven't used it too much but it's as descibed and does the job. Would recommend.
5,5x Magnification is great!,Love this mirror! Nice that is has an extra outlet available - very handy. The 5x magnification is nice to have too! Turns on instantly and shifts smoothly for different lighting.
5,so good!!!!!,"i love this mirror i bought this a year ago and its perfect for travel, i can use like a lamp whit the dimer set everything its perfect on it ,thanks."
1,Mirror lasted less than 6 months,I've had these types of mirrors in the past and they lasted for Years! This Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror only lasted 4 months before the lights went out! This is the worst brand ever for tri-fold lighted mirrors. Do Not By this Mirror!
1,makeup mirror,"Very disapointed in this Jerdon Tri-fold lighted mirrow. Worked fine for about 2 months, then all lights are not working!!"
2,Would be nice if it worked,"After having a makeup mirror for 40 years. The same one! It no longer would switch to a different lighting. So I ordered this one. It was important to me that the mirror would swing top to bottom, and this one did. But when I got it, it too was broken exactly like my old old mirror. The company told me to just throw it away and they refunded me my money. Don't know if this is a normal operational problem, but I never had a chance to try it out. I took my old one apart and worked on it, and got it working again. Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without! I really don't live by that much, but it worked this time."
2,"Will do, but not perfect.","I think this mirror is great for it's magnification qualities, but it does fall short in the brightness of the light. I thought I could use the light without having my bright bathroom lights on but that is not the case. If you are looking for a mirror with a bright light this is not the one for you."
2,Disappointed,I was setting up the mirror to put on my makeup and the piece that holds the stand up broke off into pieces so now I have to prop the mirror up in order to see into it. I think the material is very cheap. This should not have happened. Now I have to go and research another mirror other than this one!
1,Jerdon Lighted Mirror,"I ordered this lighted make-up mirror at the end of May 2010. Both lights blew out at the same time at the end of Dec. 2010. The product was great while it worked, but not worth the money to have only lasted 6 months. The maker of this product won't allow the buyer to change light bulbs, so the item had to be thrown away. Why would I pay an electrician to install light $7.00 light bulbs. I would not recommend this product because there is a definite flaw in this product."
2,It's just ok,"I bought this mirror for when I go away and there's not alot of light in a hotel room to apply makeup. I needed something very close with alot of light. I find that although this light is adequate I would have preferred even more light. The different shades of light that are suppose to simulate day, night, etc. also to me aren't accurate. Perhaps this light is adequate for someone else who doesnt require as much light, but for someone who requires a very well lit up area it's just ok."
2,Not bright enough to be useful; side mirrors don't hold position,"I was disappointed in this product, after reading reviews from others who liked it. The lights are not bright enough, and the colored filters make them less so (as well as seeming like...well, just weird colors. Furthermore, the side mirrors don't want to stay in position; they just flop open."
1,Junk Just As The Other Buyers Said,"At 1st I thought this mirror was kinda nice. Not as lighted as I need but better than what I had previously. Set it up at my boyfriends for whom I only visit on the weekends. 2nd weekend, lights just shut off and there is no fancy way to get them to go back on. No holding the switch or any of the other bologna posted on the reviews for which I thoroughly read and based my decision on when I made the purchase. My boyfriend who is an electrician tested the outlet where the curling iron can be plugged in and yes there was power to it. Switch tested fine, Lamps just quit and no way of changing them without sending it in to the manufacturer according to the manual. What crap. Less than 3 uses and this thing is junk and of course I wanted to return it to amazon but I'm a few days too late so I'm stuck eating the cost. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK. I'm really tired of mail order crap."
2,okay,I was disappointed int he size of the viewing mirror and you can't close the two side doors without turning the mirror over. All in all I would not recommend.
5,Love it!,"I love this mirror. Two things I love about it (that my old one did not have)......it has an adjustable stand so you can tilt it where you want it and it stays put (I had to use my old one on a rubber mat to hold it in place, ugh), and this one has a plug in the front so you can plug in your hair dryer or curling iron......really helpful. Plus the mirror is nice and it looks nice sitting on the counter. I like the different light adjustments also. Really a nice product."
5,Great Product,"It is very hard to find a make-up mirror that has an outlet on it, it makes it nice to be able to plug in your curling iron. You can not find this product in the stores anywhere. Very nicely packed, fast shipping. Thank You!"
4,great make up mirror,"Good magnification, good lighting and tone range, complete view of face and hair with fold out side mirrors. Bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it."
1,Not a good product!,"I got this make-up mirror last year for Christmas. The bulbs have since burned out and there is no way to replace them with new ones! If that's what you want in a make-up mirror, go for it. Otherwise, steer clear!"
3,Not what I expected!,"I read all the product reviews before I purchased this mirror but couldn't believe the negative comments about the lighting could be as bad as some said. Several said it was fine. After trying to use mine, I agree that the lighting is horrible. I am not impressed with the lack of light and still be listed as ""LIGHTED"". The bulbs create such a small amount of light, regardless of the setting used, that I just don't use the light at all. Very disappointed. Would rather have light!"
4,Awesome!,"After reading a ton of reviews on different mirrors, I decided to go with this one. I'm glad I did! It's definitely brighter than my other mirror I got from Revlon. I can use it with very little lighting in the room. The only thing I don't like is the different color selections for the lighting - I haven't really found it useful. Other than that, it's a good mirror."
5,Love My Mirror,"My eyes have gotten so bad, I couldn't see to put on my make-up on well at all. I didnt want these new mirrors that are out. I'm from the old school. and use to have one of these kind of mirrors and I knew they worked. Use one in my High school days the 80's when we wore lots of make-up. No I dont use that much now! lol! I was so happy when I found this one and that they still made them!! It works so great., even my mom, who lives with us uses it. I'm gonna get her one for her birthday!"
4,Jerdon Mirror,"It's a pretty good mirror. I don't like the look of it really, and it sounds like a bug zapper when you turn it on, but it works."
1,Jerdon Make-up Mirror,Not worth the money - the mirror distorts your image depending on how close/far you are to it and is not large enough to frame ones whole face. The side panels are useless - if you use them to see the side of your face you can't put your make-up on as they get in the way. I bought this because I had a conair and couldn't find replacement bulbs - I am going to look harder for those bulbs now.
1,"Don't waste your money, the bulbs don't last a week","Had it for a week, used it THREE times...after that the lights won't go on. I completely understand how to operate the on/off, it's not that, the bulbs literally fail after just a few uses just like most of the other customer feedback say they do. It WILL be complicated if you try to replace the bulbs. It's not just open it up with a philips screwdriver and replace them with bulbs bought at the local hardware shop, nope. One review says an electrician is required. I don't know, I'm not going to try and incur more costs than I'm already in for. I just know that I can't do it myself."
3,Good mirror.,I found this mirror to be good for now. Center mirror seems a bit blury while the side mirrors were fine. The lighting is not adequate enough. I will keep looking for something better. The shipping was quick.
2,Poor light and mirror!,"Listen to the negative reviews and don't purchase this mirror. I want to replace a very old and beaten-up Remington mirror that is terrible looking but still works like a champ (but isn't made anymore, sadly), so I ordered this mirror hoping I would side with the positive reviews. I only had to plug it in once to see that it doesn't emit half the light of the one I am replacing, and the magnifying mirror is unclear and distorted compared to the Remington. I am over 50 and my vision is getting a lot worse, and this mirror does nothing to help me see my face more clearly; there are only disadvantages to its use. It appears cheaply made and there's no way to hang it on the wall, either. Terribly disappointed, and frustrated too. This mirror is being returned! It was manufactured to resemble my old one, but is nothing but a cheap imitation."
2,Not so much,I bought this product less than a year ago. One light has almost went out and the other is weak. I tried holding down the on/off button. No work for me. Not a good deal at all. At this point I really don't know one that is. I just need a lighted mirror that is going to last longer and work better than this one did.
1,Don't buy this!,About one month after receiving this as a gift the lights completely stopped working. Don't waste your money on this!!!
1,You've got to be kidding me!,"Bought the Jerdon Classic JGL9W Lighted Tri-fold Mirror for my daughter for Christmas 2010. It worked well for about a year, and has been spotty since early spring 2012. Now the lights only come on sporadically, and only if you spin the mirror, jump up and down, clap your hands and pray. Then, if we're lucky, the lights MIGHT grace us with their so-called presence. It's so pathetic that Amazon knows that half of these mirrors are defective (I mean, have they actually READ the reviews???) and yet they still sell them. If they wanted to make some money, they could make the lights replaceable and sell the bulbs.Of course, my Amazon warranty was only good for 30 days, and the Jerdon warranty for 1 year, so I'm SOL. Fun stuff."
2,disappointment,"I bought this mirror just over 1 year ago and both bulbs are now out. It wasn't bright enough for me to begin with, but now it is going in the trash, since I need a lighted mirror. I've tried holding down the 'on' button as other reviewers have advised. I'm not sure how that would make a difference, since it is a toggle switch, but I gave it a try - no luck."
2,not the greatest,"I've had this mirror for a few months now and I'm just not really happy with it. The light is absolutely not bright enough. I had to take a desk lamp and set it up behind the mirror shining directly at me from above the mirror. Now, I don't have any room on my vanity for makeup."
5,Excellent service,"The description of the item was exactly as described, service was excellent. Item was shipped immediately, arrived without damage. Was most defineltly impressed.thanks,Roger"
3,unstable,This mirror tends to fall out of it's adjustable support. I have had to put a sheet of rubber under the support in order to keep it from collapsing.
3,It was not working properly,"I love the mirror, but the lighting button came in broken, I think it is too fragile. For the mean time it works for its purpose and for the price it is good, but I cant change the light setting."
3,kinda small,"this mirror is what the seller said it is, but it is too small for my purposes. My hair is long and I wanted a mirror to do my hair in. This mirror is good for makeup application but not for doing long hair."
4,Great Mirror for the Price!,Nice large mirrors. Variety of light choices with just the right magnification.Great price! I would recommend this for the price!
5,Works great for me!,"Don't let the good doc scare you off. His wife may have gotten a lemon, but I've used mine daily for several months now, even dropped it once, and it has performed beautifully. Good make-up mirror at a great price!"
1,Wished I had read these reviews before buying this piece of junk!,This mirror started flickering off and on just a few months after I bought it. It is only about 6 months old. The lights have gone off and on and now the lights have gone out for good!
1,The reviews are true..........,"I ignored the comments regarding this product about the bulbs burning out. I figured that having done 10 years in electronic assembly that was something I could deal with if need be, WRONG! My bulbs burned out after little more than a year and there is no way I can see to open the case so you can replace the bulbs, without breaking something. I'm giving up and looking for a Conair product that I should get a good five years out of."
2,Lights burn out,I purchased this item in Oct 2010. By Nov 2011 the lights have blown and are not replaceable. This is a non serviceable item. The lights cannot be replaced. I threw away nearly $40 on something I expected to last more than one year. Conveniently the warranty is only for one year. I am very disapointed with this particular product.
1,Birthday Dud,The mirror looked fine but the light switch wouldn't even turn on.Very disappointed as this was sent as a birthday gift and had to be returned. I would not try this brand again - it didn't even rate 1 star. The only good part of the whole deal was Amazon's painless return policy and process.
2,Defective+,"This item came to be defective in that only three of the four settings worked; the ""day"" setting would not. Also, the back of the item has a long plastic piece that you use to place the item up or tilted back. This negates the ability to push the mirror back on the dresser; it sticks way out."
2,"Serviceable item, but defective","I bought this mirror because reviewers loved it. Minus a few lightbulb defficiencies that did not worry me. I setup the mirror and when I moved the lever at the bottom to change the light settings it moved without difficulty or resitance - because it was broken! The lightbulb lighting does not change, it's stuck at a pink color. I am returning this item and will not buy it again. The plastic feels cheap, but the mirror looks good. If you're looking for a good mirror and do not care about the overall feel of the product or maybe getting a defective one, then this would be a good purchase for the price."
1,"First Time I used it worked fine, 2nd time , would not even Turn on !!","This Makeup Mirror worked ONE TIME ONLY.. I had this same model Before, and it lasted about 3 -4 years,..The New one I just Purchaced Broke (would not turn on) after the First use.. Sandy, Beaumont, Texas ( P.S. I am ordering a Conair !!)"
4,I like it a lot,"This mirror does make your skin tone strange colors when used, but it has been great for me! I get a good idea of when my makeup will look like in dif lighting. My coverage has been great since I got this."
1,Do noy buy!,"I should have taken the advice posted here. After eight months of use, the bulbs flickered, then went dead."
3,Lighted Makeup Mirror,"I purchased this to replace a similar lighted makeup mirror I owned for about 20 years, a side bulb burned out. With this Jerdon product, I like the easy on and off button and the ease of selecting the proper lighting for the occasion. However my old mirror had a heavy bottom and the mirror stayed in place on my dresser. This new mirror has a really light bottom and doesn't stay put. I am forever sliding the entire mirror around so that the placement is correct for me to see myself. It is not the mirror in the middle I am having trouble with, it stays however it is positioned. The problem is with the entire mirror not staying put. It is annoying but I am getting accustomed to it. Otherwise the product is good and very much like my old mirror. I wear bifocals and can see perfectly."
1,Don't buy it,The lever for changing the light filters was very hard to move. It was so still that the lever's handle fell off in my hand. Returned this item for credit.
4,Jerdon Lighted Mirror is fine,"Have only had it for about a month, but everything works fine. Don't have to hold down the light switch an unusually long time. Close match to the Clairol mirror I had for so long. Electrical outlet on the front is convenient for using a hair dryer."
2,Mixed feelings,"I was initially very pleased with this mirror BUT after only owning the mirror for 7 months, the lights stopped working! The lights can not be replaced by the customer. Now I'm stuck with a product that doesn't fill my need. Not happy at all because now I have to buy a new mirror!!!"
1,I would never recommend this mirror,I have bought two of these mirrors within the last year and have wound up throwing them both in the trash! The bulbs or the switch (or both) goes out in about two months. You cannot replace the bulbs and it just isn't worth the trouble to send it back to the manufacturer for repair. Bad product!!!
1,Read Carefully,"I am an avid reader of reviews before I buy products from any website especially Amazon. They are usually informative and helpful. That being said after reading reviews for this product I decided to purchase it. This was a christmas gift for my girlfriend so I expected it to work. It didn't. The lights wouldn't turn on at all. I was quite surprised so I went back and started reading reviews again. I noticed by default Amazon pulls up ""the most helpful"" reviews...not the newest. When sorting by the ""newest"" reviews first I found out I'm not the only one that received a faulty unit. Apparently the quality has really went down hill so my suggestion to you is when purchasing any product from Amazon make sure to read the newest reviews first. A great review from 5 years ago doesnt necessarily translate into a good product today. Shame on you Amazon."
2,Disappointing,"I am disappointed that after less than a year the lights do not work, and changing them is ridiculously difficult. The product is useless without the lights."
5,Good product,"I too, read the reviews and almost didn't purchase this, I bought the Conair Illunimation and HATED the Conair, returned it and got this Jerdon. The light is bright, not 4 skimpy bulbs like the conair, I like the on-off switch and the plug is an added plus. Trust me, I have had a make-up mirror for 40 years and this is is a good buy. Got the product within a couple of days from Amazon, packed well. I am totally satisfied."
2,Not for me.,I was disappointed by this item. The bulbs were not bright enough for my needs. Too late to send it back.
1,Mirrors poor quality on magnification side,I was really dissappointed with the performance of the magnifying mirror. The images are distorted to the point of causing headache. The other mirrors were fine.
2,"Disappointed, not the same tried and true!","I was excited to find this mirror, which appears almost identical to my ancient Remington brand mirror that gave up the ghost after 20 years of daily use. Unfortunately it is very different: the lighting is signficantly dimmer, the daytime light setting is quite ""pink"" (akin to the ""evening"" setting on my old mirror), and the magnified side is concave shaped and distorting. My old Remington, even without lighting, is vastly superior to this model, which I will be returning promptly. This is another case of much lower quality standards where they don't make them like they used to!"
3,Jerdon Lighted Mirror,"This lighted mirror is ok. The lighting is kind of dull and could be better. What I really like best about the lighted mirror is the electrical plug on the front, which is great for plugging in a hair dryer or curling iron."
1,Does Not Light Up,"I should have heeded other reviews regarding the failure of the mirror to light-up. When I first turned it on it didn't light up; I left it in the ""on"" position. After about 45 minutes, it lit up. After that for about two days, it worked, lighting immediately upon turning on the switch. Day 3 - would not light up no matter how long I left it on. Has not lit up since. Very disappointed because returning items purchased on-line is such a hassle."
4,Pretty good,"The lighting is good, but you need to get very close to the magnifying mirror for it to be good. I like that there are different settings for the light."
2,not too happy,This product arrived on time but it was a poor quality item. We had to return it because the tab used to move the lighting settings came apart the first time we tried it. Not worth your time; the oveall quality of the material was poor.
4,Light Mirro,"Very good mirror. I wish the light was brighter. But it seem to be the brightest mirror out there. The Magnification mirror is great, can't wear my glasses to put make up on & with the magnification mirror I can see well enough to put make up on. The mirror arrived quickly & in good condition."
2,so/so,"The different light settings are a nice feature. Some of the time though, the light doesn't go on, and I didn't realize I'd have to have an experienced electrician replace the bulbs once they die, which obviously isn't very practical."
3,Jerdon 5X Lighted Mirror,"Light settings really don't change the lights much.Larger than I thought it would be, but it's ok for the price."
3,no bright enough,"It is decently built but the lighting is not as bright as I would have desired. I have to add couple more lights, to make it better. Don' t want to return it but not truly satisfied with it. Will not buy it again."
4,Great mirror!,I have wanted a makeup mirror for a while but no idea what kind. This is great for me. Several light changes to choose from. It is just nice to stay seated and not have to stand and get closer to the mirror. It works great and has everything that I wanted.
4,Jerdon JGL9W 5X Magnification Tri-fold Lighted Mirror,"I have only had this product for one month, but read reviews that were negative and positive. I have had a very positive experience with this mirror so far. The light works perfect. It comes on immediately after pressing the on button. The magnified mirror is perfect. As with all magnification mirrors, you do have to get somewhat close, but not too close. It all depends on your eyes. For the money, the mirror has alot to offer. It has many different angles and the side mirrors are a plus for making sure my foundation completely covers the side of my face and that my eyeshadow is not too far over my eyelids (out past the corners)."
3,review for Jerdon JGL9W Mirror,"I think that this product is okay. The lights on the product are too small and therefore it does not have the ability to give off enough light that one needs to do there make-up. The magnification of the mirror is fine and the different selections for the type of light, such as day, office or night is great. But the only flaw that I find is the lights itself on the sides they are not bright enough."
4,Argument saver!,"Great! Saves""your in my way""arguments. My wife loves it, and so do I!(well, cause she does). The only that would make it better is to have a clock in it! :)"
4,Good for a small desk.,All in all I like the product. It works well for what I need. The light is not as bright as I think I would like it to be.. But keeping it on the day setting dose the trick. Worth the money. Shipped fast and came in great shape. Thank you Amazon!
2,Blew light bulb,"Nice little mirror till one of the bulbs blew, had it only about 3 months. This was a gift and I was disappointed for sure."
1,"Lights stop working, can't replace them.","I used to have a similar mirror to this by a different maker that lasted decades. Then I tried this Jerdon model and liked the lighting and magnified mirror even better, but after 2 short years, the bulbs will no longer light. I'm sure it's not the bulbs, but rather the ballast. You can't get parts for it, though, so now it's going to Starvation Army or someplace like that. Fortunately, there are a couple of similar mirrors on the market by other makers. I'll try one of those next. I wouldn't buy a Jerdon again unless it were the only lighted vanity mirror of this style. Even then, I'd think hard about it. Other reviewers didn't get even 1 year before the lights went dark, so it seems to be a real crapshoot. Two years might be the max, and that only if you're lucky.Got to go check out that Conair version now."
2,Ver poor light,"I would recommend that you heed the other reviews that complain about the lack of good lighting with this mirror. I had a Remington and I broke the mirror. The Remington is no longer available, so purchased this as a replacement. I liked the idea of the fluorescent bulbs, and was used to holding the button for a bit for them to warm up as I had to do that with the Remington. The light is so poor -for me anyway and compared to what I was used to.I would not recommend this product."
2,Lights bulb problems too!,"I also have this mirror with light bulb problems. I have the paperwork that came with it and there is a section about replacement bulbs. It says not to attempt to change it but to ""send us your mirror and we will service it for you"". Does anyone have any idea where to send it to??"
4,tight,"A colleague of mine just dropped this album on my desk. The descriptive word that keeps popping into my head is ""fresh"". It's not your ordinary recycled modern jazz album. Just a great listen. Towards the end of the disc Mr. Blue hit a run of notes that just rocked me. Fun stuff, check it out..."
5,A Story Worth Telling and Exceedingly Well-Told,"Louis Rehr's historical depiction of the B-26's role in the ETO of WW II is wonderful. I'm biased in my observations because James E. Womeldorff, the ExO of the 323 Bomb Group, kindly acknowledged by Louis in his memoirs, is my father-in-law. Jim was one of the best men I have had the pleasure of knowing in my life. This book should be required reading for all students studying the history of the U. S.Michael B. MillerLittle Rock, Arkansas"
5,Caution: Book causes drooling,I only let myself look at 10 bowl photos a night so I can stretch out the experience of enjoying this book for a long time. It is so inspirational to me as a potter and a lover of the creative ceramics of others.
5,"Another ""500 Series"" Success!",They've done it again! 500 Bowls is another expertly curated collection from the Lark 500 series. Highly recommend this along with all the other 500 series books for every artist and especially ceramicists. Wonderfully presented visual survey of what's going on in the world of contemporary ceramics. Really a pleasure to look through over and over again. I just keep coming back to these books!
2,A Big Disappointment,"This book is so much less than it could have been. While a lot of the pieces are wonderful, many are uninteresting and unskillful. With 500 photos, SO MUCH has been left out, especially the work of the exceptional ""functional potters"" who may be ubiquitous but many of whom still produce beautiful work. The emphasis in this book is on the decorative piece that goes on a shelf. In addition facing pictures often detract from one another, another statement of poor choices."
1,"Disappointing, but here's another recommendation","This book follows the current trend in ceramics which says if it isn't ""far out "" , misshapen, weird, and/or ugly it isn't ""in"". A lot of these pieces are not even recognizable as bowls. If you want a really great book of bowls that look like bowls and yet are not ordiinary, get 500 Wooden Bowls. Many of the designs will translate very well to clay"
5,Tsubasa Buy Review,I love this series! It was a great buy. Very easy to buy from with no hassel at all.
2,One Clamp manga is enough,"If you read a ton of clamp, the storylines become annoyingly similar after awhile. I decided to give Tsubasa a shot because I enjoyed Cardcaptor Sakura so much. I was very surprised that the storyline, though similar to CCS, was a NEW story! But then, much to my disappointment, characters from all of Clamp's other mangas were referenced to in almost every scene. I enjoy the story, I really do, but it irritates me how Clamp is using Tsubasa as an advertisement for their other mangas. The story is cluttered up with cameos and similar scenes. I took a chance and am generally happy, but if you haven't read Clamp before (and only if you haven't) you will enjoy this manga. However, I have found, that one Clamp manga in your collection is plenty as the stories merge, so choose carefully which series you will buy. Ciao!PS don't read the other reviews of the other volumes if you want the manga to be a surprise. Those reviewers don't care that they are spoiling the entire series!"
5,Not your regular use...,"I purchased two of the 48-inch length for something other than what they are made for. I am certainly not a climber, however I do find myself suspending mass with rope. These have performed beautifully and hold up extremely well. I haven't had any issue with fraying nor have the ever had the slightest ""give"". They get a lot of use and I am very confident in them. And they are one of the highest rated slings, 25kN. My only complaint is that you cannot choose the color specifically. However, I received a blue and yellow one and they are both very attractive. I recommend these highly. Love them!"
5,Not an optomistic view of Russia,"The author tells Stalin's story in a more cohesive way (that is it is easier to follow) than Simon Montefire in ""Stalin: the court of the Red Tsar"" (Simon's book, however, is richer in detail). And in the end Donald Rayfield is much more clear about which way, he thinks, Russia is going. Russia is moving back to something like the Soviet Union (but smaller thankfully). The FSB is now acting like the KGB and brutal Stalinist methods are being used in Chechnaya.The overall impression I got from reading this book was that Stalin was so powerful and he ruled for so long that he imprinted his DNA on Russia's famous Soul."
4,"Interfaces that are worth the ""Hand""","I read this book after Bret Victor's allusion to it in his rant against Microsoft's vision of touch screens [...] ). The book does challenge one's estimate of ""hand"", its design (and the Designer). As I am waiting for carpal tunnel syndrome diagnostics for my right hand, I wish we can come up with better interfaces than mouse, keyboard and touch screens."
3,Memories from my childhood,"For memories sake, it's a 5 star rating. The book itself was in worse condition than I thought, especially for the price. But I'm glad I have this bit of my childhood with me now as I've thought of it over the years, especially on rainy days!"
1,TRIPPLITE PowerVerter 375 DC to AC Power Inverter 230 Volts Tripp Lite,What I ordered was a 230V inverter. They delivered a 110V which is not useful in Ghana. i have to look for a step up transformer(extra cost).
4,A great autograph piece,"Wow, Better than I expected. I bought it to take to an autograph show to have the guest sign, and was pleasantly surprised when I got it. A great piece, that with a little extra doctoring up looks like a proffesional piece. Very happy with the whole purchase."
3,"An acceptable pocket dictionary, though I rather prefer the Collins","The OXFORD FRENCH MINI DICTIONARY is one of the most popular pocket dictionaries for French on the market. It contains 40,000 words and phrases, about the same as other options, but its strong points are the little phrase book in between the French-English and English-French sections, and the substantial guide to French verbs at the end. It also gives definitions of terms unique to French culture, like ""grand ecole"" and ""Rentre"". The pronunciation of each French listing is given in International Phonetic Alphabet transcription. I must say, though, that in terms of paper and binding, as well as layout, I prefer theCollins Gemdictionaries.The OXFORD FRENCH MINI DICTIONARY is suitable for classroom use or--as it weighs very little--tourism. However, it doesn't suffice for reading even a fairly ordinary long text in French. For reading books, you should invest in a desk dictionary as well."
4,Excellent source for historical data!,"I was looking for a Bible that gave reference to the facts and lifestyles of the days when the Books were penned, and that is exactly what the Archeological Study Bible offers. I've found it to be a valuable resource when I wanted to better understand why/how a particular passage was significant to the people of that day.I have particularly found the references and inclusions in the Books of the Apostle Paul to be very interesting and informative. We get a completely new understanding of who Paul was and why his impact on the Christian Faith was so immediate and long lasting.I only gave it 4-stars, as I would like to see even more archeological evidence included, but I highly recommend it!!D"
5,Absolutely amazing,This bible is absolutely amazing. I am reading the bible for the first time this year and I'm using this bible as a resource and addition to the others I'm reading. It has beautiful illustrations and is very well put together. I would highly recommend this bible to anyone!!!
5,This is my favorite study Bible,"I love the vibrant colors in this books with pictures of the ancient lands and how they look now. Filled with interesting maps, information, and artifacts, I can loose myself in this Bible forever. I would highly recommend this Bible as a gift for someone who enjoys reading Gods word and learning more about the history that surrounds it the facts and the artifacts!"
5,great study aide,"What a handy book/bible. Having an interest in archaeology and after visiting the holy land, I find this edition very helpful in reminding me of things I saw there and their relation to the texts."
2,poor digital transfer,This is a very poor digital transfer. It widows headings in such a way that is very confusing. It would have been better to try to link the study articles rather than leave them in the same place as in the print version. The timelines and other images cannot be enlarged and this makes them practically useless on the Kindle Fire.
2,Archeological Bible,"Having met Dr. Kaiser in person and having read several of his books, I find the Kindle version of this book disappointing. There is simply too much information and too many graphics to work well on a Kindle Fire. I will look at it in other formats, but the Kindle version, not so good."
3,Bible text chosen not the best one,"I would preferred if the text chosen was not the NIV. The publishers could have used other translation of the Bible for this work. The NIV is a paraphrased Bible, therefore, it is not the best choice for a study Bible. The study notes are mostly a synoptic view of the ancient world of the Old Testament and New Testament. I give 3 stars because of NIV text."
5,Best value in Kindle Bibles,"In short, I have a hardback of this study Bible in my office as well as the Kindle version. This first-class study Bible will run you $30 on up on a physical copy. I wouldn't hurt to have both but for only $2.99 you cannot go wrong. It's possibly the best value in Bibles in the Kindle store. You get all the content of the physical version. You have nothing to lose!"
5,Excellent for Geography as Well as Archaeology,"I read this entire Bible over a two-year period and it was really great. With very few exceptions, the articles were marvelous and the notes accurate. If you enjoy biblical geography (not just archaeology), you'll enjoy this Bible.I don't have a Kindle, but I do have a Kindle Reader for my iPad. I bought the $4 version and it's worth it. A little clunky to navigate, but it's nice that all biblical references and articles are hyper-linked."
4,A Little disappointed in the electronic version,"I have this book in hard-copy and it's a wonderful reference source(wish it came in NAS). As with any archeological information, you have to choose what is pertinent, but the author does a very good job of trying to present all views while preserving the true Christian viewpoint. Overall, I recommend this very inclusive book for anyone who wants to understand more of a background to scripture. I wanted the electronic copy to read at the beach, but it just wasn't versitile enough. It's the kind of book that you flip back-and-forth quite a bit and read the footnotes as you go through the information. So the electronic version wasn't very practical. I had looked forward to just carrying the Kindle because the hardcopy is so heavy. I recommend the hard-copy for any serious student of scripture."
4,Good information but very hard to read.,"Archaeological Study Bible: An Illustrated Walk Through Biblical History and CultureThis study Bible offers a good background study of the culture and historical locations. A good addition to my library. However, the print is so small that I have to use a magnifying glass to read it and that is annoying. Assuming it was published in large print, that would definitely the way to go."
4,Archaelogical Study Bible,"My daughter had specifically requested this for Christmas. Ever time she opens it,she finds something new and exciting. She is contemplating purchasing this particular bible for her boyfriend for his birthday."
3,Let it Air out!,"The bible is always a good choice. Only problem with this one is the fumes coming from this particular leather. I chose it because I wanted a sturdy bible and loved the colors and wanted the Archaeological bible added to my collection. However, Word to the Wise...place it outside so it can air out all of the fumes from the leather and inside the pages. The pages were stuck together hard to turn pages which signifies it was definitely...NEW!!!! I have allergies so it was a problem for me. May not be so bad for others!"
2,Glossy but disappointing,"I had hoped that this would take the place of my other bibles, but there are not many footnotes but the archeological material seems almost like those glossy parts of student bibles where you get maps and pictures of coins and modified men in bathrobes pretending to be apostles. So I use other texts."
4,Archaeological Study Bible makes Biblical Scholarship available to the layman,"For perhaps the first time, the Archaeological Study Bible makes discoveries in the field of Biblical Archeology available to the average Bible student. The in depth articles bring life to the historical contexts in which many Biblical stories take place. The custom maps and photos of various artifacts vividly illustrate study material.The only disappointment is the CD included with the Bible. Rather than the interactive software one would hope for from such a quality resource, the CD essentially only contains photos of artifacts seen in the Archaeological Study Bible.However, even with this minor disappointment, the Archaeological Study Bible is a tremendous resource for any serious student of the Bible."
5,A great find,"For me this is a great find. I have this Bible in hard cover. I put many page turns and penciled in words in my Bible. The HC didn't handle my use we'll, but I love the extra helps and info in this Bible. With the Kindle version I can comfortably make easy to review notes. Now I am looking for a easy to read Bible history book."
5,Awesome,"This is an awesome Bible. It has so many interesting details, but still not enough- but then I would have an even harder time reading the actual Scripture. I am really glad I own it."
5,A wonderful Bible,There are so many archaeological findings from the people and places the Bible speaks of that it makes the stories come so alive. It's awesome to share those facts with unbelievers who look at the Bible as a fiction book. There is a lot of evidence in these pages to proved reality.
3,Good but,This Bible is great for some information but falls short in the reference area. I still like it and do not regret the purchase at all.
5,EXCELLENT,My purchase was exactly what I wanted and arrived in excellent condition. The pricing was much better than in area stores as I did comparison pricing before I purchased it.
3,"Cool Information, Distinct Odor","Other reviewers have noted the basic pros and cons of this edition. I would echo many of those concerns. It's big, it's heavy, the type is small, etc. But information is great! I am really enjoying incorporating it into our Bible lessons for homeschool.But my main problem is the odor. I don't know if it is the kind of paper or ink Zondervan used or what, but this Bible has a very distinct smell -- and its not real pleasant. I can only stand to use it in small increments of time.I'll probably keep this on the shelf for reference, but still stick with my old trusty NIV study Bible for every day use and for Sundays."
3,frustrated,"Looking inside of this book seemed misleading. There is a LOT of info on the pages, and because the pages are brown on cream it just seemed to make it very hard for me to see...and the footnotes were even harder! Good thing I bought it for my teenager with very good eyes! Otherwise, she's happy--she really liked the cd that came with it, too!"
2,Study Bible,Hard to get through. I have yet to be able to find the table of contents. You can't just go to a particular scripture or page.
4,Archaeological study bible.,"Haven't gotten too far in my reading, but I am really enjoying it. I enjoy reading a little of how things were done at that time."
5,GOD BLESS YOU,It 'a well-detailed and thorough. I recommend it to all the people who harbor a strong interest on both the biblical sources that the 'archeology.May God bless the lives of anyone who read his word so that He can reveal to their hearts.
5,Great resource to your biblical library,"Keep in mind that this review is written by a man who doesn't care for the NIV translation. However, I found that: the history, archaeological facts, maps, archaeological photographs (almost 500), NIV translation, and cultural background make this a logical addition to my resource library. The book I have comes with a CD that includes the NIV translation, photographs and maps (I haven't looked at it yet). But even if this bible didn't come with a CD it would be well worth the money I paid for it. I wouldn't say it's as comprehensive as: a bible handbook, manners and customs reference, bible atlas, or concordance. However, it does have aspects of those resources in one volume. I feel this is a solid reference text that should be supported with other reference materials. And if your partial to the NIV translation this is solid choice for a study bible in my humble opinion. God Bless You."
1,Not on Kindle,"After reading most reviews I decided to try this and wanted to install it on our recently purchased Kindle Fire...Downloaded fine and I set out to explore.However, impossible to navigate; contents is only a button that opens bookmarks; no list of Biblical books, subj's, or concordance. It's like trying to read a highway paper map with blindfolds... Content may be great in the hardbound version but if I can't find anything it's useless. I think I'll stick with the bound copies and delete this from my library."
4,Well Pleased,"Most definitely not an upper end product, however it exceeded all of my expectations. A well designed product that meets the needs of a amateur film maker."
2,"Not sure if operating right, sound comes and goes in one channel?","Could be my rookieness, but I hear good sound in one side of channel, and other side its coming in and out. When I upload to a video site, I only hear sound on one side. Doesn't matter if I use their mic or my stereo lapel mike.The handheld is noisy... just put it in a stand and don't touch it."
4,a great mic for a great price.,"I've used this mic for a pilates classes for a film, and it has worked great. no real issues, long battery life, and light weight for the instructor. And for the price of this wireless mic you really cant beat it."
3,Did not come with Lavalier Microphone,Product advertised as containing both handheld and lavalier microphones. Only came with one. Disappointing! I bought it solely for that style of microphone.
1,Broke after a few minutes use,"I ordered the microphone system to use in a wedding and it arrived just in time. (within projected time of arrival). The box was opened and within a few minutes the system was up and operating, for about 5 minutes. While it worked great, after a few minutes I couldn't hear the transmissions from the earphone. I had to purchase a Sima (not as well designed) unit from Best Buy to use in the wedding. I contacted Amazon and was able to return the unit hassle free."
1,Had to return this product,I was using this for a PA system - didn't work at all for that purpose. It didn't pick up the voice when placed on the lapel at all. It had to be next to your mouth - which wasn't possible to set up. It also caused terrible feedback. I sent it back.
2,noisy noisy noisy,"Honestly, the amount of post work that I had to do drove me crazy. I expect to do a little work on audio, but if you don't own an editing program with a noise reducer, don't bother."
3,"Great value, but small interference issue",I found this Item to be a great value for the price. It's short range quality is perfect for studio work. The only problem I encountered is florescent bulbs and the new CFL bulbs cause major interference. I solved this problem by swapping out the energy saver bulbs for incandescent bulbs which generate a lot of heat.
4,Audio Technica ATR 288W,"Ok I bought this just for home and youtube video's and under the brentsfilms channel.It makes a couple sounds of static even if you are close to the camera. But you just have to find a spot where there is not much power around. Then it should do just fine. It is perfect for the money and Beach Camera is just the place to get it. Low price, Great customer service, and fast shipping.No longer than a week. Like I said for the money it's great!"
4,Excellent value,"This wireless mic system is a good value for the price. Sound quality is good over the range I've been using it, around 30-40 feet. My only complaint is that both the transmitter lacks a ""mute"" switch and the receiver ""chirps"" when the transmitter is powered off, so although this would not be much of an issue when used with a video camera, it's not ideal (but still acceptable) as an inexpensive wireless solution for use with a P.A."
5,Prentice Hall Grammar exercise woorkbook,The writing and grammar book was in perfect condition and came right away. Faster than expected which was great!
4,Darling little jewerly box for a little girl,"This box was just what I was looking for. I wanted a simple box that played a tune when opened and a ballerina to spin around. It was for my 3 1/2 year old, so I didn't want something too fancy, expensive, or complicated that she would break. This fits the bill. She LOVES it. It is actually very pretty and the little ballerina is on a spring so she has some nice movement as she spins."
2,ballerina jewelry box-pink,It was cute - but didn't last long. The dancing ballerina broke within days. Too much money for such a delicate childrens item.
1,Schylling Iridescent Ballerina Jewelry Box,"This product was a disappointment to me, and my granddaughter. It's not iridescent at all. The music is nice, but we were expecting something according to the description."
3,Jewelry Box,"The jewelry box was a nice gift for two sisters first ballet recital. It is not very sturdy and the key that turns the music on the back would come off. Later we found out that the girls were turning it the wrong way. Once they learn the proper way to turn it, it was OK. Nevertheless, it was the highlight of the party."
4,Ballerina Jewelry Box,I honestly would buy this product again if it's available.A must have for any little girl who can appreciate it. It issturdy and a nice storage for jewelry.
4,Jewelry Box,"I bought this for a 7 yr old little girl who was in the DHS system and one of her Christmas ""wishes"" was for a ballerina jewelry box. It was very cute, shipped right away!! My only concern was that the tiny dancer might have been too tiny - maybe easy to come apart - but overall a great little gift!! You couldn't find this in the stores that is for sure. Thank you so much for helping make her wish come true!!"
3,"Mirror Damaged, Check Your Return Date!","I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my 3-yo daughter. When she opened it I realized the silver paint on the sides of the mirror are all smudged and doesn't look great. Since it was around $12 (and she's happy with it) it was a low priority to contact seller for an exchange-- and now a month later getting around to it, I realize I'm too late. Check yours when it arrives!"
4,Jewelry Box,I ordered this as a birthday present for my little cousin. I am really happy with this Jewelry box it looked even better when I got it than it did on the computer.
3,Christmas gift for granddaughter,My granddaughter liked my music boxes when she visited my home so I purchased this one for her. I was a little dissapointed with the covering. I am looking forward to seeing her again soon and will be interested to see how the box is holding up. Maybe a little overpriced.
4,Great gift,A great gift for our 4 and 6 yr old granddaughters. The box was exactly what we expected. Very satisfied.
4,"Good, but . . . .","I got this clock for my 90 year old mother. If you are looking for a clock with big, easy-to-read numbers, this is your clock. If seeing the day and date is also important, then it is not. The date is usually off a day or two and the day and date are so small they are not easily read unless the viewer's vision is sharp."
1,Nonsense,"This book is not only intellectually dishonest, it is badly written and chock full of nonsense.Read it at your peril."
2,battery sucker,If you purchase this item remove the batteries after every use. Or be prepared to buy batteries for every use. It will suck them gone even when it is off.
1,Piece of garbage,Works fine if you only want a basic calculator but I need a calculator for algebra. Instead of a USB cord it came with a cable that doesn't hook up to any computer made in the last decade. Calculator was new but manufactured in 1991. Company refused any compensation or discussion.
5,TI-83,The calculator is in excellent condition - exactly what I ordered. Ordered on a Sunday and received on Thursday. Appreciate the service!
1,Beware of ordering & Amazon not delivering,"I ordered this item last week, and it should have been received today. However, it has never been shipped, and today I was notified by Amazon that shipment would be delayed until March 6th. This makes no sense, because the item is still being sold and the page states that ""there are 6 in stock"". Last week it said there were 14 in stock. Evidently, there are NONE in stock, or else Amazon simply does not want to ship one to me. I have cancelled my order, and be warned = if you are ordering this and want it anytime soon, don't bet on it. I gave this one star not because of the product but because they haven't sent me the product. For all I know (and expect) the product is fine."
2,Damaged during shipping,"Seems to be a somewhat common theme, based on some of the reviews. Two of the six dishes were damaged -- one shattered into three pieces, the other badly chipped and cracked. Started the Amazon return/replacement process in the hopes of getting the two damaged dishes replaced, but the only option available was a refund with a return of the entire order. I'll manage with four dishes (I really only needed four in the first place). If you're thinking about purchasing these (the Amazon seller was River Road when I bought them, which seems to have already changed, according to the product page), you should assume that the purchase price will give you less than six dishes."
4,I like these souffle set...but,"I only gave it 4 not 5 stars. I like these type souffle bowls so I ordered it. I like the long lasting quality to them. But having just used them as bowls and washed it 4x in the diswasher, I noticed that one already has a crack in it. Man, I bought these for baking french onion soup for Thanksgiving, but now I'm going to be short one due to a crack. I still like them and that's why I gave it 4 stars."
1,Broken Dishes = Hassle,"These looked like a great deal so I bought them. They arrived in a timely manner. Unfortunately, packaging was poor so one of the dishes was broken. I needed 6 of these, not 5. Now I must go through the hassle of returning them and getting a refund. Lots of wasted time and energy that amounts to absolutely nothing. Much better to go to a store and buy these than to buy from Amazon."
5,One of his best!,"This book is very fast-paced (I read it in one day) partially due to its short length of 246 pages and partly becauase of Laymons fluid writing style.The storyline is that someone sends annonymous invitations to teenagers from the local high school inviting them to attend a halloween party at an abandoned house where the family who lived there were slaughtered 15 years previously.Please do not be discouraged from this book by bad reviews, it is a fantastic novel and a great read which I recommed to all fans of Laymon. And if you have not yet read anything by Laymon (and trust me you are seriouly missing out if you havn't) this is as good a place to start as any."
2,A RARE DISAPPOINTMENT FROM DICK,"It's a shame that this was the first Laymon book John K read. No, this is not very good, in fact after attempting to reread it I found the prose amateurish and uninvolving. However Laymon wrote many wonderful books that simply demand to be reread. No doubt you all have your favorites. I particularly recommend:ONE RAINY NIGHT, RESURRECTION DREAMS (the first Laymon I ever read), COME OUT TONIGHT, DREADFUL TALES, NIGHT IN THE LONESOME OCTOBER, FLESH and BODY RIDES. So John, pick up one of these books and I guarantee you will be glued to your chair. Dick was (and still is) one of the best."
3,All Hallow's Eve doesn't hit the mark,"I did think a couple of parts were interesting though, where the kid's father, who was the killer in it committed a few murders with a hatchet and locked some of his son's classmates in the haunted house and murdered a few of them, encouraging his son to murder and rape some of the girls.One of the lead characters in it, a police officer was dating the boy's mother and by the end of the book you learn she was murdered too by the boy's father. The cop then begins having a relationship with a woman he met at the local motel in the course of his investigation into the murder of his superior officer. But besides that, the story was pretty weak."
4,Love It,"I have been a fan of Perfume for a while and was so excited to see this CD become available in the USA. The best song on this CD is ""Electro World"". The song sounds somewhat like the songComputer City. This was one of Perfume's earlier singles so their voices sound slightly different than in their later albums and singles. Overall I love it and hope to see more Perfume albums and singles become available in the USA!"
5,A Beautiful Reference for All Lovers of Beauty,"This book makes a fantastic reference books for any sort of romantic--artists, writers, musicians, nature-lovers, philosophers, and scientists. However, I need to make it clear that this is not an ART book. In this book, Eco's phenomenal critique on the history of Beauty through Western eyes is supported through references not only to painting and sculpture, but also philosophy writings, poetry, and even advertising.The colour plates are lovely and, even though this is a rather hefty book (especially in hardcover), it is a quick and enjoyable read.Makes a great gift for any artists, poets, or students."
5,Rich source of color illustrations,In the least this book is a rich source of color illustrations from a surprising array of time periods and collections. I found it wonderful just to enjoy this aspect of the book. The illustrations have a point as well and Eco remains a great writer in my mind with this achievment.
1,Needs To Be Better Researched,"Seems to be a reworking of earlier books like Arthur Marwick's book BEAUTY IN HISTORY. To assume that art isa representation of beauty of it's time is for future people to think we valued Picasso's notions of ideal form in his abstract depictions of women. Just as people falsely assume Ruben was painting beautiful women, he was doing nothing of the sort. His journals contain amble notes about how he preferred the male form. Sometimes art is just an expression or an exercise in politics, skill and who is paying the bill."
1,Fruit of Unethical Tactics,"Unfortunately Mr. Wead used highly unethical tactics in writing this book.He has admitted that he secretly taped Pres. Bush (then Gov. Bush) in researching this book. Not only that, but he then decided to play the tapes for the media to promote this book.Mr. Wead has shown that he is seriously ethically challenged and certainly not a friend as he was purporting himself to be."
5,Overcoming all odds to greatness.,"If there is one thing Doug Wead's book teaches, it is that one can achieve greatness despite idiot parents. Of course, many presidents also had intelligent, loving parents focused on the highest ideals, such as John and John Quincy Adams and William Howard Taft. Wead always makes American history alive. I came away with an understanding, an empathy and compassion for our presidents."
1,Character Revealed,It is apparent that Mr. Wead failed to heed the instruction of his mother and father about the sanctity of friendship.
1,Please don't reward cheats by buying their books,"Wead is a cheat, pure and simple. He records conversations without disclosing he is doing so, violating trust relationships with real people. Trust is a bedrock element of human interaction, and Wead has no concept of how to honor trust. For goodness sake, take a stand, a violation of trust should not be rewarded with profits from a book. Especially profits from a book destined to be appearing shortly at a dollar store near you."
1,Blackball this hack,"I saw this self promoter on GMA yesterday, claiming he released his audio tapes because ""I'm student of history,"" and ""my publisher made me."" Let hit this loser right where it hurts - his pocketbook. If you must read it, go to your local Barnes and Noble, grab a copy from the bargain bin, get a good cup of coffee, and find a comfortable chair to go to sleep in. Just don't send any money his way."
1,Weasle,This gentleman is a weasle-ish self promoter. Deserves to be ignored for violating the confidence of a friend.
5,Scummy thing to do to a scummy President,"The same thing happened to Clinton but nobody cared they were on a witch hunt. Sure its a scummy thing to do but to a scummy President, who has taken away our rights with his ""Patriot Act"" but in the end what goes around come around. Karma."
1,with friends like the author who needs enemies,only a sleezy person would tape telephone conversations with a friend then write about it............
1,The Left and the Right finally agree on something:,"Nobody should buy this book!What this author did was reprehensible in secretly taping two years of conversations with then-Governor Bush. Buying this book will reward extremely unethical behavior that, sadly, may also have repercussions down the line for future presidents."
5,Parenting Presidents,It is apparent that Doug Wead has intensely researched this great American story of how presidents are reared. I expect this book will become required reading in college level courses in American History. Intellectually stimulating. A must read for anyone interested in the psychological makeup of our leaders.
5,An invaluable and profusely illustrated reference for any prospective buyer or collector of the Volkswagen Bus line of vehicles,"Very highly recommended, The Essential Buyer's Guide: Volkswagen Bus by automotive experts Ken Cservenka and Richard Copping is an invaluable and profusely illustrated reference for any prospective buyer or collector of the Volkswagen Bus line of vehicles. Introducing the reader to an in-depth and extensively researched collection informatively covering every necessary detail of each model and year of the VW Bus, The Essential Buyer's Guide: Volkswagen Bus acts as an expansive and exclusive contribution and consumers reference. The Essential Buyer's Guide: Volkswagen Bus is very strongly recommended to all readers searching for a vivid and accurate compendium of the Volkswagon Bus and the how to guide for what to look for when buying, fixing, or collecting the popular vehicle."
4,To the point,"I enjoyed the brief read-it was quite perfunctory, and still fascinating. I wanted more...! Great read, very helpful. Now, for the actual purchase..."
3,does not do what it claims,"This book claims to bridge the gap between undergrad book and Jackson's. But I do not find it achieved the goal. It contains some good sections and I use it only as a secondary book. I still have to use Jackson's as my primary source. But that is not to say I like Jackon's. I hate it like a lot of people do, but I do not find a better alternative. Electrodynmics is the only area that I have not found a very good grad level text book for self study. I am only studying the low frequency part. My interest is not in waves. So, my comments only apply to that part."
3,I'm a skeptic...,"How to Defend yourself Against Alien Abduction is a book which teaches you several self defense tecnhniques on how to defend yourself from your typical Communion-style alien. In the book the author details a few encounters and what worked for them.I admit I am skeptical about alien abduction, having never experienced the phenomenon. I liked the techniques but I felt they would be somewhat obvious.... Maybe this book would be useful for a younger inexperienced person.I think I'd also like to read an updated book with more recent encounters. Many of the encounters described seemed really out of date and lacked credibility to this reader. Overall it was an interesting read but nothing mind-boggling. 3 stars."
1,Doesn't work in London,"I've been the subject of Alien abduction for several years now. It happens regularly. Usually on a Saturday night when I'm in London's West End. I got out, feeling bright and healthy with quite a bit of money in my pocket. However, after being forced to drink a strange yellow coloured liquid by my so called friends in several establishments around Soho, I usual wake up in a strange bed next to someone I don't know, with a feeling that I've been probed and find I have no money left. After reading this book I ventured back into Soho this Saturday and found that, this time some strange guy was in MY bed and he had that 'been probed' feeling."
3,A Honest Reply,"This book has honestly made it harder for me to conduct my little experiments on your puny race. It's unfortunate that when doused in raid, humans become so slippery. Furthermore, I find it hard to fathom why they can deny my phychic energy so adamantly with their ""god figures"". Too bad this this technique couldn't work in reverse! No matter, It is only a matter of time, before your entire race is subjugated by my kind. Most people don't even realize what is happening to them as I experiment with their bodies and minds. To the few that can resist, I will simply control those dearest to them and then systematically tear them limb from limb, thus driving you insane and vunerable to my intrusions."
2,This book must be banished.,"This book really needs to go. Although the techniques in this book do confound the greys and stop their telephathy, they also anger the greys. Their retribution will be extreme. If they can not conduct their (mostly harmless) experiments using peacefull telepathy, they will simply switch to using weapons. Your anti-telepathy hat will simply cause them to shoot you with a tranq. dart instead.At least when they use their telepathy I am able to forget the ordeal. If they stop using their telepathy more people will remember the procedures and be haunted by those memories as nightmares.We must remain ignorant so as not to seem a threat. Seriously do not read this book. This knowlege is dangerous. I, for one, welcome our little grey overlords!"
4,Provocative But Unexceptional,"This book raised so many more questions that it tried to answer. For instance, if it's true, as the author contends, that alien abductions can be prevented if the experiencer uses techniques which prevent Incubi/Succubi visitations, can a case be made ""aliens"" and ""demons"" are one in the same phenomenon? I would suggest reading this book along with one called COSMIC TEST TUBE, which gives the entire history of ideas about alien abduction and provides a few more possible answers!"
1,I object!,"As a Grey, I found this book to be entirely slanderous of me and my people and our mission on Earth. We are not here to ""abduct"" you, perform horrible experiments and make you doubt the reality of your own petty, wormlike existences. We are here as mere researchers, trying to discover what it is about humanity that makes you so... special. If the advice in this book were to be taken, why, our research would come to a complete standstill! Without subjects to study, how can we know more about you and your inconsequential lives? We are on your planet for entirely peaceful reasons, and not - I repeat NOT - here to steal your genetic material to build an invincible army to utterly annihilate those crustaceous scum on Alpha Centauri.What's more, it would completely mess up the fourth season of ""Who Wants to Be an Earthling,"" and you really don't want to screw with the networks like that.Don't buy this book! Think about the bigger picture!"
2,allergic,"This product might be a great product. However, I found out pretty quickly that I could not use it. So, make sure your system can tolerate it before purchasing it. I will stick with regular flaxseed, and forego the ""oil"" part."
3,Boring,"This book is like a textbook, not very interesting, but informative nonetheless. If you want a good reference on the topic, this is it. However, I would not recommend it to anyone who is not already familiar with the basics of accounting."
4,A great place to start.,"This is an excellent book for those looking into and exploring holography. It demistifies a lot of the jargon associated with holography, as well as the most difficult part... correct development. Unlike what another reviewer said, this book is up to date and has good sources for materials. I would not suggest this book for those who are already making holograms, it is really for those just starting out. But it is almost perfect for those beginers. The only downfall of this book is it's lack of setup diagrams, it only illustrates one. This keeps things simple but does not allow you to progress unless you do research outside the scope of the book. Over all this is an excellent book that truely makes ""real"" holography easy enough and cheap enough for anyone to do."
1,Not recommended,"This book is quite out of date. The supplier it lists for the plates no longer supplies them. The new supplier described ""Shoebox Holography"" in terms I can't post on a public website. Avoid this book; I wish I had."
2,"Nice concept, but...","I bought a DigiWiFi WL-F601 as an ""upgrade"" from a Canary Wireless HS10. The backlit display and the interface are improvements, but in a side-by-side comparison with the HS10, it only detects about half the wireless networks. I can be in the same room as the access point, but the DigiWiFi device may not detect it at all. I'll be keeping my HS10 and seeking a refund on the DigiWiFi."
1,"product fine, seller not worth it","the seller should be ashamed to have sold all 24 mars bars that i ordered with their best by date only 28 days away. my boyfriend loves mars bars, when we are in the u.k. he eats one a day, and the expiration date doesn't matter, but this was meant to be a present to last a few months, maybe most of the year. it is unbelievably frustrating that any professional company wouldn't rotate their stock, or consider the quality of the product they are shipping. did they fall of a truck? the mars bars are fine, for now. its the seller that you should avoid. no excuses."
1,Where are my Mars Bars????????????,I never recieved the Mars Bars that were ordered. I am very disappointed of the service. I'd like to ask for a refund.
4,Impressive work on complex subject!,"This book takes an extremely complex and daunting task and summarizes it for any lover of Minnesota history. Each city and county is listed, most with explanations of how they got their names and a little bit of their history. However, some of the entries are lacking in detail, but I can only imagine that some of Minnesota's place-name origins are lost to history. There is some information on stream and lake names too; however, if you're looking for detailed information on their origins, you may want to find a different book. That aside, this text is very well written and well documented, not to mention updated! I highly recommend this book."
3,Lack of elaboration,"A touching story but lack of elaboration! The author fail to make a strong connection between Oxford, Jack and Joy. He had attempted to do so but it is so superficial. Also, how Jack had forgiven God is not so enough elaborated. The credit should pay for the story itself, not the author."
1,Item is too brittle,One of my trays broke after only a few uses because the plastic is too brittle and shattered when I was trying to get the cubes out. I had high hopes for the product and loved the dishes that go with it. I will continue to use the 1 tray I have left and see how long it lasts.
1,Trays are too brittle,"One of trays cracked in half while trying to get the cubes out. I love the size of the cubes and the lids that came with it, but they are just not flexible enough."
1,Same size as regular ice cube trays!,I bought this because it claimed to have 2 oz in each serving (I read that somewhere and it also said that on the box when it arrived). I measured and it only has one ounce per cube! I vacuum pack the cubes the day after I freeze them so the lid does me no good. I will return this and keep my cheap ice cube trays to use instead. False advertising and a waste of my time.
1,"Only 1 oz, despite website and box's lies","I really don't see how the manufacturer and Amazon can lie about the volume like they do.The compartments are actually 1 ounce, not 2. Kidco's website says 2. One of the amazon descriptions says 2. Even the freaking BOX it came in says 2. I weighed it with water with my digital scale (accurate to 0.05 oz) and with 7 compartments, it was pretty much full at 7 oz, and nearly overflowing at 10. Obviously not the 14 oz that 7, 2oz compartments would hold.Thankfully baby food is sold by weight, so 2 or maybe 3 compartments will feed a baby the average 3 to 6 ounces by weight, but buyers will still be confused when they make a quart of baby food only to find their 2 trays will only hold a pint. If it happened in one spot, maybe it could be called an accident. But the website, one of 2 conflicting product descriptions on Amazon, and the product box? Lying about volume for things to make baby food is morally reprehensible. 1 star."
3,Don't waste your money,"Unless you have the time to make the food and put it into these containers, then by all means, purchase it."
3,Like it but only hold 1oz. not 2oz.,"These trays are great for freezing baby food and keeping other smells from your freezer away. However, I bought them thinking each tray would hold 14oz. of baby food, that is 2oz. per section. That means that even though you have 2 trays it only holds a total of 14oz. of food which only equals less than 7 meals in all. I am now just going to purchase the regular Rubbermaid ice cube trays which hold much more and just wrap them with plastic wrap like I've read in many books."
2,Not the best,"They way the cubes are shaped help when putting multiples and a small bowel, but one tray's handle cracked when getting cubes out. Not very easy to remove cubes. Am looking for another brand."
1,These trays stink!,"These trays are extremely inflexible which makes it difficult to get the purees out to feed your baby. After a couple of stints in the freezer, the lids will no longer fit to create a tight seal. Baby cubes are 10x more headache free!"
2,so frustrating!!,"I am so sorry I bought these trays. They are so frustrating! I have so much trouble getting the food out. I twist and turn in all directions, bang it on the counter and eventually scream until the food falls out. My hands hurt after trying to get the cubes out. Unbelievably difficult. The plastic is so hard, it takes so much effort the get anything out. I'm on the website now looking for different trays. These are garbage."
3,Good book,"It is a good book for beginners in the DSP field. However, I wish the book had been concentrated on applications right from the beginning, instead of spending too much space on well known mathematics that can be found in another classical books. I hope for the next edition to be better, as the book's name implies: real time applications. Nevertheless, the book is quite motivating for the reader and, if mature enough, it can be of extreme value for engineers and scientist that need to solve problems that require real time processing. But, again, this is only found within the last parts of the book."
4,A pleasant surprised!,I gotta say it was a good film. I was expecting it to suck since all i kept hearing was how the film was not so good when it was in the movie theatres. Jennifer lopez did a great job playing Puchi! Marc anthony was OK as hector lavoe. i mean the film centered more around Puchi and JLO delivered the goods. Oscar worthy?? I can't really say but she was good. Perhaps golden globe worthy.One thing for sure is that this isn't Swept Away. lolI'd reccomend it for those who like salsa or latin music. I think this movie was overlooked when it was first released in the theatres since it didn't break any box office records. And that's an unfortunate thing! I'm guessing that most of Americans just didn't care for hector lavoe. BUT the soundtrack CD was number one for weeks on the latin billboard charts so the latin people are still there for the man with the voice.
4,Beautiful Music,"I really enjoyed the movie. It was visually beautiful and the music was phenomenal. I didn't know anything about Marc Anthony, but I found out he has a wonderful voice. I actually purchased this movie for a friend who had lived in Puerto Rico in the early 70's. I thought she would enjoy the storyline as well as the music and scenery."
3,Pretty Rough to Watch,"Oh my favorate actors where so disappointing, I guess they were just acting and telling the life story of Hector, but it seemed so real. Maybe it would have been better if Jennifer did not say the F word so many times!"
4,Good Flick!,"I had second thoughts about picking up this flick, but Im glad I did! I learned one thing and thats dont believe the media a.k.a. Hollywood critics. This was a good movie and with suprisingly good acting from Mark Anthony and Jennifer Lopez. Its a sad story of Hector Lavoe's pilgramage to the U.S. in search of a music carreer when he hooks up with partner and musician willie Colon and gets put on to Weed and Heroine. Ofcourse with prolonged use of drugs sends Lavoes life spiralling out of control. A good movie of Hector Lavoes life and strong."
4,El Cantante,"This movie was good, but I find that it centralize too much on drugs and all his personal issues. Yes it was a big factor in Hector Lavoe's life, but I wish they would have concentrated more on what he represented to the people. I do accept that it was a huge problem in his life, and carried on til his death. But looking back, I wish the producer's would have changed a bit of their focus on Hector's personal issues, and made meaningful more of his triumph's as a great musician that brought alot of happiness to the public who listened to all his songs. That is how I want to remember Hector Lavoe."
3,THE SINGER,"Based on the life of salsa performer Hector Lavoe (died from AIDS and drug usage). As soon as you see the players using dope, you know what the outcome will be - beginning/struggling, success, dope, downfall and screw your family and friends. The theme was very trite and expected, but the salsa music was excellente. It was weird for my wife and I watching the movie, then twenty minutes later on the news, we hear that Lopez and Anthony are breaking up, but typically still respect one another - please us our privacy, etc. It was also strange seeing Lopez smoking grass and snorting occaine, along with Anthony. It was a movie true, but so contrary to Lopez's public persona. Would I watch it again? - not even in another twenty years. Lopez is talented and would enjoy seeing her again, and without Anthony and the portrayed drug usage."
5,Excellent,I have read a slice of life really enjoyed this book. If you have not read the first part you have to get it good from start to finish.I am now on part three can't wait for the last part wonderful books. Author has outdone herself three times in a row!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,exceptional music,"this record bares nmusic from a composer i have never heard of. As you might have noticed, I am no American. The music is entertainig, but does not have that special feeling. Good recording, very good combination. Those orchestras from Russia are impressive. One would expect from the titles sobre music, but that does not occur. The music is sparkling. This is excellent for a first encounter with this kind of music. Perhaps some pieces of Copland can be compared. The lack of originality (slightly) is the explanation for the four stars."
5,Fits perfect in 2002 Audi A6,I recently switched to a single din head unit to replace my old double din stock stereo and this did the trick perfectly. It has all the parts for single or double din. The pocket underneath is a huge bonus!
5,2001 RAPPING-N-ROLLING COMPILATION REVIEW COMMENTS,"I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM AND LOVED IT. THE SOUTHSIDE SOLDIERS AND DRAMA QUEEN SHOULD DO AN ALBUM TOGETHER,I KNOW THAT WOULD BE OFF OF THE CHAIN. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS INFORMATION PAGER FOR RAPPING-N-ROLLING OR SHOULD I SAY THIS WEBPAGE IS THAT THE PICTURE YALL GOT ON YOUR DISPLAY FOR RAPPING-N-ROLLING IS NOT THE RIGHT PICTURE FOR THAT ALBUM. YOUR ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE PICTURE THATS SAYS 2001 RAPPING-N-ROLLING AND THAT HAS ALL FIVE ARTIST AND THEIR PICTURE RIGHT ON THE FRONT OF THE ALBUM. I DON'T KNOW WHY YALL GOT THAT LIL JOKER PICTURE INSTEAD OF THE 2001 RAPPING-N-ROLLING FRONT PICTURE OR SHOULD I SAY ALBUM COVER. HOWEVER OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE THE ALBUM AND THAT MUG IS JAMMIN. MAN PLEASE PUT THE RIGHT PICTURE FOR RAPPING-N-ROLLING FOR THIS WEB PAGE. THANK YOU SOUTHSIDE SOLDIERS BIGEST FAN."
2,Carry along with laptop,This mike is fine for my purposes...a cheap mike to carry along with my laptop for occasional Skpe and Googletalk use. But it has a significant amount of static and tends to pick up a lot of background noise.
5,Superb Read!,"A superb book. Fascinating, extermely well written and difficult to put down. Weidensaul renders his vast curiosity, observation,and love of nature contagious."
4,Sometimes it is the hunting that counts,"I found this book fascinating. Extinct species can be a very depressing topic but this book isn't. It focuses on the hunt for extinct species and the hope that they are still out there instead of the ""look how we are destroying the planet"" theme that others have. The chapter on the ABC (alien big cats) in the British Isles was particularly enlightening - the tamer our world gets, the more we wish for something wild in it. The first half is somewhat stronger than the second but I was really disappointed it was over because it was so interesting. Well worth reading!"
5,ghost with trembling wings,"Quite an interesting book, and in some ways, rather haunting.There is a lot more to this book than the somewhat small size of it would seem.It is also somewhat engrossing."
2,25 lb block salt,They charged alot for shipping and handling.Its much cheaper if you order the 50lb of blocks of salt. Its like triple the price of what the salt cost it self.
5,More People Should Read This,"This book is one of the best books that I have ever read.If you find yourself cutting people off mid-sentence, finishing their sentences or not even listening to what they are talking about and just thinking about what you're going to say next. This is a must read for you.Listening is one of the greatest & easiest skills you can learn and this book really opens your eyes to why it is so important to implement into your life."
5,listening is a lost art!!!,"A great book that will help you in all areas of life, effective communicating is not just talking but listening for success!!!"
4,Good Basic Listening Techniques,"A short book with good basic listening information.I took 1 good idea out of it and that was worth the cost of the book.I liked his audio tapes better,but it was still worth buying his book."
1,A really BAD book,"I like books. I read a lot of books on various subjects. This book is not worth reading...it is boring, obvious, and absurd. The best part is the title and the cover, then it is rapidly downhill from there. DON'T waste your money."
2,Totally boring with some benefits,The style of the book is extremely disappointing. There's nearly nothing new in the book. It's an old wine in the new (and poor) bottle.
2,Fluff,"Sad to type but this book by a managment consultant offers obvious advice: unions win fewer elections when a company does not tolerate abusive managers; CEOs like Chainsaw Al are bad for morale; watch out for people who give ""left handed compliments""; the Japanese use different communication styles than we do.There are a few valuble nuggets: he offers a list of questions for ""idea selling""(that is, to get others to be more receptive to your ideas, and he talks about a style of writing that eliminates the ""to be"" verb---so change ""I am a lawyer"" to "" I practice law."" All in all, not helpful even for a starter book on communication and interpersonal relationships."
2,"Anecdotal, Mostly Fluff","I was excited to read this book and have a keen interest in social intelligence. The further you read into this book the more downhill you go, the author draws almost entirely on anecdotes and rarely grounds them in neuroscience, or any factual evidence.I had to put the book down, during the Dilbert chapter, the author regards technically savvy people as some sort of unsocial beast that must be reintroduced into society and we must better understand their voodoo technological ways.Whilst I agree the stereotype exists and that the author is technologically challenged - it is of my opinion that the topic was handled in a very socially ignorant way, especially for a book on social intelligence. This was the final nail in the coffin.I recommend the prospective buyer to pickup Social Intelligence by Daniel Goleman, it is a fascinating and practical read."
2,"Great idea, but no meat","I appreciated the theory presented, but I feel that this book is mostly fluff. There's no research presented, just personal anecdotes of people with obviously inept social skills. Bottom line, this book is verbose and filled with common sense at best."
2,Light above kitchen table,"Not really enthusiastic about the color, expected more but does light the kitchem area so does its purpose. Was looking for spot lights which would match the recessed ones and this is the best I could find."
4,Juliet Blyth aka Stella Riley aka Anna Marsh,"Cynbay49 says the author has a tiny output - yet indeed it is quite small, but if you search under her other names Stella Riley and Anna Marsh - you will find other books! In particular a sequel to Parfit Knight called Mesalliance.I really liked Lucifer's Champion - good characters, humour and a serious side. Well worth going to find and read."
5,Great record needle,"What can I say? I buy whatever version of this (names change every few years) that's out when my needle goes bad. They always work, and work for a long time. This is my second one in twenty years. What does that say for durability? AND I'm overcautious: I replace BEFORE I think it's bad so as not to damage the record. Good stuff."
4,Good Cartridge,Bought this for a 1978 Sony turntable. Sounds great. Nice cartridge and needle for the price. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a good sound at a reasonable price.
5,Great,"I bought this cartridge replacement for my old Pioneer PL-110 Turntable manufactured on 1982 and simply amazing, I had to do some adjusts to the turntable but finally has a great results. Even I had to modify the elasticity of the needle not to use balances, now the sound is fantastic. I recomend it."
1,Bad craftsmanship,"I just installed this needle on my record player, and noticed a slight thumping while it was playing. I took the needle off and checked my record for scratches (Which shouldn't be there as it's a brand new anniversary released album) or contaminates on the surface. There was nothing faulty with the record, so I put the needle back on and watched it. The needle was wobbling side to side, causing a thumping sound and static. Too bad I didn't get this on before the 30 day return limit, or else I'd be returning this piece of junk. I don't advise buying this needle, it's priced low for a reason, it doesn't work."
4,A little bit of sanity in the phono cartridge market,"It has been my (long) experience that Audio Technica products are generally competently designed and remarkably durable in actual consumer use. This little workhorse (AT-pl120)is no exception. It took the place of the standard cartridge included with an Icon USB turntable (a bad choice on my part, BTW), the stylus of which bent to an unusable angle for no particular reason. Rather than spend $22 on a replacement stylus, I popped for a pair of these A-T and am very satisfied. No audiophiliac pretensions, to be sure, but a well-made product at a decent price."
5,Does the job.,"It was easy to install in a 1980's vintage Dual brand turntable. It works, it sounds great. It was not expensive. The Shure cartridge I had before skipped or stuck frequently, and simply didn't work on the left channel, so this Audio Technica cartridge is a huge improvement, just because it works. I use it with aPyle PP-999 Phono Turntable Pre-Ampand aGriffin Technology iMic USB External Sound Card"
4,Good Cartridge,"Cartridge is a good fit for P-Mount tonearm on old Technics turntable.Replaces one almost identical.Works fine, sounds good.Nothing special, but very reliable product.Great value for anyone wishing to readd vinyl to their audio equation on the cheap.By the way, this does come with mounting hardware for a regular headshell, so does not have to be used with a P-Mount."
3,A good but bright cart!,"The cart tracks records very well. Some LPs sound much better (less distortion) than my older cartridge. The sound is very bright, though, almost too much treble!"
3,It can give you gas,"It is almost perfect. You can mix it with almost anything and it has lot of calcium. Well, it does give me gas. Not everyone has the same problem."
5,"Odorless, Tasteless, Mixes well with everything","Not gritty. This is not an exciting product but among those of its type, it's probably the best. I've not tried it in plain water, but it works great with any other food or liquid."
5,Believe the hype!,"I'm trying to lose weight and be healthier in 2010. I know from previous use of fiber products that they lower my cholesterol wonderfully, but in the past they were always gritty and changed the taste of whatever I mixed them with. All the positive reviews of Benefiber made me decide to try this one instead of the old standby. Wow! I've only been using it for 3 days, and not nearly the amounts they list on the package, but I can already tell a difference. So far I have mixed it with smoothies, juice, and a bean soup. It dissolved perfectly in each food and didn't change the taste at all. This supplement will be on permanent rotation now. It really is as great as everyone says!"
2,Too expensive,"The product itself is fine, dissolves in most liquids without any taste or caking, but Benefiber is just way too expensive to keep buying. We switched to a generic equivalent of wheat dextrin from our local grocer that's less than half the price of this."
3,not sure,it could be a placebo for all i know. i stopped taking it several months ago and have not noticed any real difference. make a journal and record your every move.
2,Who bought all the Benefiber?,"I have been a decade long user of Benefiber because I don't always have time to sit and eat as healthy a meal as I should. Benefiber helps me get the fiber I often don't have time to from fruits and veggies. But I think there is something rotten in, whereever Benefiber is being shipped from. In the last 3 months I have watched the price of this TRIPLE. YES, TRIPLE. Anyone have any idea's as to why? I have asked Amazon but the only explanation I get is, ""Seller's can sell for whatever they wish."" I pointed out that this is PRICE GOUGING and that Amazon has a duty to it's customer's to not let this happen. Seems that isn't something Amazon worries about anymore."
1,Wrong Color.,"I realize that there are several pictures of this item, however the actual item looks nothing like the picture in color or tint. It is not a 'pewter' finish but rather a dull tope-ish color. It is perfectly functional but I was very disappointed that the color is nowhere close to the pictured item. It clashes on my desk and I had to order a new one. It was a $20 mistake I can live with, but if you are buying this for the color/tint, my advice is DON'T."
3,If you like Soviet-era office supplies...,"...this is the monitor stand for you. As others have noted (but not stated emphatically enough) the color is a dull gray-green, and the design is not sleek so much as ingenious--in the sense that it seems to be made of repurposed metal components from a Moscow locker room circa 1965. That said, if the dimensions work for you, that's probably the most important thing. You can always spray-paint it. I bought it so I can tuck a Mac Mini under a monitor. It gives me about 2 inches more in height than I need, but that way I can move the Mini around under it, toward the back or toward the front depending on how much access I need, and can reach in easily. Still, I would have preferred it to be lower. But it's perfectly serviceable, and priced right, and if your walls are adorned with Soviet propaganda posters then you'll love it."
2,"Dual monitors, different heights","These are not made to the same specs. I purchased this from local store to raise my monitors to eye level. Now theyre not even being that one stand has a different bend then the other. It is definately not the desk since both monitors on the desk are level.I am returning and going to seek a blown plastic option assuming that those will be better.For a single monitor, this stand should suffice."
2,Pewter color = greenish,"We love the Allsop stands, but were very surprised by the pewter color - its funky greenish tone, not a shiny metallic finish as in the photo. Yuck!"
5,Great Product!!,"Although this is just a simple desktop stand, I love it. It does the job. If you use a wireless keyboard and have limited desk space this is good because when you are not using your keyboard you can put it under the stand while you do homework or write papers."
4,Great,"This stand is great and does what I intended for it to do. However, it is a little wobbly depending upon how my laptop is sitting."
3,"Good size, awful color",This item is *not* pewter silver. It is a an olive green/beige color. I would never have purchased it in this color. The picture is deceptive.
4,Allsop 27021 Metal Art Jr,"Does a good job. A little lighter in color that I thought it would be. Does fine for laptops alone, but probably wouldn't be big enough if I wanted to have a docking station and external flat panel monitor."
3,A bit narrower than expected.,I measured the laptop that I planned to place below the shelf and thought it would fit on top of the legs - just barely and not safely. I ended up putting the laptop elsewhere and just putting the monitor on the shelf. It's nicely made and sturdy.
2,"Does not support 19"" or larger CRTs","Do not be fooled when the description says this stand holds up to 21"" monitors - that is only true for *flat-panel* monitors, not traditional CRT monitors. Note that the weight rating says 50 pounds! Most standard 19"" monitors weigh 60 pounds or more. I purchased this item at a Staples near me, and brought it home to use with my 19"" CRT. After placing the monitor on the stand, the stand bobbed up and down and seemed as if it would completely bend at any moment."
3,not exactly,"the item is sturdy and works well for its designed purpose however, the color of the item is misleading the item is lighter than shown it's more of a grayish greenish tan-ish color... it doesn't match the rest of my office products and therefore I'm not sure I will be keeping it"
4,Works great with a Xbox 360,"I got this so I could place my 20"" LCD HDTV on top of my xbox 360. The space underneth is PERFECT for this use. The dimentions are just slightly bigger than the xbox by still enough to allow plenty of air flow.It also is quite sturdy an could hold a fairly heavy TV or monitor.As for looks, it rather simple and not going to ""go with"" many decores! But works great and I would highly recommend it!"
5,Allsop 27021 Monitor stand,"Allsop 27021 Monitor standProduct works great, is of fine quality and is reasonably priced. Item was delivered in rapid fashion and was well packed. Thank you very much .r/f/phx"
2,Nice Looking Stand but Horrible Welding Job,I like the looks and size of this stand but who ever welded the top to the tubing did a bad job. There is a warping on the top due to poor positioning during the weld process. It is very obvious. Quality control is lacking.... but then again it is only a stand.
1,Warped after one run in the dishwasher,"I have a smaller one of these but this one warped immediately. I took too long to return it so I kept it but I can't use it since it's warped. Honestly, it seems like the quality of everything has gone down sharply in the last few years. I can't recommend this. A cutting board must be flat."
5,"Great, Sturdy Cutting Board!",We haven't had much luck with cutting boards. This is the third one we've tried in the last couple months. I guess third time's a charm! We use this regulary and it seems like it's going to last quite awhile. It's a great size and very sturdy. Also easy clean-up! I would recommend this one!
2,Nice Design but don't put in dishwasher,We have purchased two of these and love the size and the channel around the edge on one side. I would normally not write about an item like this but felt compelled after our second board warped. This happened within a week of ordering and has gotten worse each week. If we hand wash its fine but the heat from a dishwasher is proving more than this plastic can handle.
4,Big but slippery,I am overall very satisfied with this cutting board. My only complaint is that it slides all over the place on my counter top. I'm gonna need to buy a rubber mat or something to put underneath.
3,"Good board, but beware, will warp!","I already own a bamboo cutting board, but sometimes I get sick of having to wash it immediately so that juices don't seep in. I searched all over to find a cutting board that I could use and then just toss in the dishwater for cleanup and I landed on this. The cutting board itself is large and works well, however the board DOES WARP if you stick it in the dishwasher (I even made sure to turn off the high temperature wash and the heated dry). Another sticking point is its lack of nonslip feet/backing. I was fully aware that this product didn't have nonslip backing, but I was willing to compromise on that to get a board that did not warp when washed in the dishwasher. Its a little frustrating that this happened because of all the research i put into it. Overall a decent cutting board but if I were to do it all over again I would have purchased something with a nonslip backing, even if I had to hand wash the thing."
5,Perfect for sitting under our espresso machine,"I use this board to sit under our espresso machine, for two reasons. First, because we have to pour water into the machine, it sometimes spills out and the channel on the cutting board catches it (though it would be nice if it was a bit deeper.) Second, we have to pull the machine out to pour the water, and this board slides nicely on our counter to allow us to do this. Perfection!"
1,Turned Pink When Washed in Dishwasher,This cutting board turned a really unattractive shade of pale pink/orange when I washed it in the dishwasher. I've owned many white cutting boards and have never had this problem before.
3,Too Heavy,"I like the size of this cutting board but it is very heavy. And it slides around on the counter, which means you have to put something damp underneath. When looking for another cutting board I will really pay attention to the weight. I have a smaller KitchenAid cutting board that I like much better and holds to the counter. Now that I think of it, I should have just gone ahead and purchased the bigger KitchenAid."
1,A weak effort,Over generalizes. Wolpert uses an innocent remark about a bath in the nude to suggest that Nehru had a homosexual encounter. Wolpert does not show any great insight in his synthesis of the material.
2,Disappointing,Didn't shed any light on Nehru's personality in spite of Wolpert's psycho-historical approach.
3,Broke on the ball end after two days.,"This string lived up to it's reputation in every way. It was loud, sweet, and dear, breaking when I was tuning up - after changing my bridge. Maybe I turned too fast. The bright side: It was also not consistent with the Jargar D next to it, so maybe its breaking was all for the good."
1,Lacks any emotion,"This book lacks an emotional core and those seeking intellectual or emotional stimulation should look elseware. The characters are stereotyped, flat and never leave the pages of the book. Gifford believes lashes of sex, violence and murder will make his Sailor and Lula stories interesting and fails dismally. Avoid!"
4,My Blue Heaven - a fascinating history of L.A. Suburbia,"I loved this book! I never thought of suburbs as being all thatinteresting or important, thinking that cities were important, and suburbs were minor satellites around them. This book, however, tells the real story of the working class suburbs of L.A. and how they developed. Often, one hears that the purpose of studying history is to understand why things are the way they are today. As a history buff, this book motivated me to travel to LA and ride around the streets of South Gate and some of the other suburbs, visualizing the events of days gone by. Ms. Nicolaides shows how these suburbs changed from street after street of self-built houses inhabited by struggling workers, chicken coops, and makeshift stores into the dynamic communities of today. Once I started it, I was totally engaged through the last chapter."
4,Explains a Lot,"Coming on a little late as opposed to most of these reviews, I just wanted to add that if you grew up in this area as I did, this work explains a lot of why South Gate evolved as it did. I can relate to much in this book, and even though I don't now nor didn't then have many of the beliefs and standards that the residents did, it helps to explain them.South Gate is just a shadow of what it was in the post war years, with the good paying manufacturing jobs all but gone (of course that's status quo for many places), and has really ""returned to it's roots"" as commented by the author.I avoid the area now, it depressed me the last time I visited."
2,Good value for the money.,"I was able to install the viewer on Windows XP.The pages are photographed and don't display very clearly.However, if you want to check out the old issues and don'twant to commit very much money, this is okay."
5,Great period book!,"The opportunity to view a collection from such a vibrant time in motorsports history, by a noted and aclaimed photographer, should be seized. Any die-hard racing enthusiast is certain to appreciate the many vantage points of the photos in gaining a sense of what the period was truly like."
2,poor sound,"This product lacks an on/off button, a volume control, sound-cancellation, and does not have USB plug-in. It does have a long, flexible goose-neck. Tried talking to a brother in Hong Kong via Skype. He could barely hear me and told me not to buy such a cheap product. If you want to catch up with family/friends overseas using Skype, invest in a better microphone."
5,Complete satisfaction,"The mirror was well constructed. Even when fully extended the arms support the mirror very firmly. The chrome finish matches the chrome finish of my medicinecabinet. When complementing the larger bathroom mirror, the 1x or the 8x mirroris perfect for use in trimming my beard or shaving. I installed the mirror on the side of my medicine cabinet. By using small machine nuts and bolts I attached the holding plate to the chrome cabinet side piece. Therefore some drilling was required. All in all it is a good value for the price."
3,Good fuctional mirror,Waited for a while to use this mirror before reviewing it. It was a nice usable product but in the bathroom the base starts to rust. The could have made some of the metal parts with bett plating
3,Mirror,Seems just as good as much more expensive mirrors. It did become stiff and finally unable to move. My husband took it apart and found it full of shavings. After cleaning them out it moves freely. Wish it was longer.
5,Great magnifier!,Just as expected! Great! I used one at a hotel and had to have one of my own. I looked up the part number and ordered it!
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"Good quality mirror, easy to install, good price, would highly recommend if you need a mirror to shave by or see yourself from behind in your bathroom."
5,I love this mirror!,A great mirror that mounts easily. A big help for someone who needs to see close up.
5,Great Product,I used this product in a hotel in Maui and found it to be superior. I knew that I had to have one for my home and found it at Amazon.com. The quality of design and manufacture are superb and the clarity of the mirrors also fit this category.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for this bathroom accessory.
5,a better shave,"I had looked for a wall mount convex shaving mirror several years ago after appreciating them in better hotel rooms, coming up empty I went hand held. But after my daughter appropriated the hand held during my last trip I looked again. First resigned to spending a couple hundred if I had to, I was relieved to find this one for 30 bucks. It mounted well, works great, seems to be of excellent quality. Now if I could find a lighted one just like it."
5,Does the job and looks good doing it,"An excellent chioce. Well made, good grade of mirror, not hard to mount. I'm very happy with it. The oiled bronze matches my faucet and decor. I'm glad that I made the purchase. I've been using it for months and miss it when I travel."
5,Love it!,This is exactly what I was looking for. Didn't want the bulkiness of a lighted mirror and the bronze finish is perfect.
5,wall mount magnification mirror,"This is a great mirror. I currently have one just like in the house we sold, and am glad to have found one for the new house. It's very convenient, the extension is great and I can easily flip between the regular and magnification mirrors."
3,Great mirror but...,"I received the mirror and was excited to install it. When I attempted the remove the screws that held the mirror to the mount, one of them was so tight that the screw head actually snapped off the screw and was stuck in the plate. I then had to drill the head out and find a replacement screw that would fit. It was a pain, but once accomplished, I installed the mirror. I really like it, although it only swings back against the wall one way - the other way gets too tight and will not work. I hope the manufacturer reads this and informs the factory as the product can easily be improved."
1,Very surprised in the lack of quality...,since I read the mirror was the same found in hotels. Right out of the box the chrome color is peeling and showing the copper color underneath. The swivel on the mounting plate squeaks and does not glide like the other swivels. Just printed the return shipping label and will not be ordering another one.
5,Great little mirror,"I bought this after I moved into an apt with a mirror that was pretty far from the sink and did not fold out. I would have to lean really close to the mirror to make sure I didn't miss a spot shaving.The mirror was easy to install and shouldn't leave to much damage. (usual screw holes). Used a low power drill.The arm for the mirror is sturdy and easily folds in and out and stays in place.Both mirrors work well. The magnifiedmirror is perfect.Only negative I have come across is that, like almost any mirror, it doesn't clean that well. Windex eventually does the job, but does seem a little tougher than usual."
4,Just what I wanted and received from Amazon,"Based on the product description and the customer reviews, I expected that this product was just what I wanted. I was not disappointed. The mirror is clear and undistorted, the material and finish are of good quality, and the unit was simple to install. I was able to install the unit to a stud, so I cannot comment on the use of the wall anchors that were included in the package. The Jerdon is a quality product priced right."
4,Very nice mirror,"Mirror was easy to mount. The reflection is good and not distorted. I would buy again. One of the joints is a little stiff, but may get smoother with use."
2,Buy a different brand,"I purchased this mirror because I wanted a round wall mount in a bronze finish. I should have bought the Conair oval wall mount in bronze. The Jerdon is squeaky and doesn't move well. I have tried loosening and tightening the screws, using WD-40, nothing works. Disappointed."
4,Matches other accessories perfectly,The oil rubbed bronze finish on this matched our other bathroom accessories perfectly and the price was much better than some others we looked at.
5,Great mirror!,"This mirror is just as described, very nice in quality, high end for the price. Easily installed also, important for the less than handy do-it-yourself type."
4,Nice product in affordable price,"After we remodeled our bathroom and changed the layout, my wife has to lean to get close to wall mirror when she puts on the make up. This new pull out mirror works just perfectly. Besides, the brushed nickel finish is beautiful. The only issue is she has to be very careful not to scratch our newly painted bathroom wall when she folds the mirror back to ball."
5,Excellent Choice,"Well built, stylish mirror. Easy to mount. Sturdy. All the magnification I need. I am very pleased with this product. It was just what I was hoping to find for my bathroom."
4,a great mirror,I bought this mirror for putting on eye make up and it is everything that I hoped it would be
5,Great product,Wonderful mirror! Just the right size and arm length. Easy to mount and very sturdy. Seller was quick to send and well packaged.
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED!,"Despite at least a half dozen e-mails to Amazon.com to let them know I have never received this product, I am still waiting for resolution some 5 weeks later. Therefore, I am in no position to rate a product never received. If I do not receive a positive response from Amazon.com that my credit card will be credited for this item--I will not do future business with Amazon.com."
3,for the price its not that bad,"Pros: I got the product and it seems like its built well and its heavy. It also looks good.Cons: The hinges maybe noise with folding/unfolding, fixed issue with some lubricant. The hinges were also tight, so i loosen the hinge screw a little and that seems to fixed the issue. No anchors or screws provided, at least not in the box i got.Overall it looks like its built well and for the money its not a bad deal. Be aware that its not lighted and the mirror views might not always be the greatest without light."
5,"Nice, looks great! Easy to install, wish arms were a little longer.","Nice, looks great! Easy to install, wish arms were a little longer, I wanted to mount to the studs in the wall for the most security, but if the studs are 6"" too far away, you will still have to lean over your counter a little. My wife loves it though!"
4,Good purchase for the price,"I'm happy with this product given that it was very cheap. I had to use different anchors for the screws when mounting it on the wall, but other than that, there is no problem with this product."
3,okay.,"Install it on a stud, that is all I am going to tell you. It needs to be secure otherwise your wife is going to come over to it one day and rip it out of the wall. also you have to make sure you install it at the correct height as the height is not adjustable, which would have been a nice feature. The mirror is great, it magnifies well, and it looks good, just make sure you screw it into a stud, and make sure you have a stud available for the place you want to put it."
4,"Could be a ""5""","But, it does not adjust up and down. It moves sideways and forward. That makes it a little ineffective. Other than that, it is solid and does what it is supposed to do."
2,Disappointing,"The mirror has been installed in the shower for a couple of weeks, we wipe it off after each use. There is rust in two area which is unsettling!"
2,poor design for mirror,"I reluctantly ordered this mirror after bad reviews. This mirror is mounted in my bathroom and I have discovered a major design flaw. The swivel between the mirror and the wall mount is a screw type swivel which tightens or looses depending on the was you adjust the mirror over time. If you normally turn the mirror in one direction for use, the screw will eventually become over tightened and break from the mount which renders it useless. I had to dismount the mirror and fashion a new swivel out of a bolt and nut. I do not recommend buying this mirror."
1,Wrong Color,"In the picture, this mirror is chrome. On the box, it also says chrome... however, this mirror is actually a blackish brown color wiht a brushed looked. Nothing like expected."
4,Pretty good for the price,"Good mirror, although lighting can be an issue and maybe should have spent more and got a lighted mirror also the magnification isn't amazing. But overall it's a pretty good mirror. You do get what you pay for. Of the mirrors in this class, it's probably one of the best."
2,Not for bathroom,"Length:: 0:23 MinsIt start to rust in about a month after installing in not-so-wet bathroom. So , generally mirror is good , just not for bathroom."
3,Works as designed - but rusts quickly!,"I was very happy with this product after installation and initial use.But was surprised to find rust forming after only 2 weeks!The ""Nickel"" Finish does not protect the product from corrosion through normal use."
5,P,I really like this mirror. The 5x magnification lets me see how well I shaved. The adjustable feature works well. Good value for the price.
5,Great mirror...Now my son wants one for his bathroom!,"This little mirror far, far surpasses anything I could have hoped for in quality and usefullness. Plus it fits in nicely with the bathroom decor. The only drawback is that now everyone comes to my bathroom for zoomed closeups! My son wants me to get him one, and his girlfriend wants one too. The price fit the value, so no complaints anywhere. Thanks Jerdon, you have a great product!"
5,"""Sight"" for sore eyes!","Excellent mirror. It is well made, attractive to look at, and reasonably priced. I, too, got the idea to buy one after a motel stay where there was one in the bathroom. I enjoyed using it so much I knew I would have to have one at home. I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,Student rates teacher,"I am a sometime student of Mr. Chodos, and all the things that attract me to his teaching are contained on this CD. The sound is gorgeous, the time-scale hypnotic. In the Allegretto, he reveals an melancholic side to the piece that has never been heard before. D 960 is gripping and expressive in ways no one else can imitate."
4,Good Book,"Overall a great book, very short and to the point. The only complaint I had was that the countless abreviations used by the author make the book nearly impossible to follow. Other than that the book offers great insight into the psychological war fought against Japan."
2,You really don't need this book!,"Believe me, I'm a true ALIEN-phile but I was disappointed by this book! I was looking forward very much to be finally able to buy so many official books on the new part of my favorite movie series! But then I got this: it doesn't even give you the final version of the movie script! In fact the dialogues in the novel by A.C. Crispin are much more accurate than this script book! It really isn't very great! OK, it has some nice photos from the movie, but if you want these (and more) I'd recommend you the ""ALIEN: RESURRECTION-Postcard Book""! But if you really need to have everything about ""ALIEN: RESURRECTION"", just go ahead and order it!"
2,Problems with wireless,"Pros:-Cheap compared to other brands with similar functions.-Nice, when it works.Cons:-I dont like the o-rings the use to mount everything. Seem stable enough.. but I prefer zip-ties.-Finicky. My first ride I got ""too many signals"" error message for the first 2 miles, even though I was by myself, and not using the HR monitor. My second ride, the speed sensor worked 95% of the time, but the HR monitor kept reading 0, even though I had wetted it as described.-Some people prefer the 4-button interface, but I don't. Hard to remember what each button does in each mode. Not a big deal though.I gave this one a try... but in the end I returned it and when with the Cateye Strada Wireless, which took 2 minutes to install, and works perfectly."
4,"Great, with some initial problems.... And NO cadence!!!","First of all, once I got it installed, this item worked great. It would find both the heart monitor and the speed sensor seconds after I started pedaling. The actual installation was a breeze. The supplied o-rings as well as the zip ties make setup very easy with absolutely no tools required.However, all the supplied batteries were dead. If you are having problem installing the item make sure you put new batteries in it. Also, in the description, amazon says the item has a cadence sensor, this IS NOT TRUE.Otherwise, good product..."
5,very good product,This is the best HR monitor for my bike riding I have ever had. I have owned three or four over the years of a different brand.Thank you
2,funky computer,"I like the concept of an integrated bike computer HRM, but this unit is a pain. It sometimes wakes up speaking German, other times it doesn't want to wake up until a half hour into the ride. Apparently (according to the shop where I purchased it) you have to remove it from the mount before a ride, reinsert it, then spin the wheel so it synchs properly with the speed sensor. Just be glad Sigma doesn't make your car's speedometer, or you'd have to remove it every time you get into your car, and spin the wheel to make it work. Dumb product!"
2,interesting but shallow,"I was eager to read this book, to understand how publish/subscribe in general and TIBCO middleware in particular change system architecture and business strategy. What is now possible that is not supported well by traditional client/server systems? And who would know more about this topic than Ranadive, the founder and CEO of TIBCO?Unfortunately this book does not deliver. The examples are shallow, explaining a little but not to a deep enough level to communicate more than superficialities. And the text between the example is repetitive: too much breathless ad copy and not enough content."
2,It was useful.,The book covered some of the real-time technology that TIBCO and other IT firms developed. But it is outdated. The environment now in year 2003 is very different.
3,*NOT* for beginners!,"I consider myself to be an experienced beginner in aerobics, meaning I have been working out for a good while now and generally find any tape labeled ""beginners"" or ""easy"" works well for me. This is by far the most strenuous ""easy"" tape I've found. The music is great, the sets are terrific, and Brenda's enthusiasm is inspiring. I found her cues to be easy to follow and the steps were easy to learn. *BUT* the pace is very fast (especially for floor work, i.e. abs and buns workout) and I was sore the next day after using this tape. I bought it used and am glad I didn't pay full price -- I will try it again but really found it a bit too intense."
2,Extremely Difficult to Follow,"I've been doing aerobics for years -- at an aerobic studio. I've also been looking for an aerobic tape to use at home on the days I can't make it to the gym. It's my opinion that one needs to be on amphetamines to keep up with the Disco Workout video. It is extremely difficult to follow, cues are - for all intent and purposes - non-existant and certainly didn't get my heart rate to where it should be during an aerobic work out. I recommend you let this one pass right on by."
4,This video got me back into my questinable spandex!,"If you want a fun, dancy workout with all the retro moves we know and love, and an amazing disco sound while you are sweating in your spandex, this is the video for you...love,love,love it!!! Phoebe"
3,Just OK,"I really love disco music and had high hopes for this one, but...The moves aren't taught very well - and I am generally very good at learning choreography as I used to dance in college. Some of the moves are a bit silly, and don't really get your heart rate up. They also repeat one of the songs, and it would have been nicer to have gotten one more tune in. However, it's still somewhat fun, and the toning at the end is a good addition."
3,A pleasant retro-twee excursion,"This three-piece from Sacramento, CA produce pleasant, summery pop in juicy bite-size morsels. With no-nonsense punk drumming, new-wave-y hooks (sounds like something on Cherry Red circa 1982), and naive singing, they harmonize and jangle their way through 10 songs in 30 minutes, and although they're not breaking any new ground, it's a cute way to spend half an hour. Standouts: ""So Much To Do"" and ""The Weather"", and the tribute to Olivia Newton-John, ""Olivia."""
3,Lead Woman Portrayed as Man,"As long as you don't mind a lead character who is a woman who lacks every female characteristic, it's okay. The author is a woman, but her protagonist acts and talks like a cartoon of a thuggish, inarticulate male warrior whose highest aspiration is fighting for a living. Worse, action takes place in a world where a substantial percentage of young female population feels the same way and are all physically as strong or stronger than men. Writing and plot were fine and I am tempted to buy second book in series, but probably won't so I got author's award-winning ""Among Others,"" which was a much more interesting book though a ""stand-alone"" when I prefer book series."
2,Narration was stilted....Not My cup of tea.,"I TRIED to read the ""King's Peace. But I just can't abide poorly written first person narratives. (I'm not a big fan of First Person narratives to begin with), but poorly written ones are worse. Also, there is a large Dedication which takes up prime 'real estate' at the front of the book, followed by another narration about he main character 'looking back on her life.' For me, I just hate, hate, hate, knowing what will happen in advance. And this writing nearly ruined it for me.As I progressed through the book, I found the dialog to be stilted and unrealistic, especially the internal dialog. This book was just NOT my cup of tea."
4,Great book,"Unlike most of the other people that reviewed this book, I wasn't sure if it was a historical recreation or not, I just read it because it looked good. I'm a real fan of all heroine fantasies, and this was one of the better ones I've read. This is a book of honor, fighting, pride, loss, and choices. I really enjoyed reading this book and couldn't wait to get back to it at the end of the day. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure books."
2,Not Good,"I did not particularly like this book. In fact it is the only book that i have ever put down. First of all I like romance in boks that I read and the fact that there wasn't any romance disappointed me. I could have gotten over that if there was some kind of friendly relationship, friends, family, somebody that she was close to (besides Garrah). It seemed to me that everybody that she became friends with died and when she did have a firendly relationship with somebody, Ms. Walton did not go into enough detail for me to care what actually happened to that character. I think that my main motivation for not wanting to conyimue reading this book was that i didn't care what happened, whicyh is very bad when reading any knid of book. In short I did not think that this book was worth reading, and I'm sorry if I gave away any of the story to those who are deciding whether to buy this book or not. I hope that I was helpful."
4,Book Was Outstanding - Pearl@aol.com,Book was excellent. Glad I bought it. Will read it many times and pass it on to family & friends.
1,I dont like books that were written without permsission,The overall story was good with a few minor glitches.....but overall I will only give the book a ONE STAR because AILEEN DID NOT have permission to write this book.....However.....Jerry does have his OWN auto-biography coming out in November...I suggest you read THAT one.....I bet that AMAZON wont have the guts to leave this post up.....THANK U!!!MOUSEY
3,Yeah.. but....,"So the last 2 reviews for this unit were some 2 years old and I would have thought that Karcher would have heard about this lack of an adapter issue and rectified the situation for us future purchasers.Maybe not.The nozzle did come with some screw-in adapter for the head but not the quick-disconnect. Bummer there... they could at least include a nipple (really - that's what it's called) that wold mate up to the Karcher spray wand.That said the unit is a beast - quite heavy which was a bit off-putting until you hit the trigger.Shazam!This thing can carve concrete (maybe) and is wicked powerful. Had the head been built lighter the thing would be much less controllable.As far as functionality - this unit is PERFECT for blasting out stubborn areas on your sidewalk, driveway or your molars (OK you probably shouldn't use on your teeth).Recap:Still missing the parts-n-pieces. Rates a 1 on that.Functioned PERFECTLY. Rates a 5 on that.Round-up the .5 to a full 3-Star (aka Lieutenant General)."
1,Awful Picture Quality,"I agree with everything others have said about the film's content but the picture quality is just awful, as if EMI had simply transferred a VHS to DVD without any remastering. Many scenes are spoilt by the very snowy picture and the general fuzziness. It is a disgrace and should never have been put on the market in this state: I certainly won't buy another EMI DVD. And it's not cheap either!"
5,Timeless,"The details of this documentary have been done wonderfully by others. As I watched it years ago and saw some clips recently, I will only add ""For those who are willing to let themselves appreciate life, music and dedication I say - Young people there is Hope for you also."""
4,Tongue in cheek,"Well, I agree this is the irreverence that the Everest genre was waiting for! I laughed quite a bit, and smiled at much of it.The Dianas (Princesses that is) expedition really tickled my funny bone the most. How inspired to take two such icons, both ludicrously unattainable for most mere mortals, and marry them.Humour is such a subjective thing, you will either love it or hate it. But don't condemn this take on Everest because of a misapprehension of what it is about. It is a cartoon book. It does actually say more about the reality of the sponsorship and money side of 'personal Everests' than all the thousands of words I have read on the subject thus far."
4,Helpful understanding of the reality of this type of abuse,"Good introduction of topic-recognizing and recovery from ritual abuse. Practical, helpful, needed encouragement for the hard work of recovery. Worth waiting for your order to arrive. David Brown, M. Ed in Counseling"
5,Stormbreaker,"I ordered Stormbreaker by Anthony Horowitz for my nephew who loves to read. Before I packaged and sent it, my 16 year old son saw it. My son is not a reader at all. In fact he would rather do anything but read. He said he would try it, and has been reading it ever since. He loves the book. I am hoping he continues on with the series."
4,its good... but has no imagination,"look, im not saying alex rider sucks, but it isnt legit writing. when i first read this book (back in 2008) i thought it was a great book an it is but now after reading james bond, i realized a lot of the material was exactly the same as a james bond novel! after that i just wasnt sure. but not all his books are like this. try the diamond brothers series, he shows plenty of imagination there. just think, if alex rider was more imaginative, how much better could it be?"
3,None,i've seen and read much better.the book was enjoyable be less sirous and more funny.if you read the sires it's a hit or miss
4,Stormbreaker,"The book Stormbreaker was written by Anthony Horowitz. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys exciting spy stories. The story is about a 14-year-old boy Alex Rider, who goes under-cover to investigate the death of his Uncle Dan. Alex becomes a spy inside of a computer company. He must use his wits and knowledge to bring down the company which is planning to cause biological terror the day when all computers go off line. Read and find out what happens."
3,Review,"This book was an ok book. It had some exciting parts but, the plot seemed to drag on and on. This book is about a boy named Alex, who has an uncle that is a spy but he doesn't know it. One day his uncle dies and Alex has to take over the mission. He isn't that talented at it but he has to anyway. All of the gadgets he uses are based around kids so that was interesting. His mission is to try and figure out what is wrong with these people who are creating computers and giving them away, something seems fishy with it. In the end he makes it without dyeing. This book does have it's high points and I suggest that you read it, if you are just looking for a light book to read when your bored."
3,"I know James Bond, and you're no James Bond","I can see why this book and series are so popular-- full of action, cliff-hanger, real danger, technology, and a big story. I don't fault any of this. And I don't mind the similarities with Bond, even down to the characatured cast of villians. But where Stormbreaker lost stars for me was that Alex himself was not enough like Bond. Alex isn't too perfect; he just isn't heroic enough. Take the playboy out of Bond and he's still a patriot. Alex is too post-modern I suppose for that. But then why go through with the whole mess in the first place? It's not revenge. It's not love of country. Then what? Alex needs more than fear of eviction to drive him to fight evil."
4,James Bond only better,"In this book is about a teenaged spy named Alex Rider. His uncle died from a car wreck, at least that is what the bank said.This book is good because it gets going right in the beginning. This book is full of action for example, Alex get trapped in a car and almost get kill but he gets out of the car in time. He is almost just like James Bond only he is younger and he doesn't get guns. If you like James Bond you will like this book. This book is for people who are from 9-12 years old."
4,Good series,My kids who love mystery books are drawn to this series. They love the suspense and clues to figure out the mystery.
4,Alex Rider is a true spy!,"Anthony Horowitz's Stormbreaker is an awesome novel, the start of the series about Alex Rider comes up full of suspense and action! From page one you'll be grabbed by a mystery that must be solved. I usually are more of the fantasy-type of books but this one really charmed me.It has some very exciting scenes and every chapter is tied up with adrenaline-filled cliff hangers. Some parts are hard to go through if you get easily distracted but then the action grabs you again and won't let you go. If you are reluctant about spy novels, read this one and you'll see it's a whole new world full of interesting plots. Can't wait to start reading Point Blank!"
3,The kid who knew too much!,This book is very exiting there is quite a bit of mayhem and mystery. The only problome i could find was with the kid. He knew a lot more then he should have. Still all in all it is a nice spy novel. One for all ages
2,(insert explosion here),"This book is about three/fourths great reading, 1/8 corny, and 1/8 unrealistic. Firstly, Alex is just a tad to perfect. The saftey of England, (GReat Britan, United Kingdom, Britan{without the great}. Comes second to the saftey of myself.I'll complain about the never ending number of random guards the evil man has. This is a common flaw seen in movies. Where do they get all those people? Is there like a warehouse full of people stupid enough to get killed by a teenager? Hmmm...It was an interesting read, that i finished fairly quickly. There is nothing hugely special, but don't pass it up either.I have yet to read the last book ""scopria"" or something.Happy endings are stories that haven't finished yet.-Qoute taken from Mr. +Mrs. Smith"
2,Stormbreaker essay,I didn't think Stormbreaker was very exciting. It is written by Anthony Horowitz who also wrote a book called Gruseome Grange which isn't as good as Harry Potter. I got Grusesome Grange when I was in London on vacation. Stormbreaker is like James Bonf but with a kid as hero. His name is Alex Rider. The story is not very real and I was bored sometimes reading it.
3,"Good, Fast Read","A friend recommended this one. As other reviewers have said, it has a James Bond feel. This was a quick, enjoyable read. The story-line moved along quickly, and it kept my interest. This is in the tradition of Matt Helm or James Bond."
5,Camilla's Review-age 9,"I LOVED this book! I liked all the action. My favorite part was when Alex is in the gold mine. This book is a must-read. I Loved Point Blank (the sequel), too. I can't wait to read The Skeleton Key."
4,Weapon of Mass Destruction,"The book Stormbreaker is a story about a teenage boy named Alex, who finds out his uncle works for a secret spy organization called MI6. When Alex's uncle dies during a mission they now want Alex to take his place and this is where the story takes off.When I read along in the book I realized Alex and I are alike in some ways. Like when he is sneaking around everywhere trying to figure stuff out. This book really captured my interest from the start. It is exciting with action, mystery, and spy parts in the book."
4,Read this book!,"Stormbreaker by Anthony Horowitz is about Alex Rider, a present-day fourteen year old who's uncle died in a mysterious accident in Chelsea, London. Now Alex is recruited by M16 to complete the mission his uncle was unable to accomplish due to his death. He is sent to Sayle Enterprises, run by what seems like a very generous man, Herod Sayle, in order to uncover the truth of the new Stormbreaker computers invented by Herod. After getting past armed guards, riding quads, and being in a giant tank with a deadly creature, Alex will realize what it takes to have heroism, bravery, and hope. I liked this book because of the suspenseful events that made me really care what happens next. The descriptive language allowed me to envision exactly what Alex's surroundings were."
5,Alex Rider! StormBraker!,I made the mistake of reading the 2nd book first. I fell in love with the way the story was told so I then proceeded to getting the book for a school project. Knowing that it was going to be good I dove in reading getting farther and farther in to the plot I got engrossed with the story. This page turning edge of your see book kept me going till the very end. Styles had me wonder what the true plot if his Storm Breaker computer was all about. Alex a 14-year-old boy lost his uncle and found out that he was a MI6 spy. Alex was thrown into a dangerous place the very place his uncle was killed. I am now on the 3rd book and it till keeps me coming back for more this is a must read for any person that enjoys a deep plot many cliffhangers and twist and any one who thought a 14 year old boy can save the world. I give this book 5 stars b/c from start to finish I could not put it down and Point blank the 2nd book is just as good if not better as the first.
4,stormshock,This book was reallt good. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. A little scary and violent though. But besides that it was a grteat book. I recommend it but only if you can take a little nasty stuuff.
3,"High on Action, low on Character Development","Like any other action based novel, the storyline flows very well. The suspense and action will definitly leave readers on the tip of their chairs.However, I found the lack of character development very disapointing.Alex is a 14-year old - who's uncle has been murdered - and still he manages to be so calm about the whole ordeal. It's just unrealistic to have a 14 year old - stay so calm in his first mission with only several weeks of training. I was also disapointed that there was no special insight into Alex's character other than his abilities and skills.It's clichéd, but it's fun to read because of the action.I recommend this book to action lovers. However, if you want developed characters, don't go near this book."
2,Bad characters,"The characters are all woefully underdeveloped, even the hero of the book. The action scenes are passable, but the plot is sloppy. Who decided to publish this amateurish attempt? Here's hoping the author gets better as the books continue. Not that I will be reading them (to my kid). Even for children, life's too short to read bad books; there are too many better ones to switch to."
4,Stormbreaker,"Stormbreaker is an interesting spy novel, ideal for young James Bond fans. Our grade read this book for school, and I found it to be interesting, but not the best written book. The idea of the story is gripping and thrilling, but Anthony Horwitz told the story too fast-paced for a spy novel. I had to read the book twice to understand it completely, but don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it.The book contains some fighting, but isn't positively gory, and is filling for all kids, probably grades 5-8."
5,Stormbraeaker,"O.K, One word-WOW!!! This was the best book I've ever read (Until Point Blank) Anyway, This is sooo good! Alex Rider's Uncle is killed in suspicious circumstances ( His parents died in a plane crash when he was weeks old.) Suddenly he's recruited into MI6 and he's off to the depths of cornwall where Herod Sayle is making new computers called Stombreakers. He pland on giving one free to every school in the country. But Alex thinks that there must be more to the plan than they thought at first."
5,Stormbreaker,"Ian Rider has been leading double life for too long and now it's too late... It's Alex's turn to finish up his work for the MI6. Only Alex can stop the atrocious Herod Sayle from his mysterious plot. But what could it be? Stormbreaker tells the story of Alex Rider's first adventure from the eyes from the fourteen-year-old boy. This novel is set in the remote headquarters of the Stormbreaker manufacturing lab in Cornwall, England. Stormbreaker is followed with more exciting sequels with each more thrilling than the last. Anthony Horowitz has written some amazing works and Stormbreaker is one of them. Its nail-biting suspense just keeps you turning to the last page. Any spy or action book fan will fall in love with this book and the five others that follow. Alex Rider undeniably makes everything more exciting."
5,a good book,"This is just another secret agent book, but now it is a teen. I really liked the book because it was a secret agent type book. My favorite character was Alex because he is the main character and knows karate moves. This book is appropriate to middle school and up because the words are more challenging and there some language. The setting related to the plot and character because he was from Britain and that is where all the action takes place.- Gerald Middy"
4,A action packed story,They told 14 teen year old ALEX that hisuncle had died in a car accident.Buthe knew the truth from the suspcions.fromthe bullet holes in the win shield. Butthen alex find's him self in a game of catand moues that never ends as a young likejames bond!!!
4,Stormbreaker,"This story is about a fourteen year old boy called Alex Rider who has been informed that his uncle Ian has died in a car accident. People say that he was not wearing a seatbelt, but he refuses to believe it. His uncle is very cautious and would not even move the car unless everybody in his car has a seatbelt on. Alex is suspicious because there were bullet holes in the windshield. Alex seeks assistance from the Secret Spy building (MI6) Alexwants to find out who killed his uncle.I would recommend this book to 6th grade and up. I really liked the book and I'm assuming you will too. 192 P"
4,James Bond for the Harry Potter set,"This is the first book in a series of adventures about Alex Rider, a fourteen-year-old reluctant spy. I guess I would call it ""James Bond for the Harry Potter set."" It's very exciting, and the action is quite intense, but the violence is definitely toned-down for kids, and not graphic, which is greatly appreciated by this parent. I also appreciate that there is no ""language."" Refreshing! [I'll never understand why authors insist on using foul language in their books.... it's simply not necessary. I suppose it's merely a sign of bad writing, as if the author can't come up with a better way for a character to express themselves. (It's also true of ""real"" people who use that kind of ""language"".... they sound ignorant and uneducated, not to mention boorish.) It's a cop-out.] So, I was happy to let my 11-year-old son read it, and he loved it, naturally. Actually, so did I.I look forward to reading the next one!Age recommendation: 11 - 16 years"
3,Slow start to a great series,I enjoyed this book but it isn't nearly as good as the books that come later in the series. I am glad i read it and maybe my giving it a 3 star rating is only because i have already read all of the books in the series up to Snakehead. If i had written a review of Stormbreaker before I read any of the other books than i might give it 4 stars. But i am giving it 3 stars because as the series continues it just gets better and better. The first 3 books are all good but i don't think the Alex Rider series really kicks into gear until the 4Th book. And after that it never lets up. This series is a lot of fun for all ages.
2,"Stunningly, shamelessly unoriginal","Stormbreaker is a collage of every spy movie cliche ever, from the Q-style gadget session to the German female assistant of the mad doctor (I kept wanting to call her Frau Farbissina). It even has the old taxi driver turns out to be the bad guy routine! Ouch...this book does absolutely nothing that hasn't already been done to death. Even the kid as secret agent thing has already been done in several Spy Kids movies among others. Watch a few of the poorer Bond films and you could have all it takes to write the next in the series."
2,Bad Advertisement,"While the price was fairly decent for the item I was disapointed when it came in. The sellers advertised that it was 'New' and when I got the book it was worn around the edges and corners and even had writing on the inside cover! Apparently, the book used to belong to 'Rachel'. Other than that, I look forward to reading it."
3,rice man of silver,I thought that this book was okay. It is the story of a kid that becomes a spy for a secret agency. I thought this book was kind of corny. There are so many books like this. It was baiscally the same as all the others with a different storyline.
4,AMAZING!!!,I thought this book was very good and had a wonderful plot. I will definitely read the sequel! Completely recommended by me!
5,Wood Retablo,This item is gorgeous...artwork is beautiful...top quality. A lot of work was put into this piece...it is beautiful and colorful.
5,This saved my sanity!,"I was doing my videos for National Board Certification and to my horror found that my students could not be heard! Audio-Technica to the rescue! With the included adapter, it fit perfectly into the ancient video camera at my school and my problem was solved!"
3,Good for Office or home use.,"The mic works great but it uses a small battery, the quality is great, much better than the one in my mac, and it does not create feedback very easy..."
4,it works,"It is now sometime I've had this product. It works fine. As I got it I was able to use it even from the room next to the mike. As battery goes down, the radius of action decrease accordingly... battery life depends on how long you use it and other conditions. I've already changed battery ones, but I do use this mike quite a bit... I would not call it a major drawback. It works ok and that is what counts."
2,Don't get REFURBISHED,"I purchased this product refurbished from Beach Camera, and within 90 days, it stopped working on any computer or amplifier that I used it with. No sound came in besides a click when I turned the switch on or off, and brief electronic noise when I plugged it in or took it out of the computer.I would suggest that if you are thinking about buying this product, pay at least $25 for a high quality new one."
3,Not a bad omni-directional remote,"My wife is a classroom teacher and needed an omni-directional microphone for the school's video camera for a class project. The range and quality of the audio from this remote were pretty good. Elementary school kids aren't very quiet and so the microphone picked up a fair amount of background noise with a 10-15 foot range. Overall, a fine low-end omni-directional microphone."
2,Not worth the money,I tried this microphone out and it really wasn't worth the money. It recorded with less clarity than uni-directional microphones. And while that is the point of a uni-directional microphone (to dampen out background noise) this seemed to be creating some interferance of its own. I'm sending mine back.
2,Poor quality for this brand name,This mic is surprisingly poor quality for a brand name like Audio-Technica. The sound is distant and thin and basically makes the mic unusable for a speakerphone.
2,"Mac Users, Stay Away","I bought this mic with the intention to use it in an interview. While it does function pretty well when it is about one inch from your mouth, audio quality rapidly degrades any further than that. The audio it picked up at 3 feet had to be amplified beyond reason (everything maximized to get almost normal speech volume), and when I did, the audio quality was worse than what you'd from a cell phone call.Admittedly, I'm using a Mac to test this on, and they have unpowered mic jacks, as opposed to PC's typical powered and unpowered varieties. Since the mic uses a battery, I don't think the lack of a powered jack was the issue, but since I don't have a PC to test it on, I can't say any more than for Mac users to stay away from this product. The microphone built into your Mac is likely far superior.I'm returning this product."
1,BAD Math - buy the single cartridges,"At the time of this posting, this combo 16+26 was $60.04. On the same AMAZON.com site, you can get just a single 16 for $22.82 and a single 26 for $23.94.Buy them both for $46.76 (22.82+23.94).That is $13.28 LESS!So if you want to save money, buy the single cartridges. I guess this an example of BUYER BEWARE.16 (black):Lexmark #16 Black Ink Cartridge (10N0016)26 (color):Lexmark #26 Color Ink Cartridge (10N0026)-"
1,Way Overpriced,I saw this same item at Sam's yesterday for $45... I can't believe these people are asking $70
2,not attractive really,"I think the title attracts people attention. The quality of the photos is average. The pose has nothing special. this is like ordinary photos with your girlfriend, except that they are naked. I don't even find the girls attractive."
1,His wife and mother must be proud,"I have just had it with cheap gimmicks destined for the gutter of the cultural wasteland that Helfrich must live in. I can only assume he has not a moral fiber in his body to first take the pictures, then keep them and finally publish them. What must mom and the wife think? ....real class - NOT.Don't waste your time."
2,An expose of the author's shallowness!,"I purchased this book expecting to get a sense of life and love in the 1970's. What I found instead was a mild titilation in photographs of naked women, and text appropriate to horny teenager. It seems that the author rated the women based on bodily characteristics, rather than any sense of the humanity of these women. It saddens me that he never found the people, only the genitalia. At one point he refuses to forgive a woman who was unfaithful to him, while at the same time he jumped from bed to bed. Another time he laughs at a woman for being shallow, while remaining shallow himself, all through the decade. You can purchase the book for the nudity, but you won't find the romance of the 1970's. That aspect seems to have been disregarded."
3,"Engaging pics, questionable motives","Excellent, evocative photography. However, there are a number of author's comments in this book which are almost mean-spirited and/or over-sexual, and not in keeping with the stated happy-go-lucky semi-innocence of the whole project. More prurient than sweet, in a couple cases. And gratuitous, in one or two cases. Whether the photos and text document real relationships or not (there seems to be some doubt), overall the book doesn't come across as a nostalgiac reflection on youthful friskyness. It seems more like a sleazy Internet photo gallery of ""ex-girlfriends,"" or a collection of photos depicting women who don't suspect they're being written about on a bathroom wall. Not that this inherently makes it bad (or undesirable), but it certainly won't meet the expectations of people looking for good clean naked fun."
2,Flip through this one at the bookstore,"I'd read a review of this book when it first came out, but there was no mention of it being fictitious. When I saw it in a bookstore, I browsed through it and was totally taken in, although a very distant voice in my head made me wonder how the author got permission from a couple of those women for his written comments about them. However I decided to see if I could get a cheaper copy online, and that's when I read that the pictures were recent and the stories fictional. If the book is indeed a hoax, then there is really no point in buying it if you're on any kind of book-budget at all. The pictures aren't particularly good because they are designed to mimic snapshots. And the stories, if fictional, are irrelevant."
2,"You've read the New Yorker, right?","This book is not, in fact, candid photos of ex girlfriends, but is actually posed photographs. That's fine, but I think buyers should know that Mark Helfrich was a child during the 70's, so even his claim that all this sexual experimention could have taken place in the 1970's is, well, you know, puffed up. (I know, I actually dated him.)"
1,Fake - be aware,Just a couple of words - this is a total fake! The photographer made us believe for months that these were really his girlfriends - bullshit - he finally came out and told the truth - the girls are all models. What dishonesty in the name of making better sales.
1,Truth is Lamer than Fiction!,"I looked at this book and recognized a woman I know immediately. Gosh, the only problem is that she's in her late twenties...therefore NOT a 1970's ex-girlfriend of Mark Helfrich's. That made me wonder about the whole project. Not that there would be anything wrong with a series of short vignettes coupled with photos of models...but Helfrich presents this as something else. Then I read the definitive take on this in the New Yorker. Debate over, people. These are professional models. A true title for this book might be ""Stories About My Ex-Girlfriends, With Naked Pictures of Professional Models."" Hmmm. Might not sell so well, then, would it? Especially because the stories are kind of shallow and self-aggrandizing. National Lampoon did a feature like this years ago that was much, much better. And we all knew it was a joke."
5,"What a gem of a book! Smart and innocent, yet sexy !","What a beautiful book. I don't care what the last reviewer thinks or what has politically motivated him or her- this book is purely an entertaining and moving glimpse into one man's sexual experience. I would buy this book again as a gift not because I choose to peek into the true history of this man, but rather to own a delightful collection of short stories with relaxed and charming snapshots. My copy gets handled by most of the people that come through my apartment and illicits laughter and discussion every time.. now, no one can say there's anything wrong with that!"
2,Lewdicrous.,"Assuming this is a hoax, two stars for being clever. These pictures are dull enough to be real, however."
4,the book is good if it is real,"i bought this book and really liked it. the photographs are well taken, and i like the little side-notes. unfortunately, after i bought the book, i found out that the women in the pictures are not really his ex-girlfriends, as he claims them to be. i was upset when i read this, and it gives the book a whole other meaning. if the book really was him documenting his love life, then i love it! if the book is just a ploy to get sales, i like it for the art, but the author could have noted that the women are models."
1,The subtitles are invisible much of the time,"The subtitles are invisible much of the time because they are all-white (with no frames around the letters), so they become invisible against the background. (The movies in itself is amusing, with excellent acting.)"
5,I always liked 'em so much,"I have been listening to Los for a few years now and this disc sums up everything they stand for. Recorded live at the Club Foothill aki Long Beach, Cal. this is vintage surf that tickles you in places that you don't dare reach for anymore. I've seen them live twice now. I'd see them more but the guys don't drop by too often. The qaulity of production is out of sight!!! Buy this disc first, then get all the rest."
4,Too small by half. . .,"The color plates are worth the price of the book. The only thing wrong with it is its size: IT SHOULD BE 500 PAGES LONG AND AT LEAST 8 1/2 x 11! There is no work of art shown in this book that I would not put on my own walls--and I'm usually a ""stop at the Impressionists"" consumer. I'm constantly trying to learn more about Nebraska, since I left there as a young person seeking work. These artists pull me back. I particularly like ""Standing Farmers"" (LaDell Routh Stonecipher) for its connection to the professional essay on overalls that appeared in DESIGN, a college writing text. [James Agee? ""Overalls""?]"
3,"Just okay, cleaned some","I have nubuck walking shoes. I was hoping this stuff would clean some of the spots off the leather and it did, just not all the spots. I used the entire container on two shoes. I think for the price, any other (cheaper) cleaner would have done just as good a job. I was not impressed."
