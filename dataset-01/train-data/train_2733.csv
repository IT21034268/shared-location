5,really good,"Kinkade's 2 books are fantastic, the best I've ever read, of any animal communicator books. Neat stories, methods that are set up in a useful sequence, this is really good."
4,I like it,"So far it's great. I like how she says that your intuition is just like any other skill. It has to be developed. She says its like riding a bicycle. You don't know how at first but you practice and before you know it, it's instinctual. You do it without really thinking about it. Same goes for intuition. Practice, and soon you will be able to talk to your animal without a problem.I have not made success at it yet, because I just bought it. I have always loved the concept of animal communication and am eager to try it.My family has a dog and I want to be able to know what is going on inside her head. Somehow, I get the feeling that she is trying to talk to me and I just don't understand. And I want to understand."
2,"somebody needs to rain on this parade, fire hydrant style!","I suppose I ought to have paid more attention before ordering this book to the reviews to understand the tenor of it. I got it as a gift for a dog mad friend, but then perusing the back cover realized it might be a little too crazy for him, or me, so I decided the best thing to do was to crack it open before giving it to him.This book is really for people who are ready to believe just about anything, if you have any critical faculty whatsoever, this book is not for you! It's not only about communicating with animals IT'S ALSO ABOUT COMMUNICATING WITH DEAD ANIMALS AND DEAD PEOPLE AND DEAD PEOPLE'S ANIMALS AND DEAD ANIMAL'S PEOPLES etc. I mean, basically, it's off the wall! And FLUFFY GETS CANCER ONLY TO MAKE HER MISTRESS GIVE UP HER BAD BOYFRIEND!!! I mean, it's out there!I give it 2 stars cause it's not as though reading some of it isn't amusing but to read all of it? No way!!"
2,Doesn't hold charge,"The instructions say to crank for one minute and then press the light button. There was the faintest glow and then nothing. I tried cranking for three minutes. Nothing. I pulled out the second flashlight and cranked for one minute. No light. Now, they will give off light if you crank while it's in a light mode, but that takes two hands. I really just wanted something to light my path on the one block from the bus stop, so I didn't bother trying to return them for a second set. Besides, if both didn't hold a charge, it seems none will."
1,2 Thumbs DOWN,"2 Thumbs DOWN based on 2 criteria:Price; This filter cost $8.45 + $6.95 S&H; = $15.40An OEM filter from Lasko cost $4.95 + $1.95 = $6.90FILTER MEDIUMThis filter is the correct size, however the filter medium is different from the OEM filter medium. This filter, when wet & not dripping held 13.5 oz of waterThe Lasko OEM filter held 16.25 oz of water when wet & not dripping.I'm assuming the filter that holds the most water is going to put out more humid moisture into the air. I believe this filter will limit & or restrict the efficiency of the Lasko Model 1128Advertising on the box proclaims this filter as 150% More Strength.....compared to what? What does ""strength"" have to do with filters?The advertising also proclaims ""EXTENDED LIFE""....compared to what?"
1,PURE GARBAGE!,"These are generic filters, the dimensions of the filter are correct to fit into the holder but they are not as THICK. These filters do not seem to give up the water as easily as the original Lasko filter that came with my humidifier.Stay away from these ones and buy only the original Lasko filters..."
1,Get the original,"This is an aftermarket filter. It is slightly smaller and much less substantial (less filter material) than the factory filter. I'm also dubious about the quality of the antimicrobial agent, since it started to smell and picked up a yellow growth after just a few weeks. I bought this here because of the convenience and free shipping with my prime account, but will be ordering direct from Lasko next fall when I need the humidifier again."
5,Filters at half the price when ordered direct from Lasko.,I agree this is a top quality humidifier and since I live in a very dry desert mountain area it is the best I have found. I went through several of the smaller humidifiers you can buy at any store but they all developed problems within a 2 to 5 month time period. This one is easy to fill and to maintain. It gets quieter as it is used. I highly recommend it. I bought it through Amazon and the price was reasonable. Extra filters I will order from the manufacturer.
2,Not as good as other covers,"I bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same. Other covers I've seen just slip on, this one has to be tied on. Also, it doesn't cover the entire cart. There is an opening, that my baby's fingers always find, where he can touch the icky cart handle. Not a great product. Spend the extra money and buy the better one."
2,Definitely too small for most shopping carts,You don't want this one. Although the fabric is appealing (calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers) this cover will not fit most shopping carts. It only fits the carts found at small city super markets. If you are a suburbian shopper you'll have to spend the bucks for a more satisfactory product.
1,An absurd product,"I bought this product because I liked the price, the gender-neutral appearance, and the shoulder straps. Unfortunately, I did not look closely enough at the picture on the front of the package, or I would have discovered that the side panels on this product do not cover shopping carts adequately. The first time I set my baby in this, s/he tilted over to the side and started mouthing the exposed shopping cart! Isn't that the entire point of buying this product--to keep babies from mouthing the shopping cart? Whoever designed this obviously does not have a baby. However, I accept some of the blame for making a careless purchase because, as I mentioned, the picture on the package clearly shows the product's shortcomings.I returned it and bought the Infantino savvy seat (not the Jr. model) instead. It was twice the price, but at least it does its job."
2,Coverage isn't good,"Unfortunately, I'm here on Amazon looking for a new shopping cart cover because this one doesn't adequately do the job. The front doesn't fit the new carts with drink holders, and side coverage isn't adequate-- my daughter can touch and mouth the side of the cart, and can reach behind her and get to the rest of the cart with ease. Disappointing."
2,Disappointed in product,I would not recommend this product. It is not easy to use and does not fit well in most shopping carts I have tried. You have to tie the cover onto the cart which is difficult to do while holding your baby. It is also suppose to roll itself up into it's own built in storage bag which I have not been able to do right on the first try yet. There is also no padding what so ever in the cover and the harness system is a joke because my baby can still lean all the way forward to the cart handle.
2,Frustrating,I registered for this product at Target and recieved it as a shower gift. I was frustrated to find that my little monkey can get her hands around the cover onto the cart at nearly every store I go to. It does not cover all of an average sized cart (still have to carry and use wipes on the cart) and doesn't even fit the carts at Target where it came from! What worries me the most is that my child is not seat belted to the cart itself. She is starting to squirm and wriggle so much that the simple cloth ties and the harness will not hold her in the seat much longer. I am now looking for a cover that has holes in the back where I can thread through the cart's own belt (after I clean it of course!!)
3,"Excellent sound, but an old technology","I bought this HT 10 days ago. I was imppressed by the sound. Incredible sub-woofer. A lot of control over the audio, BUT...- I cound't play my MP3s. Strange sounds and ""jumps"". I tried different Panasonic in the store, and it is always the same. It's a problem with the model. Don't buy it if you want to play Mp3's with your Home Theater.- Horrible interfase (GUI). Tiny icons on the screen.- When you try to change from one disk to another it takes a l[o]t of time.Finally, I changed the Panasonic for a Sony DAV C-770. It is SO... cool!"
2,"Awesome sound, but DVD function broke after 2 years","Other reviews are right: It takes about 2 years before the DVD player malfunctions. Ours did last night, after purchasing it in Oct 2002. We're looking at significant repair costs. Awesome sound is N/A if you can't enjoy the main function of the unit (video)."
3,Mp3 skips,"Overall, this seems like a nice unit, but I have the same trouble as Gustavo... weird ""jumps"" in MP3's, which would be a show-stopper if it didn't have a 5-disc changer."
4,Works great...especially for price,"I read over the other reviews prior to buying this product. One mentioned a humming sound. I heard the same thing, but only because I was looking for it. My wife didn't notice it at all. You can only really hear it when there is a lull in the sound while watching a DVD. Doesn't bother me enough to return it.For the money this system is excellent...progressive scan, lots of power, and easy setup.For [the price], it's hard to beat!"
2,A modular system is better than buying an all-in-one box.,"My Panasonic worked very well for me for 2 years and then its DVD player suddenly stopped functioning. When we took it to the authorized Panasonic repair center, the technician told us that a DSP IC board needed to be replaced and that it would cost $570--more than double the original price! He told us frankly that these systems are _expected_ to break down in 2 years and it's extremely difficult and expensive to buy genuine replacement parts for them. He suggested that I should get a separate home theater receiver and an inexpensive DVD player.I bought a Yamaha YHT-100 and it sounded so much better than this Panasonic ever did."
3,It's okay!,"This series of make-it-yourself toys is just fun. This particular one is kind of funny and I'm glad I got it, but to be honest, the amount of work it takes to put it together is not worth the very little action one gets while turning the crank when it is finished."
3,Angels in the Outfield & Infield,"This is an entertaining film. It is fun to watch and can be watched as a family. I think it is good, but I wouldn't watch it more than about once a year."
5,angels in the outfield,good childrens flick. i bought for grand kids. they enjoyed! thaT's what counts word word word word word word word
5,Excellent book if you are new to JAVA,I have never read a technical book that is actually written in an easy to read style. There are loads of examples in here which should get you off the ground and into Java. I am personally using this book as a basis to study for the Sun Java Exams. This is deffinately worth it's weight in Gold.
3,There Are Better Books,"This is an okay book, but not one of the best programming books I've read. It is not well organized and the index isn't very comprehensive. If you are looking to use AWT, this book only lightly overviews some of the widgets. Also, some of the examples in the book already use deprecated API's."
4,Good but still a little complex,Overall a good book with clear explanations but it relies heavily upon the fact that the reader has some knowledge of programming beforehand.
1,Mis-leading Product Discription,"The product description specifically states ""installs inside the window channel with 3m tape, once I received it, it was not the ""in-channel"" one but this one actually sticks on the outside of the door. Returned it, looking for the ""in-channel"" ones."
5,Beats letting in the rain,"Keeps the rain out. Allows fresh air in. Well made. Easy install. Holds up well.And they stand behind their product, no problem."
3,May help blades to rust...,"Blades will ""sweat"" after skating. These guards have no way to absorb water that will condense on the blades. If you just slap these on after skating and put the skates away, the blades will rust. I have since bought myself and my daughter an absorbant cloth skate guard and like them a lot better than these."
4,"Nice bag, good quality... Go Ducks!","I was surprised at how thick this bag is. I will say that it is probably a little expensive, but what collegiate stuff isn't... Good quality, good color and the logo looks great. If I lived in Oregon I might try to find one closer to home to save the shipping, but the product is good and I couldn't get to Oregon anytime soon. Fun bag to tote my books around in."
4,PC holder,"Very nice, heavy duty bracket. My only whine is that once the pc is placed in it, two people are needed to raise or lower it with the tab system that is used to hold it in place.Never-the-less it is well worth the money!"
5,Life as a Medical Missionary,"A highly entertaining and informative account of years spent by the author and his family at a remote village in Nepal, where he and his wife served as doctors in a small mission hospital. The humor and frustrations of adjusting to life in a poor country without most of the things we take for granted in the U.S."
1,The utmost in self-righteousness,"If there were a ""zero"" or a minus grade I could give this book, I would. The title sounded so intriguing but turned out to be nothing but a cheap ploy to attract potential buyers. The flora and fauna of Nepal do not feature in the book. The author, a ""Christian"" missionary physician, did not bother to study Hindu culture before going to Nepal and so commits serious offenses against the local population and their beliefs. He seems to feel no love whatsoever for the people he is claiming to take care of but expects them to say ""thank you"" at every turn. He looks at them and treats them with an attitude of condescension, smugness, and arrogance. In spite of being a physician, he turns down the patients that need him most desperately. I was outraged!!! He is one of the people that give Christians and missionaries in general a bad name."
2,Disappointed,I order the Borg-Warner D734 Rotor and got something similar to it and it does not fit for my 97 Mitsubishi Mirage.
5,Magical,"This book was inspired by a Safari to Kenya and Tanzania. I was part of the group that travelled with Ms. Ichikawa to Africa. The beauty of the land, the warmth of the people, and the magic of the wildlife is all recreated here... of course, in a simplified manner that makes it accessible to children of all ages. The First Bear in Africa is a story of two children learning about each other's culture. Since there are no bears in Africa, this additional clever twist adds another layer to a wonderful story. Thank you, Ms. Ichikawa, for a magical memory of an incredible adventure."
5,What a treasure!,"I don't remember how I was referred to this book, but I am so glad we read it. The story is very well-written, engaging even for my 2 and 4 year old children.The story is written in first person, told from the perspective of an African child, whose family lives on the savannah plains. Some caucasian tourists come for a visit, and the young girl forgets her teddy bear. Meto, the young boy, then has quite an adventure as he runs across the savannah, trying to catch up to the girl and return her animal to her.This book is an absolute must to parents or teachers of young children (ages 4-8 in particular). We are honored to have shared the story together. We especially enjoyed learning the Swahili words for ""Goodbye"" and for various savannah animals."
1,Not worth the package it comes in,"I've had good luck with older Shockwave models so I dont know what happened with this disaster. I use the shockwaves because I run while listening to CDs. The older models (sw860) worked fine unless I dropped them a few times. THIS model does not work at all while running. This CD unit is so intolerant to motion, it actually shut off after skipping endlessly while I was running. The anti-skip system is automatically activated, according to the instructions, so it wasnt my error. It works fine if Im still... [...].The headphones also sound lousy and the radios tuning mode is very non-intuitive. What a mess. Where did Panasonic go wrong?"
4,If interested in Lincoln should read this book,"I read this book online (it's in the public domain), so I cannot comment on the other parts of the book that may be unique to this edition. But the actual portion written by Dittenhoefer gives a really good account of what happened during campaigns. He touches on everything from Douglas debates to rivals running in the 64 election. It doesn't go into depth on anything, but if you're familiar with Lincoln during this period, it makes for an interesting read by someone who saw it first-hand.Makes for a good gift for a Lincoln fan. And if you're that fan, then I recommend this as casual light reading you can easily read in a day."
5,THEIR BEST ALBUM - and thats saying something!,"This is a really solid album. Very tight sounding with great songs. Like a more poppy Ramones, with a but of spice thrown in. This band has gotten better over the years as players and writers. Forget their cult status, this is just a plain old really great rock/pop album."
4,finally!,"finally, a diana movie done somewhat right. They actually had a good actress to portray diana. very haunting actually because her characteristics in the movie were just like Diana. I wish the movie kept going without the documentary style but overall the movie is pretty good and gives you a sense of the last day."
5,Kensington ware,"I love this book. I am originally from New Kensington, PA and my father worked for Alcoa and we have quite a bit of the Kensington ware that is shown in this book. I really loved finding out more about it. My dad would have enjoyed seeing this and reading it. My brother and I are having fun finding our ""treasures"" that our parents left us. Nice book, good pictures and very informative."
5,Informative withgreat photos,"Nice source of information about the Kensington aluminum line of products. Pricing may be a bit off, depends upon region, I suppose, and whatever folks are willing to pay / charge for items."
4,everyone...read this book,"I really enjoyed the book,and I recomend it to everyone.It's on of those books that when you start it,you have to finish it. you can't put it down.congrats on your first book Jacq.Really enjoyed it,and I'm ready for the second one."
3,Decent into deception?,The author of this book wrote the Forward to Alien Encounters by Chuck Missler and Mark Eastman.In effect he came to believe that the New Age agenda was a deception by less than beneficent beings.It may be worth paying attention when the Captain jumps ship and climbs aboard the enemy flagship.
4,satisfied,This book came in very good condition. I haven't had a chance to read it yet but I am sure it will have good information.
4,GOOD...... but NO HOOD,"This raingear is very light and compact, easy to store and carry. It offers good protection from the weather and provides good breathing. I gave it a 4 stars review because it does not have a hood."
4,Works great,I've used these at two different companies and they always worked great. Having one at home makes working from home great especially when using a KVM with your home PC.Occasionally I'll see PS2 mice that have trouble working with these. Going with a newer PS2 or USB mouse solves this problem.
4,Thinkpad Port Replicator,"This is working like a charm. I can just leave everything plugged in and take my laptop where ever. When I return, I only have to dock. No more changing cords."
4,pretty good,"Hi all, this video is pretty good and the asanas are excellent for us gals that are oh-so-swelling with life. Easy on the sensitive areas, doesnt uncomfortably squish baby or bladder, and provides some much needed relaxation and stretching. I have a feeling this is a valuable tool in my labor and delivery aresenal, as I feel the exercises really do open up the hips and help get the baby in proper birthing position. Try it, especially if you don't mind a little chanting with your yoga!"
2,Worst Yoga Video I've Ever Seen,"The production quality was amazingly shoddy - the soundtrack popped and the volume jumped at odd moments. I could barely listen to the chanting sections - ouch! And why all the panning shots of the bleak brick wall behind them?Worse than that, though, I had little confidence in the instructor's knowledge. Some of the directions she gave were in direct contrast to ones I heard from other Yoga teachers - all that bouncing on the joints and tendons seemed like a bad idea, so I just held the poses and breathed. The ""relaxation"" section, which I assume was supposed to stand in for Shivasana, lasted 5 seconds! Also, there was no discussion at all about Kundalini Yoga - the instruction did include some chanting and translation of the Sanskrit, but a very sketchy explanation of what the point was of saying it.I would not recommend this DVD at all. It just made me feel confused and self conscious. You can find a better one. I guarantee it!"
2,not so pleased,I was really looking forward to this DVD and then it came in the mail. The main yoga instructor is not pregnant so for me personally that made it a little less appealing and then the whole thing is shot on a ugly set in front of a brick wall. Not very soothing scenery at all. I have no comment on the exercises as I haven't even tried them yet. I just didn't want to sit in front of a screen watching a such an ugly set for an hour.
5,Complex material made clear an easily understandable,"I have practically worn out this tape listening to it over an over again. It gave me a great deal of information about Hildegard and made me hungry to know more about this medieval phenomenon. I like the way the author presents what could be very complex material in an easy and understandable way. Her voice is unobtrusive and lets me concentrate on the content. Flute interludes put me in a relaxed state of mind. I would without question recommend this tape to anyone who wants a basic introduction to Hildegard, and her world."
4,John has got to be one of the great jazz pianist of all time,"I first discovered John playing the piano on one of my ScottHamilton cds. As time went by, I started checking out John andhis accomplishments. Wow! the man has a resume that won't stop.For six years he was Tony Bennetts' pianist and band leader. Thatalone is an amazing thing.John was around 55 when he got his first studio gig. That wasmuch too late. He should have been recording much earlier in his career.John has played with many different artists. He has a good list of cds that he has either been the leader of or been a valueablecontributor to.This cd Tony's Tunes finds John in top form. He really played his heart out with each tune. The only reason for not bringingout the five stars for this cd was the repertoire. Some of the songs performed, I didn't particularly like."
4,Perfect Dark Book,Great SCI-FI book which makes the video game more enjoyable to play when you know more about the background.
2,Only for low current devices,"Do not believe the misleading advertising that this is suitable for 'portable coolers'. When a cooler drawing 4 Amps is plugged into this converter it shuts down and won't pass current.At least it didn't melt (like the 12 volt Y adapter did)!I've kept it because it's handy for PDAs and cell phones. However, don't expect to use it with portable coolers and compressors etc. Stick to the more expensive and puropse built converters for those jobs."
2,There are Better Options,"I ordered Peterson's at the same time I ordered the Bear's Guide on distance degrees. I should have stuck with the latter and saved a significant chunk of change. While Peterson's is larger, that is only useful if you plan to use it as a booster seat or door stop.Peterson's fails to provide key information such as identifying 'degree mill' schools whose diplomas are worthless. It also leaves out accredited schools in other parts of the world, which seem to be viable options, at least based on my research. Petersen is especially weak in graduate degrees outside MBAs or MEds, or the usual Capella, Regent, U of Pheonix, Walden expensive options.Virtually all of the information in this publication can be found for free on the Internet - an option I suggest along with the Bear's guide!"
2,Should be more comprehensive for the price,A more comprehensive book on this topic is Campus Free College Degrees: Thorsons Guide to Accredited College Degrees Through Distance Learning by Marcie K. Thorson. See my review.
2,Chateau Oh No!,"Do not spend money to watch this movie. It lacks a compelling script, employs minimally competent actors, and has a painful soundtrack. Watch Sideways instead. (And I like rom-coms. Seriously.)"
1,Dont waste your time,I didnt like it. It was boring and it just seemed the girl in the movie is immature. She finds her father left her a wine vineyard to look after. She doesn't know the first thing about it. She meets a guy through deception kept the fact that he was her own competition. Everything just goes too fast for what is expected in the real world. They fall in love too fast. I didn't even finish the movie.
1,Poor acting,I love the wine country and I was hoping this movie would be like Sideways ....but it was nothing close. The actors and actresses act so fake. I couldn't even finish the movie. I turned it off after 40 minutes.
1,"Blah, blah, blah...","I had high hopes for this movie, but frankly it fell flat. The plot was tired, the romantic chemistry was lacking and quite frankly I thought that Christopher Lloyd would have made a better evil cartoon character than winemaker his acting was so over the top. The actual film making was decent, and Sokoloff and Righetti had good banter as friends- that 's about all that's positive here.Move on to greener pastures folks...nothing to see here."
2,Just bad,"Had the potential to be cute, but just fell flat. The characters weren't very likable (which they need to be in a cutesy rom-com) or interesting. If you know anything about wine, this movie will frustrate you. They passed a Chardonnay off as a red wine. Come on, if you're going to make a movie set at a winery, at least get the basics right. Out-takes at the end were funny, though. Not a terrible movie, just not well thought-out or well written."
1,The Chateau Meroux,Most amateurish movie I've ever seen. I had an awfully hard time sitting through it. For a rental fee of $3.99 I would expect something better.
3,Lighthearted,"It had a cute story line. But I loved the vineyards, they were beautiful. Just a fun, lighthearted movie. Puts you in a good mood. It is nice to see a woman be courageous enough to take on such a big task."
1,Terrible movie,"I Couldn't get past the bad acting, and the awkward sexual jokes and inuendos. Don't waste your time renting it."
3,Sweet Romantic Comedy,"Picture ""Working Girl"" and move it to the wine country and what you have is a charming romantic comedy that will not disappoint. Both Mr. Watson and Ms. Sokolff do a wonderful job of bringing their characters to life, although you will believe Ms. Sokolff's innocence more than you will Mr. Watson's business savy."
2,would rather watch commercials,"The title had potential, the movie was too goofy to even watch to the end. I give it an ""Ew""."
5,"Yes its not as glam as there old stuff, but yes its amazing!","This cd, unlike the Vault which was a greatest hits sorta thing, they made this assortment of hits, that sound punkier then there usual glam stuff, but it still sounds glam, and its amazing, so i'd reccomend it to anyone that loves glam punk rock. However they should have made it into an album like they did with Tonight Belongs to the Young."
1,"Please do yourself a favor, don't buy this book!","Upon closer inspection, I believe the reviews were rigged.The feedbacks look awful suspicious. Note that no positive reviews have have an identity, it just says ""a reader"". Secondly, the reviews have almost nothing to do with the contents of the book itself. The reviews are most likely an ""advertising"" ploy. Third, is the unusually high, ""so and so found the review helpful"" ratings. If you see my other review, you can see it is a bit more objective than the other reviews. I should have given a lower rating. I can't believe I was tricked into buying this book!"
2,Very poor service,"I orderd this item on November 19th. When I discovered December 17th that it would not be delivered by Christmas as I had ordered it as a gift for my niece, I tried to cancel the order. All I received were error messages. After contacting customer service and multiple delays in responses, I found out that the item was being prepared for shipping and could not be canceled. The order still did not get shipped until December 21st and was not delivered until December 30th. Per instruction from customer service, I refused delivery on the item and am still waiting for a refund (3 weeks after I tried to cancel the order).The pans were okay but the ""recipe booklet"" is just a tiny brochure. I would recommend getting pans designed for a toaster oven instead if you are looking for small baking pans for a child."
3,average stuff,"Average stuff here. As one of the thinnest S31 books out, ""Abyss"" ends quickly and isn't worth the price. Maybe at 3 or 4 bucks it'd be okay. As one person put it, ""Abyss"" has a weak plot that you really don't care about, and its resolution is unimpressive. Nearly a third of the book is spent setting up the mission Bashir, Dax, and Ro must go on. The rest mostly has the characters talking about what they're gonna do, then they spend the few last pages doing it.. and you don't really get into it. What shines is the character development as Bashir deals with S31's latest offer. but that's about it. Bummer."
4,A Good Read About a Heavy Subject,"Having been a fan of Star Trek since the original TV series, I have to admit that one of the things I enjoyed about the series was that it usually showed off the best side of the human race. This series defintely shows the darker side. I like to see Trek books that feature different characters and their personal thoughts and feelings. Julian Bashir has always has a difficult time with his ""special gifts"" and it is easy to imagine his frustration at having then exploited for a shadow organization that appears to answer to no one. You need to be familiar with the cast of DS9 to really understand the history of the Dax symbiont and Julian's relationship with its current host.The Section 31 series is definitely the Trek way of getting us to look at society's ills. Is this what happens when we give up some personal freedom to feel safe?"
3,Not Everything I Might Have Hoped For,"This third installment in a quartet of short novels has its pros and cons. Each of the four novels focuses on a different Star Trek television series. Abyss features the characters from Deep Space Nine. I wouldn't call this a great novel, but as with the TV show on which it is based, it touches on many profound ideas. Topics explored (or at least glanced at) include genetic manipulation, cloning, slavery, war, and spirituality. I think fans of DS9 will find the story at least somewhat entertaining in context; However, I doubt that this book would win new readers to the Trek Universe.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
5,Uplifting Mood Changing.......,I picked up this CD at one of those listening posts a few years ago and I have never tired of it. It is awesome and so well done. Every track is excellent. It is a beautiful combination of native american music and piano that is captivating and never tiring. I only wish that Paul La Roche had made other CDs. Maybe someday. This is a must have.
2,picture,My husband had seen this photo and wanted it for his office. I was very disappointed when I recieved it. It looked like it was a photo of the original photo. Faded not clear. Would not recommend it. Was not worth what i paid for it.
4,Great Juicer,"Great pulp collection system compared to other juicers I've used in the past; easy to remove and clean. Pulp is relatively dry; i.e., most of the juice is extracted from the fruits and vegetables. I didn't give this one five stars because one of the parts has a sharp edge and care must be taken if hand washing."
2,Too much lost juice,The juicer does not extract enough juice from the pulp of the fruit before it ejects it. I put a hand full of grapes into the jucier and got 1/4 cup of juice. I squeezed the pulp it ejcted by using cheese cloth and got over a cup..More juice in the pulp than in the catch basin.I will look for another jucer as soon as I can.
3,Does the job but...,"Does what it's supposed to but this thing is a monster. Big and bulky (and expensive), I think I would have been much more satisfied with a blender."
4,Powerful Juicer,"This juicer is great. I bought this after I managed to destroy my Jack Lalane juicer (white plastic one). This is a very powerful juicer, which means it also is a little loud. It has 3 speeds which is nice to be able to control. I don't mind the noise too much as it juices quickly. Sometimes though it seems really loud.Clean up is a breeze. I just find that the pulp that comes out of this juicer is a little more wet than the Jack Lalane one. This definitely seems to be better built and I think I will be able to use this one for years to come.The locks are a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you should be fine."
1,Juiceman JM503 Pro-3 Speed Juice Extractor DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON,"We purchased this from Amazon and used it almost every day for three months according to manufacturer's instructions, and then one day for no apparent reason the switch stopped working and it would not turn on. I called Juiceman and they offered to replace the unit and agreed to waive the shipping and handling cost, but even so, we were without a working juicer for 2 weeks which is how long it took to replace it. Juiceman said they were not sure but maybe Amazon may have sent us an old or refurbished unit.Juiceman JM503 Juiceman Pro 3-Speed Juice Extractor"
2,Bought 3 for xmas presents 2009..lasted 4 months,I bought 3 of these for Christmas Presents . One of them (my daughters ) had a problem last month..Not starting..like there was a short.Then last night went to use ours..and wouldn't start...used diff. plugs in walls...to no avail...the warranty has to be more than 4 months I would hope...Off course at christmas all the boxes were thrown away..Trying to get ahold of Amazon to REPLACE OURS..WOULD LUV TO HEAR IF ANYONE ELSE IS HAVING PROBLEMS W/ THIS JUICER..WE HAD A PERFECTLY LADY JUICEMAN..STEEL ...GAVE IT AWAY FOR THIS NEW ONE...WISH WE KEPT IT NOW...The 3rd one my son got and so far no problem with his.
1,sorry I bought this juicer,"I just got my juicer a few weeks ago. I liked the way it worked and the pulp seemed to be quite dry meaning the juice was exctracted. The blade component is not easy to get clean so I found that a soft toothbrush works well. I was happy with the purchase so I tossed all the paper work. Yesterday, the digital button would not go on. I played with it for a while and finally got it to turn on.Today the same thing. The machine will not turn on. I have tried everything and now I will have to figure out how to return this since there is something work with the electrical component.This juicer is just completely dead and it is not even a month old."
3,asked too much,I was looking to upgrade my Dell 4550 to use a Blu-ray player and the combination of this card and my old computer couldn't do the job. I don't know if this card works or not.
1,LJ,"I have used this graphic card, for almost two months, without a problem. Delivery time was great, two business days. It does exactly what the say it will do, the 512 memory is a great selling point. However, most games at this time to not require it. I have and older computer and was so glad to find an AGP card at this cost. However, because of my computer, and the games I play, it still was not fast enough for me. I have ordered a BFG Ge Force 7800GSOC AGP card, if that does not do it; guess nothing will."
5,Fun!,"I had so much fun with this camera. Until it broke. You pull a string to advance the film and the string must have disconnected from something inside the camera. However, that didn't happen until years and years after I bought the thing so I still got a lot of fun use of the camera. The shots are really cool looking. There is a certain amount of guessing involved. I would take this on vacation along with my regular camera so for fun side shots. You can also take cool self portraits. This would make a great gift! Yes, it's plastic and it might break on you someday. Most things will. I could probably take it to the lomography store to get fixed but I'm lazy and don't do much with film anymore. People at that company are really nice."
3,becareful with this camera.......,I really like this product and the images it gave me for the first roll but after that everything started malfuctioning. I'd like to return it for another one because I think it's still worth having.warning if you get this product treat it with the upmost care and caution it is very sensitive
4,Servicing battery is a pain,"I have to concur with the review about servicing the battery. It must, or really should, be changed at a Luminox certified service center. The problem with this ... there were maybe two (2) at last count.If you have the battery replaced anywhere else they cannot guarantee that the watch will remain waterproof (and it voids the warranty). This is an issue for a ""dive"" watch!I love the Luminox watches, I own five total, this watch included. But, because the battery change is a hassle, I rate them 4 **** stars, on a true five star watch."
4,finding flaws in paintings,"Great for disclosing work that has been done on paintings - overpaint, tears, other flaws, etc. Handy at small size, easy to carry to an auction or through a gallery."
4,Good (but not perfect) Longwave UV Flashlight,"I purchased one of these Inova X5 ultraviolet flashlights for use with fluorescent minerals, and with the understanding that this is a longwave UV source (more minerals fluoresce under shortwave UV than longwave). Pros: small; lightweight; virtually indestructible; throws out an enormous amount of longwave UV radiation -- enough to cause fluorescence in objects across the room; batteries last a very long time due to low power consumption of LEDs. Con: the unit also throws out a significant amount of visible, lavender, light -- enough to overshadow items with weak fluorescence. Still, this is a very handy light to take to mineral shows/dealers since the UV is strong enough to observe fluorescence even when the room lights are on. Overall pleased with the light, but wish a filter could be attached to reduce the amount of visible light."
4,Useful light,"I have had several flashlights from Inova. I was particularly interested in this one because it has a UV beam. Like other Inova flashlights, this light is durable, well-built and performs as described. The finish is great and looks well made. The UV light is good for finding pet stains, AC leaks, oil leaks, scorpions. It is small and compact. It does pick up a number of things that glow in UV; however, it does not pick up everything that it should. It may be that the UV wavelenght is not right or that there is some visible light that is overshadowing the UV."
2,"Do not waste your money, if you are new to illustrator","If you are trying to learn illustrator for the first time, you better find another book. This book will make your valuable time wasted a lot. It was very painful for me to figure out the steps shown. If you are experienced illustrator user, that might be different story, but, as a beginner, I say 'do not waste your money and time'."
3,"NOT, for ammo! )o:","First, the ad states ""an overmolded handle""...mine does NOT have that feature!The plastic was not blended well and has streaks of muliple colors over the whole box. This is definately not a good box for ammo storage! Not strong enough and if you did fill it, you wouldn't be able to lift it, nor would the handle be strong enough.I'll stick with the military surplus ammo cans!It was my mistake to buy it... will give it to my neighbor for a sewing kit.Great delivery from Amazon but, the ad should be cleaned up!"
5,Great Case -----Tool Box !!!!,"I bought this case to use as a tool box, as it is waterproof and I needed a tool box I can leave out in the rain without my tools getting rusty. This did the trick and it is built to take a beating, unlike alot of tool boxes that you can buy and they fall apart within a week, and those were rather expensive... And with Amazon's discount pricing and Free Shipping (second day air free if your an amazon prime member) you cannot beat it, so just buy it !!!"
5,YES!,I was told about this book a few years ago and bought it as soon as I found it. This is one of the best books that I have EVER read!
3,I'm a little skeptical.,"An enjoyable mystery, but if the detective is going to be that gullible, it's hard to imagine he'd actually be employed by the police."
4,funny and true,This book is a great gift if you are the older sister giving it to the younger. It offers funny stories that you can surely relate to.
2,Not for adults,"My girlfriend likes Jesse McCartney, so we checked out this movie based on the reviews here. Definitely not something so funny for adults- none of the jokes really hit, and not too funny or interesting overall. It's mildly entertaining as a story goes, but it's about as funny as watching Dora the explorer.Probably do well for their intended audience, not a shrek joke quality movie for adults at all."
1,Pure GARBAGE,"Died after 2 years. Panasonic wont fix it, and now im stuck with it. Panasonic makes crap!"
5,Pure goodness,"This system is incredible. It has an amazing sound quality. Bass sounds great, but I'll get the subwoofers for an extra kick. A real bargain, too. Recommended."
2,Dissapointing,"This book is just not up to her usual standards. It is the first book from Gwynne Forster(I have read almost all of her books) with a heroine that I intensely dislike. Although I sympathize with what happened in her childhood, it wasn't enough to make me like Della or even feel sorry for her. She comes across as a self-serving know it all whose view of others is based on appearances and money although she occasionally shows more depth of character. I must say that if I was the hero in the book, I would not have hung around with Della as long as he did. I struggled through the book even though I did not like this heroine and could not understand the hero's willingness to take whatever she dishes out."
2,"Nice looking design, poor materials","Received this kettle as a gift 3 years ago, used it for almost 2 years and then realized the inside was actually rusting! I have several cook pots of Le Creuset so never imagined that I should watch the inside of the kettle for anything like this. Rusting isn't a great outcome for such a fine quality kettle or as a Le Creuset product. I hated to throw it out but have gone back to my basic stainless steel kettle instead.Had thought perhaps I just had a one-off problem, but my parents had the same issue twice! Sorry, this one is a no-go for future buyers...."
4,Excellent Teapot,"Well worth the money. In many decorative colors. Feels nice. Everything works the way it should. Pours without spilling. The only drawback I can see is that my girlfriend complains that the lid is too tight when cool. I have no problem, and I believe that were it more loose, it would rattle when hot due to the metal expanding. Large capacity is great (we have long commutes and take travel mugs to work)."
2,Disappointment,"Well, let me start by saying I am glad I did not pay retail price for this teakettle. I purchased mine on ebay for $45 plus shipping and I am still disappointed with product.Good: Looks nice and matches are other cookware and well hell its the famous Le Creuset!Bad: Spits hot water when pouring, handle gets so hot you always need a towel or mit to pour, seemsto take forever to heat up. OMG its the famous Le Creuset and it sucks.Pass on this one no matter how tempted."
2,"If you like rust in your tea, this one is great!","These kettles rust easily, it is unfortunately because they do look nice and match other Le Creuset cookware well. A bit funny reading the review battles over whether people are caring for them properly - how do you know who to believe? But my 2c after having two of these kettles is simply to stay away or just be ok with buying a new one every year."
3,No spill-free pour with this LeCreuset,Product shipped promptly and arrived in good condition. Teapot looks nice on the stove..... unfortunately I can't seem to get a spill-free pour from it after it has boiled. You have to be careful not to fill too much water before heating or it will build up pressure and spurt hot water while you pour...
2,Inside Rusted,My wife and I had one of these kettles for two years and it eventually rusted through. Apparently we weren't supposed to fill it fully or leave it filled with water? Both of those seem like really unusual requirements for something as simple as a tea kettle. I won't buy another.
1,Doesn't pour....,"I've recently bought a lovely le cruset kettle and I think ONCE I've managed to get it to pour without boiling water dribbling out all over my kitchen top. Maybe it's just my common background, that I've not been brought up to pour correctly but I really don't think I should have to spend time, effort and attention trying not to get spillage from a kettle.This product is design flawed, but my partner does say its creating a good 'mess clearing' habit. That's humour that frankly, I could do without."
3,Good but the cover does not fit,I like everything about this kettle except that the cover does not fit very well. It takes excessive force to get it in or out.
1,Kettle Rusted Quickly,Within a month the kettle rusted where the spout connects to the body. Should have bought a cheaper Stainless Steel.
4,Love everything except the whistle could be louder??,I love my kettle - it boils water quickly but the whistle isn't very loud - that's my only gripe!
1,Scalding danger from 1.1 Litre Le Creuset teapots,"IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING! I bought a 1.1 Le Creuset teapot several months ago because it seems like a heavy-duty teapot that would last awhile, plus it was a pleasing blue colour. However, boiling water has poured out of the spout many times. I do not overfill it, but even the slightest bit of extra water results in a very dangerous situation. The scalding water ejects out of the spout in an arc, covering our stove/countertop - whichever way the spout is turned. This has happened with the spout cover flipped up, or down (in the 'whistling' position). It has also happened with very little water in the teapot. Yesterday a guest in our house could have been seriously burned on her stomach, down her leg and on her foot as the boiling water arced out of the spout. . I can not let anyone use it, and my children are not allowed near it. I have taken it out of our house. THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THESE KETTLES AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED!"
1,Junk,"Throwing the replacement of my replacement away: how can Le Creuset sell a tea kettle that rusts when it touches water? The coating on the inside disintegrates and then rusts, the ring that hold the lid to the pot rusts, and the plastic whistle melts. Yes, I do empty it after using it. I won't be buying another Le Creuset product when the quality is gone and customer service is so poor. Good thing there are lots of alternative brands of cast iron available now."
1,So much to not like,"The whistle is blood curdling and angry sounding.And as an added bonus this way over priced pot drips hot water down the spout onto the counter, floor or your foot - what ever happens to be underneath.It's pretty, but that wears off real fast. both my wife and I hate it."
2,Obnoxious whistle.,"We received this as a gift and it will replace our old Revereware tea kettle. I do have an issue with the whistle, however. Our old kettle has a beautiful song, as the note will slowly rise in volume and pitch until it settles on it's final, unmistakable note at full boil. The whistle on the LeCrueset cannot seem to settle on a single note, it warbles and garbles random pitches and volumes in a very awkward way. Is this what the designers and engineers planned, or did they forget to actually try it? Maybe the sound of the whistle was never a consideration or they got a really good deal on the hardware. Either way, I've heard a lot of tea kettles in my life, and appreciated a good many of them, but this one sounds obnoxious."
4,Worth The Price!,I've only seen a couple of the movies but I've never see this stuff on cable TV so its worth getting. Reasonable price and the discs are labeled so its easy to find your selection. I'm looking forward to checking most of these movies out over time and that's a great compliment for a public domain movie set! 4 of 5 stars.
3,the western are movies are the movies I like,I bought the product for Lee Van Cleef I saw his picture on the cover and took for granted that he was in the majority of the films but i was mistaken he appeared in only one of the films the other 19 were other people I knew little about their ok
2,Pretty bad..............,"As others have mentioned. The video quality is dismal. Only a couple of movies rate above dismal. And, even they are about as good a a VHS tape transfer............................if that.The audio quality isn't much better.Only reason I gave this movie pack two stars is because of the low price and sheer quantity of movies."
4,Classic Westerns,Classic old school westerns from the 60's and 70's if thats what your into you will like them my personal favorite was death rides a horse great film only downside to this collection is the picture quality but there old films so what do you expect.
5,Spaghetti Western movie pack,Bought these for my dad to watch while on the road away from his satelite t.v. service. He said they were just as described and I received them in a timely fashion.
1,Very poor quality,"The Title was very misleading ,i was after Lee Van Cleef Movies but got only 2 of his movies .The quality of the movies were unwatchable ,Very ,very disappointing.I was that disappointed that i will not buy another DVD from Amazon. If it didn't cost that much to return the movies I would .Very Very disappointing . Amazon please lift your game .What a waste"
3,I Have No Idea,I can't say if this is good or bad because I never received it. (No fault of the seller) Apararently this is very hard to find.
1,"the most Famine glam band in the world, 80's wash ups","I seen one of these guys videos the other day on VH1, and totally forgot how bad they were, this is the worst of the 80's hair bands, even worse than Poison.side note: One apon a time a band toured with this band, they hated this bands name so much, they desided to name their bandUGLY KID JOE, and so when fans went to see them live, the sign on the stadium would read: tonight: Pretty boy floyd, and Ugly Kid Joe."
5,This band is worth checking out,I happened to stumble across My Secret Service in a New York City club several weeks ago. These guys have a very cool sound -- a lot of fun to watch live. The album is really quite strong too -- just very solid songs. I highly recommend either picking up the CD or checking them out live.
4,Looking forward to an updated version,"This is a good start to anyone serious about understanding Japan's economy. However, it needs some updating."
5,The best college Freshman Calculus textbook ever.,"As a professor of Physics and Engineering, I frequently get questions and complaints from students taking a traditional Calculus class using a traditional Calculus text about one point or another that escapes their understanding. Since Ash & Ash came out with The Calculus Tutoring Book, I simply have them look up the same topic in their text. Universally, they have been so impressed that they ask where they can buy a copy for themselves! Such a student response is the best endorsement any textbook can achieve. I regularly recommend the book to my Physics and Engineering students as a necessary addition to their personal library. I highly recommend the book to any serious student of the Calculus, particularly if Science or Engineering is their main interest."
2,YOU HAVE TO BE JOKING!,"'MS. ASH' MUST BE OUT OF HER MIND IN REGARD TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HER 'TEACHING' CAPABILITY AND THE 'COST' OF THIS BOOK. I DO EMPHASIZE 'COST'! BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT YOU COULD PURCHASE ANOTHER BOOK AMONGST MANY, THAT IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE AND AUTHORITIVE AS THIS ONE, AND WOULDN'T COST YOU HALF AS MUCH. ACTUALLY IT'S A BIT DISGRACEFUL THAT THIS WOMAN EXPECTS SO MUCH FROM THIS 'PAPERBACK WITH APPROXIMATELY 200 PAGES. I GUESS GOD CAME BACK IN THE FORM OF 'MS. ASH'."
4,Need a patch to work on Windows XP,It didn't work on my Windows XP laptop. I emailed the technical support and they told me to download a patch for XP fromhttp://www.m-2k.com/pages/Tech/main.asp?pagename=dk-020.mpcWorks well after installing the patch.
3,Not what I thought it was.,"I'd forgotten that this was a kind of comedy skit show, not a story series like the first one."
3,could have been better,"save your money and buy the cartoon series, not the club house. its ok, but the cartoons with out the real people in it are much better. wish I had known the difference"
2,Not what I expected,"What I failed to remember was that each year ""The Archies"" shows changed a lot. I was hoping to get some cartoons that maintained a story. Or even I enjoyed the year when Archie had Dick Tracy, Broom Hilda and other cartoons on. This particular season had neither. It was basically Laugh-In with the Archie characters. While these little skits that appear may of been funny at the time...today they appear as a bunch of dated short gags. I played the first episode for my daughter and even she lost interest before one episode was done. I wish I would picked the volume with Archie on the cover or even the Sabrina edition. Previous reviewers give the 5 stars and I write this review to give you a different view point. What you get here that may be a plus to some is you get more music from the Archies....myself I wanted the cartoons. This was a purchase I regret making even at less that $20."
5,The Archies' live revue a rockin' laugh riot!!!,"I was about seven years old when ARCHIE'S FUNHOUSE premiered on CBS in the fall of 1972. By those standards, the show was high-tech entertainment, combining animation with a live children's audience, very inventive and ahead of its time. All of the Archies gang--Archie, Betty, Reggie, Veronica, Jughead, Hot Dog, Moose, Dilton and Big Ethel--still belt out the hardy laughs as well as the songs that are reminiscent of childhood innocence gone by.What's big about this collection is the addition of the SUGAR, SUGAR video that was scene in the original Archie Show. That really makes my day whenever I wake up and want to put on an old cartoon instead of the same old morning newscast."
3,works fine-- so far. maybe i'm lucky,"I bought mine about a year ago (though not from Amazon), and I've had no problems at all. If I had read through these reviews, I probably would have steered clear of the unit.I got mine really cheaply at a mega-warehouse place near my house where I tend to shop more for a six-months' supply of diapers and toilet paper than consumer electronics.It's sort of boring really, just works without incident. I don't know if I like Panasonic per se, but because this combo unit worked out fine I also picked up a really cheap receiver to go along with it, and that also has been just fine.I guess I was lucky to get an ok one."
2,"VHS player good, DVD player less than good","Briefly I ordered this for reasons everybody does but have already returned it & am considering my options on a different purchase. In the past I always had tremendous good fortune with Panasonic products so I tried this one without hesitation. The VHS player seemed wonderful, but the the DVD player would freeze for no apparent reason on brand new DVD's on a scene & you'd have to turn it off & the best you could get from it was to start over again at beginning. Sometimes it would claim the just opened DVD was ""dirty"" if you could not even get it to re-start at the beginning as it often would. The unwanted freezing would occur anywhere from every 5 to 20 minutes & became infuriating quickly. Maybe I was unlucky but this experience was unpleasant to say the least."
2,DVD STARTS TO BREAK DOWN AFTER A YEAR,"I've had this DVD/VCR combo for over a year. I didn't use it that often, and now I wish I had. It would have broken down sooner, and I would still have the warranty. The VCR works fine, but the DVD won't play my discs anymore. It makes a clicking noise and a blue screen comes on saying ""this disc is dirty and has scratches, etc."" Bull. All of my discs are recent purchases, new and clean. I tried them on my friends' DVD players and my own computer and they work fine. It is the DVD player that's not working. Panasonic used to be a good company, but I think they're no longer reliable. BUYERS BEWARE."
3,Too many politics and not so many shotguns,"I miss more information about the core topic: the Spanish fine shotguns. There are only a few pages with shotgun's pictures, which is a great way to see the excellent quality of the Spanish shotguns. I miss more information related to the different models manufactured in Spain (luxury O/U do not appear at all and they have been sold to Royal Houses around the world...). There is also an extensive description (biased in my opinion) of the history of the basques which adds little interest to the main topic: the Spanish shotguns. The best of all is that the author has had the courage to show internationally the outstanding quality of our guns and to fight against the black legend about the Spanish steels."
3,Primarily a reference book.,"A book that is what it says it is. This is mostly a compilation of standards, in the format of a reference book. I was looking for specific implementation details for MPEG, and this was not the book for me. Still, I am keeping it as a reference and anyone looking for the same will not be disappointed."
5,Afordable Luxury,"These sheets feel so good against your skin that it's almost sinful. I have had mine for a few months and they have been put through numerous washings. They are still like new (only softer & more comfy). I believe that if you invest a little extra for these sheets up front they will pay off in the long run. They should wear much longer that the lower thread count sheets, and all the while you will feel like you are staying in a five-star hotel each night as you slip between them for a wonderful nights rest."
5,well received birthday gift!,"I got some of these for myself and my mom loved them so i bought her the white ones for her birthday. they are a little shiny, which you can't see in the pic. They fit great on her queen size bed. great buy=0)"
2,So disappointed!,"I had great expectations of this sheet set after reading the initial reviews. I am disappointed with the actual product. As other have stated, I was not aware these were ""sateen' sheets. Also, these are the roughest 600 count sheets I have ever felt! I washed them per instruction and they came out worse than my other sheets with half the thread count.They were a bargain, so I guess in the end you get what you pay for."
4,Very Luxurious!,"I have had these sheets for almost a month now and I am very happy with them. They were delivered in less than a week and are very soft and pure white. They are not shiny or slick like some sateen. The fitted sheet fits my extra deep mattress and the pillow cases are very generous. They come out of the dryer perfect. Overall, a very good sheet set, especially for the price."
2,Cotton SATEEN,"Product description missing the word SATEEN. If you hate sateen as much as I do, don't buy this product. If you love sateen, there's nothing else wrong with this product that would prevent you from buying it."
3,Good as new?,"Its a subjective opinion ""Good as New"" - I would not give this description to the book I received. It was in Good condition, but definitely NOT ""Good as New"" - The book looked well used but not abused - Oh well, its a great book and will be well used again and again and again."
5,The Seminal Contemporary Text on Italian Renaissance Art,This text is the standard by which all other modern commentaries on Italian Renaissance art should be judged. Treat yourself and get the hardback edition. Many thanks to David Wilkins for advancing the work begun by Frederick Hartt.
5,History of Italian Renaissance Art Review,"This book is beautiful and thorough, and even though I had to buy it for class, I am very glad that I did and will keep it when the semester is over. The price was right and I love the book."
5,Good cup of coffee,This is really easy to use and produces a cup of coffee as good as my home coffee maker. A good buy for coffee where electricity is not available.
4,Sweet Wild Wench,"Joe Puma has to solve some murders and juggle girlfriends at the same time. Puma is a hard-bitten PI who's not afraid to use his fists. Characters are fleshed out, but the novel is more plot driven. I didn't guess the ending. Recommended for hardboiled fans."
2,bad quality,Jeffery Frederich was a very talented man however this CD is one of the worst I've ever heard. The quality of these recordings is shamefull!
4,NBA ACTION,NBa action is the wrong title for this game there is little action at all. But because the game is slow paced it allows it to be way more realistic than other titles like nba jam. There is season mode as well as regular games so this will last you a long time.
5,best sandpaper around,love these flexible sanding pads; makes my work alot easier and seem to last a long time. Can't seem to find them in the stores anymore so I'm glad I found them here.
4,Fascinating,"This book is worth the price just to hear the constant process of American culture - be a pirate, fend off ""the man"" to build your industry, become ""the man,"" then go after the pirates who are presumably cutting into your business. Money makes hypocrites of us all. Please, RIAA, don't sue me for reading this book (although I'm sure you'll find a way, if there aren't any grandmothers or poor college students you can harass)."
1,Pay money for this book? Please. Don't insult me.,"I don't know how anyone can take Lessig seriously. He's leading the counter-culture movement with books like this, but if you buy that ideology then he's selling you out by publising with the big publishers.If you really want to read his arguments, download this book for free at http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/. He's finally starting to practice what he preaches.Think about copyright law for yourself. Read the copyright statute. Read cases. Don't take someone else's word for it. The exclusive rights system of copyright law predates the Revolutionary War. It exists because of technological changes (like Gutenburg's printing press), and (rest assured) it will surely survive the digital revolution. In other words, copyright isn't dead despite the current vogue in academia of saying it is.Bottom line: Don't be a dolt. Don't pay for this book."
2,Palm Tungsten T5 Handheld - extensively used & re-sold - product review,PDA looks in alright condition. Still it is not having the classy touch and elegance of a fresh gadget. Would have preferred to have the charger along with this.PS: This is a product review for the purchase of a used product and not the brand new Palm Tungsten T5 handheld.
3,Palm Tungstun TX,"This Palm is the same as the old one I was looking to replace, however, I find that there are some defects in this new device.Palm obviously just dumped their old unsold unit to outside retailers and since they do not offer any support on this device the purchaser is stuck with the problem. I was a loyal Palm custome, however, I will not buy any other Palm product at any time in the future."
2,DO NOT run true to size...,"The ad says above that these run true to size. What sizing method? I wanted to have this style as I liked the way it looks and seems to be very high quality and the promise of comfort, but I'll never know as I could not find a size to fit my average foot. They were way too narrow! If you have a narrow foot, they'll probably fit fine, but if you have a normal or wide foot.... FORGET IT! I was fotunate that I had the oppertunity to try these on from a ""brick-n-mortar"" store, so I could try on several styles and sizes. Mephisto seems to run narrow all the way across the board."
1,Leather Wrist Wallet,"A good concept, well executed but much too small. Hard to store money, too small for credit cards and ID."
2,startlingly stupid,"i bought this as an alternative to a wallet. I thought it would be clever. Nope. it doesnt fit cards at all, unless you have some gargantuan wrist (the cards fit longways, and even then you can have maybe two, AND EVEN THEN the cards wont bend so you have this awkward shape). I have average wrists and had to sew in extra velcro to make this thing fit. Even now - it only holds a little cash. I only use it on days i use my jimi wallet. fairly useless."
1,"Good in theory, but that's it","Yes, it fits my ID & Credit card in it. But I didn't realize it'd go in horizontally, so there's this big rectangular shape across my wrist if I wear it. So really its just good for cash and change. The velcro allows it to be a *little* adjustable at least."
2,doesn't fit canadian bills unfolded,"i thought i'd be able to fit plenty of unfolded canadian bills but pouch is too narrow and when you fold they money then it becomes hardly impossible to wrap it around your wrist. i'm a 5'7, 130 pounds female and wallet was too big to fit on my wrist and almost too small to fit on my ankle. i guess it's good for runner who wish to fit one key and a little money, but not suitable for me"
5,Madhatter's Guide to Chocolate,"Rhett DeVane's Madhatter is a wonderful book - I highly recommend it for pleasure and thought! It is touching and makes you think about situations ""other people"" find themselves in. Her wonderful sense of Southern humor (my favorite brand) is heartwarming. She has woven a beautiful story in with thought- provoking life - things that are real and happen everyday somewhere - whether we chose to acknowledge it or not. I am a reader - not a reviewer - I DO LOVE TO READ - about 40 books a year - Rhett's is DIVINE!Cheryl, Suwanee, GA"
5,A refreshingly warm and witty book.,"Rhett DeVane has written a gem with The Madhatter's Guide to Chocolate. Her descriptive phrases put the reader completely into the scene, experiencing the smells, tastes, and emotions on every page. The title may be a tad misleading; it is not a cookbook, although there ARE delicioius recipes scattered throughout. A thoroughly delightful read.Mary Thomas Acton"
3,LOST POTENTIAL,"I remember catching this film on Showtime or Cinemax, one boring weekday evening, and being captured by the cinematography, lighting, mood, etc.. Now as far as the central focus of the plot is concerned the reviewer from Salem, IN is 100% on point, but the film would definitely have been infinitely better if the ending was half as a smart as the rest of the picture."
4,One of the best.,One of the best Law drama's ever made and set the track for others. Michael Douglas can do no wrong in films. This is an early one and a great one.
2,"Mediocre, Disappointing","I thought this would be a good vigilante movie. It is not. Unlike other vigilante movies, it is not fun. Just preachy. Don't waste over $8 on this bore fest, with many improbable plot elements. If you like Michael Douglas, get ""Falling Down"" instead. It is cheaper and 10 times better."
4,"great film, great plot, great acting, needs better ending!","This is one of my favorite Michael Douglas films of alltime! Douglas gives a superb performance as a young,ambitious, and intense judge who strongly desires to doright for his fellow man. However a series of loopholesmanifested by witty attorneys force him to let savagecriminals go free without punishment. Enter fellow judgeand mentor Hal Holbrook who senses Douglas's frustrationand reveals to him a shattering secret. Holbrook's""father figure"" performance is very enjoyable andprobably makes him the most likeable character in themovie.The other actors are just as convincing. Yaphett Kotto,who never disappoints gives an excellent performance as acop trying hard to solve a series of child murders. JamesB. Sikking gives a extremely dramatic performance as thedistraught father of a murder victim. However, the endingcould have used some improvement. Never the less, this filmdelivers an entertaining display of flaws in the judicialsystem."
5,Great movie finally available on DVD!,Hard to believe it took so long for this one to be released on DVD!
2,"Good premise, but weak plot line","Good movie idea about superior court judges taking the law into their own hands when technicalities allow guilty criminals to be set free. But after setting this up, the story really doesn't have anywhere to go. Good performance by Michael Douglas."
5,"Exceptional album, worthy to acquire!","This album represented for Pierino Gamba (a notable Rossini director) a majuscule triumph, because he made a special chemistry with a notable and talented soloist like Ruggiero Ricci interpreting one of the most expressive and solvent ""Gypsy airs"" ever played. Ricci plays with the perfect balance between refined musicality and monstrous technique. With the Introduction and Rondo capriccioso, we have a similar outcome. Carmen Fantasy is vibrant and exciting; although Rosand makes a more gentle approach. The Havanaise is memorable too.Expressiveness without ostentation, sheer lyricism and vibrant emotion confers this album five stars all the way through. Two versions that definitively can not be absent of your treasured collection."
3,It's okay....,"The stap is wide so it helps disperse the weight of your guitar over your shoulder. I noticed the raised padding on the strap is on the outside of the strap, you'd think the raised padding would be on the inside preferably on your shoulder, I guess it's better than no padding at all. The strap looks good, it's still kinda stiff but after it breaks in (soaked with sweat, stretching during 3 hr gigs...e.g.) it should work out okay. The little pocket for the pick is kinda cool and functional. Over all it's okay."
5,I hardly know it's there,"Great strap, plenty strong enough for a bass guitar, lightweight and very comfortable.Very well made. The pick ""pocket"" is a nice touch. Highly recommend this strap."
4,Comfortable and lots of adjustments,"I play a stingray type bass and need a decent strap to help support the bass. I bought this strap because had features that I thought would work for me. The internal pad, however, slides within the strap and doesn't stay where it would be most effective. The amount of adjustment that you get out of this strap is great, except the strap tends to loosen due to the material that it is made out of (the buckles will move around when you aren't playing). It does support the weight of my bass nicely, though, and it is comfortable. I've played 3-4 hour shows and didn't feel sore from the weight of the bass afterwards."
2,Ouch!,"The strap has several issues. First the padding was so long that even with the strap shortened toits shortest possible, the bass would have to be played from around thehips and it only had one hole to attach; would prefer 2 holes in case one tears/wears.Second and more important, the nylon, where the strap ends is sharpand irritated my husband's neck to the point of cutting it. There was nothingto do to fix this, so we returned the strap."
2,It's way too quiet,"I have to admit that I like loud volume on music, though I can listen to music at normal human levels as well. This player, however, doesn't even go past whispering volume. It's alright If you listen to your music in a very quiet room but I tend to use it mostly on subways and outside. This moring I was walking down the street and couldn't hear it over the sound of the wind blowing. That is not good. I also have some very nice headphones that I got thinking it would solve this problem. It didn't. Right now I'm trying to find ways of getting it to go past 25. I'm thinking 50 at least.Equally frustrating is the pause between tracks when playing MP3s and the stupid dancing musical notes that serve abolutely no purpose that I can think of.My model number is SL-MP353J - Maybe the problem is fixed in later models as I can't think of why not too many other people seem to be bothered by the volume issues."
5,Great Unit! Great Price,"I'm new at CD burning and I wanted a good solid unit without spending a ton of money. After reading many reviews and reading the problems with units skipping or not reading MP3s, this unit has none of the problems. It doesn't skip even if dancing. You can burn MP3s without worring about if it will read your files. The headphones are about average but not horrible by any meansSure I would like to have equalizing capabilty besides bass boost as will as an AC aqdaptor, car adaptor, and rechargable batteries (available as extras). But then it would cost more than [money] or be of less quality. I gave it 5 stars because I don't believe you will find a more solid working unit for the money. It's nice hassel free enjoyment."
3,Good player but not great,"Good features, great price. The sound quality is good although not very loud. I had some skipping & static noise problems with MP3 CDs. When played on my DVD player the songs played fine. Also the skipping and static noise were not consistent. A ""problem"" song played again would play fine.Otherwise a fine player and a good value for money."
3,Needs some design change,"I am a big Melissa and Doug Fan. We have alot of the wooden food sets and I love the quality.The dry erase board is really cute compared to most dry erase boards. My daughter enjoyed decorating the sides of the board. The one issue is the board is too narrow on the sides to put the wooden decorations on without the hanging over onto the dry erase board. When the child tries to use the eraser it won't erase around the areas where the wooden decorations hand over. This can be frustrating for a 4-5 year old.The eraser is very poor quality. After about 6 uses it doesn;t works anymore so you have to use a paper towel.Overall the toy is cute, and I like it being wood over plastic but it needs some changes in design to make decoratig and writing/erasing possible."
1,Lousy materials - terrible waste,"I would not recommend this. It happened to be the least expensive white board sold via Prime, and so my fiancee and I thought it would be kind of a neat, yet strange, item for the kitchen (for notes, lists, etc.).If I gave this to a kid, I think I could guarantee you one disappointed tot. First, the sparkle glues don't even adhere to any of the wooden frame or add-ons. When they dry, they slip right off like cookies from a non-stick cookie sheet. Second, the marker dries out in a shockingly short amount of time, and was faint from the get-go.In general, a truly lousy product. Skip it, both for children and childish adults."
5,It reveals their character,"Has any Pakistani ever read this book ? They should, it reveals their character. It exposes when the people belongingb to one religion change to ferocious animsls when they change religion.The UN should take up a program to find out if or how religions change the character of men. This they should do in the interest of the mankind, who are no more safe for one reason or the other. I feel for the people who were so brutally murdered for their religion, I know if there is any god, he would some day take action on the people belonging to this harmful religion. h"
4,The Man Who Made It Snow,"Great, quick read. Jumps around a bit and wish there were more details in some parts, but overall a cool story. A great book to go with the movie, Cocaine Cowboys."
4,Radiator Springs McQueen - sleek but not all that,This McQueen is different than the regular McQueen - slightly darker maroon with a white swoosh on both sides - it is supposed to be the McQueen that appears after the Radiator Springs team fixes him up...my son was slightly disappointed though because the wheels were not white. I found out there was yet another McQueen with the whitewall tires. Go figure!
5,Very Satisfied,I am very happy with the product and the time period it was delivered in. Very happy with the seller and would do business with them again.
1,THIS IS NOT SMOKEY WILSON THE BLUES MAN,"This is an older white man doing cowboy type stuff, I don't know how he got mixed up with the other Smokey. It should not be listed with Smokey Wilson the blues man, I bought a copy of the other Smokey (the cowboy) because of this listing what a disappointment it sucks. So beware one star is to much in my opinion."
2,Light on animal facts...,I thought this would be a fun learning game for my boys. It came with cards that talked about mortgages & food/water for the animals without any explanation of how to use that information. We ende dup just skipping that part & buying animals & charging basic rent when others landed on the space. It would have been so much better with animal questions or facts plus directions.
4,Different look at book promotion,"This book is different in that it primarily focuses on promoting your book with audio and video, such as producing CD or DVD publicity video pod casts. One good piece of advice offered - follow the money and the markets used by self-published book authors that are successful in marketing their wares. Excellent appendices.Rene' Jackson RN BSN MSCo-author with Alberto Righi MDThe Death of MammographyCaveat Press 2006"
2,New formula doesn't work,"The new formula without pseudoephedrine does not help with sinus issues. I kept taking them wondering why nothing was working, until I found a older pack in my medicine cabniet and realized the issue."
5,Great Toy!,"I've given a lot of Betty Spaghetty products as gifts and everyone LOVES them! This set is no exception...I picked it up for the first time last week and gave it to my niece as a birthday present. She's already hooked on Betty Spaghetty and couldn't get over the wonderful accessories! This product even smells like baby powder! Needless to say, Betty Spaghetty and her baby sister have gone everywhere with my niece for the entire week...and Betty changes clothes for every trip! :)"
4,Betty Spaghetty,I bought Betty Spaghetty for a 7 year old neighbor's birthday simply because it appeared to have a lot of play value. I found out later that Betty Spaghetty was already a popular toy with those little girls attending the party and that most already had one or more of the dolls.Seems like a good concept.
5,"GREAT; funny, witty & inspiring book for both children & adults!","Avon the snail has never experienced an adventure and he believes adventure is the secret to happiness. After meeting a new friend, Edward the ant, the two set out on a journey to find what they've been missing in life. In the end, they find out they didn't have to travel very far to find the excitment they thought they were missing. Along the way they meet many interesting & wise creatures that teach them things, for example ""it's better to look for nothing and find something than to look for something & find nothing"". GREAT;funny,witty & inspiring book for both children & adults! One of my new favorites; will be a classic someday!"
2,Insipid,"We read a fair number of books together as a family, and this one fell short of expectations. Although it has its funny moments, like an anticipated slo-mo snail collision on a narrow branch, other parts are eye-rollingly earnest. Think of it as ""Amelia Bedelia"" meets ""All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten."" Toward the end, this family's 11-yr-old, 13-yr-old, mom, and dad were ready to let Avon and Edward go adventuring on their own, and not bring us along to eavesdrop on their cloying conversations. Only our starry-eyed 8-yr-old - who still reads Amelia Bedelia - was eager to hear more."
5,Hilarious play on words!,My daughter borrowed this from the school library and read it out loud to her siblings and me. We laughed out loud again and again. The jokes are so clever! We have been quoting the book and laughing in the weeks since. I look forward to reading it and its sequel out loud many more times.
3,20% solid math 80% meaningless mumbo-jumbo,"I bought this text when I was first interested in learning the math behind quantum mechanics. I was attracted to the exposition of the mathematical formalism of spin. That part of the book did not disappoint. But the remainder was almost unreadable: longwinded, pretentious pontifications on the ""meaning"" of quantum mechanics. The author could have saved many pages by substituting the following: ""I really don't know what the ""meaning"" of quantum mechanics is"". No shame there. As Richard Feynman once said: ""Nobody understands quantum mechanics."" And he should know."
2,Interpretation Of Quantum Mechanics,"This is basically a Philosophical/Logical Analysis of thefundamental assumptions of Quantum Mechanics. What it comesdown to in the end is that it decides, for example, theadoption of Hilbert Space to work in is (philosophically/logically)justifiable for the development of themathematical underpinning of Quantum Mechanics! So, whatelse is new?What other Infinite Dimensional Space, other than Hilbert'swould improve matters? For example, could QED have beendeveloped on a more promising basis using a different Space assumption than Hilbert's? This book does not provide an answer."
3,From a jazzer's perspective...,"I am a huge Jimmy Smith & Joey DeFrancesco fan, as well as a HUGE Soulive fan, and I heard the title track on Pandora radio, so I thought, ""What the hey, I like what I hear; maybe this is a good raw jazz album.I was left feeling a little dissappointed. As a jazzer, I was waiting for big solos in the middle, and they never came. Soloistically, this album is like listening to a 6th-grade big band. I can tell Ron Pedley is a good B3ist, but he never ""unleashes."" Likewise, Pondel's compositions on this album are quite solid, and they groove, but there is never that ""Oh Man!"" moment. Well rehearsed band, overall, but a little lacking from a jazzer perspective. This is a cd more geared for easy-listening fans.Pros: Well-rehearsed band; smooth and accurate; good compositionsCons: no climax; ""restrained"" soloing; no characteristic tracks, more easy-listening than jazz."
3,Okay for a book about money,"The book is well done, but needs to be updated with the current features of dollar bills. There are other books about money that I like better than this one. If you are looking for a quick, factual book about money, than this one is for you."
2,Do you really need this textbook?,"If you are an English conversation teacher new in the business (esp. Japan) and have little in your arsenal then you might find this book useful. Otherwise, don't bother with this overpriced text."
2,questionable,I guess if you don't have the time to prepare your lessons by yourself this book would be helpful. Otherwise its a big rework of other people's ideas.
2,tape missing,"I think this book would have been better if I received the tape. I have better ESL books than this. Other than the limited word work, the rest I could not use."
1,Good for new teachers only,"I was sorely disappointed by this book. It's an *overpriced* compilation of common games and activities well known those who have a couple of years of teaching experience. If you're new to the teaching field, it could be helpful. If you've been in the classroom for a while, don't waste your money."
1,Save your money!,"I can't believe I just spent [money] on this extremely overrated book! Let me sum up this book for you: BINGO, crossword puzzles and Hangman! Oh yeah! And an audiotape of questionable durability... Save your cash and look up ideas (for ESL games) on the internet instead."
5,FANTASTIC PRODUCT,"I WAS TELLING A FRIEND ABOUT MY 30 YR OLD LEATHER BRIEFCASE HOW WORN OUT IT WAS AFTER 30 YEARS OF BEING ON THE ROAD WORKING,HE SUGGESTED BEFORE I BOUGHT ANOTHER BRIEFCASE FOR $400.00 TO TRY NEATSFOOT OIL.FOUND THIS PRODUCT ON AMAZON AT A GREAT PRICE AND BOUGHT IT,AFTER ONLY ONE COAT OF THIS OIL ON MY BRIEFCASE,IT LOOKS ALMOST BRAND NEW AND THE LEATHER IS BEAUTIFULLY RESTORED.IF IT WORKS ON MY BRIEFCASE IT WILL WORK ON ANY LEATHER PRODUCT.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. ALSO IT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY.MY OLD SHOES ARE NEXT."
3,Half a book is better than none,"The original publication by David Beers Quinn is regarded as one of the more scholarly works on the subject. It therefore is a pity that the present offering comprises only Volume 2. The page numbering starts on 497 and runs to 1004 and a great deal is clearly missing. The promised map ""Raleigh's Virginia 1584-90 In pocket at end"" is missing and there is no 'pocket at end'. I await the production of Volume 1 with great interest."
3,Good but,Ok this collection of two songs is tight but really it should say in the title that it is a single. I probably wouldn't have bought it if i'd known it was a single. Ok there both great songs and all but for $7 i could have gotten an entire album. If you have $7 to spend either wait for an album by these two or go out and buy yourself some older stuff.
2,me no licke thees book,"this book looked like a book he just slapped together quickly. it was a lot worse than say, horror land. I was very disappointed. It wasn't funny or scary. It would be a very bad investment of money.by: Christian, age 11"
2,"A good idea, but not a very good story",A kid dies trying to jump Raven's Ravine. Then some ghosts inform him that he must save three scared people if he wants to ever be alive again. I think the book was too slow.
1,did not get item or tracking number but you took my money,where is my order if you send my order and i get it before the 8th of august i may change my mind but as of now i will never order from you again and my 300 freinds since i am a truck driver of all 48 and canada not to buy from you
1,"Make your phone not close properly, bad design!","If you look at all the images of them on the N90 they're all open phones instead of close. When you put the skin on the N90 will NOT close completely! I don't understand why someone wouldn't test this and make sure it's fine, now I am left with useless silicone skin and the one that goes on top of the lense is loose."
4,CoverKing Trans Am car cover,"Even though I have a Formula Firebird, I need the Trans Am cover because of the car's rear spoiler design. The cover appears well made, with sturdy-looking stitching on the seams and edges, and fabric pockets behind the cable grommet holes to avoid scratching the car's paint if a cable lock is used. Water doesn't penetrate the material, so the cover should be stretched as tight as possible to avoid water pooling and freezing."
5,Car Cover,It was easy fit and looks great. This cover has held up well in inclement weather of a Michigan winter.
3,"Material looks durable, but it doesn't fit properly.","Bought this for my 1999 Pontiac Trans Am.The cover is very light weight, which is good. It looks like it will reflect sunlight properly, as well as keeping bird poop and other stuff off the car. Also it seems durable and well constructed.The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because it cannot fit properly on the car. When I tug on one side to fit it over the car, the other side comes up, exposing that side to the elements. it's just a bit too small, it seems.I'll still use it though."
3,Good romp yet not enough Flinx & Pip.,"Bloodhype reads well, has layers of plots and interesting characters. Unfortunately, Flinx and Pip aren't two of them; they are barely in the story. Parts of the story are a little dated; however, it is easy enough to substitute the correct ""current"" technology and read on.If you like the Flinx & Pip stories, try The Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold."
1,MP3 buggy,"I just bought one of these. It could just be the one I bought, but... it works fine except for the following egregious problem: When it reads an MP3 file (and I tried several times on different CDs), it gets ""confused"" and treats each file as several different little tracks, making a delay between each one. At first I thought it was skipping, or buffer overrun, but nope, it's that weird thing. I will have to return it."
3,Good product with some annoying problems,"I bought this last spring and it's starting to die on me. It was a good CD player, with a few annoying features:1. The radio is difficult to tune, and I found that sometimes when I changed batteries, I would lose my settings. It was irritating having to redo the settings all the time.2. After about 4 months, it started to skip when held vertically. This is annoying if you are walking around with it.3. The recall feature is kind of pointless, as it brings you back to the beginning of the track, not to where you left off in the track.4. It's kind of ugly, and the controls are awkwardly designed."
3,Not that great of a CD player,"I bought this CD player a little over 2 weeks ago. If you're looking for something durable, this is not the one. I dropped it on a rug of all things and the lid broke. Now I have to open it manually. Also, it now doesn't play some of my CDs. It only plays a couple tracks and it skips horribly. So of you're looking for durability, buy a shockwave. The sound quality is pretty good, although the headphones aren't the greatest. They don't press snugly against your ear which doesn't allow you to hear alot of the bass. I basically use the thing to listen to the radio."
4,My Best Friend!,"This CD Player has been everywhere with me, has fallen millions of times, has been hit, and is still playing! Although it seems to skip sometimes, it plays. I also like that it has a built in radio for when your CD get too boring for you. It doesn't go very loud though. I wish it could go 10 notches higher. It also has the convenient HOLD feature which allows you to place your CD player in your pocket or backpack without it turning on and wasting your battery. It is overall a great choice!"
4,Great,"i got this cd player @ best buy the other day. it works great. the sound is excellent and the headphones work great. I found this at best buy and only paid [price]. this paid for the cd player and a special offer given only by best buy. for two years if your cd player stops playing, won't work, something breaks, etc., then best buy will either fix it or replace it. this was only [price]. i would reccommened looking in other stores before buying this on the internet. also, the headphones were a little to big for my head, so i tried using headphones off my old cd player. this didn't work. you can tell the difference in the sound, and i would reccommened just keeping the headphones that came with it.p.s. the radio reception is okay. you have to keep the headphone wires un-coiled because the headphones and wires act as an antenna"
3,Needs Update,"I like this author's credentials and perhaps what she has written about See's was once true of this company, but candy lovers should be aware that See's Candies labels say that the candies contain corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup, even though their website and catalog do not list ingredients. They seem to trade a great deal on their ""old fashioned"" image but neither their candy (at least in 2009) nor their customer service are ""old fashioned"", in the good sense, at all. When I returned candy to them because of the ingredients, unknown until receiving the packages, in spite of their satisfaction guaranteed guarantee, they have not issued a refund and have ignored my letters and e-mails. This book needs to be updated with a fuller description of a company that does not currently correspond to that ""sweet, charming, old fashioned"" image that they and this author seem to be cultivating."
2,Nice Device Poor Software,"The title says it all the recorder works well, but as a earlier review said it only has a 16mb SD card. The real problem is that for me, and perhaps I am alone, the software didn't work so I couldn't get my files downloaded to my comp. I am not sure if this is b/c XP is not supported or what. Also the manual refers to online help which either doesn't exist or is too hard to find."
3,Wedding Album,"I ordered this album because it had my parents' wedding song on it (""Let Me Call You Sweetheart""). Not my favorite version but it worked out okay. It would have been nice to be able to preview the music before purchasing."
1,Is this worth it? No!,"If you're looking for usable information on motivating employees, this is not the place to look. The article is only a page and a half, including the title, quote box and advertisement for the author's other books. It offers no new information that someone with a little common sense doesn't already know. I will think twice before ordering another e-book without a review."
3,has it's moments,"well let me start off by saying i didn't realise when i ordered this that all the remixes were done by dj tiesto. it's not made clear from this web page WHO actually does the remixes, or if it is, i didn't see it. for some reason i thought the remixes were by paul oakenfold. that said i really do like dj tiesto's dj mixes, and from what i've heard of his remixes they are mostly good. well that's what this cd is like, mostly good. my favourite track is #2, but most of the tracks were fairly good, but apart from track 2 (and a few others, forgot the numbers) i'm unlikely to listen to this cd more than a couple of times. if you really like dj tiesto, his remixes or haven't heard most of the tracks on this cd (i found that i already have half of these tracks on other cd's) you might wanna check it out."
2,Without Earth and The Moon,I bought this CD since I had a chance to borrow the LP album back in the 60's
4,The Moon - 'Without Earth / The Moon' 2 - lp's - on 1 CD (Rev-Ola),"If you're unfamiliar with David Marks,he was the guitarist on the first four Beach Boy's lp's. He played on such hits as ""Surfer Girl"", ""Little Deuce Coupe"", ""Surfin' U.S.A."" and ""409"". Mark's later band was The Moon that played light weight psychedelic pop. This CD issues the group's only two records, 'Without Earth' ('68) and 'The Moon' ('69). The rest of The Moon's line-up were: Mathew Moore - vocals, David Jackson - bass and Larry Brown - drums. Noticed that Moore had penned most of the material here. Tunes that I liked best were ""I Should Be Dreaming"", ""Someday Girl"", the catchy ""Give Me More"", ""Mary Jane"", ""The Good Side"" and ""Life Is A Season"". There are some bonus cuts tagged on, several 45's that appear to be mono edits, of ""Pirate"", ""Not To Know"" and three others. Marks had reportedly rejoined the Beach Boys in 1997 but had to leave again due to health problems. A nice find."
1,This book was the dumbest thing I've ever read in my life!,"I could describe this book in many words, but they would all be adjectives of stupid and meaningless, so I won't even try. This book made a mockery of the Old West and it made a mockery of romance. Even the love scenes are boring. Once you've read one, you've read them all. Variation is the key, Ms. Authoress! Spare us haywire plots about time-travel"
2,Summary: The Nasty Press Forced Clinton to Commit Perjury,"If you want objectivity, buy some other book. If you love the ex-president and still think he is a hero you will love this long-winded apology for his most notable acts in office. In 1963 Mr. Kalb should have reported about his abuse at the hands of the Secret Service as well as the reason they took such measures - to cover up JFK's affair. Apparently Kalb's silence bought him continued access to JFK's White House - a compromising journalistic tactic which he laments in this book."
2,Another attempt to rationalize Clinton's scandals,"This is another attempt, like many others, to rationalize Clinton's scandals. Clinton fan? Buy the book. Otherwise ignore it."
4,"sounds great, portable, looks good","These were a gift and an unexpected pleasure. The speakers sound great, they make the C240 look at home. The case is of decent quality, in the likes of altec-lansing or other near-premium brand. Battery operation is decent.Be careful to follow the directions, there is a combination of battery/power/usb cable that will supposedly damage the unit.It has a subwoofer output. This is the only upgrade I would recommend, it sounds good without it but if you look to displace a larger stereo get the subwoofer."
3,Too expensive for what it does,"It works but the plug in thing could not get past my Sansa protective cover. Had to shave off material from the rubbery cover with a utility knife. Then it would make contact with the cover on the MP3. Oh, heck--I sold this with my Sansa on eBay."
3,good sound,This item was exactly as decribed. A great big sound for a little speaker. I was very pleased.
4,A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE!,"I owned this game back on the NES. It was fun, but however it was short-lived. I never was able to finish the game (I think) becuase my system broke down. A few years later, I noticed that this game came out but i ignored it. Just last summer, i decided to buy a used version of this game. It reminded me of the old days back on the NES. The graphics were great for an old game, and the music was very unique. It was funny and hilarious even though it's an easy game. It also has a great re-play value. I hope to get the other Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle games soon."
3,Save Honey!,"Who: You(or in the game Bugs) What: Must save Honey from the evil daffy duck When: NOW!(or when you buy the game) Where: On your gameboy(isn't that convienent?) Why: So bugs and honey can be together forever *sigh* This was a pretty fun game. Bugs looks so cute. Warning: it's very addicting. Once you get through however, it's one of those games that isn't fun to play twice."
4,Great Portability!,These speakers deliver decent sound for the price. The included carrying case is a nice bonus!
3,A Pythonesque account,"I first read this book while I was at school, years ago. It's a reprint of various news/journal articles on inventions of the Victorian era. Lots of illustrations of improbable and otherwise inventions are presented - including the engravings of the NY pneumatic subway which decorates the walls of the average Subway sandwich outlet. The only complaint I have is that it's a bit light-on in terms of length. Still, it's worth a look. I bought it after having remembered it from years, so check it out."
1,"Sting, where are you?","This is not the same man that gave us Synchronicity or The Dream Of Blue Turtles. Sting seems tired and this record shows it. Songs like Desert Rose or Brand New Day are trully boring and would sound better as background for yuppies meetings. Gordon Sumner, a.k.a. Sting, lost his feeling and passion as composer somewhen between The Soul Cages and Ten Summoner's Tales. This cd's just keep going to nowhere with the burocratic ""Sting sound"" of today. Sad, but true."
4,A guilty pleasure but still great jazz rock - 4.5 stars,"Sting's ""Brand New Day"" is a very guilty pleasure (you're friends will probably make fun of you for listening to it). This, however, does nothing to deter how great most of the songs are. There's a pretty cool song halfway through the album (""Perfect Love...Gone Wrong"") where a French rapper cuts Sting off to rap about something we don't understand (unless you know French, of course). A lot of musical genres are explored in this album too, but most of it is rock with a jazz twist (and sometimes blues and country music). The entire album is very entertaining - it's definitely something you could play straight through and love (I WILL say, though, that ""Desert Rose"" is kind of a silly and annoying song. ""Fill Her Up"" is also a little cheesy). I couldn't call this album a classic, but Sting fans will absolutely love it. Highly recommended for fans of jazz rock, fans of Sting, and the curious!Highlights include:the entire album!"
2,Sorta good.,"Honestly, the only songs I like (and are of my all time favorites) are ''Desert Rose'' and ''A Thousand Miles''. I hate the rest of it, but the firts two songs are masterpieces."
2,Sting has definitely lost some sting.,"Well is it the age? I'm not sure, but I would guess it's the CORPORATE STING really emerging here. The songs, although well crafted, all end up like wet noodle soft rock. Let me say I really do like Sting, I love all the Police stuff, and ""Turtles"" is a most excellent solo disc. Now it looks like Sting-a-ding-ding is turning into the pop Kenny G he has been headed for with lame discs like Mercury and now this one. The songs here lack passion and most of the time are delivered very half-heartedly. While huge fans will find some treasure in this chest, I'll search for some other field of gold. (gulp, sorry)"
3,a disappointment,"I love Sting, I think he's one of the best pop singer/songwriter's ever. This CD is better than the best effort of most others out there. Having said that, I expected more out of this album. Having been blown away by Mercury Falling, Ten Summoner's Tales, Soul Cages and Nothing Like the Sun, I was disappointed by this CD. I agree with another reviewer that the best song is probably ""Ghost Story,"" which, along with ""Desert Rose"" shows that Sting still has the magic. His one of a kind voice, combined with inventive melodies and progressive harmonies, makes this album a must-have for die-hard Sting fans. However, for the rest of you, skip this album. The title song is slightly catchy, but a little odd, and is not particularly memorable as Sting songs go. You'll probably be disappointed with everything but ""Desert Rose,"" and maybe ""Brand New Day"" or ""ghost Story."" But if you're comparing it to most of the other pop/rock artists' efforts, then it still rises above."
1,Sting's worst album,"Mercury falling was dissapointing, but still contained musical talent, creativity and overall good taste. It was an album with a thread running through it, and it still holds it's place in my collection. My copy of Brand New Day however was sold long ago. IT has one of Sting's best songs on it, Thousand Years, it has one interesting though overcommercial song (with a terrible video), Desert Rose, and the rest could be said to be annoying and at times unpleasant. Big lie, Fill her up, Tomorrow we'll see, After the rain, songs you wished never exist. Sacred LOve sounds like a giant leap ahead in quality, let's hope it is..."
1,Hope the 8/5/03 new release is much better than this,This was probably his worst effort to date. It was painful to listen to. More painful the 2nd & third time. His incredible talent was completely wasted on this CD. Mostly noise & new wave drivel. Why? Stick with his last 3 CD releases before this. I couldn't get rid of this CD fast enough.
2,Career OVER!,"Hard as it is to believe, Sting was, in fact, cool once. Though even aging dinosaurs like me hardly remember it. This bizarre electronica/world beat embarrassment makes FIELDS OF GOLD seem like genius. Ba Bye."
2,Ya gotta pay for that castle somehow!,"Let's get this out of the way... Sting has always rated #1 on my playlist. Unfortunately, his time up to ""bat"" in my CD rotation is getting fewer and farther between. ""Brand New Day"" sounds ""similar"" to previous Sting, but there is something about it that does not hit the mark. I sincerely think that Sting is HAPPY. Happiness kills good music quicker than a bullet to the head! Depressed Sting was passionate, moving and lyrically poetic. He stills wears the trappings of his former self (all black clothes, etc.) but I think that he needs to quit having tantric orgasms just long enough to sadden up and produce some real music like only Sting can. Forgive my sheer disappointment, but Sting's latest attempt should have be entitled (a modified track 5) ""Perfect Musician...Gone Wrong.""Where for art thou Sting...?"
5,a bit of Sting's greatness,"in this cd Sting shows us that he can do whatever he wants to, because he is what we already know.Is very new album is what we call a anthem, a himn of contemporary sound, yet modern, made by his own hands, but with God's touch!!!"
5,Beautiful!,"Great variety of different styles here, but all beautifully choreographed (and all with Sting's marvelous voice of course). The Desert Rose song is especially lovely... if you like the variety of stuff that Sting is capable of doing, you'll LOVE this CD, easily one of my favorites of his."
5,Fusion of old and new sounds... excellent,The first two songs on the c.d. are the best songs I have heard in a long time. I believe this c.d. is just as good as his Ten Summoners Tales c.d. Each song tells a different story and actually has a purpose. One of the few artists who still knows how to write a song with meaning. If you are a Sting fan I would definitely say that this c.d. is a must.
3,"Not ambitious, but still very good.","Has Sting mellowed? I don't think so. He remains a master songwriter and and accomplished producer. The material is strong but his last several albums have a very similar groove. I think its partly due to some predictable guitar work by Dominic Miller. Miller's sound is quite plain and very session-ny. Sting's bass work is still great, and I think he has always been under appreciated as a bassist. Do we really need more predictable soprano sax work from Branford- even though I really love ya!? Bottom line, the songs are good (love the World Beat N. African Sound!) but the musical performances could use some more balls."
4,It's worth the Sting!,"I can buy Sting's albums with one thought in mind.His musical versatility & creative genius almost guarantees a great effort...Expect the same from ""Brand New Day"",a really smooth 10 Song collection sure not to disappoint the fan,Starting with 2 fantastic songs,""A Thousand Years"" & ""Desert Rose"",this CD has very few low points...I didn't care much for ""Big Lie,Small World"" or the Country sound of ""Fill Her Up"" but a very moving song about the risks of prostitution on ""Prelude To The End Of The World' and the very catchy tune ""Brand New Day"".Sting continues his musical legacy with this fine album showing the fan that not only fine wine gets better with age,but so does Sting.Run,Don't Walk to buy this awesome CD,as for me,I'm ready for another enjoyable listen.Where's that Play button?"
4,Amazing cd!,"Just want to spread the word out that Cheb Mami is absolutely one of the best Arabic singers out there and he adds an amazing vibe to Sting's track, ""Desert Rose"""
5,"I'll listen for a Thousand Years, and more!","This is quintessential Sting! I've likened this album to Madonna's highly praised ""Ray of Light."" Not since ""Soul Cages"" has Sting marketed such a fantastic album -- it is personal and infectious, lusty and clever. It's ""Song Cages"" gone electronica without the shipyard references. (Yet he's grown and changed, it's far from ""Song Cages II - the Return of Sting."")High praises go out for the two singles so far, ""Brand New Day"" and ""Desert Rose,"" but also for ""Ghost Song"" and ""After the Rain Has Fallen."" Ghost Song is the closest thing to a perfect love song. His music and lyrics meld superbly to capture the emotion of a lost love. I just can't wait for the day that ""After the Rain Has Fallen"" is released as a single. It just screams ""I'm a great Sting song!"" Great melodies, fun words and it's catchy!"
4,Classic Sting with a New Twist,"This CD still has many of the great reasons I listen to Sting in the first place, great lyrics, great smooth soulful sounds, and fabulous combinations thereof. But it also has several new twists there are several tracks that definitely have more of an electronic sound than previous Sting albums and overall I think it makes for some nice new music. I still think that the best quality is the lyrics and again Sting does nothing to dissapoint."
4,"The ""Educated"" Musician","I had a friend who once said, ""Sting is the educated genius of the pop world - he can read."" That's true and it's not. Sting is the only artist that I will buy a disc of without needing to listen to even a single track. However, wonderful this disc is, I've marking it down a notch because of his habit of needing to indulge the odd country tune on each of his last albums. Not only do I not really care for country; these attempts just aren't very good."
4,Very well produced....DESERT ROSE.....his best song in years,"Sting has moved into somewhat of a new direction with the incorporation of his first new co-producer in 8 years. This album contains layers and sequences of synthesizers giving his music a more up to date feel. Sting covers country, Alegerian rai, bossa nova, and just plain good songwriting. This album gels together much better than his last...Mercury Falling."
2,"Sting should be looking for a ""Brand New Sound""!","This CD is just a bore. The only stand out song is his latest single which he finally released called ""Desert Rose"" which is finally helping the weak sales of this CD.A definite miss, buy the single. I give Sting two stars instead of 1 because he is Sting.GRADE: D"
3,3 and a Half Star Piece of Heaven,"Sting was the guy everyone in class regarded as the 75 year old (OK, so he's only about 50) who was recently knighted and had his song in the Superbowl Half-Time. But soon he came to me as the Desert Rose singer, and I knew I HAD to have that CD. A while ago, we got it via Amazon.com, and I fell in love with it- not to mention that mysterious Arabic singer, Cheb Mami. Other notable songs include #4-After the Rain Has Fallen, and #5, Perfect Love... Gone Wrong. And the lyrics are actually GOOD- which is a heck of a lot more that we can say about some of our other CDs. So, I don't like all of the songs on the CD, but hey, every CD is like that. If you don't enjoy this CD, well... you will! Not loving it isn't an option."
2,Rap?,I was enjoying this album until it got to the 5th track. I never thought I'd hear rap on a Sting album. Had I known beforehand I wouldn't have bought it. I'm very disappointed...total waste of money.
3,Sting gets mellow,"A mellower Sting and very enjoyable. Good mood music for a nice dinner (and beyond) for two. Listened to it twice a day for about a week, and enjoyed it but couldn't help but think back to Sting's glory days with the Police, the music I grew up with. I do think it is one of Sting's better solo albums. Three and a half stars."
2,don't bother...,"The best song on the CD is the title track. If your looking for upbeat tunes, look somewhere else. The remaining tracks are slow and boring"
1,His weakest,"it is great that he found himself back on ""sacred love"".here he is unsure what to play...Pop?dance?jazz??soul?rock?you can surely pass this album by...even the best song from here (""after the rain has fallen"") is not that good to buy whole album.go and get SACRED LOVE!"
1,boring,"boring, boring, boring....the only song touching me was 'desert rose', and this because of cheb mami...the rest is a sleeping pill. i got all the sting-albums, but this is not a nessessarely one. even there are a lot of great musicians playing with him, this is not a garant for good music. sorry...just one star for that work."
3,More Work!,There is only two songs that are worthwhile to listen to! Both of the songs are short and at the end of the C.D.! If you ask me don't buy it!
1,Is Sting worse than Billy Joel ?,"10 years ago I would have said "" no it is impossible for anyone who has not actually committed a serious crime to be worse than Billy Joel"". Today I know better. Sting has almost single handedly destroyed the ears and the soul of an entire generation of yuppies.On the other hand Clapton probably stinks louder than even Sting."
4,Had to be fun recording,"At first, I wasn't sure where he was going, but, what Sting was able to cover in one disc was awesome. Forms from 40's 50's to today, all with challenging words, rock to country and with a smile in his voice.....most excellent - more more more"
2,"Brand new Day?...No man, this is Dark Night!","I am very disappointed with this. I bought this depending on the title song ""Brand New Day"". Appart of this song the rest is junk, but well arranged junk. This is the only reason I rate this with 2 stars and not 1, but good arrangements are not enough to give quality. This album is overrated and overpromoted. This has killed my last hopes for a return to the sounds of Police. Hey Sting, did you lose your way? So people don't buy this!"
2,yawn,"Unfortunately, Sting makes me sleepy on this album. I cannot decide if this is an album you have to replay and replay to find the real Sting or if this is Sting cutting loose an album for the sake of putting one out just for giggles. Two tracks are very hip and cool (Desert Rose and After the Rain has fallen) the others, well...yawn."
5,A little short on tunes..,"48 minutes is a little short for a CD these days. However, in the case of this CD it is the quality and not the quantity that counts. People need to stop comparing this CD to their other Sting ""favorites."" It's like comparing one of your children to the others. It's simply not fair. Sting has truly evolved from the time I saw him in concert in Houston, Texas in 1982. We as fans must evolve as well. Look how much the Beatles evolved over time. Sting is doing just that. You simply cannot last in the music industry by being stagnant. A reincarnation of Regatta de Blanc wouldn't cut it today. Sting is moving on, let's join him for the ride. Who else in pop music today can capture the essence of country and gospel in the same song? (Fill her up) Buy the CD, play it and enjoy it. Stop complaining that it doesn't sound like your favorite Sting CD."
4,Soulful Sting,"A must for the Sting Fan...though casual passers-by may be disillusioned by some of the material. ""Fill Her Up"" is unworthy of Sting. ""Desert Rose"" and ""Ghost Story"" are hypnotically beautiful. For the Sting Fan who has followed his work from the ""Police"" days to the present, there is the continuing theme of the Artist's struggle to understand the nature of human love, (Ghost Story), and what almost seems to be the fear of it. Painfully honest and confessional and a stark contrast from so much of popular music. Just skip by ""Fill Her Up""..."
4,Not his greatest work,"Sting is a great musician- on this album, songs like Desert Rose, and Brand New Day (the title track) portray his great ability. However, some of the other songs are a little questionable...(i.e Fill Her Up?) Overall, I have better albums on my shelf to listen to...but I would recommend this cd anyway"
4,Aging like fine wine,"Well I don't actually like wine, but I know the expression anyway. Sting has always been a favorite, Police fans pick up message in a box (great box set. Sting always seems to reinvent himself. He always has a very distinct voice, musically stylisticly speaking. (are those even real words? well I think you can figure out what I am saying)Great selection of songs here. I have to say though that after the wait for this album I was a bit disappointed. Each of his albums has continuly gotten better and better. But after his last album, which I thought was his best to date, my expectations were likely unrealistic. The album is a must for Sting fans. For others, I would say that it is likely something you could like, maybe not love though."
1,sting stinks,i bought this cd from you for my husband!s birthday. the only song on the cd that!s any good is brand new day which comes at the end of the cd & is too short.
3,nice try,"I think myself as a critical sting fan. he makes brilliant music, but not everything he composes and perform makes me warm from the inside. I bought this CD the day it was released and played it 10 times over and over again. Everytime hoping the music would catch me a, but it didn't.... like it didn't with 'The soul cages'. Too bad, but we just wait another 2 years and he probably comes back with a great piece."
3,Streamlined stinging,"At this point Sting was maintaining enough of a musical diversity to hold mild interest but had fused so many elements into more accessible and yes, dumbed-down compositional approach that it's no surprise it was what finally made him popular again."
3,Better than what I was anticipating.,"However, rather bland sounding at best. I found ""A Thousand Years"" a rather good piece, ""Desert Rose"" was decent, but not all that great, the rest was all forgettable, and showed that this was just an excuse to put out an album to fufill a record contract. The album comes to a horrible end with the title track which paralyzed me in depression. I'm not sure wheter the single version, or the album version is worse, but to me I know that anyway you slice it it's just enough to make me cry. I know that pretty much Sting made the comment in 1988 that he didn't give a F**K about rock and roll, but in 1991 he comes back with a more pop sounding album, and it continues in 1993, and in 1996 he comes out with ""Mercury Uprising"", and it has a rock sound to it, but here he decides he's caught in a lie, and now decides to cover it up with numerous musical influences, and it doesn't wash."
4,Very nice mix,"A very nice album from the one and only Sting, a la Mercury Rising. However, much more updated than its predecessor, Sting complements his matured voice very nicely with lush string arrangements, electronics samples and expert instrumentals. Very good, and definetely worth a listen."
3,Asleep at the wheel,"Now that Sting put the rest of us to sleep with his last couple of albums, he's gone ahead and recorded this in a daycare centre during nap time. Don't put this on your deck if you're driving home at two in the morning; you're likely to wind up in a ditch. Three stars for Ghost Story, though. A phenomenally touching lullaby.All in all, a fairly bland recording. It seems to me that Sting is in free-fall, which is awfully sad."
1,Unworthy.,"There are many overrated songwriters out there, and Sting (-what kind of name is that, by the way ?) is truly one of them. (Other examples are Elton John, George Michael, Prince, and Michael Jackson.) He was mediocre in ""The Police"", but completely without any kind of talent left today. -He couldn't write a decent tune if his life depended on it, even recently admitting he's all out of ideas. (-Many of us have known that well-kept secret for years !.) If you want true genius and brilliant songwriting, try the criminally ignored Todd Rundgren (""Utopia""), the criminally underrated Kerry Livgren (""Kansas""), or the criminally overlooked Ian Anderson (""Jethro Tull""), and Sting will forever vanish from your mind like he never even existed. Trust me."
4,Truly excellent,Tracks 1 through 3 are truly excellent. Loses something in the middle. Sting dredging to fill a CD? But finishes with a tremendous flourish Well worth the buy
1,No inspiration,"I allways loved Sting's music since he left The Police. His ability to put together the best musicians in the world, his beautiful melodies and odd time signatures (always ""making it swing"") were unique. It WAS more than just POP music. This album is unfortunately the worst thing he has ever done. It's just a comercial product. We (fans all over the world) will be waiting for a more meaningfull record."
1,Disillusioned,"I don't get it. All the styles are incoherent. Country Music like, and suddenly something else. Gosh, I am not sure what I have bought.Where are you, Sting? Where's all those good music you made during the past? Hello?I want to sell this CD back!!! And this is the first CD that I have ever gave 1 star! At least, Sting did succeed in doing something from me, I guess. Go buy something else. You will not regret it."
1,Hasn't quite got the sting!,"I saw Sting perform ""Desert Rose"" live in Manhattan and was haunted by the tune. On buying the album I was however, disappointed. The only two songs worth listening to are ""A Thousand Years"" and ""Desert Rose"". I always believed that Sting was one of the few musican whose album I could go out and buy knowing that I would like, if not love, all his songs. I am not so sure anymore and in the days of 14+ songs per CD, Stings 10 songs fall short of normal expectations."
2,Highly Disappointing,"This is turning into one of Sting's biggest (and longest enduring) commercial successes and its hard to imagine a less worthy candidate among his output spanning more than twenty years. While some have claimed it improves with repeated listening, I've reached the end of my rope in giving it a chance to take hold.The diverse musical influences and contrived eclecticism that are Sting's latter-day trademark now leave me longing for the golden thread that wound through his earlier career (think ""Synchronicity"" + 6 years) and entrenched him as the thinking man's megastar.While it's still comforting to hear him in new material, I can't help detecting signs of rot. A new Sting record should be an occasion for celebration, not a kicking-off point for another morbid discussion about pop music dinosaurs."
4,"STING PROVES MUSIC IS A LANGUAGE, AND IS FLUENT IN THEM ALL","Stings ""Brand New Day"" is a Great Album, And shows love is still in the air, around Newcastle (Stings Home). I love Stings Romantic efforts, and once again he gives me more than one gift on the ""Brand New Day"". Which is a great mindset to see him in. I love Thousand Years, Desert Rose, And BRAND NEW DAY, and the IDea of ""After the Rain Has Fallen"", A romantic story of a thief, who may steal a princesses gold and Jewels, but reminds her , he has taken nothing that ""Love cant replace in the Blink of and Eye"". This Cd is worth Every Cent, and for all those with bad reviews, make a better Album, Writing Songs is Easy right? Great Effort STing..Thanks"
4,Deja Vu,"Sting being the gifted writer that he is can do better, and has. I would still recommend it to any Sting fan. This album, although a pleasant one to listen to, does not touch The Soul Cages album. The lyrics on Soul Cages rolled off the tongue like butter but here they just don't. A couple of the songs give you deja vu, you know you've heard those melodies somewhere before. Although, most of the songs are very pleasing and refreshing. The title track is spirited and charming while A Thousand Years is methodic and languid. Sting's buffet of music styles on this album does give the audience thier money's worth. His work is always a wise investment, he does not dissapoint on the whole."
5,A beautiful escape into melodic bliss!,"This album suprised me like no other Sting album. When I know a new album of his is coming out I always buy it without hesitation. ""Brand New Day"" is another superb musical achievement from Sting. His dabbling always turns to gold. I find myself carried away in the first two mystical tracks and humming along with ""Big Lie, Small World"". This is one CD that stays in my player for AT LEAST a month. Thanks Sting, you never let me down!"
4,All this time...,"... and he still produces music like this. Wow. Yeah, I'm a Sting fan, for one simple reason; no other artist makes music quite like Sting. OK, so some of the rhyming seems, well, contrived ('wound up dead, his dress was stained the colour red') but tracks like 'Desert Rose' and 'A Thousand Years' can still make your spine tingle just as much as 'Children's Crusade' or 'Shape of my Heart'. OK, perhaps not as much as 'Shape of my Heart'.I've heard it said that the album sounds 'too polished', like, what?!? When our UK charts are full of manufactured trash, Sting is a breath of fresh air, which is quite an achievement for such an established artist. I do miss the cool jamming of 'Dream of the Blue Turtles', but then I can always put that on when 'Brand New Day' finishes!"
3,"A worthy experiment, but not his best.","Sting does not hesitate to break new ground, but sometimes that doesn't make for the best music. He is strongest when sticking with a melody and lyric driven style. He could take a lesson from less self-indulgent singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Chuck Pyle."
4,Sting breathes a charming and spacious breath and evolves,"Sting breathes a charming and spacious breath with this album. As a whole, this collection of contemporary rock grooves with a wize resound. Sting's timeless style is evident although he is evolving into a more mature character. Brand new day is mellow, groovy, whispy yet still rocks in it's own quiet place. Outstanding production quality accents a refreshing array of synthetic and acoustic sounds."
5,Sting Still Has The Magic Touch....,"I wasn't impressed on my first listen....nothing as catchy as his past singles.But I sat down and listened again and am amazed how seamlessly all these styles of music meld together on this cd. (Jazz, worldbeat, country, gospel, hip-hop, and on and on...)The lyrics are simpler, more direct...who has time for poetry with the Millennium/Armageddon coming?A truly beautiful album...but nothing you can dance to.Well, maybe, slow dance...it's very romantic.Again, Sting, you've done it again!"
5,A Must Have,"My husband and I rarely agree about music. He likes heavy metal and I like pop and classic rock. This CD we both love!!! We play it almost everyday. The great thing about it is it has a little bit of everything. Jazz, Country and Pop I'm sure that those listening to the top 40 radio stations have heard the desert rose clip but the rest of the album is just as awesome."
4,Great Sting,One of the things you can count on String for is to come up with different stuff all the time. This is different from his earlier stuff but it is great.
2,Maybe it just wasn't for me.,"I totally loved Desert Rose and in response to one of the other reviewers this song was out long before 9/11 bombings, relax. I loved the middle eastern flair that he used in Desert Rose, and I think it opened up a lot of areas of music that have not and should have been explored previously. Now as for the rest of the album, well, it just wasn't for me. It's not bad but to have one song evoke so many sentiments and not have more to go along with it just leads to dissapointment. A thousand years wasn't that bad but I still wish it was more powerful and provocative. I would recommend it to someone who is a Sting fan true and through but if your intrest just got peaked by Desert Rose like mine did than just stick to the Single."
3,Better than the last one; just skip tracks 5-8,"Directions: Just skip songs 5-8, and you will enjoy this CD. After being disappointed by Sting's last album, Mercury Falling, I wasn't expecting very much. Just program that stereo to skip those songs (which are Mercury Falling-esque, i.e. horrible). If you haven't bought Mercury Falling, don't bother. If you are new to Sting try Blue Turtles or Ten Summoner's Tales. Then go out and buy Sting's best album: Soul Cages."
3,A few good songs but not like the old sting,"This Cd is ok, but definetly not like the old Sting that I usually listen too. His music has taken a different turn which doesn't appeal to me as older songs. Very different from his first albums. Though listen to the clips and you may still like it. But if your interested in music similar to his earlier work this is not for you."
4,Who is Sting?,"All of the other reviewers have hit the nail on the head. You dont really neccessarily have to acquire a taste for this type of music. I am one of Sting's young music listeners. I also grew up with this stuff...a good example would be "" Ten Summoner's Tales "" mmmm...brings back good memories. Any way, This album has my A+...and as an audiophile...thats hard to get in my books. If you ever run into somebody that has never heard of Sting's music, tell them its just like Billy Joel....only more up to date."
4,Fair effort.,"I was'nt really a fan of stings solo efforts not so long ago but now this album is starting to grow on me and this is an awesome release by the ex police band member however i would personally get something by the police before you look at this as lets face it they are a better band who played from a reggae/punk influence compared with sting who tends to focus around the pop genre, theres nothing wrong with this it just just makes the cd not so listenable on say a regular basis but anything by sting should'nt be missed really (check out how one track on this album sounds kinda like a bb king number)."
2,His weakest effort,"There are 3 or 4 good songs, the rest are uninspired and boring. It's his weakest songwriting yet. The lyrics are OK but the songs last for about 8 bars and then repeat over and over. I'm a big fan and this was a real disappointment."
2,What happened?,"Danger! Danger! Don't listen to this CD while driving--you risk falling asleep. While this is not outright horrible, it lacks inspiration. I'm a huge Sting fan, but I find this album really dull.I waited for it 3 years, too..."
3,Not bad,"This compilation is pretty decent. Although ""Desert Rose"" stands out as one of the best pieces, thanks in part to Cheb Mami, this collection otherwise has some good tracks, is mellow and low key. This is not one of Sting's best albums, but is worth owning nevertheless. Sting is a very talented and genuine artist."
3,One Step Back,"Although I would not say that Sting ""can't make a decent album anymore,"" I do have to admit that he did not think deep enough into his compositons. I always applaud him for his varied styles and ventures into the unusual. However, it seems that much of this recording was focused on variety of styles and not on substantive composition. Honestly, it always takes me a few listenings to really like and appreciate his new music. Unfortunately the liking never came to me with this one. Hang in there, he will do better next time."
3,A step down from Mercury Falling,"Don't get me wrong, Upon repeated listenings, it is clear that this CD will satisfy the need for a new dose of Sting. The reasons it falls short albums like Nothing Like the Sun and Ten Somoners Tales are as follows: 1. The obvious use of a programmed drums (drum machine)on some tracks. A world class drummer is much more effective then any drum machine. 2. Over all sophistication of the tunes. Granted, I'd say there are three, maybe four selections that rise to some of his previous efforts, but the one's that don't meet that expectation Really don't. ""Later Sting"" is starting to look like ""Later Billy Joel"" Let's hope he can break the funk."
2,Sting in a trance,"There's something fishy about this music? The band has gone missing. If you listen to his last 2 cds Mercury & Ten Summoners the music kicks in & is confident, the material varied as usual, yet consistent & strong.A disappointment.Throw kipper back into the Sea of meditation---There's only one Kipper anyway,he's in UFO! (kipper?has a producer/keyboards credit--ahead of the band?) Send it back."
2,rather annoying,"I appreciate the talent that Sting has as a musician and a composer. Songs like ""If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"", ""Englishman In New York"", ""Fields of Gold"", ""Set Them Free"" and ""Love Is The Seventh Wave"" are Sting at his best. However, I find the two singles released off of this album- the title track and another one which has a yodeling style vocal to leave me unimpressed. This latest single is one of the most annoying songs currently on radio and, to my ears, lacks any soul whatsoever. ""Brand New Day"" is mediocre at best. Many songs, when pushed constantly on radio, will grow on me eventually. These songs have had the opposite effect- I abhor them more and more. I'm sorry to be so negative, but these songs are terribly disappointing. I admit that I haven't heard the whole album, but if these two songs are any indication of what's on the rest of the album- NO THANK YOU!"
1,"people, it's over.","As much as it pains me, Sting just can't make a decent album anymore. I agree with a lot of folks here: there are some good songs--> better just enjoy them on the radio though.I'm afraid the days of a consistently strong Sting album is over--and it's not the musicians fault here. Simply bad writing. The loss of focus is apparent. Forget about the Queen, God Save Sting."
2,Sting's latest collapses in the weight of its own excess,"This is Sting's worst album. An over-produced, over-written bore, with too many references to new days dawning and Millenia approaching. One gets the feeling that Sting got caught up in his own celebrity status again and wanted to write some kind of ""time capsule"" album which we are to keep to remind us of the Brand New Day which approacheth. Well, this album definitely belongs underground. Just what happened to the Sting of ""Soul Cages""?"
1,"Some call it ""Growing;"" sounds more like, ""Lost.""","Eclectic doesn't begin to describe Sting's choice of material here. I guess in searching for a new direction, he headed out in all directions at once. Heck, it might work eventually - one of them must be the right direction."
2,Brand New Bore...,"Sting has finally come undone. ""Brand New Day"" is another pre-fab recording full of lifeless lyrics wrapped in uppity pop beats. So much so, even his austere politics, which he childishly attempts to wrap in his music, suddenly seem irrelevant.Listeners are best to skip this CD."
2,Brand New Day is Okay,"There are only two cuts on this album that are worth listening to. Brand New Day is the best. Otherwise, this album is a waste of time."
1,This album is not inspired but it is self-indulgent,"Some times I wonder what Sting did in his previous lives! Let's face it, he has looks, talent, vision and poise, but his selfindulgent album is a big disappointment. Mediocre songs and lyrics. Probably had little to say and a contract deadline. He can do, and we expect, much much better."
1,This STUPID CD Deserves Negative 5 Stars,"My friends bought this Cd and told me that it was great. So I took their advice and bought it. Um...it stunk. All I got from it was an old guy trying to be hip. Obviously, it backfired. I only made it through three songs, then I had to vomit and throw the dumb piece of garbage out the 56 story window. SAVE MONEY DON""T BUY THE CD!!!"
1,BORING!,"It's time for Sting to hag it up and get back to the best music he played in his life... Of course, this can't be done until he re-recruits Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers--the rest of the boys in the band he left too prematurely. A Police reunion is long over due, and it would be an event that would restore hope in Sting and dismiss his rather dull solo career (Hands down the man's a genius but far too muchof his solo stuff is just for the birds.). Police Reunion! Police Reunion!"
3,Sting felt down a bit...,"While Sting always made a solid pop albums with a bit of his own ""Soul"", on ""Brand new day"" he lost his Soul a bit somewhere under all modern production.don't get me wrong - it is a good Cd,Sting always knew how to make them but it is far far away from ""Dream of blue turtles"" or ""Soul cages"".songs are good but not excellent.they all are lacking a bit of originality and sometimes are even boring.in few words - a good music for cameral parties or quiet evening with newspaper."
4,"The Gentleman Rocker does it again, and again, and again","Brand New Day, like Sting, defies explanation. The album blends a myriad of sounds and harmonies to produce a collection of music that is neither great nor horrible. It would be hard, although not impossible for an artist of Sting's ilk to produce a horrible piece of work. Perhaps, that is Sting's greatest misfortune. Having produced such an admirable body of work, it is almost impossible for him to meet, if not exceed the standards of those works. Brand New Day is a solid piece of artistry, but lacks the personality that earlier works like Soul Cages or even Mercury Falling evoked. The work never succeeds in creating the searing emotion that pervaded Soul Cages or Dream of the Blue Turtles. The album has moments of absolute brillance like the haunting, lyrical piece Ghost Story, and the soaring harmonies of Desert Rose. All in all it is a good effort, but Soul Cages it is not."
4,"As always, Sting is amazing","This album is fantastic. I don't understand how someone who claims to be a Sting fan and to have enjoyed all of his previous albums could be disappointed in this. As is his standard, Sting delves into different styles and makes them his own. He continues to experiment and bring us sounds that many may not otherwise have the pleasure to experience. I especially love Desert Rose. If there is a downside to this album it is Fill Her Up. It would be fine except for the ""Fill her up with Jesus"" line - it didn't seem to fit into my image of what Sting is about."
2,Beautiful nothing.,"A major dissapointment. However beautiful and complex the arrangements, there is not a single haunting or memorable melody to be found. It's like state-of-the-art sonic wallpaper with some isolated pleasurable harmonies. The lyrics seem patronizing because Sting sings them so impersonally. I have listened a few times and it just evaporates after each song passes. Some may find it progressive. I think it's just lazy and tedious."
4,solid,"i'm a little embarrased at how bothered i am by the amazon review of this album. the time signatures (not that odd) will please most mature listeners. If Sting is self indulgent, i cant imagine what she thinks of sugar ray, puff daddy, etc. Brand New Day isn't supposed to be autobiographical. this is a solid album."
4,GREAT CD for Sting Fans,"I thought overall this CD is great. His ability to dable in country, blues, and a little rap just shows his tremendous ability. ""Desert Rose"" is one of my favorite songs on the CD and ""Brand New Day"" with Stevie Wonder on Harmonica is a great finish to a VERY GOOD CD."
5,Melodically Rich,"I don't one can compare one Sting work to the next... he never attempts to do the same thing twice. In this attempt he has yet again created deep, rich and thoughtful music."
2,"With each release, waning interest","I've been a huge Sting/Police fan since I was 10 years old, and this release just depresses me. Superior performances and production aside,for me, Sting's appeal always lay in his superior melodies . With Ten Summoner's Tales the highwater mark, Mercury Falling had a few strong tracks, and Brand New Day is even weaker, without nary a hummable hook or melody that sticks in your brain after the listen. Granted, even lame Sting is miles better than strong efforts of mortal bands, but BND doesn't reach the impossibly high standard that his earlier works achieved. Perhaps it's becuase his longtime producer Hugh Padgham is missing from this one. Regardless, a disappointment. Here's hoping the next one's better!"
5,Sting Continues to Evolve,"The best thing about Sting's music is that he can explore new sounds and still put a few definitive ""Sting-like"" songs on his albums. That way you get pulled into the new sounds while listening for the stuff you already know you're going to like.I was given this CD by my husband the day it was released because I'm a big Sting fan already (I have all his CDs and the Police box set). Although some of the songs (Perfect Love . . . Gone Wrong and Fill Her Up, for instance) take some getting used to, all in all it's a great CD.My favorite song is Ghost Story because it sounds like a tone poem (if you listen to other Sting CDs, you'll know what I mean when you hear this song; it'll never make it to the radio). The music is beautiful and the lyrics match.A must buy for anyone who likes Sting's music and who also likes to be taken on a musical ride into something new."
2,"Like most of us do, STING has mellowed with age . . .","Poor Sting, he's always getting dumped on in the music press these days for being pretentious and uncool. Well, music critics are some of the most useless and pretentious people ever, so screw 'em. It's about the music, ya dummies, and I'll always love Sting's music, especially his older stuff.But sadly, most of this album verges on being ""adult contemporary."" Maybe that's appealing to some, but it's far from my cup of tea. I probably won't ever put this one on again, but I'll always go back to albums like DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES and . . . NOTHING LIKE THE SUN along with nearly everything the Police put out."
3,dont't get me wrong but...,"...i like sting's work... but this albumn to me was a disapointment. 'brand new day' harks back to the 'good old days' if you will, definitely a great track... but the two other stand out tracks ('desert rose' & 'thousand years') unfortunatly can not rescue this from being a disapointingly... average albumn."
1,BOOOOR-ing,"Dull, drab, and dark. The title track is the only good song really. This a drum-loop, sequencer happy, techno album more or less. Boo. Hiss. Sting's earlier work is much better than this. Where's the band on this album? It's all keyboards and Sting has forgotten how to groove."
1,Sting's soul is in a cage,"SOmewhere before or during the Mercury Falling era Sting lost something emotionally and spiritualy, he was about 45 at the time, I can't put my finger on it, maybe his strange yoga/tantric practices did something to him or maybe he was just unable to cope with lost youth. Still Mercury Falling came out as a fairly decent product, his dignity intact.Brand new day is unexplainable, there is only one truly good inspired song (1000 years), then there is Desert Rose which is fairly good, but the rest is pure trash, and can be harmful to any person with good musical taste or ear.What happened to you Sting? Did you pact with the devil?"
3,It's time to reinvent.,Disappointing and unadventurous. He can do better. Dreadful mixes. Where was Hugh?
3,Better Lyrics than Mercury; worse music.,"Except for a flawed beginning on One Thousand Days, the lyrics are uniformly quite good; rhythmic and euphonious (despite Sting's best efforts to effect the contrary on Big Lie Small World). Desert Rose, 1000 Days (after the modulation), After the Rain Has Fallen, Fill her Up, Ghost Story, and Brand New Day have excellent lyrical experiments, with solid rhythm and good off-rhyme, but the music fails to match the high standards of Mercury. Weak melodies, strong harmonies and variations. Hopefully the next album will give us both the rich melodies of Mercury and the wise and inspired lyrics of BND. Until then, Soul Cages is the best!"
2,Unimaginative,"I am a fan of Sting's previous works (although I do not have Mercury Rising); however, I was quite disappointed by this CD. The lyrics are nothing special and the tunes sound very much the same. It comes across as if he did not put much thought into the content of the songs. Granted, much time was spent engineering this CD, almost to its detriment. ""Fill Her Up"" is simply dreadful, Ringo Starr's ""Act Naturally"" is a better attempt at a ""country"" song (and that is not saying much.)"
2,Sting added in sophistication but lost in soul quality,"I have always considered Sting as the most profound writer in the last two decades. His music seemed to always strike cords with my soul frequencies. Sting would usually capitalize on his European depth. I am not sure what happened to him on this cd. I thought that Mercury Falling was sub-par, but this cd is even worse. What has become of Sting. This cd would more than likely please some yuppies. What about the rest of us, loyal listeners at heart; people, who has been following Sting from his wild Police days. Where is that fire...where is that sting?"
3,a mediocre albumn,"I am a huge fan of Sting and was highly anticipating the arrival of this new CD, but after listening to it, I was somewhat dissappointed. I felt it was hard to listen to, seemed rather repetitious, and didn't have that ingenuity that most his albumns covered. But I still have faith in you Sting."
2,Too ecclectic,After 2 listens this album seems a bit incoherent. Sound is a little funky too. Sounds like the drums are in an aluminum building. Lyrics are interesting. I am sure it will grow on me. Just hasn't yet.
1,"Take Sominex (i.e. Brand New Day), and sleep, sleep, sleep.","Brand New Day is, without a doubt, the most powerful drug-free tranquilizer currently available to human beings. Simply turn it on, tune it in, and you will eventually zonk out.This CD is a depressing trip into the psyche of a middle-aged man who--on his ever-spiraling inward journey of self-realization--has yet to discover anything that could be categorized as a breakthrough.Hey Sting, I don't care about your mid-life crisis, your spirituality and your improved sex drive! I want better music for my money! See if you can find out where you left your wry wit, your sense of humor and your insights on the human condition (not just your condition). And if you're thinking about touring with Yanni, DON'T."
3,So What....,"So what...it isn't ""Nothing Like the Sun"" or ""Ten Summoner's Tales""...what..the guy is supposed to repeat every dam well-reviewed thing he's done? Yea, the CD gets boring at times and yea he may have lost some of his ""perfect song"" techniques (A french rap?; Another sterile sounding country song?), but let's face it..a mediocre Sting album is a better buy than most of the schlock out there anyday.Oh, and if you get some extra spendin' $$, pick up the ""Desert Rose"" remixes done by Victor Calderone. They are almost as awesome as the original song!"
2,A disappointment,"Having followed Sting since the Police days, and having gotten used to his every release being a bit better, or at least more challenging, this one unfortunately really let me down.Don't get me wrong, I'm still a very big Sting fan. But this CD is frankly boring. It's almost elevator music. What's tough to understand is how Stink (sic) could have surrounded himself with such (albeit aging) talent yet still have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Maybe it's James Taylor's fault, having added his ex-junkie wimper soft rock influence.And golly, Sting, please don't try any more rap. It's beneath your dignity, no matter what language it's in. Let rappers do their c-rap, pleeeeze.But he who never takes risks does not learn much. Let's just all hope that this release was a great learning experience for Sting. Let's hope that he rebounds with more CDs along the lines of Soul Cages, Ten Summoner's Tales, or even Mercury Falling."
4,Brand New Day,"Wow! What a mixture of music. Typical of Sting. I love the way he mixes different sounds and types of music. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is one track I didn't particularly care for. A first for Sting and me. I really think he is brilliant!"
5,Magnificent - what else is there to say?,"Sting is the one artist whose albums I eagerly anticipate and once again, my wait has been well-rewarded. His lyrics and melodies are always wonderful and I especially like his use of different musical styles on this album - even the ""rap"". ""A Thousand Days"" and ""Desert Rose"" are simply gorgeous, and ""A Brand New Day"" is the perfect ending to a very upbeat collection of songs. To one of your previous reviewers I say, YES, Stevie's harmonica adds just the right touch to this song."
4,You gotta listen to this more than once!,"You've gotta listen to this more than once, because this album won't knock you over with catchy hooks. It's a lyric-intensive musical journey about relationships. After about 7 listenings, I love it. The melodies and words haunt your brain and you realize that Sting has done it again. His voice is still the most amazing instrument in music.I just saw Sting's opening concert in Los Angeles, and it may be the best concert I""ve ever seen. He did 6 of the 10 songs from Brand New Day and tore it up for a little over two hours -- an incredible performance. He dipped into the Police bag with Every Breath, Mad About You, Bring on the Night, and Every Little Thing She Does is Magic. He finished with an acoustic Message in a Bottle followed by an acoustic version of Fragile. Get this album and go see Sting. You won't be disappointed."
2,"Bland, a watered down version of his previous","Sting seems to be running on Autopilot. I bought this CD and struggled thru it, giving it to a friend - she had the same reaction."
4,Brand New Day is certainly different than Sting's past work,Great songs and one country. Sting's music style is the same but with a slight twist. He takes pop to another level. His compilation of the Algerian music is awesome. I wish he was coming to Seattle for a concert.
2,Sting fails to deliver new sound on new day,"Sting's new cd, Brand New Day, fails to deliver big time. The first two tracks have an amazing sound that only sting can deliver. But after that you can throw this cd away. Sting's melodies and hooks are not catchy and are nothing that you will want to listen to more than a few times. Do yourself a favor and save your money."
4,A pleasant return to form by this former Police man.,"Though ""Nothing Like the Sun"" remains Sting's best album to date, this new release captures the singer in a relaxed groove, doing what he does best and even adding third world chant to one very effective track. Only the obligitory pseudo country twang of one number mars the mood. There are two songs on the title single that didn't make it onto the album (ah, marketing), and they're worthwhile too. Good to hear Sting not over reaching as he has done on his most recent records. I'll be playing this one for a long time."
4,"High highs, low lows.","The CD goes from amazing songs to crummy ones. Desert Rose, Brand New Day and A Thousand Years are definetely the best. The thing is, one track is only 19 seconds, so you essentially have nine songs. For the number of songs on the album, he does too much experimenting. Fill Her Up, goes from country, to angelic, to what sounds like a black choir-in four minutes! Songs about guys who dress up as women don't tickle me that much. (Tomorrow We'll See). Sting should stick to songs more like Desert Rose and A Thpusand Years. Lyckily, most tunes are pretty catchy."
4,Fantastic album from a fantastic artist,"Brand New Day, Sting's newest effort, is a grand achievement. The mixture of Middle Eastern flair with jazz, hip-hop, and country shows Sting's creativity. As usual his band is top notch. Vinnie Colaiuta and Manu Cache on drums are superb. The title cut is my favorite. It is catchy and fun. Lyricly, it is not as sophisticated at past albums, but he achieves his purpose. I have to concur with a previous reviewer that Soul Cages was by far his best album, yet Brand New Day offers an interesting array of genres to appeal to many. An album worth buying if your a Sting fan or not."
4,Welcome back,"Each song offers a different musical style and mood. The last album had many musical styles, but it wasn't as satisfying as this one. This time it's highly successful and makes this album thrilling, powerful and clear. Turn the clock to zero and Enjoy this Brand New Day!"
3,My take on this CD,"I'll first write my review of the CD. Unlike others, I think Tomorrow We'll See is one of the best cuts. Sting seems to live this piece; there is some pretty good evocation here, I really get the feel that this whore - let's say it for what she is - is the one telling the story, not really Sting. Or possibly Sting invokes this hooker for the song. At any rate, no happy hookers here, we get the danger of the life, yet this street walker can't really face up to the insanity of her life; ""looking pretty's my only crime."" Additionally, the mix of unique orchestration, and jazz and rock musicianship makes it one of the best cuts."
3,In a nutshell...,"Too much electronic sound. Too much pseudo-country. Too much channeling for prostitutes (Remember a little song called Roxanne? Different point of view but same topic. Whazzup wit' dat?) Too much french rap. Too little to move to. Too many bare feet on the CD case. Only 10 tracks. the dude is super-talented...I have every album he's ever made, but this one is my least favorite. As others before me have commented, he seems to be in some sort of transition phase, which he has a right to be in. Unfortunately, I even like ""mercury Falling"" better than this. Roll Tide. I just paid 110 dollars for Sting tickets in New Orleans, so I have learned nothing. Can't wait for his next album, which no doubt will feature pygmies playing cellos with Yo Yo Ma while camels fart in the background."
2,"Listen first, buy second.","I bought this one without hearing single note of it... simply based on the fact that I have purchased everything Sting has released. That makes me a fan, right? But _Brand New Day_ leaves me cold. Difficult to believe that this is a man that once fronted a *punk rock outfit.* Not that I need more of the same - I somewhat enjoyed the oft-maligned _Mercury Falling_, in fact - but at some point Sting seemed to care a whole lot more about music. The worldbeat-influence on songs like ""Desert Rose"" comes off as a cloying artifice. I can buy into ""Roxanne"" a lot easier than I can into ""Tommorrow We'll See."" And the country-gospel turn of ""Fill Her Up"" could not possibly seem more disingenuous - well, I guess Sean Combs could remix it. Anyway, perhaps excepting that little _Brimstone and Treacle_ affair, _Brand New Day_ is my least favorite album by Sting. At least with _B & T_ you have all the screaming..."
2,Disappointment.,I consider myself a Sting fan. I have all his solo albums and I enjoy them all. Some obviously have stronger songs than others but overall they are albums that I can place in my CD player and enjoy. This latest album greatly disappointed me. I was unable to find one song I could enjoy listening to on a consistant basis. I expected more from Sting.
2,Sting's Worst solo album...,"Let me start by saying that I love Sting and every album he's ever done (until now!). After 3 days of listening, hoping, waiting... I only found three songs that I actually like: Song 1 2 and 10 - the title track. It's eclectic, fine... but the song writing simply isnt that good. I do understand that Sting likes to stretch the perception of his listeners but this just doesn't do it for me. Oh well, everybody's got to miss sometime - even Sting!"
3,The CD is OK but there is a lot of fluff,"""Brand New Day"" is good but it doesn't compare to Sting's other albums. The only tracks that Sting really achieves his past greatness are ""A Thousand Years"", ""The Desert Rose"", and ""After the Rain Has Fallen"". The rest are filler. The album is worth getting just for the three songs I mentioned but to be honest, his previous albums have given ""more bang for the buck""."
4,Best effort since Nothing Like The Sun,"SMOOTH! If you enjoyed the jazz-flavored ""Dream of the Blue Turtle"" and ""Nothing like the Sun,"" you'll love ""Brand New Day."" Sting experiments with some new sounds (techno, chant, french rap) as well as some old favorites (Branford Marsalis on clarinet, and drum licks that would make Stewart Copeland proud). The production is flawless, the musicians are top-notch, and Sting has returned to his old style of songwriting (topics include life, love, and the world's oldest profession). This CD has restored my faith in Sting--welcome back!"
3,Gordon's getting older if not wiser,"""Brand New Day"" starts off sounding like one of Sting's best recordings since ""The Soul Cages"". His slight experimentation into electronica sounds a bit forced but the lyrics are strong enough to carry the song through. While the rest of the disc doesn't quite hit the peaks of his older sessions it is still good enough to belong in any Sting collection. There are bumps in the road to be sure, but it is much better than ""Mercury Falling"""
3,"Not all bad, but not great either...","I have been a huge Sting fan for longer than I'd care to admit to. While I did find some of the tracks appealing (1, 2 & 10), Sting failed to capture my soul as he had in previous musical attempts. Brand New Day is not all bad, but it's difficult to listen to some of the tracks, particularly the French rap and the country songs. All I can do at this point is to wait another few years and hope that Sting regains his edge."
3,"Some very good, some rather bad","The newest Sting album is an odd thing. The new single 'Brand new day' is a brilliant popsong, as goes for 'afer the rain has fallen'. In 'Desert rose', Sting kind of imitates Peter Gabriel with this piece of World Music. But we shouldn't complain about that, 'cause it is one of Sting's best, as well as one of the best songs I've heard this year. 'A thousand years' is also a wonderfull, mysterious song. 'Big lie, Small world' is reasonably good. The other songs on the album are less than that. In 'Fill 'Er Up', Sting plays the singing cowboy, which doesn't work out well. 'Perfect Love, Gone bad' has french rap in it. Surprising, but I haven't made up my mind yet if I should like it or not. There are also some other 'easy songs' on the album, which are reasonable. Conclusion: If you're a Sting-fan (I am), buy this album. If you're enfamiliar with his music, listen to 'Fields Of Gold' first."
4,"Love James Taylor, but why throw in a country track?","Great adult contemporary album. Nice flow, even the French rap works on one track, but the country tune should have been left off. I like country music, but don't like it pushed on me, and interrupting the mood of the CD. Buy the album, just program your stereo to skep this track."
2,He can do better than this,"I have been a fan of Sting since he began his solo career. Until this album, I was of the opinion that each album was even better than the last. However, this album, long overdue, is a major disappointment. If it hadn't been 3 and a half years in the making, if he was more prolific, then maybe I wouldn't be so saddened by this album. But I fear that this is all we will have for several more years. There are some good songs, I really love ""A Thousand Years"" and ""Brand New Day"". But the rest of the album leaves much to be desired. I hope this is not a sign of things to come from a man whose music I have enjoyed so much."
2,What's All the Hype about?,"I read this book based on recommendations from other readers. Frankly, I don't understand why they love the book. The characters are under-developed and the plot is lacking creativity. I think St. Jude is living his life through the main character. It's an OK read, but not great."
2,"insulting, to say the least.","i admit, it was one of the most well-written books i have ever read. peck definately has a way with words (that's where the two stars come from). i just think he uses them for the wrong thing. one word that i can describe the book in is bitter. i could also add hateful, biast, judjemental, misleading... it made me angry and the only reason i read the whole dang thing is i kept thinking it might get better. he might actually open his eyes. fat chance. the whole book is one big complaint about his childhood and he runs over everybody in the process. and then all of a sudden at the end it gets all happy and touchy-feely and i can't figure out why. all he does is find any way he can to insult christians, giving himself excuses for his stupidity and making himself out to be God. i wouldn't be surprised if half of it was made up. and if it's not, this guy needs to find a better way to crucify people."
1,that'll teach me to cheap out...,"i'm writing this review b/c i had such a difficult time w/ the stand and am now looking for something better. i bought a 5 ft tree, and it has been beyond difficult to get the tree to stand up straight. (it's so precarious, i don't dare put glass bulbs on it.) this is after i tried to jimmy the green thing so that it would fit the (what i don't consider to be outrageously thick) tree trunk. (i ended up sawing off around the circumference of the tree, SUCH a hassle.) the screws don't ""screw"" properly - it seems like the thread is relatively easy to strip. i think the only way this stand would work is if you are using a tiny, lightweight tree."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I was very disappointed when ai received this. The description says it's a seven-inch tree stand, but I think they must mean 7 inches tall. The width of the space for the tree trunk is no more than four inches. And the bowl that the tree sits in is tiny. If we put our tree in this stand, we will have to fill it at least three times a day. The construction is also very cheap, and I'm concerned abothe tree breaking the stand. I had hoped to get a tree stand for not too much money, but I'm just going to bite the bullet now and buy a more expensive but higher-quality stand that can fit a larger tree and hold more water and not look like it will break when I put the tree in it."
1,Absolutely the worst,"We've suffered with this tree stand for several years and it's getting replaced this year. It is too flimsy to support any tree becuase the legs don't hold themselve fixed in the water basin. If you're looking for frustration, arguments, a wobbly tree, and wasted time setting it up, buy this stand. Or, you can dig mine out of the garbage because that's where its going. Giving 1 star because I can't give 0."
1,Ruins the tree experience,"After 30 frustrating minutes of enlarging the holes to fit the screws, we finally got the thing assembled. I can only HOPE that it holds up the tree and doesn't spill water everywhere. It's cheap because it's poorly manufactured."
2,Not a Budge version for Egyptophiles,"There are no hieroglyphs, phonetically written Kemetic words anywhere in this text. There is no foreword, editorial commentary, footnotes and citations on translation/ language nuances, etc. It's great if you just want to read the Pert em Hru (Book of the Dead) in English - no muss, no fuss. But from an scholarly standpoint, or for someone who wants to see the original glyphs as they read the translation, this Budge version is useless. I wish the book's description had made that clear to potential buyers."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Don't understand the reviews here. I bought the same product about 6 months ago and mine is a certified piece of crap. The volume is VERY low, even with the ""Dynamic Bass Boost"" on. I can turn the volume all the way up and still hear the faintest street noise on the cheap headphones that it comes with. Also, the skip protection does not work at all. Not on store bought CDs and certainly not on downloaded music burned to a CDR. I have never seen so many OOPS messages in my life. Have owned about 5 portable CD players and only one was worse than this one. Only reason this one is better is because of the radio. This unit is pretty good on batteries, but the only thing the salvages this purchase is the AM/FM tuner. If not for that radio, this would be the worse CD player I've ever owned. Have always thought very highly of Philips products, but they dropped the ball on this one"
2,A Hard Game,I did not like this game very much. They only give you three lives when you should have double that amount. I only got to Level 5. The mazes are tiny and hard to move around in. I would not buy this game again.
1,THEY ARE NOTHING WITHOUT KIM ESTY,"Kim Esty was the true star of the group. She has the voice and talent....exactly what it takes to make it in this industry. The Boomtang Boys are not very smart to let her go. They hired ""this"" singer and ""that"" singer but the real talent was with Kim Esty. Their talent alone is truely lacking...but might be good for the local bar...in Sudbury. And what is this crap about ""Best Hits"" album....hey guys....first get some hits and work hard to make many albums...and when you have MANY hits then, and only then, can you make a greatest hits album. Believe me, I am an executive in the music industry and I know what I am talking about. The Boomtang Boys???? It really should have been ""Kim Esty and the Boomtang Boys"" Now THAT would have been a success!ExecutiveVirgin"
5,VERY VERY PLEASANT POP!,"This is one of those rare albums where every track is good. The music is lively, the various singers are actually talented, and all songs have a different sound despite being produced by the same producers.It's not quite a dance album, although these are dance tracks. The arrangements are too ""fluffy"" and the beats aren't booming enough for the dancefloors, even if extended versions were available. Aside from the cover versions (Dancing With Myself, Time After Time, Both Sides Now, amongst others), the original material is good and pleasant. Two of my favorites are ""I Was A Fool"" and ""Squeeze Toy"" which was a major hit in Canada -- the inclusion of the French version ""Mon Joujou"" on the Canadian pressing is a nice little surprise.For someone looking for a nice, inoffensive, ""quiet"" dance album, this is it."
3,Boomtang...........um....................ok,"The remake of Billy Idol's ""Dancing With Myself"" is your typical funny dance remake, they also remake Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" and the classic rock song ""Bang A Gong"". Those on the other hand, are not good. But, the reason why I bought this was because of ""Popcorn"". It's a cool song (the music sounds a little bit too much like Daft Punk though). The remix of ""Popcorn"" (track 12) isn't nearly as good as the original. Overall, it's worth buying for ""Popcorn"" & ""Dancing With Myself""."
5,Greatest Hits is Right!,I really don't have anything to say except the songs are awesome and I hope they make a volume two sometime in the future. The Boomtang Boys were kind of a fab but now the fab has ended and I still like their music.
3,"Nice companion to the original, but not necessary","To answer at least one of Rob O'Connor's questions from the above Amazon.com review: Stayin' Alive is included because it is featured in the movie. Imagine that, a song on a soundtrack that was in the movie... strange thing indeed. The same goes for the Heart song Majic Man. Beyond that the rest of this ""soundtrack"" are songs that the creators of the movie used as ""inspiration"". Royal Crown Revue is included here since RCR was the band the Jon Favreau used to dance to at the Derby before Big Bad Voodoo Daddy took over. Other songs are tunes that they wanted to include but could not afford at the time. All in all it's a nice companion to the original. There is a nice photo booklet included. This album is not meant to be a scrapbook of the ""swing scene"" and lindy hoppers, but a portrait of the music in and around the retro-lounge lifestyle."
2,Not Bad...good Swingers music...more 2 1/2 stars than 2,"This 2nd Swingers Soundtrack is not bad. It only has maby 2 or 3 songs that are acutally in the movie, but its not bad. I personally like the first soundtrack better. It has more songs from the movie and is just all around better. This one is good to but I like the first one better and I think you will to."
4,The ultimate soundtrack sequel!,Finally there is a soundtrack sequel out there that I liked the first one enough to buy the secound. It isn't quite as good as the first one yet it is very enjoyable. I couldn't help but buy it when I saw it on the sales racks. Check it out if you like the original. The only complaint is that it is too short. Some dialogue from the film would be nice.
1,Save your money!,"If you're gonna get this game, get on PlayStation if you have the original system! The controls on GameBoy are next to impossible!"
1,This the worst (...),"This game [is horrible]. IT is so incredibly horrible that it makes ET on teh Atarii 2600 look good.FOr a PSX game the graphics [are bad]. The over the top view is fine but it looks like it could easily be on the NES (Conviently trannsfered to Gameboy COlor by the way)I hate the music in it. The same style makes for a non stop bore fest. I took it back within three hours after renting it.The controls are what kill it though. YOu will smashj the controller in three seconds after playing it.Avoid with all cost. Trust me, as a hardcore gamer for 19 years you will trust my advice and avoid, go for Grand Theft Auto 3 if any of the series."
3,Mid to late Bf109 profiles,"If you are interested in different colour schemes for the F through to the K versions of the Messerschmitt Bf109, then this is the book for you. As always, colours are subject to personal interpretation as these are invariably translated from black and white photographs - but all in all, most profiles seem to be a sensible representation.The artwork may appear flat and does not reach levels of aviation artists like Richard J. Caruana. The perspective layout is also on the weak side, particularly the under-surfaces. The weathering effect can be annoying as it is done on a permanent layer and is repeated on every profile. Finally, there are occasional schemes where it is too obvious that the only changes are the aircraft number and all else is merely repetition.All in all however, the effort is commendable and the publication is in fact a good reference source from the scheme aspect."
1,overrated,"With his pedestrian melodies and overrated wailing, Bill Champlin shows what led to the corporate power balad drivelfest that made Chicaco a gag relex after years of enjoyment. Lamm's new album is more subtle, intricate and enjoyable."
4,Terrific At Exploding Many Stereotypes,"As a parent I wanted my four-year-old daughter to see other kids who ""looked like her"" and yet others who didn't. She enjoys the same things as the kids pictured: spending time with family, playing games, and dancing. The pictures are wonderful, not just from my perspective but also from hers.My only disappointment was that she didn't see parents with disabilities like her father, nor kids with disabilities. Of course kids with disabilities spend time with family, dance, and play games. That they wouldn't is a pernicious stereotype. I wish the photographers had combated it."
3,So so clipboard,It broke the clip to hold papers after a week and only held 4 papers so it was not over holding. What a shame it was a gift
5,Timeless Wisdom For Eternal Application. 10 Stars!,"Written centuries ago, the Tao Te Ching, written by Lao Tsu, brings humanity profoundly enlightened wisdom that when applied, will lift you into BEING, and free you from the pain of seeking.This 25th anniversary edition is beautiful, with illustrations, calligraphy, and breathtaking quotes that you can share with others to uplift their lives. A GREAT book to bring with you and look through whether you are waiting in an office for an appointment, in stand-still traffic, or especially if you are out in nature, and want to inhale the wisdom that best accompanies a natural environment.The words are timeless and priceless because of the profound truth they bring.You will learn much, and gain a great deal from the wisdom in this book.Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English did an outstanding job in translation. Highly Recommended!"
4,"Read for comparison, keep for the artwork","Although somewhat brief, this translation of the Tao Te Ching is concise, not lacking. It is a good complement to the Arthur Waley translation, and well worth reading. Read, compare, and keep for the art."
2,"beautiful book, overdone translation","i bought this book because i loved its look - the art and calligraphy. sadly, that's about all i've gotten from it. i found the translation dull and unhelpful - overdone, like most of the tao te ching translations that i've read.my favorite translation - translation, after all, being the real point of getting this book - is by ren jiyu, and the book is titled ""the book of laozi."" much more direct and effective!"
3,just my opinion,"The translation of this book should be exactly that, trying to communicate the ideas of the Tao not couching the concepts in obscure flowery verbage that only someone who already understands the Tao Te Ching would grasp.The reason I say this is because I've read other versions which made an attempt to help you understand this book instead of coming across as so esoteric that you don't get it and assume the author is really smart. The pictures are nice if that helps you attain a higher level of awareness and the new age drivel written by friends of the author make me want to tear my eyes out. I suggest The Complete Works of Lao Tzu by Hua Ching Ni"
5,Hands Down - Best Interpretation,"I've read over 20 interpretations of the Dao, and this is easily the clearest. The wording is very understandable for the Western mind.The combination of images, calligraphy, and organization makes it a pleasurable book to read. If you are just getting started into Eastern thought, or if you are an experienced thinker in the area this book will serve you well.It's always good to read other versions, just for the way that other authors interpret the text's meaning. However, I always return to this one for true understanding - it makes sense. You won't be disappointed with this text at all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Made for a Western audience,"This rendition of the Tao Te Ching is beautiful and accessible, although some points in the translation are questionable. It seems this version was made for the Western audience rather than sticking closely to the original. For those who love the Chinese text, this may be problematic. The strength of the original lies in its ambiguity--in the presence of light and darkness, a play of light and darkness, an indistinctness of light and darkness. This version seems to choose the light over the dark. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold, which is an excellent collection of Eastern wisdom."
5,Beautiful,I just wish I had bought the hard cover (too) b/c this book is so beautifully written and the pictures are so lovely that I leave it on my coffee table and a hard cover would have looked better displayed.
5,Well done,"This is a really beautiful edition of this wonderful text. While the translation is not ideal, it is certainly a reliable rendering of the text and an edition that I would recommend as a gift."
5,The Beauty of Tao,"This beautiful book introduced me to Tao. As a child, my father would let me page through it just to look at the gorgeous and simple photography. It wasn't until many years later that I actually began to read and appreciate the Tao Te Ching for the writing and significance. This subtle philosophy can be difficult to comprehend, but reading the text and performing your own analysis before delving into interpretations is a good beginning.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in the Tao Te Ching; it is a beautiful introduction, and can become a family treasure."
4,A walk in the park,"Yet another game by Ocean Software, this game if you don't know is a tie-in with the movie. The game is a typical side-scroller shoot-em-up. Unlike other Ocean releases, this game actually manages to get it right. The game effectively captures the exciting elements of the movie and the graphics are great for the monochrome gameboy. The sound is good and gameplay is great. This game is great from the start itself and along the game, you get to lock horns with the likes of the pterodactyl, the triceratops, the raptor and the ferocious T-Rex himself. The levels are intuitive. This is definately a game you shouldn't miss out on though the gameplay is short with about six or seven levels in total which can be finished in around 4-5 hours max if you are average gamer that is. All I can say is try it and buy it.OVERALLGRAPHICS-4/5SOUND-4/5GAMEPLAY-5/5"
4,A lost treasure,"This is one of the most unique Judo books I've ever read. It includes a pretty decent history of judo, incuding a section focusing specifically on women's judo, and demonstrates everything from fastening the belt to katas vs. swords! I have to say that while 40 throws were demonstrated, there wasn't much detail. On the other hand, the direction of happo-kuzushi (off-ballancing) was given for every throw. Also shown were warm-ups, combination throws, body movements (called tai-sabaki), a variety of hold-downs, locks and chokes (including a leg lock!), and self-defense against common grabs, strikes, and knife/sword attacks. Also included are counters to some of the common judo groundfighting techniques, as kata. I'd recomend this to anyone doing gi-based grappling, but there is also some good tradition stuff in here, as well as some unique self-defense movements, probably most useful to a judoka who wants to know how to apply what he's learned."
3,a difficult game,"For the first time player, battletoads seems like a ""ninja turtles beat em up"" game but anyone who plays this will soon find that it is rather different. There are two reasons why I give this game a 3 out of 5 star rating: #1- Even though Battletoads is challenging to begin with, some parts of the game are just flat annoying! #2- The last level is nearly impossible to beat. Overall most people will enjoy Battletoads except for those who hate any kind of challenging games."
5,just as great as the first one,"The cage2 is just as great as the first cage album,Martin's voice is beatiful again,specially in ""wind of change"". Another good thing in this album is the addition of bass player Tony Franklin who plays very good under Dario Mollo's riffs.It's a great CD as good as sabbath's TYR or Cross Purposes."
4,Buy it!,"If you like hard rock and good singers, I bet you've heard of Tony Martin (ex Black Sabbath). This record is very good most of the part. There are at least a couple of tracks that have the potental to be classics (at least if another band, like Sabbath, would have released them) - ""overload"", ""guardian angel"", ""balance of power"", ""amore silenzioso"", and ""theater of dreams""."
2,"A couple of strong songs but one is a cover, mostly boring","The leadoff track has some energy and ""Overload"" isn't a bad song, just sets the tempo for the majority of the album. The cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Dazed and Confused"" is very good, not really straying from the original, just beefing it up in the production department. The rest is just boring. Mollo does a better job with Glenn Hughes in Voodoo Hill."
1,Very disappointed,"I recently purchased 5 cases of Wellness cat food and the cans arrived at my home in their securely wrapped cases all dented up. One of my cats is turning her nose up at this food - she pigged-out on this food when I brought it home from the local pet food store. These cans, if they were sitting on a store shelf, would not be purchased and I feel that National Pet Pharmacy is taking advantage of online orders to get rid of canned food that would otherwise not sell."
5,Wellness canned food has been a lifesaver for our cat!,"Our cat, Isabel, has struggled with UTI and weight issues for years. After our vet recommended a wet food only diet, we experimented with a variety of brands (included Rx), but could never find a wet food that made Isabel feel full, and not spend the rest of the day begging us for more food.Then we tried Wellness canned food.Isabel loves it (but she loves anything that resembles food, so that's not a huge hurdle), but what is great about Wellness is it fills her up! And not only has she stopped constantly begging for food, she started to lose weight! Her dandruff is going away, she is no longer lethargic and has started to play again, and she generally seems like a happier cat.Now that her chronic UTI has finally cleared up, we give her mostly Wellness canned food with a little bit of dry food mixed in. This is still her primary source of food, and she is just as happy now as when we first made the switch."
5,Great product,"This is a great product and comes up high on many lists of good choices to feed your cats. It is pricey but I feel it is worth it as the ingredients are so good. The food is good smelling and my cats love it. I am amazed at how much litter box odors have been reduced since switching to this food. Also, the large cans are a great way to save money. Per ounce the price is considerably lower. It is very easy to just plop the leftover food into a container and put it in the fridge. I also often keep a portion out in a sealed container on the counter, for a second meal later in the day. The cats prefer the food at room-temp. Leftover food can also be microwaved on a low setting with no problems. Love getting this food delivered to my door for a good price."
5,My cat's favorite!,A bit pricey but worth it. My 8 months old cat was crazy about it and his fur was shiny like never before! Wish Amazon can broker a better price for auto ship. I would be singed up for life.
5,Great food for kittens,My kittens love this food. It has all natural ingredients and it is the right quantity as well. The main component of the food is meat and is free of any grains. A great purchase for your cats.
1,Grossly overpriced for **tiny** cans,"I was in a hurry that day and unfortunately I assumed that based on the price ($31 for 24 cans) that this would be the normal size cans (5.5 oz). That price is nearly as much as you'd pay for a case of the regular cans just about anywhere. Well, these are the teeny tiny cans - about one serving for just one of my cats. At $1.25 a pop, I can't afford to feed my cat using this reseller. This price is extremely high for these cans. Go to your local pet store if you want a reasonable price. Cat food is supposed to be cheaper by the case, not more expensive."
2,"I want to love this stuff, as the ingredients are great, but: diarrhea.","Pretty sure this stuff is giving all six of my foster kittens diarrhea, which neither their dry kibble (Blue Buffalo Wilderness Kitten) nor their alternative wet food (Fancy Feast Classic grain-free varieties) do. I don't think they absorb much in the way of nutrition when the food shoots right through them, and of course it's a messy experience for me. Not a fan of this product."
3,Has some unfortunate elements,Thought this was a great and pure brand but now find out this is not so.Have switched to Halo products.
4,The only cat food my cat eats and loves,My picky eater cat is getting older and rejects plenty of other cat foods. She loves this one and has less shedding because of the ingredients in this food.
2,Not for my kittens,My 6 month old kittens won't touch Wellness Kitten canned food. I'm sure it's good for them but I can't get them to eat it. I've tried on 2 separate occasions without any success. One of my kittens is very finicky but the other one eats almost anything so I've given up on this brand.
4,Terrible Delivery from Amazon,"We usually order this from Petco because our cat has health problems and can only eat specific types of cat food. Ordering online at Amazon is easier and cheaper. But This time I noticed that this item, ordered FROM Amazon, was being promoted as a 2 day shipping item, despite having Prime Membership, and I needed it as soon as possible. After about a week of ordering this '2 day shipping item' i received notification that it had not yet shipped and was expected to be delivered a month later! The reasoning I was given was that if I order from Amazon.com directly I should expect a month wait time and they were out of stock. 1-I received no notification that the item was out of stock. 2-Don't promote something as a special with 2 day shipping when you don't mean it. People order things based on delivery time for a reason. I'm angry that I wasted my time and was relying for the food to get here in a timely manner. I will not order directly from Amazon again."
5,Healthy Kitten Food,"I purchased this food on the recommendations of cat nutrition experts in the know. I read about Wellness foods online as being an excellent food for cats.My kitten really enjoys this food. It is his favorite canned variety of several that I rotate feeding him. I only wish the Wellness came in larger cans and offered more varieties just for kittens.I sure hope it's as good as claimed...I want to give my beautiful kitten the best possible diet but it is hard to know what is really lurking in those cans.That is why I only buy what is considered high-quality, premium foods for him. He eats a mixture of canned and frozen raw from Nature's Variety.(The raw medallions are his favorite of everything I feed him! ) I will continue to feed him Wellness canned food as he matures."
3,Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.,"We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.Update 5-27-10: As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience."
1,Our cats no longer will touch any of it.,"We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food. Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats. MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore. They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it. Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal. We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat. It's ridiculous. It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned. Same thing. We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat."
3,good brand BUT,have trusted this brand for my cats and dogs for a long timebut dog is very picky and decided she does not like this
3,She eats it but it's like pulling teeth,"I was disappointed to have spent the money and then find that my cat does not really like this food. She will eat it if she's starving and even then I have to sit near and coax her. She loves Fancy Feast and I only feed her the non-seafood ones and the ones that do not contain wheat gluten (both cause allergic reactions in her) so that narrows her diet down to the FF classic turkey, chicken, and beef. I hoped to add some variety with this Wellness and hoped to get away from buying cat food with by-products in it but Wellness chicken is not the answer. It's too thick and sticky. Too bad for me because it smells WAY better than the Fancy Feast."
3,Wellness Review Turkey/Salmon,"We've been purchasing direct from retail stores, either PetSmart or Felix & Oscar's in Springfield, VA. The condition of the cans shipped was not as good as I would have hoped. Several cans were dented in each shipment. Quality of the cat food is very good; cost savings may outweigh the shipping issues and the convenience of not going to the pet store."
3,Not either great or nasty.,"Has no pieces of vegetables or fresh meat, rather just a greying animal paste that looks like Whiskas food. I guess that's why is cheaper."
5,Healthy and tasty cat food,"Wellness is the only canned food I buy for my cats. I has no by products, preservatives or any artificial junk. No grain, and it's first four ingredients are good meats. My cats love it (even the finicky one) and I'm happy there is at least one cat food company out there that provides nutritious pet food. Thank you Wellness! Buying this is chaper than buying in the store as well, I think if you buy the same amount in the store you pay about 13 dollars more. Just be aware of the fact that you need a can opener to open these cans."
2,difficult to review for a cat but...,"The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ... but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product."
3,She must be a picky eater.,"My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats..."
3,Loved the first three cans...,"After feeding my recently-acquired cat a case of Wellness Turkey and Salmon without issue, I fully expected her to love the Beef and Salmon as much. Unfortunately, she loved only the first three cans and won't touch it now without adding some dry food to it. Hopefully, she will still eat the Turkey and Salmon without any problems."
3,"Great, but mind the smell","My cat loves this food, but this particular flavor, beef and salmon, is a bit strong when it comes to the smell. I had to wash my hands more than once to get the smell entirely off. Now the problem is that my cat reeks of fish, she smells like a walking tuna sandwich. If you're okay with that, by all means get it, but I'm going to avoid this one in the future because I can't stand her smelling like this all the time."
1,wellness canned cat food,"We bought a case of this cat food and our cats liked it and seemed to do well. After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it. Thought it might have been a bad can so we tossed what was left. Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days. We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally. I don't know if this was just a bad case of food or if Wellness has a quality control problem, but I would hesitate to purchase another product from Wellness."
3,My cats don't like it,"If my cats could leave reviews they would probably give this product a 1 star. Fortunately they can't, so I'm giving it a 3 stars for effort :) I realize that different cats used to different foods, however mine for some reason would rather starve than eat turkey formula cat food from Wellness. Otherwise I trust Wellness brand, they seem to put good ingredients, and no grains.Also there was no mentioning anywhere about quantity. It comes in 12 large cans.Before getting it tho, I suggest you go to local Petco and get a smaller can of same Turkey formula and check if your cats will eat it."
5,"Great, natural product","Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love. I chose this brand for its natural ingredients. Two of my cats have issues - one with diabetes and one with obesity. I needed a cat food that is grain free (for the fat kitty) and low carb (for the diabetic kitty). If you need a cat food that is not loaded with byproduct garbage, then Wellness is a great choice."
3,None of our cats would touch it,"We have been transitioning our 4 cats over from the crap Purina makes to Wellness, and for most of the flavors, they love it. They like it much better than Friskies. Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders."
5,Crack for Cats,"I started feeding my over-weight cat Wellness canned and stopped all other foods including any dry. No more vomiting, no more shedding like crazy, no more begging for food all day long and waking me up in the night. She's lost a little bit (not much), but she looks great and I have not stepped in a pile of vomit in months.Love this food!!"
1,The recipe or ingredient quality has changed (?),"I am on the board of an animal shelter, and have 23 cats of my own. We were directed to Wellness as an excellent no-grain food. We buy the largest sized cans, and we spend almost $800 per month on this food. The cats used to love all of the flavors we bought (Turkey, Chx, Chx and Beef, Turkey and Salmon) and suddenly NONE of them will eat ANY of them! I can only surmise that something has happened to the recipe, or the quality of the ingredients. It makes no sense. More bizarre, we feed the outdoor (feral) cats the food and many of them won't touch it, either. The hunt is on to find the next ""great food""..."
1,"Great food, but...","...lousy packaging/storage. While the food itself is wonderful and the cat loves it, Amazon really made a mess of my order. When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid. We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it. I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can. It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands. Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon. Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible."
1,Wellness Kitten Brand Recall Turned me off from this product,Wellness kitten brand cat food has been recalled twice. It made my kitty sick both times and we had no idea it was the cat food. I will never buy this product again. The company did a poor job communicating the recall to its customers. Our cat's thiamine level was affected.
1,Wellness changed distribution methods??...Unsafe product???,"After purchasing Wellness Chicken cat food for almost a year, my cats refuse to eat it. The one that did, vomited it back up. I switched to the Turkey formula but same thing. Not one will eat it. I called Wellned and they say they changed the way they distribute their cat food but that makes no sense. I am concerned about the health of my cats if I continue to feed Wellness so I am switching to a different type of cat food."
4,Best for my picky cat,"I feed my elderly cat Wellness canned and dry. She only gets the beef and chicken or just chicken canned food. Fish flavors are out of the question with her seizure disorder. Her last vet checkup went very well, even with her kidney issues. I would recommend Wellness to anybody looking for a better cat food option. Doesn't do well with cats that have digestive problems. My younger cat can't eat Wellness without getting foul gas and diarrhea."
4,Cat Food,My cats eat it that is all I can say. I try and buy the best food available but we cat owners can only say our cats eat it or will not eat it. What my cats really like is just tuna you by at the grocery store but I use this only for a treat. They eat hard food primarily and I use the more expensive brand.
2,Don't be fooled - it's a reprint from his other book/s,"Rick Beech has only published one book, but it has come out in numerous formats. ""Action Origami"" is an extract of the larger version of his book published as ""Origami Handbook"" and ""Origami: The Complete Guide to the Art of Paperfolding."" Weirdly, all of the different books can sometimes be found in bookshops together, the only difference between the full versions being the covers and the wildly different price tags.Give this smaller one a miss, and try to pick up ""Origami Handbook"" - it's the cheapest version thus far. :-("
4,Enjoying the quartets and quintets,"Just getting to know these pieces, so I can't compare to anyone else. But it is great music and well executed."
1,What a SCAM! Do NOT buy this!,"This is the worst DVD that is on the market. It is marketed to take advantage of people who are trying to learn more about Bipolar disorder. It conveys no clinical information and does not show the subject in states of mania. It conveys no information about the treatments, symptoms, or prognosis for patients of bipolar disorder. Do not buy this DVD, opt for one of the ""Trouble in Mind"" series. Completely worthless. No clinical value whatsoever. (...)"
3,Clark black wallabee,"Consider getting one full size smaller. I usually wear a 12, and the 11.5 is still too big. They do look cool though."
5,what a treat,"This evening I went into Amoeba San Francisco with the idea of buying something by Merikanto, the 20th-century Finnish composer. Well, there are two Merikantos, father and son, and by mistake I got the father's music instead. Very good fortune indeed. The elder Merikanto is contemporary with Sibelius and created the kind of music that Sibelius himself wanted to write. The two of them, it seems to me, are Finland's answer to Bartok and Kodaly: Sibelius, like Bartok, the more rigorously classical, with the elder Merikanto, like Kodaly, more ""popular"" and accessible, though by no means a composer of ""light"" music. Everything on this disc is immediately gripping and intensely listenable. Much of it is vocal, so it's a great help that the booklet gives side-by-side Finnish-English texts. Other selections are piano and chamber pieces. All of it is handsomely done, and you won't wonder Sibelius wanted to write music like this."
1,Look at the price,"When your lamp starts to burn low sure you may need a new generator.But think about the price. You can much better go to the coleman site and order the part there. I know Amazon does not want us to comment on pricing here, but what is being charged here is just plain ridiculous.Shame on you, Amazon, for even having this on your site!"
4,"DNA, RNA, enzymes","A good detailed treatment of DNA, RNA, and enzymes. My only complaint is that these topics are not well linked to more general cellular biology."
5,Intoxicating,"For the record, the image Amazon has on display (at least as I write this) of this 2-CD set is not of the Harmonia Mundi ""1+1"" set that Amazon is selling. Sonatas 1-6 and 6-12 were initially released on separate CDs by Harmonia Mundi in the early 90's, and the ""1+1"" release brings all 12 sonatas together in a single set. (An image of the cover of the set Amazon is selling can be found in Andrew Manze's discography at the Harmonia Mundi website.)I love Manze whether he's playing Vivaldi, Handel, Bach, Biber, Corelli, etc. I find his playing intoxicating, delicious and moving, and his performance of Vivaldi's Manchester Sonatas is no exception."
1,"Great Saw, terrible motor and support","I have owned this saw for several years. I am not a full time woodworker so I do not use the saw frequently.Recently while ripping some 3/4"" oak the saw sputtered, lights dimmed and the breaker kicked out accompanied by the terrible smell of a failed motor.I have the 5hp model, and have never run anything through the saw that even slowed it down. This motor should last a lifetime!The tech support staff was good but upon coming to the conclusion there was likely a dead short in the windings I was informed that he could not help since warranty was expired and to call customer service and I could buy a new motor ...OVER $600.00! (I could save some if I bought through a distributor).When I buy tools I try to buy quality that will last, If you do too, do not buy Jet!"
3,Its not bad,"I am happy with this player, in general. I think the sound is great. The anti skip protection is also great. I wear the player on my belt using the belt clip while I jog and it hasn't skip once yet. By the way, the belt clip is a fantastic thing to have. I hate the fact that not a lot of portable players have this feature. For me sound and good anti-skip protection are the determing factors in getting a player (as well as a belt clip).However I have some of the same complains as a previous reviewer.This player could afford a redesign. As is, the volume button is definitely too close to the open/close button. I keep opening the player when all I want to do is adjust the volume. This problem got to be so aggravating that I put a rubber band around the player. On my player it takes between 9 to 30 seconds before the player starts to play MP3s, depending curiously enough on which burning program I use to burn the disc. The resume feature is useless with mp3s."
2,what IS this???,"I did not enjoy this game at all. my couisin works at a game developement studio and let me give this game a go. i started playing it and the plot was nothing at all original. a mystical ninja bursts into town and stirs everything up,basic platform game with no original battle engine and the dialogue is for little kids. not something anyone would buy because the game is just too frusterating and is NO fun at all."
2,I'd return it if I didn't get it dirt cheap...,"What I paid for this is all that it's worth. The page layout is hardly inspiring and i would hesitate to call this write/author a graphic designer or artist. For those of you who prefer Mac visuals and OSX screenshots, this ain't for you. Nothing but Windoze. I would recommend ""Exploring Illustrator CS"" by Annesa Hartman instead, a very much more complete training manual."
3,Pretty boring Don't spend the money.,If this game was free then it's worth playing but I wouldn't spend 15 or so bucks for it.
3,ASIN: B00005NGHN - Not the Wong Ka Wai film soundtrack,"ASIN: B00005NGHN - Google item number and you will see that this CD is for a 3 CD set not the same as the Wong Ka Wai film soundtrack for ""In The Mood For Love"". The item number is for a CD as shown on the above illustration. Apparently there is a error listing the wrong ""sample music"". I was unable to contact the seller - However - Buyer Beware!"
2,could be better,Basically in this game the object is to complete a phrase (an apple a day...keeps the doctor away). I never actually played a full game how you are suppose to. Its kind of slow. The phrases are either way to easy or something I have never heard of. My husband and I read the cards aloud while on a road trip last year. We drove for about six hours and all the cards in the box were not enough to last until we reached our destination. The best part of the game (how we played in the car) was making up crazy answers to the segments we were completely clueless on.
2,average Club Cut,"the video is cool,but the song just seems like a Desperate attempt at keeping a Radio friendly song by Kayne West.also not a smart move by Jamie Foxx who while it was a Great Performance in the Movie Ray based on the Life of Ray charles,doing a take on ""I Got a Woman"" on this Song ain't exactly a smart move at making your own Musical Idenity as a Solo Artist.""Gold Digger""is a long ago played term,but it seems to work."
4,Gold Digger just got a whole lot BIGGER!,"I thought I would be offended by this song but I actually really liked it! I loved the cheeky off the wall video with the magazine backgrounds and the pretty girls strutting their stuff along with two good looking dudes who want to show the world that they know what they are talking about.I loved the lyrics as well, totally tongue in cheek and Kanye West sure knows how to belt out a rap come song and Jaime FOXX gave it his all along with the many pretty dancers who sure knew how to flaunt their stuff!This is a naughty and sometimes rude song but you can't say it is not fun, because it is, and it gets a solid four out of five from me based on this alone."
5,A Must-have for Less-than-Perfect Days,"This book is just ""frickin"" hilarious! Right from when you first turn the cover page over to the very end. Stefan is a brilliant writer; he makes high school life sound like a war - and there are always his sarcastic remarks that will never fail to make you LOL - laugh out loud!"
5,Handy item for adapting MP3 player to stereo out for sound system,"Hooking in an MP3 player to a stereo system is great with this little Item. you can use the standard sound cables and keep this item with the MP3 player. Hooks right into the standard headphone adapter of many players, or even the auxillary of others. There are actual sets of sound cables 6 foor to mini plug available as well, i just like this kind of item since its smaller to carry with and most of my friends have standard sound cables if we want to hook this up to their systems."
3,Hmmmm..Good,"Bought this as a small gift for my Daughter in law. She vacationed up north last summer and found a new favorite jam.Can't find huckleberries anywhere around us in Oklahoma. Only problem, I expected a greater amount. Small sizes don't follow with the proces paid.Jamey11"
1,Cheesy cutting room catastrophes,"A wretched collection of poor acting, bad set design and miserable direction, some of these mutations actually rise to some semblance of artfulness. Don't think for an instant that these even merit the Mystery Science Theatre treatment: they don't. They ended up on these bargain discs only because the licensing was a give away, and no one made the slightest effort to clean up the transfers. So don't be surprised if the Technicolor is black and white, or some color blind intermediate form. I have looked at the discs once so far, with the high point being the old Saturday morning cliff hanger bits. There are better copies on Amazon, which I would encourage you to purchase, should the desire emplore you to do so."
3,Nice game.... Too short.,"This game had a lot going for it. The nice music and graphics, even sound bytes! But then they put in the never-ending second level and made the game end in the third level. *Sigh* Good play control too."
2,Short but sweet,The game is extremely short only haveing 3 levels. The second level will take you a while but the game can be beaten within 15 minutes. The gameplay is ok and the graphics are average being is old as it is. If your a huge Ren And Stimpy fan you might want to by this title at a cheap price otherwise forget it.
5,Haunting and Poignant !,"This book is an honest and realistic look at how difficult life was for Midwesterns living in the early 1900's. Otto Ping was one of the first people in Southern Indiana to own a camera. My father and grandfather have always described ""Uncle Ott"" as fun loving and adventurous. Otto Ping had absolutely no idea how his new toy would end up leaving his legacy. The book will leave the reader with images of the past you will never be able to forget.Lisa(Ping)ArvizuGreat Niece to Otto Ping"
3,Bargain Buy,You can't go wrong with this baby! It won't eat out your pocket and you will be glad you didn't go all out for the expensive stuff when you can have all the functionality for a lower price!! It's simple and reliable. Put your money to good use. That's my bid. Cheers.
2,Beware of this machine...read on,"Because this machine uses a microcassette, when it picks up a call, it will make plenty of noise to rewind and set the tape etc..If I am sleeping, this machine has never failed to wake me up everytime with its loud analog gears.. even if I have the volume down all the way, even if I am in a different room and I have a door closed . Also if you turn the machine off, it is programmed to pick up the call after 15 rings. I thought nobody would ring me 15 times, but I was wrong. People did that and it woke me up every single time.If this machine won't interfere with your sleeeping, it might be a good buy. The sound is very good on it (better than the digital machines). Functionally it is fine."
1,Don't waste your money - take a bucket with you.,"IMHO, a total waste of money. A jug and bucket would do better. No where to drain and hold dirty water. Sink fills from gravity in drain area. Totally Useless!"
3,Solution to how to open the Portable Sink,"I like gadgets. This is a good gadget for a family with a tent, or for a family that picnics. When filled with water, though, this is heavy. You wouldn't hike anywhere with this. When tenting, I didn't want to wash my hands under the water spigot at the tent site. My feet got wet and sometimes muddy. That's why I got this sink. This sink is an outdoor sink. It drains right out of the bottom onto the picnic table. To solve the problem with opening the sink without pulling the top and bottom apart: the best way to open the sink is to turn it around so that the hinge is against your belly and open it. The top and bottom will stay together. Another issue is that the holes for the toothbrushes are small. Nowadays toothbrushes are so ergonomical and thick. You might have to stay aware about which toothbrush to buy and bring with you."
4,Totally happy,"I was ready for a new TV for my rec room and didn't want to by an analog set that would be outdated in a few years. The Samsung was by far the best deal for the money. The picture is fabuous, particuarly with DVD's. I can't wait till the price of the digital tuners comes down a bit. I'm really looking forward to using this for HDTV broadcasts!"
5,It's simply the best!!!,"I think is the best purchase I did (...)! (along with Tae-Bo) I just love the way they explain how to define your brows, but if you never did this it would be much easier with the help of this book! Just be prepare to stand out!!"
2,Black & White Bore,Call me childish but I need pictures! Color pictures even better! If you are a visual person I do not recommend this book. There is about 20 pages of text before you get to an actual illustration. Perhaps it should have never been a paperback. Beauty books are best in hardcover...and in color!
5,Brow Wow!,"This is a purse sized book jam packed with information about eyebrows! The eyebrows frame and ""set off"" your face. This book teaches you simple steps to help you choose a brow shape that suits your facial shape ie square, oval, round etc. and facial features ie nose shape, distance between the eyes etc. The writers explain different methods to remove unwanted eyebrow hair, and how to shape the brows into the desired style. Each part of the anatomy of the brow is explained and details on how to shape it properly are covered. I had never thought about the shape of the inner part of my brow that is near my nose for example. But the authors cover different effects you will achieve by shaping this in different ways. The book also includes a few celebrity pictures and their brows and explains how to achieve the look. The book is written in a friendly, easy to read manner - entertains as it educates. A good buy!"
5,A great beauty investment,"A friend gave me this book because she knows I pay a fortune to have my brows waxed at a salon once a month. The brow lady there had me terrified to use tweezers myself, so I kept on coming back to her. Well, no longer! This book holds all her secrets and more. The instructions are super easy to follow. Now, I do what the pro at the salon did in just a few minutes in the privacy of my own bathroom and my brows look just as good, even better because I don't have to put up with any stubble in between appointments. And I figure that I've saved mega-bucks (of course, I spent it all on shoes, but that's another story)."
2,A Bit Odd...,"Have had this book a while and each time I revisit it, it doesn't get any better. GOD gave us the shape of our eyebrows for a reason, so we don't look like circus clowns! According to the theory of this book--after recommendations are made for which brow goes best with which face shape--ANY woman can wear ANY shape brow, regardless of thickness, shape and length. Not so. Well, any woman can, but she can fully expect to look ridiculous with some shapes/styles. Brows are NOT one-sz-fits-all, unfortunately."
5,Great for everyone!,"This is a little paperback book, but very handy and great eyebrow tips and even hair tips. I loved it and would recommend to those of you who work in the beauty industry. It had basic face shape and all that stuff and even assist you in measuring to truly fine out which face shape you really are rather than thinking maybe maybe maybe. It helps with issues such as making your brows lighter or darker depending on face shape to enhance your look. It assist you with which brow shape is right for you etc. It is easy to read and its helped me greatly! would recommend!"
5,"Wonderful, Insightful little book!","I'm delighted with this little book. I finished the book in about 3 hours - including a deep decent into nerd-dom with my trusty ruler. Some tidbits I didn't even know:- I thought I had an oval face - nope it is more of a heart.- I had no ideas about using brows to balance my features.- I thought but wasn't sure about my best brow type and have experimented lots with it. Again, intuition confirmed, my face with its shape and dominant features does best with a relatively high arched, rounded, fuller brow.I definitely recommend this book for any woman not satisfied with her brows and those not familiar with face shapes / balancing features."
5,Eyebrows,"Book says eyebrows, but talks about so much more... Glad to learn on how to improve my looks with the know how of experts!Great company.. Will use them again!Thanks everyone!"
4,Guideline for eyebrow & face shapes,"I was in a state-approved class for esthetics and we were learning how to wax eyebrows. I bought this book to help me learn how to properly wax eyebrows. Even though the focus is on how to TWEEZE eyebrows, I'm still happy I bought it. It goes step-by-step on how to figure out the proper shape/length/height of anyone's eyebrows. It's a good buy for the price. I recommend it."
5,No more brow anxiety!,"I love this book! Before I read it, I was definitely brow-challenged, and worried about making a horrible mistake. But it clearly explained how to find the right shape for my face and then use a little tweezing to get it. The authors also recommend using brow powder instead of pencil to fill in the bald spots (I had some from previous bad plucking experiences). Pure genius! The brow powder has made an incredible difference. The result is so much more natural looking, not harsh or painted on. Now, grooming my brows is as routine as putting on my lipstick. This book makes it really easy. I'm recommending it to all my friends."
4,Cute book!,"This is a nice book, a bit hard to understand, but overall it gets the job done. It helps you choose the right brow for the right face shape and helps you with tips to trimming and so much more. For the price this book beats not knowing what your doing, saves you a lot of time and hassel figuring out what to do with your brows. Good book."
2,"Very dated, lack of photos, little insight","This book focuses on the 50's era celebrity eyebrow. I expected it to teach me how to create a natural-looking beautiful and groomed brow. Instead, it promotes a very painted-on, harsh and artificical eyebrow. Unless you usually wear heavy makeup, these eyebrows will simply seem out of place on your face.Another problem I had with this book is it's surprising lack of pictures. There are only four or so human models used in the book. Their grainy b&w before and after photos are obviously doctored by thick pancake makeup to cover their natural brows and unnaturally dark eyepencil is used to draw them back on. The after effects of their ""new"" eyebrows aren't even flattering!If you are looking for a guide for very dramatic eyebrows for a costume or nightclub look, you might appreciate this book, but if you want a guide for natural-looking, beautiful eyebrows that blend with the rest of your face instead of redefining it, you'd best spend your money elsewhere."
5,THIS IS DEFINELY S-M-O-K-E-Y!!,"This album is great. The style is still ""Smokey"" - the music is both classic and modern. Smokey still is SMOKIN'!!!!"
5,Review of Intimate,The product was received in great shape and I am enjoying the CD immenisely. My experience has been terrific. I will utilize the service again for sure.
2,the voice is there but the music?,the voice of this legend and his genius past writings should be required listening for new jacks&jills period.but this disc won't do him any justice.the first cut sounds to much like maxwell not to mention that much of this material seems dated.the voice of this genius deserves better treatment.he is way better than the material here.
2,"""Sleepin' In"" Evokes Maxwell's ""Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder","Track 1 is derivative of Maxwell's first hit; Maxwell was never accused of being derivative-he reinvented the format that Smokey and Marvin created, and does it better now than Smokey. Why does Smokey have to ape Maxwell? If he was the first, what is wrong??"
2,Loses its flavor fast,"Paperboy has the same original outlook as the original game, but it grows old quickly, and has very little variation."
1,Disappointing,"I have just received this DVD from Amazon. ""Camille"" is not even on this dvd. I am very disappointed with this. The only reason I bought this DVD is for Colin Firth and Camille. The word ""Camille"" is written on one of the DVDs but it does not contain the movie. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Linda"
2,I was disappointed,"The quality of the image is not great and this is a huge minus for me !Some of the movies in that collection are not exactly ""favorites"" but this is just my taste ...."
1,Romantic comedies without Colin Firth - a dvd cheat!,"I bought this in 2008, and it didn't have the important words, Colin Firth and Camille. I wrote and complained and they sent me the same dvd again (can they waste money like this?). Now, I see that they are still advertising the dvds with Colin Firth's name on it. In the UK, we could take them to court for getting our money under false pretences! DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT COLIN FIRTH TO BE ON IT - HE'S NOT!!"
2,"It's a ""good thing"" if you have the time and skill.","This book is a complilation of the ""good things"" column from Martha Stewart Living, 1990-1996. A few of the ideas, a customized sewing kit, decanting liquid dish soap from a bottle, slicing onions near a flame to keep from crying, tossing shellfish with corn meal to get rid of excess sand, keeping appliance warranties in an accordian file, preaparing a fruit butter with only a few ingredients, and using tea towels as simple window treatments, are easily accomplished by just about anyone.Yet, some of these ideas require being rooted in a skill that requires good hand and eye coordination. A nice knick knack shelf needs dedicated carpentry skills. An attractive table mat needs basic sewing skills and a sewing machine. Napkins become lovely unique after several minutes of hand embroidery.Look at this book at a library before committing to buying it."
5,I never read a book this perfect,"The idea was brilliant, the crafts are pretty easy to make. I especially love the idea about how to make a votive inside an apple. If you love to entertain and enjoy to make a good things..then I recommend this book for you."
4,My wife loves it!!,My wife recently became interested in crafts and home decor. The Best of Martha Stewart captures her interests in both areas very well. The book makes her feel like a litte girl!!
1,Nothing Good Here But Try....,"...these others books that I think are grand:The New Decorating Book (Better Homes and Gardens(R))by Better Homes and Gardens, Elegant and Easy Rooms: 250 Trade Secrets for Decorating Your Home, Elegant and Easy Living Rooms: 100 Trade Secrets for Designing With Style (Elegant and Easy).I used all three with my designer and the results were delightful. Martha is just so passe anymore."
1,to be used only with USB cable,"It's not a wall mount charger. You've to use by connecting through regular charged to this. The seller charged me $4.99 for shipping. But sent the item by first class USPS, costing only $1.14. Charged me excess of $3.85."
2,Not what I hoped,When I got this Game I was hoping that it would be alittle more like the movie. There is only 5 levels and all you have to do is free these little green creatures. Its really easy and I suggest it 4 a beginer gamer.
3,small and expensive,"I guess I just didn't know the size but this was way smaller than I was expecting, maybe only 2 inches long. I was expecting it to be much bigger. It seems well made and looks like the picture. I can't speak to the fishing results since I was going for bigger stuff."
5,The new Breed II,The greatest book for developing your four limb independance and improvisational skills.This is a useful and challenging book for players of all skill levels.Gary Chester is the master of drum education and he has taught drummers such as Kenny Aronoff and Dave Weckl.This book is a must read for any drummer that has professional aspirations.
5,Why aren't these guys famous?,"I'll admit to a bias on this one -- the bassist in Kid Million is my brother-in-law -- but even if that weren't true, I'd say that ""Heaven Smiles"" is a rocking CD that deserves a much wider audience than it has. David Singer's voice is alternative-outstanding,and I can guarantee that you're going to enjoy this album even if the lyrics do say things like ""I hate you when you're beautiful, I die when you're succeed."""
2,this product does not include USB interface,"Hi,I am so surprise to find that this product does not include USB interface as its specification describe.Only provide a parellel interface.As far I can not find a suitable interface for my laptop. I think it is better that Amazon provide an option to customer to select, or clearly tell customer the default config of the interface.Anyway,my printer can not be used now."
2,Not all that good,"I got a chance to play this a few years back, and to be honest, I didnt like it. I felt the gameplay to be VERY SLUGGISH, and just outright boring.I am not a HUGE fan of the Castlevania series, but I did LOVE SOTN. I thought that was a GREAT PS1 game. I felt Legends to be very shallow in most parts, but the game was not all that bad. I just wish that the programmers could of spent more time making the gameplay more exciting, but instead they didnt. Get this game if you are a fan of the series, but if you are not, then dont bother wastening your 20 bucks."
2,Where did they go wrong?,"You play as a chick. Okay, that's the absolute best part of the game. And if playing as chicks isn't your thing, then this game has no redeeming qualities. The play-control is rather sluggish and the jumping, though more controllable, is too short. The game just seems too shallow. I hope Sonia returns in a game that can do her justice, after all, she IS the very first Belmont (according to Konami) generation-wise. ... or at least she was before she was declared non-canon. At least the music is good ... sort of. I mean it's not terrible. It's kind of catchy and does not make me want to rip my eardrums out ... or turn the volume off which would probably be a much better idea.After doing some research, I can tell you that Sonia Belmont will almost definitely not make a return ever or at least as long as IGA is in charge. She's been stripped from the official time line."
5,Very useful for large hard drives.,Very easy to install. Well-made and seems to run quietly. Should add to lifetime of today's very large drives that can run very hot.
2,eh,Said it was for the complete seasons 1-7 but only sent season one. When I emailed to confront on this issue was told it was a a mistake. Wasn't happy about it.
1,Hmm not so good,"This game is not the best game I've played.first off, the characters move sooo slow. Secondly the backround music is annoying. Thirdly it was easy to beat (for an amateur gamer as myself). The plot is kind of bland might I add.If you are to get a game, then I don't recommend this one. Or hey even better -- buy a book instead, it's better for you to read."
1,Nothing but trouble!,"This computer crashed right out of the box. HP customer service is horrible. Nothing but broken promises. I've been fighting this for months. It been diagnosed with a bad motherboard by an HP service center out of the country, but they could not fix it. International warranty is joke because they make models for each country than can only be serviced in that country. Laptop will only function if I disable the wireless. The audio and video ports will not function. Video driver crashes Windows, as does wireless driver. The CD drive will not recognize a blank CD, and only works sometimes if I bypass Windows and use another burning program. HP keeps breaking promises about when I will recieve a functioning computer. The phone number to the 'Caseworker Hotline' cannot take messages to call back because the mailbox is full. This comppany has the worst customer service I have every encounted. I will never buy HP again."
4,Awesome Laptop!!,"I buy this notebook to change my old HP dv6005us.I was facinated with the new design and performance of the machine.I was mainly looking for a notebook where I could work and play, and this one fills all my expectations.The graphics capacity are really cool. It says that the memory is shared, but, with 2gb of ram, a little of that memory dedicated to video, doesn't hurt anyone.The Speed of the hdd is very cool, that is because its a SATA drive.PROS:-RAM memory: 2 gb!!!-Nvidia Graphics-120 GB HDD SATA-Webcam-Remote Control-Lightscribe DVD burner-Really light weigth, for the size of the computer.-Really cool design in the black cover.CONS:-Low batery life (about 1.2 to 1.6 hours , depending on usage). But I have understanded that this is due to the amount of ram,in other words, more ram, more battery spent.-It gets a little hot around the touchpad area.-Operating system doesn't came in discs, I had to burn it from the computer..."
1,I cut this film off my must-have list of movies. Zero start out of 5,"The acting, dialogue and special effect are exactly like those of TV shows. They're dull and pretentious. There's no excitement, and suspense at all. For example, the opening scene showed a hostage girl killed by her kidnapper but I did not felt touched at all. I got no emotion or entertaining from watching this DVD.I prefer Chuck Norris in Delta Force 2 and the movie in which he fought with Bruce Lee. (I forget its title). They're full of action and look very real."
1,Disappearing video,"The dvd arrived on time. The first 5 or 10 minutes of the dvd was excellent, then the video started to disappear off and on, some times more off than on, until finally I gave up and ejected the dvd. This dvd is unusable and I do not recommend buying this dvd from this source. I did not contact this vendor about the dvd because I have not had good luck contacting used dvd vendors. I have learned to take my losses and they are piling up."
2,marginally watchable,"with badly scripted dialogue, stereotyped arrogant fbi attitude, cliched plot, annoying repeating flashback scenes, treating viewers like short-memory morons. norris looks very old and tired, with a plastic face-lift job still failed to block the over-the-prime action movie guy. the guy from mad tv played the ex eastern secret killer thug did a so-so job, because his facial figures were not vicious enough to convince me as a bad guy. norris should get out of the action movie role yesterday and be fairly warned not to become the 2nd steven seagal joke."
3,Entertaining,"Chuck Norris is back in a real movie. He's a private investigator specialized in locating missing people and when a Jewish diamond cutter is kidnapped, his daughter comes to Chuck for help.""The Cutter"" is no masterpiece but it's an entertaining movie and above average for production company Nu Image Entertainment, whose movies sometimes suffer from incoherent writing. Chuck Norris fans will be pleased to see Chuck, and the rest of the cast make a good job too.It's an entertaining movie, but perhaps not one you'd want to watch again and again. Chuck Norris fans would want to have this movie in their collection. Anyone else looking for 90 minutes of entertainment, rent it."
3,It was a nice Movie,This movie wasnt bad and it wasnt the best. The best Movie I seen so far by Chuck is Code of Silence but back the review. I liked this because Chuck is still fast in this movie even at 65. He was getting beat up too much tho. Overall this movie was good wasnt the best. But it something nice to watch
3,For Fans of the Series,"Double Dragon for the gameboy is not a bad game. It is though somewhat repetitive (something that haunts most beat em ups) and short. With only four levels you can blast through this in 30 minutes. The thing is though it is slightly fun and fans of this series will like this. More or less its a simplified version of the NES game which is also not a bad thing. I know this review sounds a little negative but I did like this game. Otherwise if you do not like Double Dragon or side scrolling beat 'em ups you will not really like this any way. It's short,simple and fun."
2,ok,"There is a scary fine line between good and bad 60s mellow rock"" The Association, the Free Design and Curt Boucher on one end, Harper's Bazarire and the Letterman on the other. This album sits right on that line.The band do ""Up Up and Away,"" and ""I just want to be your friend,"" as well as other surefire hits of the era. The arrangements are toned down from the origonals, as if the band were trying to take all the individual trates that made these songs interesting away, and make them into nice, harmless music. There are lots of giggles and cute little celeste notes, making the album safe for tots and mommy's alike.If you are a collector and like to have wierd little novalties from this era, get this cheap. If you don't, you won't be missing much."
1,Sublime Company,"They aren't bad, but broke no new ground. Better to listen to/acquire Love Generation, Free Design, Peanut Butter Conspiracy, Curt Boetcher, Fifth Dimension or even Eternity's Children first. (and thats assuming you've already explored more obscure Mommas and Papas, Spanky & Her Gang, and Jefferson Airplane). A footnote group that ALMOST had a hit with ""Up, Up & Away"" but had it snagged away from them by the Fifth Dimension."
5,Pork Chop Hill,Pork Chop Hill is a revealing look into what the last two years of the Korean War was like as hills along what became the DMZ changed hands multiple times. It vividly portrays the rough terrain and the up close and personal nature of the fighting.
1,I'm glad this book is out of stock,"It's a wonder how easily real trash can be published. Ru Emerson ignores completely the ancient Greek mythology. If she wanted to write about those times, she should have studied more that era. I'm glad this book is out of stock and I wish it were The Empty Throne, too. Their place is definitely in the dustbin."
3,"A pretty good book, but.....","This was a pretty good book, but could have been better. The character of Atalanta was already established in Hercules: The Legendary Journies and I had that character in mind when I read it. The Atalanta in the book and the Atalanta in Hercules were two totally different people (the one in the book is a complete jerk!) and that is one of the reasons I didn't like it. Also, the way Gabrielle was acting, too many ""Ooohs"" and ""Aaahhhss"". I can actually say I have never seen Gabrielle bite her fist over anything.I know how hard it is to write about established characters, it's not easy at all. All in all the author did a pretty good job."
4,"Not as good as Empty Throne, but still a must read","This book was awesome! The riddles were fun, and the characters were put on a very realistic level. While I enjoy The Empty Throne better, this is definently still a classic Xena novel."
3,hmmmm...,"Hmmmm... I'm having a hard time trying to decide what to say about this book. It's definitely a fun brain-vacation -- I will say that. I didn't mind the inaccurate Greek mythology that one other reviewer pointed out -- I mean, come on! When has Xena EVER been true to mythology! What really irked me about this book was the portrayal of Gabrielle. Yeah, I realize this book was written waaaay back when Gab was younger, more eager... but she is treated like a pre-pubescent giggly little teenybopper for crying out loud! When are they ever going to write some Xena novels for fans older than twelve!"
2,Have you actually watched the show Ru?,"This book was alright, but i have to say that some of the things Ru had said, well Xena would not do. This comment goes for the other Xena books he has written. Please try to be more true to the characters. To the Fellow Xenities: This book is an excellent addition to your collection, but the show will always be best. :)"
1,"Great toy, big disappointment...","After reading several reviews on all the life like race tracks we found this one and were impressed by all the positive reviews. We ended up buying it for our son's christmas present. Christmas eve we set it up, rather quickly and ran the cars around the track a few times. It worked though the cars fell off the track several times. Christmas morning he was thrilled, he wasn't rough in any way with it, actually ran the cars at a slower rate so they would stay on the track. It wasn't even 5 mintues later he was crying because one of the cars broke!! He was very upset and we have contacted the manufacturer several times with no help. A big disappointment, it was the present he really wanted and it only lasted 5 minutes. Not worth the money, I should have gone with my gut, remembering how these tracks never worked when I was a kid!"
3,Pros and Cons,"When I first started to read this book I was really taken in by the sight and sounds of the expericence that the characters had traveling. But as the book progressed I lacked the ability to connect with Jodie. As a parent, I also felt that the amount of freedom that Jodie had in a foreign country was unrealistic. Working side by side with people was realistic, but being gone for hours at a time spying on the group of girls was not. I felt that the subject matter was truely for ages highschool and older."
3,:),I enjoyed this book. it had interesting backround and I like the idea of writing much of the dialect in the language of Krio
4,"very very good, but could have been much better.","I first saw Rory Gallagher in Aug. 1974 after Tattoo was released, and went to as many of his concerts as I could. The first ""side"" of this cd is fantastic; raw, basic and very bluesy. The later dates don't really fit in with the earlier music. Rory started using effect petals and his drummer, Ted McKenna wasn't that good of a musician in my opinion. They also shouldn't have cut out ""In Your Town"" on this cd version- Rory plays superb slide guitar. The record company should have expanded the cuts from 1972 ( I'm sure there are some awesome un-released tracks )and leave off the ""Stage Struck"" material."
5,Simply the best,"Rory Gallagher was probably the most underrated blues/rock artist in the world. As guitarist, singer, and composer, Rory was unparalleled. Any of his albums is a good pick, but this set shows him at his best, in front of a live audience. A pure musician, Rory took a no-frills approach to his music, which was a nice contrast to the pretentious pseudo-artsiness of so many other performers of the era. For a good dose of the best high-energy music anywhere, you can't go wrong with this album. Rory is gone, but his superb musical legacy lives on. Thanks, Rory!"
5,Review,Great product was better than I expected got product with in 3 days went very smooth I would keep buying there product.
1,Ushio bulbs are better.,"I hate this bulb. It blew up after only a month. It isnt compatable with digital ballasts so get a Ushio bulb instead,or even a lumitek. just dont buy this one."
2,"Feature Rich, Poor Quality","I bought this television and took it back a week later. There was a bow in the lower third of the screen where one would expect straight horizontal lines. Additionally, when the screen was supposed to be fading to black, 3-4 inch wide dark black stripes appeard on the screen with a charcoal black color in between. In other words, the blacks are not consistent. I thought this was the best buy given the number of component inputs, HD ready, flat screen, etc.. and I got burned. Atleast I got my money back. Now I don't know what to buy. Thinking about the Hitachi but there seem to be people not happy with thise as well. Sony is the answer bu tnot sure I want to spend the extra buckx. I may just wait until later this fall (2002) to see what else becomes avail and buy a 27 inch for $400 until then at which time I can upgade the 13"" in the br with the 27."
3,Phoenix Digital Flash - It Works,"I purchased this flash as a slave for my Fuji S6000fd and it works like a charm, it fires as a slave either in Red eye reduction mode or standard flash mode, wonderfully lit photographs are the result once you get the manual setting right on the camera. I have not used it as an automatic flash on a hotshoe, and can only speak to it's quality as a slave. This item is manufactured in Singapore and marketed under several brand names including ""Bower"", ""Eyetek"" and sometimes just ""Digital. They all appear to be the same unitI would have rated this flash four stars if it were not the overall flimsy build quality, it does however come with a one year warranty. The bracket enclosed is a cheap piece of plastic that may be usefull to attach the flash to a tripod for a particular lighting requirement but not as a camera and flash bracket.I purchased the Stroboframe Quick Flip 350 Flash Bracket that is sturdy and works well with this slave flash."
3,Good solution for point and shoot cameras,This flash is a useful solution for point and shoot and bridge cameras for when additional flash power is required. It is easy to use and works well.
3,it`s good for beginners!,"i was specting a smaller flash but when i opened the case, i found a large unit, it can be set for any digital camera (also include a synchro cable) i have been testing a little and it`s good for beginners, `cause it`s hasn`t any other controls, i mean, it`s like a manual flash, no intense control, no aperture control, and no anything, furthermore, the bracket gives you a very fragile sensation.anyway, as a said, it`s good to begin but if you are looking for more advanced ends, you have to spend a little more"
1,did not work well on thick coat,"I tried to use this on my long-haired, thick-coated dog (she's Australian Shepherd mixed with something else and has a super thick undercoat). The prongs bent in the fur, would not slide thru even though I had brushed her out before starting, and the tips were very sharp so when it did pierce the coat it poked her skin and hurt. I whipped it off of the clippers and free-styled it. Next time I trim her, I plan to just buy a different length clipper blade for my clippers instead of using a guard like this one."
5,Why isn't this on the radio?,"This cd combines all the elements of music that I like. It has well-written music, heart-felt lyrics, and sounds that are different yet familiar. They combine excellent vocals and strong beats with some well-integrated guitar licks that form a style that should really fit well on the radio. Seriously, it sounds similar yet better to some things like Nickleback that do get heavy airplay. So why isn't this on the radio?Tracks that I especially like are ""Control"", ""Dreamland"" and ""I Won't"". If you want music that is good enough to be on the radio but for some reason isn't then give this cd a chance. There isn't anything played on the radio like this. [On their website] you can hear some of their music before you buyit. It is really the only way to get a good feel for what this band is really like.Enjoy!Paul J"
5,Superb Bibs,"Firstly .. get the right fit for your size and build.Secondly .. these bibs are superior for three reasons:1.) The straps aren't sloppy. They stay firm. They keep the bib firm for back support, which is a nice feature for us seniors. These bibs don't hang, they cling, and they support.2.) The Bibs are higher under the arms than most bibs, and snug. They keep cold drafts out and away from your lower back which, again, is a nice feature for us seniors.3.) They're flat out comfortable. I noticed it immediately. They're far more comfortable than any other brand of bibs that I've owned in this price range.For the price, these bibs are superb."
1,"Work well, but don't try washing them!","I bought these pants because I wanted ski pants with a bib. I skied with them several times and they worked well. They kept me dry and warm. The first time I tried washing them however, the pants ripped open and the stuffing came out. I have pants from a different company that I've washed dozens of times without issue.I'm not sure why I haven't seen the other reviews mention this. Are people hand washing them or something?One last thing, there's only one breast pocket, no side pockets. A minor complaint."
1,"Terrible sizing, very small","Bought these local in Large (my normal size (Approx 37"" waist) and I could NOT zip them.Returned and tried XL, still cannot zip but maybe an inch.Maybe they had a bunch not sized properly, not sure. But i cannot wear these."
2,order 1 size up,"I ordered these for my husband, and when they arrived we discovered the sizing is irregular. Order a full size up, the sizing for men's pants runs small."
3,Ill Fitting,"I haven't worn them in the cold yet but I did try them on at home. I ordered a medium size. I am 5'10"" 165 lbs. They are just long enough to fit me. I find the torso section a little tight. My main concern is that the pants portion is HUGE! They are like elephant pants. It looks odd to have a fitted torso and then a baggy pant. It's just weird. I can wear them and for the price I guess I got what I was paying for but yeah, definitely not overjoyed with the purchase. Also there are no side pockets, which makes me feel like I am wearing girl pants. Weird ill-fitting elephant girl pants. I would NOT recommend."
2,these snow bibs are for short fat people,"I am a very large person. I am 6'3"" and 330 lbs. I ordered 4xl because I wanted to be sure they would fit. There was lots of room in the belly but the shoulder straps were way too short. These would be ok for a short fat person, but are absolutely wrong for a large tall person."
1,you don't get what you pay for...,"I'm a 3X woman and thought that these would be a great deal...I could go out and play in the snow with my son! Not so, got these Friday before the big snowstorm hit, tried them on...what a joke...they didn't even come close to fitting...I should have been swimming in them as a men's 4X!!! My husband who is an XL was just comfortable in them...not sure who determined their sizes...but they run SMALL!!! We're keeping them, but only because my husband can make use of them..."
4,decent for the price,The only problem that I can find is that the zipper is not a two way zipper. You have to undress to use the bathroom.
2,they feel apart,The stitching on the zipper came out on the first use. Other than that I like the snow pants and would be a good but for the price if they stayed together.
5,Good for the $$,"Great for the $$, we only go skiing 1 time a year for a couple days so I don't need a $300 pair of ski bibs."
2,Pretty Poor Tribute Album With Nice Album Artwork,"To be fair I only listened to 30 second samples of the album songs @ [...]:I've had this album on the Save for Later section of my Amazon Shopping Cart for quite a few years mainly due to the cool cover art. However, I was hesitant to plunk down 12 bucks for it unless I heard it first. Well after listening to the samples I won't be buying this cd and will be removing it from my Save For Later section. The only thing that peaked my interest was the cover of ""Love You To"" which was more rockier thant the original Beatles version."
1,Listen to Real George,Short answer - listen to George doing his own work.This is a bust - skip this and get to some serious George instead!
5,KOH 6,i can't wait i've been counting down the days this is going to be the best season yet and i just can't wait i hope everyone will buy it
1,Great series that fox cut short,"Firstly, let me begin by saying that this is a great series that I truly love. However, due to Fox's disregard for fans of this show, I have to rate it only one star. I purchased season six the day it came out and eagerly opened it and found a notecard inside telling me to expect season seven sometime in fall of '06. I waited, and waited, and waited, no season 7. So really my one star review is for Fox. I understand that KOH may not be the most popular or best selling series around, but what about the fans who only have half a collection because Fox values large sales over the fans who actually do the purchasing. After seeing some of the junk available to purchase in stores and online, it really disgusts me that I only have six seasons of KOH to watch. Punky Brewster, Third Rock from the Sun, Alf, great series? No, but they are available for purchase in their entirety. FOX RELEASE THE REST OF THE SEASONS!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Show--Disappointing DVD format,"Absolutely love King of the Hill, I have Seasons 1-6! I must say that I am extremely disappointed that each DVD in the set has to be flipped over in order to watch all 7 or 8 episodes (3-4 episodes per side). Hopefully the next release will follow the lead of The Simpsons and have all of the episodes on one side."
5,Sex and the Serial Killer,"This witty, tongue in cheek, yet bone deep tale has a lot more to share than humor, steamy sex and fun twists and turns. Ms. Skully addresses those judgmental misconceptions humans are prey to which prevent our connection with each other and what we are really looking for, love and joy. Lest I get too mushy here, this was one heck of a fun read! I was reluctant for it to end and am looking forward to more of Ms. Skully's novels!"
5,Great Title; Better Book,"If you look at my other reviews, you'll see that I almost always read historicals, but I'm also a big Evonovich fan, and this book was recommended to me by the same friend who first introduced me to Janet E. I wasn't mislead. If you like sassy, won't-take-no-for-an-answer heroines, then you'll love Bobbie. And if you like hunky bad-boys (and I do!) then you'll like Nick even more.I simply like the heroine's pluck. She's not gonna let her ex dump her and make her miserable, she's gonna reinvent herself and make him drool! I can't wait to track down the author's ebooks. I've never bought an ebook, but for this author, I'm willing to go where I've never gone before . . .The book was a TOP PICK in last month's Romantic Times Magazine (which I'm also addicted to), and now I know why."
4,Sex and the serial killer,"Jennifer Skully is one of those authors I just happened to come upon browsing throught the book section of a goodwill store, and I'm hooked. I've loved every book I've read of her's so far. Her characters come alive and they're quick, witty and funny. I read this book in one day. Started it and couln't put it down. There were a few parts in the book that were lagging, but overall I loved it. Bobbie, the heroine is in her prime at 40. Which was interesting. Most of the characters I have read have been in their late 20's early 30's. So this was new and refreshing. Nick the hero in the story is pegged as a bad boy, but he is just misunderstood and these two have some intense sexual energy, and those scenes are worth reading!"
4,The Kings of American Lounge Cheese!,"What if the Ramones, AC/DC and the Beastie Boys were to play a run down hotel lounge in Vegas? The Recliners' 'Cosa Caliente' takes you to that magical place were Elvis and Tom Jones still live. Cosa Caliente is a must for any fan of cheese, and all fans of cheap thrills."
3,BUYER BEWARE,"I like Tim's work very much, but the main reason I bought this CD was for the Jeff Gordon song #29 on this list. It is NOT on the album, so don't be disappointed like myself if that's what you're looking for. Of course, I still like the rest of the CD -- Tim's a riot, I'm just disappointed that the song isn't on here! Does anybody know where I can find it?"
3,Expensive,A lot of money to pay for a mere booklet running thru some of Nick Humprey's usual ideas like Feedback Mechanisms. What's so magical about feedback mechanisms?
1,Not the Best Game out there,I bought this game thinking that it would be a great game butit has no saving capability and the graphics [are awful]. Don't waist your money on this game.
5,Compact Revisited,"Well this is the book that brings it all together, and the tragedy that involves Varzil the good's life, and the result of the adoption of the Compact.Unlike reality, wherein we can continue to create and utilize tragedies to create even more heinous tragedies."
3,Disappointing,"I found the book very disappointing. It did not at all feel like a culminating book of a trilogy; instead, it seemed to meander forward, from chapter to chapter. I have rarely before in the Darkover series felt a book that was not well plotted and developed. There was little driving force through the book, and by around 1/3 of the way through, I began to really feel like I was just slogging to the end.While the second book in the trilogy focused largely on Varzil and Carolin, the two major actors of the time period in question, this book focuses on two other characters. Their stories had a ""and then this happened....and then that happened....etc"" feel. Secondary character development was also lacking.Overall, this felt like too much treading water as the pages went by, followed by an unexpected (and unconvincing, given the 400 pages that had gone before) resolution."
1,Didn't last very long,"Black ink quit working after a year and a half of light duty printing. Printhead hopelessly clogged. What a waste of money. I'm going back to HP, and never buying another Epson or Brother again."
3,Overall it's pretty good with some annoying limitations,"This is my first ""all-in-one"" machine so I can't compare it to other models, I'm generally happy with this machine with its ablity to do anything under the sun with an amazing price.However after a while I noticed there are two annoying limitations:1. the print speed is extremely slow.2. it drinks ink like spring water! I got the ""ink lever is low"" after about one month of usage with about 30 pages being printed overall. What a surprise!Another feature I wish is to have a cordless headset, I read there is acutally a step up model with that feature, but it didn't receive good reviews.Even with these limitations I still recommend this machine due to its very resonable price and versatility."
3,Adequate machine,"Everything advertised works well. Just refilled ink without problems and since this has a (wifi) ftp memory card access I might be able to use this as a FTP server. Will test that. Only negative it doesn't recognizes the hangup after someone leaves a message and keeps recording the busy ton.A firmware update could help.(update) Works as ftp server, just redirect port 21 to printer's (static) IP and use any password & userID. Nice added bonus. But be careful when refilling the ink. There is a thin plastic container/bag inside the cartridge that needs to be resealed afterwards."
3,Brother MFC-665CW,"Nice machine but here are the drawbacks:1. Printing on an envelope is a disaster. You have to remove the tray, reset the sides and then print and then reset sides to your paper. Also, you HAVE TO USE THE PAPER TRAY in order to print a single copy let's say on colored paper. Poor design, other than that Other features are terrific. Would still buy again because I have a second printer that I now use just for envelopes."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is the worst printer I've ever owned. From day one we couldn't get it to print wirelessly. Only from a Mac, not the XP or Vista machine. After over a week with tech support we gave up, plugged it into a wireless router and managed to get it to work. Their tech support is miserable. There have been many paper jams, and it uses up the ink fast.Seven months later it quits working, the ethernet interface with the router went out. In my local, the tech support is now through a 900 number that charges $1.99 a minute - even though it's under warranty. And they say on their web site they are proud of their support? Proud at how much they rip you off for. With that type of service I will never buy another Brother product. Tech support will cost more than to replace it. But I will be replacing it with another brand."
3,"Great all in one, except when one is empty!","I've just discovered it's dirty little secret, and it's annoying. If only one of its four little ink cartridges is empty, the machine will not print! And these cartridges empty at different times, so you are going to have to have a supply on hand at all times, or you are not going to get that homework printed, that invoice mailed, or other important paperwork done when you need it most! If you are so organized that this is not an issue, then I recommend this machine for all of its other virtues, and I truly envy you!"
5,Good Product,"So far, I have found this product to be very good, especially for the price. I previously had a Brother product for almost 3 years without ANY problems and is the reason I wanted to replace it with another Brother product. I read the ""bad"" reviews, but I relied on MY previous experience and it was great. I received a defective machine on first order, called Brother Customer Service and received a new machine within 2 days along with return instructions and postage paid info. What happened to my other machine was the use of ""compatible"" ink cartridges - don't do it!! It ruined the ink heads and this machine was only a few dollars more than the cost to replace the ink heads."
3,Surprised and Disappointed,"I am an experienced computer user. I bot the MFC-665CW bec I wanted the functionality for light use. I ended up using a USB cable for connection bec the process to use 802.11g was long and arcane. The printing has been fine. I have faxed without difficulty. Yesterday, I tried to scan for the first time. No results. Got on the Brother website for support. Downloaded new drivers. Installation failed. Went to FAQs. Followed instructions (poor instructions, long procedures) to re-install drivers. Now I cannot scan AND I cannot print. I sent off email to Brother. They responded with the wrong help number. I waited 25 minutes to find out that they had to put me in another queue for 20 minutes. This is not what I call adequate customer support. I have, so far, spent around 5 hours on this problem."
1,Not reliable. Won't print black and white if out of color,"Answering machine crashed once a week. Had to be ""rebooted"" to reconnect to wireless about once a month.Mac, Linux support not great. I had to download drivers, the drivers weren't built into OSX and Linux.I printed only two photos, from then on I printed nothing but black and white, then one day it said it ran out of Cyan and won't print until I replace the cartridge."
1,Cost to Own: WAY TOO HIGH $$$$$$$,This machine is on of the most expensive printers/all-in-ones ive owned. If you are planning to really use your printer (more than a few pages a month) please take this into consideration: This Brother machine will completely disable itself if it has a low ink warning on ANY of the 4 inks. The ink levels are based on # of pages not actual ink used. I am very conservative and set this printer to low quality black and whit mode to save money. in 4 months I have had to change all the color and black inks twice- almost $200! Keep in mind i have not used a single drop of color ink. By comparison the same amount of printing would have cost me $11 on my Canon.
3,Propagandhi stuff was good,"I would like to say that I loved the 4 propagandhi songs that were on the DVD, the othe grups suked big time. The cuality of some bands was realy bad, sorry, but that true.I realy would like to get more propagandi videos.Thanx anyway, Martin Tansini"
3,"Helpful, but Chock full of Errors","While the general idea of this book was invaluable - I used it to help plan my own ""alternative"" wedding - the number of obvious errors in the book became a bit tedious after a while.For example, in Chapter 3, when listing songs, poems and passages to use in one's ceremony, the author incorrectly lists an Edgar Allen Poe poem and she gives credit to the wrong Rosetti for writing ""Sudden Light"" among other errors. She also refers to the Convocation or Introduction as the ""Charge to Convocation"" when it should actually be the ""Charge to the Congregation"". Also, when referring to various passages in the Bible, some of them are incorrectly refrenced as well. I could go on...At any rate, if you can get past all of the things that are incorrect in this book, there are some very helpful concepts."
3,"Informative, but very limited in scope","This resource is useful if you're trying to write the wording for the ceremony itself, and not for much else. It provides the basic format and content of weddings for a variety of religious and ideological traditions. Another redeeming factor is the collection of anecdotes and advice from others who have planned alternative weddings.However, the book's layout makes it difficult to read, and it lacks information about all the other aspects of planning a wedding besides the ceremony itself."
3,"Good starting point, but you'll need other references","This book is a good starting point for ideas for an alternative wedding, but you'll end up needing other references to flesh out your planning. I bought this and read it only once; I wish I had just checked it out of the library instead.The book isn't very well laid out, but you can find some good info if you dig through it.Ceremonies listed include Protestant, Quaker, Unitarian, Jewish, Civil, Religious Blessing, Interfaith Buddist, Baha'i, Spiritualist, Pagan, Druid, Humanist, Viking, Pacifist. Gay and lesbian ceremonies and Honeymoon/destination weddings are also covered."
4,"Nice instruction book, would have been better in hardcover","A step-by-step instruction in the techniques of Japanese restraint. Good illustrations and instructions. Not many full-color pictures, as this is more of a manual than an art book.My biggest let-down was the fact that it's a softcover, which doesn't allow for laying the book down to practice without risking spine damage to the book. I would have really liked to have this in the more rugged hardcover, or even spiral-bound, format."
2,"Self-Indulgent, inadequate illustrations","A mishmash. The major problem is that step-by-step instructions and CLEAR illustrations of basic ties are missing. Midori appears more interested in showing off her own skills and performance than in delivering what is promised: usable instructions for the beginner. Interestingly, the book is consistent with what I observed when I attended an evening ""seminar"" by Midori. Although it was advertised as step-by-step bondage instructions for the beginner, much of it was just Midori showing off. The ""instruction"" was poor and while Midori ""explained"" four different basic ties, she idiotically (contemptuously?) did not give any handouts at all, and there was not enough time left to actually practice and learn the ties.Midori, unfortunately, either does not know how to, or does not bother to teach efficiently. Hence I cannot recommend this book."
2,Not worth keeping,"I bought this book for a bit of spice in our marriage but quite honestly there wasn't much to the book. From memory there are 8 positions and they are very time consuming and involved. Some simple set ups and more diagrams and photos would have been appreciated for those of us that are time starved and don't want a hog tied, male slave outdoors (one of the photos). I can't keep hubby off me for the time it takes to set one of these things things up - I would need a cold water hose set to stun continuously. I sold the book as it was no use to me - I think I will get the Knotty Boys book next."
2,"A 7 photo ""art"" book?","This is a ""how-to"" book with good information BUT it has ONLY 7 photos (not counting the one on page 157). 7 photos for an art book?The title is great marketing but does not honestly represent the book's content. Where are the seductive images that tell a story and set a mood or theme? It reminds me of a cook book with a few color photos to show you what the dish should look like. Where's the art?I had expected to add this text to my collection of erotic art/photo books - Olivia, Nagel, Bettie Page, Joy of Sex, Illustrated Kama Sutra . . . alas this one doesn't fit. Instead of finding a prominent place on our coffee table it will go on the shelf next to my copy of ""Handbook of Knots & Splices"".Surprisingly, I couldn't find info on the models either including the popular Dita von Teese (bound beauty on the cover).The book does have very good illustrations & it will be well read for that reason. If it wasn't for that sole redeeming quality I'd be shipping it back - express!"
2,Do not buy this for the pictures!,If you are interested in this book mainly for great photographs of women in bondage pass this one by. The cover photo is a nice shot by the photographer Craig Morey but it will surely be a let down if you expect more of the same inside. There are only eight photographs in this book. Four of the eight are of men in bondage. The remaining four are of women. To make matters worse one of the four images featuring a woman is a duplicate of the cover image so there are only three additional photos of women. Also the only attractive woman of the four is the one they selected for the cover.If you are interested in techniques this might be the book for you but go elsewhere for sexy images.
2,A nice book if you have never done this before.,"Midori, the self proclaimed ""Fetish Diva"",has done a nice introduction explaining the aesthetics and brief history of Japanese style rope bondage. She goes on to describe a scene and analyize it, which was a little too long for me.The technique section was well done illustrating the various ties. Midori definitly has her own style. Cudos for showing male as well as female bondage. I did find the ties chosen to be very simplistic which is good for newbies but nothing new for those who have done this style of bondage before.I was dasappointed in this book with the limited number of different ties and lack of comlexity. I just expected more from Midori."
3,Informative,"The book does have nice photos that show the finished product.The drawings used for showing how to thread, lace and tie are not detailed at all.They are pencil drawings that show a general idea. If you require more detailed instructions i would not suggest this book.If you are an avid reader then this book is very enlightening and enjoyable."
1,"Cheaply made, the tablet doesnt dissolve well","I had a huge stomach ache after taking this. I then tried dissolving one of the tablets in water to see what happens, after 2 hours the tablet was not even dissolved yet! No wonder my stomach was in pain. I am returning the product."
4,Lost World- Jurassic Park,"This videogame has very good graphics for such a small screen. Each level you have to find a number of eggs, and the levels are winable."
5,Enjoy The Ride,"I have been listening to instrumental and surf music since 1958 and this CD contains songs with excellent composition, instrumentation, and playing passion. My investment is indeed of value. See the group perform if you can. Buy the CD and enjoy the ride!"
5,The White Stripes Rock!!,"I have two favorites on this CD: and thats Blue Orchid and Who's a Big Baby? Blue Orchid rocked and gave it a new meaning, and Who's a Big Baby is a great cheer-up song if you ever need one. the other two im not so sure about but those two definitely rocked"
4,Brilliant... and not so brilliant,"""Blue Orchid"" (the song) is a wonderful piece of rock'n'roll. Minimalist Goth, if you please - an organic version of Andrew Eldritch/Sisters of Mercy verse. As for the other songs... well, 2 of them are quirky. I HATE quirky. Jack seems to spend about 70% of his time thinking of ways to be different, and the other 30% making neo-classic rock'n'roll. Different for different's sake is just silly, and that's what the rest of this EP is - silly. Four stars on the basis of ""Blue Orchid"" alone - zero for the rest."
4,great survey of Buddhism,"This book covers the history, spread and influence of Buddhism in a concise clear and complete manner. As a Buddhist I can get lost in the various beliefs and how they relate to Christianity. This book clearly explains the important elements and how they relate to contemporary life. I read every word, and will refer to it when I get lost in the deeper teachings- it will re-focus me."
2,interesting for beginners,it is interesting st first but failed to elaborate more on the story of how buddhism came about
2,Marital Honking,"If she were'nt married to Joe Lovano, she'd still be doing bar mitzvahs and weddings"
5,Beautiful Relaxing Music,"Very nice, I love it, thanks for being so talented, it's very beautiful and relaxing , I can literally just close my eyes and fall asleep listening to this music, and I know for a fact that I will never have enough of this,and I love the album cover so much too, its as beautiful as the music, Keep up the good work, well done!! :))"
2,Overstuffed turkey,"This is not a good book if you want to get straight to the facts or a quick summary of what happened. Tight it's not. The author writes in a meandering style, interrupting the narrative with the life stories of every incidental character. I mean I could careless about the jogging habits of some lawyer involved in the case. The movie about Rosewood was not that great either. I think the whole story needs to be retold."
1,Christian Music Guide,"I gave this a low review score, mainly because it wasn't what it was made to sound like in the description. If you're looking for contemporary music industry contacts, so that you can pitch your music, this isn't the book.If you're looking for a history of contemporary Christian music, then this is what you're looking for. I felt ripped off."
1,Third String Partisan Hack Turns Propagandist,"Please see the Washington Post and its January 26, 2005 article by Howard Kurtz. This woman was paid tens of thousands of dollars by the current administration to help turn marriage into a partisan issue. Then she conveniently failed to disclose this relationship to either her readers or her publishers, carefully hiding the truth for years. She is a disgrace, a prostitute with a pen, third rate sophist paid to make the weaker argument seem stronger and the stronger weaker."
3,Wondering,"Would more women want to stay home and take care of the house and kids if we respected them for it? As of right now, women who stay home(or want to) are punished by people in our society we look down on them as though it is not real work. But what work could be more valuable than to raise the next generation?"
2,"Were the ""old days"" really better?","Yes, we'd all like to stay married forever (who marries with the intention of divorce?) and counseling is a must for troubled relationships. Divorce rates once were lower (at least in the recent past, not so if you go back further (200+ years) when it was more common), but I doubt couples were any happier. Many just went along to get along. We're also living much longer than people used to. In the past ""til death do us part"" might have been five to ten years -- today 40 plus! As a society we have no widespread experience with such long-lived relationships. People who think most people get a divorce at the first sign of trouble and treat their relationships as disposible are mistaken. Divorce is usually reached after years of agony. Most people who divorce say they would literally have died emotionally if they'd stayed together. That can't be healthy."
1,Uhh...,"With the exception of the first track (a well-arranged version of ""Tico Tico"" that includes a number of ringer musicians), the rest of this album is lifeless and dull. The improvisation is amateurish and sophmoric, the swinging is ricky-ticky and calculated. The constant overplaying and monotonic drone of the rhythm section gets about as creative as a drum machine.This album sounds like the result of a washed-up neo-swing group abandoned by its passing-fancy pop culture momvement and trying to reestablish itself as a legitimate jazz combo. No dice. The zoot suits and pompadors cannot save them now."
1,I'll pass,I made the mistake of buying one of the other New Morty Show records and then a friend played me a bit of this.Two words: I'll passSo inherently poor. This is a band with a terrible musical indentity crisis that is being displayed for public view. There are many glorious jazz records out there; this is a poor attempt at one.Highly annoying
1,"Thule LB58 58"" Load Bars (1Pr)","The Thule load bars that I actually received were only 50 inches long, and I needed the 58 inch load bars, so I really couldn't do anything with them. It specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars, but they were not. I even wrote amazon back to try and right the situation, but no one contacted me, so I had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length."
4,Solid Construction,"We purchased these bars for a 2009 Ford Flex. We bought the Foot Pack. If we didn't, we would have found out that the Bars did not come with the End Caps. The End are exposed Aluminum Stock. So the End Caps are required. For the price, I would have expected the end caps to come with the cross bars."
2,Not as pictured,"The bars themselves are fine, but the end caps pictured were not included. I sent Amazon an e-mail about the missing parts but never received a response."
4,Very noisy when driving at speeds over 30 mph,"These were extremely functional and safely were installed on the roof of our 2012 Honda Pilot. The downside is the extremely loud wind noise when going anything over 0 mph. The noise was unbearable at anything over 30 mph. Also, with the rack on, even with no load, the wind resistance was so great that we ran through fuel much quicker than usual. It greatly reduced fuel efficiency."
5,Easy to install,"The thule roof rack is very easy to install, very sturdy, and excellent quality. Worth the money for it's lifetime guarantee!!!"
4,Cliff Notes on OMA,"""What is OMA?"" - a collection of writings by varied individuals about Rem Koolhaas and the Office for Metropolitan Architecture - unfortunately amounts to Cliff Notes about the said architect and his design firm.Admittedly,when I bought ""What is OMA?"" I thought that the book would be an interesting discussion about the work and theories of Rem Koolhaas and the Office for Metropolitan Architecture. The writings either provide glossy insights into individuals' reactions to Rem/OMA or summarize his past writings relative to a current context.Interest in the Cliff Notes erodes with each consequent writing in a Baudrillardian fashion as the pieces rediscusses theories highlighted in Rem's ""S,M,L,XL"" and ""Delirious New York"".If one is looking for how other individuals look at Rem Koolhaas and OMA, ""What is OMA?"" may be for you. However, if you want to experience/read Rem Koolhaas and OMA at their best continue to reference books such as ""S,M,L,XL"" and ""Delirious New York""."
1,Awkward,"I felt like I was watching a high school film project. The acting is extremely over the top and at times, laughable. Many of the actors stumbled over their lines. I couldn't believe it when the credits rolled that the person who was the worst actor in this film was the director of the film! Ouch! The soundtrack was generic and painful as well. The placement of music into some of the scenes was intrusive and inappropriate. It was also impossible to connect to any of the characters because they simply weren't likeable or they just weren't fully developed. I understand that this is a low budget film, but for goodness sakes it is not worth 17 dollars. Truthfully, the only reason I purchased it was that my girlfriend's cousin is in it and we wanted to see how she did. She was just as awkward as the rest of the cast. Please rent this first before you buy it. Sorry to be cruel to all involved in this movie, but potential viewers have to know its flaws."
5,Great Independent Film!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the riches to rags to self discovery storyline. It kept me guessing how the main character would get out of his mess. Lead actor Michael Madison really showed dedication to his craft by growing shoulder-length hair and a hillbilly beard to get into character. Jill Wagner played one of the female leads. I recognized her as the Mercury girl from the car commercials. My only complaint is that she was not in it more. The other female lead is played by Scarlett Johansson's older sister. She has a bright future ahead of her.Overall, this was a great effort. It shows that you can make an awesome movie with no money. All you need is talent and determination. The music is another highlight. I don't know who did it, but it stuck with me.Looking forward to the next one. In the meantime, I recommend this DVD for information (commentary track) and inspiration."
1,Poor writing and a waste of time,"This movie is a complete waste of time. It misrepresents itself as being a zombie movie when it is an amateurish attempt at best. How can ""zombies"" be eating a woman and then in unison they all stop eating and run away? Are all the zombies on an eating timer? One minute, the zombies are running after you and the next they disappear, or they are patiently waiting in front of a door for one of the victims to run out. Don't waste your time on this film."
2,"Amazing cover, horrible movie","I am one of the biggest zombie fans out there. Gave it two stars for effort. Plot sucked. Dumb annoying kids. If you want a different, entertaining, low budget zombie flic pick up ""ZA Zombies Anonymous."""
2,Had potential but no dice...,"This film had the makings of a good zombie flick but some things just didn't come together. There were some cool things like the guy in the water, buy other things made no sense. Why did the bartender have the door unlocked but he had a shotgun when the kids came in. Just a little thing but, wouldn't you lock it? Also, why is it that in so many movie, the zombies eat someone and the apparently let them go so that they can kill someone else? The one kids' mom attacked him at home, and I guess he broke away and run 50 miles to the party and then changed huh? Or the guy in the bedroom with the girl who got grabbed but apparently off camera broke away and then later chnaged into a zombie, although he must have changed, ran off, circled back to the house and attacked right? Sorry, this was a good try. Work on the plot a bit and this could have easily been 4-5 stars."
1,"BAD , BAD MOVIE , NO DONUT FOR YOU","This movie is terrible , bad plot , tons of plot holes , bad acting , bad script , to be fair it has good efects and tons of gore scenes but that's it . Why everbody thinks they can do a zombie movie ? i see tons of horror filmes and the BAD ones are always about zombies , my god leave the poor dead alone ."
2,THE FIRST MOVIE IN SMUDGEVISION,"Automaton Transfusion looks as if it was filmed by a zombie using a hand-held camera. Picture quality is not quite out of focus but oft times not quite in focus. The army enlists the aid of a mortician to provide them with corpses so they can re-animate them to create an army of the living dead. As the head of the project says ""just think we won't have to send letters to grieving loved ones"".The movie is made on a low-budget and looks it but the gore scenes are ok but just as the heroes get caught in an impossibly dire situation..............fade to black-----To be continued. Looks like a sequel is coming....I think I'll pass."
4,"Fresh, New take on Zombies. Awesome !!","This movie was awesome. Independent films have a new headmaster.... Steven Miller. I had so much fun watching this film. I loved the camera movements, loved the actors/acting and especially the gore. Fun all 'round here bro. There were some production issues, especially with continuity, but, forgivable knowing it's true independent genesis. I thought the plot point regarding how/why the zombies came to be was a fresh, new idea. My only wish is that either the dialogue was lighter and funnier or that the actors didn't take themselves so serious. Next time, have more fun guys. I cannot wait for Part II.Loved the ending... Ballsy."
2,It's okay!,"I brought this movie because the reviews were pretty good. However, I was a pit disappoint, the acting was okay, not totally great. What I like about this film is that it was GORY!!!!!, the script was not so great, but then again it's an indie movie and it's not a George Romero movie. It' is a okay movie."
2,Has It's Moments but...,"These type of flicks are for low-budget goreheads only. There isn't much more going on here... I promise. There WAS a good amount of hype built up around this one prior to it's dvd release but after viewing ""AT"" I'll have to say I have no clue what all the fuss was about. Don't get me wrong, with a pizza, friend(s) and a few beers this one should work just fine but for all the good stuff I'd read about this one it definitely fell way short of my expectations. I give ""Automation Transfusion"" 2 and a half stars with a half star added for the fun cheesey gore."
2,Lots of gore but not much more...,"I was so excited to see this movie, as zombie movies are of my favorite genre. Let's just say, I was sadly disappointed. I ignored all of the bad reviews on here because sometimes a good movie can be overlooked due to people's inability to see the best in a film, that was not the case here. This movie really needed something more to it, it was seriously lacking in all departments, except gore of course. The end...well the end is what REALLY got me ticked. How dare they end a movie so abruptly!? Anyway, if you REALLY LIKE gore and don't require much more to be impressed with a movie, you could try this one. If you like more meat than potatoes....go with something else and stay away from this movie, especially at the current price tag."
2,Nice attempt but ...,"This movie started off really well. The introduction was solid. However, the movie fell apart along the way when you couldn't find the storyline. And you didn't share an interest in the two lovers. One character was remotely interesting and he was pretty good. The african american actor who was very good in the film. I admire the filmmakers enthusiasm and they did some very nice shots and setps but as a whole, it was empty and you didn't care or even remember the characters. And for the film ""to be continued"" was a little pretentious of them, assuming they would have a hit and garnered interest for a second film. Good shot, guys ... in places a lot of fun but fell short in the character and plotline"
1,NO ENDING !!!,"I just watched this, I won't spoil it for you, the director already did. It ends with buy part 2 if they ever make it? Trouble is I don't care if they do or not. I would not waste the money to see the ending. Some of the acting was OK, but it a 75 minute dvd that will make a better skeet target then video."
1,Sad Sorry Snoozefest,My goodness this was pretty low. Could only get through the first few minutes. Then just pressed the fast forward button for most of the film. The cover is awesomely gruesome. A book with same plot would have probably been better.
1,Awful,I typically enjoy B-Type horror flicks and I love zombie movies but if you are looking for a good B zombie movie dont watch this one. I took a chance and bought this before watching it and what a waste of 20 bucks. It is however worth renting but thats about all
3,average for the genre,"Now that all you drama queens out there have gotten it off your chest, this movie was simply average for the genre. I never got the impression that is was anything more than it was. I actually thought it was better than expected - which in itself is always a pleasure. I also thought for a new-er movie, it didn't suck nearly as bad as it could've - ""leeches"" anyone?"
4,An Awesome Zombie Flick!!!,"At first, I was kind of hesitant because the movie looks like it was filmed with an old camera, but as it progressed, it got hella better. The zombie gore was awesome! Even though I'm not a big fan of running zombies, I still loved it! One part is hilariously disgustingly sick is when there is a pregnant teenager at the party, then a zombie comes up and rips the fetus out and eats it. You can tell there will be a sequel because of the way it ends. I still don't really know what the title means. If you love zombie flicks, you'll love AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION!!!"
1,I would rate it lower if I could...,"DON'T JUDGE A BOOK, ER MOVIE, BY ITS COVER! I pretty much picked this movie up because the cover looked cool, and I never thought a movie could be THAT bad...but this movie proved me wrong. The quality is horrible. It's like watching one long, crappy webisode. When the camera moves, everything on screen gets blurred.The effects were cool, but that's the only thing this movie has going for it. The acting is horrendous, and the story is pretty much non-existant, and doesn't make sense. It's incredibly corny, and some of the kills are over the top...which would work in a parody film, but doesn't work in this film because they're trying to present themselves as serious.If you like to sit around and make fun of movies with your friends, then this is the prime candidate right here."
1,Oh. My. God.,"This movies was scary! Especially the bad acting and crappy camera work. Now, being a huge horror film fan, the name and box looked cool, but damn. I wasted $20 on this lame movie. I may take it back to Wal-Mart and say it didn't work, because it was TRULY THAT BAD!Okay, I won't go so far as lying and stealing, but don't be like me. Don't waste your money on this horrible film."
1,Absolutely the Worst......,"This movie was a total disappointment. First of all, to call it a movie is praise it doesn't deserve. This is a train wreck. It's entirely horrible acting, cheesy effects and no plot. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I may have seen worse but I'd be hard pressed to say when. It deserves a minus 10 stars. And I'm a zombie movie fanatic."
4,fun movie,"Automaton Transfusion is a great zombie film. It's fast paced, frantic, and has some great gore. Story's not top-notch, but most zombie movies don't have that anyway. The acting is hit or miss and some of the connections between characters are strained, but no worse than your average adrenalyn fueled action or horror film. Good film to add to any zombie movie collection."
1,Pick another movie!,"Believe all the other negative reviews! Every character in this movie is constantly having a tantrum, the gore is pretty cheap and lame. Even the zombies aren't scary looking. WTF??? Two thumbs down."
4,Good Gore!,"Well, I just finished watching Automation Transfusion and I can honestly say that I was entertained and satified. I agree with the other review about the acting and the plot, there both pretty lame. But really, what do you watch a zombie flick for anyway? The GORE right! And plenty of gore there is! The gore fx was done really well in this movie, so when you have good gore fx in a zombie movie, the plot and acting doesn't really matter does it? If you want good acting and a good plot also, I recommend George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead. If your just all about the gore, then Automation Transfusion should satisfy."
1,A Complete Waste.,"I remember before this film came out, all the anticipation that horror mags offered on this crap-bomb. It sounded like it was going to be good, the stills looked great, the cover art was awesome but.... This movie sucked. The acting was terrible, even for an indie low budget horror and to be honest this film isn't even worth mentioning all the things wrong with it. Not worth a rental and not worth the time to watch even if it is a free showing."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this movie because I read on bloodydisgusting that there would be zombies, gore, violence, and most importantly chainsaws. Technically, I got what I expected and should have been happy. Unfortunately, Automation also tries to throw a storyline and acting into the mix, and it fails miserably. I could have overlooked the bad acting if the film had been as zombie-violence heavy as I was lead to believe it would be, but for some ungodly reason much of the movie focuses on a nonsensical plot that seems to have been written as the movie was literally being filmed, and the movie, and its viewers, suffer because of which.One star only because it delivers on the violence, gore, zombies and chainsaws, more but mostly less. Expect nothing else, or you may end up like me at the end of the film: asleep."
1,suck fest,The only thing I can say is I wish zombies had broken down my door and eaten me right before I put the disc in my DVD player.Absolute crap.
1,Hands Down the Worst Move I've Ever Seen,"This was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. It was an impulse-buy 'cause the cover looked cool, and I'm a zombie-fanatic. And I was completely disappointed. I think the makers of this film and everyone involved should be barred from the film industry and any affiliated group. They shouldn't even be able to THINK about making movies ever again!"
2,Nothing new here,Fast moving zombies and survivors making their way through a desolate town. Seen it all before no new takes here but extra gory for those that like the guts.
5,Inspiring reading throughout the year.,"Aptly edited by Gary Wharton, The Last Days Of Messiah: The Week That Changed The World is the compelling story of the events, activities, and teachings marking the last seven days of the life of Jesus Christ, followed by His resurrection and the many appearances of the Risen Messiah culminating in the ascension and glorification of the Son of God. Drawn from relevant passages in Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and the writings of Paul, The Last Days Of Messiah is an engaging, ""reader friendly"", highly recommended account that provides reflection and remembrance which is especially suited for the Easter season, and will provide inspiring reading throughout the year."
2,Not worth 20 dollars,"i bought this dvd right when i got back from iraq. i thought it would be full of info about dx and his rise through wwe, well he only talks about dx for like 3 minutes, the rest and bulk is just full-length matches. if you wanna see a bunch of his matches, buy it. if you wanna learn about his career and all the different storylines....skip it. not worth the money!"
2,"good compilation, really bad title","i got much respect of triple h but the usage of ""king of kings, there is only one"" is not appropriate.try using ""king of kings"" on search tag and you'll find the real Man entitled to that phrase.on that note, ill just have to wait for other dvds that will feature those matches there. sorry."
1,Typical,"As expected, this DVD is filled with generic HHH matches which we will see for years to come since he now is part owner of the company. No documentary where the negative behavior can be pointed out. Convenient!"
1,this GAME is played and tired.....,"I will admit , I do not like this person. Going back to his devising the ""Montreal Screwjob"" on Bret Hart I think you can tell what a devious and self centered person HHH is. Don't get me wrong...I know wrestling is entertainment and not a sport but even at that ...I don't find this big lug entertaining in the ring. I'd rather watch the Brian Pillmans and Rey Mysterios flying around or guys who actually can wrestle like Eddie Guerrero or Bret Hart.This is a pretty straight ahead re-purposing of aired exhibitions with annoying self flatulation here and there. WWF or WWE or WWMcMahon went downhill in my opinion when this thug and SHawn Michaels became the gold standard. HHH is a natural Heel, he will never be a true Babyface... and this set is boring."
1,Not another HHH Video!!!!,I'm not impressed with the cover. I think he looks a little too godlike in it. What has he done that is so impressive? I don't buy pay-per-views to see him and won't buy this.
2,BODY FARM INSULTING,"At one time, I considered myself a big fan of Patricia Cornell, but Body Farm changed my mind. As a North Carolinian, I find Cornell's depiction of Southerners insulting. In Body Farm, she leaves no stereotypes unturned. Cornwell should be ashamed to turn out such tripe. I haven't touched one of her novels since"
2,Kay Scarpetta - Homewrecker,"It REALLY bothered me that the main character came off as a cold homewrecker with no conscience whatsoever. Nobody is perfect, but this woman's internal dialogue doesn't hint much at remorse over boffing a married man with CHILDREN!Simply put, the main character was one I did not care for, as she comes across as very self-centered and almost as sociopathic as the killers, in a way.I can't really get into a book or series if I don't respect the main character, or at least find them interesting. I found this book somewhat wooden and dull, and figured out the killer about one third thru, or even earlier.Should a main characfter be perfect? No, that would be boring, but at least have somewhat of a conscience. This woman seemed like a selfish ho."
2,Could have been 3 stars better.,"BUT the writing SUCKED. Its too bad I am so interested in forensic entomology, otherwise I never would have picked up this HORRIBLY written book. I DON'T care about Lucy's lovelife, or any of the other charcters' personal lives. Cromwell could have elaborated more on the the case instead of wasting time developing characters that weren't worth a hoot to begin with. Thanks for your time."
5,Reel Me In,"I loved Patricia Cornwell's Body Farm. I am from Knoxville and loved reading her accurate views on that area. Her research was excellent, I could ""see"" everything she describes in Knoxville, from the airport to the hotel. I even worked in the restaurant that Dr. Scarpetta visits on a UT game day. Her writing hooked me so fast that when I finished it, I bought several others to catch up on background investigations. This book has made me a Patricia Corwell fan."
4,Better than watching paint peel...,"So, Patricia Cornwell sets a tail in my backyard. Western NC isn't quite as backwoods as she would have you believe, in fact, when I delivered the NY Times, I had more Black Mountain customers than any other. Anyway...nice tale. Everything is bit too tidy, however. I'm a little concerned about her product placements within the tale too."
4,"Good plot, easy to read","I enjoyed reading this very good plot, although her niece's lesbianism is unnecesary to it. I do recommend this thriller."
4,Good Read,First Patricia Cornwell book i have read. Very easy read. Would read more of her books in the future. Highly recommended.
1,No Challenge,"The Body Farm starts off with a bang; the murder of an eleven year old girl with a secret, and a serial sexual predator who may or may not have been her assailant.But, the pace dies quickly as the plot is diveretd to Kay Scarpetta's niece, a student in Quantico, and a strange red herring of a conspiracy plot to get her out of the picture? Or just to waste the reader's time. I couldn't decide.I thought the title of the book was intriguing and felt ready to settle in for a good murder mystery. But less than halfway through the book, the solution to the crime seemed so crystal clear, I merely thumbed my way through the remainder of the book.SPOILER ALERT: If you're familiar with Munchausen's by proxy, this book will hold no surprises for you, so if you're looking for a murder mystery that will stimulate your grey cells, please don't waste your time with this book."
4,entertaining page turner,"If you're new to kindle. this is the ideal book to break it in. Amazon kindle promises to create a medium which just leaves you with the words and emotions of the text. This is the first book I read on kindle, and it was an enjoyable experience. The book is lightweight crime fiction, (and I don't mean that in a dismissive sense) but I enjoyed her style of writing very much and it was definitely a page turner, with many interesting themes interwoven. It is written in the first person, very successfully, and her depth of research and engaging style was convincing and needed no leap of disbelief. It has a good ending, with an opening for other books in this Scarpetta series, and more chances for us to piece together the real Patricia Cornwell. There are no explicit sex scenes (thank god), but it is a sexy book. I want to read more of Cornwell's works, and they are all on Amazon kindle :-)"
4,The body farm,A very excellent read. I could not put it down. I read it in record amount of time. Loved the book.
3,Quick moving,"Moves quickly and it you want a book to read on a plane flight, it's OK. I learned a little medical jargon, as is true with most of her books. It did make me want to visit southern Virginia and eastern NC."
2,the Body Farm,It was an easy read. It wasn't very thrilling and it was easy to predict. Just average on my scale.
4,First Cornwell book,"This was the first I have read of Patricia Cornwell, but it will not be the last. I picked it up used and figure it was a bargain. When I started it I was at a Dr's office waiting and couldn't wait to get home to finish it. Actually I couldn't sleep and read all night and did finish it that very night. I can't wait to go back and start the first of the series."
3,Below average for Scarpetta series,"I liked most of the Scarpetta books so far, but this one is below average. For some reason Patricia Cornwell decided to mix murder mystery with cheap third-rate romance/jeolousy story. That portition of the book took away quite a bit from the main plot and made the whole story cheaper and somewhat boring. If you like the rest of the Scarpetta books, go ahead and read this one as well to get the complete storyline. If you are just sampling Cornwell's books, this is not a good one to start with. I am giving the book 3 starts since there is still a decent plot and the writing is mostly pretty good, although it is more 2.5 stars - as I said, ""below average"". I was glad to see that in the next book the romance/jeolousy thing was given less consideration."
2,uh.........no thank you,"Honestly I only read like 3/4 of the book. This was my first attempt a a Patricia Cornwell novel and probably the last. The murder they are investigating seemed interesting from the beginning but the little side story about Lucy was simply a distraction. What bothered me the most was that so much attention was paid to conversation that I had no idea where the characters were going, where they were standing, what they were doing etc. I started to wonder if this was a sequal to another book because there were so many things that to me (not very knowledgable about forensic terms, departments etc) were left poorly explained or not explained at all. I heard so much about this author and for my [partial] first attempt I am not impressed at all."
1,Don't bother,"I was expecting a gripping murder mystery... when in reality it was a glorification of the main character in dressed up language that provokes no thought. This book simply feeds simple images and personas into the readers' heads and does nothing to stimulate a thought process. I was very disappointed when I found out on pg 383 that I had been right since pg 40. The storyline is remotely creative but the answer to the ""mystery"" is painfully obvious through the entire book."
3,"Not as interesting as it could have been, but OK.","The most interesting thing about this book is the fact thatthere really is a body farm in Knoxville, Tennessee. It isthe brainchild of Dr. William Bass, a world-renowned forensics expert and retired University of Tennessee professor. The exact location of the farm is unknown except to forensics students, police, and others. The farm recreates, with dead bodies, different scenarios of death, and its research has been invaluable to the science of forensics. I hope in future books Cornwell uses the real-life laboratory of the Body Farm to help Dr. Scarpetta."
2,Too Predictable,"Although I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Ms. Cornwell's books to date, I was unimpressed with ""The Body Farm"". I found it was too predictable, particularly for those who enjoy this genre (movie, print or television)."
4,Very Very Good,"The Body Farm is another excellent book from the Kay Scarpetta series. This time the majority of the novel is set in the Mountains of North Carolina, where a young girl named Emily Steiner has disappeared and was found murdered. It seems Temple Gault is the perpetrator of this foul deed. However, as the story unfolds and more bodies are found, other suspects emerge. Also, Lucy, Kay Scarpetta's niece, now a Senior at UVA and an intern at the FBI facility in Quantico, runs into quite a bit of trouble with the law. On top of the thrilling nature of the story, Patricia Cornwell also complicates the personal lives of our protagonists Scarpetta and Marino. If you like Scarpetta, don' miss this one. If you haven't read any of the books in the series, then start with cruel an unusual, because it leads into this one."
5,very very good.. keeps your attention!!,"this book is so amazing!! i was getting bored with other books and i just couldnt find anything interesting to read. these books are so good. they are truthful and they take you into the forensic world. i read this one first because i didnt know it was part of a series but now im going back to the first book to read all of them. so far all the ones ive read, ive read them in like 2-3 days. i cant put them down. and theres no point in the book where i was getting bored. it keeps going and going and going. they are truly amazing books!! good job patricia cornwell!!"
1,Only Paid a Buck for the Book,"If you can find this book used and need kindling to start a fire, then I could recommend it. I was lucky enough to only invest a buck in this book. Authors who write in the first person shouldn't; those whose protagonists use or otherwise have to interface with computers ought to spend a little more time understanding the terminology.I realize that this book was published in the middle 90s, but the author's command of computers and the incipient internet seemed as though she had spent an evening with one of her friends doing her research over cocktails. No clue....it was at that point that this book became kindling."
1,What a Yawner!,I definatly don't recommend this book to anybody! I could barley keep my eyes open through it because it was so boring and didn't hold my attention. I didn't care about anybody in the books. They all seemed like sleezeballs to me....lesbians and people having affairs! This book was pure trash.
2,This book Stinks,I found 'The Body Farm' to be boring and obvious. The first thing I noticed was it took about 14 pages to even say the main characters name! I thought the main character was a man till the 8th page or something! The writing is dry and un-imaginative and not detailed in a way that makes you want to get to know the people in the story.Not really impressed I don't think I will be ordering anymore Patricia Cornwell books! It is amazing how highly acclaimed this author is. Dean koontz now that's a writer!
2,Body Farm--a total yawn,"Somewhat exciting but essentially empty. It made me ask myself why I even read Cornwell books at all. It's just ""CSI"" in book form, with gratutitous adultery, cross-dressing and homosexuality thrown in for shock value. The story wasn't even woven together as tightly as an episode of ""CSI."" Why spend 3 hours reading this stuff when you can watch the same kind of story in 60 minutes then use the other two hours having a real life.Not the worst book I ever read, but close enough."
4,Nice Work,"I read this book and also read From Poter's Field, both books were very good. I found them very engrossing and thorough. Living through the life of Dr. Scarpetta was interesting. She gave very good insight. I whole heartedly recommend this book to any one who likes mysteries."
3,Bone Farm,"The mystery was very interesting and captivating waiting for the results. The profane language was not necessary, I did not enjoy reading through all the profanity."
3,"Liked it, didn't love it","As the title of my review states, I liked the book, but I didn't love it. Why? Well, I found it to be a bit predictable for one thing; I figured out the killer and the motivation long before the end. That was a let-down for me. I like murder mysteries to be, well, mysterious. Then there was the ending, which was anticlimactic. And the title, ""The Body Farm."" Why call it this? The Body Farm wasn't even in the story all that much. There's a brief mention early on when Dr. Scarpetta asks that an experiment be conducted at The Body Farm, then there is no more mention (that I noticed) of the experiment or The Body Farm until chapter eighteen. Even that was brief. The story was about the murder of an eleven-year-old girl. So why not name the book something that reflects this? I just don't get it. But, as I stated, I liked the book. I don't regret reading it, though I do regret buying it."
3,Easy fast read and entertaining enough,"First book I've read from Ms. Cornwell. Heavy on the forensic detail and light on the romantic relationships. Dr. Kay Scarpetta is a complex and well developed heroine who's fearless and intuitive. For being a lawyer/ME/FBI consultant she's a very good detective. I guess her weakness would be relationships (romantic and family) while her strength is her work. The killer was easy to deduce, not much of a mystery there and a bit over the top. I felt like something was still missing in this story, but would still want to read more of the Scarpetta books. Maybe I should start with the first in the series instead of in the middle."
5,Very cool !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I,am 11 and my grandma showed me these books when i was 10 andi've read all of them I think this is the best one since""postmortom"". Carrie is bieng mean to lucy it is not fair. I think that kay should slap her rottin sister. If mrs. cornwell reads this you should have benton divorce connie and have him marry kay. (you got to read this book people)"
3,Enjoyable but not impressive,"This was the first Patricia Cornwell I've read, and although it was reasonably engrossing I can't share the enthusiasm of her fans. Her narrative is good and the dialogue is sharp, but her descriptive passages are frequently awkward (just what do ""shadowy deer"" look like?).Overall, I found the characters more interesting than the plot, although you certainly won't guess the identity of the killer. I didn't care for the occasional snide potshots at liberals, as if only people who share Cornwell's conservative views are capable of sharing her moral outrage at the brutal murder of a child. These asides contribute nothing to the plot and are distracting; however, judging from the other reviews posted here, Cornwell's readers are a pretty conservative bunch anyway.I'd recommend this book as a light read for those with a special interest in forensic pathology (Cornwell's research is quite good). As a crime novel, it's hardly in the top rank, but you won't be bored."
2,"wallis and edward ""not really""","I have always been intrigued by the story of the duke and duchessof windsor, and I think that there is more to the duke than what meetsthe eye. I have yet to see a film version that captures the essenceof these two people, this one included. They did get the ""chicness"" ofWallis' wardrobe right and there was definitely a touch of luxury in the scenery."
3,Me gustaban más antes,"Los Enanitos Verdes son grandes escritores de música y magníficos intérpretes, no tengo que confirmarlo ya con tantos años en vigencia. Aunque personalmente pienso que en este disco no hay ninguna canción de aquellas épicas de Enanitos Verdes que bien conocemos. Yo escuché Enanitos Verdes hasta el disco Planetario (sí, hace mucho tiempo en 1997) y hasta ahí me gustaban mucho. Espero que en el próximo disco retomen sus raíces.Ninguna canción de este disco está para un grandes éxitos de Enanitos Verdes, sin embargo las canciones más rescatables de este disco son:A las tresMariposasEsta mañanaManzanaMe permití soñar"
5,Something different!!!,"I was expecting something like Amores Lejanos... but what was my surprise?? something totally different!!! In this new CD enanos explore new sounds in songs like SOLA, TENTACION and my favorite MANZANA... they also delight us with a Mujer Maravilla style EL VIEJO, without mentioning ELENA.. Every song has a style different... En fin... enanos lo han hecho de nuevo... AGUANTEN ENANOS!!!"
5,best coffee I ever tasted!,"I had this coffee while visiting Vietnam. Robust,fruity,yet with no bitterness. Perfect any time of day. Just had to have it when I got back to the US. Worth the long search for it in US Asian-style markets. Now I can buy it on line! Thank you Amazon!"
1,Improper representation,"While this coffee is an excellent coffee, it is not properly described. It is represented as ""all-Arabica"" and ""light.""Trung Nguyen Premium Blend is distinguished by being a blend of three different bean types and a small touch of cocoa, and ""spices"", as listed on the ingredients. It is Arabica, Robusta and Excelsa, otherwise known as Chari. It is not a light coffee, it is quite strong, like most Vietnamese coffees.This seller does not understand the product or list the proper ingredients, and I suggest that buyers look elsewhere for the proper representatives of the product on the Internet. Trung Nguyen products do have authorized Internet resellers that feature proper descriptions and pricing.It is not acceptable for a seller to misrepresent the major ingredients of a product to the buying public. Particularly on a product that also has non-coffee ingredients. Buyers who may have allergies should be aware of the ingredients."
5,Taste great!,"The smell is wonderful! the taste is better, I am ordering more this time. We were sad when we ran out."
5,Great Coffee,"I truely enjoy this coffee. Vietnamese Iced or just make a cup, it is a delight to drink anytime. Add some to a bottle of water and allow it to steep overnight. Best cold brew ever."
5,great coffee,"Got used to this coffee in Vietnam but hard to find unless you go to a ""Little Saigon"" somewhere. Shipping costs make it spendy."
5,Awesome,The dawn of electronic music. A must have for anyone. Wendy is phenominal. I have this on vinyl and the CD brings forth a much greater amount of subtleties.
4,a favorite commute and roadtrip album,"Snappy remixes, solid club sounds. The remix of Tori Amos' ""Professional Widow"" is superb, and ""Don't Stop Movin'"" is likewise noteable.Sorry the other reviewer did not like it, I'm guessing club and deep house are not his/her thing."
3,Hard shell Review,"Item protects the lantern just fine when closed.And the cover is compact, taking up no more room than necessary. When the top is off it provides a solid stable base for the lantern.It also provides a small storage area for mantels and spare matches. My only real objection is that getting the lantern off and on the base. It is a real terror. And getting the cover off the base is just as difficult. I did get the carry case in pretty cold weather so Perhaps when the weather is warmer it will be easier, at least I hope so. All in all it is does just what it supposed too."
1,Godzilla is so.........POKEMON?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"This is the kind of game where you expect it to be fun. The thing is, THIS IS NOTHING LIKE GODZILLA PERIOD!!!!!!! I mean, you don't even breath fire, the music's stupid, Godzilla's a character from Bust-A-Move, and it's a puzzle game! G-fans, don't even bother."
2,This Game Is Impossible!,"This is quite possibly one of the hardest games to beat ever made! EVER MADE! The control of the charecter is jerky at best. No matter how hard you try to work the control, it's going to mess up & put you in a situation where you have to start over again. However, as frustrating as this game is, I give it 2 stars because the character design amused me & the music was interesting. Hopefully the next ""Godzilla"" video game will be better!"
3,HARD,This is a difficult and addicting game. Godilla really is the cute monster with a fist bigger than him. It is kind of fun.
5,Shystie,"Shystie is one of the best female MC's I've heard in a long time, but she is underrated. Many people do not even know about her music. This album is the type of album that I can play without even changing a song with the exception of one or two songs. I rate each song as follows:1)Intro- 3/52)One Wish- 4/53)Gutter- 5/54)Step Bac- 5/55)Woman's World (Stand Up)- 4/56)Questions (Game Show)- 5/57)Make It Easy- 4/58)Unfinished Bizzness- 5/59)Bank Robbery- 2/510)Get Loose- 3/511)Can't Play- 4/512)Skit- 3/513)Somedayz- 4/514)Armshouse- 2/515)Juiced- 2/5"
1,waste of money,"Much better choice: ""Sweetlife-Adventures on the Way to Paradise"". This is written by Manilow himself.I think he's a bit more accurate than this writer.Although much of it sounds like direct dictation fromBarry's book anyway, so there ya go."
1,Not even worth one-star; save your money!,"I think the credibility of this ""tome"" is questionable as there are no ""sources"" quoted who are currently close to the entertainer, and the only quotes from Manilow himself are passages ""lifted"" from his own autobiography.Some of what appear as ""fan quotes"" seem to end up painting these people as less ""fans"" than ""obsessed fanatics,"" caught up more in the man than the music.I admit, I only skimmed it... but it was enough to give me an idea that it wasn't worth a full read."
1,Mission Impossible,"Let's see ... your assignment, should you choose to accept it is to write a ""tell-all"" bio of a famous singer. Thank heavens for the internet, it's easy to copy old reviews and articles (none past 1980). Family secrets ... oh there's a few. Put his mother in a sanatarium but never mention her again. For grins and giggles, interview disgruntled family members and/or former employees who are upset that they have been ignored all these years, and while we're at it, insult your buying audience by the 2nd paragraph. Wait for the buyout sale at the Dollar Store and in the meantime, study ""how to win friends and influence people""."
2,Unauthorized and unfair,"This book makes Barry Manilow and his fans look like they're in competition for the outcast award. If you want to read all the negative articles and comments Butler could find about Barry all in one place, then this is the book for you! If you are a loyal fan, not a wacky, love-struck, ""middle-aged housewife"" (as his fans are often called) read this book if you dare."
1,This Book is Trash,"This book was a comlete an utter waste of time and money. I threw it away rather than resell to an unsuspecting buyer. Totally based on gossip, rumors, and disgruntled acquaintances of Mr. Manilow. It is an unathorized biography and Ms. Butler has never spoken to Barry Manilow. How do you write someone's life story without accurate sources? She also trashed Jim Morrison and had some sort of scandal about a scholorship fund or charity she promised the profits from that book to. I don't believe a word she writes about anyone or anything. Save your money."
3,A Good Companion to Guerrilla Marketing,"I read this book before I read the book that started this whole series (Guerrilla Marketing- Highly Reccomended), and I can say that it definitely has a lot of ""tricks of the trade"" to save a small business money on advertising.The problem I felt with this book, was that it was more of a product showcase then a real resource. It basically told you about certain things you could do to save lots of money on marketing and advertising, and then listed a certain company in conjunction with that service. While it was informative, I felt sometimes that I was trying to be sold on certain products.I offer this suggestion: Read this book after you read Guerrilla Marketing. I think it best serves as companion to that book."
5,A must have book for winning greater market share.,"This book by Jay lenvinson & Seth Godin, two gurus of marketing, is an essential tool for all small businesses whodream of becoming market leaders.Packed with practical examples of marketing that delivers results, this book will become a repeat reader for any one who cares about market share.I have rarely come across any other books that can claim to be so simply written on a difficult subject and at the same time so effective."
5,Great Book!,This book really helped me out with some great marketing ideas. The information could be updated a little. Some of the companies listed are no longer in business but other than that it was a great read! The book encourages you to make a marketing plan and walks you through it step by step. A must read!
2,this is NOT true guerilla marketing,"The authors' use of the term ""guerilla marketing"" is completely inaccurate. This book is about TRADITIONAL media -- guerilla marketing is the complete opposite. It was also written in 1994, before the advent of the commercialized Internet, so it's a very very very old school approach to advertising. It has some good information about traditional advertising for small businesses, but most of the reference information is way out of date. If you're looking for subversive, alternative approaches to marketing, read ""Under The Radar"" by Bond & Kirshenbaum instead."
4,Great but a little long in the tooth ...,"Great information but a little dated. The book was written in 1994(?) so some of the presentation is ... meh. But there are still some great concepts and information to be had. Still worth the price, but it would be great to see a new version."
3,Quality is NO Victorinox,"It's a great concept to no have a knife to meet the TSA restrictions. However, it's basically a glorified nail clipper if you ask me. The scissors' metal gauge seems a lot thinner that it can barely clip my nails which is what it's suppose to be doing. As my title had mentioned, it's no Victorinox. If it has the same quality as Victorinox knife, that would have been great. I'm not sure if it's worth the money for a Wenger."
2,Not great tool selection,"Glad that the Swiss Army people finally made a TSA compliant product, but the tool selection is fairly bizarre. There is a scissors (fine) and a nail file (fine) but the only screwdriver is an eyeglass screwdriver, no regular screwdriver. A screwdriver is one of the most useful implements on a pocket tool, and I cannot understand why there is not a normal one, even if it were the end of the nail file. The Leatherman TSA tool has a large bottle opener (in my mind, not needed) but at least it has a screwdriver (as well as a pliers and scissors.)"
2,misleading,this is not a knife!! since it has no blade at all & furthermore could be mistaken in the airport & taken away anywayit also is not made by Swiss Army- they refer you to Wenger
4,Worth the money,"A little rough in the finish department, but a quick once-over with a piece of steel wool and some ACE hardware E-lube on the screws and these turned out to be a very pleasant surprise, value wise."
5,6-inch Wood Handscrew Clamp,"This clamp is well made and works very well with the INCRA box joint jig that I am using. This clamp fits the cross bar like a ""glove""."
3,Get the color version instead,"Marble Madness is one of my all time favorite arcade games and it has been ported to almost every other platform. This Game Boy version is faithful to the original but...The game requires a lot of pinpoint agility and with the GB's small screen and control mechanism, that's sometimes hard to accomplish. You should also look for the Game Boy Color version instead of the B/W version."
1,Inaccurate information in review below and Philips website!!,"Both the review below and the Philips website descriptions of this product are inaccurate as of 7-9-2002 and should be removed. This set does NOT have component video imputs or s-video imputs the review below and the website claim. The set does NOT have the dbx hi-fi sound as the Philips website claims. This is a very basic set with a flat tube. If you want a mono TV to use solely with coaxial cable or off-the-air reception, this may be a good choice, but if you want the set described in the review below or on the website, don't buy the Philips 20RF40S."
2,Not the features I was looking for,"This TV has an excellent picture, especially when connected to a VCR or DVD using the video connection in the front. However, it does NOT have S-Video or Component Video, despite the fact that Philips' web site said it did at the time that I bought this, and I also read elsewhere that it does. Apparently there is some mistaken information floating around about this particular model. Since I bought it based on wrong information on Philips' web site and elsewhere, I was disappointed to find that it did not have the superior connections."
3,SHIRTS SHRINK.,"Shirts are okay but they shrink. Need to buy a size larger than you need. Unfortunately, I bought 3 before I realized. Going to see if my son wants them."
5,Impressed,"I was pleasantly surprised at the material and workmanship of this shirt. The XL size runs about the same as you find in stores. The length of the shirt I received is a little longer than usual, more like for a tall man."
1,Why was this book published ?,"This is an over-extended magazine article in hardcover. It has nothing new to say, says it in a languid and laborious manner, and frankly should not have been published. It has no resale value used as the prices show and is remaindered everywhere. My copy is off to the recycling bin.This book is totally vacuous"
4,Suspenders,It's a great alternative for gentlemen that like wear a belt and suspenders. My father loves it!
5,GREAT SUSPENDERS,MY HUSBAND LOVES THE WAY THESE SUSPENDERS ATTACH TO HIS BELT. THESE ARE A DRESSY MATERIAL COMPARED TO THEIR OTHER STYLES
3,Disappointing Ending,"I liked this show when it was on tv, so I decided to get the DVD. I hadn't seen the last few episodes, and was very disappointed by the ending. There wasn't any closure or real ending. The characters and their story lines came to a screeching halt. The finale should have been at least two parts. There were alot of added characters in the last episode and some of the main characters ad few to no lines. It was a waste to watch all of the episodes to have no ending. If you haven't seen the last few episodes, don't buy the DVDs. Save your money and time. Nothing changes for the characters in the end. The series ended when they decided to cancel it. It seemed like they were told to show the episode airing that week and that's it. The end. No big finish. No send off. Nothing. Done."
3,Grosse Point comedy,"This is ""light entertainment"" pulls you in but is disappointing that it is not ended in a proper fashion. Characters are good, quirky and entertaining. 7out of 10comedy"
3,Grosse Pointe,"The show is about teenagers as actors. Hunter is a devil. She always wants things her way, and stirs up strife, to get it. Show was ok,started out well, but started to die down, hence, only one season. As it was by Darren Star, I expected much better.Grosse Pointe - The Complete Series"
3,Four stars for comedy. 1 star for picture quality.,"One or two great laughs per episode, with a lot mildly amusing bits. But the picture quality is absolutely terrible for some reason. If I hadn't opened the shrink-wrap on the dvd set myself I'd be certain that someone had swapped these dvds out with cheak knockoff downloads or cams."
4,"Funny, Fresh, and Poignant","I had actually never seen this show when I decided to buy the DVD but I had read positive reviews that had peaked my interest, and as a fan of the Teen Drama genre, I thought it sounded like a fun show. Honestly, it wasn't what I expected at first. Grosse Pointe is much more over-the-top then I had anticipated, sort of a Popular type of show.But once you get past that, it's actually a really enjoyable show to watch. The characters are interesting, there are plenty of high profile guest stars (such as Sarah Michelle Gellar, Kristin Davis, and the girls of Popular), and the episodes deal with common, yet comical situations encountered on a television show."
2,Very nearly worthless,"If the redundancy were eliminated, this book would shrink to fifty pages. I kept waiting for the author to share something worthwhile with me, but finally gave up halfway through out of sheer boredom. Anyone looking for a better book need look no further than Brian Tracey."
5,Raising a G rated family in an x-rated world,Iappreciated the concrete advise. It's enjoyable and refreshing. We need this hopeful information in raising our children. I especially liked the hug card and the report card.
1,Astonishingly backwards,understanding? responsibility? self-control? these words mean nothing to you because you just got out of rehab/prison and God help you if you enter a Chili's and see the bar. you'll regress instantly of course.
5,THOUGHTS AND IDEAS TO HELP MAKE FAMILIES SUCCESSFUL,"This book is outstanding. It represents all the Christian values used by the founders of the United States. It gives the reader excellent ideas that can help make a happy family even happier.Stories and comments bring into focus the importance of the family unit. The authors have been honest and sincere about their own experiences. It is so refreshing to hear about two young people raising such a large family. It surely takes unbelievable courage to bring seven children into this world.Brent and Pheleica are wonderful examples. They are, without question, qualified to offer advise and council. They remain humble and willing to learn as they raise their wonderful family.Everyone should read this book."
4,Simple ways to improve parenting,"This book provides neat insights from experienced parents. It served as a friendly reminder to stay with the time-proven basics in parenting, despite the onslaught of filth in the world."
1,A must buy...,"...if you want your kid raised backwards and socially inept. If your goal as a parent is to make sure however many kids you have are unable to function in modern society, then this book is for you. Brought up on this book, your child will be kept safe in his bubble until you feel it's safe to let him out, or your passing. Under a careful, albeit overbearing eye; this bubble will shelter him/her from evils such as ""swearing"", ""cursing""(theres a difference!) members of the opposite gender who haven't been preselected, ""friends"", ""self-identification"" and unwed-women over 30.Assuming this is your goal, you have the chance your child will be selected by cult who has brainwashing down to a science. If you are so lucky, these people will welcome your now aged ""child"" warmly and he'll finally be accepted by a group outside of your (very)immediate family."
5,As cool as a Bob! maybe even sleeker!,"Above I put 8 pictures and 8 captions for each pictures. They are my review for this beautiful stroller! My son usually does not like being in a stroller. But he has no problem going with this stroller that I can not believe. The stroller is so light that maneuvering is a breeze, folds pretty compact an no hassle with it, lots of compartment and a large basket, a wide window on top that you can see your kid, reclining seat that you kid can even sleep, comes with a rain/wind cover which fits and looks good, also the stroller looks so sleek and has a bright red color which is unique. In short, we love this stroller and highly recommend it."
5,Butterly Trinket Box,This is a very beautiful dainty little box. I was very happy with this purchase!
4,"Sweet ""Sisters Of Mercy""","This is an update to the previous review I wrote since I now own the Vagabonds, Kings, Warriors, Angels box set. The version of Sisters Of Mercy on the box set is indeed the one with all vocals and the sound quality is superior to the version in this set. This song alone should've broke the band out as it is simply awesome! I also noticed that released in January 2003 is the Grand Slam Live recordings from Mark Stanway but as of yet, I haven't heard anything from it so I can't comment on the sound quality. If I hear anything about it I'll post a review for it. Rock On!"
5,Best chair pad ever!,"I've been using this chair pad for nearly a month. I was pleasantly surprised at how we'll its made. I was a bit concerned after some of the other posts of how easily the chair mat could be scratched or damaged. I have an ergonomic Hayworth chair with hard wood casters on it and it rolls like a dream. I have this chair mat in my home office on top of one-inch thick carpet and carpet pad. You definitely need the 12mm thick version with thicker carpet and pad. Mine stays in place and does not move thanks to the grip material on the back of the chair mat. After the first month, I'm well pleased and would buy this product again if I needed one for another location."
4,Looks good and should last,After going thru the clear rubber chair mats at a rate of about 4-5/year I decided to try something different. The teak mat looks great and is holding up well -- only get minor grooves/tracks from the chairs. As the piece is solid wood these don't discolor and are barely noticeable. The only disappointment is the size of the lip. Its slightly shorter and narrower than the rubber mats and my chair occasionally rolls off -- not a bit deal . . .
2,Questionable evidence,"This author wrote a biography of Denys Finch Hatton in which she doesn't mention any relationship between Beryl Markham and Denys Finch Hatton. Now that Beryl Markham is conveniently dead, she claims there was such a relationship--but she doesn't quote Beryl Markham on the matter. She does give a source--one elderly woman--but this doesn't seem convincing.This book does bring up another side of the story from the previous biography of Markham (""Straight on Till Morning"" by Lovell). It seems to me unusual that Markham never wrote anything after her divorce from Raoul Schumacher, so I believe that she didn't write ""West With the Night.""This book is worth reading if you want information to construct your own theories as this author did."
2,Read Straight On Till Morning...,"Read the biography by Mary Lovell, Straight On Till Morning. Beryl Markham was a remarkable woman, albeit not really enculturated to her ""Britishness,"" due to upbringing etc...but this running with the boys and learning to hunt was the root of her disaffection with life in England, and probably the root of her relationships. She did what a lot of women ddn't even know one could. And no one taught us in school that she was the first woman to cross the Atlantic by plane...how judgemental is that?! A fascinating life all the way."
2,"I Should Have Stopped with ""West with the Night""","I am only a third of the way through this book, and am already deeply saddened by it's content. After reading ""West with the Night,"" I was anxious to know more about the mysterious Beryl Markham. How common that this book seems to concentrate on her alleged promiscuity rather than on her remarkable achievements for a woman during the 1920's. It reads more like a transcript from a British Jerry Springer episode. It's like going to an art gallery, and listening to some jealous wannabe fool babble on and on about the artist's ""intent"" or their ""mood"" during the creation of the piece of art; piecing together their indictment from hearsay. This book would be just grand for subscribers of People magazine."
2,Finding Beryl Markham,"After reading ""West with the Night"" I wanted to know who is this brilliant woman? The biography is hard to follow because events and persons are mixed in a weird cocktail. The author does not follow a clear story line, has perhaps just as little writing talent as she claims Beryl Markham did. Beryl's uninhibited life in Africa and Los Angeles is documented, but not much credit given to her remarkable talents this woman obviously possessed. Her third husband Raoul Schumacher, a Hollywood ghostwriter, is believably credited with the authorship of ""West with the Night"". He couldn't have written so well without the vivid recollections about horsebreeding, aviation and animal behavior in Africa by his wife Beryl Markham, whom he adored.This biography is a hodgepodge through which one most roam to come about facts. Like for instance what kind of monoplane did she fly from London to New York etc.? Was the year 1932?"
4,Did she or didn't she?,"Several writers have suggested what is really a sensible solution - Beryl was not an author in the traditional sense, she wrote about her life and experiences, so her efforts when trying to write commercially were plagued by her disinterest and lack of ability. She did write beautifully in West as well as those of her stories presented in the first section of Splendid Outcast, but if you compare them with ones at the end of the book, that the author suggests were probably written jointly with Rauol, the stylistic differences are clear. She was not a ""writer"" who could churn out material for publication, she could write about the things she knew and loved.As to being promiscious and occasionally ornery, she saw no reason to act any differently than men acted in her world, and good for her!"
4,The Whole Truth,"After visiting Africa, I found a fascination for the stories connectiong the British Colonists in Kenya in the early part of the 20th century. White Mischief, a marvelous, decedant mystery was a fun read and movie. I later discovered it was filmed at Giraffe Manor, where we had stayed in Nairobi. So, I thien read West With the Wind, a beautiful, limited account of Beryl. Many questions were unanswered: how could she live in the time of the Happy Valley crowd and now mention them? How could she not mention her mother or other women? And, was she ever married? Then, The Lives of Beryl Markham, excessively well documented, tells all: her willd, African upbringing, her three marriages, her flagrant promescuity, and her dislike of all women. It is very interesting IF you are into this subject. If not, it bogs down after her famous flight and is hard to finish. Almost a textbook. Of special interest: her liasons with the heirs to the British throne!"
5,Be prepared to take Markham for who she was.,Read this book with an open mind. Beryl Markham was not a typical heroine and you will not like everything you read about her. The author is a well-respected writer of British colonial topics and should not be heavily criticized simply by presenting Markham for who she was: a complicated individual.
5,inspiring,"Mark Klempner is a masterful storyteller. Although 'storyteller' may make you think of fiction, this story is not fiction. Mark has poignantly shared interviews with Dutch resisters and rescuers in a way that won't let you stop thinking about them. He asks big questions and gives important answers about learning from the righteous and from history."
4,The Heart Has Reasons: Purchased at Amazon.com,"The Heart Has Reasons is an amazing book. This is about people in the Netherlands who rescued Jews during the Holocaust. These people were all so brave, and still many of them didn't want recognition for what they did. It was also quite interesting watching the author wrestle with his own personal demons while researching and writing this book. The authors parents both lost much of their families to the Holocaust. The authors father and his immediate family were on the last boat out of Poland five days before World War II began. A very well researched book with lots of meaning and insight into why people would save others in trouble."
4,Cheer with the crowd- Go Fish and acappella rock!,"These guys don't simply ""sing acappella"". They enrich acappella. They give acappella an attitude! Acappella is no longer simply for die-hard acappella fans. Acappella is for everyone! Ever get tired of not being able to hear the words over the music? Well your frustrations can end right there! Sing along with Go Fish as they perform in concert some of their most popular songs and some of their non-gofish favorites. Let your CD player run till it stops; you won't want to miss the hidden track! Their all new ""Created For This"" has the power to really move the listener, and as it clearly states: ""..."". And that's just what Go Fish does."
2,not good enough,"Most of the reviews about this product are not good, and now I can feel it. The picture and the color of the dish is pretty but the quality of china is terrible. Too bad I bought another two sets of dinner plates and salad/desert plates. Churchill should pay more attention to their products."
1,Poor Delivery,"Why are companies allowed to advertise items they do not have? This item was ordered Feb 7, 2007 and supposely on hand. Now March 12, over a month later and it has not been shipped. This has happened to me quite often on Amazon, which is why I try to order someplace else."
3,"Okay, But Light Years Less Entertaining Than Flashman","Reviewers below have raved about this book, giving it five stars. And I might go up as high as four if I'd never read the Flashman series by George MacDonald Fraser. The Travers books (of which this is the second) are slavish homages/imitations of the Flashmans, and they're fun in their way, but nowhere near as informative/humorous/well-plotted as the Flashmans. (For the record, this one seems to be based on ""Flashman's Lady"" [protagonist rescues lady love from pirates] as the first Travers was based on ""Flashman and the Dragon"" [hero outwits Chinese royalty as war rages].)So: If you haven't read the Flashmans, do so before reading these. They'll provide you with some pleasure, but leave you pining for Sir Harry."
5,beautiful,"No other words to express this album,,,the artistry is superb. would recommend to anyone, this album makes me glad I am a music lover, it is inspiring"
5,Sweet Addiction,"I listen to it when I go to work, while at work, leave work, at home. I can't take the music off my head!!! My favorite tracks are Mi Morena, Remember When it Rained, and Per Te. Instead of getting lulled to sleep, this music is keeping me awake."
2,"See it Closer, Now I quit","Josh Groban's ""Closer"" CD was a disappointment. Although there are some newer material and tremendous songs such as ""My Confession"" and ""Per Te,"" we also get Groban's badly written ""Never Let Go."" I stopped buying CD's with one or two good songs a long time ago. They wind up being big disappointments, even with a CD burner. Maybe I'll catch it in a used CD store, cheaper."
2,Not Josh Groban's Best,"Josh Groban's first CD and first concert DVD were wonderful. The songs were perfectly suited to his voice and provided him an opportunity to show the full range. Now we have ""Closer"" where Groban wants to be a songwriter. I don't think he should. While he is without a doubt, blessed with a beautiful voice, he does not have true talent in writing his own songs. Others are way more professional. Per Te, My Confession, and Mi Morena are quite lovely, but the other songs are slightly depressing. Even the extra film clips show a dull and depressing background. ""Never Let Go"" is the worst."
1,Dull and Depressing,"Granted the man had a good voice (past tense is appropriate if you heard his latest concert DVD). But now Josh Groban wants to be a songwriter too! Yikes, who told him he could write?!? ""You Raise Me Up"" is just another version of ""To Where You Are."" Just another opportunity for Groban to use the tragedy of Sept 11 to sell more records. Grotesque. Yeah, it shows too in his concert because it's exactly what he uses it for. The song isn't good."
1,Josh Groban is transitioning......Into What??,"Oh good grief. This CD is depressing. Josh Groban had explosive success from the start and it didn't stop. So what does he do?? Change the way he sings, add wierd arrangements and write his own songs. The whole thing is dull and depressing. There are scenes of Groban being photographed on a dull overcast day and those shots get placed in the CD cover.What does that have to do with anything? Well it's a forecase of what you're about to hear. Depressing songs from Josh Groban. Don't listen to this CD if you're a bit down because you'll have a fast trip to the off ramp.Success has spoiled Josh Groban."
5,"Wonderful followup to Josh in Concert DVD, CD","My husband & I are totally mesmerized by Josh's wonderful voice and performance. We have purchased everything we can, so far and will continue to do so, as long as Josh continues to sing & record. We love CLOSER. It is different from the first CD & DVD, but is totally addictive, just like the first. Josh's voice, which is brillant, for someone of ANY age, is one of the pluses which will draw many different ages . He is so versatile in his songs and makes one enjoy listening to songs which are in a language,foreign to many, but has the ability and talent to make it seem totally non-essential to understand all the words, as songs are beautiful in another language anyway and only makes me wish I could speak more than English! Hopefully, his next CD will also include a DVD of his 2004 tour. Buy CLOSER, as it will become one of your favorite musical purchases!! JOSH, Please make Austin or Houston one of your stops during your 2004 tour!!"
5,Outstanding,"I listen to this CD at work, and I have played it for my co-workers who were not aware of this young man's talents. They are now all big fans of Josh Groban. The music is soothing, and his voice is unique and beautiful! Buy this CD!"
5,Josh Groban is AWESOME!!! :),"What an AMAZING voice!!! I absolutely loved his first CD and now this new CD, CLOSER is my #1. I am more than convinced that he's my all time favorite. His voice is so incredible and he sounds great in any language (Spanish, French, English and especially Italian)!!!I sure hope we continue to hear more from this rising talent."
3,Gameboy Color version,I was expecting much better color quality for this game and thought that I ordered the NES version. It will still be a part of my gaming collection.
4,Duck tales 2,the game is very diffcult but it is very good with new characters and much tougher levels then the first one.
1,BSA -BS30 Boresighter,Not very happy with the product did not fit like it was suppose to would not stay in place I returned the product.
4,bore sighter,"I like the bore sighter, have used them before, really like the case. easy to use even tho the bore spindle does slip I use some electrical electrical tape on he spindle to hold it snug it works for me"
4,BSA Bore Sight Kit,As described. Needed to bore sight my new 17 varmit rifle and needed the 0.177 bore rod as no laser units have 0.177. Shipping was fast and price was right.
2,IT SHOW'S A PICTURE OF A SCOPE. BUT IT DONT COME WITH THE SCOPE.,I COULD HAVE ORDERED THE SAME THING BUT CHEAPER. I ONLY DID IT CAUSE THEY PUT THE PICTURE OF THE SCOPE. THINKING YOU WOULD ALSO GET THE SCOPE.
4,worth the money,"A simply made but extremely effective kit. I was suprised at the quality and the cost. For a tinker of firearms like myself, it;s well worth the funds."
4,Great source of information,"Accurate and descriptive in all the terms, excellent source for interpreters and translators in the field. Will love to have in the electronic format."
2,"OK for a basic dictionary, not for Physicians or pro translators","This dictionary is OK for very, very basic usage, perhaps for a beginner medical interpreter or for front office personnel, but definitely not for healthcare pros. If you're a physician, nurse or EMT you are better served looking elsewhere. If you are a medical translator or professional interpreter, you can invest your money on a better book."
2,Misunderstanding caused by book description,This dictionary does not include any guide for pronunciation of English or Spanish words. A proper dictionary should include some phoenetic guide to the pronunciation. The review incorrectly implies this is included
4,"Caution, it's in German","This is an amazing book. But, I can't read it because it is printed in German. Tons and tons of great photo's though. Hold out until an english version comes out. And, every copy is not signed by Nina."
4,Conway Twitty - Rock N Roller,"We finally have an affordable Conway Twitty CD with most of his rock and roll hits. For those who know Conway as a country artist, this may not be for you. The only problem I have with this collection is the ommission of one of his greatest rock and roll songs - A Million Teardrops. It's still a must pick-up for lovers of '50's rockabilly."
1,Such a disappointment,"I was very excited when the CD came out, but I'm very disappointed now. The reason is it's missing the best tracks such as ""Camp music"" (Pilot, part 1), ""interrogation"", ""moth"", ""island exploration"", ""ending scores"", ""Monster"" sound -- all those best moments in the series. This CD isn't as nearly interesting as I thought it would be. They could've included some dialogues/skits, there were plenty of good ones to choose from. Therefore, one star."
4,What about the music on Hurley's headphones?,"Where can I find that? Not a score - but actual songs. I've been looking for them, or at least the credits so I can buy them. Any help??"
4,Good book set in World War Two Cornwall,"Maizie Blackare is a woman living in Cornwall, running the family hotel while her husband Sam is in the merchant navy. Christian Le Gall is stilling recovery wounds he recieved at Dunkirk. He decideds to travel to the Hotel Paris where he meets Maizie and dispite her being married these two lonely people fall in love.""Wild Strawberries"" by Emma Blair, is different to the location, but the story line is pretty much the same. As before Ms. Blair gives good the reader a good pace to the book that holds the reader interest. The characers and plot are interesting,wanting the reader find out what happens in the end. Overall ""Wild Strawberris is a good book that Ms. Blair fans or newcomers will want to read."
2,No One's Perfect,"I am a big Prong fan. I have been listening to this album off and on for the last few months. As much as I want to like it, I just don't dig it that much. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple songs that are really pretty good (Entrance of the Eclipse), but they are of no comparison to pretty much every other song they have ever recorded. If I am correct, this is another case of the lead singer being the only original member. If you are just getting into Prong, go for 'Cleansing' or 'Beg to Differ' or 'Rude Awakening'. Old fans that still haven't heard it, I recommend downloading a couple of songs before you drop 15 of your hard earned dollars."
4,Prong being born again,"Reminds of the good old Prong, very well done Tommy Victor !Everything is great, except the lack of heavy drums. The only thing I don't like completely. Therefore 4 stars. Else, everything's great. Love the songs.Go check em live !P.S.: I don't understand people writing blurry things like Prong being nu-metal. Apparently those people are part of the nu-metal generation (God, I hate this word nu-metal).On this record, the great quality of the underrated and genius PRONG shines again, good ""comeback""."
3,"Scorpio rises, but not quite all the way.","I was never the biggest Prong fan (they were a bit before my time), but I liked a few songs. I listened to some samples of this album, and thought it sounded pretty good, so I bought it yesterday while at Hastings. The newly low-tuned guitars churn out some crunching riffs, and there's some great grooves, but there are a few flaws, mainly the production. The vocals are way too loud, and a bit grating. I think that the record could have used a better mix job. The other problem is that the songs tend to blend into each other, and there are too many of them. Trim this album down to about 10-12 songs, and fix the production, and this album would be a monster. If you can overlook those flaws, and you're tired of the screamo/metalcore garbage out there today, pick up ""Scorpio Rising"", and see what it's like when a band doesn't get their sound from watching ""Headbanger's Ball"" religiously."
5,Prong returns full force with another cutting-edge album!,"""Scorpio Rising"" proves (once again) that Prong is a superior metal band. They are so cutting-edge and forward-thinking that you can actually gage a metal fan's taste and maturity by whether or not they listen to Prong. I am disappointed by the tiny label this great album had to be released on (the major labels should wake up, Prong are gods!). Locomotive music is so low budget that they actually got a couple of songs reversed on the track listing... Regardless, this is an excellent album. It's great for ""old-school"" metal lovers who remember when heavy meant HEAVY. I also hope that every 20 year old ""nu-metal"" fan out there picks up a copy of ""Scorpio Rising"" and all of Prong's back catalog. Listen and learn, people!"
3,Not pop music,"OK quality, just not what I expected. A bit to slow for our girls. Doesn't have that ""pop"" music sound that the girls like nowadays."
2,Too general,"I expected more in depth information from this book. The info presented here can be found on the internet for free. An actual quote from the book: ""Finding books on barbs and their relatives can be a problem, as you may need to collect an extensive library of general aquarium books to have a wide range of information"" I thought this book would have the extensive information I was looking for, but it didn't.The photography is quite good though, and I will enjoy looking at in the future. Too bad there isn't anything in it worth reading in the future."
5,Super backpack,"This backpack is very spacious. In fact, it's probably not the type of backpack you would want to use everyday. It's perfect for traveling or weekend trips.The metal clasps are very sturdy and are top quality. The elastic drawstring at the top of the bag makes it easy to keep the top closed, yet slip your hand in to grab something inside.Very durable, top quality. Most definitely work the price."
1,Can't be authentic Prada,"This is such VERY poor quality, it can't possibly be authentic Prada. Within the first month of use, the elastic closure stretched out and eventually broke. By the end of the school year many of the seams started ripping and one of the straps ripped out of the seam. How can I get a refund for this obvious fake? Prada wouldn't stand for this poor quality. The backpack I bought at Walmart lasted longer than this."
5,Funny graffiti is good medicine,Funny books like this can do wonders for people in need of a lift. I'm a nurse and I show it to a number of my patients who generally love it.
3,Good picture poor sound quality...,"The picture quality of this 19 is very good!!Picture controls-brightness-sharpness-Picture-Color-TINT-Contrast +-DNR-Color Temp: Normal, Cold, WarmThe sound on the other hand has problems...There is a buzzing noise!... you can only really change the balance levels or the speakers.It's an OK TV, that's why I gave it three Stars."
3,Where's the rear AV hookups?,"It's great to have front AV jacks for game machines, camcorders, etc but why delete the rear jacks commonly used for VCR and DVD hookups? The picture quality is extremely good, the sound is poor for side mounted speakers, and the remote has great features and works super. I can live with the poor quality speakers but the lack of rear AV jacks is more serious...I'm going to return it and pay afew dollars more for a better set!"
4,Pretty Good TV,"This TV has great picture, sound, and is inexpensive. If your look to buy a TV go with this one I shopped around at many differnet stores and this was the best one I found."
3,bad sound,"Bought this at a local store for ten dollars more than Amazon.com. Picture and everything else was fine, though speakers started to buzz, even at low levels. Just returned it."
4,An old game that is still fun,When I was little barley old enough to hold the classic gameboy I would play this game over and over; it was my dad's but when his eyes went bad he gave up handhelds. This game is fun even after nearly 20 years this game is still fun. The only issue I still have with it is you can't save.
4,pretty good for the price,"For the price its a very good knife, the only complaint I have is that the ""paracord"" handle isn't paracord but I just replaced that."
3,You get what you pay for,First of all its handle is not wrapped in paracord its wrapped in a cheap nylon string. Other than that its pretty much what you pay for a knock off knife thats ok for camping and some general use.
5,beautiful album,"This album showcases Zucchero's greatest quality, his beautiful voice. Here, he melds Mediteranean rythms with soul and creates beautifully melodious songs. Zucchero is an amazing talent and is much underappreciated in America, take it from artists such as Miles Davis, Eric clapton, Sting and Bono who have worked with him. This is a beautiful cd that anyone interested in his music should own."
4,good video,"its a good vid. show good riding and great crashes, if your into metal mulshia, srh, kottonmouth kings , its has a good soundtrack, wish it was longer but the bonus feat. are good."
4,Great buy,"The quality of these salad/dessert plates seems to be a bit inferior to the dinner plates that I bought from England, even though they are the same manufacturer, etc. I have no reservations about the price, though. With the 4-for-3 promotion, the price was very good."
2,del Monaco / Nelli / Merola 1950 concert,"Del Monaco sings a good deal of offbeat repertoire here, which will make it attractive for many, but truth to tell, he's in rather wooden voice, and he doesn't seem comfortable. Nelli is astonishingly awful. She's only 27 or so, and sound 60. She has very rough sledding throughout, and the coloratura in the VESPRI aria is laughably inept. Oh well...."
2,quirky device,"The unit sounds great. The large display shows the album names well.However, the button layout is Horrible. Pushing the volumn knob cycles through the equalizer options. The right knob is a 5-way joystick. It is impossible to press in the stick to pause the song without skipping to other songs.After 9 monthes of using it, the fluorescent display konked out. I'm glad to move on to other brands."
1,KDC Mp632U,"As with many others, my display went dark. The problem is the surface mount resistors on the mother board. I managed to fix it once, now it went again. Now my right channel and rear fade doesn't work. this unit is only 2 years old. I've read where other models similar to this are now having the same type issues. So, it's best to avoid the Kenwood excelon series, unless of course your real handy with a solder iron."
2,Alert: VHS version does not have the 2 bonus episodes,"At the time of this writing, the DVD version is hard to find for a decent price. I guess it is out of print? So rather than spend 30-plus dollars on a Very Good-conditioned copy of the DVD through one of Amazon's secondary sellers, I instead bought the VHS version in New condition for approximately eight bucks (I have a combination DVD/VHS player). The only problem is that, previously unbeknownst to me, the VHS version does not contain the two bonus episodes, ""There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown"" and ""Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown,"" that are included on the DVD version. The VHS version only has the main title, ""A Charlie Brown Valentine,"" and sadly that TV special is below average to average, at best."
1,Not the right item-FAIL,I was very disappointed to recieve a movie that I already own instead of this one that I ordered. Not a good thing.
3,EarthWorm Jim,"Try and get your way to throgh flying,shooting all the way to the end.Trasport through toilets and get chewed up by a dog its a fun game."
3,home alone 2,I found the game to be alot of fun a great a game to play on thoses boring sunday afternoons and the game is easy to beat
1,Home Alone 2,"I was excited to play this game because I realy liked the movies. This game was very hard to play, tough getting from level to level. I played maybe twice and then gave up because it was to complicated. I'm looking for this game on a different platform."
2,limited,"you should think of this as a toy welder, it has very limited use. A small arc welder with an infinite adjustment knob would be more useful and cheaper to run than this. There are many reasons why this item was discontinued by Campbell hausefeld and I just mentioned a few. The wire drive and tension adjustment isn't very strong so treat it gently."
5,Works For Me,"I needed a small welder that would run on 115 VAC. I saw the reconditioned welder on Amazon at a very good price, so I bought it. I have not been disappointed. It's no Hobart or Lincoln, but it fits the bill for me perfectly. I just do a little light welding, I don't think the machine would be up to production welding or heavyh daily use, but I could be wrong."
2,Just like a toy!,"Not at all what it says it is!They do not know how to pack it so I received one that was broken during shipping, they were very quick to send a new one, packed the same way although this one was in one piece. When I used it I was welding on 1/16"" metal and it did not stick at all, I was able to remove the weld using plyers. Tried again and finally got a few spots done, very sad performance."
4,campbell hausfeld,it arrived when it was suppose to was a xmas present for hubby - he has used it a lot lately on his rat rod project says it performs as it should easy to handle the only thing he said have to watch for is when putting on new spool make sure it is perfectly aligned or wont feed correctly over all though good welder for the price
3,Sport springs,"Great ride quality and handling. A 3"" drop spring would have been way better. however for what it is it works well."
3,"Cosco Ability Care Toilet Safety Frame, Silver",I am disappointed in the frame as it is not nearly as sturdy as I expected it to be. It wobbles when being used and is not what I wanted but I have to use it as I am having a knee replacement next week and have to have something.
3,Not worth a sit? Not true!,"If economy is your primary consideration, and you don't have balance issues, this frame is more than adequate. Following my second hip replacement I removed a standard toilet and ""booster"" seat and installed an ADA height toilet plus this frame. As I suspect is true of other frames of similar design, the arms are wobbly in a horizontal plane. But they are secure when putting weight on them when getting up or down, which is their primary function, and the conventional toilet seat is rock solid (unlike the booster seat which rocked from side to side). The arms adjust easily (without tools) to three widths on either side, a feature which contributes to the wobble. That the legs raise is important to me as I want to be able to clean the floor regularly. I would recommend this frame for hip or knee replacement patients but not for the elderly, nor for anyone with balance problems who might be inclined to lean to the side or put all their weight on one arm."
4,Curious George Mood Puzzle a hit,Gave this to my grandsons who are almost 2 1/2 years old. Great to teach words--they learned to say astronaut--and differences between happy and sad.
5,Still Witty a Generation Later,"I received this book one Christmas when I was a child in the 1960s, and thoroughly enjoyed the stories, anecdotes, wordplay, and other humorous items it contained. Now, some 40 years later, my fond memories prompted me to find a copy for my 10-year old daughter who shares (inherited?!) both my love of reading and my sometimes offbeat sense of humor. (my own copy was either lost or given away decades ago)My hunch was correct: she enjoys the book as much as I did--she's even taken it to school to share with her classmates. While this book may not be ideal for every juvenile reader, (some of its humor may be too wry for some to ""get"") I still recommend it for any bright or witty child."
5,It really works!,"I use this for my kids whenever they have colds. It really relieves them during nighttime and also helps them get well faster. The room smells so good also. You just have to make sure to use it in a small room because it's not as effective when it is in our room (bigger). Price comparison I don't know because we don't have the product here. Overall, I would recommend it for all ages."
5,"6x6, great price, great product","Product came direct from Amazon and was 6 x 6-packs. It was a great price compared to local stores and service was great. We love this product versus giving our child medecine. From infancy until now (18mths) whenever we see her starting to get a runny nose, we run the humidifier each night with these and it clears up in a few days. Maybe we are just lucky, be we beleive in it."
4,Product great - price here BAD,"The product is great, but don't buy it here (Allergy Be Gone). It is only a 6 pad box. I fell for the feedback that said it was 6 boxes - obviously too good to be true. Get them at Walmart for around $3 a box - NOT $8.99 + shipping. Even Target is only $5.50 a box. Due to restocking fee and return shipping...kept the product and learned my lesson."
4,Lots of cool Pictures inside,"This book doesn't really talk much about anything on Source or the people creating the game. It focuses mainly on the process of how different elements in the game came out. With lots of concept and rendered art, it's good to have it around for inspiration or just plain viewing. The book also gives some information on Half-Life 1 and Mods, though these sections still give lots of cool pictures and very little text in comparison."
5,Good Start,"I haven't fully read it for it isn't out yet, but from what I hear, this is going to be the biggest bang in history of games. Think about all the questions you've ever wanted to ask VALVe or, the questions others have asked VALVe but we the only reply we get is, ""You'll see when the game is released."" jammed into a single book. This is going to be a good seller along with the strategy guide. Good-Bye Doom 3, Hello Half-Life 2!"
4,The Usual Suspects for A Greatest Hits Package,"There is not much on this collection that is surprising, and in fact all of it has been available in several forms before except one track. And that one will be released on an album that is planned for an October 19th release. Most glaringly overlooked on this album is no inclusions from his latest album MAMOUNA. And when I was in the store it was labled ""AS SEEN ON TV"". Where did that come from? All in all, a great set if you are unfamiliar but die-hard fans probably own it all already or soon will."
3,Roxy Music Was NOT Just Bryan Ferry's Backing Group!,"Not the CD Roxy Music fans are looking for. Any CD called the Best Of Roxy Music should have Do The Strand, Mother Of Pearl, Song For Europe, and Editions Of You. Of course, this one does not. This is another record company which does not have a clue about their artists. Roxy Music was much more than Bryan Ferry's backing group and would be better served with their own anthology, not lumped together with Ferry. Also, the group deserves a boxed set. When you realize Weird Al, Nick Lowe, etc have boxed sets, it is a shame that there isn't one domestically available for Roxy. This CD is good in that it gives Roxy Music some attention."
5,One of My Favorite CD's,"This is an excellent CD. If you're contemplating the purchase, you will not be sorry you did so. The compilation is almost perfect with the exception that I am not terribly impressed with a few of the first songs. However, Avalon, More than This, etc. more than make up for that."
2,Time to separate Roxy Music from Ferry,"Another boring collection of one of the great bands of the 70s and its leader, that decided to give the world more of elevator music. The ""real"" Roxy Music, lived till 1978. Later, they were part of Ferrys new direction - softer, romantic, older, boring. My girlfriend bought that album but she can't listen to the early stuff of the band. I can puke while listening to what became of Ferry in the 80s and 90s, so both of us can't listen to all of it. Time to separate Roxy Music from Ferry."
2,Not for runners,"I've used this pak for about 6 weeks now and am very frustrated with it. The elastic strap increases the bounce which is the last thing a runner needs. A side effect of the bounce is that the pak becomes loose so, as a result, constant adjustments are needed as I run. It's constructed well and may be great for hikes and such but it's not for runners who want a bounce free run. My solution - I cut the strap off and replaced it with a non stretch strap. Now it works as good as my wife's pak - no problems."
4,Good running pack,I ran with this pack on both a 14 and 16 mile run. It was comfortable and didn't bounce too much. I had the water bottle full and put a cell phone and ID in the zippered pocket in case of an emergency. Most of the time I can put the water bottle back into it's pouch with only one hand. The first run I didn't use the goo flask. Instead I put a couple of packets of goo in the flask pouch. I realized the purpose of the goo flask on that run. It's so you don't have to dispose of trash on a run. Luckily I was running in my neighborhood and used a couple of trash cans left at the roadside. The second run I used the goo flask. Temps were at 30 degrees and the goo was tough getting out of the flask. I'm sure it won't be a problem in warmer temps though. Occasionally I'd hit the buckle while running and the belt would loosen up but no major issues. Overall it's a good product and I'll continue to use it for long runs.
2,Very long straps!,"I've been using this pack for over a year, and I use it begrudgingly because I need water on my long runs. But I always assumed all water packs will have some sort of bounce, but My Main Gripe are the straps!!My waist size is 28, and the straps are TOOO LONG, I have so much extra strap folding over its quite ridiculous. There isn't any way to make the extra strap flush against it. Its very annoying and it scratches my arms as I run.To minimize Bounce if you put it higher on your back, instead of your hips, it holds more flush against your back, and doesn't bounce as much. But I'd like to find a water pack that I can carry oh my hips instead of my lower back.oh and the bottle it comes with leaks."
4,Works well so far..,"I am training to run a 1/2 marathon and needed a way to carry more than a few ounces of water, some nutrition packets and keys and an ID. This is perfect. When I start out with the bottle full it moves some but not excessive. As the bottle gets emptied I don't notice it at all. I have not used the 5 ounce bottle yet, I just carry packets of Gel in the pocket. Belt is fully adjustable from big to small and is just a bit stretchy. I look forward to many more miles with this product.KBinOKC"
1,Returned it,"As soon as I opened it, I realized this was not the same quality as the Verizon package that carried the ""same"" items. The case was my main need and as other reviewers have stated here, it fit terribly, would not close completely, the openings did not line up with the parts of the phone (i.e., earpiece, antenna). We purchased the Verizon version of this 3-piece set for our sons at a special price of $20 each WITH the purchase of these phones. I'm kicking myself for not having purchased 3-piece sets for all four of us."
3,Case is garbage,"I managed to get the case on the phone, but the phone wouldn't close & the case kept pushing against the phone's record button. If you manage to get the case to close, you still have to content with that issue. The hands-free ear piece works fine. Haven't tried the cigarette lighter adapter yet."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"Very Disappointed. The case was flimsy and the ear piece did not have good reception. It's the law in DC; must use ear piece. The car charger probably would have worked, but I returned the kit."
2,Not the greatset!,"This CD has a few good songs, but most are either too slow to cheer to, or just aren't very good. I would recommend shopping around a little more before you buy!"
2,Ho Hum,"This was probably the most boring book I've ever read. The fact that it was also confusing and pretentious didn't help matters. Okay if you need a light read, but a huge disappointment."
1,Big yawn...,"It was more fantasy than fiction. Scott and Vanessa met and instantly fell in love and spent almost every day together from the moment they met - that is, until a conflict arose - which didn't happen until the book was 3/4 over.So many details were given about the couple's day to day lives earlier in the book that the ending seemed rushed. The author glossed over the wedding and the honeymoon. I expected a passionate wedding night from the couple since they made a big deal about saving sex for marriage. It was all a tease.It would have been more interesting if the story was about Scott and Monica since they had much more in common. They were both widowed with small children and were closer in age, and Monica was more mature than Vanessa, a 23 year old virgin. It was too cute for my taste. At least there were no grammatical errors!"
4,Romantic,"Fate was a cute and romantic story about two people trying to find true love. I really enjoyed watching Scott and Vanessa's love and attraction blossom for one another.Fate was a very easy read, but I did find myself getting caught up in the lives of the characters.This is a good book for those who want to read a light, fun, and romantic story about two people falling in love (regardless of their races being different)."
2,Boring,"Not very interesting, very predictable and boring. It is about an interracial couple and the entire book they decide if they should be together. I expected better because normally Pamela Leigh Starr's books are a lot more interesting. It was okay, but I recommend you save your money.-Pryncez"
4,In Black & White,"After noticing one another multiple times at different places, Scott and Vanessa acquiesce to the attraction pulling at them. They are like any other couple. They meet, they court, and they fall in love; consequently, these lovebirds have a big strike against them. Vanessa is an African-American woman and Scott is a Caucasian man. This interracial couple not only struggles with the given qualms of being in a relationship, but they also deal with the prejudices of society. To make matters worse, both of their families are very brazen and boisterous with their negative opinions about the interracial union.Fate is an amorous love story about two very different people who come together against unfavorable circumstances and impossible people. I enjoyed that Fate was more than a love story. Scott and Vanessa have a tumultuous courting, and Leigh-Starr does an excellent job of leading you through the novel by your emotions.Reviewed by KaTrina LoveThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
5,What' s Fate Got to Do with It?,Fate kept me reading from beginning to end. I couldn't figure how things would turn out. The theme of interracial romance was intriguing.The character development was good. The plot was good. A little less detail would have made the story even better.
2,For the writing style add a 1/2,So I just finished this book and was a little let down. The characters were in love so fast and I was still trying to catch up. While the show of love was nice it was also a little too happy/sappy. The drama of the story could have been avoided if the main female character communicated. I would cut her some slack since it was her 1st adult relationship and her young age but it didn't work for this story. I am an avid IR reader and this story could have really pulled me in but fell flat. If you want a lot of talking romance then give it a read as a used book(don't pay too much or this one). But if you need romance and lite sex then read Choices by Tammy Williams.
3,Only okay in my humble opinion.,Though I pretty much liked the book I didn't like the fact that the female lead was 'only' 23yrs old and a virgin of all things and that she and Scott (male lead) only kissed throughout the book with occasional rubbing until near the end of the book. And even when they finally made love it was summed up in a few sentences. Scott's rambunctious little girls got to me too and I felt it weighed the story down.What annoyed me was near the end when Vanessa (female lead) decided to call their upcoming wedding off because of what a co-worker of Scott's says to her and how hard Scott had to try and 'win' his lady love back.
1,Kiddie Story,"I thought this was adult fiction... it's more like a juvenile story instead. I was disappointed, I kept reading & hoping it would get better. Scott and his girls deserved much better.Scott is a great character, he falls in love and is determined to be with the woman he loves. Vanessa left a lot to be desired, she falls in love with Scott but she's weak and immature. One of her most pathethic scenes: She leaves Scott a ""Dear John"" letter in his mailbox, then pretends nothings wrong when he drives up after she's done her dirty work, yet rather than talking to him about her decision not marry him she tries to get him to have sex in his garage instead."
2,Lacked character depth,"I anxiously anticipated the release of this novel but was very disappointed. First of all the characters were brought together by an unbelievable number of ""chance meetings"". I did not get to know the characters as individuals before they were falling all over each other. This added to the child-like mentality I got as I was reading the book. Nothing seemed believable because it wasn't built up to. This novel featured an interracial romance which is good, but it was unbelievable because it seems to just try to make a social statement without letting the reader in on seeing Scott and Vanessa fall in love with each other. I got bored with the book as I was reading it. Also just released, ""Against the Wind"" by Gwynne Forster is a much better choice for an interracial romance novel. I felt I knew both characters intimately and their relationship was a natural progression."
4,HEARTWARMING LOVE STORY,"FATE, by Pamela Leigh Starr, thrives on the principle that real love conquers all, including racism and bigotry, for a biracial couple.Vanessa, a fun-loving, Black New Orleans teacher, just happens to almost literally crash into Scott, a widowed, White architect and father of two very young girls. At their first meeting, the invisible sparks fly and the emotional connection is made. They actually (and unintentionally) attend the same three separate functions on the same day, sealing in their minds that fate means for them to be together.This novel, FATE, has love, passion, patience, sadness, racism, anger, acceptance, and humor. Ms. Starr is able to convey all of those emotions extremely well. We find ourselves rooting for Vanessa and Scott.Yet as their love develops, so do the obstacles of other people's prejudice, some well-meaning and some not. There is a point when the relationship falters, but in the end, love really does conquer all."
4,Fate,This was a very good book. I like how the author work with each of the characters in the book. I feel that the author did a very good job. I would read another book from this author.
2,To me this book was....,"Boring, Boring, Boring. I agree that it was silly and childish. After reading a good book like I'll be your shelter by Giselle Carmichael, Fate just didn't hold my interest."
2,Silly story,I was very disappointed after reading the good reviews and buying the book. The story is childish and unrealistic. There was no real depth to the characters.
4,Very sweet and romantic story,Fate was a very sweet book. Things started moving pretty fast in this book but it was very sweet. Scott and Vanessa are truly made for one another...the ending was great.
2,Poorly written,"Ever read the instruction manual for a product from China which was obviously a bad translation from Chinese to English? You know the kind, where some of the sentences come out to nonsense? Two words for Rubin and Gold: proof readers. This has to be the most poorly written book I've ever read. If you can wade through all the errors, you might find a tidbit or two of useful ideas or motivation. I can't imagine how much they must have paid for their endorsements, or better yet, who would have risked their reputation by standing behind them. Perhaps these ""Ministers of Tea"" should stick to their hot drinks and leave the writing to those who understand English."
1,Meaningless self-important drivel,"If you're wondering why Ron Rubin's books have such high ratings from readers on this site, I can tell you why. He ""teaches"" a class at St. Louis University, and in that class, he requires his students to write a review about his ""books"" as an assignment. I happen to know this because, unfortunately, I wasted my time taking his class. Trust me, he's even more annoying in person than he is in his bad writing. Don't waste your time reading anything this guy writes. Just as I did, you'll wish you had that time (and money) back."
1,Wrong Product,"Although this AC adapter was supposed to work with my Fuji Finepix F10 camera, it did not. You can't fit a square plug into a round hole. The F10 has a round fitting for the proper adapter and this adapter had a rectangular plug. Had to send it back."
1,incomplete,I GUESS THE AC-5VX WORKS BUT YOU NEED A DC COUPLER TO GO WITH IT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW IT SO THAT YOU COULD ORDER BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. NOW I CAN'T FIND THE DC COUPLER ANYWHERE.
2,Learn ASP --- THE HARD WAY,"Learn ASP -- the hard way: by acting as editor for premier press.I bought this book because I am tired of the dummies/idiots/morons series' condescension, and found some solace in this book. However, the code is contradictory. The same line of code could be reprinted on three different pages and have three minor differences. Even the source included on the cd-rom is different than the book. To the ""absolute beginner"" these differences seem insignificant until you try to run the code and get only errors. I am learning ASP, but because I have to debug somebody else's code.There are two great lessons from this book: 1) minor differences in code are crucial, 2) find a book that knows that."
1,Unfocussed,"I reviewed this as a possible student textbook because of the examples. However the examples are insufficiently explained, and the games ! Gross !! The books structure is unclear, hopping around with other web-technologies. I would have preferred a clear ASP focus with programming examples in VBScript and in JavaScript. The book by Dr R. Mellor is clearly superior for this market segment."
5,Great Item,I was so happy when I finally found this DVD. I saw the original that aired on HBO is the early 80's. For so long I searched for a way to see this again as it was a fond memory of my younger days. Thanks to Amazon I found it.I watched it within minutes of receiving it in the mail and it brought back so many memories for me. I was thrilled to share this with my own daughters.
3,CAMELOT ON BROADWAY,"Richard Harris makes a splendid King Arthur. I saw Camelot as world premiere in Hamilton Canada and later in Boadway, with Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Robert Goulet, unbeatable as Lancelot, (voice and stage presence). Richard Coote was cast as an amusing King Pelinore, and Roddy Mcdowall as a hateful, spiteful Mordred; his singing of the 7 deadly virtues was a little gem. This 1982 version of the play was nice but missing the fire and presence of the original cast. By the way Richard Burton sings worse than Harris. I bought the 1982 dvd of the play,it is very good and those who have not seen the original, but that was in the very early sixties."
3,just for broadway buffs,"Beautiful close-ups which allow you to appreciate the fine performances of the whole cast. Richard Harris is remarkable.Lighting is warm as on the stage.However the grainy picture throughout diminishes the pleasure of watching, and the result is that you can love it only if you are a Broadway fan. Also complain the lack of subtitles. Might it have been edited better? After all it's one of the most important musicals and it deserved better care."
2,"honestly written, would appeal to teens","It is hard to like the author/main character of this book. But I have to admire her honesty in not honey coating her life. I didn't really care for the book, but I'm glad I read it, as it kept me from going to the movie. The trailers for this move show a feel good, chick flick, and that is not what the book portrays. I am tired of being dupped by Hollywood. Read it just for that reason."
4,A must read for everyone!,"I didn't know what to expect going into this book but once I started I couldn't put it down. I was astonished at Bev's behavior and they way she treated her son as well as herself. There were even many moments when I wanted to reach into the book and shake her silly. In the end I applauded her for who she became and what she overcame.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who has a teenager that thinks they know it all and there are very little consequences to having sex, doing drugs and thinking school is unimportant.I know my children will be reading this book on day w/my encouragement."
5,It's all about family,"Engrossing autobiography and quick read about a woman who grows up while raising her son. This well-written book is not only about the author's journey as a mother, but also about her maturing relationship with her strict Italian parents. Donofrio writes candidly about her teenage pregnancy and how it impacted her relationships and life goals (such as pursuing a college education). She does not shy away from her mistakes, recalling freely the impact that her self-indulgent hippie days had on her young son. Yet she allows readers to view her story through their own moral lenses. Interesting account of a rugged individual doing her best with the hand she was dealt."
1,Save Time--Watch the Movie!,"Like A_reader from Albuquerque, NM, I found that the movie was much better than the book. In fact, I bought the book based on some questions brought up by the movie. Besides the title, I found nothing remotely interesting about the book. It KILLS me that I wasted my time and my money on this book!"
3,Sweet Not Deep,"Let's face it, this isn't deep reading here. It's a feel good book. And though I liked the idea of the storyline: Single mother raising herself and her child, (particularly because I related to it)I was left wanting more. I don't feel the author submerged herself into this book. I think she stated facts and added humor to keep it from getting too mundane. But there is no real depth to it. She barely describes anything,and there is hardly visual stimulation in her writing.For instance, what does she look like? What does Jason look like? She touched on it slightly near the end, but as I said, she really never totally brought you into her world. Like her character and relationships, she keeps her reader at arms length. It's too bad, because it could've been a great book as opposed to just a good book."
2,Glad when it was over,The less said about Beverly Donofrio's book the better. Highlights: She writes well and it's a quick and easy read. Lowlights: It doesn't take long before you want to slap the girl/woman and tell her to stop wasting her life on deadbeat boys and drugs. I hung in there waiting for the moment of awakening. By the time it came the book was pretty much finished.
3,Riding in cars gets an average rating,"To be fair this book was very readable and I did get a couple of laughs or maybe just smiles, but how could anyone be so bad and still survive. I had planned on seeing the upcoming movie with my 16 year old daughter and now I'm worried she may think this really really bad girl behavior is cool. This girl was pretty bad even for the 60's. If you can read between the lines or maybe if you just want to see the bright side then you may enjoy this story. She was a stickler for writing details. The book is a mere 204 pages but probably could have been told in 100. I wouldn't say don't read it but don't say you weren't warned."
2,Expected better,"I agree with a previous reviewer. This book -- like many books these days -- could have used a few more drafts. I expected more from Beverly D'Onofrio ... and I really wanted to like this book. I grew up near D'Onofrio around the same time. So, I enjoyed reading about that time and place. But Ms. D'Onofrio could have gone deeper. She wrote about all her wildness, drinking, drug abuse. But what got her out of all that? Just going to college? Just growing up? I wanted more. Plus, I didn't think the writing was very good.I think part of the problem with a lot of books these days is that publishing houses don't have the staff they used to. So, writers really do not get edited like they used to. Books are being released when really they could use two or three (or more) drafts."
3,A rare occasion where the movie was better than the book..,"This only gets 3-stars because the back story from the movie was embedded in my head. If I had never seen the movie, this book would've come across completely flat. This is a rare instance where I would say that the movie is way, way better than the book; including all of the story plots that were changed for the movie.Not to mention, that Penguin books did a terrible job converting this book to an eBook edition. Spacing was mid-word ""im matterialy"", ""Si mone"", etc and every single time the word ""corner"" was in the book it was written as ""comer"". Every time.This would be a book I'd say isn't really worth reading if you've seen the movie (or even if you haven't). It only makes half-sense unless you have all the life and characters pumped in from the movie and who knows how much of that was made up to make the movie better?"
2,Make sure your child is familiar with all the classic stories first or this story will be lost on them...,"My young child didn't have a clue what this book was about. Beyond that, this story is just not my style. The troll in the book talks like this, "" You need a reality check, junior"" or ""I want my money you four-legged buttinskis"" or ""Just show me the money"". This book is quite a bit too contemporary in heart and style for my taste."
4,An excellent book to learn ABAP,"The explanation of the ABAP syntax and commands is good. Even if you are experienced in ABAP, I guess there's something in the book that you do not know and is worth a perusal. It would have been better if the author would have included BDC, Dynpros also."
1,Not happy with the book,"I've recently bought this book ""Teach Yourself ABAP/4 in 21 days"". I am not at all satisfied with book esp. with the sample programs given in the book. The present version available for ABAP is 4.7 where as the author has explained a very old version. I am not able to load the sample programs into my system given in the CD ROM which is supplied with the book.Overall an below average book."
2,Too primitive of a book.,May be suitable for someone with ABSOLUTELY no knowledge of what SAP/ABAP is all about. I was disappointed with the extremely low level of contents. The book was very poorly put together. Looks like it was meant for the authors to get rich quick.
3,Beginners be careful...,"What really annoyed me was that the book does not state that you need to be on a R/3 system to actually do any ABAP/4 coding exercises, although you can run the screen cams from the CD. However, any technical person will tell you nothing beats ""hands-on"" practice. Having said that, the book is a good starting point."
1,Misleading and unprofessional,"I bought the book since I am a beginner in ABAP. Completely disappointed.* The book is OLD and fails to mention the SAP version it deals with.*It does not explain ABAP actions but rather shows and tells. How can one learn from this. For example a ""logon client"" is described as ""... the number that the user types in the client field."" No mention of the significance of clients for security and different business needs.*On top of that, the CD with the book claims to be the best instrument in teaching and showing ABAP but it does work on any system later than 95 or NT.All in all a very poor book."
3,A good start with ABAP/4,"I've read a portuguese translated version. It's good for reporting and some dialog transactions, data dictionary, but lacks explanations about forms or sapscripting, or related details ABAP/4 programming such as jobs, transactions, screen painter, etc. If you are looking for reporting, and some dialogs this book is for you."
3,Comprehensive treatment of topics covered.,Whatever topics covered are treated exhaustively. But some very important topics not covered viz. 1. Interactive Reports 2. Logical Databases 3. Dialogue programming 4. Batch Data Communication 5. SAP Script The Data Dictionary is very well presented.
3,ABAP UNICODE COMPLIANT,I think that the practise codes in CD should be made unicode compliant. This will greatly help the beginners.
4,It ended too soon.,"This book is extremely well written and provides a good basic introduction to ABAP and the fundamental development tools in R/3. I was disappointed however to reach day 21 without creating any interactive screens and having no mention of creating batch inputs. If this were expanded to 42 days it would definetely get 5 stars. With this book, SAP Help, and the Gareth M. De Bruyn book Advanced ABAP Programming for SAP most of what I needed was available but sometimes a struggle to find."
1,No Plates/Illustrations in this printing.,The text of this work makes references to various illustrations/plates which have apparently slipped the attention of the publisher. This book is MISSING the corresponding pictures. Do not by this half-baked version from Indy Publishing. You can pick up the complete version printed by Dover for a fraction of the price. (paperback)
2,No illustrations for the hardback,Do not order the hardback version of this book. It does not contain the illustrations referenced in the book. The paperback has all the illustrations and it makes a big difference. I had to return the hardback and get the paperback version. The paperback version I would rate 4 stars because it teaches sound techniques to drawing.
1,Boring,I wouldn't give it a thing most boring book ever read don't buy it don't read it that all I have to say thank u for reading my comit have a nice day
1,not what I was looking for,i was looking for some how to draw books with more illustrations .. I did try to read some of it but it just didn't catch my attention.
1,Had to return the item,The copy that I received had no plates/diagrams although it had plenty of references to the plates/drawings that should have been there. I returned the book. A disappointing purchase. I gave 1 star because it is not possible to give no stars.
5,Opustango,"Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again."
1,KERRAP!,"Don't let these folks fool you. Most of the songs were performed better by the original artists. The production is cheesy. For instance, ""Burnin' Desire"" is an Elvis Brothers song -- much cooler when performed by them."
5,Kaplan Your The Man.. Boogie Woogie And Blues Piano Heaven!!!!!,"Downhome Instrumental Greasy Gutbucket Blues And Boogie Woogie Piano Played From The Heart Done Right... Backed By One of The Best Rhythm Sections On This Planet, Larry Taylor Upright Bass, Richard Innis Drums.. Also The Recording And Production Is Phenominal.... Grab This Gem While You Can As It Is Out Of Print... Very Highly Reccommened!!!!"
2,Not Heavy Duty At All,"I purchased this grill a month or so ago and just got to use it for the first time this past weekend. Let me say that ""heavy duty"" is not a good description for this grill. I read the reviews that said 3 large skillets were placed on the grill and it stood up to them, that is why I bought the grill. It did not stand up well for me with only one skillet. The grill bowed in the middle permanently and the legs pushed backward so far that I thought they were going to snap. I am very unhappy with this purchase and will be taking this out of our camping equipment and replacing with something that I can actually depend on for cooking. What a waste of 40.00.Texsport Heavy Duty Camp Large GrillVery disapointed."
2,This Product Did Not Work Out,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, and this product did not work out at all, he took it camping and said the paint comes off and gets on your food, so he was not able to grill steaks directly on the grill, plus he said it was flimsy."
4,Love this,"I love this camp grill and use it every time we camp, every other month for approx 9 meals a trip. I know that I gave it a 4 star rating but that is because the top is not as strong as I like for the heavy dutch ovens I often use. I put another grill on top to provide extra support and it works great. The metal frame that holds the grate is strong and holds the extra grill well. I recommend the large grill if you want to cook 2 or three things at once. It is tall enough to sit over a good size fire ring. When this one wears out, I will order another one."
3,flimsy,Was disappointed. From the reviews I read I was expecting something more sturdy. Flexes easily with the push of the hand. Considered returning it and ordering the more expensive one but than decided to get on with my life.
2,Mediocre,Not one of her best books. Did not hold my interest as much as her books usually do. I would not recommend this book to my friends.
3,not the most comfortable shoe ever...,"Ok, so it is a slip on, but it is not as comfortable as they make you think it is. Honestely, I've bought like 3 pair of shoes from amazon.com so far, and I'm not crazy about buying the 4th one. I think shoes are one of those things that you need to try them on first before you embark upon the adventure of just ordering by your shoe size. These shoes in particular are too uptight, know what I mean? They are flashy and all, but not comfortable enough to go the long haul. If someone is to ""put themselves in your shoes"", be corteous enough to offer them another pair that are not these."
2,"Nice looking nice, smaller than expected and seam comes apart","These shoes are looking fine but they are rather small and it is hard to get your feet in. Once your feet are in they feel nice. But, after a while the seam comes apart from the sole. This is because the shoes are rather small then normally. I would advise to buy a size bigger then usual to prevent the seam is coming apart."
2,"Shoes look cheap, maybe fake???","The shoes are pretty but like some buyer said they are tide,look cheap and the padding was missing, maybe because the were made in Dominican Republic, What!!!! yes Im from there and never know Kenneth Cole have some business here, are the shoes fake? I don't know!!!"
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"From the very moment i saw them the my first thougt was are they fake??? they seems to be fake leather, and the finishing of the shoes is sho poor, they dont worth even 20 , i pay 92 us i will sent them back"
1,Intimane Questions??????? Not hardly,"This, without question, is one of the dumbest books I have ever had the agony to read. It ""offers"" '459 ways to bring you closer' as the sub title. Somehow-I just do not think ""What is your favorite color"" qualifies as a 'closeness' enhancment line of query.Reading through it was quite annoying-the questions reminded me of a list of what NOT to ask if one wanted to know anything ""real"" about another person. To say I was disapointed is putting it mildly. Frankly I felt as if I had completly squandered the cost of the book and the shipping.If you really need help to think up questions such as ""What is your favorite number"" or ""are you a picky eater"" then by all means buy the book. Otherwise--depend on your own good sense and abilities to come up with the questions to which you really want answers."
4,The Southern gentleman keeps rockin'.,Sonny James music is sure to please as the mixture is mainly country rock. A good album for the collection.
1,Defective right out of the box,"I plugged it into my presario and it took a moment to power up the computer. That concerned me a bit. When I moved the laptop with the cord connected, the connection instantly was lost and I couldn't get it to power up the computer again. Less than desirable product, I would say."
5,Muy Buen Servicio,"Bueno, pues el servicio de estos amigos, me parece muy bueno, espero que sigan asi!!Felicictaciones!!"
2,Adapter,Not as good as i thought and the end is just as flimsy as any other piece of garbage. I thought the power supply addapter would not have an adapter piece for it. Just means that this was just a cheaper knock off. Happy but not that happy about it.
1,Hi-Capacity COMPAQ Presario 2108US AC Adapter,"The adapter which was sent cannot be connected to my Compaq Presario M2108US notebook - it has the wrong plug at the computer end.The product is unusable and I will have to return it.It would be helpful if Amazon was to show photos of the plugs in the catalogue, with principal dimensions."
4,Great part of the series.,"I just finished reading Making the saint and let me say i loved it. Once again we find Kate, Cooper, and Annie on there never ending journey on the Wiccan path. I really enjoyed how Isobel told more about the other pagan religions. I had no idea there was a religion called Santira. I also found the religion to be very intresting. Out of the whole series i think this one is my favorite but then again i havent read the whole series. I think that all of the books that ive read in the series have been wonderful and well written. I was a little depressed to realize that i only have 5 books left in the series. Isobel, when ru gonna give us some more books. Well i cant wait to read the next book IN THE HOUSE OF WINTER. Also i think the covers of the book become so much more beautiful as the series go on. I can't wait to see what else Isobel has in store for the girls. Till next time."
3,"Nice, not great","nice collection but as it says, it shows just moments, if you already have the 100 best fights collection then here is nothing you havent see"
2,dont buy this,"watching this now. allot of talk, very brief clips of the fights. not much in the way of replays and slow mo's. would not recommend at all. more like an MTV commercial than anything else."
1,Not my taste in combat,There are legions of fans who lap up this action; some even pay 30 to 60 dollars per four hour special to see it on closed circuit. I just had to see what all the fuss was about. It is disturbing to see harm done to opponents without the historic stature of boxing or the grace and balance of the classical martial arts. This is just a slogging contest with the last one standing the winner.
5,THis Game Is AMazing!!!!!,"This is umbelievable. It's 2007 and this is still one of my favorite games. That goes to show that graphics arent everything and gameplay is the thing that matters. Nintendo, I love you."
5,The best Mario Game ever,"Super Mario Land 2 is awesome! There are many fun levels and power ups. You can save 3 game files on one game cartridge! I fully recommend this game to anyone that owns a Gameboy, Gameboy Pocket, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, or Gameboy Advance SP."
3,Not my favorite game,"Game came in high quality,but it wasn't my favorite. I don't play this game much. I prefer other classics like Warioland, Mario Tennis or Mortal Kombat"
5,Still rocks after all these years,"I picked this up as I started to collect old games which I used to play in my childhood. It is still the best Mario platformer game I have played on a console, the graphics are really nice for a game made in the 90s, was one of the best looking games on the Game Boy, music is catchy and saves your progress automatically which is very good for a game of its length. If you've never played this I'd say it's the handheld version of the SNES Super Mario World but without Yoshi.This is a must have for old-school game boy collectors."
3,fguhguhug,This is a nice game. Its grapicsyou can get it cheap.loui hbbgyubyu hbbhuibjhuj ubnhjnjhbnuybg uhuhnion nijninbubn hbninoinn j njuinyvbyyb hjhnuin huhjjin hjbgh luhjioun
4,This Game Rocks,"I have had this game for 4 years and I still like it.This game lets you store 3 different games! It's really fun and there are more than 25 full levels! Mario can put on bunny ears and slowly descend to the ground, he can have flower power and there are the classical gowing mushrooms. There are very unique enemy's, and I like the ability to save the number of lives that you have. You can play this game over and over. It is not to hard and it is not to easy, it is just the perfect diffuculty."
1,What?,"Whoever thought it was a bright idea to sell this game for an absurd amount is not thinking too clearly. I would never pay this much for one of those classic, but still very common games. I will go to a pawn shop or something, and I would hope anyone else wanting to purchase this little fun game would do the same. That is outrageous."
4,Woohoo,"This game is a definite step up from the first Super Mario Land. There's a lot of levels contained within six separate worlds, and the nice thing about this game is that it comes with a save feature, so you can explore the worlds and levels at your leisure and put down/pick up this game any time you like.Tatanga - the final boss/adversary from Super Mario Land - makes his appearance in here as the boss of the Space Zone, but the bad guy of the whole game is Wario, Mario's evil doppelganger. Weird, I know. But believe me, this is a good and enjoyable game, and a worthy installment in the collection of Mario games."
4,one of the top games,"when i first got the game i started playing it and couldnt put it down.......i always took my older brothers gameboy so i could play it....i still play it all the time on my gba but i would suggest this game to anyone who wants a challenge or wants to play something adventurous and exciting. If you buy this but think is a bit hard then look it up for cheats, there is an easy mode."
1,Here we go again!,"Once again, the History Channel is gathering together different past programs and trying to pass them off as something new! They have become masters at fleecing people if you don't pay attention. For instance, there is absolutely NOTHING about Lincoln in the program Sherman's March (I know because I already have it). So why is it included here???? Buyer beware!"
5,what a marvellous human being !,"my wife and i loved this set of dvd's all of it was extremely well done and kept us entertained for about 8 or more hours, i would highly recommend this for anyone who loves history, regards ian and melinda healy."
1,Worst Characterizations of Lincoln I've Ever Seen!,In my opinion this DVD was made up by extreme liberals (politically) and they try to make America's First Republican President look like he was a godless man with almost no redeeming values. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone!
3,Atomic Physics: An Exploration through problems and solutions,I received the text on time and in good shape. I am involved in a research project and I wanted more insight on this topic. This is why I bought this book.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The first thing that the potential buyer should know is although De Rerum Natura is a poem, this translation doesn't even attempt to be poetic but simply translates everything as prose. On the other hand, this choice may aid readers who are trying to follow along in Latin as a poetic translation would have to be less faithful.Secondly, the translator seems to be trying to weaken Lucretius' arguments deliberately -- for instance, a major theme of the first book is a rebuttal of the tired assertion that religion leads to morality-- but the translator always uses ""superstition"" as a translation for the Latin word ""religio"". While it is true that ""religio"" can also mean ""superstition"", it is clear from the context that Lucretius was criticizing mainstream supernatural beliefs -- in other words religion -- rather than oddball beliefs that are termed superstition."
1,Book description wrong,"This is NOT the Loeb classics edition - with Smith's 1976 revised English translation facing the Latin text. It is Cyril Bailey's 1910 translation - and clearly a xeroxed version - delivered one paragraph or less per page. At least that's what I got when they sent me a ""sample"". I hope someone at Amazon will take note of this fact and correct the description, which seems to be the text of the first review."
1,The Kindle edition is not the parallel text,"I returned this purchase to Amazon, The Kindle edition is NOT the parallel Latin English, is a sort of PDF with pictures of the text, as far as I know this is unique in Kindle editions, you can not change the font or make highlights. It is the English text only, and I wanted the original Latin.The work The Rerum Natura is very good, and I am going to purchase the book, If you are interested first try the sample.I now have the small hard cover LOEB with the Latin original. Pity it is not available for Kindle, the LOEB Classical Library, red cover Latin, Green Classical Greek should be on Kindle."
3,"An Interesting Book, Although Not Well Organized","Given the title--""Leaves of Truth: Utah and the Mormons"" (1909)--you would expect John Phillips Meakin to be Mormon. Interestingly enough, he's not. Indeed, Meakin's ""testimony"" of Mormonism is so powerful that one wonders why he didn't join the Church. It seems his mission was to fight the vicious stereotypes of nineteenth-century anti-Mormonism; many of the chapters of this book come from speeches he gave around the country on the subject of Mormonism. He seems intent on playing the part of the non-Mormon who alerts those outside Utah that Mormons, in fact, are human beings, not the hideous stereotype so often found in anti-Mormon literature.The book is poorly written (often painfully so), but it is wholly sincere. It is also disjointed, being a collection of speeches, anecdotes, poems (the kind read over the pulpit on Sunday--i.e., bad poems), travelogues, etc. The book's power lies simply in its being a testimony for Mormonism by an outsider."
2,BORING,"This book is not erotica. Danelle Harmon and Lisa Kleypas (main-stream romance writers) write more graphic erotic loves scenes than this book . The book is well-written, so I won't give it one star. I don't recommend this book if you are looking for something sexy. Actually, I don't recommend this book at all. It was depressing and filled with lots of unpleasant characters. Just pass this one up."
1,Handle broke off after a few months,"I'll start by saying that until this point, I was a big T-Fal fan.I ordered my set of 2 pans in November 07. When I got them, they did not look like the picture on Amazon. I contacted T-Fal about this and they said the picture does not always look like the product.OK - I was fine with that. I didn't get the Thermo-Spot thing, but that's ok. Next thing I noticed is that the handles on both pans started to feel loose. I contacted the company about it. They said this sometimes happens but not to worry.Finally, I was rinsing out one of the pans the other day and the handle completely fell off. This is ridiculous! That could have been very dangerous. I tried getting in touch with T-Fal and no luck so far. I will keep trying.Don't buy these pans!"
5,Easy For Cooking and Cleaning!,"I am very pleased with this product. They are well balanced pans and don't slide on the burner and nothing sticks, not even eggs without oil! Heat is evenly distrubuted. Clean up is a breeze."
5,T-Fal Fry Pans,"T-Fal Nonstick Sauté Pan Combo - 8""/10""These T-Fal fry pans may not get the best rap on reviews, however; given only reasonable care this 2 pan set has served hundreds of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners at my bread and breakfast diner and only show minor discoloration.Nylon tools are used exclusively along with nylon 'scrubbies' for the heavy stuff. A little care goes a long way!I can still slide a fried egg in eithor pan after all this use.You can't beat the great price eithor!"
2,Omelette Lovers and Frying Pan Chefs Beware - 1 year post,"If you use T-fal non-stick pans every day, they won't last you more than a year. I've never used anything to clean it but a soft-bristle brush with soap and hot water. It has never gone in the dishwasher.The non-stick surface has just been etching away and I've been starting to see black specs in my omelettes. Needless to say, I just tossed it out. Stick with calphalon if you're serious about your frying pans and/or omelettes."
1,Industeral Greed,"It's a shame on T-Fal to put their name on a flimsy, cheap and lousy product like this. I had a better opinion about their responsibility for quality. Unfortunately, many companies like T-Fal are blinded with profit. Buy cheap -from china- and sell high; Shortsighted strategy at expense of their brand name.This saute set (in usage and maintenance) resemble a cooking ware bought at the 1 dollar stores.The frying pan is too light, wrong shape, flat and burn food easily; also nonstick coat scratches at touch!!"
1,misrepresentation,"I ordered these pans as shown in the picture and when i received them the pans had NO RED HEAT DOTS on them,I returned them and reordered them with the help of an Amazon Rep. and received the same pans with no red heat dots,I Canceled my order"
5,pans are worth the money,I would highly reccommend this product very easy to clean and I love the preheat circle in the middle
3,"Good content, jumbled delivery.","I liked the book because I enjoyed reading about the players involved. It would have been a better read had the author not ""bounced"" around on the time-line so much, & left a few cliche's out."
2,Interesting subject diminished by mediocre delivery,"Reads like a high school term paper written on the last day of Christmas vacation, an overdose of encyclopedia trivia and lots of cliches stretched to fill the requisite number of pages. How can so many media deals be discussed without any analysis of Herb Allen's role? Is Dr. Malone's only redeeming quality his love for his wife? Many of the people who sit in the ""glowing circle of his electric hearth"" knocked on his door. Bankruptcy BAD, Malone NOT SO BAD? Was Shaquille O'Neal's skin hue really the only example of digital compression's color problem that Davis could find? Surely some inanimate object that could be more appropriately described as ""black"" appeared green when telecast via digital."
2,Not a new update!,"I have been a Calendar Creator user for several years. Love the product. However, I am very disappointed with 2005 Deluxe. Every few years I update the software to the latest version. THIS IS NOT AN UPDATE! It is the same product they have been selling since 2002 with a new label. Don't let the ""2005"" label fool you. Personally, I feel cheated by the company because they are passing this off as a new update by relabeling a three year old product."
4,Inspiring new gospel duo for today's young adults,"I have just listened to the new cd, ""Haven't You Decided Yet"", by the new, up and coming gospel duo, Williams & Collins, and I must say that I was very moved and inspired by the lyrics on this cd. I was very impressed with the focus of the songs and how they relate to the young adults, although it makes for good listening for all age groups. With the right exposure, I feel this new duo will touch and uplift many people, young and old. I want to wish them the very best and much success in their endeavor to spread the word of God where it is much needed during these trying times. I hope a major recording label will give them the opportunity they so richly deserve and get them exposed to the public to touch and enrich as many lives with their positive messages as soon as possible."
2,Jack Starr,"I was excited when I found out the lead singer is the guy who sang for ""Picture"" years ago. The guitar work is okay at best and the production is awful. This might have sounded good 25 years ago on my turntable but now sounds stale and flat.I think they intended it to be that way to take you back to the begining days of metal but it doesn't work against what's out there now. Similar to old Rainbow, Malmsteen,or Dio in song style."
2,Oy...,"I just couldn't get into this book. The Kid's mannerisms were (ignoring the anachronisms) too over-the-top and caricaturish even for a heterosexual like me. I have a feeling some of Marvel's gay readers were alienated by this. Beyond the embarassing and pointless depiction of the Kid, most of the attempts at humor fall flat (""Mayor Bush"", anyone?) Plus, the introduction mentions the Kid's background in the original books, and proceeds to ignore it later in the story. Mainly, I have to ask why they chose this particular character to ""out"". Still, John Severin's art is pretty good, and for that alone I'll give this book two stars."
2,"Not durable, lasted less than two years.",The blue nozzle is clogged and the built in nozzle cleaner cannot fix it. This kind of printer's nozzle is not easily fixable either.
1,Very Poor Printer,"I purchased this printer 3 months ago and it has been a terrible disappointment. There is no single sheet feeder. When feeding envelopes, they get jammed most of the time. The paper feeding from either tray pulls more than one page thru. I will be going back to HP...."
1,Brother 6490 Sucks,"I've had no luck connecting this printer wirelessly. Oh yeah, I got it to work once! Then for no reason it would not connect. I spent several days trying to troubleshoot both on my own and with tech support. Finally bought ethernet cable and it STILL WOULDNT WORK. Turns out the machine had to be totally replaced.It's only been 4 months and I've wasted hundreds of dollars of my time trying to get the machine to do basic printing from our computers.YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.DON'T PAY A PENNY FOR THIS MACHINE. It really costs hundreds of dollars in wasted time!"
1,"go with ""Cut Me While I'm Hot""","If you've read Mac's book then you may know that the songs that make up this cd (and many others like it eg: Trader John, Loser For You Baby, Zu Zu Man, etc.) were either sold for quick money or stolen from the Dr. I haven't heard this one yet but having owned the others like it, I suggest you go with ""Cut Me While I'm Hot"" if you want the best mixes of these songs."
4,bike seat,"Difficult to put together with just one person, though not impossible. Seems better for a child under 3 feet tall, though my daughter and I are making do. She loves it!"
3,Not recommended for mountain bikes with large frames,This seat looks nice and I assume after you get it on the bike it would be nice but the bolts that hold the top and bottom to the frame are too small and its not nice to find that out after you spend 1 hour putting it all together. Had to go to the local hardware store for longer bolts. Personally I wanted to just take it back but the wife wanted to make it work. Be warned!
1,Worst item I ever bought online,I am an avid online shopper and have never had any problmes until now. I can't believe how bad the Fisher Price 1-2-3 Carrier is. When it came there were no instruction for assembly. Parts are missing and pieces (nuts and bolts) were strewn about the box. The advertisement is false. It says for ages 3-7 but now where in the ad for it is there a weight limit. After fighting to get it put together I find on the side of the seat a sticker that says 40lb limit. How many 7yo's weigh less then 40lbs? I will never recommond anything from toysrus.com or amazon online to anyone nor willl I buy from them online ever again. I will also be returning the item for a full refund!
1,Nightmare,"We bought this for our 2 year old daughter. It was a nightmare to put together, then it did not fit. Becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes. We bought a 20inch frame, men's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting. Not worth it!!!"
1,Bought and Returned It,"I had no problems with the instructions, but once put together, it didn't fit my bike. The box does claim it fits ""most"" bikes, but honestly, the brackets that attach to the rear frame are so close together it's a wonder it fits ANY bike. My wife and I had to pull the bracket apart to get it on the frame, thereby strectching it almost to the point of breaking it. I took it all apart and diuble-checked the installation. Same thing. Also - The bolt tops and nuts protrude from the brackets enough where it would be easy for a child to get scrapped or cut. Bolt heads should set in the brackets to create a flat surface. Going to look for something else."
1,Taking it back.,"This seat was tough to put together, and didn't fit my mountain bike. I am taking it back."
1,40 pound limit!,The Amazon description of this product is inconsistent with the manufacturer's information. The Amazon description suggests the product for ages 3-7 yet the product instructions are specific about the weight limit: 40 pounds. Most children are close to 40 pounds by age four.
2,"hard to fit, hard to handle","the fact that the support struts bolted to the seat through plastic, which stripped allowing the bolts to slip was troubling. when we couldn't get the bottom supports to fit our mountain bike's rear frame supports, we packed it back up for return. i do not reccomend this product for mountain bikes, it may fit lighter road bikes, but the connections to the bike do not look durable or well designed... i don't think they would take a lot of vibrating."
2,Nordic Track Mountain Bike incompatibility,"This seat seems to be the one to get for durability and ease of mounting and dismounting. But I only gave it 3 stars in the ""fun"" category because my bike won't accept the lower support arms. 1) the metal supports seem flat or not bent enough to get around my tire and spokes; 2) My Dual suspension bike has thicker rear wheel supports which don't allow the brackets to be fastened and 3) the same was true for the seat bracket. Solution: if you have a high $$$ mountain bike be careful selecting this carrier. Fisher Price should tell you the MAX DIAMETER those brackets will fit around under the seat and around the rear tire. This is the kind of INFO you want to have BEFORE you buy it and open the box. I probably will return this purchase. :-( Good Luck."
1,3 to 7 your kidding aren't you!,I found the size range to be completely missleading. My child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs. She is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat. Her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable. The bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be?
1,"Not user friendly, hard to assemble","I wouldn't recommend this bike seat for anyone, in fact we are returning ours. It is extremely hard to put together and we can't even get it on our bike - we're going to return this and get a better one."
2,Not compatible with my Mountain Bike,"Although the box claims that this carrier works with ""most road and mountain bikes"" I doubt the validity of the claim since it didn't work with my Trek mountain bike and another poster had a similar problem with the connection to the rear frame supports. Of course, I didn't get to learn this until I was about 70% through the the assembly. If you have a standard road bike (think Schwinn 10-speed) this seat will likely fit. Although there are many parts, I did think the assembly instructions were pretty clearly written - they worked hard to make sure you knew what tools were needed and provide accurate descriptions to identify the parts. FP would do customers, and themselves, a favor if they included a max diameter measurement for the rear frame support on the OUTSIDE of the box. I've returned the seat due to the incompatibility."
1,A waste of my time,"The package was missing pieces (paint guards), and had an extra one (strap to hold the carrier to the bike) not listed in the instructions. Either the seat or the supports were manufactured or designed incorrectly, so I couldn't get it mounted to my bike. I took it back. This carrier is manufactured by Bell, and the ones sold under that name don't go together any easier."
4,it cool,wish i could save game but other than that it awesome of course it is hard some but sweet i say buy cheap just incase you dont like
3,Simple Short Time Filler,Since the game came out early in the gameboy's life cycle it is no surprise at how simple the overall gameplay can be. Basically its the usual sidescrolling beat 'em up. Which is not a bad thing if maybe it had a few more levels. With only five you can easily blow through it in thirty minutes. On the positive though the game does not look bad the controls are responsive and the music is as good as you would expect from the original gameboy. Overall it is best left for fans of the material and that is who can appreciate it the most.
3,TURTLE POWER!,"THE FALL OF THE FOOT CLAN, IS NOT A BAD GAME AT ALL. BUT WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO SKIP TO ANY LEVEL YOU WANT FROM THE BEGINING. I THINK THAT S****. BUT OVERALL IT'S A FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH NICE GRAPHICS. IT CAN ALSO BE AN EASY GAME TO BEAT AS WELL. YOUR BEST BET IS TO GET ANOTHER GAME MORE LONGER. BUT IF YA INTO QUICK GAMES, WELL THIS GAME WILL BE FOR YOU TO CHOOSE. IT'S NOT A BORING GAME. IT'S A COOL GAME TO PLAY."
3,Gladstonian in length,"This book has the merit of being well-written despite the occasional lapse into the tedious. It makes excellent bed-time reading, a long-term read , and I take a dollop of it before 'schlafen' as one would a pleasant sedative"
2,"Brian Wells, Esquire, Reviews ""Gladstone"" by Roy Jenkins","The book, ""Gladstone"" by Roy Jenkins is an extremely hard read because of the author's assumption that the reader already possessed a wide knowlege of British History. This reader who has an undergraduate degree with a History minor was was required to read this book in conjuction with ""Queen Victoria"" by Elizabeth Longford and ""Disreali"" by Robert Blake as well as make frequent trips to the Encyclopedia Britannica in order to understand what was going on in the book and to follow all the names that were dropped in the text without explanation.Furthermore, the author's habit of drawing comparisons of the events within Gladsone's life with events from both much earlier times and much later times did not clarify the story he was trying to tell and indeed had the effect of further confusing the reader."
4,An excellent yoyo,The Yomega Fireball is a good yoyo and can do a long sleeper. It is also pretty good for string tricks. It is also very good at around the world and walk the dog.p.s. if you do not like this yoyo try the Yomega Power Brain it's great for beginners because of it's centrifugal clutch.
4,Yomegas are among the best,This is my favorite transaxel yoyo. Yomega is a very good brand. My sister was a local rep for them for a while.
4,Amazing in color,"It was a delight to see this childhood memory again, and in pristine quality with color (if you prefer it in original black & white, turn the color down on your tv set). It brings this 60s series to a whole new generation of fans (my nephews & nieces wouldn't watch it in b&w)."
5,I Dream of Jeannie,"Great/ Good TV Show. I just Love the Look of Barbera Eden.About a Magical Jeannie, That can grant Any wish, If your Her Master."
1,Damaged Product,"I bought this DVD Season for a Christmas gift. When I bought it, it said it was brand new. Unfortunetly all the discs were deeply scratched!!. I wasn't to happy with this purchase."
3,The First Season...in horrible color!,"The first season of I Dream of Jeannie was probably either the worst or second worst. The big trouble with this season is that Roger didn't know about Jeannie until halfway through the season. Without Roger, the episodes are serious and not that humorous.The color version is god-awful! Some episodes are watchable, while others are simply awful. The flesh tones are exagerated. Look at the horrible color of Major Nelson's house. It also reveals oddities not shown in black and white. Check out the view from Major Nelson's balcony. It's so...FAKE! Obviously a painting in color, but not so in black and white.Call me picky, but is anyone irked that there is some extra text in the opening theme title card. It says 2000 CPT Holdings. My advice is to get the Black and White version."
5,The Best!,"I use to watch this show whenever it appeared on TV! I found this item on amazon and was so happy that I had to get it. Now, I'm glad I got it! Great show in good condition!"
5,Jeannie is still a Dream,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter who had only seen it occasionally on TV. Having watched the original episodes as a kid, it's always nice to see a classic in sequence from the beginning. The pilot is terrific and must have knocked the socks off the 1960s network execs. Barbara Eden is beautiful and the story a fantasy of every man. But it's clean and simply fun. You can tell the cast enjoyed going to work. Clearly, they were having a great time."
5,Finally! Jeannie DVDs escape there bottle!,"Yay! (...) The reason that there are 2 listings for this set on amazon is that it will be avialable in both black and white and color (like Bewitched). Extras will include audio commentaries from Barbara Eden, Larry Hagman and Bill Daily! There will also be a featurette in which they will be interviewd! Can't wait!"
5,"""Master""ful job by Sony!","Received IDOJ(in color),yeah i know,colorized!I say (in color)because you will find it virtually impossible to tell that thisset was ""colorized"" and not filmed in color.Fans,the process ofcolorization used on this dvd release is superb!This is not 1980colorization,not by long shot,vivid,vibrant,brilliant life-likecolor.I'm from the 'ole love black and white days,but my familywanted color,so we compromised.Got the color version for them &i just turn the color off the t.v. for me,looks great,works wellall happy - and the colorized version was so well done,as statedbetter off going with it,you wont be sorry.The show is funny,silly, all in good fun as i remember it and Barbara Eden stillmust go down as one of the prettiest,sexiest woman to everappear on any screen.Jeannieeeeeeeeeeee!"
1,I Dream Of Jeannie,I opened my collection of I Dream Of Jeannie DVD's that I bought and the bottoms of the discs were all blushed and clouded and unplayable even though there are brand new and I just opened them. I don't know what to do. I'm looking for recalls on the internet for the DVDs.More info later if I have any luck.I can't get the DVDs to play on ANYONE ELSES players either.
4,Moving bottle,"I only watched it at a glance, but when tony first see's the bottle it moves a couple of times before he decides to pick it up. In the DVD he picks it up on the first move. Am I wrong? I will get my Black + White version soon.When Jeanie rolls the bottle in to Tony's sack did anyone notice she never put the cork back on the bottle?? Because back at Tony's house during the series, there is a cork on it. Thanks.I will buy the entire series when it comes out."
2,I Dream of Sammy,"At the very heart of this show is a sad fact: Jeannie just did not have the depth of character of Samantha Stephens. If you want to delve further into the cast you'd just dig yourself deeper; the mainstay cast of IDOJ just doesn't measure up to Bewitched and since they are both now on dvd, why waste time on Jeannie?Dick York > Larry HagmanLiz Montgomery > Barbara EdenLarry White > Bill DailyEndora > Doc BellowsIn many ways IDOJ is like Gilligans Island; it's a guilty pleasure that many won't admit to in the morning."
4,"If I could only have one papermaking book,this would be it.","As a beginner papermaker interested in working with plant fibers, this book fulfills most of my papermaking needs: clear, concise instructions and illustrations; some good basic recipes; and great ideas to get the creative juices flowing. All this in a beautiful book that is also an interesting read."
5,I LOVE this book!,"I always wanted to make paper. However, the idea of making paper out of paper, seems idiotic to me. Then I found this book. It's everything I ever wanted. I recommend it for anyone. I would also make a great gift."
3,Poor Sound Quality,"Nice thought, but drop-outs from poor tape sources, especially on ""There Is"", causes this set to be suitable for AM radio only. I've heard Chess/MCA LP ""rips"" sound better."
5,a Great Compilation,"first of all the Dells Belong in the Rock&Roll Hall Of Fame.next this Set truly captures so much of what Made the Dells One of the Tightest&Baddest Groups.so Much SOul&Warmth through this Double Set.""Oh What a Night"" alone moves me&Grooves me."
5,R2-D2 ROCKS!,"I am the Star Wars FanaticThis little astro-mech droid is cool man! This droid is very fun to play with. My friend said he also likes the toy! Buy this toy I am serious. Star wars 3.75 Basic Figure R2-D2 is very awesome. The paint job is great. I bought this with the Count Dooku Electronic Lightsaber. But, I should cut to the chase. The top of the figure is really shiny. And looks like the actual droid!"
2,R2-D2's size tricked me!,"Well the toy is nice, it is really very different from the first one around 1980, but when I bought this toy I thought it was quite bigger, and based on that, I'm rating this guy not that good, I was expecting a bigger toy as I said, and for the price I don't think it worth it. In the picture it really looks cool and big, but it is only like 2"" big. So not happy because I will need to buy another one, and bigger so it can fit my star wars helmets collection."
4,"Early Koop, Remixed","A must have if you are looking for Nu Jazz. Koop are great! Koop remixed is OK but you must remember this CD is homemade.You should really get the ""Islands"" from Koop to really appreciate them."
1,Umm...well it's...hmm,"This album is a let down. I fell in love with ""Waltz for Koop"" and thought that because some nice artist were doing a remix that ""Alternative Takes"" would be even better. Well I have to say that I was disappointed with the album. One remix in particular ""Modal Mile"" was almost laughable( I have to admit I am laughing at it now). And that is awful, because I loved Earl Zinger's version on the original album. ""In A Heartbeat"" and ""Summer Sun""(Carlito remix) weren't that bad. I don't give up easy, I will give this album more try. I just may have not be receptive to it right now. Overall this is not a must have album unlike ""Waltz for Koop""."
1,Not what I expected,The picture and first description are deceiving. It said it was a case that could hold a gameboy advance and I received a game boy color case which will not hold a advance or its games. I was very disappointed. They should change the picture and change the product details that are listed under the picture.
5,"I am a fan and I loved seeing this film, I left a bigger fan.","I saw this film in the theater when it was first released. It was so fun to hear more about TMBG. I was not a super duper fan, just a fan, so much of the information was new to me and so CHARMING! We are not charmed enough in this life. I liked the interviews with indie/geek celebrities. The film made me seek out more TMBG, I felt like part of a bigger movement than just a couple silly songs."
4,Great Peer Inside,It's always great to see the people in a band you herald as demio-gods are actually implicitly quite human. I was so reluctant to knock TMBG off the pedestal I've built that it took a good long while to force myself to sit down and watch this doc.Boy I'm glad I did! A great insight to the minds of TMBG as well as their fans and various others who contribute to John and John. A must watch even if you don't like watching documentaries.
5,My cupcakes!,"As an obsessive TMBG fan, I thought that this documentary was a really fun insight into the band. But, I must admit, the best thing about it for me was that the cupcakes that I made and brought them at one of their shows are in the movie! How much more fame can I ask for?"
5,A Must for Any TMBG Fan!,"It is insane how much stuff is packed into this. 4 1/2 hours of extras! This is the most amazing document of TMBG stuff ever assembled. The extras are truly fantastic with tons of unusual archived broadcasts, videos and really off-the-wall rarities. Don't forget to download the freebie clock radio at www.tmbg.com to hear songs that aren't available anywhere else!"
4,The tale of 2 mad geniuses,If you've ever wondered how this band got together...this is your answer. It follows the 2 Johns through the travels and tribulations of creating one of the more innovative bands to come from New York in the 80's (without a drummer and bass player).It follows them through the original ideas with vintage photos and videos of the bands early days up to the more recent studio time. It delves into their obsession with coffee and answering machines.
4,Concise Veterinary Dictionary,"This `Concise Veterinary Dictionary' is a great reference book for Veterinary students, as well as for other animal care courses. It is also good for those who work with animals or have an interest in them in general. There are plenty of technical terms in here, as well as more general information that may be of use to pet owners who wish to learn more about any conditions their animals may have. There are numerous illustrations throughout to clarify certain points and the writing is clear to read. This is a great dictionary and one of the only ones of it's kind and makes for a great reference book. If this doesn't provide all the info you may want then you could also check out the Oxford Dictionary of Zoology which may be of some use, although some of the information does overlap.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,Poor compatibility with iPAQ 6315,"With this battery, on my 6315, I get this error message: ""An unrecognized battery bas been detected. This battery will discharge and will not allow charging. It is recommended that you plug your device into an AC power source and back up your data. Please purchase an HP authorized battery [...]"
2,"John F. Kennedy - Years of Lightning, Day of Drums.","The DVD is of very poor quality. The picture is blurry and often it is hard to make out the faces, places etc. A very poor quality picture indeed. I wish I had never ordered it. What a disappointment from the original documentary that I remember from the first time it was released."
4,Helen Gardner is an Authority,"Four Quartets is unarguably Eliot's masterpiece, one of the last things he wrote. It is a notoriously difficult work to read, but Helen Gardner is the authority on the matter.Although I don't find her writing style to be as accessible as Reibetanz's book on the Four Quartets, she will help anyone to a deeper understanding of these beautiful, philosophical poems. Unfortunately such books tend to be out of print, but if you can find a copy somewhere and you want to come to a better understanding of Eliot's poems, grab it! Otherwise check your library."
4,Great Classroom Music and Phonics instruction,"I ordered this book, and had to wait a few weeks to receive it, but it was worth the wait. I am currently using it in my third grade classroom to teach my students phonics and how the blends and digraphs make the sounds that they make. The tape is very good, because it has the children follow the singer once, and then they try it along with the singer a second time. I found it very useful, and the kids love the songs."
2,Not for adults,"I purchased this glove for my use while catching my 11 yoa daughter who hurls at about 50 mph - catching her hurts! So I bought what I thought would be a solution. I have a med-lg hand with long fingers and could not get my three smaller fingers comfortably in the mitt. The index finger was tight as well. While I did not catch her with the glove as the fit was not good, the padding seemed insufficient for my daughter's speed. This mitt may work well for a youngster. It seems to be well-made otherwise."
5,Mizuno Classic Pro,"I have purchased several catcher's mitts for my daughter over the years. This is by far the best one yet. It broke in very quickly, yet it is extremely durable. I would recommend this mitt to anyone."
3,Where's the beef?,"Unfortunately this book has no ""meat"" to it. It is basically a very weak outline of seemingly randomly ordered subjects. About the only good thing about it is that it gives no detail; therefore it is easy to read. For example, p. 135 ARDS: risk factors-toxic inhalation, sepsis, shock, diffuse pneumonia, Management-identify the cause, mechanical ventilation, try to avoid barotrauma to the lungs, glucocoticoids for late phase ARDS, Prognosis-50-70%. I'm not sure what this information would add to your knowledge of ARDS? Any resident or perhaps medical student would probably know any of these basic facts after their rotation. Furthermore, the alphabetical order of subjects is rather irritating and not useful. A reviewer said that it's good to use once you are done studying your other material. But why would you want to review something so basic that contributes little to what you already know? Ultimately I find there is no reason to use this book."
2,too many errors,the content is terribly inaccurate and outdated. I will look for other books for step 3. It is simply full of incorrect information on the not only diagnostics but also treatments.
2,Not that good....,"This book focuses on subjects asked on the step 3 exam, but it needs to be rewritten to focus on the specific order one must follow in evaluating patients. Step 3 is about choosing a 1st step, 2nd step or 3rd step. The set up of the book is good, but the info. is not complete. Residency Programs vary in their protocols so for this standardized exam it is imperative that you learn exactly the test protocols. If Andreas Carl would add these changes...this book could be excellent. At this point it is not good enough. A better choice is Adam Brochert's Crush step 3."
2,Not the size advertised,"This is not the one I needed but it is what came up when I entered a search for replacement # 214a0461 so I ordered it. I wish I had read the other review because this is not what I needed and apparently they should know that. FYI: The packaging reads that it fits the following Coleman Lanterns: 222, 226, 229, 3022, 3023, 3150, 5130, 5133, 5134, 5136 & 5414."
1,Too small,The dimensions of this globe were not included in the description. It looked right in the picture but in reality it is about half the size that I need. Shiping is just too expensive to return it.
1,Wrong Size Replacement,Entered Colemant replacement part # in search window. The search returned a product page for a Coleman replacement globe but not product or size information. Turned out not to be even close in size.
1,Too small,Read the dimensions of the glass prior to ordering and what I received was significantly smaller. Now I have to return.
2,Holy wrinkles batman,"I know this is a very cheap price for a 2-pack of pants but being cheap does not make up for the wrinkles. In fact, I'm glad I waited until after I washed them to write my review. When they first came I was very impressed! They looked nice, fit very well and were comfortable. Then I washed them (and I washed them myself so i know they came right out of the dryer). When I looked at them I immediately noticed that they had become wrinkled from top to bottom. Actually, I'm not sure if wrinkled is the right word because it is more like they are puckered from top to bottom. The originally smooth fabric turned bumpy and uneven. There is not an iron in the word that could tame these pants and I'll probably wind up sending them back."
3,Good but not great.,"This book does a good job at explaining the ""how to"" of customer service but, there wasn't enough information there to justify spending $11.95. Don't get me wrong; the information is helpful and provides a common-sense approach to providing customer service. We all need to learn more about our good customers and provide better service to them while, at the same time, improving service to the other customers we have. The amount of information in the book, for the price, left me wanting."
4,"Fun, fast and thought provoking","I read ""How to Create Customers as Loyal as Norm Peterson"" in about and hour, but spent much more than that planning how to apply the lessons I found in the book to my own marketing efforts.As a devoted ""Cheers"" watcher (original shows, not the syndicated ones) I loved all of the characters. It was obvious that each one had a special reason for spending so much time in the bar. By tying customer service principles to Norm's reasons for being there, Mike Synk gives us some very usable tips for building customer loyalty."
4,Dark Heart,I give the book 4 star becase it is a GREAT book but it has a wierd ending I am waiting for book 2 of the series to come out.
2,Not Margaret's Best,"This wasn't my favorite Margaret Weis book. The story seemed a tad familiar, like some fantasy/Detective story you'd find on tv. I'm not crazy about stories with men who morph into some kind of creature (or visa versa), especially a dragon, so I should have steered clear."
5,Dark Heart,This was one of the best books that I've read. I love all of Weis's books especially the Darksword seies and this one. The only problem I found is that I am so anxiuos to get the next one in the series. Also I believe that this could be an awsome book to movie. I would love to see what todays technology could do with it.
4,A Hero you can understand...,"Justin wants to do the right thing. He struggles to be a decent person. But his Master doesn't allow such ""noble"" tendencies to rule the Disciples that the Master rules!But for the death of beloved Weis's son David, we'd have all been blessed with the sequels to (what first began as) this series.Dark Heart was Book I...if you read it, enjoy it. But give understanding to the ending, and respect Margaret's decision not to continue, as Dragon's Disciple was her son's creation.Perhaps someday, someone she trusts and respects will ask her permissionto try/attempt to finish what they began. Then, perhaps we'll have the sequels that should have been.But yes, still a good read, and another Exceptional Weis corroboration."
4,"Well written, grabs the reader","I saw this book at the library and decided to see what it was about. I was hooked the minute I sat down; started it in the evening, finished it this morning. The book is well written, moves at a good pace, and combines adventure, morality, romance, and mystery to make for a very good story. My only criticism is that the main characters' could have been more fully developed; also the relationship between the two main characters could have been looked at more closely. However...I still couldn't put the book down! I am looking forward to the next book, as it appears there will be another one??"
5,What a Great Freaking DVD!,"Not your typical live song concert DVD. Don't expect complete songs in nice glamourous venues and hard rockin' all the time. Ain't what this is about. This is a look at touring life- punk rock style. Reminds me of that Social D. bus tour documentary. And contrary to what others here say, I only like the band even more after watching this!"
5,Fantastic +++++++++++++++++,"This is one of those rare DVD's that actually gives you something from the artist... a gift to the fans. It documents the last ten days of the bands most recent US Tour and we see it in all it's honesty. The band is tired. They are playing gigs with a small crew, setting up their own gear (not the way they tour elsewhere I'm sure!), playing little dive bars & rock clubs, glad-handing the fanboys, playing at radio stations- all over the states.Now The Hellacopters could have released a DVD of their tour in Brazil playing to 30,000 rock dogs a night in arenas, or playing huge outdoor shows in Sweden, but they gave us this glimpse into the other side of being a rocker. Job well done."
1,"Great band, bad DVD","I LOVE the Hellacopters...But this DVD is bad. Very little concert footage, and the band come across as bitter and rude to their fans. I've already given it away."
4,A BladeZ is a BladeZ,I have had this scooter for 3 years now and it is dead. This scooter works when you keep charging it. You must be dedicated to this scooter. The scooter must always be charged or the battery will run out.I didn't charge the scooter for one month and then charged it for 24 hours and it didn't go over 5mph. Then I charged it again for a while and it still didn't work right. A replacement battery costs over $120.It was a cool scooter at first when I rode it and charged it all the time. The scooter is an okay scooter if you are dedicated.
2,not-so-good game,This is a average game. This game would be much better if it was harder to hit a home-run. You easily hit home-runs about 35% percent of the time. And I also don't like the pitching system. You get bored of it so easily. I would not buy this game if I were you. Just buy MLB 2k6 or maybe MLB 2k5 The World Seris Edition.(I heard it's great)
2,"MVP is not quite as exciting, but gameplay is better","I've bought both MVP and this game... MVP is the one I will continue to play. I absolutely love ESPN's presentation. Joe Morgan and Jon Miller are absolutely fantastic as well. But the game is frustrating in regards to game play... and game play is everything! Baserunning, slow outfielders, and all players being equal is not cool. Baserunning is incredibly difficult, which is the main reason I went back to MVP. But, also, the Dynasty Mode in MVP is so much easier to handle and much more interesting than the equal mode (sorry, can't recall what it is in ESPN) in ESPN. Overall, the game is just better presented in MVP. ESPN looks better, but just looks aren't everything. I'll come back to ESPN in a couple of years hoping that they improve on gameplay. For now, I'm sticking with MVP."
1,Lacking the Most Important,First to answer Tom question Acclaim went bankrupt so there will be no more All Star Baseball. To bad to for it was by far the best out there. But that actually brings me to my complaint of MLB 2K5. I like baseball games where they have the real players for at least the 25 man roster which this game does not. Plus the pitchers don't have there real life wined ups like they had in All Star Baseball(which if you ask me ruined the game right there). Second the batters don't have there real life stances(like they did in All Star Baseball). I am going to sell my copy of Major League Baseball 2K5 back. And wait for 989 sports MLB 2006 which is do out in a couple of weeks. At least when Take Two bought the rights to MLB they made it so 989's baseball game will stay around. Unless Take Two does a hell of a lot better job on next years game. I will stick with 989
2,Close but just a deep fly...,"While 2K5 revamps the baseball genre a bit with flashy graphics and new components it falls short in a nmuber of areas. And when compared to EA's MVP 2005 it is even worse. 2K5 employs stunning graphics but thats about it. The pitchers all seem to have the same ""stuff"" where Jason Schmidt's 99 MPH fastball acts looks and is basically the same as Kirk Rueter's. Whereas the outfield arms of Vladimir Guerrero and any other player are the same. The hits seem to follow a familiar patter of animation and action and it all gets kind of old. The smash zone is ludicris and should be relegated to such games as Slugfest or MLB Street if it existed. All in all MLB 2k5 is just average, the simulation core is weak and the overall style just falls short. But for 20$ it's not a bad buy."
4,Very Realistic!,"This game is realistic and fun to play. Even though pitching is harder that other baseball games, it is very fun to play with my son Ryan. The downside of the game is that they mixed up the numbers the players wear. I like the realistic sound effects. It feels like I'm actually at a baseball game. My son likes the season mode! I had to do some work on the Brewers because they mixed up some of the numbers and didn't have some players. It's still a lot of fun."
3,GET JETTER OFF THE COVER!!!!!!!!!!,I've never played this game so disreguard the star ratings I gave it. I am only writing this review beause while I was scroling down through the games I saw Derek Jetter's ugly mug. Don't spoil what could be a great game by putting a horrific image like that on the cover!!
4,Game Boy Camera,"A cool gadget, play games with faces, decorate little pictures, great toy to annoy little brothers or sisters."
3,Pretty good,"I like some of the workouts, but sometimes I felt I wasn't working hard enough. They are fun for a moderate-workout day though and I like that the core workout does actually work the whole core and not just the abs. And you get plenty of stretching and toning with the ""Yoga"" part of YBB. The instructors are fun and helpful without the annoying ""u-rah-rah"" you get from some fitness instructors. The free squishy ball I got was pretty useless, though. It's too big and not squishy; more like a dodge ball or kick ball."
5,Spoken Word @ Its Best,"Dark, smokey basements & turtleneck sweaters -- this ain't your momma's poetry. Miles Long Mix Tape is a commendable blend of jazz, funk, and spoken word, with melodies swirling through lyrics that are bound to stir one's intellect & emotions.Live arrangements have evolved since this CD was recorded, so if Miles Long is performing in your area be sure not to miss them. It's an experience you won't soon forget."
3,Sort of boring,"This game had all of the action and side scrolling adventure as the first TMNT game for Gameboy, plus much better graphics, detailed backgrounds and far better music. However, the game was so needlessly repetitive and long that it got very boring. There are only five levels to this, very long levels, where you fight off against hundreds of foot soldiers, annoying mousers that chomp through walls and pizza monsters that are tougher than any of the leaders. I do enjoy the fact that this game had Krang with his body! No amount of graphics, challenge or gameplay could keep this long of a game going."
2,sometimes,needs more info as to how much smoke juice is too much. and what to expect from smoke production I never know how much smoke I will get or if I have a problem with batteries or what. because sometimes I get no smoke.
1,Bogus stick,Extremely disappointed with this product. Used as per instructions and the alleged plume of smoke was less than smoking a cigarette. I get more ooos and ahhhs from an average fart. Kudos on the quick shipping. It would have been nice to know that it requires 6 AA batteries.
4,Would be perfect if it was more durable,"I've purchased several of these. They are very delicate and dropping them can crack the delicate glass tube the smoke is excreted out of. It can seem like it's not making much smoke and if that's the case you didn't let it ""warm"" up enough before you squeezed. The button on the trigger turns on the heater, the squeezing of the trigger pushes the fog juice through the heating element, the hotter the element the more smoke you get. As you squeeze the fog juice cools off the heating element and requires recharging time. Use good batteries otherwise it will drain in about an hour of use. Good batteries last 2 or more hours of constant playing. very hard to hack up but possible to make it smaller if your delicate with a dremel tool or something."
3,Great for K9 NoseWork,"This is a great tool for K9 NoseWork. It is great for showing how scent dissipates. Just point, where the treat would be,and watch where the smoke goes.Read and follow the directions carefully, it is easy to burn out the heating element."
5,Great for K9 Nose work!,"I'm having lots of fun with this. Taking a class in K9 Nose work (odor recognition)and the Wizard Stick is a perfect indicator of how air and scent travels differently in different locations. Even indoors, fans and heating vents cause air flow. It is good training for the humans to see how scent might pool in one area or flow in another. Cool toy."
3,Ok at best.,"At best I can only rate the Wizard Stick as OK. Mainly because it's very difficult to get consistent smoke from it and the more times you use it in a single session the less smoke it seems to put out.The Wizard Stick arrives in a clear baggie with zero retail packaging which is probably why I could not locate it at any retail store.Construction of the Wizard Stick is at least 90% plastic that feels like it would shatter if dropped so I wouldn't expect it too last long if used by children.On the plus side you do recieve a quite large bottle of the smoke fluid so there is no need to purchase additional smoke fluid, at least not right away. The Wizard Sticks price of $19.95 is fair but this definently is not something that will last for years."
5,Wizard Stick is awesome!,"This has got to be the coolest way to make fog. Easy, press the button and it's ready to go. If you are looking to add some fog to your life, magic show or where ever ~ this is easy to adapt and hack for your purposes.I use it in my soap bubble shows and it has never failed me.Cheap too."
3,"Essential, Though Better Maps Would Be Nice","This excellent and indispensable guide is thoroughly researched, richly illustrated with photographs, and well written. But while it is an essential book for anyone planning a visit to Middle Earth, it is handicapped by one glaring omission: though several maps are provided, none adequately indicate the locations of Middle Earth's features. This is frustrating for anyone who wishes to use the book as a travel guide (though it is always possible to sort out locations by using the text and the limited maps provided) and a serious drawback for the armchair traveler who just wants to get a sense of how Middle Earth maps onto New Zealand.Be sure to get the ""Revised Edition""."
4,Good but could have been better,"With something approaching 100,000 copies in print this is one of the all time best-selling NZ books. Probably the publisher didn't expect it to be the sales success it has been otherwise more money would have been spent on it. The pictures are all there but they are are small. A bigger page format would have done them and the beatiful scenery justice. It's nice to know where the scenes were filmed, but don't expect to recognise the settings in the film instantly as there was a heap of digital manipulation done and a standard requirement of their getting permission to use the locations was that everything look the same after they had finished. I haven't been on one of the guided tours but I think that would be the best way to go, rather than use this book as a self guide."
2,Where is the map?!?!,"I cannot believe that this book lacks the single most obvious thing that such a book should have - A MAP OF THE LOCATIONS DESCRIBED!! There is one giant map of NZ, with a few cities on it. And there are a small handful of zoomed-in maps of a few given locations. But what there logically should be is a map of NZ, showing where these locations are! Very frustrating thing to leave out.Other than that, the book provides pretty much everything else one might need: descriptions, pictures, some limited information on reaching the places (very limited), and even GPS coordinates. But the lack of maps, and the limited directions, make this book lacking in a big way."
3,A good guide!,"The history of making ""Lords of Te Ring"" and the making of movie was wall written. Yet, it is a paper book. It can be upgraded to a much lively interactive version. For instance, by using the current well-preserved ""Hobbit"" village, more can be written with the emphasis of the climate, scenery and people of NZ. They are the people from Middle Earth!"
5,"Good book, Nice land","When you are going on holiday the NZ. This is the book to check out. Lot's of picture of the country. I shows the atmosphere of the nature of NZ.If you are a fan of LotR this is the book to read and check out the locations of the movie. You even have GPS locations. You need a 4x4 to get to the most of the locations, but a couple of them are easy to check out.Enjoy the book"
1,Worthless hygrometer,"This item is supposed to measure relative humidity and temperature. The unit I received does neither accurately. The hygrometer readings are way off, and my attempts at calibration did not correct this. The temperature readings are somewhat closer to being accurate, but are off by 2-3 degrees. And there appears to be no way to calibrate temperature. I bought this thinking it would be accurate because it is German-made. Considering the price of this instrument, I would strongly recommend against buying it."
4,Accurate but must be calibrated,"I've used many of these devices over the years, but the hygrometer must be calibrated with a sling psychrometer before use and then checked from time to time in the future. The calibration is easy with a small screwdriver through the back. When calibrated the accuracy is better than any digital equivalent I have tried, and I'm very fussy about humidity because I must keep it constant for woods I use in my craft (guitar making)."
4,Reves by Gerard Emilien,"A welcome and refreshing change from the music I get subjected to at home! I often catch myself humming the tunes to myself throughout the day (even in the classroom!).Is it because of the mystery behind words I can only guess at, or the specific melody of the songs in Creole, they are definitely my favourites - Mamzelle especially."
2,Low Quality,"The quality of this item is pretty bad. The 2 pieces don't fit together very well, allowing a large enough gap that it would end up blowing air from the dryer into the room unless you wrap it with some type of duct tape. You can buy a better quality version of this item right at your local Lowes. If I'd have known that, that's what I would have done.In fact, when I went to Lowes to pick up some other items to complete this project, I saw the better version of it, bought it, and installed it. Plan to throw this one away ... would have loved to return it but didn't keep any of the packaging materials. Do yourself a favor, buy it at Lowes and not here on amazon."
1,Junk,Material to thin or light. Couldn't keep it in shape while moving dryer into place. It keep bending. It's in the trash!
5,Did the job!,"This periscope allowed me to redirect the exhaust and move my over/under washer/dryer 2 inches closer to the wall, which in turn allowed me to utilize both doors in my utility room. Because I extended it to the max I sealed the sliding parts with silicone to assure that all the hot exhaust went outside. I have not complaints and would buy it again if the need arose."
5,ESR,"This is their 4th single off Sleeping With Ghosts, and it is the enhanced version, which includes the animated music video. The version of the title track is off the album. One of placebo's best releases, no doubt, despite the repetitivness of the lyrics. Backed with a great remix of the title track, and an equally impressive remix of 'This Picture', the second single from this album, which also appeared on the bonus disc for their singles release, 'Once More With Feeling'. Another top release, and possibly one of their best ever. Great single."
3,The GREAT War,"Charles Esdaile's short monograph provides students a basic outline for twenty-three years of warfare in Europe -a continuum traveling from Valmy to Waterloo. Solid maps and chronologies compliment the author's readable prose as, chapter by chapter, Esdaile deals with the efforts of succeeding anti-French coalitions. The author concludes with a chapter investigating the recent historiography of the era, discussing key points of the various works. He concludes with a short but useful bibliographic essay. I think this book is ideal for those who want to begin serious study of this period's conflicts. I recommend following it with Esdaile's The WARS of NAPOLEON, Gates' The NAPOLEONIC WARS and Owen Connelly's BLUNDERING to GLORY."
5,"Sensual, raw talent","I am incredibly tired of the multitude of sax players who play the same tedious EZ listening muzak (John Tesh is the devil). The sax is the most fluid instrument and Mindi Abair plays with a maturity and style that are uniquely her own. Her songs are tightly woven with her accompaniment, without surrendering to it.Some people have issues with her vocals, but I find them refreshing, inviting and sultry, reminiscent of Norah Jones and Sheryl Crow."
2,"Disappointment , hurts to write this, sorry Mindi","I love Mindi's first 2 cds and I guess they are so good that this cd just cant live up to them. I pre-ordered and couldnt wait for release. Upon arrival, I instantly plugged this cd into the player and was throughly disappointed. It absolutely didnot live up to my expectations, those expectations being set by her first 2 cds. But however, I forced myself to listen to it again and again and I have to admit it has grown on me some--but not much. This cd will end up in the stack of hardly listened to cds. Mindi sings and she has a good voice, but I dont purchase her cds to her her voice, I purchase to hear her sax!! If you have yet to buy her first 2 cds, spend your money there, they are better. Mindi, I have not given up on you, you are toooo good and I am looking forward to your next cd."
5,always a favorite,"Thanks for getting it to my doorstep quickly. She's been a favorite since I first saw her on Catalina Island, and she didn't let her fans down with this release."
2,boohoo,"Sorry to say, this is the first disappointment from a rockin' talented artist. Having seen Mindi a number of times and knowing what she's capable of, this cd's a let down. Too much singing. Too little funk. Love the girl still, but waiting for the next one."
1,Lifeless and Ordinary,"This cd is boring. It is not jazz, or even smooth jazz, just instrumental pop music that would work great as background music for an infomercial. If you like monotonous pop, like Celine Dion or Kenneth Gorelick (aka Kenny G), you will probably like this.I, however, would advise you to look into finding music that isn't so life-less and ordinary."
