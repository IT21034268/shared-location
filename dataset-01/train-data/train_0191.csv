3,Die Hard - ok,"All of you are taking this movie way too seriously. Its an ACTION movie. Not a documentary. Did you actually expect that you were going to gain some inspiring, intellectual knowledge from watching this movie? Lighten up! Its supposed to be entertaining and implausible. And yes, all 4 of these Die Hard movies have implausible scenarios. I guess none of you are big fans of Jason Bourne or James Bond, huh? I thought it was entertaining. And while I'm not a computer geek, I didn't find the computer jargon to be all that complicated to understand and it was minimal at best."
4,"Not bad, not bad at all.","Although I disagree with the casting of the villain, this wasn't a bad movie. In my opinion, this is the second best die hard. 1st, 4th, 3rd, then 2nd. You should definately get this movie, its a must have."
5,Good as Die Hard 1,"Die hard 1 is a classic. Die hard 2 & 3 just plain sucked! I didn't think old Brucey could pull it off again. Then as the movie progressed I found myself laughing more and rooting for him again as I did in the original. sure I would have changed a couple of unbelievable feats, but isn't that what movies are created for...to escape the real world! I wouldn't say this was better then the original. I would say it was just as entertaining. Im glad I bought it. I wont tell you the price cause I don't want my review to be deleted. But suffice to say I got the 2 disc version really cheap and it was worth every penny!"
4,Great movie - Realistic Scenario of 'Digital Pearl Harbor',"This movie looks at what happens when all digital traffic gets disrupted. It aint a pretty picture and shows the vulnerability we have here in the U.S. in case our digital support system breaks down. Remember, the Internet never came out of beta..."
5,One more great movie in a great franchise,"I love action movies and I always have. The key is to not take them too seriously.But Live Free or Die Hard has all the fun, action and comedy of the best action flicks while still having an intelligent plot."
2,UMMMM..........right..,I figured just by watching the trailers for this flick that it would be far fetched as hell! WOW was I right! Especially the last 15 minutes of this crapfest. I was in awe at how bad the jet/semi truck chase scene was. What an F'n Joke!!!! I don't mind a little over the top nonsense but this was worse than SPEED. And SPEED was a horrible flick!!! Rent this and laugh but do not buy!!!
2,BluRay Butchers Bruce and Amazon Drops A Clanger - NOT MULTI REGION,"This was an excellent movie at the cinema in the UK, done a terrible injustice in this Blu-Ray rip-off...But even worse, for us Brits, is the fact that Amazon's information for multi-region users, usually very good, is way, way off... and buyers outside of the Region A will be finding that this movie is not, as Amazon report, 'All Regions', it is in fact a strictly locked Region A.Useless information to those of us who import our quality entertainment."
4,Good movie but has a few issues.,"This movie is good, but it has a few issues. Some of the one-liners are dumb and some of the action scenes could've been better; also Willis' character whines a little too much. This movie is well worth watching. 8/10"
2,Least Favorite of the Series,"I believe they have run out of material. The story line and scenes were not believable. I have enjoyed the previous Diehard movies and have copies of them. But this one I have no desire to keep. Although there is a lot of action, it did not live up to expectations."
4,Unrated version is overrated!,"The only difference between the 2-disc Unrated DVD version of this movie and the original version is a lot of profanity (curse words). Other than that, there's no difference in action sequences. If I had known, I would have bought this Blu-Ray version instead. So buy this! It's in Hi-Def!"
1,Lousy Quality!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This DVD is supposed to be Blu-Ray, but it doesn't look like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Every scene is dark and some are not clear. I've seen non-bluray copies of this movie that looked much better."
4,great movie,just got it and it is awesome. I will be watching this movie for years to come. Can't wait for the new movie to come out next month
4,Entertaining,"Much better than Die Hard 3 which is a complete waste of time, this one returns you to the action."
4,Great Movie for Action Fans and Die Hard Fans,"If you like action movies, get this movie.If you like Die Hard movies, get this movie.If you like good-quality movies, get this movie.As long as you're okay with some things being unrealistic, you'll have a great time!"
2,die hard 4,"good movie if you liked the first three, not as good as 1 or 3 but better then 2.i don't think this will leed to #5."
3,Good action movie,"Not the best Die Hard, McLane is getting older, but this kind of movie is still enjoyable if you take off your brain when you launch the dvd! Clearly not the movie of the year but still a great entertainment."
2,Didn't Capture Me,"The newest edition to the Die Hard franchise just doesn't measure up to the first two stellar movies, nor even the less than brilliant Die Hard 3. I tried watching the movie on three separate occasions and just could never get into it. The Mac TV Ad guy Justin Long as a computer hacker was less than original casting and made it feel like one long computer advertisement. Bruce Willis does his best with a forgettable script. For pure entertainment, I recommend the first two Die Hard films over this one."
2,not like the others,"Kind of like the latest Bond movie, okay, but not really a movie you can watch over and over. Rent dont buy"
2,Way too over the top.,"I have liked some of the previous Die Hard films, but this one was just way way over the top. The plot was beyond preposterous and some of the action scenes were just ridiculous. I think the Transformers was more realistic than this. I don't mind suspending logic, but when it gets to the ""silly"" level I lose interest. The thing that gets me with these films is the same old re-hashed formula they use over and over again. They make the cops/feds have zero IQ's and the bad guys are geniuses. That is, until McClane shows up. Then the bad guys all of a sudden have zero IQ's and he's the genius. One of these days Hollywood is going to shock me and come up with something new and original. Well, maybe not."
2,Decline Hard!,"After a 12-year absence, Bruce Willis returns as New York detective John McClane in this disappointing ""Die Hard"" sequel. Willis delivers the ""yippee ki yay"" goods, but the film lacks a strong cast, coherent scripting and the firm hand of director John McTiernan. The cyber-terrorist plot is a letdown after McClane's cat-and-mouse games with the Gruber brothers - further hindered by cartoonish action sequences and a ludicrous climax. Though slightly better than ""Die Hard 2,"" this fourth installment doesn't measure up to the Willis-McTiernan collaborations."
3,Mac owners! Digital copy does not work on Mac,Bought the DVD w/the included digital copy only to find out that the digital copy cannot be downloaded to a Mac computer (work only on Window computers). I wished they had put it clearly in the description when you buy the DVD.
2,Non stop action + Big explosions + Outrageously illogical = worth renting,"This movie has non-stop action and big explosions. Yet it's so outrageously illogical that it's funny in many scenes. For example the scene on the brigde where Bruce did a lot of dangerous jumping and fighting. However, he got no serious injuries! No broken bones! There's no suspense at all.I found the first installment is more suspenseful.It's still worth renting."
3,Live free or die hard,It was okay. I have ahard time watching people fly through the air with out getting a scratch on them.
4,Good but,"this is a good movie, but just like every other die hard movie some of the things are a little, how can i say it, exagerated?other wise this is a great film"
3,Women and Self-Harm,"I found it pretty informative, and it had many relating factors to my life. I especially enjoyed the comments from actual cutters. It was so good to know that I wasn't the only one out there!! For years I thought that I was. This book was a comfort as well as a healing for me, thank you."
1,Dull book- full of other people's information,"Of all the books on self injury, this is one of the least informative. I am still not sure why this book was printed. No list of resources - no real hope - I am more depressed than ever"
2,Strictly for the novice,"Serious scholars of the Lincoln Assassination should pass this one up. It's strictly for the novice student. Some of the major personna are glossed over, or in some cases, not even mentioned.(Dr. Samuel Mudd for one) A good portion of the tape covers the monuments to Lincoln, which doesn't add to the story of the murder. I was pleased to see some of the goofy conspiracy theories de-bunked, including the one claiming that the Vatican wanted Lincoln dead. Or that Stanton hatched the whole thing and had to scramble to cover it all up. Sounds like some of that mindless dribble on ""Coast to Coast"" with George Norri. Lincoln will continue to fascinate us and as Stanton said when the 16th president died on the morning of April 15, ""..... he belongs to the ages"""
5,Review of Worm's Wagon,"Worm's Wagon is the story of my life. I love it because it so simply depicts what can happen when one doesn't know how to balance out their lives, and at least the main character in this story had helpful friends to put his wagon back together. Often in real life, that's not the case. So, it's a helpful story told in a children's book, but also appeals to adults who can benefit from its wisdom. Book came in good condition, too."
5,Great Teaching Tool,I used this book to teach the letter x to my preschool class. It is an excellent teaching tool because it uses x in many different ways and is also entertaining to children.
1,Not as expected,I ordered for this NB-5L battery for my Canon SD800.In the site the product specification is 1200mAh. But the one was sent to me was 1000mAh.There is no mention of the manufacturer as it was in the site. Now I've to return this back to Amazon.
3,Great back-up battery,"I wanted a second battery to use when the charge on my main (Canon brand) battery runs out. At about 1/5 the cost of a Canon battery, this Synergy has been a lifesaver many times. It fits into the side pocket of my teeny camera case, and I never have to worry about losing pictures when my regular battery runs out of juice. I just pop this one into the camera, and use it until I can recharge my main battery. The charge on this one doesn't last anywhere near as long as the Canon-brand battery, but it works great as the back-up I needed."
5,Uniden two way Radios,"Works fine for my needs, got them for a good price,clear, and easy to use.Uniden makes good units for lower cost."
4,Old Edition?,"The picture shown for this item is not the latest edition. Look for the 7th edition with the brown cover,The Official ACBL Encyclopedia of Bridge; Brent Manley is the editor. From the Wikipedia article:6 Sixth edition - 20017 Seventh edition - 2011The latest edition is a substantial reorganization. I bought mine from Amazon, as an upgrade from the 5th edition, but have not used it that much. It comes with the entire book as a PDF on CD, plus a PDF that I think is largely material removed (or not added to) from the latest edition. I use it to look up bidding conventions an plays - and, of course, best plays in suits. If you are serious about the game, you must have Eric Crowhurst's suit combinations section of the Encyclopedia - but it's in every edition."
3,Too redundant and pedantic,"Health care reform is a critical issue. The authors are well-known, highly educated, and know their subject well. Unfortunately, they wrote a book whose redundancies, especially in the opening chapters, drives the reader to boredom. Likewise, the reader feels at times as though the good professors were trying to fulfil a mandatory page count, and therefore, inserted much irrelavant data. Frankly, I set the book aside, planning on finishing it after more readable books have been read."
4,A new look,"Though a little dry, and at times repetitive, this book offers practical information. In a mess of books describing the massive problems in healthcare today, this book was at once motivating and up-lifting. I bought it for a class, but it is one of the books I'll be keeping instead of passing along at the end of the quarter."
3,"Good ideas, but poor suggestions for plan execution","Although this book contains fantastic information and data about the state of the current healthcare system, it gives very little specific guidance on how to improve it other than to state the obvious; that there needs to be a way to judge the value of healthcare for the patient per dollar spent, and utilize that information to improve competition. A much more novel approach to reforming healthcare is found through the Innovator's Prescription for Change, which outlines specific, step-by-step methods to achieve a measurable value for patients while improving access and lowering costs. For those who are looking to understand the current healthcare system to a greater degree, and who are wondering where the healthcare system will take us in 20+ years, the Innovator's Prescription for Change is a fantastic read."
2,Good try,As an avid follower of this space I was excited to see Michael Porter write on the topic. The topic is too wide and I was wondering how much time did Michael Porter spend on studying the field before transposing his competition oriented theory onto healthcare.I was bit disappointed because when I saw the content I knew he didn't study is well enough. Take this for example on page 48- 'Most patients are actively discouraged from seeking and securing the best value care.'Reality is most patients do not seek best value. This coming from a third pary insurer who put up wbesite to compare prices. Insured members just don't use it. Most patients wouldn't be able to distuingish valuable care from punctuality of doctor or courtesy of office staff.Dr.Porter assumed that consumers and supplier behavior is similar as in other fields and has really erred over there. He really had to understand intricacies of our unspoken health beliefs to get this right.Still it's a step in right direction.
4,How sick is US Healthcare,Interesting view on the actual US healthcare and a challenging way to solve the mailaise
1,Dishonest,"This really is a great book, however, the only problem I have with it is that Jim Goll already published this book some time ago titled ""Wasted on Jesus."" Therefore, I found it pretty disappointing to get this book only to realize the he just changed the title, added one little part, and upped the price. Don't get me wrong, it's a great book, but someone is obviously trying to use Jesus to get rich."
3,Nice collection except for one lemon,"It was going great (really great) until we hit the first Hausbrandt pod. Watery, light and tasteless. All the Hausbrandt pods are the same. I wish PodMerchant would take this out of the collection.The rest of the collection is fantastic. If you are looking to sample a variety of coffee flavors before deciding to mass order the ones you like, this sampler collection is ideal. We have no favorite brands, just what suits us best for the occasion. In general, the darker wrappers seem to be the richer, heavier flavors and the lighter wrappers were lighter. That said, there are many exceptions to the rule. We liked to be surprised.Highly recommend this collection, but only if PodMerchant will be kind enough to remove the HausBrandts. Atleast 10 pods were of this brand."
1,Not great,"Although I normally grind up beans and make espresso, I bought some of these pods for when I'm in a rush to get out of the door. I have used Illy espresso pods before with great results, but these pods were a huge dissapointment. I tried six pods out of the bag when I first got the pod pack(since there is a random mix of all different types). Each cup was really poor. The pods themselves are packed very loosley, so that the espresso ends up super weak and tastes like a bad bitter cup of coffee. When I saw these I thought ""What a deal!"" You are much better off spending the extra money for the Illy, or grinding up your own beans."
5,"Great coffee, great value","I've purchased this assortment three times now and love the quality, quantity, and variety. It's an excellent value and I much prefer brewing pods vs. grounds. The consistency of the pods is so much greater than grounds (especially with low-end consumer grinders and espresso machines) and the speed and convenience make it a no-brainer. Using pods and a sampler pack like this is like trying a different coffee shop every day."
3,Decent value,"I was expecting more variety in the flavor, but all the different pods tasted quite similar. My biggest complaint is that about 1 out of every 5 pods would not produce espresso. All I got was water, even after trying to run it through the espresso machine a second time. I'll be sticking with the Espressione brand for my next purchase since the flavor and result is more consistent."
1,A Mess!!!,There is a program problem. This product is NOT for Nespresso but keeps coming up when you search for Nespresso. I had to return the products and the vendor confirmed this happens often. Can Amazon correct the misleading links??Steve S.
2,Disappointment,"The pods did not fit in my machine very good, causing water torun out of the top. Some worked that were extras out of the pack.The flavorite coffee worked fine. I love Espresso, but does notwork in my machine."
2,Not as pictured or expected.,"While there were some lovely pods in my order, I received about a dozen of the same flavor, without notice, since the podmerchant's stock had been depleted. Some of the pods had expired, as well. I got this as a gift for my boss, so you can imagine it was more than a little embarrassing... Customer service wasn't much to speak of, either. They had a ""what's the problem"" response when I expressed disappointment with the lack of variety and the expired goods, and they were always traveling, so communication was slow. I can't recommend them, unless you really don't care what you get! The quality of the espresso was hit-or-miss. Most of them were mediocre or stale, so. Caveat emptor."
3,Difficult to find right temperature,"Very easy to wash off since it's water based. I still havent figured out exactly the right temperature for this. It says hot or cold, but cold doesnt work for me and hot burns you so you have to find that warm middle. good luck."
5,ETC-straigfht up yo-core,"Times 2 $hine is by far their best album. They started this hole yo-core deal along with Dog Eat Dog and New School (check em out if possible) back in the good ole days when there wasn't no crappy yo-core out there like now. Raw energy, unmasked emotions, everything u want in some hard hittin music wit some tight rhymes sliced in2 the deal. U can't go wrong wit dis album n the rest of em. I'm origionally from northeasrtern PA n they played shows round the area alot and damn do they put on a good show. If u ever have the chance check em out. They definetly got their own sound 2 them which makes em ever better. No band I've ever heard got power, emotion, n skills like the ETC crew. The only other band I could think of that is even near ETC is maybe Ill Nino's first album or Slipknot."
1,No Talent!,"WOW IS THIS BAND ANNOYING OR WHAT! I'LL STICK TO HATEBREED, BURRIED ALIVE, THE DILLENGER ESCAPE PLAN, UNSANE, AND CANDIRIA FOR MY HARDCORE NEEDS FOR NOW! THIS IS RAP WITH BAD GUITAR. THEY SOUND LIKE THEIR READY TO TOUR WITH LIMP BIZKIT!"
3,An excellent source for Family Lore,"MacLysaght was the the Cheif Herald of Ireland during the 40's and so has an intimant knownledge of what he writes. He covers about 300 Irish families and goes into breif details as to what county they originated in, the clans they belonged to, and the original Gaelic spelling. If you are into Irish history or Genealogy, it should be on your shelf."
5,Great for your money!,"""The Shoes are amazing. They look great and they are comfortable. My only advice is Please order your shoes at least a size bigger. They run small."
1,mine didn't run small,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided to order these shoes for my daughter. They DID NOT run small, so the size larger that I ordered was too big. Now I have to return them, and there isn't time to wait for a new pair before her show opens. Other than the size and inconvenience, they seem to be nice shoes. She didn't wear them, though."
1,Poor Design,"These clippers cut very well but the curved design of the base and the lever make holding them very uncomfortable. Your fingers want to keep sliding toward the cutting edge. Basically, it's a poor design and I would not recommend them. Instead, spend less money and get those without the curved based and lever."
4,I am very Disappointed,"I bought the collection of dvd's just for some episodes about raptors. Guess what? You can find all the most fascinating episodes with velociraptors and ortodones only on the VHS. I was like WTF? Can't they publish those series on dvd? HELLOO! I am the fan of the ''PALEOWORLD''. BUT we don't use VHS's anymore. Publish those series on DVD or blue-ray! PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!Update:I bought this NOT EVEN of the collection, on August 31, 2008. Now it is February 2011. They did not bother to update the DVD collection and add the rest of the missing episodes. MORE THAN HALF OF THE COLLECTION IS MISSING!!! Shame on you all! I love ''Paleoworld'' and I hate this little of the dvd collection."
4,Not my father's jazz.,"My father has been a fan of jazz all of his life. I have yet to expose him to this album for fear of him disowning me. Ether Bunny, the side project of Daniel Vahnke of the industrial band Vampire Rodents, is a bouillabaisse of jazz samples assembled over programmed drum beats. The results are surprising. The music is kind of difficult to put into words. It has some of the basic concepts of jazz, but it lacks the improvisational aspects, replacing them with the structure of industrial, hip hop, and other forms of dance music. The artwork and song titles are indicative of the demented children's music idiom that Daniel Vahnke also brings into a lot of Vampire Rodents' music. Ether Bunny is highly entertaining in a weird fashion and probably not for everyone. This may appeal to fans of industrial or acid jazz music...or not. Let's just say that if you like the samples provided, then you would probably enjoy the whole album."
5,Oddly amazing,"When I picked this up, I was expecting something heavy and altogether strange. I got the altogether strange. The album is funky and humerous. It is also nice to be able to pick out some of the key samples in some of the songs, like Yoko Kanno & the Seatbelts ""Tank!"" in one song and a little bit of the inspector gadget theme. Altogether, this is a fun and energizing album. Jazzy with an industrial feel. Very different, but its uniqueness makes it an excellent addition to a music repitoire."
4,All things ancient Egypt,"these stencils are small (images are 2-3"" square), but we have used them repeatedly for hours of ""art fun"". My 6 year old grandson is fascinated by stories of ancient Egypt, and these have worked for everything from simple coloring projects to inventing and illustrating his own stories about Egypt. lots of return on a small investment, but recommend they are used with other Egyptian themed items."
4,Good but needs a second look!!!,"They were good shoes. I love Adidas but they shoes were not to comfortable. I might have thought and should of thought about it twice before I purchased them, but good in style and very light."
4,The Bhagavad-Gita Galaxy Books by Robert Charles Zaehner,Robert Charles Zaehner does a nice job of translating the Sanskrit text. It's an in depth English translation.
1,Not very good,"I have seen better examples of witch- and mage-craft in movies like The Craft, and shows like Charmed. The episodes are too short, and there are too many crammed together on one DVD. I would recommend you get the book ""Ceremonial Magic & The Power of Evocation"" by Joseph Lisiewski, PhD instead."
5,LOVE THIS PEN!,This is the nicest pen I've used. Cross does it again! It fits well and writes beautifully!
4,"Great technicality, weak lyrics...","Musically, this album is excellent. The pace changes, the time signatures, everything about this album creates a great technical hardcore/metalcore cd. However my only complaint is that the lyrics are very, very weak. The rhyming sounds forced and the topics cover typical areas that Marilyn Manson would write about.So if you are a fan of technical hardcore and metalcore and can get past decent vocals and mediocre lyrics, you will definitely appreciate Cult Classic."
3,Disappointed,"I'm not knowledgeable enough to be able use this book, as there are no illustrations. I need some drawings to help identify the plants."
5,The Gary Moore Experience,"Firmly blues based...but make no mistake, this is maximum hard rock of the first order. Gary has strapped the Strat back on and has formed a true power trio that owes more to Hendrix, Trower and Stevie Ray than any of the ""Kings""( BB, Albert and Freddie). Fans of ""Still Got The Blues"" hoping for something more in that vein are going to have to wait a bit longer. This disc is raw, blistering, earthy, albeit bluesy rock and roll as only Gary can do it. On ""Back To The Blues"" you could kind of get an inkling as to where some of this was coming from, but Gary is such an incredible virtuoso that you never really know what direction he's going to head in. This disc takes the seeds of Hendrix's genius to its full fruition by one of the only people on the planet talented enough to pick up on wholly original musical ideas and run with them.My hat is also off to the awesome rhythm section of Cass and Darrin who inject a nice burst of energy to compliment all the guitar pyrotechnics."
4,Gary Moore is Still Rocking his Dirty Fingers,this CD is full of true gary moore'isms. strong rock blues here by one of the best in the business. been in love with gary moore's playing since 1985. if you really like robin trower you'll be surprised at how these two paths have crossed now. gary seems to be using a Strat for most of the album along with fairly extensive use of the Wah Wah...so with the blues based songs here you can't help but draw a parallel. if you are looking for another straight blues standard album that Gary just blows off the map...think twice. but you have always enjoyed Gary's writing and playing then you will like this album.
2,"""Scars""? Another step back!","Gary Moore has become one of the great rock/electric blues guitarists of all time. The man can play that Les Paul!! But, with the release of ""Scars"" it seems that Gary is trying to please the grunge generation or whatever ""weird rock"" is called today! Gary can really sing, but on this album he's pretending again? His singing sounds pathetic! The guitar work is almost great, but not 100% up to par. This cd makes one to believe that Gary Moore has run out of ideas? I'd be in favor of an instrumental album next!"
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"Gary has out done himself again. The first 4 songs are hard rock songs with a blues twist, the Guitar on ""Rectify"" is Godly and then the album mellows a little with song 5. After that he plays with your mind on 6 & 7 playing a tasteful tribute to Stevie Ray and Jimi. ""My baby"" for Stevie Ray and ""World on Confusion"" for Jimi which will remind you of ""Manic Depression"" Song 8 ""Ball&Chain;"" is just a great 12 minute jam session. 9 and 10 are cool also. It's just to bad the U.S. does not know how great Gary is. I wish I could give it ten stars. Just as great is John Sykes Just proving that Thin Lizzy will always remain the greatest Guitar Band ever.BUY IT!!!"
3,stevie ray vaughan meets hendrix,"i first was not so into the scars cd at first but after a few lsiten i enjoy it, years between his days with thin lizzy and his great rock cds in the early 80""s it took awhile to get used to him not playing the plays. the cds contains guitar work that would fit on any hendrix or srv cd.best cut is ball and chain a slow 12 minute blues jam"
1,AAARGH!!!!,"Wow, I traded this CD for a Son Volt CD the next day after listening to it. IMHO, This CD is unlistenable. I am a very open minded listener,(See Son Volt,I have several Gary Moore CDs).This CD has no redeeming qualities. I am all for updating your sound but the music has to fit, and frankly Gary's voice does not fit this. Remember, melody, rythm, and musicianship still count for a lot of people."
4,Solid!Take a listen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"While not my favorite's of Jordan it's a fine LP with a great band consisting of Tommy Flanagan,Bill Lee,and Grady Tate.Great playing by especially Jordan.Take a Listen..............."
3,"For the money, it could be better","The pull down menus are pretty limited for the childs favorite animals, interests, etc. For family/friends names, they have a wide variety of spellings of the same sounding name, even though you only hear the name. The lists are made up of mostly girls names (couldn't find Lyle). Guess I should have known, but Barbie spouts mostly Valley Girlish sentences - they could have given her more of a brain. But, my 3 1/2 hear old is amazed that Barbie knows something about her and her friends, favorite foods, etc."
1,Useless,"This is the worse product we received this entire Christmas season. For $42.99 you would expect the toy to work for at least one day... it has never worked. I replaced the batteries, but that didn't help. We used the included PC software to customize the phone for my daughter, and downloaded the information to the phone. The phone never ""calls"" her, and when she tries to play with it, the sound is either very VERY faint, or the ""conversation"" with Barbie doesn't make any sense - sometimes she just says one word and that's it."
3,Decent mixer with one major drawback.,"This is a great mixer, easy to understand and master.One major drawback is that you are unable to monitor the main output via headphones,only channel 1 & 2. This is a big drawback for DJ's who want to do a direct check of what is going out to the speakers.Other than that,not a bad mixer at all."
5,product review,"This is a good mixer, a good start if you ever want to get your feet wet. The drawback is it is only a channel mixer with no pitch changing or beat mapping/altering. A good start though."
3,Give it time,After reading the first Angela Bivens book I had high hopes for this one. For the most part the book works but there is just too much in it. The story goes off in so many directions it's like looking at a pot of spaghetti thrown against the wall. The heroine is essentially Cleopatra Jones with serious emotional issues and some of the stuff she does makes not a lick of sense but if you give this book time you'll find a pretty good read for a rainy afternoon.
3,Okay Read,I thought this book as with his last book started off slow and VERY detailed. Toward the middle of the book it picked up and started to become a good read as with his other book Sympathy for the devil. I thought the book could have been cut down by some chapters and less some of the details. One of the Chapters I had to go back and re-read to make sure I didn't miss something. Overall I will read another Angela Bivens novel by this author because I like mysteries.
2,break his pencil and steal his computer,I got about two chapters into this book before quitting in disgust. The writing is obvious and is a mix of cliches and 'product placements.' Too much detail for no purpose. Everyone is the best of everything or the worst. The characters are caricatures. This is blaxploitation writing.
1,Poor construction,"Made in Taiwan, very poorly sewn, lasted only 3 months outdoors despite being brought down in winds over 40MPH. Will look elsewhere for replacement."
4,Good flag for indoors,Flag fits exactly what I desired... an indoor decoration. Not sure if it would last outside for very long. Thin material but gets the job done for the price!!
4,Good overview,I purchased this tutorial prior to my purchase of the DR-880. I used it as a review of the DR-880 and it did influence my choice.
2,Disappointed,This reprint is readable but contains a lot of underlining and other notations. It seems that the original could have been cleaned up somewhat before reprinting. Nabu Press warns of the imperfections but they appear to me to be one of the worst reprint services outside of OCR reprints in total.
3,A beautifully written but plodding novel,"Green Mansions starts off well, and the story picks up in the final third of the book, but in between the narrative falters to the point that I was tempted to abandon the book, something which I don't often do. The protagonist, Abel, is not particularly likable -- which I don't believe was the author's intent -- and even allowing for the time period in which the book was written, Abel displays a surprising degree of condescension towards the natives and white men alike on whose hospitality he often depends. My general dislike for Abel made Green Mansions all the more difficult to stick with through its protracted longueur. The religious/eco-mystical aspects of the novel, however, are intriguing, and the writing is lush and evocative. I don't regret the time invested in reading Green Mansions, but it's extremely unlikely that I'll ever feel a need to revisit the book."
4,Romantic Naturalism,"Hudson, a noted naturalist during the Romantic/Victorian periods, grew up in the wild Pampas, and this book reflects a fascination with nature that most likely began during his childhood. Themes of civilzation vs. savagery and the untouched beauty of the tropics vs. development are found throughout Green Mansions, but these issues are encased in a love story that holds notes of mystery, fantasy, and romanticism.While the novel provides a good introduction to the naturalist writings of this period (and a much easier read than most of the more scientific prose being written at the time), I thought that the ending was not as developed as the rest of the book, in addition to being highly unsatisfying. The novel does, however, offer wonderful descriptions of the wild forests of the region, and develops fantastical characters, particularly in the case of Rima, the primary female character."
3,"Hmmm, i seem to disagrreee",i think this book was extremly boring and non-exciting. for younger kids you will not be able to get a good pictue in your head of what is going on.
1,"Don't waste your time, love or money.","I took a UCLA extension class in the early '80s called ""Sneak Previews"" which was self explanatory: it was essentially viewing movies before they were released to the general public. This was one of them, and it turned out to be one of the biggest pieces of cinematic crap I have ever had the dishonor of sitting through. Ornella Muti is gorgeous as all-get-out, but she cannot act to save her life, at least in this stinker. The fact that this person is the only thing I can remember about this movie says it all. If it ever turns up on TV, change the channel, or if you can't, run like hell."
4,Cosmic Author Rip-Off,"Readers of ""To Marry Medusa"" (or ""The Cosmic Rape"" in its longer version) may be interested to learn that in chapter 63 of Kurt Vonnegut's last novel, ""Timequake"" (1997) a speech given to the character Kilgore Trout (Vonnegut's parody version of Theodore Sturgeon) was clearly borrowed from Chapter 29 of ""To Marry Medusa"" - a meditation on how the human eye and mind can travel from star to star faster than light."
2,Confusing,"This book served to utterly confuse me. My two favorite subjects are politics and sci-fi, but this book still seemed to dissapoint me. All along the beginning it seemed as if there were information that Anthony just wanted us to already know. If you don't think exactly like the author you'll probably get lost.I got the basic point of what was happening, but didn't understand everything until the last 30 pages of the book. It's an okay book if you really try to follow it, but I personally didn't like it."
3,Good introduction to the life of WH Harrison.,"I enjoyed this book. The majority of the book focuses on WHH's experience as Govenor of Indiana Territory, and as a commander in the war of 1812. The book was written in the 1930's. As is typical of many biographies of its era, little attention is paid to Harrison's family or his personal life. Some may find that a refreshing change from the psychologically based biographies of today. Others may feel that an important facet is missing."
1,Painful reading,"Verbose, cumbersome, and hardly readable. Cleaves, like many authors of this period, must have felt compelled to overwrite this work so that it would appear ""scholarly"" to his contemporary readers. We have a new name for it in the 21st century: Bad. He repeatedly makes reference to characters not previously introduced. After page 200 or so he frequently lapses into what can best be described as listing, in no particular order, strings of otherwise unrelated facts. The only reason to read this book is that there are few if any complete biographies of Harrison's life available, so we must do with what we have. I can only hope that someone will produce a well written treatment of this very interesting figure in the future."
4,The trouble with American Students,"Hello people, basically i am looking for reviews of books. I wanted to find reviews so i could use them and say ive read this book. I just thought i would leave this ""review"" telling people who actually read this book to write reviews. If others, like me, have come here i would suggset you try www.sparknotes.com or www.pinkmonkey.com! Good luck"
1,It's 2006 - time to retire these DVD's,"It's unfortunate that this DVD series of the human body did not meet my expectations. Indeed, I would have to say that it was a great disappointment.What need to be brought to the attention of the consumer is that these series are very old and are not in any way a very detailed program. It's unfortunate that these series are still on the market, especially for a whooping $150.00. These DVD's are very poor in digital quality and sound. The narrators are boring and learning the human body is a bore, using this collection.It's a 1994 production with a price tag of 2006. Rip off? I think so.If this collection of DVD's were sold for $40 I would have to rate it 5 stars. The human body is very interesting indeed, but on these DVD's it makes the body a body boring organism to learn about.Save your money.. I'm so upset that I wasted my money on this."
4,"JOSEPH LOSEY, OPUS 13","The film handles the same theme -obsessive and destructive love- thanThe Gypsy And The Gentleman, a film Joseph Losey directed four years earlier. As it is, the movie is still captivating. Highly recommended."
5,Big coffee mugs!,"I ordered these large coffee mugs to match my current pottery. They arrived quickly with no breakage, which some people had voiced a concern about. I had previously ordered the smaller mugs by mistake. I am pleased to have these additional mugs."
5,I LOVE these mugs!,"I looked for several months for the perfect set of coffee mugs, and finally found these on Amazon. The color is rich; the design in classy but not overwhelming; the handles are sturdy; the thickness of the mug itself feels strong and durable; and they actually hold more liquid than they appear to. I can't say enough about these. I highly recommend then!"
1,Had to return,"Gold mugs arrived broken, had to return. Disappointed because they were a nice size mug in a color and style I liked."
2,horrible packing,"I received a set as a gift and when they arrived half were broken. Amazon did a great job sending me out a replacement set with two day shipping, problem was half of those were broken. I had to sift through to get a complete set."
2,Poor packing,These mugs are nice but they are packaged poorly and 2 out of 6 were broken to pieces. Not worth sending them back.
1,"really slow transfers, try something else","it does work, but its painfully slow. Ive got a 4gb card and it took hours to fill it up. In my opinion, i dont think it could be any slower."
3,The art is beautiful but the book is short on inspiration,"Perhaps it is the ""let's get it all in here"" mentality of this book of Michael Leonard's drawings that diminishes the overall impact of what could be an elegant homage to a fine artist. Or perhaps it is the scale of reproductions and quality of transfer that makes this inherently tender book seem sterile. But past these deficiencies there is much to savour. Leonard draws beautifully, celebrating the male form in his own vision of honesty of observation that leads to sensually satisfying images. He has been drawing and painting the male figure for years now and few can match his softly lighted men changing and stretching. Others in his class include Wade Reynolds, Paul Cadmus, Charles Beauchamp and Claudio Bravo - each with his signature style making it patently obvious that the time to return to the male nude has finally arrived."
3,"The ""RCA Indoor Amplified Tv Antenna"" is THE ONE!!","I purchased this Winegard antenna and it was not even as good as my 12Dollar RCA ANT200B rabbit ears - which is exceptional by the way. I had already tried theAntennas Direct DB2 Multi Directional HDTV Antennawhich was not as good as the Winegard.I finally decided to buy an updated version of my RCA, made by the same Thomson manufacturer, and so purchased the RCA ANT525 and ... JACKPOT!!See my review of it here:RCA Indoor Amplified Tv Antenna!!! THIS IS THE ONE, AMIGOS !!!"
2,"TV antenna, Solid Signal? Not so much!","Clean lines, easy connect to my unused Directv post and in the right location....but, does not really grab the signal like I expected. No big deal, creates alot of wire to get to the head unit, better off with a simple inside antenna that will do just as good, or better a job."
4,better than my previous antenna,"I had a $40 Terk, the ""fishbone"" type. This cost twice as much - but is it twice as good? I dont think so. Was it worth it? I dont know... maybe. I like it well enough to keep it, but if I'd known it was only maybe 1/3rd better - I dont know if I would have paid $80 for it. I ended up putting a wire thru the wall and mounting it in the garage to make it as good as it currently is. If I find myself discontented enough after a couple more weeks I think I'll get a longer cable and try the attic."
2,Very limited by line of sight to transmission towers,"After trying just about every antenna available locally I broke down and ordered the Winegard SS-1000 Squareshooter in hopes of receiving a better signal by moving my antenna outdoors. Unfortunately I do not have the ability to gain line of sight to the transmission towers and get only one of more than 6 stations available locally and the one station is not reliable. Not worth the money for me, but if you have line of sight it may be a good choice for you."
5,Essential,"An intense epic that is in touch with all human desires. An incredible read, give it a chance. Disregard the overly-religious folks who don't like the tawdry side - sorry folks, that's life in pre-politically correct America."
3,"Pretty good, but somewhat dissapointed","Had bought this for around 100 dollars, has removable cloth/canvas, and it a good size. The disappointing part is that it does indent very easy, so frequent flipping over is a necessity. At 100 dollars, there are many other options around to look for. Would not exactly recommend this item."
1,$42 total at your local Costco,"It doesn't show up on the Costco website (item number 354567) but you can get a 77""x36"" Hide-A-Bed for $42. They've carried this item in many colors for years. Look in the camping section by the tents."
1,trifold mat,"the seller was fine in their shipping, but the item was cheaply made and way overpriced for that material.i do not recommend this item. Ikea has a far better range of such items."
3,OK,Not sure its waterproof and thickness does not allow it to fit under a regular height bed. Otherwise its fine.
5,Great quality,I ordered this for my daughters camping trip. We've also using it for overnight guests. Stores easily in the closet.
1,Toxic!!! Alergic!!!,"This product is very toxic, i even dont used it and cause me allergic, burn my eyes, ears & nose... Like crazy!!!I am trying to return the item.It has to be remove from amazon and for the market!!!"
4,"It gets the job done, hard though.","I bought this mat to use in my truck bed when I go camping in my Sportz TruckTent. It works well enough, but man is it ever hard. I guess it has to be because it's only 3 inches thick. It's better than sleeping on the bare truck bed, better than sleeping on the ground, better than my air mattress because it won't pop, but I'll need to get a soft pad for the top of it to get a good nights sleep."
3,really nice bu FIRMt,"THis pad is nicely made, big. However, beware, it is REALLY FIRM! I like firm beds but after the first night, I felt like I woke up with bruises! Second night better tho. This thing is too big to return so I am thinking of getting a thick mattress pad to solve the problem."
1,Unusable as a bed,"Do not buy this if the intended use is to sleep on it. IT IS HARD AS A ROCK. I envisioned some kind of mattress foam when I was purchasing this, but this thing is made of something that feels like styrofoam. I would not sleep on it, nor would I ever make my guests sleep on something like this."
2,"Pricey, not worth it.","I bought this in August 2009. It's firm but works for me as my back hurts in soft cushion. It doesn't have a carry bag and the sheet can not be replaced easily as it's stitched. I don't have a problem with the smell. However, for the material used, it's not worth it. You can get this in costco for under $50, and yet with a carry bag and better material. Too late when I saw it in nearby costco (CA)."
4,Nice Floor Mat,This is a nice floor mat. I wanted something thick to put on the floor for exercising to make it easier for my neck and back as well as for getting up on my knees prior to getting up from the floor. It also works great as a mattress for the Grandkids when they come for a sleepover. I used it on top of my Granddaughter's twin bed and it was quite comfortable. I have dogs and cats so the material covering this mat could get pretty hairy so I bought an inexpensive zippered twin size mattress cover and I can still fold the mat for storage (just can't use the handles for carrying). I think I need to buy another one so all my Grandkids will have a place to sleep once the twins grow out of their cribs! This is a better investment than buying twin size beds that will take up space.
5,A great creepy album.,I have always really enjoyed this album. It is very creepy and perfect to play in the background while I work on art projects. Great soundtrack too for Goth or Steampunk crowd to play in the background of a party or art show.
1,AWFUL,"This is just a weird album. It's not weird to the point where you're thinking to yourself ""How does this guy do it?"". Actually it's quite cheesy. This is the type of stuff I would play outside of my house on halloween or something. If you like long drawn out music that a serial killer hears in his head then buy this. If you're not sure just play alot of low notes with different effects on your casio at home and throw some samples in their and see if you like it. If so then buy it."
2,Don't bother.,Don't waste your money. There's not much content here and what it's poorly organized and written. You can get much better info on the Internet for free.
3,A gem of a book -- a rare find.,"I've read through this book a number of times. It is full of many interesting morsels of information -- and, of course, it is poorly researched. So many of the claims and stories in this book need to be researched by the authors themselves (I've actually had to do some of the research myself). But give Dongo credit for getting this information into the public realm.It's a New Age-metaphysical type of book, so be warned."
3,Solo 2 ...that was not a ...Solo 2,I like Solo 2 and I have owned one good 5 or 6 years. That was important because what Amazon sent me was not a Solo 2 but small less expensive unit called a Solo. After some easy going bargaining we settled on a small refund and I kept the Solo. Lesson learned...Don't assume what you order is what you will receive. Know the product well enough before you buy to be sure it what you think it is. Caveat emptor!
1,Doesn't cover ODBC 3.5 specification completely.,"Although the author notes this book doesn't contain any Unicode issue, there are many incorrect descriptions regarding the text data type and missing information about ODBC 3.5 new features. For example, column size of data may represent the length of data in characters in case the data is text, while this book describe explicitly ""in bytes"". The meanings are totally different especially when you handle non-Latin text data. I should recommend the serious user/developer to get Microsoft official documents and I should say this book is not based on ODBC 3.5, rather, ODBC 3.0."
1,Strictly a reference book.,The text does not follow any tutorial standard or style. It is a series of essays followed by detailed examples and verbose documentation. Some thought should have gone into the presentation.
5,A good book,"I am a person of learning by example. I don't use all functions of ODBC, but I use whatever I need for my project. For every function I need, there is an example in this book for me to understand. Actually, I learn ODBC from this book"
4,Bought as a gift for my wife...,"My wife is interested in geology, and since we live in Idaho, thought she should have a copy! She had seen it years before at our local library. It's full of field trips, although they are some what dated, and we actually used some of them to find rocks and minerals...she loves it and now she has her own copy! I highly recommend it for Idaho rock hounds...the field trips are interesting and allow you to not only find rock, gems, and mineral, but to see the wonderful Idaho scenery as you search!"
1,Dont Trust Amazon Reviews,"I have bought a dozen or so 'scary' movies like this one on the advice on Amazon reviewers. This movie got 4.5 stars for over 100 reviews - it seemed like a safe bet. This movie was yet another disappointing 80s cheapo non-scary pre-teen movie. This would get a PG rating by today's standards. Frankly, I have stopped reading Amazon's movie reviews as too 'positive.' Skip this movie unless you're 11 years old!"
2,bad vhs,"We were really disappointed with the quality of this purchase but we kinda felt like we would have been. The movie flips and rolls, but it is an older movie Thank you"
5,Very cool spooky film,"I heard from a lot of people that this was a very good movie, so I bought my copy. This movie is an instant classic. I really enjoyed this movie. There is just something very spooky about scarecrows. This movie is done very well and perfect for the Halloween season. This is one that I will watch over and over again."
4,night of the scarecrow,i saw this movie about 10 years ago and liked it.have been searching for it for awhile. if you likescarey movies this is the one to watch.
5,WHY?? is this film not on DVD in the U.S.??,"Still holds up after all these years! Saw this as a kid and loved it, recently bought a used copy on VHS and watched it again. Just as good as it was the first go round. Found this film on ebay on DVD; I believe it was produced in another country. Hope it's not just a VHS transfer. You won't be disappointed with this film. Shows what good writing and directing can do for you. TV movies ain't what they used to be."
3,O.K. horror flick,"I was really expecting a scary horror movie based on all the Amazon reviews. The movie really didnt shock or frighten me, but the story was passable . On a scale of 1 to 10----- I would rate it a 7. Other movies were more scary."
2,Very poor quality,"We have loved this movie since we first saw it in 1981. We taped it years ago on our VCR (with commercials) and got a better result than this DVD!!! I have purchased this movie on VHS, and TWICE on DVD and the quality of all of them is compromised by skipping, lines through the picture, etc. How hard is it to make a decent DVD from a movie??? I am terribly disappointed!"
5,DNOTS,"I was very pleased with this item. I enjoy different genres of movies but am a complete geek for horror and the macabre. I wasn't fortunate enough to catch this little gem when it first premiered (I was about 6), but was pleasantly surprised when I got the opportunity upon it's release on dvd. Not for everyone, especially those who fall for the slew of crap that passes for horror in Hollywood these days."
2,terrible recording,"I liked Listen and Learn French a lot, even though the audio level was too low, but for the German one it's ridiculous. It's the first time I've ever had to turn the volume in my car stereo all the way up to 10. The audio was so bassy that I also had to turn the treble way up, and then I can hear hiss and the voices are distorted. I assume they took some worn-out old language learning cassettes and made these CDs from those instead of seeking out the master tapes. It's a shame, because they do a good job of explaining key phrases for travelling in a foreign country."
1,Custom Brackets BAD Service,"Custom Brackets has very por customer service, they will promise to deliver you item and then you never get it and they won't answer the phone or return messages. Stay away from buying anything made by Custom Brackets!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Very nice product! IT PLAYS MP3,"It's a wonderful Stereo System.Plays MP3, even amazon saying it don't play.Should have a better remote control... and some more buttons on the system, you can only pause a CD on the remote control.Sould have a skip for folder on MP3 cd's and more characters to display the MP3 info.Just details to be perfect!"
5,Manchu,"This is a great book the let people to know that Manchu still exists, because most of people had been unknown about China was named Manchu, it really named Manchu. It shows the social life style of the Manchus, the power of kingdom, which is never going to forget about the wealthy lives in Manchu, what is forbidden city really means. Forbidden City is a heaven, it is the most beautiful place to live in. It is magnificent, no where could compare with Forbidden City. Kingdom life is the best!China should changed the name back to ""Manchu"" Qing Dynatsy is great!!!"
5,A reliable and affordable flash,"I bought this vivitar 285hv flash for off-camera lighting, and it worked great with the Pt-04 wireless flash trigger set I have. The SB-600 I have will go into standby mode in a minute or two if I don't use it. This Vivitar flash won't, and that's a good thing because I don't have to wake it up. It is always up and ready to be fired. It may use more power that way, but I don't care since I have a lot of rechargeable AA batteries ready. Great flash !!!"
2,High Voltage did Not Work on Mine Either,"I have also had disappointments with the newly manufactured 285. I purchased two brand new. The first one did not work with my turbo pack, and the second one worked with the turbo pack when I tested it, but failed at a gig. Very frustrating. I returned both for a refund. From what I understand is the new models are now made in China under the brand name Vivitar, and are no longer a Japanese product.Chris Maness Photography"
5,"Look cheap plastic, but works very well","It looks like cheap old plastic, but works very well, I also bought a chinese wireless trigger on ebay, you can find it on amazon too, searching for ""PT-04 4"" it works great for strobist, you can control light and it is strong, Don't left batteries on its compartment they will be discharged."
4,cheap and reliable,"This is an awesome vintage flash for today's digital SLR's. I like that it is compatible with my Nikon D-80. The only thing I wish it had was a swivel-head. But with a hot-shoe cable for off-camera flash, it doesn't really matter."
4,gets the job done,I've had this flash about a month now. I've been pretty happy with it and it does everything I need to do with an off camera flash. Great price.
4,Great powerfull flash,"Hey this flash it is so powerfull, it is good to use to make jobs outside, and it is not heavy. you can use on the Canon Rebel XS,(1000D).also you can buy an extra battery holder, and four AAA to AA battery holder converter, and make some wiring and use an external battery 6vdc(lead acid) and have a better recicling times, like 6 seconds using the full power of the flash against the 12 with the normal four AA batteries. and with the lowest power you can shot continously like 20 times without problems. with this add, this flash can work all the night and take more than 1000 shots.cons. If you need to take fast pictures, with it mounted on the camera shoe, you need to adjust it every time , because it does not have TTL circuit, and you can burn the pictures. and for this reason it is better to buy the TTL flash of your camera to avoid this kind of situation on fast moments taking pictures, like the kiss on the wedding ceremony.but for the rest it is a good flash.i do recomend it"
1,"Stay away, this is not your father's Vivitar","Vivitar used to be the go-to workhorse for photographers, but no more. Now they are made in China and prone to high failure. The one that I bought 1 year ago made a snapping and crackling sound the other day and then refused to fire after that. Efforts to contact the number on the warranty were fruitless; the company has gone out of business and will not service its flashes. If you really want an old-school Vivi that won't fail, get a 283 made in Japan off of Ebay."
2,It flashes but very fragile,It's reasonably powerful but I broke the hot shoe mount today. It works well as long as you take care of it but it is a little too fragile for my needs.
1,"Good flash, but doen't last long","The flash is great when new, easy to understand and use, but dies after 4-5 months. I wouldn't mind getting another one, if they sold it for $10, which is, what the product is really worth."
5,Lots of light for a little money.,"As an amateur photographer I don't like to spend a lot of money on gear, but I wanted to have some options other than available and on-camera flash. The 285HV was exactly what I needed. The amount of light this puts out is amazing. I've used it off-camera in full sunlight with great results. Fast recycle, reliable, powerful, inexpensive."
5,great flash,All the good reviews you've read about this flash are 100% true. I can find no fault in this flash. I love using manual flash so this flash is perfect and gets the job done. I'm only two years into photography and with my limited experience I was able to figure out the calculator on the side of the flash. If anything it's a nice extra inexpensive flash to have in your gear.I bought some 12x12 gels and cut them down to wallet size (3.5in x 2in) and they fit perfect in the slot in the side of the flash head. This makes it perfect for lighting up a white wall behind your subject with cool colors.
5,VIVITAR 285HV,"This is a well balanced product (cost/quality)I had purchased one before and I drooped it and dosen`t work... I mean It's a delicated product but If you take care of it, you will have a good flash to count with.This last flash I ordered was on time and in perfect conditions, so I can recomend it :)"
5,Cost Effective Monster Flash,This is a very PowerFul Flash Unit. Hook it with a Wireless Trigger and Receiver and you are set to take awesome Photographs.I bought 4 of these and just spent $300. Best Bang for the Least Buck.
4,works great with the wein peanut triggered by 580EXII on 5d mark 2,"the plastics look cheap, OK construction. I got 2 of these intended to have them working as external flash and triggered by 580EX II. The wein peanut seems working well, as matter of fact it work really well when triggered by 580EXII on ETTL or manual mode, never missed one single shot yet. Overall it's a good buy."
4,Great Flashes,"I bought these as an inexpensive alternative to the Nikon flashes and I'm very happy with them. I have an SB600 that after 2 weeks of use and a light drop of less than 1 foot, had to go back to Nikon for a $120 repair. These Vivitars have been on my umbrella stands when they've blown over, hit the ground and come right back up to fire. I think for the $90 cost, you get a good amount of power with very good build quality. I only wish the recycle time was a bit faster, and that they had a 1/32 power, or even 1/8 power but they're analog at it's finest and I'm glad I got them."
4,Excellent,I used my flash in a wedding this weekend and it worked very well. It has a longer recycle time than I would ideally like but it still is really neat.
1,Pretty good but fragile and stopped working,I bought two of these flashes about a year ago. The first stopped working after about 5 months. Just wouldn't fire the flash. I probably used it less that 300 times. The second one stopped working about 12 months after I bought it. It let out a smell like burnt electronics and won't fire. Waste of money.
3,grt service,"excellent delivery service, only prob was ""no batt incl"". (none promised). looking forward to getting some really good vacation pictures. I also needed to download an instruction manual."
1,Didn't work with Pentax K10D,"The camera would not recognize it. It's not pretty, but It's a HUGELY powerful flash. Sadly, it is useless to me in its current configuration."
1,Lousy company - don't buy,"I have had one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had with this company - I bought a screen protector from office depot, the card that came with it to spread the cover ended up scratching it to hell. Worst of all I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE, SPENT 30 min talking with some incompetent woman who didnt speak English nor did she know the products. . After talking with a supervisor he said he would send me a new protector WHICH HAS NEVER COME!!!! This is a lousy company, lousy products, and a bunch of liars."
3,probably my last Vivitar,"As a professional photographer for over 30 years, I've owned several Vivitar 285's. I like them because they let me control the flash a little more than more current models (although I own some of the newer models and brands as well). This last Vivitar 285 I just got doesn't seem to be quite as well made as some I've owned previously. The flash as a whole seems to be made of a cheaper plastic and not as tightly made. Also, the flash cord that came with it didn't work. This will probably be the last of this model I will buy."
3,Good entry level flash units,"Actually I bought two of these units as a result of a 7 floor free fall suffered by my 480 Canon Speedlight and the Vivitars became a good option to grow my lighting system. I have used them a few and my first insights are: they are bulky - something around 20% bigger compared to Canon -, forget any fancy electronic frills it is all plastic controls. The sync cable plug is quite loose so using a wired system could not be the best option.On the good end i can say that they have a good recycling time, are easy to use and the corrector gel holder -which is named as diffusor holder in the manual- are nice features.Bottomline: as an amateur photographer on a thight budget and working in manual mode these buddies are a good option in terms of development & price but they are cheap all the way. If you are looking for something sophisticated to shoot TTL just look somewhere else."
2,Rechargeables + 285 = sadness,"Great flash. Bright output, cheap, retro style and size, fantastic pop sound.I made the mistake of using Duracell rechargeable AA batteries and things started going downhill. It would take a few tries to get it to turn on and about three days of using those batteries, it would not turn on for the life of me... Not sure why this is but there is a note in the manual cautioning not to use rechargeable batteries. I hate buying new batteries though.I really wish it still worked but I guess it was warning me."
5,What Every Parent Should Buy for their Children.,"This beautifully written book by the famous Irish poet should be read by, or to, every child to give them an introduction to the most important work (Not including Religion) ever composed.The story here told has inspired people of all civilisations for nearly 3,000 years. No person should be allowed reach adulthood without having experienced some aspects of Greek classical civilisation and these action-packed tales of heroism, humanity, weakness, tragedy and joy are a great starting-point. A sampling of the stories of the Iliad, Odyssey and of other Greek myths and heroes can be the start of a lifetime of fascination."
5,Wonderfully retold story of Odysseus,"I read this book to my 7 year old, homeschooled daughter. Her children's choir is singing the story of Odysseus and this book brought the songs to life for her. She never wanted me to put it down. The language is sophisticated but she could follow the story and was entranced by it."
5,Most influential book of my childhood,"As a kid, I loved this book.As a young adult, I've gone to college and become a Classics major. Now I'm reading the Aeneid in Latin, and I've really begun to appreciate what a wonderful book this is!I have no way of judging this book's suitability for ""kids in general."" For me, though, this book instilled a love of mythology and history that has stayed with me through my life so far. I strongly suggest it!"
3,Warning: archaic language,"This is a very well-written book -- for its time. I find that the archaic language make it unsuited for reading to children. (It is filled with ""thee"", ""thou,"" ""raiment,"" etc.) I had to practically translate the conversations between the characters for my son. For example Achilles says: ""Deem'st thou I grieve for ...""I still read it to my son (with plenty of translation and paraphrasing), and he still thoroughly enjoys the Homeric epic. But I think a more contemporary rendering would have been much better."
2,Homer for Children Today!,"Ho hum--I will never get my 5th grader to read this tome--however moving the story line and imagery. It is too thick to easily add to a history block of Ancient Civilizations around the world. The language is too dated. The narrations dwarfs the action. The standard, for good youth literature today, requires writers to SHOW the meaning and NOT TELL IT.Thankfully, author Geraldine McCaughrean wrote a wonderfully telling of GILGAMESH, so I turned around and ordered her retelling of Homer's THE ILLIAD and THE ODYSSEY which is titled, ODYSSEUS.Does anyone want my copy of Padric's version. The cover art is great."
2,This book is not for a young audience.,I was looking for a book about the classic Greek tales to read with my son. Reading the other reviews I believed this book would due for my son and me. It has not been enjoyable because the vocabulary and sentence structure is beyond young children. My opinion is that it is a fine book and well written but is deceiving in its assertion that it is for children.
5,Best introduction to the classics,"I first read this book in 1971, when I was in 7th grade. I still think about it. It provided a colorful introduction to the classics. I was not surprised to see that a class of 4th graders loved it."
4,A nice representative album from the 60s,"The Marmalade may not be one of the better-known names of bands from the 60s, but they compare well with the second-tier of bands from the British Invastion - The Kinks, The Animals, The Yardbirds...This album has solid guitar work, a nice bassline, solid harmony and catchy tunes. Parts of it remind me of The Beatles for their harmony, the Stones for the guitar licks, and strangely, in some places a BJ Thomas ballad.The mood ranges from melancholy to 60s rockin without venturing into anything too extreme on either end of the spectrum. And I can't find a weak song on the album. Worth buying."
2,Marmalade,"I enjoyed this CD quite a lot. I remembered one song of theirs and several cuts were of songs that I had heard other groups perform, however, I was impressed with Marmalade's arrangement."
3,clockvomit is completely confused,"I dont know why Im bothering doing this but clockvomit mistakling thought that this whole albumn had to do with chemlab... which i doesnt seem... it's probably a compilation, but how the hell should i've never listned to it. but for god's sakes if you listen to a cd and can't even tell that there is multiple artists on a record you're straight daft (why did I waste my time writing this) ----by the way buy Eastside Milita, it's varied and strange album going from notcrappygothic to blisteringhedbangin'inudstrial - by that instead"
3,Yuan Mei - Sensualist and Gourmet,"I have not read this English translation, but twenty years ago I read the two books on which it is based, <Zi bu yu> and <Xu zi bu yu> (""What the Master did not speak of,"" and ""What the Master did not speak of, continued""). I enjoyed them so much that I set out to translate them. Both books consist of ribald little vignettes in classical Chinese. But other events intervened and I lost interest in completing my translation. I'm glad to see that someone else has completed what I did not."
3,"Not ""Babysongs"", but okay children's music","We love Hap Palmer--he's one of those classics everyone should own. ""Babysongs"" is a great album--catchy, funny, and easy for parents to listen to. ""More Babysongs"" doesn't really live up to it, in my opinion. The songs are okay, but some don't seem as appropriate for younger children. Some of the songs are too long and have some annoying sound effects, too. (For example, the jarring hammering in one song would wake a sleeping infant!). It would probably be more suited to preschoolers."
1,Needle Sticks,"The direction needle hangs up on clinometer needle. Can't be sure which way is north.Make sure you read the fine print on this item ... ""Special Shipping Information: This item cannot be returned""..."
3,Why?,"Okay, that is not an ending. Hisoka and Tatsumi weren't even reunited. I haven't read this series since the 11th one came out, and I've been wondering where the 12th one is. Why did the mangaka stop writing it? She can't just leave us hanging like that! I don't have much else to say since it's been so long, but...seriously!"
5,This was a really great movie,The movie was excellent. The story line was really great with historically correct. This is a must have movie.
2,Poor Acting,"I was excited about this movie when i purchased it. The setting for the story seemed like a good idea, and the action scenes had been compared to 300. The action scenes did turn out to be decent, so if thats all you want then you should be pleased. It gets two stars because the dialogue is terrible, and the acting isnt much better. Some of the dialogue in the movie is so horrible its comical. Not a good thing for a serious action movie."
4,A suprisingly excellent movie,"There are many things to like about pathfinder. The Cinematography, the clever script, that sometimes is very cliche, yet very unique in others. The acting by both vikings and indians alike. But in the end, most will like it as a fun sword movie. I don't know why we get so few sword movies that aren't huge epics, maybe people don't want to put in the money for only a limited gain, or because of laziness in coming up with unique ways to make a sword movie. This one stands above most others, belonging with conan, highlander, etc. as excellent sword flicks that are tons of fun. I very much enjoyed this movie and was thrilled to be lucky enough to see it in a glut of giant hyped movies this year. give it a try."
3,This one died by the sword,"The trailers for Pathfinder appeared promising and led me to believe it could be just as good as the also recent historical action movie, 300. Sadly, this movie is a disappointment. It had potential and could have been a lot better if a few things were different.The action/fight scenes are the best things going for Pathfinder, and they're fairly decent, but they're not good enough to carry the movie on their back. The wilderness landscapes are also appealing to the eye, but the lack of good dialogue and the presence of a predictable story (and hero) contribute to the downfall of this disappointment."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"This movie was very dark and violent. Not for the faint of heart and not for a younger audience. The background in the movie was cold, harsh, and in shadow. This movie left an impression but not the one I wanted. Here's to a better script not cast in so much hate and violence."
4,Action and Violence Galore,"Viking warriors have invaded the new world. A young man that lives in a village under attack takes up his sword and fights back. One man cannot stave off the Viking hoard by himself, so he leads his people through a icy mountain path to escape. The Vikings are hot on their trail though, and another battle is inevitable.This is a very unique movie it has amazing cinematography, battle scenes, and costumes. The Vikings are very imposing and scary looking. Their armor and weapons make them look like demons. The violence and gore are gratuitous in Pathfinder. If you like action and violence, then this movie will make you a happy camper."
4,don't understand the hate,"the movie is not a history lesson. it's an action movie. i wasn't expecting it to be good, but i saw it on cable and later bought the blu-ray."
1,leftist propaganda,"Viking raiders couldn't have make it here. Big disappointment. But of course a historically accurate movie about farmers trying to make a living and getting killed wouldn't had selled as much now would it? It takas real work to make THAT interesting.After the Screenwriters strikes some years ago, Hollywood's screenwriting went to hell...and this shows."
2,vikings are not even close to thatstupid,the movie was ok but was pretty annoying. That man left behind would of been killed in five minutes if it was close to realistic.
2,cruel movie.,"A ruthless murderous movie about ainciet viking mercenarie warriors killing north american indians.The vikings considered the indians to be crazy people.A white boy survivor abandenned from past viking mercenary missions,raised by an indian tribe,seeks revenge against the next viking gang of mercenaries for the indian tribe that raised him."
3,"Arch liberal, white people are bad movie.","The following is a sarcastic review of a stupid moviewhite viking child adopted by Native Americans. 10 years pass by: The child is now a man, but not exactly considered a great warrior. Then the Vikings return to slaughter the Native Americans (for no reason, except that white vikings get a kick out of slaughtering non-white foreigners). The Indians are beaten like government mules, and than our white hero arrives. Of course, the Vikings don't attack him. After all why would they slaughter a white guy? He chops their heads off, drowns them in Ice water and they continue to trust and follow him. Why would they trust him after he kills them. god, don't ask such stupid questions. The answer is obvious: he is white.Did anyone else notice that the Native Americans spoke English, and the Vikings spoke their foreign language. It really drove home the point about who was really here first. pure genius...."
2,what should i say...,"the whole acting crew and site setting are great, but the story is quite boring, good to watch, not worth to keep it!"
4,Dark hero,"Think that the American Indians were savages?This movie shows you who the animals really were.Action,romance and a hero who is willing to sacrifice all for the people that raised him.Gore and violence abound in this movie so it's not for children.If you liked the patriot and last of the Mohicans you'll like this movie!"
2,Pathfinder,"Good premise for sure but the execution was sloppy. Too many quick cuts, poor lighting and poorly set up. All combined to make the action very difficult to follow. Rent, do not buy."
1,Terrible..,"If it wasn't for the cartoon (CGI) blood squirts coming out of every blow, this might have been halfway tolerable.There is alot of violence only there to shock you and perhaps make the movie better. But it's just there for the sake of being violent and doesn't do anything for the movie. The writing is terrible.The one redeeming factor for Pathfinder is the costumes and sets. They are kind of out of place because they're pretty good. However the lighting guys decided to ruin that too.Save yourself the time, money and feeling stupid for purchasing this DVD."
1,Beyond Awful,"Supposedly this film was a remake of the Norwegian film Pathfinder (Ofelas). I find that extremely hard to believe. The Norwegian film was quite well done and unlike the Conan-ish poop pile recently released, had a very good story. Others have gone into greater detail as to why this movie is so awful. I will just say that every time Hollywood does another worthless remake I get the feeling that they are getting more devoid of creativity and pathetically desperate. Do yourself a favor, avoid this and see the original.Pathfinder"
1,The Worst Film I Have Paid Money to See,"I read all the bad reviews on Pathfinder and even read that the release date kept getting pushed back because of horrible test screenings, but I walked in the theater with an open mind. The story sounds cool enough and I really wanted to at least have an enjoyable time. Having wasted two hours of my life and nearly ten bucks, I will hopefully save everyone reading this your time and money. I left the movie with not one good thing to say about it. Say what you will about 300, at least it entertained me. Pathfinder makes 300 look like the best epic action film to ever be made. The dialogue is beyond the worst I ever heard in a feature film and the acting is good for more than a few laughs. The action scenes are the main reason I wanted to see the film, but they weren't inventive and it was hard to tell what was going on. If you must see this movie, catch it on TV for free. You shouldn't have to wait more than a few weeks."
3,Not bad....,"This is not a bad movie but it's not a great movie either. I will say that the Vikings depicted here are the scariest, ugliest and most brutal I've ever seen in cinema. Their horses are even scary. I'd recommend it to friends of the genre."
2,"""B""","lot's of gore and gut's.very poor dialog and acting.the plot was promisingbut after 15 minutes it was a forced ""Tarzan meets Rambo meets Conan""."
1,Braindead and uninspiring with no redeaming qualities.,"I can't be more disappointed in a movie. Simple premise used in many other movies: foreigner takes on the culture of his enemy and fights with them against his former kin. Sounds easy enough right?How about instead, one pointless ""action"" sequence after another. Hey, lets see if scary, overblown Viking costumes emotes something in the audience... no?... how about a few slow-motion weapon strikes with spewing blood... no?... maybe some senseless torture of characters you don't know the names of or would even care about if you did? Again: NO!It's actually boring because of the lack of story. The plot is no more than: bad Vikings want to kill all natives. That's it, nothing more. Save your money."
3,"See the original Pathfinder, then judge for yourself","This film is a remake of a modest 1987 film about a Lapp myth of a boy who shows cunning and bravery to be a true hero to his people, and becomes their pathfinder. Teen Mikkel Gaup, with the piercing blue eyes of a husky, in his first film role, plays Aigin, the sole survivor of an attack of merciless cut-throats who uses his wits to ... well, see for yourself! The current film goes the Hollywood-epic route with a muscle-bound Rambo-style hero in Lord-of-the-Rings type battles. Not terrible, but ... why? See the original, if you can find it, then watch the remake."
5,one of my favorites,One of my all time favorite movies. I have a Norse heritage and found this movie was very entertaining and brought forth the ruthless nature of the vikings and the norse culture... I sit with my kids and we are glued to the screen during the action scenes and I can also talk with them about history and culture.I streamed this movie and it did not have to stop one time to buffer and the quality was just a good as a DVD.I stream almost all of my movies due to convenience and I like that Amazon has almost all of the newer titles without all the hassle...
4,Underrated,"Pathfinder is an odd little film considering it was basically ignored in theaters. The story follows Ghost (Karl Urban, soon to be seen as Dr. McCoy in J.J. Abrams new Star Trek film), who grew up among the Native American Indians after being left behind years earlier by his invading Viking clan. Soon enough, the blood thirsty Vikings are back, and before you know it, Ghost rallies against them. While the story progression is as predictable as can be, director Marcus Nispel (director of the 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre) provides plenty of stark set-pieces, grisly battle sequences, and beautiful shots of the gorgeous landscape. The acting from Urban, rising star Moon Bloodgood (love that name), Russell Means, and veteran Clancy Brown is as good as it is needed to be, and the overall result of Pathfinder is pretty satisfying. It certainly isn't as entertaining and prolific as 300, but for what it is, Pathfinder is an underrated action period piece."
4,Pathfinder unrated DVD,"Some have panned this title but I must admit I thought it was very entertaining. It is violent and graphic but looks terrific, in it's catagory I would consider it better than average! If native americans vrs vikings is your flavor you will probably like this!"
3,Pathfinder,"While this movie is very bloody and a bit dark, I feel that the story line is very good and well written from beginning to end."
2,Should have been called HEAD-Finder!,"Pathfinder holds the World Record for most heads chopped off in a single movie (even topping Conan the Barbarian). Frankly I lost count.The movie could have been good if the producers had worked on a couple things...-more dialogue (I didn't even know the main character's name)-more LIGHT (never has daytime seemed so dark)-lose the silly underwater scene (silly)-better use of Clancy Brown (he'll always be the Kurgan to me)-more heads being chopped off (just kidding, there's plenty of that)Pathfinder does have plenty of action. It also excels at making the Vikings uber bad-guys. I would NOT want to be a Viking.The DVD also includes some interesting featurettes and a commentary track (I think the director sees more artisitc flair in the film than I was getting). All-in-all this is a standard action film with little else to offer. Definite rental - ONLY."
1,Waste of Time,"I can't understand that I saw as many good reviews of this movie as I did. I thought this was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, the plotline was convoluted, and it seemed to drag on with no point.I wasn't fooled at all be the CG blood and gore either. This movie is a waste of anyones time and I don't recommend that anyone watch it."
3,It's Just Okay.,"The story is hard to believe. I'm not disputing that Vikings found North America circa 800 CE, I'm not disputing that encounters between the Native Americans and Vikings would have been violent, and I'm not disputing the levels of technological variance between the two peoples.What I find hard to swallow is the circumstances that lead to the ""great white hope"" coming to save the day for the native peoples. I doubt that even a Viking child would retain combat skills after being raised amongst native peoples. Especially to the degree demonstrated. Throughout the whole film I found myself saying ""Oh, come on!"". That's not to say I didn't enjoy it; the action was pretty good.The movie is a teensy bit formulaic. Underdog makes good by rescuing his adopted people. I mean as action flicks go, it's all right. It's just okay. Three stars."
4,Pretty good :),Much better than the trailer makes it out to be. I was impressed by the acting and graphics -- this is an action/adventure worth watching.
3,"Ok movie, not great","The fight scenes between the local inhabitants and invaders are worth a watch.The battle gear dress and weapons used by the invaders gives them a cool look.The movie scenes that take place on a lake and in the mountains are very entertaining.Otherwise I prefer the 1993 Stallone movie ""Cliffhanger""."
2,When Does It Start?,"While beautifully filmed and lit, this movie never begins, and never gets off the ground. Performances are wooden, and superficial. Our hero never brings his character to life. Our heroine is not desirable. Russel Means as The Pathfinder seems mummified and/or on life-support. Production is overdone, and the Nemesis is not believable, even for Fantasy, made me feel embarrassed and self-conscious, even though I watched it alone. The plot and premise and denouement were just plain silly and made no sense."
4,Great Action Adventure Film,"This is one of those films, that many are taking too seriously. Pathfinder is a fun popcorn action flick, no more no less. I can't believe how some people were expecting a history lesson from this. What you see is what you get, ninety nine minutes of pure violent action.Karl Urban is great as Ghost and the excellent Russell Means, also provides major support as the wise Pathfinder.Leave your brain at the door, sit back, relax and have fun. If you want a history lesson watch something else. If you want to be entertained for an hour and a half, watch Pathfinder."
4,Other peoples opinions ?,"I mulled over getting this DVD as the reviews for it seemed rather look warm.I ended up watching it on pay per view and wondered just what some of these folks were actually writing about. It's an action movie people not a History Channel program. It's visual presentation is superb and whenever the story lacks some iota of sense, just check out the vista's the film-makers give us. I wasn't bored, I wasn't sitting there thinking when is this going to be over even when I knew what the answer to the predicament the Pathfinder found himself in. It's an entertaining movie making no historical attempt to be correct. That is unless you only watch action movies to learn your history, may I suggest reading a book ? I ended up buying it used as I think the price is too expensive but thats my only complaint. Just grab your beverage of choice and some popcorn and expect to be entertained, thats all :)"
3,Not a bad buy,This flash is not a bad buy. It doesn't have a lot of features but it does the job. The only real problems I have with is that the head doesn't swivel and there are no markings to indicate the angle of tilt (for bounce flash). If you're just looking a separate flash to keep from using your camera flash and running down your batteries than this flash will do.
4,MUST HAVE if you want more powerful flash,"If you are tired of the Minolta pop-up dinky flash, this is the add=on to get. It's excellent and always timely."
4,dense but very readable,"I haven't had time to read all of this book, but what I have read struck me as very well written and easy to understand, despite the challenging concepts examined. The book came quickly and was in excellent condition."
1,There's a different edition that's better value,"There's a new edition of Jane Austen's complete novels that's better value than this one, you might want to take a look at it - the ISBN number is:0954840119(put this into the Amazon search box and it'll come up)."
3,"Good collection, bad author","I have nothing against this collection of Jane Austin's works. The publishing formate was good but in my opinion, Jane Austin is the most God aweful author in the world"
3,Too Big,"I love Jane Austen's books, of course, and it was unbelievably exciting for me to finally read them all. The only issue I have is that the majority of my reading occurs when I'm laying down for bed, and this book is way too big too hold up. It's huge. I think I'm going to gift it to someone and buy individual hardcover copies of each book."
4,Very quick shipping!!!,"I was very pleased with the purchase of this book. The only complaint I would have is that I did not relize that it was so big from the description. But, I'm still glad I bought it."
5,A must have for any Jane Austen fan,"I bought this for my wife, and she couldn't put it down until she finished the whole thing. A must have for any Jane Austen fan."
3,Complete book but difficult to read,Book type is very small and it is light in color making difficult to read. Nice cover.
3,too heavy,"I like Jane Austen so much. It's good to have a complete book of all her novels. The book's quality is good, but all the novels put together into one book, just imagine, too big and too heavy. it's hard to turn the page in the middle of the book and it's heavy to hold it when u r lying down to read it."
5,Kindle e-books,"I am delighted with my Kindle3, and have since ordered many ebooks through Amazon.com. The speed of downloading this book was exceedingly fast. This collection has several excellent books, and I was able to ""purchase"" it at no cost."
2,Better to stick with Pride and Prejudice,"There are not many books I finish that I regret reading but I'm sorry I read through a version of Jane Austin's complete novels. I always preferred ""Pride and Prejudice"" to ""Emma"" (although Clueless did a lot for Emma) but Austen's other heroines leave a lot to be desired and the claustrophobic atmosphere of society and poverty close in around one. I much preferred my less realistic view of her characters when I'd read ""Pride"" and abandoned ""Emma""."
2,The Complete Novels of Jane Austen (Wordsworth Library Collection),"I order the item on December 2008, still have not received on January 30, 2009, it has been over a month already. I won't be able to review the item which I contact the vendor and was told I should have received in 15 days.The Complete Novels of Jane Austen (Wordsworth Library Collection)"
1,never received book,I have never received this book and I ordered it a month ago. I am really disappointed
1,"""complete""??? Not Quite","Jane Austen's work is incomparable...however, this particular edition is certainly NOT complete. The first 3 chapters in ""Emma"" are missing. A bit disconcerting as her characters and themes are developed from the first sentence...and unless you know the story, you are quite lost as you begin reading in the pages just before Chapter 4. In answer to your question, ""what would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product???"" Sure would have like to know that it wasn't the ""complete"" novels."
4,Gorgeous book,"I bought this book for a good friend and she went bonkers when she saw it. I did too when I opened the box the day it came in the mail. I wanted to keep it for myself! The cover is beautiful, the pages are gold edged, and it is just a wonderful book!"
3,too heavy,"While the book itself is great, it is really heavy to hold up and its only great for table reading, i would estimate the book weighing between 5-7lbs so if your a tub reader or an in bed reader i wouldn't recommend this book for you."
5,Jane Austen: The Complete Novels,"The book, even though it was not ""new"" was in excellent condition, and very appropriate for giving as a gift. It's a great book to have if you are a Jane Austen fan, as all her novels are in one book, so the collection is complete. It was packed well, and it was received within days of the order. Easy Christmas shopping, thank you!"
4,The Complete Novels (Penguin Classics Duluxe Edition) of Jane Austen,"This book is wonderful if you want to experience all of Jane Austen's works in one book. It can be a bit heavy sometimes when trying to read in bed. The book has a beautiful and classy cover that I enjoy, as well. So far, ""Sense and Sensibility"" is the only one I've read, and it was wonderful. Can be a bit slow if you're not used to the languege... I suggest a dictionary."
2,Do not buy from this company!!!!!!!!,It took forever to get this book.Contacting them was impossible.The book itself is as big as a dictionary but a great book.
1,Hard to read paperback,"After watching the Jane Austin Book Club, my wife and I decided to read the complete Jane Austin books to better understand the first movie. I purchased a paperback edition from Amazon.com, which arrived in a few days. The book, published by Penguin Paperbacks, has an uneven cut in the binding. The pages stick out like it had come apart and been re-glued. The paper, since it is a paperback, is an off white that with the small print is too hard for my aging eyes to read, although younger readers may not have a problem. In order to read the books, I went online and found the entire series for free since it is in the public domain. I am reading the book on my laptop instead where I can increase the font size for easier reading.The stories, of course, are worthwhile reading. More is understood than just what the videos on PBS and BBC shows, as is always the case when comparing books to film. But, for $[...], it is nice to have a hard copy of the books."
4,The Complete Novels of Jane Austen,"I had seen several of her books made into movies but never read her novels (what a travesty!). Although I loved the movies and BBC mini series, it was just not the same as reading the original works. I'm loving the books, but do find the bulk a little much sometimes. Not really something you take to the doctor's office to read while you're waiting (smile). I definitely love it's look and of course the content, but think I'll also order them individually for re-reading. Great price and wonderful quality."
5,A beautifully presented volume,"Jane Austen is Jane Austen--no surprises here :)What I do wish to say, is this: this is a beautifully bound and presented book.It's a good quality paperback (nice thick cover), with beautiful rough-cut/uneven edges to the pages, a very pretty cover, and it looks lovely on the shelf and in the hand. It opens nicely (without the stiffness you sometimes find in very large books).Although not overly bulky for such a large collection, it achieves this by having long pages with a lot of text. This is my only reservation (albeit slight): if you have difficulty with very full/long pages, perhaps this edition is not for you. There is still enough space to leave it readable, but it's a consideration."
5,"""No house should be without one""","The works of Jane Austin have been written about by far better writers than myself...all I know is this is ""writing"" the way writing is supposed to be in a civilized society...a ""must have in any literate household""!Beautifully presented in a tome that can be passed on to the next generation.Exquisite!"
5,What the kindle was meant for,"I had a copy of the Complete Illustrated Novels of Jane Austen before I bought the Kindle. It was a pain to have to drag the 1200+ page book around with me. The book itself is easy to use, and it's great to have all the novels together. This was the first book I bought on the Kindle and I'm really happy with it. Thank you, Kindle, for lightening my purse considerably!"
1,Poor Editing,I love Jane Austen. But this edition is full of spelling and text errors. Words that run together. Context that was not checked. These are annoying. The editor clearly didn't do his or her job. I was very disappointed.

1,Incomplete Edition from Bloomsbury as pictured above,"This book is certainly not as advertised. The dust jacket AND cover clearly state that it contains the complete novels of Jane Austen. It enumerates all seven in both locations. It never gives any indication whatsoever that this might be the first volume of two. Indeed the first printed page declares that it is in one volume.Despite all this, the table of contents only lists the first four books from the cover. That is all that is contained within. No 'Persuasion.' No 'Lady Susan.' And most important to me, no 'Northanger Abbey' -- the book I was planning to read immediately. Amazing.Please be aware that the Bloomsbury Books edition (Under license from Penguin dated 1994) with the cover as shown on this page (with the customer image from Dilli) has these substantial defects. [ISBN 1-854-71406-6] [1002 pages]"
5,A Wonderful Addition and Edition!,I have loved these books since junior high school and now with this beautiful edition I can have it all! The pages are not flimsy and with the place-marker ribbon I can easily find where I am in the book. The typeface is easy to read as well. You can't go wrong with such a great writer.
1,Missing what it is supposed to contain,"I received this book today very excited because I love Jane Austen and was very interested in reading her letters and unfinished works.I am sad to say that this book does NOT contain the following:Minor and unfinished works: Sanditon, The Watsons, and Lady Susan.Juvenilia: Frederic & Elfrida, Love and Freindship, Lesley Castle, The History of England, A Collection of Letters, Scraps --This text refers to the Kindle Edition edition. nfinished works. I have already read all but one of her completed works. I am sad to say it does not containIt does state that the book contains this, in the description. Don't be fooled."
2,Many Typos in the Kindle Edition,"I love Jane Austen, but am very disappointed in this Kindle edition's quality. I am finding several typos in every chapter of Pride and Prejudice. I haven't started the other books yet.Translating ""chuse"" into ""choose"", ""shew"" into ""show"", ""ancle"" into ""ankle"", and ""stile"" into ""style"" wasn't hard. Turning ""riot"" into ""not"" took me longer. It is as if the text was scanned into an electronic format, but never copy edited. I bought this more expensive version hoping to get the best edition out there. I think I should have tried one of the $1.99 versions instead."
4,"Kindle on iPhone/iPad great, except for illustrations","The illustrations in the Kindle version are so low in resolution that they're not really worth looking at. You can't enlarge them at all. They don't even look okay at the standard size on my iPhone.However, I do love WhisperSync. Being able to pick my iPhone up and start up where I left off the evening before on my iPad is genius!"
1,Classic,"Thought I would enjoy reading these stories. Unfortunately, they are not to my liking. I don't care for Ms. Austen's writing style."
5,Classic,"I just adore all of Jane Austen's books and characters. It is a nice way of ""seeing"" into the past worlds of these women. Very cool. :)"
3,Ugh! Very intimidating,"This is the complete works...but no one says how huge this book is. I was looking for something that would be easy to take with me, not a coffee table book. This is pretty intense its about a foot long and about 6 or 8 inches wide. Basically you start reading on the left and at some pt on the right page maybe a new chapter. I was looking for something with the complete works but I could take to and from work. This maybe just something to look at...I can't imagine trying to hold this and read. Kinda reminds me of Alice in Wonderland lol Other then that it does look pretty and is in great shape."
3,Musty odor comes with book!,"I have one problem with this book. It smells like it has been in storage for many years. I don't know how to get rid of the odor. I am hoping that by leaving it out of the bookshelf and open that the odor will disappear in time. If anyone has a suggestion, I would sure like it.The book itself is very nice. I thought if I sent it back, there would be no guarantee that a replacement would not smell the same. I noted that the book was printed in CHINA!"
1,Weak,"Hooked up a kenwood DAC 9104d to them, wired it at 4 ohms and powered the amp down to try and keep them under 175. Figured they would handle what I consider minimal bass output for a decent sub. I was wrong. They lasted for exactly 3 minutes. They both went out quick, I thought my amp went into protection so I stopped at a gas station, amp was on and functioning. I come home and hook up an old 12, it thumps. Hook them back up, one is producing zero sound and the other one is producing an extremely low faint of sound. It's blown. Figured when one failed the power to the other probably shot up killing it completely in a fraction of a second. These subs suck. I was running at lowest power possible unless I went to 8 ohms which I considered. Last time I pay 30 dollars for a sub."
4,Good,I'm mainly using it for strength gain and not rehabilitation...though I work in computers so this could help prevent carpal tunnel by strengthening my forearms. I got the green and I am going to purchase the next size up. Its good to start on the green to get the rhythm down on how to do the Tyler Twist exercises and ensure I am perfect in executing them. When I get the next size up I will not have to focus on technique as much as getting a workout now.My only issue is it does wear my hands down a bit so I have weight lifting gloves to protect my hands from getting blisters/severe callus.
5,"WARNING, this workout is addictive and the team's enthusiasm is highly contagious!","If you want a magical transformation, this is not the workout for you. Actually, I think such a workout doesn't exist. This DVD is an intense and demanding 55 minutes of exercise that is very challenging, but it is worth it. Combine it with the ab boot camp and you will be hooked if you take the time to build your strength. Don't be discouraged if you have to stop to get some water or take a break, just keep moving and keep trying. You will be able to do it within 2 weeks and you will feel the empowerment that hard work and discipline offer you (that wasn't easy for me). Try ""basic training boot camp"" for three weeks before you attempt this advanced one and it will help build your strength and confidence.A side not: if you are mad, frustrated or disappointed, this workout will help you release some of the anger and transform it into positive energy!"
4,good workout but poorly produced,"This is workout mixes cardio-style kickboxing and resistance band training. This is a good workout if you want an ""all-in-one"" video workout. It will touch all the major muscle groups and will give you some good cardio. The video requires resistance bands (two) that should be long enough to put one foot in the bottom and then allow you to do rowing exercises with your hands above your head. You can substitute light weights but you will want to slow the pace of the exercises down. This video does not really target the abs very well so you may want to throw in some additional ab work.The production, however, does feel sloppy. Some of the folks in the back will be out of step and it doesn't feel like there was a good editor involved. If this does not bother you then this is probably a good workout to put in the rotation.This workout is aimed at an intermediate level exerciser."
2,Disappointed!,"I was an avid Taebo fan when it first came out. With Taebo Basic, I lost over 25 pounds. I thought this would get back to the heart of kickboxing, but I was very disappointed. I knew bands were needed, but I thought it would still be a great workout without them. There was only one person on the DVD that didn't use bands, and there is no point in doing this DVD without bands. I did the whole 55 minute workout and wasn't even out of breath. Even with the bands, this workout is not kickboxing... not what Taebo should be! I sincerely wish I had saved my money instead of buying this DVD!"
1,ORTHOPEDIC NIGHTMARE!,"First let me say that, if you can stand listening to Billy Blanks (who gets UNBELIEVABLY annoying), you will get a good workout. However, it will come at the cost to irreparably damaging your shoulders and knees. His shoulder exercises require lifting bands above the shoulders --something every orthopedist says you should NEVER DO; his leg exercises require constant squatting --another exercise that, if done too often and with repetition, will cause great damage to your knees. After a year doing these tapes, I required cortisone shots to remedy the bursitis to my shoulders and arthroscopic surgery on my knee.USE THESE TAPES AT YOUR OWN RISK. My advice: good old fashion swimming, running, hiking and SAFE weightlifting will do the trick and cause minimal damage. These tapes will help you lose weight but cause a great deal of damage to your body in the process. Your choice."
4,So so sore from doing Billy's Bootcamp,"Billy's Ultimate Bootcamp workout definitely works. My only complaint is that you do need to purchase the resistance bands, but they have an option for completing the entire workout without them. I still have not purchased them and every time I do the workout I am sore for at least 3 days, so I know it's doing something! Have fun!"
4,Its a hard workout,I feel like this dvd is more stength then cardio. Its a good workout and i usuually get really tired in teh middle to the point i can't finish. Some of the exercises are little to repetitive for me. If you want a good cardio workout go with taebo live advanced workouts there sooo good.
4,Great workout,"I really love Billy Blanks and Tae bo, is an excellent work out. Love this video, is a little bit harder than ""Basic Boot camp"", with some different movements. Totally recommended it, but if you have not tried Basic Boot camp or any other Tae bo Video.. you should think about it twice. The video is about 50 minutes, and you work arms, legs and abs."
4,Good and Tough!!,"Disc came in great shape! Ordered used copy but got a brand new copy instead. Billy Blanks does it again, this one focuses more on arms also uses resistance bands but just as good w/o the bands. I like this one but i enjoy the punch combos over the push ups hammer curls etc. Also more squating than he normally does. If he had more of that i'd be totally satisfied. Over all it's still great, just depends on your preference."
3,it was good but...,"It was cool, but I don't think it was worth 10 bucks. I feel kinda ripped off that there was only the video and the remix. If you'e on a limited budget like me, I do not recommend it."
2,An Amazing Video..,"...yet Highly overpriced. Parabola is probably TOOL's best music video in my opinion , and no doubt it probably took weeks to film and edit the video , but there is no way that one music video is worth 10 dollars. Not to mention that the special features..if you can call them that..are extremely lacking. The commentary is horribly boring..and the remix is completely awful. It would have served them better to release a DVD with all of their music videos on one disc...or even if they included a live video of Parabola on the DVD in addition to the music video. Overall , an amazing video..but not worth the money."
5,Take It For What It Is,"This DVD was not meant to introduce new music, it was not meant to show a new video but what it was meant for was to show an OLD video with commentary and a remix of an OLD song so why is everyone getting so bent out of shape. No one is forcing you to buy it but if you do decide to buy it and know what it is going into the purchase you will be happy with it."
4,Left Wanting More,I was really expecting more from TOOL. What was on it was good but I was left wanting so much more.
5,Experience and transcend,"Full opening creates a two stage feel in the visual experience of the video of Parabola. Pleasantly disturbing characters combine with surreal and minimal story to enhance the music. The transceding finale obviously uses the artwork and animation of Alex Grey.The goofy commentary/double commentary track is funny and reminds me that Tool ain't bout takin yrself too seriously, I mean, it's something a total tool would do anyway. Those silly guys...There isn't much more other than a meditative audio remix of Parabola, cool with the lights out, Maynard sounds enlightened.Buy this and support deserving musicians and ambitious visual artists. Think for yourself fool."
5,An appetizer to hold us over till the new album,If you are a Tool fan like me then you have probably been anxiously awaiting their new album which is supposed to be out sometime in 2006. In the meantime we'll have to survive on this bare DVD.
2,save the cash,"Let's make this short. First, if you are a fair weather fan, don't waist the money. This is only one track and not worth it. This is a good song off an album that is loosing it's zip. The video is a standard tool video, claymation and bizarre images. However, other than the first track, the rest is just a waste of time and money. The audio comentary is not funny, and makes tool look like fools (but with a some of my money, and me feeling used.) The bonus remix is nothing but an extension 8 minutes of ambient noise before the same song. If you want real trance like meditation like music, listen to Neurosis, they have been doing this for 15 years and are a lot better at it. Tool better have a heck of a next album to dig themselves out of this embarassment. The only reason I do not give this a 1 is that this video is nice to have near salival in my collection."
1,"$10.00 ""Tool "" coaster?","Allthough the paper sleeve did start a fire... the DVD Disc does serve well as a ""coaster"" on my coffie table. So far."
3,Parabola,The dvd was a let down. THere is only one music video and a wacky duel commentary that I found a little anoying. I'd say it's good for collectors but not for someone who wants a lot for their money.
4,What you've been waiting for since Lateralus,"The next chapter in the book according to Tool. I can't wait until I have this in possession. *pre-booking now*Also, see the Schism DVD."
5,An Amazing Kids Book,"This is a complete and utter thrill to read, both for me and my 7 year old son. We sit for hours looking over the book, discussing history from a more adult viewpoint. He has learned more from this book than he has from any other single educational document thus far.I will get this book for everyone I know, and recommend it to everyone I don't know...watch out...their might be a run on this book, so buy it now.We got it as a gift from a English friend who attended Oxford (full ride scholorship - a brillant guy). He loved it!!!"
5,History and Linguistics,"I love this book and have worn out two copies. Students, with little regard to ability or reading level, can view the changes that take place in England in one spot over time. I use it to introduce layers that exist in the English language, where all those different words, affixes and spelling rules came from."
5,endlessly fascinating,"all the kids AND adults in our house are endlessly fascinated by this book. we always find something on every page that we hadn't noticed before. aside from the hundreds of historical details is the gorgeous artwork, placing the street/town in various times of day and seasons of the year. you can almost smell the fall air, the snow in winter. i've seen most of the ""a ____ through time"" books, and this is the best, in my opinion. the scale is not too big, and not too small. this a book that will be pored over for many years."
5,Great for studying history,"We homeschool, and both my 7 and 5 year old have been studying history over the last two years, from early history, into Greek then Roman times, and now in the Middle Ages. This book has been a wonderful addition to our studies. Wonderful illustrations. Amazing to watch civilizations rise and fall."
2,Making things sophisticated/complicated?,"Why make things so complicated? Though I'm new in Delphi transitioning from Visual Basic, I quickly found a couple of solutions both verbose and unnecessary complicated. Check out e.g. how M.C. suggests how to treat the Enter key as Tab key and how to read the Shift state; both being solved much simpler by only a couple of code lines if sought elsewhere (Procedure TForm1.FormKeyPress ... If Key = #13 Begin Then SelectNext(ActiveControl as tWinControl,True,True); Key:=#0; end; ... or Procedure TForm1.FormKeyDown ..... If ssAlt in Shift Then ..., courtesy of UNDU letter #14 June 96 and 'Delphi 3 User Interface Design' respectively). However, I'm sure some hardcore programmers will love the sophisticated solution handlings from this book, but this book surely wasn't ment for entry level users looking for easy solutions. Niels Knabe"
4,Could have been better...,"I guess my expectations were very high after Mastering Delphi 3. Obviously the et al did a whole lot more writing then Marco in this one. The examples were solid though, and I really enjoyed the CGI chapter. Was dissapointed on the lack of coverage for many of the (advanced) controls missed in Mastering Delphi (Decision Cubes, TClientDataSets,TRemoteServer,etc). Next time Marcus, write it by yourself."
4,Excellent,"Alan Silva may be free-jazz's best kept secret. Few fans know about him, but virtually everyone in the post-Coltrane jazz avant-gaurd knows Alan--Lester Bowie, Joe Bowie, Alan Shorter, his friends from his music school, Sun Ra's Arkestra, and about five dozen others.How do I know they know Alan?: well, they have all worked in his Celestial Communications Orchestra, which is a big name for a big group that Silva has led since the early 1970s.This band, shamefully under recorded, preforms hour long peices, mixing waves of avant noise with spacey passages. Some of this borders on space rock without the electronics.Silva's work is rare and expensive, which is a shame, because he is one of the true belivers, taking one of the biggest and best free jazz bands around the world for decades.To hear his outstanding work, this double set is a fine example. This dense music requires effort, but this will be rewarded to the true free jazz devotee."
4,Interesting Information on the Final Days of Hitler,"This book uncovers a wealth of Soviet information concerning the last hours of Adolf Hitler and what happened to his body. Not only is good, convincing data provided but rare photos of Hitler's body but also even one of Blondi (Hitler's dog whom was a guinea pig in a cynide effectiveness experiment). The book's only drawback was the author's over-the-top Soviet disposition and inclinations. However, this book is well worth the time of those who are history buffs or those who just want to know exactly what happened in Hitler's bunker."
2,Wrong Item,"I am collecting all NFL replica mini helmets, what i got from this purchase was micro mini helmets. These are smaller version of the ones i have been buying. The description was not correct the word micro was not in the listing. Returned both helmets hope there is no issue with the return."
3,20 minutes removing sticker residue,This compass seems like it will work fine but the price does not seem warranted. I am also irritated that it was shipped to me with a huge sticker covering the sighting mirror. This is proving to be very difficult to remove and to me it cheapens the product.
1,Made in China,"I thought I was buying a made in Sweden, high quality compass. This is a made in China junker. I spent hours researching and tried to find the best compass. When I found this, I was expecting it to be the Brunton made in Sweden. But alas, there was no indication on the Beach Audio site, where this compass was made. So I feel betrayed and duped.So, beware. This is not the quality Sweden made instrument you may have been misled to believe."
2,Looks nice but broke early,"This looked like a great value, and was the type recommended for an upcoming search and rescue training class. Used a few times, then 3 months after purchase it quit knowing where north was. Sort of important for a compass.I was travelling, and was unable to return until early November. Brunton rep said no problem, we will take care of it.It is now Jan., and they are still making excuses as to why they have not sent me a replacement.There are other choices out there. I am very disappointed."
4,excellent compass,"The Brunton type 15 is an excellent compass. What I enjoy the most is having the protractors (both 1:50,000 and 1:24,000) cut right into its baseplate. This eliminates the need to carry a separate plastic protractor like we did in the Army. The entire compass has easy to read numbers, everything is sharply etched, including the glow-in-the-dark points, of which there are eight. The needle swings freely with no stoppages or hiccups. The azimuth ring moves smoothly too, but is built into the frame tightly enough so that it won't slip accidentally. The best feature by far is the declination adjustment. I think this time saver would have been considered cheating in the Army. The type 15 for Brunton is still made in Sweden where it originated. Most of their competition, even those that once produced military quality compasses like Silva, now have their instruments churned out of southeast Asian factories, despite selling them for comparable prices."
5,It Was Fun Entertainment,"What has not been said about this DVD I will not rehash. Nothing about indie films will be perfect, but I will say I purchased this DVD with an open mind and enjoyed watching the guys do their thing with heart and soul. The lead actor is a local boy done good...also seen him around town and you simply can't ask for a nicer guy! With his many talents a continued success with all his endeavors."
3,Worth watching once or twice,"It is obviously a cheaply made movie, But the actors are hot. The Main guy is a little too whinny for me, and the love interest is a little too cocky. I must say that there are alot of funny moments that make you out and out laugh, but the ending, in my opinion is quite a let down.I don't want to ruin it, but let me say, no one should have to settle."
2,"Poor, but has its moments","I have seen this one soon after I saw ""Singing forest"" and I must admit that it is worth the second star. I didn't find it difficult to watch it from the beginning to the very last minute.The movie is very very amateurish, but as I mentioned above, has its moments.The whole idea could be even more entertaining if only the filmmakers had some more cash to shoot it properly.The acting is not good, but at least people, who star in it, don't try too much to prove that they are real actors:) They read their lines and that's it.There is a lot of talk in this movie about gays, dated by the main character, who appeared to be jerks, morons etc.Unfortunately, it is our hero who is the biggest jerk, giving up his dreams and beliefs to be with notorious cheater. So, the ending is quite disappointing."
2,It's alright,"I typically watch a lot of movies having see most of the gay ones, I picked this one although it had some negative reviews. If you have time to spare it will entertain you, it's just not memorable."
3,Not as bad as I expected.,"From reading the reviews, I expected the worst, but was pleasantly surprised. While this isn't a top notch gay romantic comedy like ""All Over the Guy"", it is entertaining. I thought the production value was fairly good for a low budget film. I enjoyed the second half more than the first half, but I have to agree with others on the ending. The ending was quite unsatisfying, in that it sends the wrong message that it's okay just to settle for someone in a situation that you really don't want."
1,Useless!,"Don't buy this nail clipper; it's a piece of junk. I hoped that spending 10 times the cost of the typical drug store clipper, I would get a decent product, but I was wrong. The cutting edge is just not sharp, which makes the whole thing useless. I am now in the market for a new clipper."
3,Book,Didn't really read. Wasn't what I was looking for. Have tried to delete from kindle but unable to. Was free so can't. Complain.
5,A very good read; good for analysis.,"I initially bought the book simply out of interest of Nietzsche himself and found that the book can be used as a tool to help analyze Christianity and its influences much more deeply than it has been within the book. The one thing that is disappointing is that Nietzsche writes with a tone that seems to enforce the typical ""angry atheist"" stereotype that many Christians love to cling to (of course, I suppose one could argue that every time anybody voices their opinions on religion in a less than flattering manner, Christians will slap that stereotype on them)."
3,"Powerful book, but still....","I'm from Denmark, and I have read the danish version. I can say the impact this book have had, can only be respected. It has inspired many great people: M.Manson, LaVey etc. and I also like the book, and Nietzsche make some good arguments, but still its very hard to read for most people(even I had a bit of a hard time some places). If you're not so good at reading/not good at english try another book."
3,"It's a good read, but...",it gets a bit repeatative at times. definatly not for those who are closed minded and/or christian.
5,Psychology of Christianity,"A vigorous and courageous look at Christianity as it is practiced and the psychology of the people who practice it. This book can not be understood properly unless Nietzshe's previous philosophical works have been read, particularly ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" and the ""Geneology of Morals."" It should be the last of Nietzsche's works to be read rather than the first, as is often the csae."
4,A Good Start,"Considering that Nietzsche wrote ""The Anti-Christ"" in the late 1800's, I have to give Nietzsche, the seemingly archtype-philosopher, kudos. He does a plausible job at dissecting the doctrines of Chritianity as being anti-Nature. True, and unfortunately, God is not entirely taken out of the picture; but hey, it was a legitimate start for Nietzsche's time period. A better book, though, than ""The Anti-Christ,"" and a book that somes-up the God-Judeo-Christian-Semitic connection is the book ""Nature's Eternal Religion,"" by Ben Klassen. To those interested in studying philosophy and God, you can't go wrong with Klassen's book because it seems to be a natural continuation of ""The Anti-Christ."""
5,The stongest conclusion Nietzche could have made.,"It's hard too add something to what's already stated in all reviews.For those who have some doubts about religion, Nietzche may provide the best guidance. I personally do not recommend to read this before you read some other works of the author, such as 'Genealogy of Morals', Thus Spoke Zarathustra', and 'Beyond Good and Evil' - even one of those alone will definitely help. The Anti-Christ, is short because it's only a conclusion and a final verdict to Christianity, rather than development of the argument."
3,For disciples only,"I'd recommend this book only for those who feel that Nietzsche was the inspired prophet of the death of Christianity. If you feel that way you'll love this book, since it presents his anti-christian ideas in their most vehement form. If your views on Christianity and related issues are more nuanced (or wishy-washy), you'd be better off reading Beyond Good and Evil and The Geneaology of Morals, where the same ideas are discussed more calmly and lucidly."
1,raving....,"Judging from the mania and hatred of his tone, Nietzsche was suffering when he wrote this from whatever (syphillis?) would soon destroy his mind. But of course it's impossible to say how much an influence that had no what he wrote here about Christianity.The book is useful mainly as a study in how one can fuss and fume at Christianity all one wants, but in the very forms of our debate we tend to invite in Christian assumptions that have informed our culture for two millennia. Nietzsche, who was a pastor's son, might have given his own assumptions a look or two before writing this, keeping what he liked and discarding what didn't nourish him. Needless to say, stereotyping, blaming, and attacking an entire belief system does no one good, least of all the attacker.""When one hunts monsters, one must be careful not to become a monster oneself--for when you look deeply into an abyss, the abyss looks deeply into you."" -- Nietzsche"
3,The Anti-Christ,"Nietzsche really rips into Christianity in this one. There are other critiques of Christianity that I like better (Natures Eternal Religion by Ben Klassen and The Age of Reason by Thomas Paine are a couple off the top of my head) but for someone with the worldview that Nietzsche had this is pretty good. The main righteous point he makes is that Christianity is completely anti-nature, human and otherwise."
3,Non intuitive settings,The unit has good sound and works good but I dread even thinking about trying to set the settings on this thing. I have done it but they are very unintuitive. Also the remote has to be aimed so directly that I had to make the unit crooked on my shelf so that it points staight at where I sit. I can't even explain what I mean except everthing seems to be done out of sequence. It is so bad that I am thinking of selling it just to get someything with easier and more intuitive set ups.
3,"EPIC, but.....","i was so exited to read this book, and it was awesome and action-packed, but is had dirty words in it like on every page, so i did not finish the book. Make a clean version, willya?"
2,Never met a simile I didn't like,"First, this was a non-stop action thriller, and there are some interesting descriptions of weapons and weapons systems that were interesting. The book is so off the wall that it became zany and not even close to anything approaching reality. Maybe that wasn't the objective. It's roughly 150 pages too long. To use Reilly's favorite and well over-used technique. It's like the Bible written by a 10 year old."
3,"Action-Packed, but not very believable","SEVERAL times while reading this book, I found myself laughing out loud at the unbelievable scenes. This book has some really cool action sequences, but man are they HARD to even begin to believe.Some of the stuff is things you'd only think to find in a video game.I'm not sorry I read it, but I think it'll be a long while before I pick up another Matthew Reilly book."
2,Overly galore persecutions,"Albeit you'll learn many things about Area 7 & 8. Although you'll learn about chemical and nuke weapons, this book's really boring. Each chapter begins with a persecution. So, how many persecutions could you read in a book? How many times the book's hero can save himself or being save by other person? At half book when you're still reading persecutions, you'll know that Schofield and Gant will survive. About the inexistent love story that of course is pathetic I won't write more. So if you like my kind of books (check my listmania! list) don't read this one."
1,Unbelievably Stupid,"Let me start by saying that this isn't the worst-written book I've ever read. But it has to be the stupidest and least-believable one. As I continued to plow through this unrelenting waste of time, I kept asking ""Why?"" Why did the bad guy implant a radio transmitter in the heart of someone on the off-chance that he would become President? Why did he set up an elaborate game of hunter/hunted in the super-secret installation? Why did all the commandos go along with all this? Why did he plant ""Plasma"" bombs (apparently atomic bombs were't cool enough) in 14 American cities...did he think the survivors would thank him for emasculating the U.S.? Trust me, you have to do more than suspend your disbelief to read this book...you will have to have it surgically removed. Then, I suppose, you can take a crack at the author's other books. Save yourself...I can't get back the several hours I wasted on this book, but it's not too late for you. Run, do not walk, away from it."
1,Read something else!,"If you like Michael Crihton and W.E.B. Griffin, do not read this book! It's a waste of science fiction and Military fiction. I enjoy both of the above authors, however Matthew Riley is a reltively poor writer. It's far-fetched and the action ludicrous. Mabey a good try for someone who has never been in the military or worked in a real secure installation."
3,One of Reilly's Lesser Efforts,"Don't get me wrong. ""Area 7"" is still a thrilling read, but this time around everything feels just a little bit more forced. The closed setting, the plot twists, and of course the action. Granted, it was Reilly's first sequel, so he was trying to figure out the ropes, and there was a bit of a misstep.The idea of this enclosed real-life deathmatch appears interesting at first, and some of the twists promise good things, but really...it just isn't as exciting as previous novels. It picked up pace quite explosive in the final fifty or so pages, and it was a quick read throughout, but a dissappointing novel.Not really a good one for the new Reilly fan, but if you are already familiar with his work, you should get this one. It's worth reading, it just doesn't reach the dizzying heights of his other stuff."
1,We cut down trees for this junk?,"If you can completely suspend logic and put your brain into ""park"", then this is the novel for you. Poorly written in comic book style, there is no lack of action...except none of it is believable. The characters are shallow, the plot is so silly as to almost be amusing, and the exploits of the characters makes the good guys able to dodge bullets and other assorted nasties while the bad guys clumsily get themselves eliminated. If you can understand the rationale for the plot you get to go to the ""head of the class"". This is a perfect book to read in front of a fireplace on a cold winter evening...in fact it is a perfect book to use to light the fireplace, hopefully before you waste too much time reading it."
2,"Well, at least the action doesn't stop","For starters, I really like Matthew Reilly. I've read Contest, Ice Station, and Temple. Now if you thought Temple was over the top, wait til you get a hold of Area 7.My wife is a huge fan of Reilly, but about 50 pages into the book (I don't believe that this is a spoiler, but tread lightly) when the main antagonist reveals his plans, I remember saying to my wife how ludicrous the plot was. And it is ludicrous. And some of the action sequences are so ludicrous that you will literally roll your eyes when they happen. Still, Reilly is a decent writer and a good storyteller - you just have go beyond a basic suspension of belief for this one."
5,Sandy who loves to read,"Typical of all the Matthew Reilly books I have read, you don't get a moments peace. The action starts practically at the first page. I don't believe so much happens within such a short amount of time. Loved it."
5,never put it down,"This book like the other ones I have read by this author just grabs you and sucks you in. I also like the little diagrams that they make for you to better picture the situation these people are in. When I read I always try to see where the people are and this book is very good for that, plus the non stop action kept me going and going."
3,Pure time-pass!,"This book SHOULD be read only if you are waiting in the airport to catch a long-delayed flight, or while pursuing some other (similar) pursuit. This book is undoubtedly rather difficult to part-with while in the middle of reading, but it stretches the border of incredulity to such an extreme point that the whole thing becomes pointless at the end. With multiple conspiring groups trying to prove something/steal something/kill something (i.e. someone, who is, incidentally, the President of the U.S.A) etc. etc. and Reilly's hero Scarecrow and his team trying to save the world (i.e. the President), and the whole thing taking place at a speed faster than anything conceivable, the book is bound to receive some expletives after the end of reading, question is: would they be positive, or negative?"
3,Hmmmmmm,"This is an O.K. read. This was a bit over the top: someone should disable the author's exclamation point key because he uses it far too often. Otherwise, if you like a bit of make-believe ala James Bond, this is good."
2,Too Much Explosives,"Somewhat of a disappointment. This story wasn't half as good as Reilly's first book, Ice Station. However, I noticed a lot of similarities between Area 7 and Ice Station which likely therefore didn't make for much excitement for me. Like Ice Station, the setting takes place in a secret underground multi-story facility. There is a bunch of gun battles and fighting between the good guys and the mercenaries. And, everyone is out to obtain or protect a secret prized possession hidden within the depths of the facility. Throw the President of the United States into the mix and you have another whirlwind action sequence thriller that never seems to end, but seemingly gets lost in a bunch of grenades, bullets, and explosives."
3,Improbable and fast paced.,"Non-stop action with never a pause for food, drinking water or rest. I was exhausted just reading it. The rest of the world seems to stand still while the president is held hostage. No mobilization of the national guard or any of the services delegated to protect the president. It is all left up to a small group of invincibles to save the day. I was particularly intrigued with the Maghook and its use in saving Schofield. He attached it to a helicopter and pulled himself up and inside the aircraft. Now, if memory serves, magnets are attracted to iron and steel, not aluminum, particularly the skin of an aluminum aircraft. After the Maghook incident on the helicopter I sort of lost some of my interest in continuing on although I did eventually finish the book."
2,We don't need no characterization,"A video game on paper. Levels and all. Read one, read 'em all.Won't have to read it again."
2,No more... <I>stop</I>!,"Like Chinese water <I>torture</I>, as the book wore <I>on</I> my nerves became increasingly frayed by the constant use of <I>italics</I>, often in the most inappropriate <I>places</I>..."
1,"So bad and over the top, it was actually great comedy!","Yes, this silly over the top story was really Prey by Michael cricton meets da vinci code by Dan Brown. (remember the da vinci code was a work of fiction ok?! the hero ran around and across continents without sleeping for 72 hrs or having to go to the loo!)Area 7 is just as far fetched and comical - main hero surives death about 9 times, when all the others that go through the same process get eaten or die ... blah blah .....So if you want a big laugh or a bizarre fantasty tale, this is for you, but if you're looking for a grouse tale of mystery fiction, you'll be very disappointed."
1,This book is [not good],"My review title says it all. If Reilly set out to write a really bad book, which would eventually be made into a really bad movie, he succeeded admirably with ""Area 7"". I recently read the book at an island holiday resort, and the only reason I didn't throw it in the rubbish (as I eventually did when I returned to the mainland) was that I had nothing else to read on the beach. Reilly develops his characters such that you frankly don't care who lives or dies. His plots are inane, and considering the research he claims to have done, they contain numerous technical impossibilities. Frankly, the book reads like it was written by a 12 year old. Someone should also disable the italics function on Reilly's word processor. Not only are italics grossly overused, they often just don't make sense. Save your time, don't buy this book, and certainly don't read it."
1,This is a best seller???????,"I needed and interesing book for a long flight. I Chose ""Area 7"" as it sounded like my kind of novel.I could not finish it. It is so far fetched and lacking in plot that I will not read Mr Reilly's efforts again. Don't waste your money either."
1,The Worst Thing I've Ever Read. Period.,"I'm serious about that. ... The comic strip Beetle Bailey is more militarily accurate (and frankly, more mature too).Not only does it seem to have been written by a team of apes with crayons, it's also unnecessarily vulgar. I don't have any problem with gritty language in a book aimed at mature readers; but this book's plot is aimed at pre-teen level, and much of the language used is pretty foul.If you're interested in military thrillers, try elsewhere. Tom Clancy, for instance. As for this lump of trash I can only recommend it as good kindling."
1,Kitchen Sink drek,"In the publishing business, this is what is known as a ""Kitchen Sink Novel"", i.e., the author threw everything at the page. I found it tedious and I was unable to suspend my sense of absurdity, much less suspend my disbelief. Did you know there is a magnet that will stick to the aluminum hull of a helicopter?? I didn't (and still don't)! It boggles my mind how much drek is in this story. This book should be a teaching aid for what NOT to do when plotting a novel."
1,Reads like a Steven Seagal movie,"Never before have I read a book that italicizes so much for such a terrible reason. Every few pages some wholly unbelievable action takes place *just as* something else equally unlikely *almost* kills, maims, or somehow incapacitates our hero. Reilly sees fit to italicize how close they are to danger, as indicated by my asterisks above, not just once, not just twice, but repeatedly and far beyond any level of acceptability.Reilly gives the reader a lackluster plot incorporating all the worst elements of a Seagal or van Damme ego-booster. Far from a page-turner, I found no trouble setting Reilly's work down to listen to the flight attendant ""go over the safety features of this Airbus A320."" It was far more interesting than the book -- a shame it only lasted a couple of minutes."
2,Like a comic book without the pictures,"This is the third book I've read by this author and probably the best of the bunch, which isn't really saying much. The general plot of the story is very intriguing, but he never develops it. There were so many different ways he could have gone, but he decides on creating 3 or 4 subplots and that's it. The story ends up being somewhat confusing (who's the bad guy in THIS chapter?). If you're just in it for the action and have time to kill, this book serves its purpose. But if you're looking for something half way plausible, with more than just a dash of character development, you might want to look elsewhere (like anything by Vince Flynn)."
1,give me a break,"I enjoyed ""Temple"" but this book was just awful. Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes. You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time. In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure. 1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him. and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear. Right. The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.Read ""Temple"" instead."
5,A seat burner from start to finish,"Area 7 is the latest book from one of Australia's best new thriller authors. Tom Clancy may have lost a few steps, but Matthew Reilly is there to take his place!Area 7 has a very clever plot centered around one of Reilly's recurring characters, Shane Scofield. The President of the USA has a transmitter on his heart. If his heart stops, then terror will be unleashed on the world. It's up to Scofield to protect the President and save the world.The book never lets up. From the first sentence, the characters are off and running. Reilly has a very good writing style and he can maintain the level and pace of action with seemingly very little effort.It's been a while since a thriller has captivated me quite like Area 7. It combines the best elements of a Tom Clancy thriller with the action level of a Michael Crichton novel.An A+ all around"
1,Beyond rationality,"This book is totally absurd. Yeah, it's got a lot of action, but if it's not supposed to be science fiction, then it should touch base with reality occasionally, and it doesn't. However, if utterly ridiculous plots, hair-raising, unbelievable, nick-of-time escapes from death and destruction, and burning incense to feminism are your thing, then by all means get this book. But if you like your action stories to be semi-believable and rational, then avoid this book like....like....like....the Sinovirus......"
1,Realism...who needs it?,"I thought Reilly had pushed the limits of silliness with ""Ice Station."" At least, the level of annoyance among readers would surely prevent any further publications by this author. Alas, this was not to be. The author returns with yet another offering of acceptable literary skill combined with a total lack of research and common sense. I will say only that any reader possessing any brain activity whatever should spend their book money elsewhere. There are many excellent authors and worthy stories to entertain everyone out there. This book, like other Reilly stories, will likely leave only a bad taste among readers, and regret at time wasted reading it."
1,Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the library,"Mr. Reilly requires only one thing of a reader...the ability to ignore fact and absolutely suspend belief. If you can accomplish that, his books will in fact keep you involved. If, however, you require even a modicum of reality in your stories, this will be as disappointing as 'Ice Station', if no more so. It will probably appeal to the PS2 and X-box crowd, but if you seek a military style techno-thriller that you can read without stopping every two pages to wonder at the inaccuracies, try Tom Clancy or Harold Coyle."
4,Exciting Close-Quarters Action,"I'm a huge fan of military book whether they be fiction or nonfiction. I'm also a big fan of tactical action games, so it's no surprise I enjoyed this book very much. I actually read it before Ice Station (the first Scarecrow novel), but enough background information is given to easily follow along. Although the character development is a bit under par, the amount of action more then makes up for it. Not a very deep, but a very good read."
1,Rubbish,I wish it were possible to give a zero star rating. On many occasions I almost threw this book in the bin. But that wouldn't be honouring the trees that went into making it so I finished it for their sakes. What a waste of time.
2,"Cheaply made, would be a cute item at $8 or $9.","My nephew wanted this for Christmas, so I purchased it. For the cost, I really expected a miniaturized version of the real thing. What I got was a plastic helmet with decals that weren't even fully adhered.The packaging is nice. The inside plastic creates a display case for the helmet.Still, the look and feel of the helmet is like something I'd see on the sale aisle at a discount store for $8.99 or less.If this wasn't a present he specifically requested, I would definitely return this."
5,Excellent Christmas Movie,I saw this years ago on TV. It is one of the best movies I have seen for expressing what the Christmas spirit is really about.
2,Juggler of Notre Dame,"I was so excited to see this again, but the DVD skips and it makes it too hard to watch."
1,SELLER SUX!!!,"I have contacted the seller 3 times over the past week, and NO RESPONSES! NOT customer service as far as I am concerned! Not pleased!"
5,Worked for me!,I saved a lot of $ by purchasing this older edition rather than the required text for my class. So far everything has been fine as far as material matching up and key concepts. Completely worth it for me and I would recommend.
1,Outhouse Material At Best!,"If and when the ""great toilet paper shortage"" of the 21st century comes, I will be able to take solice in the fact that this useless (and racist) book is on my shelf for those times of need!"
4,Textbook,I received by textbook before the schedule arrival date. The book is in excellent condition. I've only read chapter one so far and it was very interesting to my surprise. I anticipated that the class would be boring but not anymore.
4,Expedient,"I appreciate the time frame in which this book was shipped to me. It arrived in about 1 wk or less. It was very much needed for my online college course, and it came right on time. Keep up the good work."
5,Must Read for Leaders and Managers,This is a must for leaders and managers. The two factor theory is critical for understanding the motivations of employees. That is why I bought this second copy for my personal library. I never lend out my original copy.
1,Paul Hardcastle - king of cheese,"Wow this is easily some of the worst ""smooth jazz"" cheese I have ever heard. True jazz folks must be rolling in their graves."
1,not worth it,the context is obsolete.The photo is rather unclear. There is nothing new or revolutional about this book especially about chest and shoulder training.My advice is simple .It's not worth the money.
3,"Somewhat useful, but incomplete, reference","This early work on old time radio is loaded with program data and a section of obscure photograhs, but is not comprehensive. For example, the long-running detective show Broadway's My Beat is not listed. Some of the alphabetical entries provide scant information, while others provide names not easily found elsewhere. It is obvious that this book was published prematurely, but there is still a wealth of information. There is almost no narrative. Maybe Dragnet's Sgt. Friday told them, ""Just the facts!"" There are many newer reference works available, including John Dunning's Encyclopedia of Old Time Radio."
2,Radio for Data Lovers,"Pages and pages of data detail on the cast, writers, etc. but very little on the personalities or good stuff on the shows. There's nothing here to tell why this is radio's ""Golden Age,"" so I promptly donated this book to my local library. The other books on radio from Amazon are a lot more satisfying. And I grew up listening to radio shows and music, so I used my imagination far more than when TV shows came along."
1,Flimsy compass,"I received this item (Brunton 8010G, Classic) in two pieces insideits plastic packaging, which was undamaged. The baseplate and thecompass housing (the middle part) were separated. I opened the packageand reinserted the compass housing into the baseplate. At the slightesttap of the fleshy part of my finger tip, the compass housing fell out.I'm pretty sure this shouldn't happen...I called Amazon and was helped by a courteous support person.They'll take this thing back and will cover the return shipping.I've already ordered a new compass from Silva."
2,Pay MUCH attention to Johnny Rock!,"That Rock guy hit it right on the head. This is one of the very worst attempts at metal, or music for that matter, that I've heard in a long while. The drumming is lousy, and the solos are the biggest jokes I've ever heard. The songs are WAY too long (and I say that because it's too many minutes of bad music...personally I like long, GOOD, epic songs). In short, this band is even funnier that Spinal Tap because unlike Tap, they are actually trying to take themselves seriously. Spend your money on a Death CD, or try to track down Cynic's CD ""Focus."""
5,DREAMSCAPE,"Discovering Paradise Lost after Icon was relased, I was immediately hooked. Moving backwards, their evolution is clear.... songs such as As I Die, Pity the Sadness, and No Forgiveness demonstrate the orchestrated guitar parts and goth overtones of the band< with lyrics that provide insight to pain we have all felt at some point or another. In all, the album is an awesome dreamscape of a tired soul."
4,1 mystery soved...,"The book was great! Thats what. The book will catch your interest till the end of index. Although the the book could have been more interesting by telling a breif story about each creature. This book will tell you about the Lockness monster, the giant squid and me I truly suggest you read this book."
5,Sachse is the friggin man,"I have the english translation of this book, and i'll say it was the best [money] i have ever spent. Sachse is a master bladesmith/blacksmith in the highest sense. Not only can this man make beautiful and varied styles of damascus steel, most makers seem to stick to one or two particular styles, but he has meticulously researched the history of both the patterns and how they were made. In many cases he has remade the historical styles himself. Also the book is filled with rare and colorfull pictures of damascus, and wootz steel objects. This includes everything from, what you would expect to find, like knives, guns, and swords to more unusual objects like armour and jewelry. The information in this book is helpfull whether or not you are an expert or a novice. Get ahold of this book if you can - It'll change your life!"
1,I got what I paid for which was crap,"I looked all over the place for a battery to go in our thermometer and could never find them. This is the right size so I bought it and was hoping it would work and the price was right. Well, it worked....once. I put the battery in and turned it on and it was fine. Went to use it this weekend and it was dead. The only time it worked was the first day I installed this batter. The thing hardly had any charge at all. What a joke. Save your money."
1,Dead,"I purchased two lithium batteries, in case one happened to be a dud. Unfortunately both were. The first dead before I even attempted to use it and the second only lasted for one use."
1,Questionable,"perhaps there is something wrong with my thermometer, but i put these batteries in and not even two weeks later they were dead. i haven't tried any other batteries in it to see if the same thing happens again."
4,Happy to with this hard to find Battery!,I recieved it fast and like the fact that the shipping was free b/c it was mailed in an envelope with a stamp!!:)
2,Children Deserve Better Than This,"A good selection of classics that children will recognize - singing along is encouraged by the children's chorus. Helpful liner notes discussing the history of nursery rhymes and lyric sheet included.Although the singing is quite good, the accompanying music is awful - a single keyboard attempts to stand in for all the instruments and effectively cheapens the entire production, making it sound amateurish and flat - simple piano or acoustic guitar would've been a huge improvement. Children deserve better than this (as do parents who will inevitably have to listen to this too)."
3,Do not get mixed up,"I purchased this album full price thinking it had the female vocalist from the Black Symphony album. It does not, it has a male. This is not a bad album,the production is very good but I was expecting something more along the lines of the newer one,with it catchy,fudgey, guitar riffs. If your looking for some of the best black,death metal with a chick singing then I highly recommend purchasing the Black Symphony. Only get anphisbena if you are a die hard opera ix fan like myself."
1,Rough material,"Normally I don't leave reviews of amazon purchases, but I was so disappointed with this item I thought I should. I ordered the blue dot percale bumper, and I was disappointed with the quality, feel and appearance of the fabric. The fabric was rough to the touch and the ""dots"" looked like they were printed on the fabric instead of part of the fabric. It was so rough that I would never use it in a baby's crib, and I think the fabric would be uncomfortable even for an adult. I also ordered the American Baby Company crib jersey sheet and chenille changing pad cover, and both of those were great. I think this particular fabric is just not right for a baby or any item of baby bedding."
1,Save your money,"Cheap, not soft or durable. Looks like it's going to fall apart. One set of string ties long the top of the bumper so you cannot even secure it to the crib. Save your money"
4,nice bumper,"I like this bumper. I like that they had solid colors and it fit the crib perfectly. Only thing i recommend is to watch it carefully if you wash it in a standard washing machine- mine the padding scrunched together in a small section, its not too noticeable though. Other than that its a nice crib bumper and i recommend it."
4,excellent critical review of progress under CWA.,"CWA literature is overwhelming, dense, and confusing. This book is a refreshing change - the progress under the Clean Water Act is presented in a very simple manner. Good for basic technical and legal understanding of the subject. EPA and state-level programs and reports are brilliantly critiqued (no wonder, the book is produced by NRDC!). The text is supported by excellent research of legislative history of the CWA.Only Chapter 2 (out of 8 chapters) is a little dull. In Chapter 2, the figures could have been more illustrative, and the discussion of numbers could have been livelier. Overall, the most interesting and understandable book on CWA."
1,Zero Stars would be the actual score,"Beign a fan of acoustic or electro acoustic guitars made me buy this album. I have a good collection of CD's by such guitar greats as Steve Hackett, Anthony Phillips, Paco de Lucia, Andres Segovia, Strunz & Farah, Ottmar Leibert, Peter White, Earl Klugh among others. This has to be the worst guitar album in history. The whole CD sounds like a musician practicing or trying to tune the guitar. It like a warm up that never gets going. And the quality of the recording is so bad, that sounds like an amateur was in charge. Stay away from this CD and from this artist."
2,Very Painful!,"I got this vac because the Merry Maids who clean my house on occasion use this vacuum. They recommended it. When I got it, I used it for the first time and ended up with a stiff neck and an aching shoulder. The second time, the latch had broken off the back and I had to rig up a way to keep the dust container closed. And then there was another couple of days of aches and pains. I guess the people who rave about this vac are a lot younger or stronger than I am, but I am giving mine away. I would recommend staying away from this machine."
1,BEWARE,"I recently purchased this product and was very disappointed. I have called and emailed ""Discount Cleaning Products"" several times. There is only a recording on the telephone number that says everybody is busy. None of my messages have been returned. I asked for authorization to return and have been informed by email that my machine may not be returned as it is used. I informed that I used for 3 minutes only to try. Have not received a reply since in spite of several emails and phone calls. THIS VACUUM DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES. I don't know who writes the positive reviews but they must be Hoover executives."
5,Great portable vacuum,I bought my original portapower about 30 years. I was heartbroken when the motor konked out last year. I went on ebay to see if anyone was selling theirs and found they are still being made as commercial machines. I have had the new one for several months and love it even more than the original. It has tremendous power for a little vac and is pretty easy to carry around. Great for stairs. The only thing I don't like is the thick electrical cord attached to it. It is cumbersome. I would highly recommend this machine. It is worth its weight!
5,Problem Solved!,"What a great concept - so simple, but so effective. Initially I thought the box was a bit pricey, but after the first day I knew it was a wise investment. The natural curiousity of my two Siamese cats had them using their new box in a matter of minutes. I must admit we had a few chuckles seeing the head pop out of the top too. No more ""snacking"" for my two Malteses and no more messy litter bits and poorly aimed ""deposits"" from my girls. Buy it - my bet is you will be as pleased as I am."
5,Great Idea,I think this cat box is a fantastic idea. As soon as I saw it I knew that I had to have one. I hunted for it online and ordered it immediately.As far as the cats' (I have 4) opinions go they're not too impressed. They've used it a little bit but seem to prefer the more traditional type. I'll continue offering it as a choice and maybe they will learn to like it better. I'm wondering if it's because they are all at least 6 years old and old habits die hard.
4,Best one I've used yet,"I am very happy with this litter box, and my cat took to it immediately. The thing I like the most is that it catches most of the litter off my cat's feet onto the lid and I have very little on the floor around the box now, which was my biggest complaint about my other litter boxes. It's very easy to clean; the rounded corners help in this regard. Also, I can often scoop out his jobs without even having to take off the lid. Like I said, best one I've used yet."
5,Good litter box,"This product is roomy and discreet and it took no time at all for my cats to begin using it, both of my cats seem to enjoy the privacy. There is definitely less litter tracked around, but I was a bit disappointed to still need to sweep it up every third day or so.On a separate note, I did not like the liners at all, they seemed pointless, other than to get in the way."
1,Works only depending on cat(s) & can create behavioral issues,"I switched from my dome style pan w/steps to the Clevercat Top Entry Litterbox to cut down on litter tracking. My older cat is a litter flinger, and my Siamese girl is a bolter, spraying litter everywhere.My Siamese girl LOVED the Top Entry style box, and used it obsessively. However, my older cat is around 15 lbs, and found it difficult to maneuver in. Additionally, my Siamese girl thought that my older cat's usage of the box turned the contraption into a giant version of a whack-a-mole game, and would ambush him as my older cat used it. This finally resulted in my older cat refusing to poo in the new box, even when I removed the lid and left the box open. That was the last straw for me. It's back to my old box for me."
1,Didn't work for my purpose,"For the most part, my cat used the box but he didn't like it. Eventually, he decided the floor was better than going through the hole in the top.But, the reason I got this box was for my dog-to keep him out of the litter box. Well, he just learned to stick his head through the hole. When he pulled his head out, the lid would just hang around his neck.It didn't work for us."
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this pan because my cat squats right inside the door to her regular covered litter pan, hangs her bottom over the edge, and pees on the floor. I bought a pan with a high side but she still can't keep everything inside. I hoped the Clevercat design would prevent spillover, but Ginger just bypassed the middle step and peed directly on the floor when confronted with this product. I tried it both with the top off and on, and it didn't seem to make any difference. It looked like a good idea, it just didn't work with my cat. FWIW, she's sixteen years old - a younger cat might take to it more readily."
3,A bit disappointed,"After all the good reviews of this product, I was disappointed with the CleverCat, and prefer my old litter box.The cats used it fine, though I found 2 design flaws. Firstly, the bottom of the box is indented, while the corners are not. So, if the cats go deep in the corners, the clumped litter gets stuck in there and it's difficult to get it out. Also, the top is a little stiff to remove.However, tracking is definitely reduced..."
4,My Dogs Finally Figured It Out!,I've had these boxes for years (I replace them yearly for sanitary purposes). I think they're great but they do get messy. The cats still have a tendency to go right underneath the opening which has them stepping in/out the messed area. The one star drop however is because my small dogs have finally figured out how to get in. Granted it took them years to figure it out and they were defeated by my placing the boxes behind a gate. But then again - I could've put any boxes behind a gate and my cats could've used the whole open space more easily.
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this litter box because it was the only one that others said could keep cat poop loving dogs away. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. In addition, almost every time my cat uses it, when he jumps out he knocks it over and we hear a boom! Needless to say, the cat doesn't like that, so he often prefers to use the bathroom floor. Bottom line, I'm returning the box and going back to a conventional litter box that doesn't require the cat to jump in and out."
4,Clevercat Top Entry Litterbox,"I ordered this product after seeing a top entry litter box my son had purchased from another company. This box is much plainer than the box they purchased, which was a glossy orange color, but for the difference in price (this was $34, the box they purchased $100), I think I got the better deal. The box is basically a storage box with a hole on top, but what makes it work is there are grooves on the lid to catch the litter. It came with one liner, and additional liners are available. I ended up removing the liner, which was basically a garbage bag. It works much better without the liner, which would not stay put and kind of scared my cats. I am a fanatic about keeping the box clean, so no liner does not bother me. I am quite pleased with box, though I think the price could still be much less. That is my only complaint, but I would recommend this box."
2,Cats very rarely use it,"I've had this litter box for a couple of years now, and my 3 cats almost never use it. It's an interesting idea, but just doesn't seem to work."
2,Love Vs. Hate,"Love: I love this box, it's easy to take the lid off and clean. The Clevercat liners fit great too.Hate: My cat hated this box. He's 15 lbs. and it's too small in all four dimensions for him to turn around and use. He stopped using it after two days!Conclusion: After reading all the reviews i bought this box at a local pet store and had high hopes and expectations. However, having a large male cat, this is not the box for him and that made me sad."
4,Improvement for sure!,"We have used the hooded cat litter box for as long as we have owned cats. Our current cat, Peppino, is quite the disco dancer when finished with his business. His motto is ""Every defecation is a celebration!"" Our Rosey Bourke Parakeet wolf whistles in accompaniment whenever he is pooping, so it's always a party. We succumbed to buying this litter box in the hopes that it would cut down on tracking. And it has. But not completely. But a whole lot, and I only have to sweep a very small amount every two or so days, so I think it was a great improvement. Peppino seems to enjoy climbing in for complete privacy, and he can scratch and kick in there to his heart's content. It would be nice if it wasn't so utilitarian looking. Otherwise, we are very happy with it! The price is a bit more than I wished to pay, but I also agreed with another reviewer that cutting a hole in a lid of a bin would look pretty low-rent. Also could be sharp. This hole is quite large enough for our 15 lb kitty."
2,Not for My Cats!,I was so excited about this I didn't even hesitate. (Or measure) I ran out bought took it home filled it up and sat and watched. My cats love boxes as they all do. It wasn't five mins and my small kitty was in digging a hole and doing his business he is 13lbs he filled the whole box. And then if was my adult male 20lbs and he squished himself in there and tried to find a spot but just could stay it was too much for him. And he has never returned. So great idea but will be going to Lowes and making my own today in a much larger form. Because I stil have a small dog that loves the litter box:-(
3,"Less litter, more odor","This box works well with managing litter, but because of the open top the odor just goes up and out. I feel like the old dome box I had kept the odor contained.It took about 2 weeks to get them used to this new box. I had their old one set up next to it during that time. They scratched up the litter liner, so that is useless to us. It is easy enough to clean without it.I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless litter scatter was a real problem for you."
5,cat litter box,"This cat litter box is so amazing. It really does eliminate the cat litter on the floor (better then the conventional ones). Also, the dogs dont really go into it as much (little dogs). It is also a large box but it seems like its small because it is in a nice rectangle shape and fits in corners better then other boxes. I really recommend this box. it is my favorite box i have ever purchased. Yeah it is a bit expensive... but i think it is worth it."
3,Kitty refused to use it,"I'm sure that this product is great for most kitties, but mine (TK) simply wouldn't use it. She was curious, and jumped on top of it several times and even inside the box, but that was it. In fact, she was starting to have ""potty issues"" (constipation) because she seemed so distressed about this box in the place of her old one (the old one was moved over to another side of the room) so we put the clever cat away and went back to just the old box. Maybe if you start with a young kitty it is easier for them to adapt, but my girl just wasn't going to budge. It's kind of a bummer to be out the $ for the box, but perhaps we'll try it again in the future if we get another kitty to keep TK company."
5,SO happy!!,"I have been searching and searching for a good litter box. I Have been through so many and have wasted so much money. When I got this, our smaller and younger cat was all for it. She used it immediately. Our bigger, older kitty was hesitant. I kept an eye on him and now he is using it! There is no mess and it's so much easier to clean! I highly recommend it!!!!"
1,good in theory,"I changed out my cat's normal hooded litter box for this one because it looked roomier. My cat refused to use it and ended up developing a FLUTD (I'm assuming from stress and not having a comfortable place to urinate). It's a good idea in theory, but probably is not a ""clever"" design from the cat's point of view."
3,Works Okay,"I've had this litter box for a couple of years now, and I am looking to get a different one. Here's why:-Although the box's corrugated lid decreases the amount of litter on the floor, it is impossible for me to get it out of the grooves. Also, the litter area underneath the entry hole is quite exposed. This doesn't matter much if your box is hidden or located in a utility room, but unfortunately mine is not.-Difficult to scoop litter without a mess because the lid is so far above the base.-The Clevercat liners fit the box awkwardly.-Really ugly. Why hasn't anyone designed inexpensive to moderately-priced litter boxes that aren't hideous?On the plus side, my cat had no trouble going in it (he's easygoing). The other reasons to get it (a curious dog in the house, etc.) may apply to other cat owners, but the box isn't working for me."
3,Totally depends on your cat,"I've had this now for about 8 months and was pretty happy with it initially. As time has gone by, though, I've noticed more problems with it that mostly have to do with my cat's changing usage. Although this kept litter in pretty well at first, my cat eventually started jumping out to the side. When I first got it, she would get back onto the lid afterwards, which would keep her from tracking litter much onto the floor. However, she clearly doesn't like to step onto the grated part and will now jump very far out to avoid it, thus scattering litter all over.The other issue I have with it is the non-glossy surface. I'd had the Booda Dome before, and really liked that it was so smooth that clumps came off very easily from its sides. I've found that with this one, I have to scrape a lot more when emptying and cleaning. I might be trying the Cleanstep next."
3,Somewhat better than traditional litter boxes,"I own two cats and have two litter boxes--one Clevercat and one front-entry. One cat tends to leap out of the Clevercat and scatter litter everywhere, so it doesn't really work when he uses it. The other stops on top of the lid of the Clevercat on her way out, which reduces her litter scatter. Bottom line: you won't be able to tell how your cat will react until it uses the box. I'd say it's very slightly better than a front-entry box, but not good enough to purchase another."
4,it works!,"I have 3 cats with 3 different litter habits and I tried all kind of boxes: the robotic self-cleaning worked well except that Stitch would hop in while the thing was turning (he's fascinated about these things), so the robot gave up and became unreliable. Stitch also sticks his butt up high when the litter box isn't at its cleanest and squirts over the rim. Harry is a digger and throws litter all over. So, ah-ha I thought! this clever box should work (I already resigned to the idea that I would have to go back to manual scooping). But then Dexter (a tortured little rescue soul!) decided to pee above everyone on the Clevercat box lid! He's afraid of being trapped in that box.So I use the Clevercat box without the lid and presto: problems solved. Stitch can't squirt that high and Dexter won't feel trapped and Harry can dig without throwing litter all over. Perfect!I'm going to try the liners -- I still haven't given up on making my life easier, too."
5,Keeps Dogs Out,Cats had no problem taking to this new litter box...and now I don't have to worry about the dogs sneaking in to eat unmentionables!
4,I love it!,"I've had this litter box for about a week now and I am LOVING it! I was having a big problem with litter being tracked everywhere and kicked out of the litter box all over the place before I got the Clevercat. I even had a litter box with high sides and it was still a problem. The amount of litter tracked out of this box is so much less now. I only have to sweep once a day and even then, there isn't much to sweep. My two cats took to it right away so no problems there. I am taking off 1 star because for $35, I would expect a bigger box. It's certainly tall enough, but the length/width could definitely be bigger. $35 is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. :)"
4,No more cat litter out of the box,"Our biggest problem with other boxes is that the cats would kick the cat litter out of the box... Not fun to pickup. We have tried more than a few types of boxes, higher doors or some kind of fancy this or that. But this box has been the BEST and probably the solution to our problem. It's basically a ""Rubber-Maid"" container with a hole in the lid. The cats have to jump in and out of the box which keeps them from kicking litter out of the hole because it's on top.I would highly recommend this box to anyone who has cats that like to kick/cover their litter."
4,works great!,"i love this litter box, definitely does what it claims to do. my cat is middle aged and a bit over weight, but he had no trouble adjusting. it really makes sharing a small space with a cat much more comfortable. some reviews say that it is smelly, i haven't found that (no smellier than an other litter box, duh!) the only thing i'd like to point out is that location is key with this box. my last apartment i put it in a corner and it worked fantastic. now in my new home i still have boxes everywhere and my cat has been able to track some litter out, but still much improved over other boxes. so if you have a good corner for it you won't be disappointed. i've bought this same box 3 times in total"
5,Works great for our needs.,"The top entry litterbox solved a problem we had been having for a long time. We have a 5lb. pomeranian dog who took to eating cat poop in the last year. She craved the stuff so much that if we weren't paying attention she would follow the cat to the litterbox to see what was cooked up. This product solved everything. The only thing we have now is a pom going through poop withdrawal. Oh, and the cat had no problems adjusting to the new box."
4,Good product,It stopped the cat from throwing litter (and turds) on the floor. I use heavy-duty garbage bags (33 gallon yard/leaf bags) instead of buying the more expensive clevercat brand.
2,Good idea in theory,"I have one cat, and my roommates have a kitten, so between the two of them, there is a lot of litter box ambushing. The kitten plays in the litter box, so I wanted something that would eliminate the need to sweep 1-2 times a day around the litter box (especially because roommates won't do it).I did a lot of homework on this, and I decided to give it a shot. I wasn't sure if it'd work because my cat is picky about where he ""goes"" (after failed toilet training), so I lined it in plastic (before I realized it comes with a complementary liner)in a test run.The cats refused to use it. They both sniffed it out but decided the floor right in front of it was a better place. Unused, I returned it. In theory, it looks like a good idea, but it didn't work for my kitties."
3,Construction is good; Cat never got used to it,"I tried and tried to get my cat to use this litter box. She never showed even remote interest in it. Lid. No lid.We eventually went back to a standard box, and she did fine with that.The paradigm shift was just to great for a 13 year old cat."
4,Product works great,"We needed to keep our idiot dog from getting into the litter box (nasty) and this product seemed like the best, most affordable solution. The cat was wary of it and would not go for about a day, but he warmed up to it, and it is working great. If you have idiot dogs with a taste for cat doody, this box should work great."
2,Clevercat Litterbox,"Sorry, this was a clever idea but it's a 'no' from me. The cats (I have 3) all got used to it very quickly with no problems, but my problem was that because of how it is made (depth-wise) and with only the round hold for ventilation on one side, that the urine smell was overpowering in a very short period of time. Again, the concept is great in preventing litter tracked all over your floors, but it needs a better system of ventilation. I'll take the sweeping over the ammonia smell anyday!"
2,My Cat Does Not Like It,"If my cat would like this box, so would I. I read all the positive reviews here. But my Siamese cat screams whenever he has to go. I thought he must have urinary tract infection. But no, he just hates jumping down into this thing. And he is in such a hurry to get out, he doesn't cover his stinky poop. (He does with a regular box.) Too bad. It's a great design. It's my temperamental cat that is the problem, but I can't take him back! (And I wouldn't want to.)."
3,Depends on your cat.,"I have 2 large (17 lb) cats who tend to tip over the front door style boxes. For one of my cats, this was the perfect box. He could scratch and fling and there was no tracking. Perfect. Our other cat was a different story. She did not like going down into the box and at first she was clever and sat on the top and did her business into the hole, just like using a toilet. Good kitty!!! But then, she got sloppy and would just go anywhere on the top of the box. Ick. Bad Kitty!!! That was the end of that. Since it's just a glorified rubbermaid box, it now holds kindling wood in our garage. So, if it hadn't been for our stupid cat,this would have been the perfect litter box. Oh well, I'm still looking."
5,Clean floors and no dog treats,This has been the best litter box for us. With both a dog and a cat inside the challenge of keeping the dog away from the litter box while giving the cat access seemed impossible to overcome.The cat took to this box the day we began using it. The litter that normally would be tracked to the floor from the cats feet stays on the lid of this box and the dog cannot reach in to get that most desireable snack.
1,Save your money,"They are right. This works very well, but you dont need to pay $24 for it. My dogs never managed to eat cat poo again after I simply cut a whole in the top of any rubber tub with a lid. Six bucks and youre set!"
2,"It's been ""retired""","My 20 lb cat kept knocking it over.... not stable from the side at all. Also the grooves in the lid kept getting litter stuck in them.... I know having litter in the grooves is part of what it's supposed to do... but that it would get STUCK there and I had to go after it with a scrub brush almost daily was really not helpful. Between having to right it on a regular basis (and clean up the litter that spilled out when it tipped to the side), and having to scrub the top of it... it was a hassle. Also scooping it was a pain for me and scooping down to that depth actually bothered my elbow quite a bit..... so it was literally a pain. I can see where it might work great for some, but a base to stabilize it side-to-side and either an open grid at the top so that the litter could fall through, or a different design on top so the litter didn't stick in the grooves would have made a world of difference."
1,"Terrible for cats, way too small. Returned mine. :(","Terrible for cats, they need room to move & this box is way too small. Returned mine. It needs a much larger hole in the top, then it might not be so constrictive for kitty."
2,Save yourself some money!,"I have a cat who is incapable of keeping his pee inside a normal litter box. So I set out to find an extra deep litter box. This box works fine but one of my cats can't figure out how to go in through the hole on the top, so I had to take the lid off.Then I found a Sterilite 18-Gallon Tote Box at Walmart for around $10. It comes with a lid, so you can just cut a whole in it yourself and save yourself $25! I bought it just to have another litter box in the house (I have 3 cats) and it works great! I wish I didn't spend the $35 on the first one!This product has a good concept but is a complete rip off!"
4,Might just be worth it,"My sister had mentioned the idea of a ""top loading"" litter box on a visit after she listened to me lament tripping over the gate to my laundry room designed to keep my dogs from exploring the litter box. I hesitated spending so much (3x what I have paid on covered boxes) but I have to say, I am quite pleased with this item.1) It does the job of keeping the dogs out2) There noticeably less litter tracked out of the box3) Unlike two piece covered boxes if my cat sprays the side of the box it does not leak between the two pieces making cleaning up after my cats much easierThe box is about the same size as the covered litter box I had previously. I was afraid my cats might not use it as it is so different from the other models but both took to it without issue. The only reason I did not rate as 5 stars is due to the high cost. In the end I found it was worth not having to trip over a gate."
2,Depends on the cat I guess,Well this litter box did cut down on the amount of litter being spread about the house....that is one good thing that happened.The problem is it is WAY too small. If your cat has any persnickety litter box habits then I would not recommend it.My one cat decided that she hated the litter box and started peeing all over the house. I had to purchase a new litter box to rectify the peeing situation. Not after much damage was wreaked upon the house though.So buyer beware....it could lead to upset cats.
4,Works great,"Cats took to it almost immediately. Works better with litter poured fairly deep. Somehow, I seem to use less litter, too. Much less tracking than with the conventional box. Would like for it to be a bit bigger, but my 15-pounders seem to get in and out OK."
5,Best box so far,"It's been less than a week since I received this box and my cats are adapting to it just fine (I have 3). Unfortunately the only place in the house for the cat box is in my office, and I work from home. Fed up with litter tracking everywhere, and the smell, and the dog who thinks cat poop is tasty, this box has changed my life! There is so much less tracking, the dog can't get to it, and it seems to contain the smell pretty well also. I also received a Litter Locker in the same order, which I love just as much. Thanks!!!"
2,My Cats Won't Use It,I have two small female cats who have never had any trouble adapting to a new litter box...until I bought this one. They decided they didn't like it and would rather start peeing in the carpeted corners of my house. We're going back to the Booda Dome which has been their favorite by far. I gave it two stars because it is a well-made product and would probably work well for those just starting out with a new kitten that might adapt to it more easily if they haven't gotten used to any other type of litter box yet.
5,Great box! Less mess and keeps poop away from dog.,"This simple design is perfect. We just got rid of our Bhudda dome style box for this one. The Bhudda box was such a huge mess- the litter just poured out of the little set of stairs all over our floor. This top entry box solves that problem quite easily. I was a little nervous about my cat being able to get used to this new box, but she took to it immediately and is doing great with it. Our cat is an adult female who is in decent shape as she likes to chase our little Chihuahua around who chases her right back. I suppose if she were an older cat or very overweight, this box might pose a problem. I love that we don't have to take any additional steps to keep our little dog from getting in there to retrieve and eat the cat poop. Why he'll eat that, but won't eat a scrap of meat dropped on the floor by my tot, I'll never understand. Anyway, this box is well worth it. I haven't tried the liners yet but that's next."
2,A risky purchase ....,"I thought this was an excellent idea, but with two cats and two litter boxes, we only have one cat that will use it."
5,Best litter box ever.,"In a house with 4 dogs and 2 cats, keeping the dogs out of the litter box while keeping the cats happy with the box was a long ongoing battle that the animals were winning. Then I discovered these. Cats used them with very little adjustment, and are tracking less litter out of the box, and I am pleased to say the dogs large (lab), medium (beagles) and small (little mutt) are all very frustrated! Easy to clean and maintain. I will never buy another kind of lifter box!"
4,Well Designed Product,"This is a well designed, simple and sturdy product -- mostly importantly it works great for our cats! Seems like it cuts down ""tracking"" as well."
2,No for my cat...too small!,"It was a great idea, but my adult cat is long/tall and was bigger than the litter box. He could not turn around and barely fit through the opening. I think for kittens it would work well because it seems to keep the dog out and track less litter than the Booda which I currently use. I had no problems returning the product thankfully. Did not like the liner it didn't fit well. Wish they would have an extra-large size in the future..."
5,works great,"I have two cats and two miniature Dachshunds. With other litter boxes, they would get in the litter. With the Clevercat, they have not even tried. And the cats took right to it. Really solved this problem!"
4,Adjustments for kittens,Trying to keep our dog out of our new kitten's old litter box was a hassle. The Clevercat box has done the trick. The only problem has been our eight week old kitten is so small she couldn't easily get in or out of the box. I finally put a step stool next to the box so she can climb up and filled up the box more than half way with litter so she can climb out. Would have been nice for the instructions to give a bit of guidance for kittens.
2,Clever idea. Same cannot be said for the buyers!,This IS a great idea. Paying this price is not. I accomplished the same thing by buying a sturdy 18-gallon tote on sale and cutting a hole in the lid (about the size of a dessert plate is good).
3,"Unh, a little bit over priced considering...","You can buy a plastic box at Walmart (>5$)Buy some sharp scissors or a knife (>2$)Cut a hole in the lid of the plastic box (your labor = free and rewarding!)Surround any sharp edges of the hole with ducktape(>5$)Add a litter pan inside (>2$)And bam, you have the same thing, home made, for a grand total of ~14$. LESS THEN HALF OF WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE CHARGING.So, if its worth paying 20.95$ more for a product that looks slightly nicer and was assembled when you got it to you, then by all means, buy this product. Power to you. You may also enjoy a drastic drop in the chances you will cut yourself on a home project!Personally, this looks like a great product to me, but I'd rather make it at home then spend 34.95$ on it."
3,Dog can still get inside.,"I've been desperately looking for a litter box to deter my dog from looking for a snack. This was not it. It does slightly deter her, but since she is a large breed dog, she can easily just stick her nose inside. On a positive note I have two cats, each about ten pounds, and they both took to the box immediately. The floor does stay a lot cleaner than with our old box because the design does a good job at keeping the liter inside. The box is a little smaller than the old box I used to use, so I do have to clean it about twice as much as I used to, which is not really a big deal for me. Overall, I like the box, I would get it again, but it did not solve my hungry dog problem."
3,Maybe better for people than cats,"I've had this deep kitty litter box for 4 or 5 years. Because I have 3 cats who are confined to my bedroom & master bath (keeps the dog from devouring their food) I added it as a second box. The alternative is a conventional covered box. My cats use the conventional box by a factor of well more than 10 to 1 uses.In addition, this won't take readily available liners. When I first got the Clevercat box at a local pet store they carried a specially fitted liner but they dropped the boxes and that was that.Perhaps if it's the only choice cats would adapt to it. But I wouldn't want to take the chance that they'd find their own alternatives. Meanwhile, litter does collect on the textured top so you need to take some care in removing the top to clean the litter. And there's still some sweeping up to do around the box as well. Not nearly so much as for a conventional box but this thing is no miracle solution either."
5,Best litterbox!,"We've had Fritz for over nine years. We spent the first five years trying to find a litterbox that didn't create a mess. This one is perfect. We have two of these in the house, and Fritz took to it immediately. And best of all, there's no mess.Tip: Instead of purchasing the replacement liners, we've found that black garbage bags work out great. If the bag is too large, just drape it over the side of the box; and the lid will hold it in place. Cleanup is a breeze."
4,Easy test before purchase,"First....I give this litter box 4 stars instead of 5 for the exorbitant price. It's plastic and costs pennies to make. The Big Box ""pet-company"" store has one for $5 less.Next....prior to purchasing this, do an easy test to see if your cats will go for the top entry. Tape up a sturdy box and cut a hole inside. Don't put litter in it of course, but just see if your cats will jump in and trust it.One of my cat's did. The other wasn't interested, even when I placed him on top and pointed him to the hole. Thank goodness he uses it now, but it took him a while.Ideally, I would rather the hole be in the middle so there is an even ledge on both sides."
2,Not good for fat or picky cats,"Bought two of these for my two cats because i thought it would solve the problem of litter being kicked out. First off, they were not okay with the lid, so that had to be removed. Then my fat cat just didn't like having to jump in there so he started peeing else where - had to go back to a regular box for him. Basically paid over $30 for two regular bins that only one cat will willingly use."
2,"The cats like it, but...","The cats both LEAP straight out of the box, scattering litter further than before. :("
5,Best litterbox ever,"I got this box to stop my little dog from sampling the ""cat treats."" I've owned a few different styles of litter boxes, but this is the best ever. She got used to it very quickly, and I think she really enjoys the privacy. The ridges in the top catch most of the litter when she hops out, so there is very, very little tracking. Best of all, it really does contain odors! And, for something so big, it's really very unobtrusive. I've had the open litter boxes, and the front entry kind, but with a small 6 lb. dog, none of those kept him out!This one does."
1,Not humane,"Unless you clean your litter box twice a day, or if you have multiple cats, this litterbox is not a good choice. Some cats don't like the confinement and if you have a dominant cat that hovers, he or she might attack the other cat as they go in or come out. The less dominant animal will become frightned. Also, cats like their potties clean and will not (and should not have to) jump down into a soiled litterbox that they cannot see into. Do some research first."
1,Not good for cats,"This type of litter box would be very hard on cats and their joints. Imagine how hard it would be to jump out of a hole while standing in sand. Now imagine how hard it would be for your cat, especially heavier or older cats. What if you have more than one cat? I couldn't imagine jumping down into a ""toilet"" into another cats waste. Just not a good idea."
1,"Liket it or not, it's yours.","One of my cats did not adapt to this new design despite several days to get used to it. So, I contacted Amazon for an RMA# and was put in touch with the supplier who refused the return though well within the 30 days. Though plastic is easily cleanable and stands up well even to anti-bacterial cleaners, the seller deemed it unreturnable once used. Even though I used a cat pan liner and left all the unattractive advertising stickers that came plastered all over it. No help from Customer Service."
1,It is a tote with hole people.,I wish i would have come up with this idea. It is TOTE with a hole in the top. Get a tote for 10 bucks and cut a hole in it and guess what.....you have the very same product! If you furry friend doesn't like it you out practically nothing.
1,Terrible overall idea,"I have two cats, one of whom (a ragdoll) has very furry paws and constantly flings litter when she walks out of the box. I've tried large boxes, hooded boxes, litter mats, etc., and nothing really worked until I got a deep pile throw rug to put under the box. Now when she steps out she has to walk two feet across this rug, and 99% of the litter gets trapped, and doesn't get tracked all over the house.This box, on the other hand, seems like just another gimmick, and a very bad idea for cats. Cats shouldn't have to contort themselves to jump down into their litterbox, and especially for older cats, this can be difficult and may encourage them to go to the bathroom elsewhere. Also, this box is simply not big enough for the average-sized cat to do it's business and not step in it when it's done.Overall, a very bad idea."
3,Clevercat Top Entry Litter Box,"The product is excellent for small cats. Big cats (13 lbs) can use it too but it is too narrow for them to turn around easily. However, I use the box without the cover as it is very high and no accidents spill when my big cat(13 lbs) goes to the bathroom in it - which is a problem I had with low boxes. I wish the box was a little wider and taller so that I could use the cover as well. I check the box 4 times a day and I believe that this product is a product to be purchased by people who will check and clean the box often, since it has a cover it gives a clean look and people who do not check the box several times a day may overlook cleaning it when necessary. In conclusion, if this box was taller and wider I would have given it a 5 star rating."
3,You can make one for less than 1/2 the price,"We took a Rubbermaid container and cut 1/2 the top off with a razor. We gorilla glued a catmat on the other 1/2 of the lid. It has worked great and was obviously cheaper! While I don't think $30 is bad for the convenience of ending ""spillage"", I was worried that our cat might not use it (like one reviewers) and we would have wasted our money!"
1,My clever cats tipped this litter box over,"This litter box didn't work for me. After about 2 minutes of sniffing around, my cat put her paws on top of the box, which immediately caused it to tip over -- it's not very stable and it's top heavy, so it didn't take much. Also, since the top doesn't really latch on, the litter went everywhere.In theory this could be a good product, but the Clevercat people have some refinement to do."
4,Nice Litter Box But Size Might Be A Problem For Some,Good litter box but might be too small for some cats. The liner that comes with it seems to fit nicely and the top entry design does seem to limit the amount of litter on the floor. If this was a bit larger I think it would be perfect.
1,Not for BIG cats,"I bought this as a 2nd choice because the box that I wanted was not in stock at the pet store. It's nice in that a lot of litter doesn't spill out BUT once I put the top on they peed and pooped on the top and not in the box. Plus you can only have a little litter in the box or they can't get in the hole, so you're filling up every few days, which is hard on the back. The big cats need lots of room to maneuver and this doesn't have it. The one I plan to go back and get is a larger style front opening litter box that has a plastic door over the opening much like a hole in the door for a dog. It was the same price as this and this is not worth the price. Now it might be okay if you had a small kitten and trained it from the get-go."
2,Not a happy kitty,I bought two of these for my 5 cats. They hated it because they had to crawl inside and then stick their head out before they could go. Instead of going in the box they went on the floor so I took the lid off and now 3 of 5 will use it. The walls are also too high for them to use comfortably. I finally bought a large box with a low end at one side and also a breeze box. They pee in the breeze box and poo in the other box with crystals. (highly recommend Tidy Cat crystals and their breeze box!)
1,no way!,"i know, i like this idea too, but my cat would not go near it. i brought it home and left it empty in the living room for a couple days so my skittish cat could investigate, get used to it. he didn't want to have anything to do with it. i then put litter in it (with a poor fitting litter bag), took his old litter box away and put the clevercat in it's palce. he would not use the clevercat and i had to put the old litter box back in place."
2,Good Concept but the cats did not like it,"I really like the concept of this cat litter. High sides to keep everything in and fairly easy to clean. However, it ultimately comes down to your cat. I have two cats, one cat would use it and the other cat would not and decided to pee outside of the box. I also experimented with a typical open kitty litter box and the Clevercat and about 95% of the time the cats would use the open litter box. I really wish they had liked it but after a couple months of trying, the two Clevercat litter boxes are now up for adoption."
3,"Good concept, but...","I bought this as a second litter box for my three cats. Not one of them would go in it with the lid on, however when I took off the lid, they started to use it. Unfortunately, it's a bit high for comfort for the oldest and the youngest cats. Also, when they leap out of it, they flick litter all over the floor. Taking the advice of another reviewer, I went down the dollar store and bought a tote bin (for $10.00) that was the roughly the same dimensions around, but about half the height and put that down. Perfect!!! The cats much prefer it to the old enter-through-the-front kitty litter box, and the scatter is reduced to a minimum."
4,WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT,"This is a very good litter box. The amount of litter on the floor around the box is drastically reduced. Our cats went right in, no problems."
3,Wish this was taller and a bit bigger,"We got this litterbox because our male bengal tends to hardly squat at all when he pees. We would end up with pee on the outside of the litterbox not to mention all the litter that was tracked all over the house. This box seems to work well to remedy those two problems. The only problem is, he doesn't like to have anything touch his back and the cover does. We ended up taking the cover off of the litterbox. This still keeps the litter inside, but we could have just used a Rubbermaid storage container to do this for about $22 cheaper. Save your money and do just that."
4,Magnaflow Exhaust,"Ordered this dual cat-back exhaust for my wife's '03 F-150 as a surprise gift. Item was received quickly, box was open as if it wasn't taped on one side. After laying out the items for installation, the tips for the exhaust were either not included or were removed prior to arrival. Contacted Amazon and they refunded 25% of entire order. The assembly was smooth and took around an hour and a half. I clamped the exhaust on and didn't worry about welding as the clamps that came with the exhaust were more than enough to keep this exhaust in place for years down to the road and I didn't want the exhaust to start rusting where the weld marks were made. As far as sound, has a good deep tone when driving and at idle it is a quiet. I recommend this product for anyone looking at purchasing a Magnaflow Cat-Back exhaust system."
1,this cd sucked,"this was the worst cd ive heard in months if there is someone on your christmas list you don't like, buy this cd for them"
4,Inexpensive but does the trick,I purchased this DVD player as a second accessory and have been pleased with its performance. It is functional and does have all the options that are desirable in an entry level DVD player. I expect to get many more viewings out of this inexpensive purchase.
5,Two Classics from Joseph Jacobs,"I'll let you in on a little secret. This is actually two of Jacobs' books published together in a nice hardbound edition from the Everyman Library. This edition includes both ""English Fairy Tales"" and ""More English Fairy Tales."" Over a century ago, Jacobs collected and adapted many tales in his lifetime and made contributions to the field of fairy tale studies. This is one of the most popular of his collections. Early variations of well-known and lesser known tales are included such as Cinderella, Three Little Pigs, Three Bears, and Tom Tit Tot (similar to Rumpelstiltskin). There are plenty more that you may have never read, too. John Batten's black and white illustrations from the original edition of the book are included."
3,"Some really good tracks, Some need work","I saw Death Ride 69 as opening act for MLWTTKK and watching the Female drummer going to town on the drums while still singing full tilt impressed me greatly. 'Penetrator' and 'Long Dirty Needle' are my two favorite tracks. except for Elvis the rest is ok to good, but I can live without the 'Elvis Christ' track. Recommend if you like MLWTTKK or NIN."
2,doesn't look like rubies,"I should have paid attention to the other review. These stones are very light almost pink. I loves the sapphire ones but am really disappointed in these. The diamonds are nice and for the price they are okay earrings. Since they are so inexpensive, I won't return them. After I pay shipping again, it's not worth it. But I won't buy from the company again."
4,Fun with an airgun.,"Mix yourself a hot Scotch and lemon and dive in. Emsworth is at his finest when confronted with the horrific possibility that he may be forced to take The Efficient Baxter on as his secretary again. Also there is a Mulliner tale, 3 golf stories as related by the the Oldest Member and 3 Ukridge stories. Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge has as usual tried everything to raise a few quid -- including renting his aunt's house while she is away in Hollywood, training Battling Billson the prize-fighter and pawning his aunt's diamond brooch. The funniest is the Emsworth story, while the others seem more like unfinished sketches that Master Plum (Wodehouse) was toying with."
5,"Wodehouse and Lambert, a wonderful pair!","I love P.G. Wodehouse. His detail, humour, so much fun! One of my favorite readers of books on tape is Nigel Lambert, he is a master voice actor. Although I am fond of Jonathan Cecil's readings of Jeeves and Wooster, Nigel Lambert manages to hold his own here. Lambert brings out the droll wit of Wodehouse, and makes me feel like I am right there with Lord Emsworth popping old Baxter with the air rifle. What a great romp!"
5,balance Point,"Balance Point is a fantastic read! An eye opening book with adventure and of ecological importance. I for one would recomend it to all high schools as a must read with a strong discussion following. The publication opens the mind, drawing the reader to desire to go further."
1,Funnier than he intended,"This reminds me of the morose, self-obsessed poetry I wrote at fourteen. Don't buy it for the ""thought""- Jenkins is sophomoric and intellectually underdeveloped. Don't buy it for the writing- Jenkin's dialogue is so bad, it will make you wince. Don't buy it for the... heck, just don't buy it."
4,stay balanced!,Balance Point is an interesting blend of spiritual and environmental revelation. This 270 page novel weaves fact and fiction in a non-judgemental way to allow the reader to come to a deeper awareness of not just the environment but oneself. It is a fast and lively read; a real page turner and while it can be finished in a couple of sittings the critical and thought provoking messages linger and linger. The book's cover is mesmerizing; the binding and typography excellent. This is a book you will want to share with friends.
5,It answered my question,"I was raised in an Episcopal church, I stopped attending when I was 16. I would not call my self a christian because of the was it was spread, who wrote the bibles, and questions that could not be answered without hearing ""you have to have faith"".I have looked into Judaism, Muslim, Hinduism, Buddhism, and found many similarities like the 10 commandments, and stories of how to get along with nature and other humans, but have always felt that organized religions were created to control the people.I was curious about what the Native American's believed, what was Earth Mother about. This book answered this question, and affirmed to me that I am on the right path, and I have a better understanding of how to get to my balance point.I found it a good book to read, and I enjoyed the way that Joe told his story."
4,Simple Vegetable Prep,The steamer does a wonderful job with cooking vegetable quickly. The only gripe I have is the loss of one of the handling rings within a month of using it (probably due to the risky practice of having my kids wash the dishes). It was easily replaced and I constantly use the steamer.
5,Will change the way you view modern rock,"This album combines unique guitar with smooth bass lines and hard hitting drums along a great rock voice. There hasn't been a full album this good in years. The album is not only different than anything out there today, but also better than anything out there, too! Any true music lover would not miss this album."
2,"Extend a seat, not for every dog or car","I just received my extend-a-seat & was eager to try it out. I have a 120lb Mastiff & take him everywhere with me, so I was looking for soemthing to make his travels in my coupe car more comfy for him.I saw other inflatable seats but went with this choice strictly because of thr lower price (the inflatable ones are about $70 opposed to this $30 one). I tested it out on a quick trip to the post office, here's what I found.Pro's:-Installation was VERY easy-seems like a durable fabric-price is rightCon's:-difficult to maneuver around if you own a 2 door car-did not hold my dogs weight at all, took less than 5 mins for him to crash thru this productI would only recommend this product for a 4 door car & a dog that weighs less than 50lbs, the pic of the lab on this is very deceiving.I will be trying the more expensive inflatable seat extender, shortly so wait for a review on that, too!"
1,extend-a-seat,"In less than a week my Labrador ended up breaking one of the cheap thin panels. Great concept. It needs higher quality, more durable, stronger panels. Stop the deceptive advertising showing a big Labrador dog on the panel."
4,Does what it's supposed to do...if you don't put too much stress on it,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is great if you have a dog that is less than, say 50 lbs or so, (or who just lays on the seat and doesn't move), and if you have four doors and don't want to move the seats (recline, reposition.) If you move the seats it might fall (and they have to be far enough back to touch the back of the seat and rest on the back seat) so you can't recline or move the seat forward or back. Other than that, it's awesome for me. I have a pack of small dogs. The ""built in barrier"" to keep dogs from jumping in the front, doesn't work. They just jump up on it and it slides down. So if you want a barrier, you need to by another one separately. But it works as a seat extender for small dogs."
1,Garbage,"My 55lb lab cracked two of the three panels within two weeks of owning this product. It is cheaply made but I guess you get what you pay for. Additionally, as many others have already stated, the middle section that is supposed to block the dog from gaining access to the front seat doesn't work and the advertised image is false unless of course your dog is doing just that, sitting 85of his/her weight on your car's seat and 15on the extend a seat. Total garbage! Purchase only if you have dogs UNDER 55 pounds."
2,concept is good,The concept is good because we were looking for something like this. I don't know that it stays in place very well; tends to slide down a little. It's made well otherwise and the straps and buckles are sturdy.
4,Kids project!,"This product is great for younger kids to do, but some may get impatient and not like it. Don't get for kids that don't like to do crafts!"
5,butterfly needlepoint kit,"I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She has wanted to start doing needle work like her mom and I do and she loves butterflies, so this is the perfect gift for her. It has easy to follow directions and is small enough not to be overwhelming to a beginner but not so small as to be a disappointment as a finished project."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I purchased this product for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas. I thought it would be an excellent project to keep her occupied and focused. She was so excited to receive it. When we opened the box, there was NO YARN. I looked carefully to determine whether I was suppose to buy yarn. The box decription says that it comes with plenty of colorful yarn. It did not.All I got from this gift was a very disappointed 6 year old! I would not recommend that any parent/grandparent/aunt/uncle purchase this gift for fear of seeing the same sad look on your loved ones face!"
3,Horsey Mama,I loved the idea of doing this with my 3 and 5 year olds - but it does require you to change threads often and makes following the pattern difficult. Clearly labeled and colored but you will have to cut yarn as some of the stitches only have one or two stitches then you have to switch to another color. Not as impressed as Ithought I would be. We put it down for a while.
2,Quite frustrating toy,"I purchased it for my 6 year old. Since I have quite a bit of needlepoint experience, I thought it would be good introduction for my daughter. She got quite frustrated after 30 minutes (she is pretty patient child). She spent around 90% of time on changing yarn. Than she tried to go by color, but then the quality wasn't good (you could see other colors through the holes). Next day we tried regular needle and fabric and she did great. Neither I or my daughter would recommend this toy."
3,It looked nice,"I purchased this as a gift for a little girl for Christmas. It was a ""secret"" person gift, I don't know her identity."
2,Hard to do,"This is difficult to do and having to pay so much attention to how you loop takes the fun away. My 6 year old niece handed it to me and said, ""You do it. I don't understand."" I tried to get her started but the directions are poor. It is probably still sitting in the box unfinished."
4,Great Activity for Child Who Likes a Challenge,"My daughter wanted to do needlework after seeing some that I had done a few years ago. It is hard to find needlework kits made for younger children. This needlework kit by Alex is a great fit. My daughter is five and is enjoying the challenge of doing this project. This takes a LONG time. I have supervised her work for two hours and she likely has another hour or more of work. I would imagine that this project would take far less time with an older child.Also, since this takes a bit of coordination, the activity takes quite a bit of supervision to make sure the child doesn't get off track.Overall, I am very pleased with finding this kit. I think most children would become bored with the project, but for those like my daughter who like a challenge, this will be a perfect fit."
4,A wild ride,"An intricate storyline set mostly in Italy in the year 1954, in the midst of the cold war. Most characters are associated with the communists to one degree or another. With a mixture of true people and historical events, it gives the readers a strong sense of time and places. Friendship, love, crime, adventure, ideology, international intrigue, and politics all intertwined into a complex web.The first hundred pages are not easy read as various plotlines start almost disjointedly. Too many characters to follow without any hint of who are the important ones. But after that, pieces start to fall into places, and wow, what a ride to the very end."
4,A Great Album By A Little Known Band,"It's probable that you've never heard of this band, although I think they're better than most music on the radio today. Pilot Speed has a great sound with meaningful lyrics, not such a common combination in today's music world. It would be great if these guys were more well known; I definitely think they deserve it. It would also be great if their two original albums were available in the US.My favorite tracks are: I won't blame you, Alright, Ambulance, and Into the WestHope you give it a try!"
2,Left me a little empty.,With the title I should have not expected too much meat. I felt a lot of old myths and rumors were repeated here. The meal/food connected to a scandal idea was original although somewhat goulish. It was pretty light and tabloid-like but I shouldn't have been surprised--that is what the book was supposed to be. Wouldn't recommend it unless you just want a tiny taste of pure gossip that may have a bit of truth mixed in.
3,Cute and predictable,"I watched this movie only because I grew up in Yonkers, NY and yes, I am part Italian. It was cute and predictable but it sure ""took me back"" to what it was like to live in Yonkers and in a family with mulitple family run stores."
4,Good Italian fun,"I think this movie is perfect for people who live in Westchester because there are a lot of references to New York. I also watch a cerain part over and over again because I am an extra. So for me, the movie is great!"
2,Might work in ideal conditions,"I have been replacing these ""glued"" joints in my mountain cabin at they fail. They simply don't withstand cold temps. It may be fine for use in a temperate climate."
1,Not as good as they say,"Failed in 3 out of 4 joints done per specs. Instructions do not mention temperature vs. cure time. Suggest you don't use at less than 75 degrees F. If you do, wait extra long or warm up the joints."
3,For completists only,"The most marginal of all the Robotech books (and apparently the last), there's very little going on in this book, especially when judged in the time-frame of the overall Robotech story-line. If you wondered how Dana Sterling and company got off Earth between the fall of the Masters (end of book 9, or episode 60 of the TV show) and the arrival of the Invid, this book will tell you. Of course, if you read the books in numerical order, you'll have already gotten that info from Lisa Hunter's log entry at the end of ""Rubicon"", or from Dana's activities in ""End of the Circle"".It's to the authors' credit that they were able to keep finding stories in the undocumented time-lapses of the Robotech series and keep the whole universe consistent, but with ""Before the Invid Storm"", the diminishing returns may not be enough for some readers to bother with."
4,The struggle for power is over. NOT!,"The Robotech Masters have been defeated, but nobody can really say Earth won either. The United Earth Government and the Army of the Southern Cross are in ruins as both political and religious movements fight over the mecha and what is left of the planet. In outer space the Invid Sensor Nebula seems to suggest that the Invid has sensed the Flower of Life on Earth. In Japan the family of Shimada wait for the coming of the Invid who they plan to negotiate with while the rest of the planet prepares for a fight.Then Colonel Jonathan Wolf arrives with a heavily armed warship from space and things become even more complex!Once again we get to meet Dana Sterling, Louie Nichols, Misa Yoshida and, in the last few pages, the Invid themselves!"
2,"Fair-to-good story, bot barely any action","BtIS is one of those books that is meant for hard-core Robotech Junkies. It has a pretty good storyline, but the lack of action is a major hinderance. It provides more in-depth information that can be exacted from other scources, ut is over-all a good book if you know the story. THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR NEWBIES TO ROBOTECH TO READ! If you start out with this book you will not understand Robotech at all"
3,Not bad but too low action for ROBOTECH,I give this book 3 stars becase of its lack of action. It's nicely written and it is a good bridge between the 2nd and 3rd ROBOTECH wars. Although having Lynn-Minmei's name to actvate the Homeward Bound's Space Fold Drive was a little cheesey.
3,step back to the 1960s Ireland,"I have read some exerpts from Edna O'Brien's writings and was looking forward to reading this trilogy. I found all three books too wordy and the main characters too annoying to enjoy my reading, perhaps because I didn't relate to Ireland of the 1960s. The fact that the books were considered scandalous and were banned when published intrigued me but they just didn't hold my interest as anything more than period writing curiosity."
3,"Nice to look, bad to taste","My mouth taste like I just ate a bowl full of potpourri afterwards ... And yes, there was one time when I was a kid... But none the less potpourri... But I like the packaging and actually bought it for a display I am doing.. So..."
4,Making what one can of the end...,"While some of the reviews here have lambasted ""The Hundred Days"", after taking a step back and looking at it on its own rather than in the spot light pointed at his previous works in the series, I'd have to say that O'Brian did a more than passable job. Things that must be taken into consideration include the stage in development of both the characters and the story, as well as, of course, the immense build-up of expectations that met ""Hundred Days"" on its release from the yard. One must remember that POB's series is not comprised of massive line-of-battle ships, but consists of a sizable squadron of fast, nimble frigates of the sort before Americans got hold of the idea. Given that, in the proper context, POB has given us another lovely, though less lively, installment. Read it not becasue it's the best O'Brian has given us, but because it's much better than most of what those other than O'Brian have given us."
3,A Fainter Smell of Sea Air,"As a dyed-in-the-wool Aubrey/Maturin devot'e, and after devouring the first eighteen installments in this magnificent saga, I was quite disappointed in ""The Hundred Days.""Oh, the feel of the times still is present. The luscious taste of the language, of the wardroom, of the decks remains. But, something seems flat and stale in this book. I often had the impression that Mr. O'Brian was just ""getting through"" the thing and that little of his heart was in it.I was not happy with so much of the action taking place behind the scenes, as it were. I would have preferred to be present while it unfolded. I couldn't smell the salt air."
5,Shockingly good -- but a little short,"O'Brian represents the pinnacle of historical fiction authors, and this work, as shocking as it was to me, certainly maintains O'Brian's reputation. I could only wish that it were longer.Another reviewer mentioned that ""death"" was the central theme of this work, which it is, and as such, this is not the most cheerful (at all) in the series. Indeed, the deaths of two integral characters is handled in such a way as to maximize the reader's response to their deaths. This is not manipulation; this is a master writer at something very near the top of his game.Highly recommended, but someone new to Aubrey/Maturin would benefit from his earlier works before tackling this one."
3,Sometimes even the best strike out,"I eagerly awaited this latest of a great series and must confess to a slight disappointment. It reads as if O'brian has lost interest in the series, but has a dragon (and a mortgage payment) by the tail.Aubrey and Maturin also seem tired of the whole thing. Ironically, they are so much alive from previous novels, that even in this series dotage they seem like real people. Actors who have been in a TV series too long.Nevertheless, even this worst of the Aubrey/Maturin series is still head and shoulders above anything else in this genre.Jerry Schroeder Seattle, WA"
3,Is that all there is?,"I don't have problems with authors killing characters (being an author, I've done in a few of my own!). But I believe that Diane's death was handled very poorly. And why was it necessary? One of the pleasures of the books is the fact that while they are filled with macho action, the author still provides us with some interesting female characters. Diane was a truly great character, a strong woman and also believable. I read the books for the naval action, the relationship between Stephen and Jack, and Diane. At the very least, we might have witnessed her death, experienced her final moments, had a chance to grieve for her. And I want to know how Sophie felt about losing her mother! How did Jack feel about any of it?This book had its moments. I just wish there could have been more of them."
2,Pretty dissapointing book in a GREAT series,"I've loved these books, reread the first 18 multiple times. This 19th book seems perfunctory, and ill-at-ease with itself.It feels very distanced to me, not immediate, not compelling as the other have been. The pacing is lumpy. The level of detail is much lower than O'Brian generally uses. Overall, it just doesn't feel like he's in control of it this time."
3,Running out of steam,"The Hundred Days was quite disappointing, as if O'Brian is now runnng on automatic pilot. Maturin is still an innocent landlubber. The battle scenes and the sailing descriptions are as good as ever, but reruns. But like those scenes, much of the rest of the book is a rehash with no more dimension added to the characters. Indeed, O'Brian seems to have abandoned their shore-side existences."
1,O'Brian could never have written this drivel!,"""Disappointment"" is far too inadequate to describe my feelings after reading the first third of this book. There is none of the flash and sparkle that made O'Brian's prose so unique, none of the deep foreshadowing that haunts the reader's subconscious, none of the splendid sketches of personality of the main or supporting players which allowed nuances to ripen into full-blown behaviors. It is stilted, clumsy, boring, and, worst of all, a parody of the true O'Brian style.I could not bear to finish it; I have re-read the entire series at least three times, yet if I were to accept ""The Hundred Days"" as the ultimate chapter, I might never pick up any of the other volumes again. Do not read this book! Let Jack and Steven set off on their oceanographic expedition aboard the Surprise; let yourself forever speculate about the rest of their lives. Do not let them sail into this mess!"
2,Scrub,"About a third of the way through I thought, ""O'Brian has died and they're having someone ghost-write this!"" Stephen and Jack are mere caricatures. The bright, witty dialogue is missing and I just felt that some one had 'played me the flat' and that person was an awful scrub."
1,Beware of Narrator,"The item description says that it is read by Robert Hardy. The version I purchased was narrated by Simon Vance, the least desirable of the O'Brian narrators. Seller blames Amazon."
4,Classic O'Brian,"Like the reviewer who praised the author of the recently released historical fiction novel, ""The Triumph and the Glory"" as the heir apparent to Patrick O'Brian, I found Triumph very similar in flavor and wit to O'Brian's magnificent Aubrey/Maturin series. Read every one of his novels, they are lively, vastly entertaining journeys back in time to the days of sail. The Hundred Days is excellent, not perhaps as good as some of his earlier novels in the series, but still very worthwhile reading."
1,NOT UP TO PAR,This book does not meet the standards set by the rest of the series. It appears to have been rushed to the point that we lose the character interface that makes the other books so good. Hopefully the next book will go back to the pattern he established with all the others.
3,"Vintage Aubrey & Maturin, but disappointing","I love this series. However, this latest book is very heavily steeped in the loves of the main characters and has few of the facets that I feel leaven the detail. Most of the book is filled with details about sailing and naturalism. Very little space is given to the personal trials and triumphs that kept me following the evolution of Aubrey and Maturin. There is even relatively little in the way of rousing battle scenes. I continue to enjoy the series, but this last one left me rather cool."
2,Not as exciting as its predecessors.,"As a true O'Brian fan who devoured the first 18 books in this series, I can tell you #19 was a disappointment. I was bored most of the time and couldn't get involved in the story at all. O'Brian's writing seemed perfunctory at best, and the cavalier way in which he did away with both Diana Villiers and Barrett Bonden shocked me. I'm not giving away any major plot twists here, because there weren't any -- they just died. I'm disappointed in Mr. O'Brian but will read #20, hoping he will return to true form. If not, maybe he should quit while he's still sort of ahead, so those of us who love the series will reread it fondly and treasure it forever without it being tarnished."
2,Angioplasty,"For the devoted series fan, The Hundred Days is like angioplasty. You have to have it done, but it's certainly not enjoyable."
1,Save a tree - avoid reading this book!,"What a waste of time! After having read a number of novels from the series, I was quite excited to see this one. Unfortunately, my excitement was premature. The whole book is shallow and not captivating at all. Sorry that the ultimate novel in a great series had to be like this."
2,THe Hundred Days,"Jack and the rest of his squadron must intercept a shipment of gold sent to the Muslim mercenaries from Napoleon in order for them to join him in war. Jack must first sail through the Adriatic ports and sink and destroy any one who plans to join Napoleon.I personally did not like the book. The book moved to slowly, and was about something that I'm not really interested in. However, people who are interested in war stories and sailors would enjoy this book. Someone who is excited by Napoleon might also like the book. With a little more action and a faster pace, this would be a great novel. In the book The Hundred Days by Patrick O'Brian the main character is Jack Aubrey."
1,No Hornblower,I have read all the volumes of Hornblower last year and decided to give O'brien a try. I don't know if all his books are like this but this is a joke compared to Forrester.
4,"Hap Palmer's ""Getting to Know Myself""","Hap Palmer lends his gentle voice and melodies to a fabulous collection of songs here. They incorporate enough movement to maintain interest, but at intervals that will not cause things to detiorate into bedlam. I've used this collection with a class of 35 3 to 6 year olds at a Montessori school--it was our ""morning warm-up."" We especially liked ""Turn-a-round."" This collection enhances listening skills."
5,Classic,Listened to this when I was little kid. Bought this for my nephews. Just as great as I remember. A must have for any kid
5,Fun!,This cd is so much fun! My one and three- year-olds love to dance to the music. It also helps to teach them to follow directions.
3,Very useful,"This book is excellent; I use it and other Stellino books about everyday. However, many of the recipes need to be simplified-way too many unneccessary ingredients. If you know what you can do without you're all set."
5,He's the BEST!,"Nick Stellino's television shows and cookbooks are wonderful. His recipes don't call for any exotic ingredients and the instructions are not complicated in any way. I had the opportunity to see him in person doing a cooking demonstration and he is as entertaining in person as he is on TV. And he ended the demo saying ""from my heart to your kitchen, arriva derci!"" You've got to love him!"
5,10 Stars,"Well done Nick. Kudos.I've tried many of Nick's recipes from this book (and from his website), and with just a very few exceptions, every out came out spectacularly.All the recipes are well written and easy to follow. Even as an experienced cook, I still gain new insights from the many ""Cook's Tips"" through out the book. He keeps the personal asides to a minimum and short. This is a cookbook after all and not a biography.And the ""used"" prices are unbelievable. From some sellers only $0.01 plus $4 shipping!I can (and do) recommend this book."
2,Cats Claw,I purchased this product because I was looking for a natrual treatment for digestive issues.Saw a piece on TV that this product was beneficial for treatment of Crohn's disease and IBD both of which run in the family.Have been taking for a few weeks. So far there hasn't been any relief. I admit that I usually forget to take all 3 doses per day.The product has has not worked for me. I am not really surprised becaus to date I haven't found anything that helps.
4,"good quality, fast service hate these reviews with a passion","good quality, fast service hate these reviews with a passiongood quality, fast service hate these reviews with a passion"
5,Sensitive to mounting,"I bought my wife a Brunton Rally for her Jeep Wrangler. Originally, I mounted it in the center of the dashboard and she mentioned that it indicated NW intermittently - even times she knew she was driving straight South. When the compass was moved away from that location, it read accurately. Apparently, a magnet in the stereo was throwing it off.I moved it to a position straight in front of the instrument pod and have not had a problem since. It has a great classic look in a 4X4 and it has never let us down.Check your mounting location first for stereo, speaker or motor magnets."
1,Defective compass,"I bought one of these compasses for my car. It is completelyinaccurate --- so much so that if I'm heading east it saysI'm going south! You are supposed to be able to connect thecompass to a power source so that it's illuminated, but theinstructions contain no mention of how to do that. In sum,buying this ""compass"" is like flushing money down the toilet."
5,Not just for the car!,"It calms me down too, but not to the point of being sleepy. It's a great CD! I highly recommend it!"
3,Small,The pendant is very small but is still cute. My wife's big complaint is that it was pictured with a chain and did not come with one. In the listing I see that but I'm only conveying the message.
3,'Document 01-Trance/Tribal'- various artists(Fifth Column),"'Document 01' is a collection of twelve very diverse sounding bands that I've never heard of doing twelve different songs.I believe most of the music here is called trance,or maybe tribal.Either way,it sort of grows on me.Many of these tunes are similar to the music they play in those inner-city late night clubs.The cuts that I sort of felt drew me in are Hanging Garden's ""Red Garden"" which is quite experimental sounding,Garry Havrillay's ""The Killing Jar"" and Suntoy playing their namesake ""Suntoy"".Another cut well worth mentioning is Shinjuku Filth with their contribution of ""Afraid Of The Aesthetic"" that,to me sounds like clasiic '70's space rock.Right on!!"
4,Great introduction to the Dorobo label...,"The Dorobo label (and its subsidiary, Iridium) out of Australia was one of the best labels of the late 90s, early 00s. Mostly stemming from classically trained artists with an art school aesthetic, the label featured artists who were experimenting with industrial/electronica sounding music.The label is now defunct as the founders have moved on to other pursuits, though Darrin Verhagen's website has most of the back catalogue available for purchase.Ignore the ""trance"" and ""tribal"" tags and all that has come to mean. Most of the artists here have a catalogue of works under these and other monikers and all of them are well worth pursuing. Once you start digging in, you'll want to go deeper.Highly recommended."
1,COPS turned bounty hunters,"I knew Carradine was having trouble getting parts, but after watching this mess I think he really needs to give it up. The only future thing in this movie is a robotic glove that is a lot more trouble than it's worth, Carradine puts it on a few times throughout the movie to shot a lazar at the bad guys, oh so thrilling, snore...The funniest thing was the emblem he wore on his jacket from his kung fu series, the man is living in a dream world if he thinks fans of that show will over look the crappy acting, fighting, script, and story line he needs help.Final note; this is one of two movies he made, (Future Zone and Future Force) both are basically the same movie and he plays the same character. Run away from this film as fast as you can..."
5,In memory of Arlene Dever,I had the pleasure of meeting Fordyce Detamore back in the 1970's and also knowing personally Arlene Dever. They have both passed away now but I know they are in heaven and awaiting Christ's return. Great book and an eternal message!!
1,Doesn't block drains at all.,"I've recently purchased this drain stopper at a local supermarket because my new dorm room doesn't have a drain plug. I'll admit, I was really expecting this product to do an excellent job, because I've seen other drain stoppers that would suddenly stop a whirlpool from forming, but here's the difference, the good ones I've seen in the past were made of RUBBER; this one is simply a thick, inflexible plastic cover that doesn't do its job. I tested this in my bathtub and instead of actually blocking out water, it was seeping some of the water in because the stopper wasn't fully sealing out the water. So, each time I have to use this, I have to keep putting my foot onto the ""lid"" so it'll stop draining. Don't get this, it's a waste of money."
1,Fire Hazard,"MiniMax Tower FanI bought this fan for my desk 2 months ago, it was not being used 24/7 or being left on for overly long periods of time however the controls seem to have burnt out. I noticed early on the LED's flickered a bit at start up but it corrected itself quickly but now there are no LED's and no settings buttons work even the power button doesn't respond and their is an odd smell to it now. It ""died"" in an ""On High"" state so we can plug it in to use it but you have to unplug it to stop it and frankly we worry about a house fire so we removed it.I strongly fear for the safty of anyone who has one in their home, and would suggest the retail price should be more in the $10 range at best for this sort of cheap craftsmanship."
4,Very good,"It's a real loss that this book is not on print anymore. Deere, altough being superficial when to comes to characters descriptions (a common feature in WW II biographical fighter pilots books) has a very nice writing style. This book was first published in 1959."
2,Surprisingly boring,"I remember reading my father's copy of this book and any years later managed to get my own copy. And boy, is it boring. Deere may have been a great fighter pilot but he can't write to save his life and should really have found a ghost writer. The combat scenes are relatively far and few between and he inserts vast chunks of dead dialogue. I have two problems with this. Firstly, it's exceedingly boring, and secondly, I can't believe for one second that 12 years after the events he has such perfect recall of every small and insignificant remark that everyone around him made. If you want excitement, read The Big Show by Pierre Clostermann, which is perhaps the best autobiography by any World War Two fighter pilot."
4,decent enough for a compass,"I must admit I like it. The compass is very precise and the brass case feels nicer to hold than a plastic case. Outside of that, the compass does and feels like it should. I would, however, recommend a cheaper plastic cased compass for those who don't use a compass that often. Enough said."
2,Poor quality construction,"The first time I used it the little magnifying lens in the eyepiece popped out without even touching it! Luckily I found it and managed to superglue it back into place. Also, the compass seems very slow to respond to positional changes, as if over dampened or under magnetized. Although it feels very sturdy with the nice metal case, I have a plastic compass that works better. This is more of a showpiece than something I would want to be relying on when lost in the woods."
5,"Compact, Good Looking Compass","Product arrived on time, as advertised. It is good looking and just exactly what my husband wanted."
5,classic horror in the time when horror was the rage.,"People give this movie a hard time because the special effects dont compete with the ones of today. The fact is though, is that this movies plot was original. It was not just another vampire, werewolf, slasher, etc. movie. It brought something new all together to the world of horror. As for the sequels, there a different story."
3,Cheese corny fun,"Ah, early 80s horror films...so cheesy. So corny. So much fun. And it is a blast to hear John Franklin scream like a little girl when they hoist him up on the cross in the clearing.I wish there had been a bit more explanation of what the supernatural force is and how these kids came to be overtaken by this nutty young preacher."
4,"""He Who Walks Behind The Rows""",Classic film by a classic writer. It started with Carrie then it went from there. I dont think there is one bad movie that King has ever did.Made in 84' Its a story about a town that is overun by a group of cult children. They kill off there parents and act crazy all round. The kids meet up in the middle of a cornfield and they all bow down to this figure they call the blue man. Isaac is the leader of the cult group. If you join there group there is no leaving. If you try and leave they kill you.This is a real scary tail. King will take you to hell and back with this movie. If you like Kings other work I think that you should give this movie a try. Pick it up at amazon.
5,Children of the Corn,"A boy preacher named Isaac goes to a town in Nebraska called Gatlin and gets all the children to murder every adult in town. A young couple have a murder to report and they go to the nearest town (Gatlin) to seek help but the town seems deserted. They are soon trapped in Gatlin with little chance of getting out alive. The movie is very good. The isolation of the town, and the chillling child chorus music score is brilliant. A little strange, but, then again, this is a Stephen King movie."

1,What????,"How can a horrible movie like this (and I saw it as a young horror fanatic) make it to blu-ray, and a classic like The Howling or (more importantly) The Exorcist not be out on blu-ray? We saw this as kids and made fun of it... it's so bad! Bad script, dialogue, pacing of scenes, effects... you name it.""Cujo"" was a better low budget attempt. ""Stand By Me"" blows them all out of the water as a King cinematic adaptation from the same time period. I will say, it's probably not as irritating as the adaptation of ""Lawnmower Man"" from the same book of short stories, ""Night Shift"" (not to be confused with the Michael Keaton Henry Winkler Shelly Long comedy)."
1,Blu-Ray Review,The Audio is better than the Video in this stupid and dumb movie. I'm glad I will be returning it.
1,Not bad,Back in the day I watched a movie called Children of the Corn. Well at less that's what I thought it was called. It starts with a small town. Everyone is put on a spell and fell asleep. After everyone wakes up all of the woman are pregnant. Everyone gives birth to children who want to kill the town. Only one little boy doesn't want to kill the town. He try's to stop the others.I thought this movie was the same as I described. I am very disapointed that it is the wrong movie. I really really want the other Children of the Corn movie. There are way too many Children of the Corn for me to find the one I am looking for. If any one reads this and knows what movie I am talking about message me. I hope there is a way to message me. Well since I was so unhappy with this movie I didn't really give it a chances. I am in the middle of watching it now. And I guess this movie isn't bad.
5,"OUTLANDER,this is slashing horror","When I saw this movie I was blown away.It was sad that ALL the adults died,but the weirdest thing is that the signs to gatlin are every where they confuse a couple that are lost on a trip across the country when they stumble onto these children that hail to a demon in the corn when the kids get to old they are sorry,can't tellyou have to see the movie."
5,One of the greatest horror films of all time!,"Among my top ten horror films, Children of the Corn succeeds on all levels.Acting, cinematography, music, and direction are all first rate.The concept of children chasing adults with scythes and other pointy objects is just terrifying to me. This film is a classic and nothing short of terrific.The DVD comes with a trailer and booklet.Contrary to what you may have heard, it really is a great series of horror films.I highly recommend checking out the 6 sequels. Most all of them are genuinely frightening."
2,Cheeze-Corn...,"I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star..."
4,I'm so wild about Isaac,"AND HE'S SO WILD ABOUT ME! This is a good Stephen King movie. The beginning of it is very violent!! The whole movie is also strange, which is cool! If I was to pick any of my favorite Steven King classics, this would be one of them. It is about 2 people who are driving through Nebraska and they come across an apparently dead kid in the road. Everyone else there worships a cornfield and has weird rituals and stuff. They must enjoy killing people because it is part of their mumbo-jumbo religion which is one that you don't see everyday. The ending is also very violent and it has a good plot. I think the end is one of it's best parts! The cornfield death is just a little gory too. This movie is definetely recommended if you like Stephen King's stuff. Peace out."
2,kind of a bore...,"yea yea yea its a cult classic and very memorable...but why...stephen king is an amazing writer, but this is weak...its not very suspensful, not very well acted, the score tho is probably the best ive ever heard from a horror movie, but the story line is slow and at times very boring. And a lot of the characters are really annoying i mean, they make you want to take a gun to your TV annoying! Isaac, i wanted to slaughter that high pitched, midget friend of Dorothy, always complaining and going on! and malachae or w/e his name is...the dood with the red mullet and horse jaw....he annoyed me more than isaac...and whats with the stupid ending? the visual looks sooooo bad and soooo stupid! this movie as a whole just makes me mad....ok im changing the rating from a 3 to a 2. Only reasons its getting 2 stars is cuz the music is awesome and its by stephen king....other than that...its not worth it"
1,This is horror?,"I recently read a review by hucklecat03 on this movie. I have to say it made me laugh when he says that ""you'll be more entertained by eating corn that watching Children of the Corn"". It made me laugh because he is SO RIGHT. This movie is not scary and it's not good. As a fan of Stephen King I have to say I was extremely disappointed at this laughable attempt for a frightfest. I'm just wondering how a bunch of young punks can take over a whole town. I just thought the movie was stupid, plain and simple. don't waste your time, effort or money watching this movie. This movie is actually horror if you put the two words together that make the word horrible. It's HORROR BULL."
3,A Creepy Nugget From SK's Night Shift,"The strange thing about this whole movie and its trail of sequels that I have never had the inkling to watch is that it was just a itty bitty short story in Stephen King's Night Shift. (Look for the book on the dashboard of the car in front of Linda Hamilton in the opening scenes....) Not totally unfaithful to the story, it still misses around the corners most of the time. I saw this movie originally when I was like 13 years old and it was scary back then. Now...well, we're all grown up...so the horrors have become tarnished with age. But...it still gives a faint tremmor of the willies and that's pretty cool. Not a bad movie for the price...you could do a lot worse with such bile as 976-EVIL for instance. Overall...decent. Good watch when the lights go out.Dig it!"
2,Corny,"Children of the Corn is ninety excruciatingly long minutes of kids hacking up their parents and other adults who vex them. How about this, I'll sum up the movie with a few quotes.""He who walks behind the rows is displeased."" (ooooooh)""Outlander---I'll get you OUTLANDER!""""Who did this?""""Isaac.""""Malachai.""""Sacrifice, sacrifice!""It's really pretty awful, and the acting is worse. I'm not a fan of Stephen King, but I'm guessing his novella would have to be better than this. If you thought The Shining was bad, you're in for a special treat!That said, it does have some things going for it. The cover is scary looking. The VHS copy has a raised sickle (I've never liked those things) and evil eyes watching from the corn stalks. And there is something genuinely creepy about a corn field. I don't know what else to say. Don't see this movie!!!"
3,alright,"Note- this review talks about the brand new remade version of Children of the Corn that came out this year. I believe this is the version amazon is selling.The newer version of Children of the Corn can best be described like this-The film is divided into two parts-- the first 45 minutes of film which involves the man and his wife arguing and fighting while riding up and down the streets of Nebraska looking at corn and searching for any kind of human activity.- the second half of the movie which focuses on the husband running through cornfields trying to escape the children who are relentlessly after him.The ending is a pretty big disappoinment though because it ends on a note where you're left feeling like the writers didn't complete the story all the way.Besides that, stick with the original Children of the Corn. It's much better."
4,The Way Horror Movies are sopposed to be made,"This is a pretty good horror movie. It is how horror movies were made years ago. It is about a couple who travel to a town called Gatlin and meet some creepy kids who all follow a special diety. The children want to add the couple to their ""collection"", and give their souls to ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"". Thier is also no gore in the film, exept for the slaughter at the beginning at the coffee shop. A good film that spawned terrible sequals exept for the 3rd and COTC 666."
2,This movie is boring,"Married couple get lost on the road and end up in a town where the population is all kids who killed their parents and worship some god who protects their crops. While the mass murder scene in the diner at the beginning and the sacrifice at the end were both really cool, this movie is REALLY boring! Pizza."
1,The movie ok,"I liked the movie and the fact that it doesn't have a lot of gore in it, but still a suspensful horror. I really thought the plot was great but as a stephen king freak, I would have to say that I would only place it in the middle between the good and bad movies of king."
1,Is this even a movie?,"What a dreadful, horrible, and boring insult to every movie ever made. It is so laughably tacky that it shouldn't of even been made. Steer as far away from this as possible!"
2,"Save your time, and read the short story!","I admit when I was six years old, this movie was a little creepy and made me think twice before passing a cornfield. Now, I look at it and wonder how I even made it past the second scene without falling asleep. The only tense scene in this movie is when Joseph is running through the cornfield. Other then that, it's a movie to watch when you're bored and having nothing better to do. It's not scary, and Isaac's ranting and raving can get on your nerves after awhile. If you want good horror, then read the short story by Stephen King."
3,Back to the '80s,"Before watching this movie, remember you are going to see an adaptation from a few-pages-long story by Stephen King, performed during the late eighties, when horror movies were the main attraction to young teenagers.The movie is ridiculous, even if the story is pretty interesting. There are few moments of suspance, but actors aren't really there. It's a kind of a B-movie, with a solid background and incredibly low quality effects.Anyway, it's interesting to see and to have, as the sign of a very different age.The DVD is quite well mastered. Images are very noisy because of film grain, but otherwise consistent. Contrast is quite low, and this makes colours a bit washed out.The sound is a multichannel remix from Chase, encoded in DD 5.1. Anyway dialogues are quite dated and so are the effects. Basses are too boomy and the soundfield collapses too often into the center channel.The extras are very limited: there's a small booklet and a trailer. That's it."
4,Corny But Fun.,"Children of the Corn, I shall freely admit, will not win any oscars.But like all Grade-B films, it is not meant to. It is designed for people who like to sit back, munch on chicken wings, and enjoy themselves.With that in mind, I openly admit liking the movie. Yes, its missing footage should be added back in, and yes, its ""climatic"" confrontation scene involves one of the most corniest (get it, corniest? Corny? Children of the Corn? I gotta million of 'em!) speeches imaginable, but who cares.It's fun!!!"
1,Too violent,I did not finish this movie. Too much spattered blood.I thought it would be more creepy than violent. Recent news makes children and violence less tolerable than it used to be.
3,"Not a masterpiece, but....","As a huge fan of Stephen King, I love anything I can read, listen to or watch, with only a few exceptions. If he won't put his name on something, I'll skip it. It's research I don't mind doing. Every sequel to this movie is in that category."
2,Horrible Adaption,The acting was terrible! There were so many holes in the plot. The character development in the short story was completely missing from the movie. I didn't care about the characters in the movie. There was zero suspense or scares like in the short story. This is just another example of Hollywood changing a story when it was good as it was.
2,This movie is horrible,"I just got threw watching this movie. It was boring from begining to end. There wasen't awhole lot of good scene's in this movie, the only decent scene was at the begining..."
3,OUTLANDER!,"Malachai is the frightening one here in this adaptation of Stephen Kings short story Children of the Corn.This movie will give you the creeps during the scenes through the corn fields, the fact that the town has been rid of adults, and then there is the scene--an unexpected scene that involves a child and a car ...enough said. Watch the movie and feel the fright for yourself.There are some cheesy parts in this movie due to low budget production, but all in all not so bad.Stephen John BecciaAuthor of the Treelanders--Journey to the Giants"
4,He Who Watches This Will Smile,"Don't be discouraged by bad reviews of this movie adapted from an original story by Stephen King in NightShift.In fact, grab some popcorn and watch this wonderful gem of a movie.Children of the Corn will grab you from the beginning with an easy going sense of small town story. I was easily caught up in the two adult characters and their journey into this Nebraska town.Small surprises, funny lines, and interesting (yet oddly strange) villains create a memorable movie. It's not a movie to analyze, just a fun horror flick without much gratuitous nudity or language--refreshing these days."
2,Maybe the most over-rated book of recent times.,"It's perhaps due to my limited knowledge of mythology, or maybe just bad timing, but this was a waste. Read in '92, I still wonder what I'm missing, given all the hype back then. Banters on and on, and probably written while in herringbone. Couldn't help but feel that taken by his own heightened self-importance. Premise is sterling. To me though, the execution was brutally boring and tautologous. I'm certain that we're all better-off reading the classics themselves"
5,FULL OF INSIGHTS,"The book is full of insights in a great simbolic language, which enrich the meaning and possibilities by the images used.I strongly recommend it."
2,OK if read from the point of a passive observer,"I really enjoyed his analysis of the story, and the practical applications he made. Unfortunately, this gets drowned in long winded Joseph Campbellesque tangents (very long winded and tiring at times-like the several pages on hair...ok! we get it!). I used these sections to practice my speed reading.If he would have dwelled more upon the story in question and the direct application, making brief mention of mythological links when really needed, it would have been a much more powerful book.All such soul-searching books should, in my opinion, be read with a grain of salt (hence, the title of this review). A point that may be truly inspiring for one person could be stunting for another. If you want to read it, read it passively and then take away any points that inspire you-otherwise, realize that no poet, historian, mythologist, etc., is the master of your soul."
3,Iron John as reviewed by one who knows his Father,"The original story was not by the Brothers Grimm, but is a story for young boys that is taught them by their present and interactive Fathers, Real men, not those existing on a social crutch of alcoholism or drug dependency in the degenerative state of conciousness known as America.The sory is not an attack on women, nor meant for young boys to emulate women, but rather to know that deep inside of yourself as an individual male you have your own identity and that no matter what you do in life, you as the individual are what is important in the final analysis, as taught to me in my native Germany, by my Father."
4,"The Hairy Man, set free","my brother gave me this book in the mid ninties, 10 to 12 years ago. i've just rediscovered it. this time hearing what is talked about with an open heart. i wasn't too open before. With a center, such as Jesus, i wholeheartedly recommend the concepts discussed."
4,One good book!,"The book was recommended to me by a mentor. It's a great book that takes apart an old tale and retranslates it for the reader to unlock some essential elements necessary for a young mans step into manhood. Every young man should read this book. Bly keeps the reader engaged and writes in a matter that any man at any point in their lives can gleam new understanding into themselves and in turn use to become better sons, fathers, husbands,and men."
2,The Rag and Bone Shop of the Intellectually Heartless,"Instead of writing my review of Mr. Bly's seminal work in the linear language of prose, I'd like instead to present an epigram-review, in honor of our ancestors, a Jungian epigram-review, in the Jungian vein.On Looking At Bly's ""Iron John"": A Confession of SortsThanks to Mr. BlyI now own a small brown cardboard boxFull of little white plastic picnic forks-May 8, 2001"
2,"In the end, it's just another fairy tale","This book looked good, perhaps insightful, maybe even fascinating... until I got to the point where the guy started quoting Bruno Bettlehiem. While most people aren't going to be familiar with the name, Bettlehiem was an expert on folklore and mythology who tried to pass himself off as a reputable psychologist. He ruined the lives of millions of people by stating unequivocally, with nothing but a hunch and his collection of fairy-tails to back him up, that autism (a neurobiological condition present in-utero) was actually the result of bad mothering.It was then that I realized that maybe fairy tails, such as the fairy-tale of Iron John, can tell us something... but we shouldn't assume that just because something is old that it's Timeless Wisdom. This is especially true as the fairy tales and myths explored in this book are all the products of patriarchal cultures. Ultimately, although this book is ""food for thought,"" I wouldn't consider it a complete meal."
1,A thinking man's chauvenism,"Bly's masturbatory rambling in Iron John is an utter waste of a reader's time. He makes some quasi-valid points about problems with male roles in society, but just when he approaches a solution, he slips into cryptic metaphor that is neither interesting nor useful. And, when glancing at the book's jacket, I wondered what qualifications a man who dresses like a Renaissance-era jester has to tell me how to be a man."
1,Boring,"This book is the victim of a stuffy psycho-babbling author, and gives no real credit to men in general and even less to woman. And it goes on about bizarre analogies that make no sense to me."
5,Love this old book!,"Love this book which has been around for quite some time. It changed my thinking about men, masculinity and many things male."
3,"Great, and here's how.","I just read this book and didn't over-analyze it but did stick with it. Without really understanding how, it moved me a million times in a million ways. But it is too fruity. And it really strongly assumes that every father is good and just being bashed. Many are. This is true for our times. But he does not even allow for the possibility that a father actually is a crappy father who competes with his son in a bad way."
2,Book is an amalgamation of references and makes no point,"Most frustratingly, Bly really has nothing to recommend, that's the sad part. I think we all know how important a good Dad is, and hopefully that's all what Bob wanted to say... although he never stated it (i guess no one would buy a book with one sentence inside)"
2,"Oh Myth, can you explain this to me?","Robert Bly is a quirky poet whose work I have always enjoyed both for its personal vision and for its unflenching honesty. But this - Iron John: A Book About Men - has me totally puzzled. I read it. I don't get it. I really see no connection with what is dealt with in this book and my life as a 'man'. Certainly not in any way that is useful. If I worked really hard, maybe I could see some suggestions of something that would be personally meaningful, but nothing about the book prompts me to work that hard. A friend joked that this was 'Lord of the Flies for Adult Guys,' but I think even that is more cogent than the suggestive message of the book.I will continue to read Bly's poetry, but won't waste my time on any more of this male soul searching stuff."
4,"Style aside, a great primer on mens' issues","I was put off at first. The recent edition still carries the tone of the ('90) original, which feels to me like a reaction to the perceived male-bashing of that time. It's also written in a somewhat academic -- but still entertaining -- style.Those issues aside, all the meat is still there. I found it a great exploration of what today's men face, how male initiation has been neglected in Western society, and the costs of that neglect. Stick with it, and take it as a very good intro to these important topics."
4,Lyrical and resonant....,"I'd thought from the opening pages that this was going to be another trite and superficial book - after all, what would a poet, however existential, know about the holes of the soul. But soon after, the book became fascinating, even difficult to put down. There's certainly a strong strand of personal experience and prisms that color the narrative, but having said that it doesn't take anything away.Definitely a book that can safely be called lyrical. A simple yet powerful writing style makes for a book that plays with your imagination."
5,great book,"This is a great book about modern society and men. Even through it was written nearly 20 years ago, it is still completely applicable, if not more so. Written in a textual analysis of an ancient story, the author weaves current observations about our society into a discussion of how human societies evolved over thousands of years. This is a great book if you have a young boy, or work with a Boy Scout Troop or school."
3,Mixed emotions on myth analysis,"I did not expect that this would be such deep myth analysis. Hardly any literature here, mostly deep myth analysis that make Joseph Campbell seem predestrian. In the end, I have mixed emotions, don't know how I feel, just felt that this was almost a text book meant for discussion in an academic session"
4,Filled With Metaphor and Meaning,"This book came out when men's groups were everywhere. The myths and metaphors in this book are very powerful but you don't have to be a seasoned member of a men's group to understand it. You do, however, need to possess a working knowledge of psychology in order to grasp the meaning. If you are a man who comes from a seriously dysfunctional family, you will benefit greatly from this book. It explores the emotional geography of being a man and dealing with the complex feelings that come from even the slightest abuses. It is a bit heavy on myth, though. I had Louise Hay to guide me...I wish there were a male equivalent of her for men."
1,Huh?,"I may be the elephant in the room here, but quite frankly I found this book to be a crashing bore. Out of the thousands of books that I have read in my lifetime I can count on one hand those that I have not finished and this is one of them. I get the point that the author is trying to make and heartily agree with the plight of men and what our society has done to the concept of ""manhood"" but trying to get through this piece of literature was like being stuck in cement and waiting to be rescued."
2,Pious Vision of Academia Elite,"I winced several times at the author's casual leftist remarks in the preface, but when he called Ronald ""Reagan a sort of mummified version of a dogged type... underneath the charm and bluff there remains much isolation, deprivation, and passivity. Unless he has an enemy, he isn't sure he is alive,"" Bly began to lose me. This incongruent insertion is on page one and things go downhill from there. Bly starts in that smug, elitist place Thomas Sowell writes about in his ""annointed vision"" books. Maybe something can be learned from this offensive little compilation, however, I remain censorious."
3,required reading...,had to read this book for my college class. not a bad book if you're a guy and you're lost in life. problem is I was supposed to read it on such a short schedule that I got bored really fast and didn't finish it. and it's not worth finishing to me. but it was well written and if i had more free time perhaps i'd finish it.
2,SS study,This is a book that many in our class really like. I find it somewhat difficult. It does not present the study in a way that is easy for me to use when leading the class.
5,A must have for any relaxation DVD library.,"I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys peaceful relaxing music mixed with breathtaking scenery. This DVD offers the viewer different sections each one filled with visually stimulating scenes. The quality of filming in this production is far superior to any other relaxation/meditation DVD that I have watched. The sound quality is also excellent, when played on a good sound system you will feel transported into the scenes. It's impossible to feel anything but positive while watching this DVD, so sit back, relax and enjoy."
3,"Not Yoknapatawpha, not for me","This was not a bad not a bad book. I had to say that initially. For some other authors, this book could have been their masterpiece. The problem though, is that this is a Faulkner book. Faulkner reinvented the use of the English language in all the Yoknapatawpha books. The problem is that when you compare something as compicated as a Yoknapatawpha novel to anything else, it has to fall short. The plots of other Faulkner books are so dense and full of sybolism. Mosquitoes is not dense. It has a very mundane story about people on a boat. This, like other Faulkner novels revolves around the nature of human beings and their interactions. This novel is a more dialectical one in comparison to some of he other novels of his. We do not have the dark humor here that there is in a novel such as AsI Lay.... The epilogue redeems the novel with some of the dense writingthat Faulkner is notorious for. Read this after you read several other Faulkner novels."
4,Excellent overview and introduction to Aquinas.,I found the book to be well written and readable. Covering the major ideas of Aquinas while pointing out what was left out as well as contrasting his ideas with other philosophers. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about Aquinas' ideas.
4,"The ""veritate"", according to Aquinas","This was not a trivial book, a real tour the force trying to sync with Aquinas thought and understand part of the Christian, more specifically Catholic, theology and dogmas. The philosophy of this dominican priest of the thirteen century is based in plain reasoning, focusing in great deal on the ""questions of language"". His four reasons for the existance of God, his reflections about evil, sin and soul were the most interesting to know in my case, although he has opinion on several other issues, like politics and society. All this search for knowlegde is developed on a medieval society, and it is important to be aware of that context in order to appreciate Aquinas thought, as historical or of metaphysical relevance."
3,was decent but....,I liked this tv for a while...but then the picture stopped working (sound still works). I would assume a tv should last longer than 4 years under normal wear and tear.
5,THIS BAND ARE A NATIONAL TREASURE !,"If you don't own a HMHB album, you should.Since the mid-eighties these lads from the Wirral have made the funniest,most well observed and offensive music you could ever wish to hear. Who can forget tracks like ""Dickie Davies Eyes"" and ""Vatican Broadside"" ?This album offers more of the same in terms of wit and the knack of saying just what you were thinking.Standout tracks for me are, ""Referee's Alphabet"" "" The Light At The End Of The Tunnel"" and the brilliant ""San Antonio Foam Party"".Do yourself a favour and buy this album, you won't regret it."
5,Great songs that really young ones can relate to.,"Both my son and I love this CD. My son is 17 months old now and loves dancing to the music. I love the fact that, when I get the songs stuck in my head, I don't go crazy. The topics are appropriate for little ones. The songs are about things they can relate to, such as sitting in a highchair, playing horsey with daddy, not wanting a comfort item washed, and potty training. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Appropriate Themes for Infants & Toddlers,"The themes of Hap Palmer's upbeat songs on this CD are appropriate for the under three. Themes such as those found in ""My Mommy Comes Back"" are real concerns of the child of this age. Another example is ""Sittin' in a High Chair"" which playfully recognizing the impatience of the infant-toddler waiting in his or her high chair for the food to arrive. Palmer addresses these concerns with warmth and singable tunes."
5,Best Mouse Ever!!!,"After getting and using this mouse, i can't imagine going back to a regular mouse. The mouse has a sleek, finished look that is sure to fit into almost any decor. it has a small button on the side that will bring you pack a page in a web browser. it has at to center a stylish black scroll wheel and on ether side of that, left and right mouse buttons. Below the scroll wheal there is a small plus and minus button that controls the 3 mouse speeds. This mouse it the perfect gift for anyone with a computer. Highly Recommended!!!!"
4,Almost the perfect mouse.,"Pros: the mouse looks great. The grip is exceptional. While the weights are not that functional, they are pretty cool. And just about everything else is great.Cons: the only real bummer about this mouse is that the scroll wheel is choppy. It does not have the smooth scroll with the quick buzz sound you would expect. Instead it is choppy and makes a deep ""grut.grut.grut"" sound.Other than that i have no complaints"
2,Great Mouse if it stays working (Resets itself),"This was a great mouse for about 3 months until erratic behavior. Either playing games or daily activities, my G5 has resorted to freezing and resetting itself every 30 mins or so. Logitech support is very lacking and they can only tell you to update the firmware and setpoint software. By the way, neither has cured the problem."
1,Two defective mice in a row,"I got the G5 to enhance my game playing with a variety of games. Unfortunately the first time I got the G5 it would not work. It installed fine and the XP system recognized its existence (Device manager OK, etc) but the system would not recognize cursor movements nor button actions. I traded it in for a replacement and it worked for an entire two weeks and then it stopped working the same way. I would not recommend this mouse to any one, although based on the other reviews not every one has had the same disasterous problems I have had. My other mice work fine although not with the crisp action I enjoyed with my second G5 for the first two weeks. Buyer beware!"
4,Logitech G5 Laser Mouse,"Bought the mouse for my wife to use with her favorite game. Works very well, installed easily. Did not use the advanced features as the default setup worked quite well."
3,USB vs USB,While a good mouse (at least that's what is reported from the guy I gave it to) it doesn't play nicely with the Belkin Nostromo N52 game pad in use.
2,Some G5 issues to consider,"I am fairly adept comp user. I play Battlefield 2 and that's mainly why I bought the G5 mouse. It is very smooth, but I have had plenty of problems.For starters, the mouse cord is braided, which makes it MUCH stiffer than any other mouse cord I have ever seen. It restricted movement so badly, I used a razor blade and cut off the braided sleeve. That solved the problem, but God only knows who ever thought it a good idea to make a stiff mouse cord.I still do not have the software working adequately. I cannot get the resolution to change properly in-game. Additionally, I was having terrible lag in-game when trying to utilize a thumb button as a keystroke command.The scroll wheel is harder to rotate than other mice. Plus, the wheel click requires you to push down with at least twice as much force as any other mouse I ever had.I do like the way the mouse feels in my hand, but I would never buy another and I cannot recommend it."
5,OK for Lefties,"Most people dismiss this product as being a right-hand exclusive mouse. I actually bought it unaware that it is marketed as such. Being left-handed has been an altogether different computing experience (gaming and otherwise) for me.Well, that button intended for right-hand thumbs actually isn't a problem at all. The mouse's shape conforms to my left hand nicely. The thumb-button actually rests just under my ring finger (so a simple squeeze of the mouse activates the button).I LOVE THE WEIGHTS!!! I just dumped all of the heaviest ones into the cartridge and use it that way, but when I'm pumped for a game, I'll drop the cart entirely and my mousing ability/accuracy shoots upward, like with actual weight-training.My favorite thing is probably the context-switching button for DPI changing. The three settings are probably all I'd ever care for, and being able to swap precision when I play Starcraft is nice since it's a 640x480 game.Buy this mouse, you know you want to."
4,Great mouse for gaming and general work,This mouse has never missed a beat! The weighting system works well and lets me fine tune the mouse to my liking. I don't mind the cord and this way I don't have to recharge it.
5,Great for gaming,"After reading several of the reviews I felt like I should share my experience with this mouse. I've owned the G5 for almost two years, and have yet to experience anything negative.I bought it primarily for use while gaming, and it has been excellent. I loev the fact that you can program the buttons on the mouse to your liking (I programmed the keys for SHIFT, CTRL, and ENTER, multiple key combo's for gaming). I am a big guy and have pretty large hands, and I tend to really press the keys ""hard."" This mouse has taken my punishment and is still as responsive as it was on Day 1. The feet are still in great shape, after nearly two years of constant use without any mousepad.As far comfort, as I said above, I have fairly big hands, but this mouse lets my hand rest naturally for hours of gameplay.Overall, I highly recommend the G5 :)"
5,Awesome mouse for gaming or working,"I love this mouse! It fits great in my hand, tracks accurately and consistently, and I can adjust the speed on the fly. The included weights seem like overkill until you try making adjustments with them. They're a great touch, especially for a gamer. I've been through quite a few mice and this one's a keeper!"
3,everything great except one thing,"i bought this to complement my battlefield 2 gaming over a month ago. i have yet to play a full game using this mouse, and it is now back in its original packaging and put away.i have gone back to my MS intellipoint explorer 4.0a (800dpi). while it doesn't have the smoothness of the G5, i feel that the lack of second thumb button on the G5 is less acceptable.other than that, the G5 has that great on-the-fly dpi changing. hopefully logitech will wise up and bring back the second thumb button for their next series."
5,Great Mouse,I think that this is probaly the best high preformance mouse out on the market. It glides so smoothly and is great for slow presicion work or high paced internet browsing or gaming. I highly recomend this for gamers. I have tried the razer copperhead but to me this mouse is much more comfortable to hold and the sensitivity caan go to 2000 dpi instead of 1600 dpi Also my friends copperhead broke after 3 months of use while mine still runs fine.Pros-Adjustable weights-2000-800 dpi-Great sliding pads on the bottom-Extra side button for extra comands-On the fly sensitivity changes-Great ergonomicsCons-Not for casual computer users because of the price
1,Terrible for Gaming,"An issue that has been raised by other reviewers, but which is such a big problem that I have to mention it, is the middle mouse button: it is impossible to push without scrolling/tilting/moving the mouse. This makes the mouse incredibly frustrating to use firefox (middle-click often misses the link), much less play an FPS. There are better devices on the market."
4,Good mouse with some minor flaws,"Pros: Extremely smooth motion. Great ergonomics. DPI switching on the fly.Cons: The black rubbery substance attracts tons of dust. The spray painted look isn't as pretty as in the pictures. The software sucks.Overall, its an OK mouse. The problems with the middle mouse button are well reported here, but I programmed the mouse to detect the left tilt as well as the middle mouse button as a middle click. So it works perfectly now. The tilt function doesn't have much use of it anyway. The weight adjustment feature is a gimmick. The mouse is quite heavy anyway. Contrary to what is reported here, all the buttons can be programmed to work as you please in any game. You just have to tinker a bit with the SetPoint software. It should detect all buttons automatically, but it isn't much of a problem configuring it to work correctly."
1,Not worth the cost of packaging,This mouse is the jerkiest I've ever used. It is just not possible to actually reach any particular place on the screen because the mouse jumps 10 or more pixels in random directions. I will never buy another logitech mouse.
1,This would be a great mouse.... If it Worked!,Lately my game of choice has been 2142 and I picked up the G5 after my mates who are ALL Quake players swear up and down about it.Turns out the G5 gaming mouse is not compatable with 2142. How stupid are these guys to make a G5 with the 2142 game logo on the mouse and it's not compatable with it! Yikes!
5,best mouse ever,"This mouse is awesome. The adjustable dpi is great from switching from gaming to just browsing on the web. The smooth mouse feet eliminate the need to buy teflon pads for the mouse feet like other mice. I was skeptical about the effectiveness of the weights, but after the first use, I was already switching them around, trying to find the perfect match for me."
5,Great Mouse,"product was a good mouse, been using it for a year now and it still works perfect as it did when i first got it. i am a hard core gamer and it works amazingly with new games like Crysis and and old games like freelancer. it is nice to be able to custom your bpi rate for fps it is nice to switch to a higher rate in the snipper modes to be able to move faster and slow down right before you take a shoot.over all it is a good mouse and still works which is nice for someone that uses a mouse 5 to 6 hours a day for a year. all the buttons still work the paint is wearing off but that is expected for the amount of use i put in to it. it is also nice to have the cord because it saves me a lot of money for the batterys.this also works really well in ubuntu linux which is always great for computer geeks."
3,"nice features, poor comfort & ergonomics","after several days with this mouse, i started looking for the receipt to return it.it is uncomfortable where is presses into the bottom of my palm. the slope from the top of the mouse, to the bottom and sides, is too 'steep'. same problem with the mx518.my favorite mouse is the ""GE HO97997"" a $13 mouse at amazon.very comfortable for extended use."
2,5 stars unitl today... it broke down,"not the whole mouse, just the middle wheel. right now. Yes, I was raving on another review and the wheel spun off the tracker spindal(or whatever) and now just freewheels. The mouse, incidently was used in Dark Messiah. A game requiring much rigorous reflexes. BUT I was not totally abusive, just gaming with frequent spins(now keyed to hotkeys). DON'T USE WHEELS TO SELECT INVENTORY IN GAMES! Still, it should have lasted longer than 2 lousy months. And so it is a 45(os so bux) Pile of mouse droppings. I do not recomend the FATALITY eirther, the guy who invented the thing uses a professional equipment not designed for just commoners like us. HOWEVER the 2020 or the other weird one might be the ticket. I am leary about it as the 1010 wasn't that good either(at any game). I recomend another brand... logitech(as microhard) has lately been pedaling junk at brand price. I live by saitek. ALL PRAISE SAITEK!!! SUPREME FANBOY!!!! PRAISE BE THE ALMIGHTY COMPANY!"
1,"Broken out of the box, not worth the price","Generally agree with other reviewers here that the mouse is not worth the price. Mine was also unfortunately broken out of the box. Kudos to Amazon for their great and simple return policy. The main problem was that the mouse would cease to function and I would have to plug in and unplug again and again to get it to work again. After the second day the mouse stopped working altogether. The adjustable weight idea is an interesting concept, and the mouse is somewhat ergonomic (though to be honest I preferred the feel of my cheaper Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 4.0). Overall this device is definitely not worth the price, there are considerably cheaper mice to be had that are just as nice or better, with higher reliability. It used to be the Logitech put out really high quality devices, but I fear their quality is slipping now."
5,The gaming mouse,"This is a really nice mouse. The only bad thing I could even think of to say about it is that the adjustable weights that come with it seem out of place. For me, the weight adjustment did not add or take anything away. It just seemed kinda useless in my honest opinion. Aside from that, spectacular gaming mouse. The cord is a braided one, so that it doesn't get all tangled up after awhile. The software utility that comes with it is easy to use. The on-the-fly dpi settings buttons help while in game also. I think this is the best price vs. quality mouse on the market."
3,Good read,"Having exhausted Montana for the moment, the Calder saga has moved to Texas with the next generation. While I think Dailey's last book (Calder Promise) was better, she nevertheless does a pretty good job with the latest installment. The interesting characterizations are there (I think the Dallas could have been a little better, but Easy was great), and while the plot may be a little thin in places, it still works for the most part -- though it didn't seem plausible to me that Quint wouldn't call in the reserves when he started having problems.All in all, a decent read."
4,Better....but not the best!,"This Calder novel was way better then her last (Calder Promise), but still not as good as the first few in the series. I fell in love with Romance Novels because of this series. I think this novel left plenty to expand upon and I will look forward to the next installment! What a joy it has been to ""watch"" the Calders, live, love, grow and die...."
5,"Nice shoe, great price.","This shoe is not as light as similar Rockports or other Bostonians that I own, but it is put together well, wears comfortably and takes a nice shine."
2,Decent show for the price....,The shoe does what a shoe is supposed to do; but strangely it doesn't take a shoe shine real well. Good everyday CASUAL shoe - not a good dress shoe.
4,Funkyhell yeah,"If you are just getting into Haloblack, this album should be your starting point. It contains some of Bryan Black's catchiest beats. He isn't afraid of being experimental-yet-catchy, subtle-yet-driving. His trademark minimalist sound is prominent, but he still fills each track with subtle glitches, static and bleeps. Black has a talent of drawing in the listener, and after each track is over you're left craving more like a junky.If you like this album, you should definitely own his other two albums, Tension Filter and his newest, Throb (you can order Throb through Haloblack's website, thesickcity.com).My favorite tracks include Distractor, Regulator, Drylips, Fragment, and Resonance."
3,Not bad for his first book.,"I agree with some other reviewers, the main character hates himself way too much...it gets old listening to him whine so much. But the story is compelling and worth a read."
5,Why is this not available on CD?,"This is one of the classic jazz vocal albums -- hard to believe it is not available on CD or MP3. ""Ballad of the Sad Young Men"" never fails to move me to tears -- being an old singer myself, I find it hard to believe anyone could sing that song better than Mark. (Hey Mark -- if you're out there -- how about re-releasing it?)"
4,Embroidery Designs,I got this book for ideas for machine embroidery. It is an excellent book with designs I can easily translate into a machine embroidery patterns for digitizing. It is a good book with the old fashioned inspiration I needed. Note this book would be great for hand stitches also.
2,The picture is wrong,"The cat scratchers are great products, but I have to severely downrate them because the picture is NOT the product you get. The picture shows the SuperScratcher+, which is a double-wide version of the product. As the dimensions in the text show, this is not the double-wide version. Only buy this product if you expect the dimensions in the text. You will be as dissapointed as I was if you go by what you see in the picture."
4,Nice,"My cats LOVE this thing. They scratch on it, fight over it and sleep on it. It is very messy the older it gets though and doesn't last very long. Still, happy kitties."
3,Picture is not correct,"I ordered this one thinking to get a wide scratcher. But I received a small one. When I read the description carefully again, I found out it was small one. This picture shows wide scratcher."
2,larger than I expected to replace one,"\my reason I was unhappy is aabove but my husband said it's just okay so we did not see any reason, you get what you get"
1,book printing review,"The works of Ms Browning are beautiful, but don't get this edition. The print type looks like it was reproduced on a bad photocopy machine. I was very disappointed."
4,Worth reading and purchasing,"The book is written mostly in plain english that really helps in understanding authors ideas. And benefits the book reader with better understanding of some modern tendentions of common law in reference to the Germal law, and Model Penal Code."
1,I've never been depressed about beauty before.,"This is the most negative Beauty Guide I've ever read. It attempts to debunk nearly every single product in existence and cast plastic surgery as a gleaming beacon of hope. The writer tries to apologize for her plastic surgery loyalty early in, but her style is boring and self-centered, so it's hard to forgive her. This book doesn't get remotely helpful until about 150 pages in. It stops being helpful again at 250 pages. There is very little instruction, and only one section with any pictures to cite examples. It's like the author wrote a beauty guide that applies directly to her and only her. If you want to have a plastic surgery procedure sold to you, read this book. If you want to get excited and informed about beauty, read something else."
1,"Wow, a Beauty Book Sponsored by Exxon!","This book is a horrifying display of techno-chauvinism. Begoun insists that a regimen of chemically engineered and modified acid, petrolatum and mineral oil is the only way to keep skin clean and healthy, she even asserts that petroleum is natural and thereby no different then say olive oil or shea butter (Anyone else disturbed?) As the book progesses the advice becomes more and more caustic.While I wanted to keep this book to show my friends what ""bad advice"" truly is, I had to return it. In addition to being cheaply printed and unevenly cut, the book was missing pages 231-269, (the portion dealing with blemishes, which I can only imagine.)Don't waste your money or precious time; The Beauty Bible is a sure way to cosmetic damnation."
1,The Beauty Bible,This book is all fluff and gives very little actual information of products to use or buy. Information provided is very basic and answers are very generic. Disappointing
3,Great skincare advice; skip the cosmetics part,"I highly recommend her skincare advice for managing oily skin and acne: its sensible, easy to follow, and it works like nothing I have tried before, esp. milk of magnesia for shine control and salicylic acid for exfoliating pores. However, her one-size-fits-all approach to cosmetic colors and textures left me cold. Don't wear anything blue or green. Neutral matte eye colors, colorful cheeks and lips (creamy, not glossy). No color correcting powder (tell that to women with rosacea). No sparkles or luminescence. Pah-leeeeze. Cosmetics, like clothes, are an expression of personality and style. If you are clueless about make-up and don't mind looking like a suburban soccor mom, her style will work for you. Otherwise, for a more diverse collection of cosmetic ideas, check out The Make-up Book by Joy Terri."
3,"NOT the beauty bible, but close enough.","When I first saw this book, along with its companion 'Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me', I was very excited! I thought that I'd finally found a 'Consumer Reports'-type book on makeup. 'Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me' is very much like that priceless magazine, but you sometimes get the feeling Begoun is determined to dislike any high-end name brand simply on principle.Although the information contained in Begoun's 'Bible' is thorough and certainly well-researched, some of her suggestions (especially for skincare) are just plain wrong. Bear in mind that although Begoun does every cosmetics-buying woman a justice with this book, she is NOT a dermatologist.I found the book very informative and very helpful, but as with every other product purchase you will ever make in your life, you must decide what works best for you, never mind someone else's ""bible""."
3,HELPS TO SAVE $$$$$$,This book is a great reference for beauty products. I have used it many times to check product reviews. Recommend it to anyone.
3,Beauty Bible,"Book layout too complex to follow. Have tried several suggestions, most of them were not impressive (in my opinion). Gave the book away."
3,Paula's Done it Again!,"I do agree with Paula's advice and reviews on skincare, and have found a system that works for me. I had the previous edition of this book too, and the updated information was very helpful. The beauty application techniques are pretty classic and useful. However, I strongly disagree with some of Paula's opinions such as ""shimmery eyeshadows"" and not using certain colors. This may be just fine for some women, such as middle-aged executives and such, but makeup should be FUN and express your individually. It doesn't always have to look ""natural"" or intend to be. Though an attractive woman, not everyone wants to look like Paul Begoun! I'm in my early 40s, a long-time cosmetics addict, somewhat amateur makeup artist -- and I wear all sorts of colors and textures and, Paula forbid, even glitter sometimes! I'd take Paula's advice with a grain of salt -- apply what works for you and ditch the rest."
4,A Well Researched Book,"As a consumer reporter with experience in both television and print media, Paula does a great job on her books. Sometimes she does miss the ""joy"" factor. Let's face it, there are women that buy cosmetics for the packaging!Most of the informtion is ""of the minute"", but Paula does have her own cosmetic line, which could prove a problem for some readers. Overall, a great reference guide and you will easily save the purchase price the next time you go to the cosmetic counter. Jillian Hurley, AmericanBeautyAdvisor.com"
3,Nice little earrings,"I wanted some drop style turquoise earrings, but did not want to pay the price most of them demand. These are nice, but did not break the bank."
3,good,great price- can't beat that. keep in mind - these have more blue and less green in the stones. that was not obvious from the picture so they did not match my bracelet. otherwise- very nice
4,hmm,"skacore, never thought i would be buying a cd with that title. but i must say i love this band. the only problem i have is thier singer, he slips by as acceptible, but the other screamer is way better and should be the only singer."
3,"good, but not good enough","There is no other option than to agree with the other reviewers. the language section is bad (how do you call a waiter? how do you ask for the bill? basics that are not deemed important by the writers). The descriptions are sometimes uninspired..but most importantly...the information on Brazil's most important city, Sao Paulo, The city that is most difficult to find your way in, but that has far more to offer than Rio is limited to just 15 pages!"
1,Junior League visits Singapore,"Pure Drivel. This is possibly the worst guide book I've ever used. The guide has pretty pictures and a good map inserted in the back cover, but the narrative is written at a fifth grade level by a bored Junior League housewife. The book repeats itself, rewriting the same boring descriptions in different sections of the book. There is no understanding of the culture or history, no description of the public transport system and no development of the role of Singapore in Southeast Asian politics. The book thinks that everything in Singapore is just dandy, gives no warning of tourist traps and is best used by Cruise Ship passengers with a need to visit more department stores.I used this guide on a recent visit and had the worst meal (and the most expensive)on my entire asian trip following its suggestions. You'll learn more from ten minute talk with a cab driver."
1,waste of money,"save your money, not worth it. has a date of 2006, but is actually from the 80's. has picture of Merrill, Jay, and Wayne on hte back from today, but video is of Alan, Wayne, and Merrill. half of video is not even of the Osmonds, and it is only a 60 minute video! RIP OFF!!"
3,TRACKS ON THIS DVD,"Tracks on this DVD are as follows:The Osmond Brothers1. TAKIN' COUNTRY TO THE CITY2. YES MAMA3. WHERE DOES AN ANGEL GO4. HE AIN'T HEAVY, HE'S MY BROTHER5. GONNA BE A HEARTACHE TONIGHT6. IF EVERY MAN HAD A WOMAN LIKE YOU7. AMERICAN TRILOGYCurtis Young8. WHO DO YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA9. AN ANERICAN TRILOGYDanny Davies & The Nashville Brass10. SAN ANTONIO ROSE11. WRITE MYSELF A LETTER12. IN THE MOOD13. DOWN YONDER14. DIXIE15. BATTLE HYMN FOR THE REPUBLIC"
4,A book I open all the time for new ideas,"I own several of the Southern Living compilation books and this one is my favorite. I like the variety of ""family-tested"" recipes and I appreciate the way items are organized together for meal ideas. I use this cookbook constantly, no matter what the season!"
3,Acrobot,"I had fun trying to create different poses other than dancing dolls. The magnets on the tips are indeed delicate, and after several minutes of bending, I could feel that a couple of joints became loose. Decided I'd better stop."
4,Very funny entertaining Mormon Cookbook,This is very funny cookbook for those familiar with the Mormon (LDS) culture. It does not make fun of the religion only the culture so Mormons and non-Mormon will enjoy it equally. It has recipes. Includes such things as the Jello-Matrix for all occassions.
5,"comprehensive, nostalgic, delightful","It boggles my mind that the author actually did all that research to find out the dimensions, important events, descriptions, and in many cases photos of every major league ballpark ever to host a game. The result is a feeling like I imagine it would be to see a game at Fenway Park: a visit to a temple of baseball. The title could not be more perfectly chosen.Lowry has also promoted a bit of healing. Having recognized what any aficionado of baseball history knows--that the Negro Leagues of old were surely major leagues on a par with the AL and NL, except in recordkeeping--he spurs interest in a too-often forgotten part of baseball's past.This book is absolutely essential to the library of any true lover of baseball history."
2,"Nice art, nothing new","The description somewhat misrepresents the contents of the book. It is PRIMARILY a vehicle to present Fellows artwork, wrapped in some uninspired text and often-seen photographs. I could not find anywhere the ""personal insights"" referenced. If you like Fellows art and buy the book for that ALONE you will like it. The text is boring and rehashes common ground with nothing new or ""insightful""."
4,Great art telling an exciting story,"Nice summary and excellent supporting art. But where are the P-51s? Very good example of this type of book, would have 5 stars if the Mustangs were included!"
4,Nostalgic Fun Highlighting Cultural Changes,"This is a light set of interviews interspersed with cuts from ""educational films"" for early boomers. It will be a reaffirming nostalgic trip for them and a historical tour for those who were parented by them.The flashbacks are there showing how much our values have changed - and in some aspects some that have not - a real generation-gap bridger."
1,Do not spend money.,"I had a lot more interest in this movie when I saw it on the website than I did when I saw it on the screen. You should buy a real Spalding Gray (Swimming in Cambodia, Monster in a Box) instead of this thing.I mean, I don't want to denigrate the filmmaker, and it was sweet to gather all those stories from all those cool people (Laurie Andersen, Spalding, etc.), but it wasn't really necessary, and these are times when we should use our money on necessary culture."
5,Sexy as hell,This little teddy is awesome. My wife has large breasts which is usually an issue but it fit them just fine and the ability to expose the nipples and crotch means it doesnt have to end up on the floor after 2 minutes.
5,A deeply informative and richly textured book,"Dolgon strips away the Vanity Fair-style pretension and name-dropping absurdity so often associated with this topic and exposes a far more interesting Hamptons - a Hamptons of richly textured history, colorful and varied people, and deeply ingrained dichotomies, contradictions, struggles and patterns of inequality. Dolgon is original. He has chosen the more challenging path for this work. To be sure, a trashy love letter to New York Society would have found its summer readership. But Dolgon takes the less worn path, getting under the skin of The Hamptons and examining the area through the lens of its people and through multiple generations of social change. The result is a fascinating book and an original take on an area whose depth and meaning is so often overlooked for its pretty face. This is an excellent book."
2,"When Smith died, so did the book.","Thorne Smith died while writing this book. Even the beginning isn't up to Smith's usual quality. It was finished by Norman Matson, who plodded where Smith would have gamboled."
4,Peace!,"This book came out after September 11th. I thought it was going to be a bit irrelevant now, but it turns out that this book covers peace efforts in the present and past. It was very interesting and I definitely got something out of it. Since the US is still in a war state, the thought of peace is definitely worth a book or two."
2,Is this a real boker?,I question if this is an authentic boker knife. There are many fakes out there and I am skeptical about the knifes authenticity.
4,Compass dead on target,"The Brunton Classic Compass is a good choice for the price. It delivers everything that you'd expect from a maptop compass... plastic base, bearings marked around the housing, easily rotating needle color coded for north and south, it even has a place for a lanyard or string to be attached.The size is just about right for either a shirt breast pocket or to be carried in the hand in the field. The adjustment for declination and graduated measurements along the edge make it a most versitle tool.In short, I am very pleased with this unit, and will recommend it to my students in the upcoming compass orienting and map reading class I am about to teach next month.You could do a lot worse by buying a cheaply made compass. This one works well for the right price. Thank you Amazon."
3,Good Beginner Compass,"This `easy-to-read' compass is perfect for map and compass orienteering. It has a tool free adjustable declination for easy navigating and gives you graduations in degrees. The scale is in both inches and millimeters and the clear plastic makes for easy use on any map. Unfortunately, there is no site-mirror, which makes for a more accurate reading. It's small size and price (under $10!) makes for a simple, efficient compass when backpacking or hiking. It's a good beginner compass, but remember that you get what you pay for. For a little more money you can get a nice ""Lensatic"" military compass with a sighting-arm."
4,"Mmmmmm, Compassy!","This compass is just what you need if you're trying to navigate using maps. It's well made and very reasonably priced.The compass is easy to read and is well damped by the liquid inside.This isn't the type of compass you'd want to use for regular hiking, but it very well suited for use with maps and charts. Since it doesn't fold, you'd have a hard time putting it in your pocket.For normal hiking, I prefer a lensatic compass. It's very easy to shoot a bearing to a landmark. Brunton makes a pretty decent unit."
4,Excellent,"This an excellent, inexpensive compass which I use in the car for navigating. I understand that one needs a sighting mirror for serious work, but I just use it in the car. It has good visibility, is lightweight, accurate, and best of all, doesn't cost that much. It's cheap enough so that if I lose it, I can buy another one, and it's more than accurate enough for my needs. I like the green baseplate, which allows me to find it in low light if I drop it. The needle is quite responsive, and you don't have to jiggle the case to get it to move as in many cheap compasses. All in all a good, decent quality, inexpensive compass."
3,Can't Seem to Find North!,"I needed this compass just to detect a magnetic field, any magnetic field so the issue of this compass not finding north is really not an issue for me however, the fact that this compass can't seem to find north is something of a concern since this compass claims to be a compass! ;)"
2,expected better quality,"I bought this item to replace an aging discolored Suunto that is similar for charting topography maps. It arrived with the package damaged and the compass damaged. I contacted the company and they issued a refund after 1st offering to send me a replacement. If it couldn't survive shipping it certainly isn't tough enough for what I've put my Suunto through over the years, and this is made in America. So I declined a replacement and was quite pleased they refunded my purchase as I was just willing to just eat it financially as it was cheap cost and not worth the cost of returning. The compass went in the garbage but Trail Explorers Outpost is a great company with great customer service. I definitely would order something from this company again but one experience with Brunton compass toughness will insure I never buy a Brunton compass ever again."
1,compass is incorrectly oriented,"the compass i received does not give correct readings. I bought the compass in preparations for SAR work and a 4 day training by DCNR. The compass can not be corrected and is off each reading. Apparently i am unable to return it? Therefore i will purchase a compass onsite, at a local retailer!"
1,Burton Classic Compass,"This is a very poor product. The compass won't find north consistantly. It acts like something is interfering with the needle movement. I'm very sorry I purchased this product, a waste of money."
1,For Absolute Beginners Only,"Any compass without a sighting mirror is virtually worthless for all but the most entry level forms of navigation. This item can be used to get a general sense of direction, but not for bearings or map and compass work. (Bearings without a sighting mirror are something like +/- 5-7 degrees, which translates to many hundreds of feet error for a distant object. With a mirror and care you can get +/- 2 degrees.)If you are carrying something this big, you should expect it to be accurate enough for real navigation. If you need just general direction, there are smaller, lighter, and and cheaper items - or compass functions on watches of GPS units."
5,Where've you been all my life?,"This book has changed my game. I've tried everything, bought all the gadgets. Nothing helped. Your book was simple to follow and I especially liked the eye dominancy test. I can understand why the pro's line up at your door."
1,Over a month and haven't received,Supposedly sent on January 9th. Emailed on January 26th and they said they'd send a replacement. Received an email within an hour after the first one saying they were out of stock and would send when they came in. Emailed again on February 4th and told them to cancel if no product was in. Received email the next day saying the book was in and sending that day. Today is February 11th and no book yet.
4,Great songs from a blues legend,"An excellent collection of songs. The band assembled here is top notch, especially Matt ""Guitar"" Murphy playing a wonderful guitar. I really liked that it was a full band including a horn section with a few smoking sax solos. The songs here are strong ones musically and there is a nice variance of tempo between fast and slow. Memphis Slim is a legend and this CD does a nice job of showcasing him."
1,C'MON,"I can't beleive people on this site take this band's music seriously this is total noise.What the hell is wrong with you people.This band is sick and nasty for the sake of getting attention.The-y have nothing important to say or Growl about.The guitars areweak and annoying.The people that say this band have talent orjust as stupid this is nonsense,Barnes might as well speak inspanish,it's almost like these death bands are trying to make uptheir own languege.Now I don't have a problem with death metal.Ilike some.But this is annoying music with sadstic,nasty,perverselyrics that will only appear to stupid,pot-smokin,a**holes whodon't know what true metal is.Now as far as death metal that isactually good-Barnes later project Six Feet Under and Obituarythat is all.Listen to those bands don't waste time with this over-hyped band that are about as listenable as fingers down a chalkboard or even worse rap music(well maybe not that bad)."
1,absolute filth,this is the sign of the apocolypse. this cd is unbelievbly bad. this band and thier fans should be slaughtered. look at the lyrics. people like this deserve to be killed and put into hell. every one of the songs about having sex with dead children. absolutley disgusting.
1,These Guys Are A Joke!!!,"Man, this cd and ALL of Cannibal Corpse's cds SUCK! The beats are extremely repetitive and are completely lousy, the guitar riffs are even worse, the lyrics are beyond disgusting, the lead ""singer"" can't scream well at all and when when he trys it sounds like he's got a sh--load of food in his mouth. Most christian heavy-metal groups blow this crap away! To give you a short list, Living Sacrifice, Zao, Extol, Project-86, Blindside, P.O.D., Eternal Decision, Piller, Embodyment and Travail. If you ever some how get a hold of this cd, first smash the hell out of it with a sledgehammer and burn it!!! Peace."
3,Kinda boring....,"Honestly, I wanted to like this album; but it was a little boring for me. The guitar work is unimaginative and the drumming is at best mediocre(not fast enough). I enjoyed the first three songs, but after that it went downhill. The vocals are fine but a bit monotone, and the lyrics are pretty stupid. I'm more into Morbid Angel, Deicide,and Death and other faster bands; I wanted to like Cannibal Corpse but I'm just not a huge fan of gross-out lyrics and sub-par instruments(bassist is good though).Butchered at Birth was way better..."
4,Whoa!,"Dude, this is one seriously cool album! The guitars are really heavy (not to mention reminiscent of Metallica on ""And Justice for All""), and there are tons of wild rhythm changes, and cool solos. Chris Barnes is an hilarious vocalist. He'd better watch out or Steve Irwin may try to wrestle him. The lyrics are well, sick, but hey, just don't read them. If somebody swallows something, they'll work better than Ipecac! Check out that song ""Hammer Smashed Face"", it really rules! I heard that song in ""Ace Ventura"", and figured that was just a joke, not a real band, but it is! This isn't the best death metal you'll ever hear (that would be Vader and Morbid Angel), but it's definitely worth a listen if you like this stuff. And guys, don't take it so personally if people don't like this band. Not all of us are perverted enough to listen to it. I guess we're the lucky ones. Anyway, if you like death metal, buy this. Or, as Chris would say: bnvbndglhdhtrelthelrhlh...just buy it, okay?"
4,Pretty solid-3.7 stars,"And I'll have some of whatever the f@ck Lunaqua is taking. Seriously, you sound like a very brainwashed and scary individual.Anyway, the album is pretty good, but it is a little repetitive. Although this album has some of the most thought-provoking song titles.Favorites tracks: 1,2,and 3."
2,"3 stars, not 2!!","This CD definitely lies directly on the line of being average. The instrumentals are okay, but nothing too technically complex. Barnes' vocals include a unique grindcore style and are actually sort of impressive at times.Still, though, the album gets to sound a bit too much alike when attempting to listen the whole way through. After awhile, it gets a bit dissappointing.I think with a bit more complexity given to the instrumentals and varation in songs, CC could've had a smash hit CD...but unfortunately, that's not how it went...so I give this album 3 STARS (once again, not two) for mediocrity and potential."
5,cannibal corpse plays hard no matter who's on board,"no matter who the vocalist is, or the guitar ists, cannibal corpse ROCKS!"
5,not bad at all,"All in all, i think this is a damn good metal recording. If you can get past the violent cover art and lyrics, you might enjoy the sound of this band...Chris Barnes has perfected the fine art of low pitched growling, in both this band and his other band, Six Feet Under. The guitarists and bassist are very talented, especially on ""Hammer Smashed Face"", which has both a cool bass solo and a catchy guitar riff. The drummer is not the best in the business, but he proves that he can play very fast and keep a beat.Overall, this is a good CD that metal fans should have. Unless, of course, you were scared by the artwork"
4,Pretty Good,"This CD Is awesome but I only have 1 complaint. This guy can't sing unless you count dumping yourself in cold water going outside in -40 celsius weather then catching pneumonia and growling singing. I love the music and in fact love all music, but some so-called ""singers"" aren't great. I only gave the album 4 stars because of the singing. And also why would they make an edited version. I can just imagine this conversation in the store. ""Mom can I get this CD"" ""Oh no Billy the grunts and barfs might hurt your mind let's get the edited version"". But in the end save for Chris' barfing I mean singing it's a solid album. And as a drum player it's really influential."
1,You got to be joking,These guys are a joke. The lead singer doesn't even sing at all and the guitar sucks. They have no talent at all. Anyone can scream and yell and sing like a total idiot. It all sounds the same and it's pure garbage.
1,How ?,"How can someone listen to that? How can someone even think about producing that? It's pure garbage, played by musicians (?) who are talking to you like: ""hey, thanks for buying my stupid music."""
2,"Talented band for sure, but not really my thing","I like a wide variety of music, but honestly i find death metal somewhat unlistenable. No offense, but I really don't like the growling as vocals. The lyrics are stupid but that's not even the problem. I'm not one of those people who says ""Death metal is disgusting and is just noise"". I definitely respect it as music. I guess death metal is just a bit too extreme for me, I really can't stand those vocals. I don't mean that theres no talent here, because there definitely is. There aren't any nu-metal 2 and 3 chord riffs here, the songs are complex and technical. These guys are great at what they do, which is to play death metal, it's just not my style. If you like death metal, you will probably like them. I respect them, but I think I'll stick to thrash, power and progressive metal. Seeya later"
2,very fast... very unorganized,"Cannibal Corpse is okay if you want to hear some ridiculously funny lyrics about necrophilia and extreme sadomasochism (well, you can't really understand what Barnes is saying, so you have to read it out of the liner notes), but their music is so shambled it's amazing that they, or any other traditional death metal band can get a record deal. Very fast, yes. Organized? No. It sounds like they walked into the studio, started playing random guitar chords, and had Paul beat the hell out of his drumset, and add Barnes' animalistic death growl. Like I said, the lyrics are hilarious if you've got a sick mind, but the music isn't anything to brag about. But they're better than Mortician. The only Corpse album I can stand is The Bleeding."
1,This is Funny Stuff!,"If ""Cannibal Corpse"" is serious, then I feel sorry for them. If they're not taking themselves seriously, then THIS IS GENIUS! This is super-funny stuff! I mean, I Cum Blood? What in the hell is that? that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard! Halarious. On the other hand, if these mutant mullet-headed, reebok hightop and jean jacket wearing greaseball thugs who are using up precious oxygen think that a collection of cacophonic noodlings that sound like a grizzly bear got caught in a combine on AM radio think this is music, then they need to run, not walk, immediately to the nearest freeway and lay down in the path of a speeding truck and cease to exist so we can move on. Grow up you idiots. Garbage."
1,Piece of junk,"Stay away from this piece of nasty music. This is the kind of stuff that will put real metal underground forever: talentless musicians, obnoxious ""lyrics"". These guys must be insane."
2,I've heard better,"The newer stuff is so much better than this. I bought this cause of Hammer Smashed Face and after that track I was totally diappointed, the rest just doesn't live up to my expectations. If you like this type of music, pick up some newer stuff like GALLERY OF SUICIDE."
3,WOW. Wholesome lyrics.,"This CD was really good, but I found it hard to understand alot of the lyrics. I really wanted to, CC is just amazing at coming up with such gems. Personally, I'd rather listen to Slayer, but this was a really great cd, nontheless."
2,Cannibal Corpse=Zombie Death Metal,"This stuff is Crazy,Crazy,Crazy, abnormal and intense, the guitar sound is surprisingly tight. But the vocal are loooooowww. Probably the lowest Chris Barnes does. Too bad they couldn't get along with him. Next to Butchered at Birth,this is the 2nd best album."
2,Not what I was expecting...,When I purchased this disc I was expecting it to sound more like their other cd Adiago. It has quite a different sound and feel to it. If you are looking for some heavy electronic music then you will enjoy this but for me thats not what I was looking for.
4,overall a good book!,This book starts off slow but picks up quickly. When I first picked it up i was a little skeptical about it but I ended up really getting into this novel.If you are a book lover and love to read i recommend this book. If you are not then i would not recommend this book because you may get bored and you have to follow along with the many characters in the novel.In the novel a young girl named Natalie Armstrong finds out that she is a little different then her sister. She finds out that she was adopted and has no information about her real parents. Throughout the book it is an adventure to find her mother and meet her for the first time. It keeps you on edge because she runs into many problems and keeps you guessing. The ending is great!
4,A girl searches for herself,"This book is not as outstanding as number the Stars or The giver, but it is still excellent!!! It is beautifully written and very realistic. I strongly suggest it. It is very relaxing reading, something that you can do over a weekend or a long car ride. I strongly recommend it!!!"
2,Disappointed,"Although this arrived safely and I got it, I was disappointed with book. I already knew that which was in this booklet (not really a book). This booklet did not tell me anything new and I was surprised it was so brief."
5,Nice Polo!,"Great quality polo. Fits well. Shrank a bit upon its first wash, but still fits well. It's a good shirt that can go well with a variety of pants. Also it stays cool, as promised."
1,Sucked,"I ended up taping over my copy, it was only 1 cent. Take it as a cheaper blank tape, it worked very well."
4,Interesting looking back,"It is extremely interesting looking back on the general American view of Communism during the early sixties. This book picks apart the USSR's Iron Curtain in a rather unobjectionable way. I just used this book for a 10th grade paper. However, I found myself reading it for pleasure. Imagine that MTV generation reading historical novels for pleasure. This book MUST be somewhat good. A very thought provoking read if nothing else. 4/5"
5,Works great. Low price.,I needed this cable to connect our receiver to an HTPC. I originally used a TOSLINK-OPTICAL MINI ADAPTER by Dayton. The Dayton adapter caused the audio to intermittently cut out. Replacing the adapter with this cable fixed the problem. Don't be fooled by the low price. This item performs flawlessly and is high quality.
4,Great Product at a great price,Bought this cable for an unbelievable price and it works perfectly with my mac mini hooked to my HK home receiver.
1,Wont work with MacbookAir,Purchased this for the purpose of connecting my Macbook Air to my home stereo tbe cable is as described but the mini end is too fat and doesn't seem fit deep enough into the phono plug to work on the Macbook side. Be warned!
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought this cable, so I could have the sound from my macbook pro go through my TV. Received it and it doesn't work, the price was so cheap I didn't bother to return it."
2,"""You get what you pay for""","If you buy the cheapest cable, I guess it shouldn't be a surprise when it dies on you sooner than you'd expect, but it still sucks. I used to buy very expensive name-brand cables, but have slowly been going cheaper and cheaper. I've learned for some cables that see a lot of daily wear and tear (think: USB charging cables), it's more cost effective to buy 2 or 3 that are cheaper than a name brand counterpart because they last nearly as long at a fraction of the cost. This particular cable did not see a lot of daily wear and tear, in fact nearly none, yet it failed after about 6 months. I suppose the nice thing about digital cabling is that they either work or don't. There's no in-between. I've since replaced it with a name brand cable that was 3x the cost, I guess we'll see if the next step up was worth it 18 months from now ;)"
5,Excellent Inexpensive Connector,Its inexpensive and gets the job done. I interface this between my Mac audio output and a high end DAC. Nuff said.
1,Sent the wrong one!,They sent the wrong wire. I called and they said that they would send the correct one but never did. Don't ever buy anything from this company. Looking over the reviews I see that I'm not the only who has experienced this problem.
5,Work's like a charm.,"Arrived very quickly, and in great condition. I use this to link my MacBook Pro to my Sony AV Receiver mostly to listen to music but also for watching movies. Great sound for the few hours I've been using it. Very crisp, the highs are almost too high......but that may just be from my settings.....length was perfect and connections were snug and secure. Great price, great product."
1,Item Mislabeled,Ordered from seller Abacus24-7 and received plain TOS to TOS cable with a label of mini TOS to TOS cable. Ordered via amazon prime and returned at no cost. Just some time wasted. Would not recommend ordering the cable until they have fixed the inventory.
1,False Advertising,"Bought this cable expecting to receive a toslink (optical) audio to mini toslink connection and received a normal toslink to toslink cable. Beware. Do not order from this seller, false advertising."
3,Wrong size,"I probalby shouldn't rate this a 3 because if it were the right size it would be fine. And it's likely my fault for not knowing what the crud I'm doing. I need to connect a sound bar to my Philips LCD TV that doesn't have audio out jacks for some dumb reason. So i'm trying to use the SPDIF jack instead. I bought this adapter, thinking it would do the trick, but the end that goes into the TV (which is the male end) is too big. Are there different sizes of mini adapters? I would love someone to help me out here. I've had this soundbar for 2 months and am unable to use it."
3,Did not work,Shipped in great time but it didn't not work. Supposed to be a spdif connector for my computer but it didn't do anything. The spdif end didn't seem to be compatible. Reviews said it worked with their computer.
5,Non-Hormonal Alternatives,"This wonderful, sanity-saving book DOES offer a lot of non-hormonal alternatives for dealing with perimenopausal mental fogginess. The fogginess can be very frightening, and because I had breast cancer I'm not a candidate for HRT - I can't even use soy products. I thought I was doomed to several years of confusion, memory & vocabulary loss. Dr. Warga's book not only explains the medical reasons behind all of the symptoms, but also shares coping strategies other women have developed to deal with these symptoms. The fact that the symptoms go away was the best news of all. GET THIS BOOK! It's reassuring and informative."
2,Book should be retitled,"to ""Estrogen and the Mind"". Claire Warga does an excellent job of compiling the data and cases describing the very real symptoms experienced at this time of life for many women (not all women). Unfortunately, she immediately defaulted to estrogen as the SOLE cure - natural or synthetic. What about the other hormones that decline at this time of life? Why has there not been research on the effects of progesterone and the mind? Research is primarily funded by pharmecutical companies and they hold no patents on progesterone - surprise. We get only half the story with this book. Now most current research has debunked that estrogen is the cure for Alzheimers."
3,Sometimes less is more,"I found this book to be a long, repetitive and often tedious commercial for hormone replacement therapy. While the author makes many wonderful and important points about symptoms, the benefit of reading the book is reduced by the repetition of cases. I also was hoping for a more balanced approach with respect to treatment, but it seemed that just about every page touted HRT as the cure for EVERYTHING."
2,Poorly Written,"Dr. Warga may or may not have something to say about menopause and the mind, but for the life of me, I can't decipher her writing. I am amazed that Simon and Schuster let this book see the light of day without more editing. I've never read so many long, tortured, and confusing sentences. Good writing does matter."
1,Book is a few days late and a few dollars short,"Unfortunately, this book is an example of the fast-moving world of menopause ""facts"" as recent studies now show estrogen drugs worsened the condition of Alzheimer's patients. This book is one of many of its type that sells a lot of promising anecdote, but is little more than a badly disguised pharmaceutical advertising piece for failed drugs like HRT. Today's science, as shown in the Preliminary WHI study Warga talks about, is finding HRT far more harmful than helpful now that it is finally getting tested against a placebo. This book is for the bargain bin only as badly out of date today (6/14/2000). One year on the market and it has already been discredited by more current research. Save your money. And keep up to date on this issue with better and more current research and less drug industry hype."
3,no color reproductions of his paintings,"the writing i cannot comment on, but as a picture book of dores work, i found it dissapointing. not to say that there arent plenty of illustrations, but that the printing quality is poor on many of them, and there isnt a single color reproduction of any of his paintings."
4,Just delightful,"I came to the Southern Sister mysteries by way of a Christmas present, Murder Shoots the Bull. I was hooked! These sisters are so real, and their words ring true. After reading the last one first, I've gone back to begin at the beginning...Just finished Murder Runs in the Family. The quality is wonderfully consistent, reading any of them is a pure treat. I have only one complaint... it's not with the author, but with the editing. Ms. George is poorly served by editing that allows a jacket blurb to state ""Mary Alice has spared nothing for her ONLY daughter's wedding..."" (emphasis added) when in fact, Mary Alice has two daughters. Such poor editing causes the reader to mentally pause, and disturbes the flow of these marvelous books. That said... BUY THEM ALL, grab Mouse's afghan, and pray for snow."
5,Delightful,Anne George is a delight. Each of her books is more enjoyable to read than the last. She just doesn't write fast enough for this fan!!
5,Hilarious!,"I love this author -- and the characters. The books are very clever, entertaining, and a fun read.Amazon's website is easy to use and the price is too good to pass up."
5,Southern Sister series is a good read over and over again!,This is the third time I have read this series. What a hoot ! When you need a good chuckle this fits the bill!
5,very usefull,this is a good read on how to introduce spiritual practices in your life and congregation
5,Know Why You Believe,"This an easy to understand book about basic Christian beliefs. A lots of books dealing with Christian Theology bog the reader down with long words and hard to understand concepts, but this is easy to understand and easy to read. The book might be an easy read, but it really packs a punch. It tackles the big questions like ""is Christianity Rational?"" ""is there a God?"" ""Did Christ rise from the dead?"" ""Are miracles possible?"" and ""why does God allow suffering and evil?"" This a good book for a long time Christian, someone new to the faith, or someone that just wants to know more about Christianity."
4,Love 'em,"I bought these, and a super expensive pair of DKNY Mary Janes - by far, the Rockports were so much more comfortable and actually looked more ""expensive"" than the DKNY's .... so much so, that I returned the others and kept the Rockports."
3,very narrow fit,"I always buy an 8B but this is definitely not a standard B fitting. I could tell as soon as I took out of the box just how narrow the sole is and narrow across the toes too. Does have good padding but unsure if it will stretch to be wearable. Lets face it, its not an exciting fashion shoe, but its supposed to be comfortable from Rockport! I bought 2 Rockport shoes, same size, this one too small and the other is too big! Disappointed and the first and last time I will buy this brand."
2,Never use anymore,"I have used this flash with an EOS 600, EOS Digital Rebel and an 1Ds Mk II. getting the correct exposure out of this flash was always difficult. I finally decided to shell out the cash and buy a decent flash such as Canon's 580.I would not recommend..."
4,Better then nothing,"This flash works fine if you don't want spend lots of money on flash. I had this work good on my Rebel2000 and better than speelite 200e.It's cheap, not look like pro-Flashs light, but hey works great for me."
2,hardly a Bible handbook,"I bought this book when I was just beginning to study the Bible. Although it has some helpful charts, this book hardly contains a wealth of information useful to understanding more about the Bible. This book focused on trying to explain the Holy Spirit almost to the exclusion of everything else. I would suggest staying with the tried and true such as Matthew Henry or Halley's Bible Handbook for a much better guider to understanding the Bible."
3,hard to find anywhere else,"I very much enjoy this translucent compact. I especially love the line of Dr Hauschka products. The only thing is that I wish this particular product was NOT made with talc. The loose powder isn't. Talc is NOT good for the skin. I'm still looking for something similar, but without Talc."
5,Absolutely Incredible!,"True Hard Rock at its finest. All the pieces are in place on this debut album. Mark Reale's guitar is excellent from riff to solo; Guy Sperenza on lead vocals is amazing! From ""Desperation"" to ""Overdrive"" to ""Angel"" this album ROCKS the entire way. If you're are looking for that void between Sabbath and Priest of the mid to late 70s and the NWOBHM movement, this is it. Good old american (NYC) rockers! An early metal ""must have."""
1,Not what i expected,"I thought I would get a little history and some good tips, but I couldnt even finish this one. This is a academic study. It is not a practical guide that I though I could learn some tips from."
5,Great book for the archery hunter,Between this book and Hunting the Hard way by Howard Hill I am excited to try traditionalBow hunting this year.
2,Better books out there,i got this cause it was cheeper then the one i was looking at. Better books out there in my opinion only.
3,Pricey bit of fun,A nice book with interesting information. Seemed a bit expensive after reading through it the first time. Good photos and well described steps. Good fun for this summer. I just wanted more.
5,Hunting With the Bow and Arrow,"I found this book to be informative and deeply intresting. The history on Ishi, the last Yani tribesman, was compelling. This book is a ""must read"" for any traditional archery enthusiast or anyone intrested in Native American history."
1,Terrible,"This book is useless. If you're looking at buying this book, most likely you already know what Akai MPCs and SP-1200s are, which is pretty much all there is to learn from this. This is supposed to be a 'how-to' guide, but it doesn't explain how to do anything. In fact, the only time the book even mentions MIDI is when the author mistakenly refers to the MPC as a 'MIDI Production Center' (as opposed to 'Music Production Center').The book is also littered with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes."
4,great start up material.,This book will help the startup artist/writer with a few pointers on getting started. You will enjoy the reference material.
3,Some pros; some cons,"I purchased this stroller for my daughter, because she has a 3 year old and a new baby. It was her selection, because she did the research on safety and convenience for accomodation of her matching Graco infant car seat carrier. This stroller is fairly easy to handle with both children in it. It is on the heavy side. I can't see my grandson in the front seat with the carrier in the back seat. My biggest concern is the fact that it will not fit into my daughter's Tarus trunk or my Lexus trunk. It is to deep when folded down to put in and the wheels are substantially large. I struggled trying to make it fit, but was too exhausted to try further. It's a hassel, so what you need is an SUV/open trunk style car for transporting this stroller. That is not good, considering we can't go out and buy a new car to fit the stroller. I'm not sure what she will do about it, as she needs the stroller for outings."
4,WE LOVE!!!,"My wife and I bought this stroller for walks, and it works great. we haven't had any problems with it technically, but we did notice the juice holders and plastics are not very sturdy. You just have watch out when storing and putting away, don't bang the plastics or they will break."
1,Didn't even last a month!!!,"This stroller didn't even last a month before it started to fall apart... The handels were the first thing to go. One by one they came off. I ended up having to duct tape them back on. Then the netting around the seats got big holes. Then the drink holders came off while folding it up. I had this stroller 6 months, it was so sad that when I tried selling it at a yard sale I only got 2 dollars for it. I really recommend a side by side instead because these types of strollers are so hard to push and turn. If you don't believe it put the kids in and drive it around the store a few times."
5,a book of understanding and compassion,"""The Sterile Cuckoo"" was an excellent book. I read it this past summer in between some dry readings that I had to read for a research paper, and this book really kept me alive. Pookie Adams was the kind of person that I would like to become, a strong independent spirit."
4,"With a Fast, Pookie-like Pace","The Sterile Cuckoo is a great book. It combines two college students, a life-like plot, and some great monologue to create a powerful story. So powerful that it will make readers relive the college relationship they once had. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to relive their college relationship, wants to know what a college relationship is about, or just wants to read a funny, wild book."

5,Memoirs Of Madame Vigee Lebrun,"As an artist myself, I was fascinated by Vigee Lebrun's very prolific and successful career. This book does not go into her training or working techniques very much, however it does talk about specific paintings and conditions under which she worked. What was very interesting was her description of the French and Russian aristocracy during the years that lead to their death and destruction. I enjoyed reading about them from the point of view of someone who not only worked with those people, but counted them as close friends."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in that I found the writing rather boring. It's in her own words and being that it's from a very long time ago, her descriptions and her way of thinking was a bit tedious for me. I realized that I would rather read a more modern writer's words about her."
4,Revealing book from 11th Century on Attaining Love,"This is the sort of book you look for, not a scholarly book compiled from various sources and presented for a modern reader, but a treatise written at the time that Courtly Love was at its height in France. This book consists of three sections. The first has dialogues between men and women of different classes, which are of a man trying to reason with a woman for her love.In the book there are two nice stories, but the third section was the most suprprising. The first two sections summarize therules of love to a young man the author knows named Walter, but in the third he gives his own opinion about pursuing loveand women to the boy that gave what seemed like a light work the ending of a heavy and controversial commentary.I liked it, and you will especially as preparation to reading books of the era such as King Arthur. I gave the book a rating of 8only because the dialogues all seemed to be similar, but on the whole its a great book."
4,STRICTLY FOR A JAZZ PURIST WHO HAS A DEEP APPRECIATION FOR TRADITIONAL JAZZ BEING PLAYED PURE AND SIMPLE!,"Jazz the way it was meant to be played...PURE AND SIMPLE!!! This is NOT for those raise up on Kenny G, Kim Waters, Etc. This is for those who are into John Coltrane, Pharaoh Sanders, and early Miles Davis...You should get the picture I'm trying to paint here. A very enjoyable album throughout!"
2,"Cheap, poor quality product","This is the same pump sold by Carter, Airtex, Precision, and several other company's for less money.In fact, I BELIEVE it's even the same pump sold by the vendor under their own brand name, Herko Automotive, for less than half the price It is advertised several places on the net as ""A high Quailty, superior design"", etc. etc., and it's CHINESE CRAP. Says on the box: ""assembled in the U.S.A. from components sourced from several countries"" Translation: Made in China. I could have bought the same EXACT pump from my local Autozone under any of the above brade names for less money. Not really even the vendors fault, (altho they probably know all this), just the way business is conducted these days. BTW, good luck finding a real American made pump, they no longer exist."
1,I wish it had worked,"My dog is not interested in this product at all. In fact, he seems to hate it. I go outside and spray the area of the grass, come back in and take the dog to the area; after the his first sniff of the area he immediately wants to run away from it. I have given it several tries with no luck. However, it could easily just be my dog. We adopted him recently and there are very few things that don't make him nervous, so I'm not surprised he seems to be afraid of/hates this product. I hope it works for some people, but unfortunately it doesn't work for me :("
1,Doesn't work!,"I tried to get my dog to use the puppy pad easier by using this, but he actually was afraid of the smell and peed right next to the puppy pad. What worked is actually spraying lavender on the puppy pad and he went right away on it. Go for the all natural solutions and save your money."
1,"Simple Solution Puppy Aid Training Spray, 8 Ounces",This item does not work. My dog was not attracted to the scent to go potty on a puppy pad.Very disappointed.
1,waste of money,"I purchased this item and tried it with my 7 month old pug. He did not pay any attention to it at all, Then I tried skip to my loo also purchased from Amazon, and my puppy smelled it and went to the bathroom in that spot. I use it a few times a day trying to train him on a new spot to use the restroom and it seems to be working very well."
1,My Dog Did Not LIke,"Once sprayed my dog would not even go near the area. She acted like is ""stunk"" to her. Does not mean product does not work but for my particular dog I had NO Luck."
1,bogus,i have a yorkie. notoriously known for being difficult to house break. this product did nothing for my puppy. wherever i sprayed it just made him want to lay in the spot but pee everywhere else.
1,Must taste good,This product seems useless for its intended purpose. My dog has not peed anywhere near it. She does lick up the spray whenever I spray it someplace. Save your money for carpet cleaner.
1,didn't work,didn't work. my yorkie sniffed it a bit but it didn't que her to go on the pad...waste of money
1,Why did I think this would work?,I bought this when I bought the fake grass potty pad thingy. I used it to entice my dog to use the puppy pad during the rainy season. Where ever I sprayed it he would sniff it and move on. Didn't work for my boy. '
1,made no difference,"I have a toy poodle who is hit and miss with his wee-wee pads. So, I thought that if I used this spray, it would attract him and give us more hits and lessen the misses and messes on the carpet. Unfortunately however, this spray made no difference at all--not even after applying more and more of the solution. So, its back to the pet store--which has a great return policy. Amazingly, what I have found even more effective than the wee-wee pads is just plain newspaper. Go figure."
1,absolute waste of money,Our new tween-aged dog ignored it completely. we even poured out a large puddle of this and she tried to drink it. not exactly the intended result. save your money and get a book. or just get someone else's dog to visit your yard.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I wish I thought of this scam a long time ago. It simply DOES NOT WORK!!! Don't waste your time or money!!!
4,My dog loves this!,"We received this with a dog potty that we recently purchased and, so far, it's working great! The only downfall is that she loves to rub her face in it after I spray it on the potty grass. But it definitely makes her go in the right spot. I usually spray it on the grass just before I think she needs to use her potty and it's training her away from using her normal spot in the yard."
1,My cat ended up using it,"I bought this for my new puppy, be he just ignored the sprayed area. One of my cats, which knew how to use litter already, ended up peeing on the sprayed doggie pee pad. I think it really depends on pets =/"
4,Took a while! BUT IT WORKS!,"have a silky terrier...with the cold weather here in the northeast, its impossible to take my dog for walks...had a PEE pad in the house for over two weeks and the dog never used it. Bought the spray and still no luck. Put the pad outside and the dog pee'd everywhere but the pad. Even with the spray wasn't much luck. Finally I started spaying the pad before we let the dog out, without the dog seeing me so it would think another dog used his pad. IT FINALLY WORKED! even after a while the dog stopped peeing on the pad, and used the spay and almost right away went on the pad. Now i use this spray sparlingly, the key is just to have it go on the pad once with the spay. Def. works well with a handful of treats!"
2,Does not work,I bought this after a friend of mine said it works wonders for her puppy. I sprayed it on the pee pads and the dog when everywhere but on the pads. My friend said it works for her. So it might work or it might not. Didnt for my puppy.
1,Does not work..,This did not work for our 4 month old yorkie puppy...Waste of money.. I tried many time over a period of 3 weeks..no way will the puppy pee where I wanted him to.
1,Dog barks at the puppy training mat!,"Bought this for my 11 week old scottie, she just started barking everywhere I sprayed it! She went mad! Barks at the puppy mat, turns around and pees on the floor. Waste of money, might keep it incase she starts to chew something, then spray it on that!!"
1,Doesn't work.,"Works about as well as the Potty Patch - don't waste your money.Might work for a young puppy, my adult dogs paid no attention to it."
2,really didn't work,used to help pottie train my puppies on the pee pads but they didn't seem like the spray did any good I would not buy again
2,Did not work for me at all.,"I carefully followed the instructions and every time ended with the same result (failed), my then a 11 weeks old Siberian Husky used the facilities everywhere but where I sprayed. I did it old school, took her out every 10, 20 30, 40, 50, 60 minutes and increasing the time slowly and pricing her every time she did it outside, she is now a pro with no accidents so far."
3,Didn't work for me,Got this out of desperation to help house train my yorky. Didn't work. He liked the smell but would just roll in it.
1,Waste of time and money,"Does not work, at lease with my pit bull. Would not recommend this product to an enemy. My puppy likes to lick it up. This product was very disappointing."
1,Malo el servicio,No me han entregado aún el producto ni hay el ID tracking para poder rastrear y ya me cobraron de la tarjeta de crédito
2,Not too impressed...,"It worked the first few times I used it to get my pup to pee in the mulch bed instead of on the lawn, but now it seems to have no affect and she is back to the lawn."
1,Water in a bottle,The title should explain it all. Of anything I ever got for my puppy this and the potty pad are two of my biggest regrets. Useless and unnecessary. Never saw this spray work once....going to have to stuff it my purse and use it as a pepper spray substitute just to stretch my dollar.
5,Great soap for sensitive skin,I have very sensitive skin and this soap helps keep it nice and smooth. I love the smell and it's one of my favorite from the Kiss My Face soaps.
3,Not GWAR's Best but Still Decent,"I'm more into GWAR's metal albums. This album is pure punk but good punk. Songs to me are good but not great on this album. Standout tracks to me are ""I'm in Love with a Dead Dog"", ""GWAR Theme"", ""World O' Filth"", ""Americanized"", ""AEIOU"", ""Pure as the Arctic Snow"" and ""Rock N' Roll Party Town"". Not the first album you should get from GWAR but definately a punk masterpiece."
3,"For first try not that bad,if this is your type of music!","The first album by Gwar is, as with any other debut albums,is rough and basic.The possibility for improvment is there.On songs like AEIOU are basic but they have a playful beat that gets you thrashing in no time.Techno Desructo's theme song is very complicated in which its set on a different world where Techno Dectucto and Oderus Urungus fight it out for the control of the band and ultimatly the fete of the planet Earth.If you are too serious a person this album is not for you.Only people with a sence of humor will enjoy this record, and enjoy itthey will. It is a good start for a group who claims that everyone will be their sex slaves or die triing to be their sex slaves. I say buy it!!!"
3,Hello-Gwar,"As much as I love scumdogs of the universe, this CD is unique in one respect. Oderous SINGS! Unlike any other GWAR release!"
1,Excuse me while I take a dump on this CD,"This CD is an environmentalist's best friend! I am now a big fan of plastics being recycled and used for better things, such as bedpans."
5,great compass,I'm using this compass to align my telescope. The compass works great and is easy to use. I can put the edge of it to the edge of the telescope and get a true north reading.
3,It Stopped Working,"I previously bought an expensive folding compass that was attractive, sturdy and well-made. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to use it! This little compass is easy to use, fits in your pocket, and has a nice price. But--fast forward a year--for some reason, it no longer works. Strangely, the directions are now wrong (North is now South). I don't know if I somehow demagnetized it, but my recommendation is to spend a bit more on a better-made compass."
4,learning basic skills thru music,great for my special needs children particularly song #2...put your hands up in the air...
4,Delighted- Kinder Kids love it.,"Had the tape in the 90s. CD is good but there are less songs on this Cd, but 3 songs are my all time favourites. I have been teaching Kinder aged children for over 15 years and these songs still remain my favourite. I am DELIGHTEDKindergarten Kids love colours, hand up in the air and what are you wearing. Awesome songs.Teaching listening skills, memory recall, colour recogniton, body parts, rhyming. Songs are very catchy."
5,Review on Hap Palmer,Hap Palmers music inspired me when I was little so much that it was the first music I bought for my little girl. She is only one and already enjoys listening to every minute of it. We are so pleased with our selection and want to express that to everyone reading this. thank you
3,"Not great for home use, but great for daycares and preschools","They're cute songs. Not annoying. probably great for educators. (I'm donating this to his daycare). But really designed for group activities.But, kinda silly at home for a parent and one toddler."
4,Some Really Catchy Songs,"I purchased this product for my Kindergarten Students. This CD was originally made in 1969. You can certainly tell that this compilation is over 30 years old; many of the songs are dull and would be unappealing to today's youngsters. Still, there are a couple of really catchy action songs that are great fun. One involves colours and listening skills and the other involves actions. I am so glad I bought it. My students love the ""Colour"" song and so do I."
2,Not as good as cheap ribbon antenna,"I bought this antenna because some reviewers loved it, and I wanted improved reception on both AM and FM stations without having to rig up an external antenna. I connected it to my stereo receiver, and compared the sound quality with that from my old, cheap antennas that came with the receiver (a 300-ohm flat ribbon antenna for FM, and a small plastic loop antenna for AM). The Terk came up short to both, regardless of how I oriented it.Maybe this antenna helps in some situations, but it didn't help me. I returned it yesterday for a refund."
1,Not worth the money,This product installed easily enough and that was all that is good about it.I live in a area with several strong AM and FM stations and even the strongest are full of static and very weak.Don't waste your money.
1,Did not work for me!!!!!!!!!,"The device looks good but doesn't improve the signal as I expected , I need to search more and look for deferent Brand ... feel like I just wasted my time."
1,Bad,I was very disapointed in the FM Antenna. I have not been able to pick up any radio station with this product.
1,I'm so glad it was cheap!,"With high expectations, installated on my receiver per directions. Extremely weak signal. Installation instructions rechecked. Looked correct. Re-, rechecked installation instructions and reinstalled. Same pitiful result regardless of location. The silly FM antenna wire and AM loop that came with the receiver were VASTLY superior. Forget about it."
5,Great Little Signal Magnet!,"This indoor antenna was installed in my home that is neatly nestled in a radio hole, beneath a mountain. I can't even get a cell signal. I'm happy to report that it was the simplest install imaginable and it now spends its days merrily pulling in quality signal from stations I didn't even know existed! Excellent purchase, high quality product!"
4,TERK did not let me down,"The AM/FM reception on my new Harman Kardon receiver was poor at best even though located only 15 or 20 miles from most of my desired radio stations. Someting had to be done. Reviews, for the most part of my TERK product, left a lot to be desired. Oh well, why not order and give it a try. Initially, resuts were only fair; however, when moving the two antenna units closer to a window, at an elevated level, it did the trick. Maurice"
2,No Improvement,I returned this item (Amazon is great about returns!) because this antenna made absolutely no improvement over the loose wire OEM antenna that came with my receiver.This is not the antennas fault; I have three walls between my receiver and the direction of the stations so I'll probably have to go with an outside antenna.
5,Love the new atenna!,"We live in a rural area and radio reception is scetchy at best out here, but since we got the Terk AM/FM radio antenna we can pick up the stations that we were missing."
2,Didn't work for me,"Bought this hoping the connections and adaptors would work with an Onkyo receiver's FM antenna connection, which is the same threaded co-axial configuration as your cable TV. This unit came with an adaptor, but its designed to push into the regular push-fit FM coaxial antenna and provide two wires coming out the back. QED it won't work with the Onkyo receivers."
4,works well,I am pleased with its performance. Getting radio reception in my area has always been frustrating. So I purchased this to help and it does.
1,don't waste money,looks nice. decent quality build. BUT!!! it only allowed me to pick up about 2 stations more than NO attena at all. They shouldn't even manufacture this thing! I wound taking this cheap wire that came with a boombox from years ago and plugging that into my Denon Receiver and spreading it out to get reception. that silly wire picks up a ton of stations and this thing that cost something picked up next to nothing! VERY DISAPOINTING!!!!!I will say that I was very pleased with the purchase through Amazon and the company that shipped it out. As always I've been pleased with how quickly I recieved the product!
1,Does not deliver,I purchaed this Antenna hoping my HD radio reception would improve. Unfortunately the reception is far worse than the standard wire-loop antenna that came with the HD radio.
1,FN-AM indoor antenna,"I tried it with my new Pioneer A/V receiver. It did not work very well. I am using the simple wire antenna that came with the unit. I may try it again. I have found in the past, the simple all directional out doors antenna is the best way to go for FM . A long wire AN out doors antenna works real well for AM."
5,Succeeded At Its Mission,"I bought a wonderful Grundig s35 radio, which works wonderfully in my Los Angeles home, but which suffers in performance at work, a college, because of so much interference in the building. I bought the Terk antenna to see if I could get KPCC, a Pasadena station about thirty miles away. The Terk succeeded. Whereas without the Terk antenna I could barely get KPCC, about 10% clarity, with the antenna this often tough-to-get FM station now comes in with over 90% clarity. Also all the other stations, both FM and AM, are now much stronger and clearer. So I'm glad I bought the Terk. Finally, let me add that the hook up is easy. You just snap the attachment to the back of the radio. Finished."
4,Good looking (at least as far as antennas go) and works well,"This antenna is much better looking than a wire antenna and does a very good job of being an antenna too. I get excellent reception with it. My only quibble is that there is small slot in the plastic where you can run the antenna wires through to route them out the back. This little slot is wide enough for the AM wire, but is not wide enough to accommodate the FM wire so you have to run it out the side and then back. Not a major problem, but you have to wonder how they could make such a mistake. If not for that this would definitely be a 5 star product as it is reasonably priced, looks good (better than in the picture here, which makes it appear huge - it isn't big at all) and works great!"
2,Underwhelmed by Reception and Size,"This antenna did not offer good reception. In fact, unless ""aimed"" precisely, it seems to be no different than having no antenna. Additionally, it is large and awkward."
2,Pull in strong stations - but I need help on the weak ones,This pretty much sum up my experience. It is realy easy to set up but it is not helping me where I needed. The weak station remains weak. A powered antenna should help but my experience is that powered antenna also introduce much interference. Placing it close to windows should help - the location of my stereo is in the middle of my house.
1,JUNK,"This is a piece of junk. It did NOT improve reception on any of my radios. If it were more expensive, I would have returned it."
2,Waste of monry,I noticed a very slight improvement from a small single wire antenna supplied by the receiver manufacturer.I don't recommend.
2,Not worth the money,I have poor reception where I live and was hoping this would improve my reception which it didn't.
1,Terk AM/FM+ Antenna,"This product worked should not be sold, as it contains hazardous chemicals if it falls and opens, as I found out. It smelled awful. There was some powdery substance in it that I thought might be something that is not supposed to be inside buildings or houses, it smelled so bad. I would not recommend purchasing this product as it is made of cheap materials that, if this product falls and opens up, has awful fumes it leaves behind. I have put it in the box it came in and am going to dispose of it in the hazardous waste facility."
1,"One word - ""lame""","I've had this antenna for a few years and found my receiption is still poor, constantly moving the antenna to receive reception. It would be best to spend a little more money and buy a better antenna then waste your money on this."
3,Use this in the city,"I purchased this for inside use to hide in the entertainment center. But.....I live 25-50 miles from the radio station and all the walls in my house have foiled backed insulation material, and the windows are low-E (lined with metal), so it is not surprising it would be hard to get a good signal inside the house. This antenna did improve the signal vs the T wires on the wall, but still can't get FM in stereo mode, except maybe once near station that plays music I don't listen to.Its worth the money if you live in the city."
1,Not better than built in Antenna.,I have the Sangean WR-11 radio. This TERK antenna resulted in worse reception than the internal antenna in the radio. Very disappointing. I returned the antenna.
1,Not very good,"bought for my sound system (replacing the long wire that came with the sound system).There were a few FM stations that I was not able to get with my other antena and I thought this antena would but it gets the exact same stations as my other antena and cannot pick up all the stations in my area.The AM antena is equally bad,Would not recommend."
5,Best ever,"I thought the first edition was terrific. But the newest one is even better. This books contains BOTH mainstream and complementary therapies -- all the latest studies. It's easy to read, and yet my pediatrician said SHE learned new facts from it. MUST HAVE on any parent's bookshelf."
3,If I could only hear,"I really cannot evaluate with any certainty...the audio was awful. Could not hear what they were saying.I am a fan of Stana's via Castle, and was looking forward to viewing her performance. I would never order another Video from Amazon. Your product is imperfect."
5,For Lovers Only,We love Stana Katic. I am not thrilled with watching movies on the Kindle Fire so we watched it on our PC which was much more enjoyable.
2,Another Bad Paris Movie,"This movie suffers from the same thing as ""Midnight in Paris"" - it's just an excuse to film in Paris.The writing/plot is extremely weak. The male actor (Mark Polish) is not good.I gave this movie a chance but it's just totally unnecessary."
1,Boring!,"The same exact thing over and over. Nothing but sex and running through fields. They are trying way too hard to make this movie ""beautiful"" that it was obvious and annoying to watch. Plus it promotes having an affair which is never the answer to an unhappy marriage."
1,Waste,Waste of time. Crap. Waste of time. Crap. Waste of time. Crap. Couldnt follow what the story meant or what the movie was all about...Dont waste your time or dollars
2,"Still welcome, but not definitive","Tiresomely derivative as 'the blue mask' remained tenaciously fastened to his fevered brow. Sublime moments less in evidence on this sadly final outing, and shrouded by a supine fog."
5,Mmmhmmm.,It's a cute tongue ring and the balls hardly ever come unscrewed when they're not suppose to. Yup.
5,Great Video,"This DVD gives an excellent presentation on the formation of our universe. I use it in the classroom and take advantage of the scene selections. It is a bit dramatic about end of times, but draws students in. Stu"
1,Subtract a Star,"What a terrible textbook. I can't begin to tell you how bad it is. There is no explanation for anything. I don't know why people assume we already know what they are supposed to be teaching. The whole point is to LEARN not review. The explanations are so short, as if they expect you to just grasp it. I haven't even bothered looking through it, except for doing the homework. It won't help..."
1,VERY Disappointed,"My wife wore Cachet for years. We both can pick out the scent upwind in a hurricane. She even has a jewelry box that has some cotton batting in the bottom that had Cachet spilled in it, and it still smells of Cachet to this day. Whatever the stuff is in this bottle, it's not Cachet. Not the original anyway. Not by a long shot. It smells like the cheap aftershave your creepy uncle wears. It doesn't even look right. It's far darker and more amber than the original was. The original recipe may exist and may be available somewhere, but this isn't it. This is nothing but a rip-off. (And now of course, adding insult to injury, I see in small print that this item cannot be returned.) Save your money. Unless you've got a creepy uncle who has a birthday coming up."
5,Glad to find Cachet again.,"I am allergic to many fragrances, which give me horrible headaches. Cachet is just about the only cologne I have ever been able to wear. It is a light scent, not heavy at all, and I always get compliments on the fragrance. I haven't been able to find it in stores for several years. I am glad to still be able to get it on Amazon."
5,BRAVO DAVID!,"The fact that the left HATES this book should want to make you want to read it without hesitation.Reading Uncivil Wars (and all Horowitz's books) will awaken the reader to the hard left's hidden and nefarious agenda for America.The ""BIG SECRET"" Horowitz proves in so many of his works is this: what the left tells you publicly - whether it be in the news regarding reparations for slaves, or in their reviews of Uncivil Wars - think the exact opposite and you'll be exactly right!Nuff' said."
5,Fight the Power!,This book is basically in two parts. The first chronicles Horowitz's fight against the Establishment as he attempts to publicly argue against reparations to black Americans for the 89 years of slavery that their distant ancestors endured in the United States. The extreme tactics that closed-minded liberals (shouldn't that be an oxymoron?) use to try and silence opinions with which they disagree never ceases to amaze.The second part of the book is a good solid argument against reparations. Many good points are made - beyond the obvious ones of which most people are already aware. I believe that in the end logic will prevail over passion and that the reparations movement will be unsuccessful. Holding people accountable for something that they had no ability to affect sets a very bad precedent and those who create and nurture grievances for their own political gain should be ashamed.
4,Horowitz is unafriad in a politically correct world,"David Horowitz is one of the FEW brave Americans to approach the subject of race. He points out how hyper-sensitive we've become in this politically correct age, and ""knows from whence he speaks"" when approaching this subject matter. Should America ever make it down this erroneous path, we will look back on ""cooler heads"" like Horowitz, and wish we had paid attention. If a Jewish man doesn't know about hatred, who does? America's past is littered with closed-minded bigotry, and here is a man who has turned from the ""intellectually bankrupt"" liberalism of the 60's and ""grown up"". A GREAT read. He makes you think, and that's a REAL writer's job....."
5,Horowitz exposes the truth again,"David Horowitz' new book, Uncivil Wars, does much to debunk the idea of slavery reparations. This is an idea that is gaining momentum, as more and more liberal leaders endorse the idea. Once a fringe proposal, the past few years have seen the idea of reparations become more and more legitimized in the eyes of lawmakers, educators, and the public. Horowitz' exposes the danger of letting such idea come to fruition and why reparations should be demoted back to a fringe oddity.An excellent read which rationally addresses a national nemesis."
1,Disappointing ...,"I just finished this book last week and it was kind of disappointing. As a conservative black man, I was looking for a strong case against minority special rights. Instead, Horowitz came across as mean-spirited and at times even racist. I believe there are arguments to be made against special preference legislation, but I we lose the battle when we elevate our personal hatred of people of color. I almost fealt dirty as Horowitz time after time denegrates the African-American community, not for conduct, but for their actual identity. I began the book hoping for an indictment of liberal philosophy, but left feeling the taint of racist indignation. In order to defeat the Leftist agenda we need to remain objective and not condone the same strategies as used by David Duke and his ilk. I hope Horowitz presents a cleaner message in his next work."
1,Horrible,"I can't imagine anyone who understands (...) reading this and gaining one iota of understanding about thepolitic of reparation. (...)This book is poorly written, with little merit in it'sdebate, and doesn't fairly depict all sides of the argument, in anyway, shape or form.One should not think of drawing any reasonableopinion from this book, since it is written by the same man who waspaid by the Energy Companies to bad mouth California State's endeavorsto get the criminal doings of the energy companies under control."
3,A Glimpse of what is but not what could be,"Mr. Horowitz's account of the challenges that faced him in presenting an opposing point of view on the reparations issues is both insightful and frightening. He documents both sides of the issue with current thoughts of individuals who are in favor and arguments against. He lists a variety of resources to support the debate.It is frightening, in that on many of today's campuses there is little room for intellectual dialogue about the issue. Displaying the ease which one group can intimidate others, creating a tyranny of the minority.What I found lacking though, are possible solutions. Many know the problem exists and this book reenforces that belief, what isn't presented are possible solutions to present both points of view in an intellectual manner."
2,alabama songs of inspiration,"The group Alabama ha always been a favorite of mine. However, this CDis not their best work. I was disappointd in it and expected much more than I heard. I think this is just not their genra."
3,"Bring on da noise! (Well, sort of).","If you kind of like noise music, but are put off by ten minute-long songs that are little more than static and feedback, then stop looking to Japan and look to Australia instead. Shinjuku Filth (and their other band, the similarly-named Shinjuku Thief) hail from Australia, despite the Japanese reference in their name. This album is noisy, but not as hardcore as Merzbow or Dissecting Table. Nor does it have the pointless randomness of The Gerogerigegege or To Live and Shave In L.A. Shinjuku Filth create a more industrial-based noise that I find to be much more listenable than the majority of noise music. It's sample-laden, it's got inhuman screams, and on one particular song (""The Junk"") it's got synth stabs that are reminiscent of Clock DVA's ""The Hacker."" In other words, the songs sound like songs, not like a radio tuned to where there is no station."
4,Excellent all-around board,"Been running this about 6 months with an AMD X2 3800+ -- very low power processor. I bought the board cause I wanted it all -- 4 DIMM slots, firewire, high-quality integrated video with the chance to upgrade to PCI express discrete video later, AM2 socket, and the TV out module was a bonus (that I installed but haven't used yet, but soon will with video editing). No problems of any kind, started with 1 GB DDR2 RAM and the cheapest AMD X2 processor, and the performance of the integrated video is fine with Google Earth and Photoshop. I was upgrading from old AGP 8MB graphics and a celeron 300 processor. I like the board layout and extra firewire back panel connector, and the DVI and analog VGA output is a nice bonus. Recommended for all but serious high-end video users (hard core gamers, I guess)."
4,Fast motherboard with lots of good stuff,"Great motherboard, you will need to buy a seperate riser for the optical out and it does not have that many slots, but it is fast and quite."
5,Great Horror CD with accompanied DVD of videos,"Rob Zombie was the best thing to come out of the 1990's. His mix of industrial rock, horror, art and psychodelica really gave a kick in the ass to rock that was well needed during the GRUNGE decade. Rob Zombie is the new Alice Cooper for the millenium. White Zombie was great, but HELLBILLY DELUX is his musical masterpiece (Devil's Rejects being his movie masterpiece!)...This is a great, great release-musicly and now, visually with a DVD featurung a video clip for EVERY Hellbilly Delux song!!!! A bit pricey, but worth it!!! A great treat to us ZOmbie fans...Hopefully, he'll make a new cd and ALSO releases it with a DVD featuring a video for each song!!! Maybe he'll even do a rerelease like this for sinister urge!!!! What is missing is a dvd concert video, but till then, get this cd/dvd combo..."
4,Pretty good,"Many of the songs by Rob Zombie are included in the Twisted Metal Series games, such as Twisted Metal III and 4"
2,Not What I Expected,"Too freaky, too demonic, too disturbing. I only ordered it so that I could watch Rob Zombie move. He must be the sexiest man alive. If I had been able to download a sample of this product, I would not of ordered it. Perhaps twenty years ago it would have appealed to me."
3,Interesting combination,"Rimsky-Korsakov is one of the great composers of Russian classical music. Sergey Taneyev and Anton Arensky are two lesser-known Russian composers of the early 20th century. All three fall into the Romance school of classical music, as demonstrated in this album. The piece by Taneyev and Arensky are not well known, even among fans of Russian music, even though both are nice pieces of music; better I would say than Rimsky-Korsakov's 3rd symphony. Are three pieces are orchestral pieces with no singing; and all are distinctly Russian in sound; powerful, dramatic and melodic."
4,Great biopic,"Johnny is quite the character! Entertaining video! (however, the sequel, 'Johnny Berlin 2 - Notes from the dumpster' is pretty lame."
2,Not so good!!,"It's just plain not good!! ...At least it is not worth the price. I only wished I could've sampled it at the store before making the purchase. the selections are boring, disc 2 is a bit better than the first one, but still, it didn't meet my expectation. I was so embarrassed (bored) while listening to it with my friends and had to either skip tracks or just stop playing. It says 2003, yet still contain some old tracks (at least they are better). If you are going to play it at a loud work shop or garage, this set of CDs might be okay. Buy it at your own risk!!"
2,I couldn't agree more!,"...It sounds like one of those bad remixes of late '80 early '90.Second disc has a bit more energy in it here and then, but it is boring seeing as a whole concept. The only track which cheered me up a bit on first cd was the Streets. But I'll advise you get the ""Original Pirate Material"" instead... Caution advised!"
5,"Ahhh yes, finally...","In the booklet for Taking Back Sunday's ""Tell All Your Friends,"" it is claimed that Northstar are the greatest band ever. So, that's a little bit of a stretch, but this album is AMAZING. They play a combination of old Saves the Day, Taking Back Sunday, and Brand New, all fused with a little originality. I highly recommend this album based solely on the fact that the vocals are amazing and lyrics are exceptional. Buy it, listen to it...you'll love it."
5,"In a world of excess and self indulgence,","it is great to hear some jazz that focuses on the essential elements, melody and swing. This CD is a great tribute to the guitar tradition. The stripped down instrumentation and the acoustic quality of the recording(No AMPS ALLOWED)leave Steve and his trio no place to hide. They pass that test with flying colors. There is not one track that I don't enjoy and the CD is on the top of my stack. I would suggest this CD to anyone who likes great music. I would be proud to play with the Steve Greene Trio anytime. -Gerry Beaudoin"
2,Don't invest on this one!,"Update (8/04): the one you need is The Collection (SACD Hybrid).Having a great British Invasion CD library starting in Europe, I readily became very interested in this offering. I will not spend time talking about the music because enough has been documented: the Searchers were a GOOD band and underrated in their short time in the limelight. I had a German Teldec (Searchers Hits collection) which unfortunately was underpar. I later obtained which in my opinion was the standard, that is The Searchers Greatest Hits (Rhino 1988). All the great singles are here in TRUE stereo from the first generation tapes. This Castle Music CD is dissapointing. Reviewer Barrycrist is incorrect: only one selection is stereo; the rest are MONO.Summary: pass on this one and go for the Collection."
3,"2-3 STAND OUT SONGS, THE REST LEAVE YOU SEARCHIN'??",THIS CD DID NOT STAND OUT TO ME...MINUS THE MORE POPULAR SONGS....BUT IT IS WORTH THE $$ IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD SEARCHERS FAN??FROM MY SIDE OF THE FENCE:)
5,touching silk,"i like this because it sounds like Asian music and it relaxes me pretty good. there are ten songs on it and most of them are pretty good. if i remember right, towards the last two songs sound like they started making less effort to keep you fascinated with the music, if i remember right that is."
3,It was on sale.,"Package arrived on time. The blades were beautiful, however, they were not as sturdy as I've read in previous comments. One of the blades was offset and crooked. It was on sale, so I guess you get what you pay for? The Masamune was a better investment, IMO."
2,Crooked,"Well for the price, I guess I really ""Get What I paid for"". As soon as I unsheated it, the metal part between the sword and the sheat came off. The blades ar not aligned and very wobbly. The tang is, what can I say about it . . . no tang at all. I bought it for display purpose, but i guess it won't even serve that simple purpose."
2,THE DIFFICULT REMOTE RUINS IT,"To me, picture and audio quality are expected commodities on new standard televisions. It is only the remote that makes the difference. The Toshiba MD14FN1 remote is as difficult to operate as the Japanese language is to read.1) TV functions are secondary and written in an indecipherable watery-orange ink. Difficult! 2) Essential TV functions are crammed together. A total of 27 buttons reside on an area less than 2 x 2 inches. The mute key is lost 4 down and 4 over, while an arcane ""input/select"" is directly under the large power button. Difficult! 3) The Numeric keypad is an after-thought, located 2 down under a quizzically prominent information key. Further, once you find the pad there is no raised #5-key to center your fingers within the 1 x 1 allotted inches. Difficult! 4) AAA batteries? This is the only product in my house that requires them. Difficult!If you can't use the remote why buy the product?"
1,Don't Buy it,After 10 months of use the Television will not turn on. Poor reliability and in 90 days the warranty doesn't cover labor charges. Buy another brand.
1,This lasted less than two years...and died this morning!,"I ordered this in Sept of 2003 and it totally died this morning, less than two years later! No Good stay away. Wish I did."
2,My TV Broke,"After 2 years, my tv broke down. One of the transistors makes a loud hiss. The TV and DVD does not even turn on.When it worked, the picture was not sharp. The images are also distorted. Lines on the football field looked bent."
1,Unreliable and poor warranty,"Less than a year after purchase the DVD eject mechanismbroke, making the DVD player unusable. Also, after 90 daysthe warranty doesn't cover labor charges. Not recommended."
4,Great Vegan Book! But don't look for Traditional Recipes,"Great vegan cookbook!!! Easy recipes, easy to follow, available ingredient especially if you live near an indian grocery. Some recipes are nontraditional but jusy as tasty. Americans don't panick when you see aubergine (eggplant)& courgette (zuchinni) which are readily available. I'm still not a big fan of soy milk. I preferred almond milk which can be used interchangably with the desserts. There isn't an index which is why I only gave it 4 stars. That can be a headache when you need a quick referrence. I repeat alot of recipes are not traditional but they're still tasty. For example: There isn't a recipe for palak paneer (tofu) and the recipe for mattar paneer is ok. The bean and lentil recipes are great!!!"
1,Not worth it.,"I can't say I've looked at this particular title, but I have looked at several others of the enormous number of books that the author has churned out (and made the mistake of buying the Mexican book), and I imagine that this is more of the same. Each book is simply a collection of recipes - often not very good ones - without a single word of explanation or information anywhere. What I can't understand is the popularity they seem to have in Britain. Every other bookshop's vegetarian cookery section is stacked with copies of the various titles. As they cost, if my memory serves me correctly, 5.99, I can only assume people buy them because they're cheap, but I don't think they would be worth having if they were being given away free."
5,A great Death Metal release! (4.5),"I love these guys. This album truly is a jewel. The year of 2006 has so far seemed to be a great year for Death Metal releases.Misery Index have an uncanny ability to keep the momemtum flowing in their songs in places where some Death Metal bands start losing it (most notably the originality area) and thats always a big plus in any Deathheads book! If you miss the days of blast beat heavy Death Metal and are tired of new and unoriginal Death Metal acts then this is for you.If you like this album, then make sure you go pick up SKINLESS'S - TRAMPLE THE WEAK, HURDLE THE DEAD! Its even better than this!"
4,Listen as you drive around,Lead a busy life running from place to place? This is for you. The Supernatural Ways of Royalty in CD! This is the easiest way to benefit from these writers. You will learn that you DO have power and authority along with grace and mercy and that it's time to believe it and have the confidence Father meant for us to have.
4,Necessary Reading,"Kris Vallotton wrote everything in here except for two chapters. Sometimes it is difficult for me to listen to Kris, but it was quite easy to go through his book. It flows quite nicely. This book really made me see myself more as God sees me -- the way I really am. I truly am a high priest and a king in God's kingdom. I am seeing more and more that, as I am not to put any boundries on what God will or will not do, neither should I put limits on what God will do in and through me! This is truly a book that will launch you into your God-given potential."
5,Great Work for a Great Movie Producer,"A work of art! If you are breathing and have plans to keep breathing into old age, you must read this book. We hear the horror stories about nursing homes, but this book gives you the bright side as well. If we could just get those in control to see the impact they have on the elderly, perhaps we could give old folks a better life. I believe this book will go down in history. Someone should write a movie!!!"
5,A book every Christian should read,This is book that will completely transform how you think. I've been a Christian for 12 years and this is the first time I've understood what that really means. It changes everything.
4,Rewriting the way you approach life,"With so many dysfunctional up-bringings in people lives, we don't know how to step into our inheritance. This book challenges some of those inherent notions"
5,I love every book Kris writes,"Kris is so anointed in his writing, his thinking is out of the box! He is so unreligious which make him unique. He is a lover of God and his writing reflects his friendship with his Heavenly Father! I love everything he writes and reread most of his books! If your hungry for relationship with God and tired of religion then this is your man...anything out of Bethel is great!"
5,Helping me on the journey from pauper to princess,"This book has helped me realize my true identity in Christ! It has helped me go from a pauper mentality to a kingdom mentality, one where I know that I am royalty and that I should live my life accordingly!!"
5,AMAZING MUST READ!!,"I just finished reading this book and plan on re-reading it to take notes. This book helped me understand the way God views me and my full potential to bring His kingdom here on earth. To move in the supernatural, to love people as Christ loves you, to be the change the world needs, you must first recognize who you are in Christ. This book helped me do just that. Thank you Kris for writting this book!"
5,Great book,This is a must read for anyone who wants to break free from dead and powerless religion as I do. Don't miss this or Kris's other books.
5,HERE WE GO AGAIN,"It just keeps getting better and better. Tired of religion?? Tired of being powerless?? Want More? Expect More? Than this is for you!! Time to rise up and be revealed as a Son and Daughter of God!! This book will fuel your Holy Ghost fire! No Holy Ghost fire?? You will find it here!!!! AND DON'T FORGET ""When Heaven Invades Earth"" & ""The Supernatural Power of a Transformed Mind"" both by BIll Johnson!!"
5,Contains the keys to Kingdom Living,"This book helped me deal with the thought processes I had in my life that were not lined up with the way a believer in the Kingdom thinks. Anyone who wants to walk in greater favor with God and man needs to read this book. There are so many things that we do that disqualify us from going higher in our destiny in God. Many of these things are directly related to how we think about ourselves and others. This book helps deal with those ways of thinking, and gives us understanding on how we can think the way a person of royalty would think."
5,Mull over every word!,"After reading Kris' book, I had a whole new level of respect and admiration for him as a ""Prince"" of God. His humility and vulnerability to share from his life and God's process of refinement within him released grace and empowerment to me personally to live the life I am really called to live. I've bought and given it as gifts, and recommend you read it and do the same!"
2,okay,"The speaker spoke in kona, HI and was very rude to me.Kept ranting about some prosperity gospel and benny hann being amazing. LOL."
5,The Supernatural Ways of Royalty,A wake up call to the Bride of Christ to step to the next levell...
1,I'm disgusted,"The vast amount of WOF Theology in this book, and the real lack of a Biblical substance really disgusts me.Do any of these authors read their bibles?John[...]"
5,A MUST read!,"In an era where everyone is trying to figure out who they are or ""find"" themselves, The Supernatural Ways of Royalty will open doors in your heart and spirit to release you in your God given identity and purpose. One of the BEST books I've read. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is on a journey of discovery. Thanks Kris!"
5,eye opening,"He shows you where you were all along, seated in heavenly places. After years reading it i still feel the Holy Spirit whisper things to me from that book. awesome stuff!"
4,Must Read,"If you have just recently discovered Bill Johnson & Kris Vallotton, you must get this book. Supernatural Ways of Royalty had a great impact on my life. Great book to start to open you up to the Scriptures pertaining to your priesthood and kingship in Christ Jesus."
1,"DON""T BOTHER","These are a total waste of money. I have a little dog who likes to mark in the house, so I bought the small male dog diaper and these liners from Simple Solutions. The liners are so small that you'd need x-ray vision to get them lined up right when your dog wears the diaper. I don't, so the fabric got wet, and totally defeated the purpose of having liners. I ended up using two at a time just to use them up. I can't imagine what would happen if someone whose dog wears bigger than a small diaper tried to use these. Ugh. My advice? Go on eBay and see how many people are out there making and selling male dog belly wraps that don't need liners. You can get several for the price of one Simple Solution male dog diaper and they're custom made!"
1,Seriously?!?,"I felt like a total idiot when I opened this package. The diaper liners look like regular panty liners you can buy in the feminine hygiene department of any store for $1. I am not really disappointed with the product itself, more so with myself for not realizing this before paying almost $10 dollars for this item."
2,Doesn't hold much,These liners are only good for a small piddling. Anything more than a few drops and your doggie diaper is soaked and needs to be washed and replaced.
1,don't waste your money,These hardly absorb any liquid at all. Much cheaper to buy women's hygiene products at a supermarket and use them for the dog. Don't waste your money on these.
3,Good if all that's needed is small,"These have very little absorbency. They might be OK for small amounts, yet if there is more needed, these are not the right pads."
3,I Liked The Simple Solution Diposable Liners,"The Simple Solution Disposable Liner serves it purpose; however, I find that the unscented, light absorbency, cushion female panty liners can provide same use at a considerably lower cost."
4,Really Thin,I guess I could have bought just reg ladys liners that is what these look like. Shipped fast and product was ok
1,Don't waste your money,"There are problems with these liners because they do not stick to the mesh of the wrap-around diaper. They fall off every easily even when they are dry. You are better off buying cheap panty-liners from your drug store. I got a package of 20+ for $.99 and they adhere much better to the wrap-around diaper mesh and even absorb much better. Panty-liner are the ""simple solution"" you can find. The wrap around diapers are really good but don't bother buying the very expensive Simple Solution Disposable Liners. They are way over priced and not as effective as inexpensive panty liners."
3,Not Compatible with Singapore Voltage and frequency,"I purchased this item with understanding that the voltage and frequency meets Singapore requirement of 230V AC 50Hz.Since it was not mentioned in the specification 120Volt 60Hz, I bought an adapter which converts 230V to 110V. Still the frequency remain unchanged. I contacted Sony, Malaysia where the product was manufactured. They didn't confirm whether the item is compatible for 50Hz and 60Hz.Even though the power consumption is 14W, still the frequency 60Hz may produce lot of heat and my shorten the life span.Hence, verify Voltage and frequency before buying the product.Actually the product is very good, since Amezon did not specify the above mentioned requirement, I felt upset."
2,Nice Design - Poor Execution...,"Brunton has a reputation for excellent products - unfortunately the 8099 Eclipse compass does not meet that reputation. I found it to be very flimsy - a thin plastic design, VERY flexible baseplate, the magnetic needle binds and the mirror/cover does not stay locked at the 45 and 120 degree detents. There are other higher quality compasses in the same price range so I returned this compass for a refund. Too bad - I liked the functionality but the quality just isn't there. Which is a surprise because the other Brunton products I've used were exceptionally high quality..."
2,Disappointed,"The product that arrived was in good condition, but it did take longer than expected to arrive. Also, I ordered the Eclipse Pro Compass which was what was advertised when I purchased this item. However, I received a regular Eclipse Compass instead (big difference as far as special features used professionally). When I tried to resolve this with Amazon, they told me that this was the product listed on the order so there was nothing they could do except issue a refund. I feel that I was mis-lead when I purchased the item and that there was no effort to resolve THAT problem, so I am left with a compass that I cannot use for work and have to go through the process of returning it and ordering a new one. FAITH is LOST!!!!! So beware that what you order may NOT be what you get!!!!!!!!!"
1,terrible,POS.The stop detents won't hold the cover in place at the 45-degree angle. Its like wet spaghetti. Don't bite.
2,Chords,I hoped chords were included - and they were! When you sell music-books online it is an important information!
5,Fosters Songs Always Remembered,"Being truly loyal to my state, I love my state song, which was written by Stephen Foster. ""Old Folks at Home"" is the song of Florida, my home state. Foster gives me a sense of pride in my state. I am an old Southern good ol boy, and I recognize a good ol book. This is one of them."
4,"An entertaining, if short, book","Protector is fairly entertaining. If you're looking for a quick, fun read, or if you want to pursue other Known Space books (especially the Ringworld series), go ahead and pick up Protector. If you're looking for high drama and/or deep characters that you can care for, Protector probably isn't for you. One of the things I like about this book, and other Niven books, for that matter, is that *most* of the science is solid. The descriptions of certain technologies are detailed enough to be intriguing and enjoyable for anyone."
5,The best explanation ever on why it hurts to get old!,"In the Protector Niven explains why we look so horrible and why it hurts to get old. His explanations in this book, has me convinced he must be right. (or he is one hell of a writer :-)). It gives the most facinating explanation of the origin of homo spaiens. This is a must"
3,"Juvenile, but good","If you like epic SciFi with positive endings and colorful characters, which I do, this is a good book. It does suffer from ""simple"" logic though, but sometimes things do work out like that. I do reserve more stars for better writing though."
5,An all-time favorite,"I love this novel. It's stayed with me for years, so I bought it again and it still packs a punch. There is one scene in particular, a doctor is doing a biopsy on a copse and finds a chunk of the yam-like tuber involved inside the corpse's stomach. Beyond temptation, the doctor eats the piece of root while the nurses stand-by aghast. Yuck! But it made the point of how driven by instinct we can be. A lovely thought that the idiocy of mankind is attributable to a stalled adolescent development. An intriguing thought of what it would be like to grow up."
4,Interesting stuff.,"This book is three stories about a species called the Pak, which we're related to, because they're the adult form of plant-transformed homo habilis, though they live on a world near the center of the Galaxy and we don't know about them, that is, didn't until a weird looking spaceship with an alien in it spouting his inpronounceable name, (Phssthpok), came alongside a nice human ore mining ship in the asteroid belt who was just minding his own business and kidnapped the guy inside. The rest of the book springs from this point and is very enjoyable as are all of Niven's works that I've read to date."
1,Protector: Library Edition (Audiobook),"The Protector book is a good book to read, but not listen too. This audiobook implementation of Larry Niven's book exceeds a threshold of spits, clicks, and tits, that any non-ARM prisoner should be forced to listen too. Unfortunately, we are held in the cell while ARM agents cover us with grating irritating noises in our desire to experience the Known Space basics.An errant Protector finds earth and, much to his dismay, fails in either attempt to re-solve a new colony or eliminate a deviate one. Larry Niven integrates the science into the background when it should be and let's the human element guide the story. From the asteroid belts to the earth, we learn why we exist and what our place in the universe was supposed to be.As far as a read, it's clearly a 4, but this Blackstone audiobook only rates a 1."
3,Lame and redundant,"Basically everything you learn in this book about Known Space is already in the Ringworld series, so if you liked Ringworld and wanted to learn more this book isn't what you're looking for. Also the entire plot is summarized rapidly in the Ringworld series, so there are no surprises. And we've seen the climax before, only with Teela Brown instead of Brennan...The book ages poorly too. What was Niven even thinking? Newspapers are audio tapes that you put in a tape player. The Mars base is -inflatable-. Apparently it's feasible to zoom around the solar system in a matter of hours with virtually unlimited fuel."
2,quality is not good...,"My 1 1/2 yr old is half Chinese, so I was very excited about getting this DVD for him. However, I guess I was expecting Baby Einstein type quality, and this is far from that!!! Instead of music playing in the background, there are WIND CHIMES the whole time and it drives my husband and I up the wall. We can hardly watch it! The teaching is pretty good, very simple, which is where you start with little ones, but we can't hardly get past the wind chimes enough to even watch it. I would not buy this if I had it to do over again!"
1,Vivitar 840AF flash for Canon EOS,Unit defective when it arrived. Zoom setting LEDs on back blinked but unit would not flash. I ended up buying a Canon 430ex instead.
5,All Mary Stewart's fiction should be reissused in trade PB,"As in all her other novels of suspense, this one is simply wonderful. The characters are delightful; the scenery exquisitely rendered."
5,Another of Mary Stewart's wonderful books.,Another wonderful book by Mary Stewart that grips the reader and drags him or her into an imaginative world of wonder.
5,Another chance to relive my youth ... better than Reader's Digest,"I read this book for the first time in a Reader's Digest Condensed Book's version and have been hoping ever since to find it in the ""real"" version. Reader's Digest is GREAT ... but one always wonders. As a horse lover, this book particularly appealed to me. A nice, relaxing read. Keeps one engaged; however, there's no horrible, worrisome drama to give one nightmares. A super story. If you don't know anything about Lippizaners and and the Spanish Riding School, may I suggest that you do what I do and Google things in books that you aren't familiar with. I have pretty much given up reading books without my computer at my side. Too much to learn!!! I love looking up places, foods, and etc."
3,"Great flash, but.......",it will easily break where it slides on to attach to the camera. There is no way to reattach the flash to the camera once that little bit of plastic has broken. Needs new design where the flash attaches to the camera.
5,Great - if you know your limitations,"This is a very nice compact flash that is great for travel. I've used one on a Canon EOS Elan body and had very good results. However, you must keep in mind its limitations when considering it. If you're looking for a flash do to weddings or low light events then this is not your flash. With a guide # of 92 it is best used for outdoor fill flash or when you can get close to your subject. Based on the price I think it's a great little flash if you keep in mind what it was intended for."
2,So horrible I had to own it.,"Just a horrible movie with a low budget and poor script. Its akin to a roadside accident, which is why its worth the time for any MST3K'ers."
3,A little silly,"Maybe I'm just not a person who is capable of being a mystery fan, but this book seemed silly to me. I am perfectly willing to suspend my disbelief in most instances, but after the first few chapters, in which there were a couple of bear attacks and a falling jet engine (!) all in the space of one day, I had had it. The writing was fine, and the scenery was really neat, but I certainly didn't see the humor in much of the book that some other readers did. I also couldn't tell why it was even called a mystery until about 120 pages into it, which was frustrating. Perhaps it's best not to make this your first Kate Shugach mystery, because others certainly liked it more than I did."
3,Not her best,"I really did not enjoy this. I like a true mystery, but the mystery seemed to take a backseat to the everyday wacky life in Alaska. The mystery really didn't develop until you were almost through the whole book. I don't think this was one of Stabenow's best. In fact, her last two I have not liked. Her first books were fantastic and kept you on the edge of your seat! This last one was more like she was trying for something that could be an episode from Northern Exposures. I would not really recommend this to anyone wanting to read a good mystery."
5,Breakup,"I stumbled upon the Dana Stabenow books and cannot get enough of them. This has to be my favorite of the Kate Shugak series. I have read this book twice in a month, the humor is fabulous. I wish the book were not only on Kindle but also an audiobook as I would love to hear it interpretted with voice inflections. I could see days of my life in this book."
4,"great classic nwobhm realm,","this is a inspiring cd(more historical)for many people especially for say metallica/megadeth.gives you some insight of there writting and some style but not for everyone.maybe a good place to start listening to DH but possible not there best but it was remastered/rereleased in 87 just in time for metallica to release some more DH covers.I think DH was a vital part of music in their hayday, now ? but I like them some don't."
5,the origin of heavy metal,"if metallica looked up to these guys, that's proof enough that these guys are great"
3,Good album. Too bad it was recorded in 1979...,"Don't get me wrong, ""Behold the Beginning"" is a good album to have been produced 20 years ago. But if you're buying this CD because you heard the Metallica versions first, you could be in for a surprise. The vocals are more melodic and less aggressive than Hetfield's version, and the guitar lines don't hit quite as hard as the ones pumped out by Metallica. The quality of the recordings isn't as high and the album isn't as well balanced as any of the B-sides or Garage Days CDs by Metallica. I recommend ""Behold the Beginning"" for diehard metal fans that like the thinner sounds of early hair bands, but for those of you thrashers seeking a more hostile version, sticking to the Metallica covers would probably keep you happier."
4,An Adventurous and Suspenseful Book,This was a very interesting book. It taught me about all the ruff times the Native Americans went through when the Englishmen moved to North America. The book also showed how badly the Englishmen treated the Native Americans. The Englishmen would give the Indians free supplies just for living on a reservoir. The free supplies they got though were either rotten food or torn disgusting blankets. Many of the Native Americans would rather die fighting than to die on the reservoirs. This led to many battles between the Native Americans and the Englishmen.
5,Trust In Yourself is an excellent book of encouragement.,"Trust in Yourself, written by country/pop superstar Donna Fargo, is an excellent gift book (for yourself or somebody you love) of encouraging thoughts and messages. It is published by Blue Mountain Arts, where Fargo also has a line of uplifting and deeply personal greeting cards called The Donna Fargo Collection."
4,Great Cd,"Seems the Pitchshifter fans are broken into two camps. Fans of the harder industrial tinged band(more like Ministry) pre [URL], and those who became fans of the drum&bass influenced hard rock sound. Unfortunatly for the fans of the old stuff, those days are long gone. However, for fans of the new stuff(which is imho much much better) its a great cd. Better then Deviant, its sound is placed somewhere between that cd and the excellent [URL]. Im hoping eventually they will get the success they definatly deserve."
4,critical college student,"This is the only book that is effective in persuasion on the issue of year-round schooling. The reason for this is because it is not argumentative in any manner and it is passive in its method of persuasion. Gives the reader all of the information necessary to make an informed decision on there opinions, which works in their favor. Another successful method used by this book is that the authors give positive and negative perspectives from teachers, students, and parent who have experienced this method of school scheduling. Also, given the credibility and experience of the authors, the language isn't over powering because they recognize their readers. If a person is looking for a nonbiased account on year-round schooling that is research, not opinion, based then this is the book to read."
1,wrong color delivered.,"The wrong color was delivered, but the seller was very helpful in returning and refunding my money very quickly. I would have taken an exchange, but the color was not in stock. I would do buisness with them again in the future."
5,Perfect little replica,I love these helmets... Im trying to collect every NFL team. I figure if I buy one division a year to limit my self. Im a huge bears fan and I love setting the bears helmet and who ever they are going to beat up above my TV.
1,a spaniard intheworks,A lie !!! not the original. But a great copy. I sold my original for $500. This will have to do. Same content.
5,A lesson on the power of love,"Having first read this book about 35 years ago, I couldn't wait to introduce my two sons to it. Using the intriguing Jupiter moon and Martian colonies as a sci-fi backdrop, Lester Del Rey spins the timeless classic of a boy and his lifelong companion Rex, a ""domestic"" robot. Their adventures from the outreaches of space to their final destination--Earth--are frought with peril but their love for one another is the reason for their tireless perserverence. A flawless tale of adventure and freindship. My boys absolutely loved it!"
1,Order canceled without explanation,"I ordered this item a week ago. A week later I get an email that says the order was canceled. No explanation.If I had a way to rate this process, I'd give it a negative 10. If the vender is out of stock, the page shouldn't be up."
2,Never Again!,"This machine is the worse! It works when it feels like it, but when it does it does play pretty well. All-in-all I wish I had bought something else"
1,Forever 50,"I intended to give this book to my sister for her 50th birthday but didn't. The writings in the book have a very negative feel to them. Now in my fifties, I am seeing my life as something to be celebrated. This book is more for those who are bitter about where they are and what life has done to them.Instead, I bought a book with quotes about love and asked everyone in the party to write something to my sister describing what she means to each of them."
3,Very dated,"This book was not nearly as entertaining as her other books - it was disappointing. The others (""Suddenly Sixty etc."") were more up-to-date than this one, regardless of copyright date. This one shows it's age."
1,Don't buy it,"I was given this toaster oven as a gift after my old toaster oven died & I hate it. I primarily use this appliance as an oven but this one never bakes. Breaded fish tastes soggy like it came out of a microwave not crisp like from an oven & that is cooking it for 10 minutes over the recipe time. Frozen taters that should take 15 minutes at 450 took 25 minutes & still weren't crisp. It definitely cannot be used as a ""small oven"". I am very disappointed and plan to replace it."
1,try another oven,We have owned this at our vacation home for 2 years. It gets so hot it warped our countertop - we now have it on top of a cutting board to insulate the heat. The heat actually discolored the top and it is now concave. Timer and heat control have both broken (were relatively easy to fix). Very poor quality - especially since it only gets used a few weeks a year! If we used it more often I would through it away and buy another.
3,"Good value, but uneven toasting and little heat retention","This toaster oven is a good value overall, but I have two issues with it over my last toaster: 1. It toast more unevenly than my last toaster oven - the back of your toast will be black before the front is brown, which can be overcome to an extent by rotating the bread. 2. It doesn't seem to retain heat very well, so the heating elements must stay on for longer. This might be a waste of electricity, but the effect on your food is that to reheat something you have to use a low heat over a long time. For example, in my old toaster, I could put a few slices of frozen, leftover pizza in and they would be hot in about 12 minutes. In this toaster, if I try that, they will burn because the elements are on most of the time, which toasts rather than reheats. However, if I'm willing to wait 25 minutes, I can lower the heat and the pizza will come out fine. That's why I say it's a good value; it has flaws, but you can overcome them."
2,it can catch on fire!,"I love this oven for its compactness and cute appearance. But beware! The minute dial will turn past ""off"" and the oven will stay on when you think you it is turned off. Sometimes I walk out of the kitchen when I am cooking, but thank God I was in the kitchen, just happened to look inside the toaster and saw flames!! We were seconds away from a big fire. I would not purchase this product, and I plan to contact the company to find out why it has not been recalled."
1,Poorly designed and potentially dangerous.,Ours broke for no apparent reason. Lasted about six months. Super cheaply made. Designed so it could easily be left permanently on until your house burned down seemingly. Does look kind of cute though.
1,Runs Very Hot,"My toaster oven runs very hot, probably 125 to 150 degrees over the thermostat setting. This is an inexpensive oven, and clearly the quality is low. It is a reminder that you get what you pay for."
1,"horrible, horrible toaster - catches on fire","this was a horrible purchase; I have had a toaster oven for over 20 years with no problems (Black & Decker).While visiting my daughter in her new apt., I asked if she'd like a toaster oven. She said sure, I purchased and had it shipped directly to her. Thought the Sunbeam brand was reputable.It has caught fire several times - with no crumbs hanging around the bottom. Of course, by the time I found this out, allotted time to return had expired.I recently moved, and instead of tossing old toaster, cleaned it up and moved it with me - still working like a charm for over 20 years - no fires ever, and sometimes there are a lot of crumbs in the bottom!"
3,dimensions incorrect,"The dimensions shown here are 1,016 x 1,205, x 1,819 inches!! Whoever wrote the description for this product should get no stars at all. But I gave it three stars though I have NOT tested this product."
2,I am Swiss,"As a Swiss I have a vested interest in reading about Switzerland, I was interested in reading about a comprehensive history of Switzerland, starting in prehistoric times., preferably in French. I settled for this book in English.There is a lot of information (and this is great) crammed in this book without care about getting it organized in a understandable fashion. Sentences where the grammar is so poor that you cannot figure out what the subject is from the object. (Is it the Duke such and such who did that to the Counts, or the emperor to the Duke , or someone else?... for example). Who did what to who and exactly why and is it related to this event or another one? ? And this occurs again and again. I gave up half way through. I am going to keep looking."
4,As I remember,"Arrive fairly quickly and not damaged in any way. I enjoyed watching the two shows on the type. I thought at the price, VHS over DVD, I was getting a great deal, didn't realize that it would only have the TWO shows on the type. All-in-all, still a nice purchase and will more than likely purchase at least one more."
5,Beautiful Pen,This is another fine writing instrument from Cross. It looks great and writes smooth. Writing with this pen is also quite comfortable and the chrome shines in your hand. I definitely recommend this product.
3,Not so fancy!!,"not as i expected i thought it would be more attractive, but so far so good for it's price!!u might think of another one little more expensive for a Fancy pen.. :D"
1,Not worth the money!,"This mixer is to basic. If your going to spend your money then spend it right the first time. Look into the BEHRINGER VMX200, NUMARK DXM01, or a Gemini UMX-7. Good luck in your search."
1,Don't buy this seperately,"This mixer is definitely garbage but if you buy the Stanton Spin Cycle Pak, it's adequate for beatmixing and blending. Don't even try to scratch using this though. The crossfader on mine started crackling and bleeding after about 2 weeks. Def. not recommended"
5,A great product!,"This is a great product for the money - a perfect height for any bed with good adjustment levels, even for those people who are very short! Being put to good use already!"
3,A good starting point,"This is a great book for getting your feet wet if you've ever wanted to know more about the Civil War, at least, that's where I was when I picked this book up. It has it's highs and lows, and some of the book feels a bit like filler just to make it a bit longer (the last few lists, especially). But overall it's a great start and introduces a great many ideas, names and places to get you to a good starting spot if you have interest in going further into detail about a certain aspect, place or important figure in the Civil War. I should mention that even the lists that seem to be a bit out of place at the end contain enough interesting information that I never found myself wishing I had skipped over them."
5,History Buff's Guide to he Civil War,Very interesting details on a variety of issues associated with the war. Sufficient details toenable the reader to appreciate and to understand. I have long researched the Civil War yet Idiscovered information that I had not known before. Excellent reference material
3,Falls Short of Expectations,"The book, for me, restates the same tired stipulations of others on the Civil War. There really are reasons for the Civil War other than slavery. Texas was settled not for the perpetuation of slavery, but due to the Mexican government knew its people would never settle the area of Texas, and thus opened it to Anglos to do so. Texans fought Indians, built the area into an agricultural success, and developed trade with America. Then the Mexican government wanted to transplant it's own people to take it over. Texas entered the Union as an understood Slave State, then the U. S. Government declared war on Texas for being such. Sorry, but I am still trying to stay with it, however, I am greatly disappointed."
4,Fun book for Civil War buffs,"Good book for a person who has some knowledge of the Civil War, light weight for the serious student of the War. NOT a good place for the person who knows nothing about the War to start. Most Americans who are under 50 years old know almost nothing about American History, let alone the Civil War. It would be a great companion piece to a more serious book such as McPherson's ""Battle Cry of Freedom""."
3,Not bad introduction to the Civil War,"If you're just getting started studying the Civil War, this is a good book for you. The best part of the book includes the lists for best movies, and best books on the Civil War, as well as the best and worst generals. It's a great way to get started analyzing the Civil War. If you're already knowledgeable about the Civil War, except for the occasional list, most of the stuff you've covered already, or already read, or was already familiar with. I enjoyed the lists of best books, best movies, and best and worst generals, but I learned nothing new from this book."
3,Good synopsis of the Civil War.,"I enjoyed reading this book of lists on the Civil War. I used the Kindle version and all the links etc work fine. There is an active TOC which is great. This is an easy read and a good quick reference. I did not learn anything new nor did I encounter any new analyses or theories about the war. My favorite lists were the 'top ten best and worst generals'. I was surprised to see Hood listed as one of the top ten worst generals. My guess is this book will be very popular for those who just want a quick review of the civil war.If you want an excellent and a meatier introduction to the Civil War I would go with McPherson's ""Battle Cry Freedom""."
5,Learn and apply!,"Evan Dudik is a good friend and colleague. The publication of Strategic Renaissance was a pleasant surprise of good writing, combined with great lessons from history and science, two of my favorite topics of interest. Examples such as the Hammer and Pivot from history provide inspiration and tools for any new or smaller company facing entrenched, consolidated competition. Yet history and past norms can also lull companies into thinking inside-the-box, and so insights such as Opportunity Creation & Exploitation remind us of the rewards of - and processes for - blending creativity and rigor in a well-oiled top management team. Required reading for these change-is-axiomatic times. Learn and apply!"
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this chair for $99 and I expected it to be good for the money. However, not long after assembling it, the bottom cushion becomes very thin, which causes you to feel the hard massaging motors on the bottom."
1,Garbage,It came missing parts and was just a vibrating chair. It had no massage function at all. Big waste.
3,"Not bad, not great.","I got this chair for the office. I sit in it every day....but no longer use the massage features. I really thought it was the most comfortable of a few chairs I tried. The cushion is somewhat cheap, but it's not any worse than any other chairs at this price. The leather isn't too bad either for the price. I paid $150, but as many people know...you can get it much cheaper if you look around and catch a sale. I rated it a 3 out of 5 because I still enjoy sitting in it. I can imagine though, I'll be searching for another chair in another year or two."
4,good service,I like the product quite a lot. Only problem is I'm short and can not get the chair to lower enough to let my feet touch the ground. A small footrest was needed. Arrived quickly and in good condition.
3,Okay Chair,"Pros:The massage functions works great, there are so many different setting for the massage and it has a battery.Cons: Not eneough material to cover the motor esp the bottom seat of the chair, I felt like I was sitting on the motors and really its not comfortable, therefore added an extra cushion on the buttom and it helped."
3,Price - Good Comforts - Not Good,The massaging features of the chair are good but the padding is not enough and its very uncomfortable to sit on that for sometime.
2,Bad buy,"This book did not help at all. Presently, I am preparing for my AP biology examination in 6 days, and I have to say that this book DOES NOT HELP AT ALL.Do NOT buy it : it is just a waste of money. If you want a supplement to CliffsAP Biology, get the Princeton Review one...it is much better. This book is not detailed at all and the practice tests are atrocious. One positive point: the vocabulary lists are helpful (that's why i gave it 2 stars!)."
4,Good quality shirt,This is a good quality shirt with good embroidery. I am not even a Tribe fan! I didnt pay regular price though so my review is skewed. I bought it through The GOld Box at a substantial discount.
4,Junventud en Extasis,I find this book to be a good guide for young people. This book teaches young people to be good to themselves and it's a good moral guide that every person should know about.
1,Terrible!,"La gente que le hizo estupendos reviews a este libro o es gente religiosa o es gente que no tiene muy desarrollada su percepcion de lectura.El libro fue escrito por un tipo muy religioso el cual escribe acerca de una juventud utopica y moralista la cual en nuestro mexico realmente dejo de existir hace 20 años. si este libro hubiera salido en 1970 hubiera estado bien, pero cuando salio a mediados de los 90 la juventud lo rebazo.Me es increible que con tanta y abundante literatura apoyen a basura como esta.Que tristeza."
1,I agree with Alonso Mejia Silva... read his comments!,"This is a silly book for air heads, I read it when I was about 18... and the story was so stupid I couldn't believe a Mexican writer could picture Youth in general to be so stupid... if I am not wrong the story is about a 24 y.o. ""kid"". I got to say though, that it could be a good attempt to guide your ""children""... but you may also offend your ""children"" if you were to give them this book as a gift. Besides Sanchez is so self serving with this books, he thinks he can come and teach us morale... as Wilde said: ""Morality, like art, means drawing a line someplace""."
1,Don't ever buy this book!!!!,"Carlos Cuauhtemoc Sanchez was an instant success like 10 years ago in Mexico, it is the kind of thing every one reads... it is a very poor portrait of what a bunch of right winged empty heads would like to believe that Mexican youth is... Truth is that Mexican young people are very much like the global young person... this book is not about México, it is for persons that don't ever read anything. If you can't read Spanish you are missing the hilarious grammar mistakes made by the supporters of this book, it lacks substance, it is like taking a moral lesson and stretching it to the maximum possible length... it is like ""Being a right winged/Catholic airhead Mexican for dummies"". There are dozens of amazing Mexican books, please, save a few dollars, give them to charity or even burn them to increase greenhouse gases in the environment, all those would be better ways to spending your money."
5,Right on Target,"This book is probably not very popular with most young people, because it tells them the opposite of what they are keen to hear. However, it is also the way to make it to the other side in one piece. We need more books like this. The author is a very couragous man, something few people are these days! The story is simple, but makes more sense than most complicated books I've read. Bravo!"
5,Excellent!!!,"This book does not portray MEXICAN YOUTH!!!! It basically describes how most young people think, many do actually believe life is THIS easy. This is a great book for any teenager to read. I totally recommend it!"
5,Thoroughly excellent adventure/history/autobiography,"This is indeed what the review title says-- A thoroughly excellent adventure/history/autobiography about the very early days in Africa. William Buckley did it all...fighting in The Matabela Wars, elephant hunting for ivory, big game hunting, gold mining, POW in the Boer War ..and he knew everyone else. He arrived in Africa from England in 1890 at the age of 17. Book was written in 1930, after 40 years as a pioneer on the African frontier. Buckley passed away in Africa in 1948. He saw and partipated in the tranformation of a continent. Funny stories, history lived personally, natural history, animal information, high adventure. Great book!They don't make 'em like this any more."
4,Good Old Fashioned Space Opera,"Jack Williamson is one of the most noted Grand Masters of Science Fiction. This is one of his earlier works, and has the unmistakeable feel of the era (Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers). It is very dated, but still a 'ripping good' read.This book introduces one of my favorite characters in all Sci-fi: Gile Habibula - who is loosely based on Falstaff (according the JW himself).Sit back with this book, and enjoy as the Legion legens (John Ulnar, Hal Samdu, and Giles) - fight the evil members of the reactionairy Purple Hall."
3,Super Reader,"Shakespearean space musketeers.Or, Porthos = Falstaff?Anyway, a newly minted Legion of Space officer is sent to a planetary outpost where he finds that elder members of his wealth family support a return to monarchy over democratic science.They plan to do this with the help of an alien invasion, and all that stands between them is John Star, your space princess in control of a super weapon, and her loyal trio of guards from the Legion.Cue exciting adventure of monsters, gliders, aliens, gas, tunnels, superweapons, and the bemoaning of a lack of grog.Pretty entertaining."
3,Planet of Terror,"""Legion of Space"" is a somewhat silly adventure story, first written in 1935, about a small group of space naval officers on a desperate mission through space to a distant planet; if they fail the Earth will fall prey to an invasion by aliens allied with human traitors. Much of it is ridiculous, but the book comes to life when the heroes arrive on the alien planet, which Williamson compellingly depicts, painting for the reader stark images of vast ocean, dense jungle, and cyclopean city, each an otherworldly hell inhabited by horrifying monsters. This sequence, which is genuinely thrilling, earned my forgiveness for the silly space travel stuff and the weird plot holes, and makes the book a worthwhile read.I read the 1967 Pyramid paperback, with the Jack Gaughan cover."
2,Turn your brown spots florescent green!,"I certainly like the idea of this product, and the word ""instant"" had me excited, but it works exactly as well as spraying your yard with food coloring. Yes, it makes the yellow spots green. But unfortunately it's not a shade of green found in nature. The startlingly bright green spots won't bug you for long, however, because once the stuff absorbs into the dead grass, it turns back to being brown within a couple of hours. Not sure if it actually corrects the PH of the ground. I'd think just a good rainfall or watering would dilute the urine enough. If you follow the dog around with the sprayer, it may work phenomenally."
4,Lawn Spot Away,Lawn Spot away is controlling the yellow spots in my yard. With 3 dogs I have many spots. Plus the hot summer sun does not help either!!!!! I use it weekly now to help the problem areas heal and to prevent new areas from getting out of control.
4,Impressive,"The product is great and does exactly what it says - ""covers pet stains"" The product come out of the bottle a little ""greener"" than anticipated, but gives the lawn an attractive appearance. Once you try this product, you will be addicted - so buy the bigger size!!!"
1,Little of no improvement,Product arrived in a timely fashion and packaged well. After several weeks of use...really doesn't work. Followed directions but honestly your money is best spent on alternative products.
1,Neon Green is not natural,"I purchased this product with high hopes, but it does nothing more than color the grass a neon green. Once that washes away, you still have a dead grass patch.Waste of Money."
3,It kinda works,This product will make your yellow spots not as noticeable but didn't help my grass grow back.
2,It's like spraying a bald spot with paint,"It makes the brown spots look slightly better, but we have so many that there isn't enough in the bottle to get them all. You have to spray pretty generously to cover one spot. I don't think I will buy it again. I need to try to get my dog to pee off of the lawn or get a boy dog (kidding). I don't think there is an easy solution."
2,Doesn't really work like the picture,"It's hard to spray evenly and the green color is fake-looking. It does make the grass look better than having big brown spots, but not much!"
3,Leans toward stay at home Moms,I purchased this for my Daughter after she went back to work. It sounded like it would be helpful for working Moms. It started out more pro stay at home Moms and put her off so she never was able to read it all. It just wasn't what she needed to hear when staying at home wasn't an option. There may be good advice somewhere in it for working Moms but it is hard to get to.
2,Didn't think it was worth the money....,Most of this information is already common knowledge for a lot of Moms. I didn't think it was worth the money.
5,Their peak.,"Black album is to Metallica as Icon is to Paradise Lost. Highly recommended, but be prepared to listen to the album over till it clicks with you."
3,alright,"This is a great album. However in order to appreciate it as a whole I have to listen to each son individually.This album just doesn't do it for me when I listen to it as a whole.Embers Fire, True Belief,"
4,A very good album by Paradise Lost,"If this album was a little bit more fast it would have been a masterpiece. The songs are doomy slow gotic atmospheric metal . If you like Drackonian times you would probably like this album too. Personally i like very much Remembrance and True Belief. I have to admit that it is a difficult album = you have to listen to it enough times to like it , but it worth's the time."
3,An overlooked film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, is the story of British soldiers in a Japanese POW camp. It is based on autobiographical material by Laurens van der Post. The film is not very well-known compared to other films of the early 1980's. It has been critically acclaimed and stars well known British rock star, David Bowie. The prison's commander is played by Japanese musucian Ryuichi Sakamoto who also composed the film's score. Sakamoto is best known elsewhere for being a member of the Japanese electro-pop band Yellow Magic Orchestra. His score is very well known and probably more famous than the filmThe DVD has numerous supplements which are informative. Included is a making-of documentary, an archival interview by Laurens van der Post, new interviews with crewmembers and actor/composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, and a theatrical trailer."
4,"Somewhat weird, but powerfully moving film","I saw this film when it was first released and was moved by it. Without being overly graphic, it depicts the brutality of Japanese POW camps and the philosophical disagreement within the Japanese army ranks of how POW's should be treated. I've described this movie, or at least tried to explain it to many people. Now that I have this on DVD, I have been able to show it to them and they begin to understand. What gets people, is the subtlety. The movie has some weird ""story within the story"" flashbacks and some of the things like Japanese spirit superstitions are assumed by the director to be common knowledge. This is what catches viewers by surprise when they find themselves crying at the end of the movie and they can't figure out why. The main story line of Mr. Lawrence and Sgt. Hara, is the classic ""does anything about war make sense"" question. They both are trying to make sense in a senseless world."
5,The best of the classics - worth every penny,"I find the movie sophisticated, simple, and entertaining. The acting in this film is superb by all players. The plot is most sophisticated in implementation. While some do not like the flash back scenes, they do however, give more depth to the main character. I never thought I would ever say David Bowie could act. I've learned to never say never. He is flawless in his performance. The diversity of the film stands alone. The drama is captivating, alluring, and fluid. Anyone that understands the value of valor, honor, and character will enjoy this special jewel. I never get bored of watching this film - that says a lot."
1,NOT A DVD!,The seller of this item failed to tell me (or anyone else) that the disc does NOT play in a standard DVD player and so can only be watched on a computer. I am returning the movie of course!
4,Zen in the Art of Being a POW,"Terribly overlooked film. Can't find much of anything to complain about, except it's not out on DVD. I'd love to add it to my extensive collection of War Films, but, like ""The Beast"", it's far, far more than a War Film."
3,"Just another soul collection, except....","...there are several songs here that I've not been able to find anywhere else (World of Fantasy, I'll Be Sweeter Tomorrow, I Ain't Got to Love Nobody Else and Is It Something That You Got). The sound is fair to good, and the rest of the songs are certainly classics; some of them I probably have in my collection 5 times or more. It was worth it to me to pay the $8 for four songs I didn't have; others may not feel as charitible."
3,Hard to rate...,"This is, as the subject suggests, a hard book to rate. It's a fun light read (5-stars) but it's short, topic is dated (you just need read the sub-title) and if you know nothing about war games, perhaps even hard to get into (1-star).I liked it, I play war games (like this) and the old world view is just fun. I mean, I had one of those little spring worked cannons as a kid. Had I had these rules (this is both a book with story and a game with rules you can play) back then, I'd probably still have it and still be playing with these rules.This is after all a book from another time on a subject not for the electronic generation. It's sunshine, cold tea (or hot tea on a snow swept day) and simpler past times. Like almost anything Victorian, you need to like things Victorian / British / or at least off the beaten trail.Hay, in any case... it's free, it's on your Kindle, just enjoy it!"
1,"Thought it was a ""war game"" book","So I got it, and after twelve pages in, figured ""this was a waste of money"". So I forwarded through the pages, just to have it labeled 100% complete."
4,offbeat but interesting small movie.,"This looks like a low budget version of a classic Russian story. But it has the advantage of a fine cast, interesting story, and assured direction. George Sanders, as ever, is outstanding, and Linda Darnell in her vixen mode, is quite good."
2,Linda Darnell and that's about it,"The story line is classic, but what Russian classic ever had this cast. The accents and portrayals in general are ridiculous, nothing in the film makes you think ""classic"", the casting is questionable except that it got Linda Darnell on screen."
2,Summer Schlock,"This is a genuinely bad movie. The casting is atrocious (e.g. Edward Everett Horton as a Russian Count), and the directing is awful. Oh, did I mention the script? It is the worst part of the film by far. In fact, Summer Storm may become a cult film. I felt especially sorry for Linda Darnell, hopelessly out of her depth in the role of a Russian peasant (flashy makeup and all). How George Sanders must have been amused when receiving his check.Why on earth would this film come out on DVD while so many classics are still unavailable? In any case, stay clear of Summer Smoke. The two stars are for the music and Sanders. Otherwise, this 1944 movie would be included it many lists of the worst films ever made."
2,Don't bother,"I found his work confusing and not well-thought out. Likely due to his Arminian point of view of a Gospel that is all about God's work in saving His own sheep, and contrasting the unbelief of those who do not have the Spirit, who are DEAD. (Hence, his title, Be Alive.) You would be better off reading the Gospel itself, than trying to find coherence in this commentary."
1,Excruciating,"This was assigned to me in grad school in my ""fiction as autobiography"" class. It succeeded in making me angry for a week. I would write more but I don't want to spend any more time on this book."
4,Inexpensive power source,Looks good. Small & light. Seems to work. Started easy. Only one AC outlet and it loosened up first use. I will have to fix it.Otherwise I recommend!
1,Don't buy this item,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon.com. I purchased the same item elsewhere. It won't even start. I have tried 2 of them now and they were both junk. I agree with the other guy, they don't even start. It's a complete waste of money . I also could not get my money refunded."
2,generator,"runs, but leaks gas , and , they had to replace the housing from shipment as it was cracked. overall, a poorly made product."
1,No english subtitles???!!! This sucks for hearing impaired peepz,"I remember when I first got XBOX in 2001 and played Halo and it has no English subtitles and I got real mad and so does rest of my deaf buddies. I returned the game and my deaf friend returned whole thing the system and the game. He got Playstation instead. I stay with Xbox for long time then Halo 2 came then it only have half way english subtitles!!! Arggh!! I got real mad at Microsoft. So I fed up and sold my Xbox and then 360 came and I was hoping Halo 3 would be good enough but it turn out sucks! I fed up and sold Xbox 360 and I have Playstaion 3 and I love it every since. Sony games have subtitles which is good thing for me and my deaf buddies. This movie ""Halo Legends"" does not have english subtitles... nothing new with Microsoft. Bill Gates is really an ......."
4,Great Animation!!,"I love the HALO games, and this adds the the already rich universe. The animation is awesome and I would recommend this to anyone in love with the HALO universe!"
2,MY GRADE: C to C plus.,"I rented this DVD to see if it would get me off the fence in checking out the HALO video games. The first couple of stories by the AI were decent with above average presentation and an interesting history lesson of the world but after that the following episodes dropped drastically in quality.Poor to average animation, canned phrases, melodramatic characters and storylines that were so basic they tasted like a bland cereal. I got about halfway through before I threw up all over the place.ANIMATION: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C to C plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C to C plus."
5,Amazing,This movie is the best movie for a halo fan. There is 7 or 8 episodes from the halo universe. The episodes arent the best cgi all except for the last one.
4,Halo Legends,"This is an interesting conglomeration of stories about the Halo Universe, although it is not what I had anticipated. The style of animation varies from story to story, making each more unique, but it also makes the episodes more isolated from each other. I enjoyed watching all of the 'legends,' some of which are more to informative about the Halo universe, while others (Odd One Out), are more entertaining. This is a good choice for Halo fans, and although it not as useful for viewers who are not particularly interested in the history of the Halo universe, Halo Legends will still provide some entertainment, though more so in the later episodes."
4,Halo legends Review,"Over all this product is well done and I am very happy that I bought it. Halo Legends has eight different episode about 15 minutes each and they have some information that you don't get in the games. Each episode is different in how its set up, some are funny were some are serious while some just explain halo. Bones did a very good job on the videos but I think they could have done it with out ""The Duel"" and made the ""The Package"" the one with Master Chief with the computer animations less cheesy. Over all this is a great product and was worth buying and if you are a halo fan then I recommend this to you. Bones should start making a serious of Master Chief/Halo, That would be awesome!! =P"
1,Boring,I bought this video for my son and he just thinks is so boring. It's just short boring clips.
1,Japanamation Halo? What a joke!,"I love HALO! Particularly the series Red V.S. Blue, which is how HALO should be! This doesn't even look interesting! I got excited when I saw the title and thought it might be the HALO movie that had gone straight to DVD, but I thought that had halted in the process of filming... Oh well, won't waste my $$ on HALO Legends, that's for sure! You want HALO with GOOD graphics, a decent story (at times), and hilarious jokes, check this out!:Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles - The Complete Series Box Set"
5,Good artwork in HD,"There are some corny anime cliches here, but for the most part, it's a worthy addition to the Halo Universe. The best segments are ""Origins 1"" and ""Origins 2"", where you get a vision of the Forerunners. In the game they are supposed to be linked to humans, and here, although it's ambiguous what they looked like under their suits, you can still see that they may have been humanoid. Prototype had some corny parts, but the action scenes were incredible.I agree with another reviewer that an overplayed theme was the ""scacrifice mission"". Irritated how some Spartans die stupid deaths. While some Spartans are supposed to be 'expendable', for the most part, they're supposed pretty much unbeatable. Like one of them said in the ""Halo Reach"" trailer, ""Spartans never die, they just go MIA"" Perhaps they should have more stories where it appears they die, but they're actually still alive, but you have no idea where they are or where they went."
3,"Die hard Halo fans will enjoy, others not so much","A collection of 8 animated tales set within the Halo universe, Halo Legends offers plenty of interesting material and enjoyable action, which should be plenty enough for die hard Halo fans to dig. For others though, not so much. Crafted by some of the top anime creators in the business, Halo Legends' biggest flaw is that the whole affair just feels disjointed, and to put it bluntly, is just underwhelming. However, boasting some nice production values, Halo Legends delivers in terms of its action content (which isn't nearly as violent as the video games that it has been adapted from) and voice acting, but in the end, doesn't flesh out any more of the Halo universe that one doesn't already know. All in all, if you're a Halo fan, by all means check out Halo Legends, but if you aren't, then don't even bother."
3,about 30% great and 70% suck but still worth it. walmart - $19,"I'll start by saying that I am a big and long time fan.. I've played all the games and own/read all the books.I'm also a long time fan of Japanese Anime but mostly the more mature and original titles.My favorite short was ""the package"" and the ""the duel"". Although ""the duel"" was in a watercolor style it made up it's lack of graphic art with a interesting story line. If judged on just these two I would give this nearly 5 stars. Voice acting and action were great in them. The stories were not corny or cheesy like the others.""Origins 1 and 2"" were not great but still pleasant to watch just once.The others were horrible.. They belong in the catagory with all the other generic cheap pumped out anime that seems so common in Japan.Still worth it though and Walmart has this for the same price as well."
2,Ugh,"This was such a let-down. Only the last two stories are anything to write home about. The rest, boring, uninspiring, disappointing."
5,What Should be Done on a Regular Basis,"This DVD give a singular lesson for all those in Microsoft, FOX or Paramount Studios... you CAN take the Halo universe further without spending multiple millions of dollars for a live action movie or series based on the almost never ending HALO universe. Interesting graphics and though I'm not a huge fan of Anime style, it was nice to the Spartans back in action. I say, more, more!! Start a series similar to what Fox has done with Family Guy or American Dad - a weekly dose of Halo, Master Chief and all the back stories (or from the MC's recent internment forward) and give those who enjoy the military sci-fi of that world something weekly to look forward to."
4,Halo meets Japan,"First off, it's Halo, so you know it's good. Just don't expect non-stop gunfights and Jackal killing. Most of the episodes are REALLY weird and steeped with Japanese culture. (Ever seen an elite in a kimono?) I'd say that if you like anime and Halo, then you'll like this. If you like Halo but not anime, I'm not so sure. But I can assure you that everyone will love the last episode! It is AMAZING and my words can't do it justice. I would buy this dvd just for the last episode."
4,Great addition to the Halo universe,"If you love the games, you've read the books, you own the graphics novels, and you still want more... You need this movie!"
4,HALO Blue Ray is excellent,"Really loved how the material on this Blue Ray/DVD fills in the gaps in the HALO story line and history of the conflict with the Covenant and the Flood. The animation is all very high quality, even the stylized chapter featuring the Arbiter and his conflict with the Prophets was well done. The Extras that feature game creators and authors of the books also adds great insight into the HALO universe. Made me want to go back and play through the games again and also looking forward to the new HALO Reach game that's coming out this year. I would recommend it to any fan of the game and/or the books who's looking for more background and insight on Master Chief, the UNSC and the Covenant's ongoing battle."
5,Halo Movie Fix in Animation,If you like me are still a believer that there will one-day be a Peter Jackson produced Halo movie then you should buy this disc. Halo Legends is a collection of animated short stories that cover a broad sampling of the Halo Universe. the Stories are well written and the animation varied inn style and top notch. It's not a the movie we are all still waiting for but it's a much need fix for us Halo junkies till then.
3,mixed bag,"Please note that this is a collection of animated shorts, akin to what the Animatrix DVD is to The Matrix Saga.Overall, the production value of each short is excellent. About half (Origins I+II, Homecoming, The Duel) of the shorts were more lore/canon-heavy than I preferred. The other four shorts were more what I expected (animated alien-shooting action).I'm glad I NetFlix'd this as I didn't really care for half of the content. If you're really into Halo lore, you might enjoy it more. I would recommend reading more of the reviews that describe the individual shorts in detail. Again, as far as animation quality, I was not disappointed. The stories were just not to my subjective taste."
4,Amazing,Halo is one of the best video-games in history. This LEGENDS are a great complemente to this super shoter game. Watch it in High-def and enjoy new adventures. Recommended.
1,Expected a Lot More,"I was really hopeful and as a typical dumb consumer I was sold by the cover and the game history. Right from the start, experience forewarned me that when I get overbearing music and amateurish simplistic graphics that I'm in for a big disappointment. That was reinforced when I started to hear a never ending, line after line, high school sophomore level cliche ridden dialogue. Example for a line: ""The galaxy is vast, it's wonders and beauty are almost unfathomable. But the galaxy also hides dark secrets."" Urghhhh! And, the topping on this miserable experience was a lack-of-story. In fact, more like a jumbled, doesn't make sense, lack-of-story. The fact that Microsoft is involved in producing this movie explains part of the problem. Maybe it was put together by their high school game development school."
1,The only Halo fail,I am a big fan of the halo games but I did not like this movie much at all. It had too much anima which I don't care for. It for the most part was cheaply made. There is one good part with some Spartans kickin ... Butt but that was about 10 min of the movie
2,Halo Legends,"Disappointed in the way these were done. I expected more action in the catoons. Instead I got more of a history lesson. If you make any short stories or movies based on any video game especially one as popular as this, have it just like the game itself to keep ones interest."
2,It doesn't add up to anything,"Halo Legends consists of eight vignettes each done by a different producer. Most of the vignettes are too short to be effective. The style of animation differs between each vignette because each was done by a different producer. It doesn't add up to anything. It's not a complete story and wasn't intended to be.I couldn't see any reason for producing this DVD, nor could I find any merit in it."
2,"Not very good, at all.","There's maybe one or two decent stories, otherwise, the rest are pretty much garbage. The animation is poor and some of the stories are forgettable and goofy. I know one is meant to be as a joke, but it's a waste of space. It should've been on the extras or bonus material, instead of mixed in with the rest. Overall, I was looking for something that would add to the Halo Universe or just bring some new life to Halo. This did neither. I gave it two stars for the two introduction episodes and the last one. And even those weren't THAT great."
2,Two Good Stories,"Short and sweet:I was disappointed on many levels, and evidentally there are more female spartans than male according to the storyline. Only cool thing was the reveiling of how the Arbiter came about, and maybe a few of the much too late CGI scenes. Overall, rent if you MUST see it."
2,Only for halo completionists,"I was very hyped about watching the animated shorts, had seen a few on xbox live and was relatively impressed. then i rented this and was thoroughly dissapointed. i think i only liked 3 stories of the 10? some are really good (the babysitter, probably the best) and some were truly awful (the dbz one is the one that comes to mind) it's a good rental but don't waste your money, doesn't expand the universe very much other than giving the forerunners story. the rest are just mediocre at best. don't waste your money on this product. i'd maybe pay $10 at most. it's just not that good."
3,meh...,"All the episodes are decent...but they don't really expand the Halo storyline nor do I have a desire to watch them again. It's worth renting, but if you want more information on the Halo universe...read any/all of the Halo novels, they are well worth the cost."
1,Halo fans will hate this,"I was immensely excited when I first saw that this was coming out. I thought cool an anime that will fill in some of the gaps in the Halo universe. I was completely wrong. This is nothing but garbage and stupidity. None of the character act like they should and it is all just silly and annoying. I rarely do no finish things that I start, but this was so bad that I could not even make it half way through.Then there is the matter of the graphics. This movie looks terrible as if it were drawn by a three year old.In short there is nothing for anyone in this movie."
