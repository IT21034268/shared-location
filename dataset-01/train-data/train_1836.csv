2,Cheap but Not Reliable,I bought a 120 GB last April. It broke last Dec. My data was gone when I returned it for replacement. Last week the replaced drive broke too. It was out of warranty and I had to pay for repariment.
2,Most noicy Hard Drive,"I have bought a Maxtor 120gb HD with 8mb cache and 7,200 rpm, and I must say it was biggest mistake. The drive seems to work fine, exept for the loud annoying noice it makes, I don't understand how they can write on the box ""new improved motor"" when the new one makes even more noice. Though I have worked with their 40gigers and those I'm actually impressed with to be quiet. But don't trust their HDs with over 100gb as they be makin worse noice in ur case."
1,These are horrible.,"These labels look horrible on anything but white paper. If you print a label and put it on a darker background, they look so dark that they aren't usable. The problem is they are translucent so they only work on white paper. What's the point of the clear label paper then? What a waste of money."
1,smears everywhere,"Be careful with these, because the ink will NOT stay on! It smears very easily, and is definitely NOT waterproof! It washes off right away. I even tried coating it with water-resistant spray, and it still didn't work. Such a disappointment."
2,Smearing problem,"Ok, yeah it isn't as clear as you would think. But I feel the bigger problem it smears by the touch of a finger. I waited the next day for it to be dry; still smears! I am trying to figure out a way to seal it from smearing by mode podge or acrylic clear spray paint might help."
4,Perfect for what I needed,"I found these at Walmart and decided to try them for a scrapbook project I was working on. They worked great! While they aren't really clear, the matt finish made my stickers look like stamps rather than stickers on my project. The only thing I don't like is that printing on the paper more than once was difficult. I will be getting more though!"
2,"Not truly a ""clear"" sticker sheet","I was disappointed to find that this sticker sheet is not truly clear. It has a mat finish that is like looking through frosted glass.Also, the backing paper that is on the back of this product, causes lines to remain on your sheet once you've printed. When you apply the sticker to your item, you can still see the lines on the product you've applied it to, even after smoothing it out as best you can.If you are using this product for printing photos on, you definitely want a crystal clear sticker sheet. I eventually found one that offered a truly clear sheet. Try going to: [...]. Item# CLPL26-1-1R is an 8 1/2"" x 11"" page crystal clear sticker sheet."
2,"Not very transparent, not very durable.","I guess it's as good as you'll get for inkjet clear paper, but it's still not good enough.The paper has a rough surface to get the ink to stick, which means the transparent part doesn't look very transparent.Also inkjet ink will smear off it even by touching with oily fingers.The only way to get high quality clear sticker sheets is to print laser onto Papilio sticker paper. I don't think anyone on amazon sells it though."
2,Definitely NOT clear,"I bought this to put on a glass hurricane vase for a memorial candle. It was NOT clear at all, but more like a fuzzy, hazy translucent white. I put the sticker on the candle itself (being white), and it loooks great. My biggest problem is (and the reason I only gave 2 stars)that it is stated as clear, and it is most certainly not. Other than that, it does do it's assigned purpose, but I would only use this on white items so it blends without being obvious."
4,Not perfect but works well,"I bought 3 of these several years ago. Two have a different type of handle and have a small gap when closed (as described by other reviewers) - so it is not perfect. But, it the gap is not enough for dust/bugs to enter (I keep mine in the attic) and no ornaments can fall from such a small gap. The case does not hold near the number of ornaments advertised, but it does have adjustability of rows so all sizes of ornaments can be accommodated. I have not found anything close to this item for good storage of precious ornaments. It surely is better than ""protection"" by cardboard. I recommend this item and plan to buy more for myself and for my daughters-in-law as gifts."
5,Works Great for Me,I bought 4 of these about 5 years ago and love them. Mine are heavyweight plastic and have a different handle design than pictured. I store larger Hallmark ornaments in them and get MANY ornaments in the box. Have never had any problems but I do store them indoors. Maybe the newer cases are made to a different standard but mine work great. They were shipped promptly and double boxed so they arrived in perfect condition.
2,Not so great ornament box,"TO start, it came with a crack on the handle. Though it does hold all ornaments in one neat place, the sides of the box are wedged open by the width of the ornaments (Even though my ornaments are regular sizes). I had to tie the top handle with a bow, to reassure it from opening up. NOT SO GREAT OF A PRODUCT."
3,Not as Quick or Easy,"The product is an older software. In order to be able to view the instructions on howto use the software. I had to download a file from Microsoft because they don,t includethis with windows vista. Other than that its ok."
4,Great for Home or Sunday School,"Children ages two to eight will love this new book from Candle Books. Along with an accurate retelling of the story of Noah and the Ark, the book contains several re-usable stickers and an extra large wall poster depicting Noah's Ark.Noted author and bible scholar Tim Dowley gives readers a detailed account of this Old Testament story, but the real fun of this product will be the stickers, which your children will love. The illustrations are bold and fun and the stickers can be placed, moved, removed and ""restuck"" many times.Children will enjoy learning about Noah and reinforcing the concepts they've learned while interacting with the stickers and poster. The oversized poster would also be excellent for classroom or Sunday School use by any teacher wanting to share this Old Testament classic."
4,Persian Literature,"The book is a usuful source for not only Persian literature, but also for a brief history of Iran."
2,Missing something important,The one very large flaw with this CD is the lack of any (English) translation to any of the songs.What an oversight!The songs are sung with such feeling it's hard not to be hugely curious.Pity.
4,Madcap live concert by all-star gypsy band,"Perhaps you're like me -- when it comes to gypsy music, you can pretty much take it or leave it. However, this is an interesting live album, because of the band's fluidity and playfulness, as well as its lightning-quick timing and tight arrangements. A carnival atmosphere prevails, as they zip through a remarkable mix of styles -- Arabic, Mediterranean, Slavic and Jewish music collide in a high-speed multi-culti chase. After a while this wore me down the way all gypsy records seem to, but for a while I was pretty entertained. Worth checking out."
4,Truth is stranger (and often better) than fiction,"This is a novel about the late great tormented jazz saxophonist Jackson Payne, and the musicologist who is doing research for his biography. Like its main character, the novel is fascinating, frustrating, and challenging due to its unconventional structure that makes it difficult to always know for sure which character is speaking. If you have not already read the best biographies of real life ""tormented"" jazz artists like Parker, Powell, Pepper, Getz, Evans, Monk, Bix, etc., start with those before reading any jazz fiction. The biographies are invariably more interesting and rewarding. All the novels pale in comparison, but you'll be better able to appreciate and understand them if you have read about the jazz musicians who inspired these fiction writers in the first place. ""The Best of Jackson Payne"" is one of the better ones."
4,!!!!,This has a lot of great scenes and monologues for female actors. The writing is terrific. I really enjoy it.
4,Great Primer,"This book is great! It could use a cassette tape to help with pronounciations. But, if you have an interest in Yoruba religion and Lukumi, this book is helpful."
4,Excellent Starting tool,"I think this is an excellent book and cassette tape series. It's got lot to use and the structure is good. I think its easier to use in a group than as an individual though. It moves quickly and having a buddy to help out seems to make sense.Remember it comes with 3Cassette Tapes, which feature 7 learning sections. Don't pay full price unless the tapes are included!I have seen people exploiting their rarity by trying to sell them at outrageous prices. Shop around. Don't pay more than $30 for wonderful resource."
2,Not worth it,This stage play has a plot with a hidden message. The acting was so bad I actually thought they were trying to be bad actors. I was in the mood to be entertained and was very disappointed. The possible problem with this play was low budget. If I had seen it in person I might have a different opinion. I will not recommend this to anyone...not even an enemy.
4,My Daugther Loves it!!!!!!!!!!!,My daugther enjoy the doll and love doing her hair and creating various style. I like it because the doll was very compact and durable to travel with.
2,Not too pleased,The Barbie Styling Head was not as durable as I had hoped. It was smaller in size than what I was anticipating. My two-year old doesn't play with it because it doesn't stay up on the table because of the light weight to it. I have seen bigger dolls for combing hair and this one was not in that league.
3,Not recommended---same info available free elsewhere,"Before purchasing, be aware that this slender, sturdy, and attractive hardback book has only paintings of the chicken breeds, not photos, and very brief descriptions. The same information and comparable paintings are available at no cost in the beautifully illustrated Murray McMurray Hatchery catalog each year-- request a free catalog and you'll have most of the same information as well as a way to purchase the breeds you read about! The Oklahoma State University poultry website and other sites also have this info."
4,"Not what I'd hoped for, unfortunately","The book has lovely illustrations, but I was hoping for actual photos because chickens in someone's backyard flock or at a show often look very different from drawings. A few of the illustrations were shaded with colors not normally found in nature, too, making it hard to tell what color the chickens really were.Otherwise, the drawings are very nice and the book is very informative on the 60 breeds mentioned."
2,Not for anyone wanting information on chickens as pets. Great for history of various breeds.,"Book good for pictures and history of various breeds of chickens. No information about personalities,health, laying ability etc. It is useless for someone wanting information on chickens as pets."
2,Not what I was imagining,"I guess I was looking for a little more in-depth information about individual breeds. Instead, this book describes useless information like the angle of the tail of a specific breed. It really is a ""field guide"" for someone who might be observing chickens in the wild. The thing is, how often are chickens roaming around in the wild?If you are looking for information about breed temperaments, egg-laying abilities, compatibility with other breeds, or great photos, look elsewhere--You won't find it in this book."
5,"Awesome, a must for any rock-n-roll or heavy guitar fan!!","The ""Whackmaster Ted"" rocks on stage and off, from someone who has followed his career for years. A must-have addition to any complete music showcase. Keep it up Ted, If they don't like it, put em in the ""Stranglehold"" baby!"
4,It's actually good!!!!,this isn't a bad nor great album. It's ok. it's better than what nacho cano has been releasing lately and as well what ana torroja has been releasing lately as well.highlights are songs such as Y ahora tengo novio where he defies sexual boundaries and Che Fidel.
3,Response to opposite ends of my experience,This review is solely based on the product and transaction and not the actual story. The product itself is made of a glossed cover but fairly cheap feeling paper. I was a little disappointed with this as other comics I've gotten on here having better quality than this book. The delivery time was spot on and I appreciated that. Unfortunately the product I received was defective and with 2 days of delivery with perfect care taken with the book the binding fell off. That being said Amazon fully refunded my purchase in a succinct and fast method. All in all Amazon gave me the best of a bad situation with a product that contains a good story but quality wise is only decent
3,"Good, but not as good","This ""reboot"" started off great, but lost ground quickly. Geoff Jones is great with characterization but doesn't know how to pace a plot, so the stories just seem to bounce around -- even more so in this case because this contains one of those annoying crossover plots where you always feel like you're missing something."
4,This is one you want.,"This is an enjoyable volume. Fans, longtime and otherwise, of the Legion of Super-Heroes, will appreciate their appearance here. Good story, good art, good reading experience."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Robin has to deal with the loss of his father, and the Titans have even bigger problems.The newly deadly Doctor Light and his recovered memories would like to make Speedy an ex-Speedy.They also end up confronting future selves that have gone on to be not very nice fascists, and not even well meaning ones, really."
5,Priceless,"Another phenomenal book I borrowed from the Uni library 10 years ago, when I should have been borrowing boring stuff on Sociology, that I bought from Amazon anyway a couple of years ago.The only thing that needs to be said about this book is that no-one knows Schubert and sings Schubert like Dieterich Fischer-Dieskau, so when he speaks on him, we should listen. To truly understand Schubert, you have to listen to his lieder. To truly hear his lieder, you have to listen to Fischer-Dieskau and Gerald Moore. To truly understand Schubert, you have to read Fischer-Dieskau's little book. 'nuf said.I don't know if it's required reading in Conservatory's around the world when studying Schubert or songs in general, but it should be."
5,An excellent book.,"I loved the book Dinosaurs because it tells me so much about dinosaurs and it is interesting at the same time. It was fun to read. It was written as if by Jack and Annie and I really liked the part where Annie pretended to be a ""silly-sourus"". I look forward to reading more Mary Pope Osborne Research Guides."
2,Didnt work for me,"i tried to use this for heavier dinner chairs on carpet. I wanted to just be able to slide chairs in and out when having dinner, however these did not make the chairs slide. Glad this wasnt so expensive becuase it was a waste of money."
2,Scratches,"We purchased these in hopes that our new wood floors would not be scratched by our chairs. Although it has helped a little, we have noticed several more scratches which we had hoped would be prevented by purchasing these."
4,Dampens the Sound from Chairs,I need sliders that were under 1 inch and these fit the bill. It is very small and discrete under the chair legs.This slider reduced the sound from my wooden chairs to 50%. Not the best but definitely a lot better. They still make some sounds but I can live with that for the price.You need to drill some pilot holes for these screws so they install better. Ask a friend with a drill to help you out.I used these for tile floors.
2,Scratched our wood floors worse than nothing,"I got these to put on our dining room chairs to replace the sticky felt pads that kept coming off. I didn't particularly care about whether they were ""slidy"" or ""grippy"", just that they would protected our hardwood floors and be more secure than adhesive.Anyway, the part that makes contact with the floor is a hard plastic and it's been scratching the floors even worse than the bare chair leg. Fortunately I'd only installed them on one chair as a test, so I didn't have too much work to remove it.If you have a very hard floor like tile or something these might work, but they're definitely not good for wood. I do like that you can permanently attach them with the included screws and not worry about them coming off."
4,pretty good,"So far, these are doing a really good job. My floors think these are really good. They're quiet & make the chairs glide easily."
3,works only if you use the screws,I used the screws to attach these to chairs and in one case I used the glue they come with. The glue did not hold so if you do buy this make sure you can screw them into the leg.
4,Track List (and CD Identity Question),"I don't see the difference between this CD and the one identified as ASIN B000N23QLK). I'd select based on price. My CD has the numbers R812-06 and A231243.My track lists:Disc 1:1. The Dock of the Bay - Otis Redding2. Turn Turn Turn - Byrds3. Monday, Monday - Mamas & Papas4. Daydream - Lovin' Spoonful5. San Francisco - Scott McKenzie6. Get Together - Youngbloods7. You Were on My Mind - We Five8. A Beautiful Morning - Rascals9. Abraham, Martin and John - Dion10. Both Sides Now - Judy Collins11.

Early Morning Rain - Gordon Lightfoot12. To Ramona - Bob Dylan"
1,waste of time,"The conclusion drawn from the research run by Davis/Brewer, that electronic communication has both attributes of oral and written language is irrelevant, I guess, for most of today's electronic communication. The experiment performed by Davis/Brewer was in my opinion artificial (has anyone heard about mainframe software conferencing VAXNotes??) and has hardly anything to do with the way we use email / chatrooms / blogs, which were not yet there at that time (around 1990).Therefore, I find this book's title overhyped and misleading, the content being far from issues of computer mediated communication and virtuality. On the positive side, authors have sound knowledge of today's linguistic theories. It is only hardcore linguists, who may somehow profit from this book. Anyone else should get an excellent Sherry Turkle's ""Life on the Screen"" instead."
4,VERY GOOD FOR PRACTIONERS IN USG IN O&G,"it's been very usefull in my everyday use of my USG set, and very helpfull in making diagnosis in my private clinic. Thank for the authors for being too much specific in what they mean. I recommend this book for who is searching a very usefull manual for understanding and paracticising the USG in their private use Jair Barbosa - Brasil"
5,ONE OF THE GREAT NANCY DREW MYSTERIES!,"THE CLUE OF THE DANCING PUPPET was a very fun book to read. I couldn't put it down. Nancy is asked to investigate again; this time she checks out a puppet that is seen dancing across the lawn of an old estate, home of an acting group. She follows the puppet but doesn't get anywhere the first time. Ned, Burt and Dave make an appearance as well as Bess and George. Nancy acts in a play, which makes Ned kind of mad. This is a great book for any major (or not-so-major) Nancy Drew fan to read. You are sure to love it!"
1,Stupid Title Stupid Movie,"Don't waste your money. Poorly done, self indulgent shallow invasion of ex wife's privacy. Easy to see why she never would have been satisfied being with him. She brought color and energy to his life and to his family, but obviously got very little back that she needed. The movie could have been an interesting journey of his discovery of himself, but the film maker was unable to bring depth, insight, or emotion to his experience."
5,Jayce's Turbo Powered Adventures Begin!,"This is the first volume in the cartoon series featuring Jayce and and the Wheeled Warriors. The saga begins when Jayce learns of his father's plans to end hunger in the galaxy. But a freak burst of radiation has turned the food crop into Monster Minds - slithering bands of destruction!Episode titles are: ""Escape From the Garden"" and ""Ghostship."""
2,Simon being forced into the wrong mold,"I bought this CD hoping that I would find some early Paul Simon songs, that is, songs he actually wrote. Unfortunately, there's only ONE of those on this CD and it's not very good. These are all demos cut between 1959-1961 where Simon seems to have been desperate to break into the schlocky teen-rock world. The songs range from the mediocre to the downright embarrassing, even though a few were written by successful songwriters (Hal David/Sherman Edwards). Can you believe a song with words set to the ""Skater's Waltz,"" or one about an ""oriental genie"" who helps the singer score with a girl named Lulu? That's the kind of tripe that you'll be subject to in this collection. Even the one duet with Art Garfunkel (which has a hint of the current folk style) can't rescue this dud."
1,Is this for real??,"Suffice it to say i was extremely disappointed. There is nothing here but 'happy daze' hocum. Does simon need the money or something to let this stuff out?? The only thing i can see about this is that its so opposite of what simon became that i suspect a journey to the crossroads, ha, ha. I was tempted to throw it in the garbage but i kept it to show how bad some of my heroes were at some point in time like those you tubes of john lennon totally zonked and dylan throwing a tantrum. I find the lyrics no better than sophomoronic and the singing just fifties schlock. I mean did this guy have a hammer fall on his head like mama cass and then suddenly realize he was not a high school nerd??? Those background backup whatever vocal singers should have been paid not to sing!!! This is just totally bad and simon should have kept this in the closet. Steve"
3,What is everyone thinking!? Read this review before buying,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste."
5,A Beautiful Performance Of Italian Renaissance Music!,"Ever fall in love with great music? I enjoy early(Medieval/Renaissance)works, and the first time I listened tothis disc, performed by the Tragicomedia ensemble, I had to add it to my growing library. They perform the sweetest viol(string) works of the sixteenth century period, very relaxing, equal if not surpassing The King's Noyse ensemble(although they are wonderful in their own performances(with sorprano Ellen Hargis),and arrangments. Tragicomedia is a very special ensemble to be sure in the world of Early Music, and I rate them five, if not six stars!"
3,Worthwhile Purchace for Dylan Fans,"I got this album for one of Bob's best songs, ""Every Grain of Sand"". The rest of the album is uneven. Not Bob's finest moment as a singer - a little too nasal and whiney. Still, there is enough good material here to please most Dylan fans, and Bob's expressions of faith are truly moving."
2,she sounds like R2D2,"Shakira is a fine dancer, and of course, she's pretty hot. The basic problem is that her singing is awful. In fact, to me she sounds pretty robotic - not unlike R2D2 from Star Wars. She should stop singing and stick to what she does best, namely dancing around like a horny, oversexed seductress."
1,What you say?,"I have subtitles when Shakira sings and it still doesnt make sense. She has a nice voice but the rest of her fall flat. Her dancing doesnt impress me, hell every female out there today can dance. She really doesnt make me want to speak spanish either."
4,"Not the best of Shaki's, but anyway it ROCKS!","Not the best of Shaki's, but anyway it ROCKS! The lyric is interesting, the rhythm makes people want to dance.Looking forward to what Shaki will give us in her oncoming concert."
4,"Not the best remake, but still good :-l","It's such a catchy song, I'm not surprised that someone remade it. Shakira does this cover fairly well, with one of the original singers (Wyclef did this song in a slightly different way with Claudette Ortiz). It's a little faster and just as catchy - a real ear worm. I like her vocals in it; he sounds just the same as the original, but I don't like the change in some of the lyrics.Overall, it's a good ear worm that doesn't let go easily. You'll be singing and bopping along to it because it's fairly infectious."
3,POOR SINGLE!!! COOL SONG!!,What a poor tracklist though I considered it's worth it the pay to get the song on the re-released it's totally shame to see how record companies don't comissionate more remixes or dance tracks to try to save money. Hips Don't Lie should have remixes and I know there's one but here's no one. Dreams For Plans is a nice song but hey... I got the album isn't it?! So why I'd like to get a single like this. Better keep improoving and why didn't they put a live track out of any Shakira's performance or even a remixes of previous hit singles like La Tortura or even from her previous hits on Laundry Service.
1,Title track lyrics are from the mind of a juvenile.,"I try to judge music for its musical qualities, but when I heard the song ""Hips Dont Lie"" at a party this weekend, I just couldn't ignore the atrocious lyrics.It's almost entirely Wyclef Jean (or whatever his name is) who ruins Shakira's tune--shooting his mouth off about refugees ""running the seas 'cause they own their own boats"" and other absurd ideas.Together, they can't seem to decide whether the song is about sexy body movements or the American government. It's so stupid, it's an embarassment to hear...As if that wasn't pathetic enough, the abundance of self-referential lines out of these two is just another pronounced example of the overcommericialization of music. The industry wants to sell the product of Shakira, not just her music, so her name is repeated over and over in the song, like some crass hip-hop performance."
5,Quality never gets old!,"While not a film for everyone, Venus has enough to satisfy even the most hardened film buff. Peter O'Toole delivers a stellar performance not because of over-acting but becase of restraint. Even more importantly, he allows a young actress an opportunity to not only rvial his quality but to spar with him at a level rarely seem in modern cinema.Many people will never bother to see Venus. It will be their loss."
3,It could've been a classic....,"I really liked this movie, dispite the unnecessary vulgar language. If not for that, I would've rated this movie much higher and purchased it for my collection. I compare it to ""Lolita"" in many ways. If you can get past the filthy and offensive language, watch and enjoy this movie."
3,Fresh perspective on the tragedy of growing old - but the depiction of women is troubling,"""Venus"" explores the strange relationship between an aging actor (Peter O'Toole) and a ""lost"" young lady, newly arrived in London. They both ""need"" each other in their own way. The story is both an unsettling male fantasy and a fresh meditation on the tragedy of growing old. O'Toole is brilliant as the old man - but one can't help feeling somewhat troubled by the rather degrading depiction of the young lady in this film."
5,Peter O'Toole manages another stellar performance,"I admit that I'm a huge fan of Peter O'Toole. The man can be totally irreverent, cheeky but...I admire his willingness to take chances and push the envelope.Having recently watched his performance in Lassie (also recommended), I was reminded of his versatility when I saw Venus. Instead of a dog lover, this time O'Toole plays the role of an elderly man, still searching for love and beauty. He doesn't even try to cover up his genuinely wrinkly face and allows age to work to his advantage, not always easy to pull off in a film performance.He plays Maurice, a genuine character, who is drawn to a friend's niece and somehow manages to turn this attraction into a drama mixing humor, pathos and downright awkwardness - and yet it somehow all works.For O'Toole fans, I'd also recommend:LassieLawrence of Arabia (Single Disc Edition) [Region 99]"
2,Venus-Peter O'Toole as a Dirty Old Man Out of Control,I think I can be brief with this review as I don't wish to spend too much time or emotion over it. The story is a pathetic romp through the mud and I can't believe that O'Toole would permit himself to portray a dirty old man in heat.Those of you who are long time fans of O'Toole would probably do well to avoid this film as I have been an admirer of his work for my entire life and felt badly for him after viewing it.Those Amazon reviewers awarding 3 stars or less to this movie agree with me and I don't give a dam what Hollywood said about this film.
2,Peter O'Toole as The Perv,"I had heard rave reviews about this movie...why, I don't know. I sat through *almost* all of it (I think I missed the last 20 minutes or so but it was all I could take!). Wow, what an awful movie. Peter O'Toole plays a dirty old man who lusts after his buddy's young niece (she's young enough to be his granddaughter). The whole thing left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Yuck!"
1,Disgusting!,If you like a movie with a dirty old man desiring a young woman that could be his great grandaughter then watch this movie. It is disturbing to me. I didnt enjoy it at all. He was always trying to steal of peek of her naked. I think I just threw up in my mouth...
1,poor quality video bad lighting for professuonal dvd!! a waste of money,A total waste of money. Old dark video with very bad production values. I saw the Miami Ballet version on PBs. This wasn't even close.
5,5 Stars is not enough!,"The first book by Stacy Erin Meyers is a must own! The wonderful and delightful story will please anyone from age 1 to 100 (or older). The illustrations are exceptional! They will keep you turning the pages forward and backward alone, just to keep looking at the wonderful artwork."
1,Where's the truth,"I see Scotie is up to her old tricks of writting again. As in her first book the Cheater she did not check out her facts, there is more to writting a good book than just reading the trial transcripst and the news articles. Scottie did you interview the ""family members"" I would say not, just like you didn't do in the Cheater. I incourge all serioues readers to not buy this womans books, anyone can read news clippings and write a so called book. I can't beleve someone would publish this."
1,Refunded as not in stock,"The shirt is out of stock. I was hoping to receive that, in time for Christmas, for my son.How can I rate it if I did not receive it?"
4,Much taller than described!,"This is more of a green, leggy with intricate foliage (think top of carrots)plant with sporadic flowers. Mine grew well over 4 feet and I cut them back to see if they would bloom more. They look pretty goofy in front of my townhouse. They would be perfect along a fence in a spacious back yard. Definitely hardy and easy to grow!"
5,clean cutter,Chain fits my saw perfectly. Very sharp from factory and cuts like a charm. My local shop guys loves the manufacturer.
1,Poulan replacement chain,"This chainsaw chain does not fit all Poulan 16"" chainsaws! However, there is no way to know this from the information available here on Amazon. This chain will fit some Poulan models but will not fit a lot of other models. I'm sure this is a good quality chain but until Oregon provides more compatibility information I'd stay away from their brand."
3,"Doesn't fit Poulan 16"" bar.","Maybe I'm missing something, but it says it works with Poulan and it's 16"" but it DOES NOT fit my Poulan 16"" bar. It's too long. I've returned it and am trying a different length."
1,Breathies are made in China,"These used to be the only treats my dog would eat. He loved them, and would not eat anything else. I saw a news report about the FDA warning on china imported jerky treats, and thought no way could that be reason my dog has been having health problems, they sell them at Whole Foods and advertise the chicken as organic and free-range, words which just aren't used in china imported meat. I took a close look, and there it is, made in china in TINY print. I stopped feeding them and slowly my dog has stopped throwing up all the time, has his energy back, and just obviously is feeling like himself again. Please don't play roulette with your dogs life. Check all packaging closely, and tell this company to stop importing from china! Dogswell, btw, will not respond, and has banned and blocked and deleted my inquiries on their facebook page. They do not care about your or my dogs health."
5,No more doggie BAD breath :),I am in the process of ordering Breathies Chicken Breast Strip for the second time. My Tea cup poodle Lucy suffers from a mild case of Hypogycemia and also had breath that could peel paint off the walls. This product has been a life saver. I give Lucy one in the morning and one in the evening. After a week of use her breath is fine and I believe this product helps keep her blood sugar level in check. It gives her a treat that is a good source of protien without a sugar spike. I have tried all the green treats and flavored bones and nothing helped Lucy's breath like Breathies. I am a costomer for life now. Katie CNew Jersey
2,Made in China - off to the trash they go!,"The dogs loved them, but then I learned they were made in China. After the horrible events of last year there's no way I'll feed my dogs products that are made in China. I'd love to find an equivalent treat made in the U.S."
4,Handy reference,"This book is like having access to Elizabeth Zimmerman's notebook with all it's tints, tips and workings out on the construction of garments.There are some fundamentals in here that, once learnt, will mean you can knit anything you want. There are construction methods that she has worked out and explained so simply you can get to grips with it all. This is a book that you will always keep and thumb through it throughout your knitting lifetime.Great content but, these days, we're used to colour pictures and a bit more refinement on the diagrams - that's only a personal point of view and it's why I've only rated it 4 stars. What's in the book gets full marks.Not for an early beginner but a definite for an eager enthusiast."
3,Too much reading for me ...,"This is great book if you want to read about Elizabeth's life philosophies, but the book has very little in the way of 'patterns'. I was interested in making one of her so-called 'Amazing"" toddler sweaters, but it took quite a while to even get to the written instructions. I am sure her in-person classes were wonderful, but on paper I find all of it rather boring. I don't think I would have purchased this book if I had known."
2,A masterclass for knitters,"A most interesting book by an expert knitter. The skills here do not age, the projects are timeless."
3,Classic EZ,"I'm a newish knitter and I bought this book for the Baby Surprise Jacket and some of EZ's classic instruction. I'm getting a whole new way of looking at a pattern and, especially how to adapt patterns at will. I think I'll be using this book for years to come. The down side is that you do have to have some experience with knitting to understand every term she uses. I have to get help occasionally with her instructions. This is not for a total newbie."
3,Not for beginners,Zimmerman's method is great but the book is not easy to follow and takes an entirely different approach to knitting. Definitely not for beginners
4,WITTY KNITTING,"THE BOOK IS REALLY INTERESTING. I HAVE HEARD OF ELISABETH ZIMMERMANN A LOT AND THIS IS A GOOD BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE KNITTING. OF COURSE YOU MUST KNOW ENGLISH PRETTY WELL (I AM ITALIAN). THE READING IS ALSO VERY PLEASANT BESIDES VERY INGENIOUS PROJECTS TO MAKE.I THINK ONE SHOULD CALL THIS WORK A ""MUST HAVE"" IN YOUR KNITTING LIBRARY."
4,Found the Surprise Jacket,"It took some surfing, but I found that the ""Surprise Jacket"" by Elizabeth Zimmerman is in this book, so I bought it. Now I see how it is done. I have not tried it yet, but it looks very interesting. I was also pleased to see that another of her patterns that I have seen translated into machine knitting instructions is also in this book (that would be the Rib Warmer)."
5,"Another winner, one of my favorite knitting books.","There are 4 great books by EZ (Knitting without Tears, Knitting Almanac, Knitting Workshop and Knitting Around.)This one has the famous ""surprise"" sweater which looks like a rumpled bathmat and magically transforms, with a few deft flips and a bit of legerdemain, into the cutest baby sweater you ever saw. It can be modified to make an adult jacket, too.It also has plenty more useful and adaptable patterns--sweaters, hats, you name it. And since the patterns are adaptable to many kinds of wool, this is one knitting book that won't seem dated five or ten years from now.The book was written to go with a video series. Some of the videos are still available from the publisher. The book, however, stands alone as a great knitting classic, and one that I reach for all the time when I need to make a gift."
4,Oregon bar and chain,"saw worked good as expected, great packaging. speedy arrival, will recommend to others. definitely, i will purchase from them again."
4,So far so good,"The bar seems to be fine, no problems. I wasn't as impressed with the blade that came with it. It dulled really quick. I am cutting dead wood cleaning up my woods and the chisel blades seem to last longer with this type of cutting. I'll sharpen the blade and use it on softer woods. But like I said the bar seems well made."
4,Like owning a brand new saw,"I just ordered this Wednesday. And it was delivered directly to my door on Saturday. Talk about fast!! Packaging was great. Had five small trees my neighbor wanted cut down. My bar was locked up so I was looking for a replacement. This one happened to come with the chain and wasn't bad for the price. It sliced right through them with minimal effort. Next time might try the 18"" for some bigger trees I want to take down."
2,Not the quality I expected from LeBra,"Even though I followed the directions to the T, one of the plastic connectors ripped out of the fabric during installation. On several occasions I attempted to contact LeBra to see if they would cover this under warraney. I was finally told that they could not warranty it because it was purchased online and they have no record of the purchase. It cost me $40.00 dollars to have it repaired at a local upholstry shop. The fit is not that great. Woud not recommend this brand of bra for the Solara."
5,The limits of theory in explaining the breakup of YU,"This is a very well researched book that relies on complex theoretical framework to explain the breakup of Yugoslavia. Lucarelli's argument is persuasive. The only weakness of her work is over-reliance on the theory since a historical narrative could have provided equally valid explanation. However, this is a valuable scholarly work."
1,UNscriptural,"This book defines 'porneia' incorrectly, saying it only applies to fornication--sex before actual marriage, during biblical 'betrothal.' This is not true. It most accurately means 'sexual immorality' and definitely includes adultery during marriage. So Jesus DID make provision for divorce in cases of adultery! It is not always the right thing--even in cases of adultery. But in continual, unrepented adultery, it may sometimes apply."
1,Such a high view of marriage he lost the foundation,"Horrible book. Opposed to divorce. Remarriage after divorce is adultery and adulterers don't go to heaven, however he refused to tell remarried people what to do about this predicament which seemed like a copout. No understanding of the grace of Jesus Christ. If our behavior is what gets us into heaven, we're all in a heap of trouble. I am a pastor and I have never been divorced and I find this book to be a terrible exposition of what the Bible teaches about marriage, human nature and grace. ALso the fact that he wrote in a condescending manner made it dificult to read."
1,cheap quality,I think that I wasted my money! From the FIRST use it got teared!! Too overpriced for this cheap quality!!
4,Bagagge handlers proof,"We have used the bag on every plane trip and it really helps protecting the stroller when you check it at the gate. Also, it hasn't tore or anything. A really good investment. Would have given 5 stars, but one of the zippers tends to get stuck, guess it's from the use."
1,Overpriced,"This meter does exactly what it says for about 5X what other meters cost. An excellent product if you are made of money. Its like the $1,000- government toilet seat. For simple volt/amp/continuity measuring save your money. The simplest radio shack, amprobe, or extech meter will work fine."
2,Shadow of the band it used to be,"I remember this jolly good sing-along outfit covering top ten hits from my early teenagehood back in the early 70s. So when I saw this CD a couple of years ago I immediately bought it without due consideration, taking it for granted that it was the same good old band.That was a HUGE mistake. This is NOT the LHS you might think you know. It appears to be just one of many lackluster reincarnations of the band. I found this CD exceptionally boring after two or three tracks even at my very first listening."
3,Good for puppies,This toy is for puppies. Not for dogs or power chewer puppies. My puppy destroyed the rope part of this toy in less than an hour. Luckily the rubber bone is virtually indestructible.
2,Puppy Kong Bone,"This was given as a gift to my Keeshond puppy when he came home from the breeders. Doesn't like it won't chew on it, once treats are gone which is a matter of minutes. My puppy says no thank you."
3,A little too much like the first book,"If you haven't yet read the first Master Li and Number Ten Ox book, Bridge of Birds, go read it now; it's quite good. If you've already read it and want more of the same, then the Story of the Stone may slake your thirst. Be warned, however, that this iteration borrows more than just the two protagonists and the style of the first novel. Without giving too much away, too many of the plot twists from Bridge of Birds made it into the Story of the Stone. At the same time, this second novel lacks some of the grandeur and scope of the first. It's still not a bad read, though."
5,Harbinger 331200 Trigger Handle 10-Foot Adjustable PVC Jump Rope,"I've been searching for a jump rope like this for months. I wasted my time and money on non-adjustable 9' , over the counter jump ropes. This ""Harbinger Trigger Handle 10-Foot Adjustable Jump Rope"" has the perfect handles that contour to your hands and I was able to easily adjust the rope to my height. For a small purchase price of $10.00, I have a great tool to assist me in my cardio training and my overall health."
1,junk,This rope only lasted through a few weeks of fairly light (30 min/day) use before snapping at the handle and almost breaking a window in my apartment.
5,Looking for a jump rope? Awkardly tall? Here it is.,"I've gone through a recent fitness craze, and ended up purchasing a few ""at-home"" workout items. This jump rope has been perfect. It's a huge upgrade compared to the tiny, pasta-shell-like ropes I'm familiar with. This rope spins smoothly, has an attractive feel, and the handles are great. It was the perfect length for me at 6' 4"". The rope handles come up to my armpits with one foot standing over the center of the rope on the floor.If you're interested in alternative cardiovascular activities, or are hoping to stay active indoors on a rainy/cold/hot (Florida..) day, then this it."
3,Jump Rope,"I bought this jump rope because I wanted one that was long enough, I am 6'2 and thought this would be good. I like the quality of the jump rope but it was way too long for me. It said in the details that you could shorten it, but I haven't found a way to do that yet. I was a little disappointed."
4,Great affordable rope.,"You get what you pay for... most of the time. If you are active and jump rope 3 to 4 times a week for about 20 minutes, all jump ropes will die over a period of time. I could buy one that is four times as expensive, and lasts maybe twice as long... but do the math.This thing lasted about a year until the rope cracked at the grip. It could have lasted longer if I had taken the rope in a bit, and cut it properly. I tied it off inside of the grip, so it didn't rotate wrong... but next time I will know better.I am 6'6"", and I need the 10'. It's perfect for me. This is my second, and even if it only lasted 6 months, for this price.... yeah... I'll do it again."
3,Difficult to adjust length,The handles are good but it is difficult to adjust the length. I also like the thickness of the cord.
2,not remmended,"""Trigger handle"" in this case is just a gimmicky phrase, There are no buttons or triggers. The maker suggests that you ""stuff the handle into the bar and the knot it"". Works with less frustration to just wrap it around your wrist...but if that's the kind of rope for jumping that I had wanted I would have just got 75 cents worth of clothesline from the hardware store. In the end I got a bought a second rope (one with hard sectioned plastic where I could hear when it hit the ground- from another maker) and threw this one away."
4,Jump rope,"Although a little stiff especially initially, it works fine and will do the job we need ok."
3,NOT for bare feet!,"The trigger handle shape is nice, and the adjustable rope length is also a plus. But the PVC rope really hurts your toes if you like to jump barefoot. Also if you store it curled up, the bends in the rope never really straighten while jumping unless you are going 200 rpm. Tried the newfangled version, now I will go back to my ratty old soft rope. BTW, a 9' length is fine for me, and I am six feet tall. Even with adjustable 10' ropes I only had it at about 9' 2"", and you can add the extra 1"" on each side by holding the handles further back."
1,"this is NOT ""adjustable""","I bought this item, looking for an adjustable jump rope. I have owned an adjustable rope before, and was assuming that by ""adjustable"", you can change the length of the rope multiple times. Not so with this rope. You are able to change the length one time... and once it is at a shorter length, you are pretty much unable to get it back to the longer length. I will look for a truly adjustable rope and return this one."
3,not the best,"this book has a great number of abbreviations. Unfortunately, I've already looked up a couple that are not in the book."
1,"Save your money, buy bigger and better at local chain store","These are NOT soft gel when they freeze. Also, they are very small. Both of them can fit in a coffee cup. For 99 cents, you can get one that is bigger and better at Target or Wal-Mart."
5,another good product for diabetes,"I tryed these for carring my insulin around with me so if i have a problem its cold and ready to use.This is not the 1st kind i used and it worked just as well it was alittle bit cheaper that is why i bought it,and i always buy a 2 pack so when 1 dies i have another one untill i can order some new ones.Now i'm sure you are asking yourself how did it get broke well sometimes i open the zipper to fast and it will pinch the bag and thats all it takes and the blue stuff inside will come running out!"
5,JUST WHAT I WANTED!,VERY PLEASE WITH THESE ITEMS. (PRICES ON AMAZON WERE LOWER THAN THE PRICE ON EBAY).
4,Great for small insulated insulin coolers/containers,I found that one of these in my small insulin cooler would keep the pre-filled syringes cold/cool for about 4-6 hrs in normal daily conditionsI would recommend these to others
3,okay for few hours,"I does not last as long as I expected. It lasts only for six-seven hours, then you need to freeze it again in refrigerator."
5,GREAT FILM OF PLAY,I have been looking for this for years. When will they release it on dvd? The vhs versions sold on amazon are much too high.
5,Great Addition :: SAVES SAW BAR SPROCKET,Works well and will keep you from burning out the tip sprocket of your chain saw bar.Using this grease you will see the chain rotates much better on the bar and more power goes to CUTTING WOOD instead of MOVING THE CHAIN ON THE BAR.Over-all a great addition to your saw kit.
5,Well worth it!,This product is a god send.. A must have in every saw box. It has enough grease to last for many years.
2,Only buy if you own a copier...,Waste of money... My son was unintersted and the task were notdirected to perfecting anything. Only 1 letter A activity-1 letter B activity so the child doesn't get the opportunity to build a understanding of the letter. This book is only good if you buy a copier along with it to copy the pages so you can use the ditto more than once.
2,"Boring, boring and more boring!","MAn, what a boring book! Ok, anyone in his right frame of mind by now has already understood that Bush has been practicing foul play all around in his war decisions. Everybody by now knows that the reasons given to go to Iraq were fake, a total lie. But Barber uses two hundred pages to sing a single song: preventive democracy is better than preventive war. Sure. But he uses almost 300 hundred pages of the same arguments, making this a lame reading."
1,Not what I wanted/expected,"Although the picture and an earlier review of this product states that this grade/record book is shaded with gray lines, this is not true! When you actually receive the product, the inside is like any other grade/record book...green! This item's picture is a false representation of what you will actually receive if you order this item."
4,Hit & miss season,"This season of ""Housewives"" is by no means their best season; with a good blue print for a mystery, they did not fully execute the story. However, I did enjoy the majority of it. Drea De Mateo is underused, and should have been held on to longer than just a ""one season wonder"" I'm assuming that that was out of ABC's control, so I cannot hold that against them. The new packaging of this 5-Disc set is not as bad as most are complaining about. I'll put it this way, they could have used the ""slim packs"" in which case, I would tend to agree, but that's besides the point. Is season 6 of ""Housewives"" as addicting or intriguing as season one? No. Is it still a guilty pleasure that you can enjoy on a rainy saturday morning? Yes. I enjoyed season six & have bought all the seasons thus far."
4,Desperate housewives,"Packaging as advertise, received in good time period. However, some of the dvds had some minor defects, not sure why since they are new."
4,Gets into too much political correctness,"The series is good, but I was disappointed in this one compared to the first 5 in that they got into a lot of ""politically correct"" issues, such as the green movement, gay issues and Mexican heritage. While it wasn't a major part of the series (except the gay/lesbian issue) I did not appreciate it being brought into the series. We get enough propaganda about these issues from the MSM, I don't need the same in my entertainment."
2,I am sorely disappointed in the product.,I am sorely disappointed in the product. The seller said it was like new. Clearly their definition of like new means tattered & in bad condition.
5,entertaining episode,"Good cliff hanger of an ending, as a fan of Desperate Housewives, I'm looking forward to the next episode. Have fun watching!"
3,Ok,"The DVDs worked fine until the last couple of episodes, which didn't play. I had to watch them elsewhere. This was disappointing."
2,Well Trodden Path,"I gave up somewhere in Season Three, although I have caught the occasional recent episode on Fox Life. As much as the cast has changed over the years, things pretty much stay the same on Wisteria Lane. Through it all you see the same petty back biting, shifty characters and malevolence characteristic of soap operas. The show had a relatively promising start with the mystery surrounding the death of Mary Alice. Of course, there was only so far you could take this, and her voice no longer carries with it much concern as she continues to watch over her little enclave. In a rather desperate gesture, the writers have resurrected Paul Young, but there never was anything particularly appealing about him. DH appears to have filled the void left behind by such shows asDallasandDynasty, with actors you can still warm up to. But, after so many seasons Wisteria Lane has become a well trodden path with very few surprises."
2,Once great show is no longer good,"I stopped watching it this season. Horrible retreaded plots, characters that are not likable anymore and great actors like Dana Delaney given nothing good to do at all. How far this show has fallen."
2,This show has reached its prime,"I have been a dedicated Desperate Housewives fan since the beginning. Seasons 1 through 4 were excellent. Season five was okay.... now we are presented with a season full of recycled storylines (mysterious neighbor with checkered past moves in, things aren't what they seem).. yadda yadda yadda... I can't help but think the writers should have packed it up last season. I have struggled to watch this on my DVR. Every week I say ""Okay, I'll catch up on all the episodes"" and every week I try to and the show just isn't funny or entertaining any longer."
3,Disappointed :(,"I was very disappointed with the cheap paper sleeve and cheap thin case the DVDs came in. Season 6 looks so crappy next to season 1-5 on my shelf. I like the big boxes and plastic sleeves that the seasons were previously packaged in, well season 5 did have a paper sleeve, but it was still ALOT nicer that season 6's packaging. Someones getting cheap. :( Other than that I love Desperate Housewives, its hands-down the best series on TV."
2,The Wheels Fall Off,"Season five was spotty, but turned out okay in the end. But this season finally fell apart. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. The season's mystery is boring and protracted, the housewives are grating, and Dana Delaney is desperately under-served."
3,very uneven in accuracy and emphasis,"Much of the data, SAT scores and other info, was at least a year or two out-of-date. The preface stated the SAT scores would all be on the newly recentered scale, but were not.The narratives are often not changed much, if any, from year-to-year, so how up-to-date are they?The weighting system for evaluation favors Princeton U. strengths, so Princeton U. came out as best overall undergraduate experience (no surprise for Princeton grad editors!!) And, the book devotes as much space to schools of 500 as it does to schools of 50,000! There is a huge amount of variation between the academic experience of a P.E. major and a nuclear physics major at these big schools, and I'm sure one number rating for academic quality cannot do justice to both. But the book gives a good overall flavor, and I hope (presume) the numbers are overall reasonably accurate. If they gave one overall rating and publicized it, this would be more cited, I believe, than the U.S NEWS survey."
3,Outdoor/Indoor?,"I like the look and feel of the ball, and with regard to outdoor play this ball is second to none. But as for indoor play this ball does not get the job done. I play 3-4 times a week at the YMCA in my home town, and this ball just does not bounce right on the hardwood. For indoor play I would suggest a Wilson evolution or game solution basketball. If you are playing mostly outside on the concrete this is the ball for you!"
1,Buy something else,"I am extremely dissatisfied with this ball. I needed to replace a completely worn out Nike indoor/outdoor ball that I've been using for the past 5 years, and wanted something durable that didn't feel like a rubber toy.While this ball looked nice in the packaging, everything else has been disapointing. First of all, I'm pretty sure it's not even the advertised 29.5"". It feels and looks noticeably smaller than other balls I've played with. When you dribble, there is a hollow ""ping"" noise every time the ball bounces, which is both distracting and embarassing. Finally, it smells awful. My car reeked after leaving it in there for about 45 minutes.Do not want."
2,NICE LOOK BAD PERFORMANCE,"I have this ball for a year,play only outdors,this its heavy,the bounce is low,and the ball is a little big.The good: the ball no need inflate for a one year nice grip and looks great but when you play its like a concret ball(bounce very low) and so heavy.The other day i quit the rubber cap in the ball whit a tool, and i inflate,after i put the same cap in the ball(its easy for quit but very hard for put) now the ball bounce better but no like the other regulars basketballs.The ball is good only for shooting,no for dribling.I have now a ""nike cage grip indor-outdoor"" thas great.Along the years i have so many Spalding basketballs and this is the worst.If you play outdors go for a spalding zio,spalding streetball or wilson basketballs."
1,not happy,"i got the ball was so happy to receive it till i got on the court ball did not bounce properly,maybe im 2 tall for this ball might be good for kids"
1,This is a gimmick,"I got this ball as a gift and didn't realize that you can't add air by design. What if you don't like the pressure out of the box and want to add air? Too bad you are SOL. I tried to add some air to make it bounce higher and the valve went into the ball and the ball deflated. Now I have a basketball that was used once that I can't inflate again. What a piece of crap! And it was designed this way. I went to the Spalding website and of course if you try to put air in the ball, it voids the warranty. How nice."
1,Steer FAR Away From This Product,"Spalding has - with this poorly designed basketball - stooped to an all-time low rung in ineptness of forethought. The air valve is sealed, making it impossible to add air into or to release air out of the ball. And yet ironically (or rather, MORONICALLY), ""inflate 7 to 9 lbs."" is actually printed on the ball! If i weren't so disappointed i'd be laughing. A 1 star rating is far too high for this."
1,We were extremely disappointed in receiving the basketball because it was deflated. We had to call Spalding to receive a new one,"We ordered a never deflated basketball and when it arrived to our home it was deflated. We were told that this is the way it comes. So, not only did we have to pay for the ball but also the shipping charges. We then called Spalding and explained what had happened with Amazon and they sent us a brand new basketball which WAS INFLATED, the way it supposed to have arrived.So, my review is that YOU DID EXTEMELY POORLY FOR THIS PURCHASE and it is a waste of our money.Claudine Laitman"
3,was great but beginning to split,"I generally think this is a good product. It feels like its close to official weight. The grip is really good after more than a year of playing. It keeps it's air also. Of course as the temperature falls, so does the air. The only negative is that it's starting to split at one seam. Its still playable but its an issue."
5,Great,This was a great purchase for me. I love the products amazon produces they always take care of the customer.
1,Do NOT use it for outdoor play,"Based on the description and great reviews this ball has received, I decided to purchase this ball for outdoor play. Although the ball is technically ""Indoor/Outdoor,"" a few minutes of play at the basketball courts at my local park caused dust/dirt to stick to the ball and made it EXTREMELY slippery for play. Shooting long ranged shots is extremely difficult due to this and the slipperiness of the ball has detrimental effects on other aspects of the game as well. In addition, the ball makes an awkward noise when bounced and does not sound like a regular basketball bounce. An extremely unsatisfactory purchase."
1,Awful,"I got this yesterday and returned it on the same day. First, the ball sounds weird when dribbled. I know it shouldn't matter, but its embarrassing when you are playing with it. Secondly, the ball doesn't bounce right. It feels like there's lead inside and you'll need to dribble really hard in order to get the bounce you want. Overall I will NOT recommend this basketball."
4,Nice Basketball,Was looking for a basketball for outdoor play for my son. This ball has a nice bounce and great grip to it.
1,Horrible,"I'm guessing that Anne Perry didn't have much to say, and neither did the people around her, because most of this documentary is just scenery. You watch people walk in the house, then out of the house. You see the tide rolling in, then the tide rolling out. It's so incredibly boring, and you learn really nothing about Anne Perry or her life. Waste of time."
4,Season 2... The End?,"I enjoyed the first season Chappelle's Show DVD. I was expecting more out of the new DVD, but that was only because I had watched the whole season at home. The best part about the DVD is the behind the scenes footage that you don't get while watching it on tv. The Season Two blend reminds me of the FDTV dvd. The comedy is just as raw. I recommend this DVD to any collector."
4,Season 2,This DVD set will have you and your friends cracking up for hours. Dave Chappelle is crazy in this DVD set.
3,Error in product type,Was sent an incorrect zoned DVD even though my country and location were specified.
5,Funny as ever!,Amazing quality viewing on my kindle fire. Easy and convenient. And the Dave Chappelle show is as fun today as it was when it premiered!
5,THE DVD to have!,"If you don't know about Dave Chappelle by now, don't sweat it, there's still hope. This is THE DVD to have. Season one was only the unveiling of the classic. Season 2 IS the classic. It contains more hits than Barry Bonds entire career. But what's even better is that you get deleted scenes which are funny as Heck! You HAVE to get this. Forget about the news. Forget about the rumors. Get this DVD and have an excellent life. Great Product. I can understand why the pressure is on if he is trying to out do this season. I'm wondering if it can be done. Great job Dave!"
2,no cover,i dont like not getting the actual case to my dvd. i wasnt expecting that at all and was aggravated when i seen there was no cover.
4,chappelle season 2,"Season 2 has some of Chappelle's funniest skits, including the Wayne Brady/Training Day parody and the Black Bush skit. The Bonus disc has extras, and bits of Dave doing his comedy routine.My only complaint was the delivery time; it took much longer than expected, though it fell within the delivery date window."
3,Musical Performances featured in original broadcast have been removed,"As a show I give it 5 stars. The fact that the DVD is missing essentially ALL of the musical performances sucks though, and the show has a ""chopped up"" feeling to it when you watch it.Maybe this is why Dave decided not to finish the 3rd season...[this applies to season 1 & 2 of the show]"
2,???,"I haven't received my item yet. It's been more than a month, and though I've been in contact with the owner I still haven't received anything."
5,It'll get ya drunk!!!!!!!!!,"Simply put, this is the only DVD you need to buy this year. There are too many classic sketches to mention here. The bonus footage on Disc 3 has some great Rick James material. If you liked Season One (which was great in its own right), Season 2 will meet all your expectations and then some.Warning: after buying this, you will be tempted to by Half Baked."
5,Charlie Murphy and Rick James = 5 stars,"Picked this up with NewsRadio today (another great show), this set is awesome. On top of the shows, you have loads of extras including the great Charlie Murphy and an extended interview with the gone but not forgotten original Superfreak himself. Charlie Murphy's stories (the ones with Rick James and Prince and the never before seen ones on the third DVD) are worth the price of the set alone. 5 stars"
3,Uncensored....Yeah Right!,"This is upsetting to me. Great show and skits but there are some missing musical performances and also it is crazily CENSORED. The shows are exactly the same as they were on the TV. The DVD says uncensored all over it but after watching the first 4 episodes I find censorship all over it. Chappelle's edginess is what makes his shows great, censoring his shows really depletes the point and overall experience. I really hope that we could have seen this uncensored. Thanks a lot to whomever decided to lessen/worsen what could have been a great experience. Kiss my ASS!! GRRRRRRR!!"
2,cool comedy,this is a cool dvd well worth paying money for the comedy is great and Dave Chappelle intellegintly intertrines people's personality's in his joke's like when he make's fun of Lil Jon having the habit of saying yeeeeeeeeahhhhhhh and ooooookaaaaaaaaay this is well worth getting if your a fan of comedy or just a fan of entertainment that is really raw and fun . [...]
3,season 2 is pretty good,"not great, but pretty good. season one was so bad that season two looked like eddie murphy raw in comparison. i also have to mention that every single music act on both seasons were total clownshoes."
3,I'd like a pepsi with that,"I like his ideal of a drive thru ""nappy meal"", 3 pieces of fried chicken, greens, a 40 ounce of colt 45 and all the fixings..he has come a long way since his role on Fat Albert.."
2,A little dissappointed,I liked the shows when the 1st ran on tv; the unrated didn't quite live up to my expectations.
1,Not exactly me idea of comedy,"Maybe you have to be really drunk to like Dave Chappelle's comedy type, but it really didnt strike me as funny in anyway. I am the kind who enjoys intelligent gigs and satire more than swear words recycled again and again.I got this as a gift and infact have listed this on Amazon to sell. Its unbearable.If you really like comedy, buy Carlos Mencia, or even Dane Cook."
1,Do Not Buy !!!!!!!! Video is Broken !,"This Video is only 9 minutes long, and does not have the Prince sketch. Amazon needs to fix this so they deliver what they advertise !"
2,Fair,I payed a fair price for these babies and they did come in fast. I am having problems playing some of the episodes though which is whack. Also the DVDs came without the outer sleeve box which kida pissed me off
2,it works,Bought this and had it shipped to Afghanistan. We are literally building our own buildings from the ground up so that we can have office space. We were able to get some flooring and ordered this stuff. It cost more for shipping than the actual item and didn't go as far as we had hoped. I am sure it would have been great if we could have gotten more and not had to spend so much on shipping.
1,Don't judge a CD by its cover,"I am trying to replace a lost CD of beautiful, relaxing, morning desert bird sounds. This CD is not what I expected. I was eager to hear once again the desert birds like the mockingbird and quail illustrated on the cover of this CD. No track information is provided by Amazon, so I took a chance and bought this pricey album. It has only four tracks. The first, over 20 minutes long, is a donkey market in the Moroccan Sahara. Its sounds are frightening. Second, a ""multitude of birds"" at a temporary lake in the Sahara, could have been recorded on the Staten Island ferry. The third track (17 min.) opens with shrill whistling followed by dromedaries in a sand storm. The last track is a forest spring at dusk (the forest is near a desert town in Morocco)--9 minutes of frogs. I am truly disappointed with this purchase."
2,Weak effort from a great band,"""Combat Rock"" was the last album from The Clash with both Strummer and Jones in the line up. Sadly, it is a major dissapointment. It's two hit singles ""Should I Stay Or Should I Go?"" and ""Rock the Casbah"" are two stand outs amongst this unorganized collection of songs. ""Straight To Hell"" is also one of the best songs the group ever recorded. It is moody and lyrical and is one last remarkable song from one of the best rock bands in history. The rest of the tracks range from mediocre to poor. If your a big fan like myself, the album should be in your collection for the three tracks I mentioned. If your looking for an album to start with, try ""London Calling"" and their self titled debut, ""The Clash"" (both UK and US versions)."
1,A great disapointment,"After the stellar album London Calling and the magnificent Sandinista, I expected great things from this album. I remember running to the record store and getting it on the first day of release..what a disapointment. The William Burroughs stuff is dreadful and their pop hits are just awful.The Clash always had great pop sensibility...some of the tracks on Sandanista and London Calling had a great sound (Somebody Got Murdered, Washington Bullets,etc). The tunes on Combat Rock were just lame. I always thought it was a great injustice that a lot of people got their impression of the Clash from this disc and missed out on their great earlier work."
1,Bollocks on wheat toast!,"enough said.... it's bollocks. don't buy it. don't download it. don't borrow it. it's awful. I'm a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge fan of the clash. and, as a fan, i can tell you this is horrid. buy london calling instead."
1,What the hell happened?!,"From '77- '79 the Clash were a great, if different, punk band. Then, they left behind their punk roots and recorded a masterpeice called ""London Calling"". To this day it is still acknowledged as one of the greatest albums of all time. This, on the other hand, is horse manure. The Clash always experimented with different styles of music, but c'mon, did we really need disco? Instead of this dreck, buy their masterpeices: ""London Calling"", ""The Clash"", and the less good but still great ""Give em Enough Rope"". Avoid this, ""Sandista"", and especially ""Cut the Crap""."
2,Mortal Combat,"Da vidimo, sta je na ovom albumu vredno paznje? Hmmm, Should I Stay Or Should I Go, Rock The Casbah, Straight To Hell i Ghetto Defendant, i to je to od ukupno 12 pesama. Ostatak, brzo se zaboravlja i nestaje. Sumnjam da ikom osim najvecih The Clash fanova ovaj album moze da se svidi."
1,worst cd i have ever heard...EVER!,this cd makes me want to cut off my ears...i like the clash but...this cd was so horrible...go buy something that you will be able to listen to without your ears bleeding
4,A good album if you're not a Clash fan,"Why was this the Clash's best selling album? Because it appealed to more than just the true-believers. If you read through the reviews of this album, many of the faithful are saying this is the Clash's worst album, not as good as London Calling, etc. I never liked the Clash much (other than a song here and there), but I did enjoy this album. I think it is more approachable for people who are into more mainstream music (i.e. not punk rockers). I owned London Calling and the Black Market Clash EP (a 10"" record, called a NuDisc), and just never warmed to the music. But this album, although it did take a few listens to appreciate, really grew on me. Favorite song from the album? Ghetto Defendant..."
4,Simply solid,"A solid, well-played recording that highlights the multifacetd nature of this classic group. While it is evident that the group is on the skids, the ""only band that mattered"" still shows that they have one more good one left in them with this CD. Forget about ""Should I Stay or Shoud I Go"" and ""Rock the Casbah;"" such excellence is par for the course with these guys. For quiet classics, try out the ripping ""Car Jamming"" and the evocotive ""Sean Flynn."""
5,You might want to look elsewhere if you just want PUNK,"The Clash by this point were actually far removed from their purely punk asthetic. As Mick Jones once stated, they were out to prove they could do ANY kind of music and use it to their own ends. This is an eclectic set to be sure, and that's a good thing. In fact, the only thing here I don't personally like is the sing-song-y ""Inoculated City."" Everything else is at least intriguing when not totally righteous. ""Ghetto Defendant"" has a great bass line, great atmosphere (love that harmonica) and Gainesbourg's robotic interjections. ""Straight to Hell"" is an obvious classic; rarely has such a quiet song sounded so devestating.Those are just a few highlights from a very unique album that's well worth checking out. While there are some tunes that might qualify as punk, the rest are labeled as such merely by virtue of the band's reputation."
2,Nowhere near their best!,"OK, I admit, this CD does have some good cuts on it...damn good cuts, actually. But not even half this album is good. Only five songs on it are really good: ""Know Your Rights,"" ""Straight to Hell,"" ""Ghetto Defendant,"" and the two mega-hits...you see, the Clash were at least wiser than other bands to put their good songs out as singles. Still, so many of the songs are scattered and experimental that it's pitiful. You may get it for the good songs, but still...pay VERY little for it, like I did. And please get their first album and London Calling. Adios!"
3,A new perspective,"You've read 2 types of reviews - negative ones by super Clash fans who think this is a sellout, and positive ones by young MTVers who thinks this ""rox"". Well, I'm not a super Clash fan, but neither am I going to choose between 4 and 5 stars for every CD in existence. The fact is, most people will find the 2 radio hits on the CD to be by far the best music on here. In fact, I think they're very good songs. If that's a ""sellout"", so be it - they sound cool - worthy of a 4 rating. The rest is rather boring and worthy of no more than a 2 rating. If you're more into a typical Clash sound, I recommend ""London Calling"" for a studio album. If you want a ""best of"" sort of album (which certainly includes the ""best of"" Combat Rock - Rock the Casbah and Should I Stay), then ""The Singles"" looks good. By the way, if you like ""Rock the Casbah"", there's a very neat version of it on ""Super Black Market Clash"" called ""Mustapha Dance""."
2,Trash from the Clash,"I didn't like this album very much. There's a whole lot of mediocre filler on this album. Even the hits are filler -- Rock The Casbah is awful.And I guess I'm stupid when it comes to song lyrics, 'cause I can't figure out what the heck the Clash is trying to say on ""Straight To Hell."" The lyrics don't make a lot of sense to me. And the song is really pretty weak. Repetitive bass line, too lengthy at 5+ minutes, and about a three-note melody."
4,Good alternative pop-- not punk,"This is a great album for people who like pop music a little on the alternative side. This is a bad album for you diehard Clash fans who are looking for more punk music, like their earlier stuff. I love this album. There are two really bad songs though: Sean Flynn and Red Angel Dragnet. A really weird but decent song is Death Is A Star, which has some bizarre narrative about a ""killer"" and ""smoking in a dark cinema"". A lot of these songs are silly or shallow-- but so what; they're fun! So that you know where I'm coming from:(1) I HATE the following well-liked Clash songs (on different album): White Riot, Remote Control, Complete Control, Clash City Rockers. (2) I LOVE (all on other albums): London Calling, I Fought the Law, Bankrobber, The Magnificent Seven, Train in Vain, Lost in the Supermarket. If you like these songs, then you will like this album."
4,liked it best before,"i realized the lyrics... but too late... First off: Red Angel dragnet, with its Taxi Driver quotes (travis), is a rather neat song. Although I must admit, I thought he was saying ""who shot the Shaw"", which would cahnge the entire song to one of Western cultural imperialism at the expense of third world culture (hooray for Holliwood takes on new meaning in this context). Alas, even the Clash wasn't that good. But Atom Tan is just damn good, and Ghetto Defendant has a nice Reggae edge combined with a dorky white professorial voice over... But why write a review for this in the first place? And as far as people upset about it not being ""punk"", well a rose is a rose, eh? And I hve exposed people to this album who hate punk but like this. this may seem like a bad thing, but that depends on how you slice it. A cross-over album perhaps. But great nonetheless."
3,At least they tried to do something different,"unfortunatley the entire B-side of this album was an unlistenable waste. The A side is good. In this digital age I suppose that means the first half of the CD is good. Songs like ""Rock the Casbah"" etc. ""Death is a Star"" and ""Ghetto Defendant"" are real boring. I kept at it though when I first got this album way back when, figuring that it just might take some time to grow on me like ""London Calling"" did. Too bad it never did. but hey! The Clash always strove to be different, and sometimes you're on, and sometimes you're not. The Clash were more often hit the target."
2,Big Letdown After A Creative Peak,"London Callimg and Sandinista showed The Clash developing from their initial punk beginnings to a great studio band making excellent albums with much depth. The rot set in with Combat Rock, which for all purposes really is the last true Clash album(Cut The Crap can be dismissed altogether). This album is nothing more than two hit singles sandwhiched between a bunch of filler that sounds like the worst moments of Sandinista, plus two pretty decent songs ""Know Your Rights"" and ""Straight To Hell"".I have it because it's The Clash, but hardly their best."
2,ok,"""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" is decent rock. But the Clash were really quite anemic for a punk band. I saw them live twice, and they never really had much impact on the audience. When I've seen the Stones live, even nonfans jumped to their feet when they kicked into that first song. Clash fans didn't. The only great punk band was the Sex Pistols. They were great. But no other punk band touched them. Too bad the Sex Pistols split after only one album, and the Clash stayed together, rather than the other way around...."
2,the Clash's worst!,"I bought most of the Clash's albums upon their original release (including this one). Their music continually evolved, however, that evolution took a wrong turn with this album. It wasn't inventive like London Calling (yes you whipper snappers, nothing like it had been put out till then - we all realize that a lot of stuff since then has borrowed that sound) or experimental like Sandinista. Quite frankly, it's just a dumb album. I gave it two stars because it was the Clash, anyone else would have warranted less."
1,"This Is ""Punk"" ?","I bought London Calling a couple of months ago. I Loved it. So then I bought this piece of $&@# , and man was it awfull. Give em' the boot."
1,Clash in decline,"Joe Strummer had many, many more years of great music in front of him before his sad end, and that's one reason why Combat Rock is so painful to endure. In the 101ers, Strummer played ordinary rock'n'roll - before punk lit the British scene alight and pushed The Clash to the front stage. But song for song, Combat Rock loses all the anticipation that had been building up since then; it was almost as if the band had spent itself.The Clash had long since stopped being a punk band ever since the second Cost of Living EP - a classic pop record in its own right - but still made waves with eclectic rock, pop, and reggae. Combat Rock is an album in search of a style and a point of view."
4,I'll take this over the Offspring anyday...,"Is it their finest hour? No, but Combat Rock far surpasses the third rate, so-called 'punk rock' of recent years. I'll never forget the teenage me watching the Clash on late-night live tv playing 'Should I Stay Or Should I Go'; I was completely in awe---fatigues? A mohawk? I didn't even have cable, this was unbelievably exciting stuff. Today, when I hear 'Rock the Casbah' on the radio during one of those insidious 'remember the eighties' hours, sandwiched between one-hit wonder novelty nonsense, I'm angered that the Clash aren't acknowledged in their proper context---a British punk rock band who wrote brilliant pop songs, introduced reggae music and culture to white kids, and changed my life for the better."
3,"its ok, but they have much better stuff","their biggest radio hit, yet most annoying song ""should I stay or should I go"" is contained herein, as well as a mix of good songs and fairly forgettable ones. I like a few songs here, but it honestly doesn't hold up well, and as a big fan of London Calling, I was very dissappointed that the Clash could release such a mediocre album after that masterpiece. I still give this cd a listen occasionally, but I will probably sell it later, because the Clash have other exciting albums that are good all the way through. I urge you to get a best of collection of the Clash, because honestly there are some pretty sweet songs on here, like ""car jamming,"" ""rocking the casbah,"" and ""ghetto defendent"" that might be on a best of set. I don't know, I guess having the good tracks is worth it, but I was dissappointed by the incohesiveness. get London Calling and their self-titled album instead."
4,Really 4 1/2,"Such a good album. Many people will say this was the CD that lead to the downfall of The Clash, but I think not. Good lyrics, good music, and an edge not found in their previous work I feel. Know Your Rights is the best opening track ever. I love the variety of music, from the dance beats to the urgent messages to the rock-backed-with-Spanish-vocals. Be open minded. Buy it."
3,It pains me to rate a Clash album this low,"While Combat Rock contains their two most famous songs (Should I Stay or... and Rock the Casbah) overall it is a disappointment. Know Your Rights is a great song to quote from, but it sounds more like a bizarre anarchist manifesto than a song, even when they're singing it. Should I Stay or... is a song which almost everyone has heard on the radio, unfortunately it's not representative of the Clash. If anything, it sounds like something you'd expect from the Cure. Straight to Hell is the albums one redeeming quality, which captures the bands sarcasm and cynicism perfectly, yet it can't make up for the unevenness of the album. In general, this CD contains quite a few forgetable songs, a few that will stay in your head, but nothing special."
3,Worst Episode Ever!,"Being a fan from the very beginning, 1978, this album was a big let down. To clean and commercial sounding. The edge was gone. The beginning of the end. This was followed by those 'rock star' shows at Shea opening for The Who. Gave it 3 stars because it includes 'Straight To Hell', a great Clash track."
3,Still Figuring this Out,"Maybe I'll like this album better after a few listens, but a lot of the stuff on it I just don't get. I do really like ""Rock the Casbah"", but I already knew that one. It's good to be able to play it now though. ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" is actually not as annoying as I first thought- it has a sort of crude rock'n'roll charm to it. This album is disappointing when compared with albums like ""The Clash"" and ""London Calling"", but then those are tough acts for any band to follow."
2,Biggest disappointment,"'Combat Rock' was the biggest musical disappointment of my life: an album by my (then) favorite band that I couldn't even listen to a second time. And then, adding insult to injury, it becomes their best seller! But I don't think of it as a sell-out because it wasn't bad because it was trying to be commercial; it was just bad. The Clash, with 'Sandinista!' and the single 'Radio Clash', were beginning to develop a rock-reggae-rap fusion that could've become a new pop-music genre; but they blew it."
2,"Forget the good music, we've got the bollocks!","It sucks, get used to it! Rock the Casbah? BOLLOCKS! Should I Stay or Should I Go? Mediocre! Know Your Rights? An okay song. Straight to Hell? Actually a good song. THOSE ARE THE FOUR BEST SONGS ON THE ALBUM! Do yourself a favor: Get London Calling! The Legacy Edition, even. That's World's best album. This, is a load of crap."
2,I love the freakin clash but,"The clash are one of the greatest bands of all time too bad that they were having so many conflicts and were almost completly leaving their punk roots. with the success of ""train in vain"" and ""london calling"" the band decided to return to something they could pretty well after realesing sadinista! which was ultimately just too ambitous a record. The best songs on here are ""know your rights"" and ""straight to hell"" everything else if horrible rubbish. Get this only to complete your collection. get everything else first and forget about cut the crap."
2,Little to recommend on this one,"Meandering reggae sound experiments and preachy lyrics condemn this Clash effort to the little played pile. After the ferocity of earlier work, this sounds like a band that has lost direction or worse has been co-opted by a feeling of self-importance. The only memorable numbers are the juvenile singles ""Rock The Casbah"" and ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" which at least have melody and rhythm to recommend them. ""Straight To Hell also jumps out as an example of more restraint getting better results in the midst of all this chaos. If at least the sonic clarity was better, the effort to wade through the noise and mumbling might be worth while, but as it is this was a few plays for me and then it will be collecting dust."
2,BIg,I really liked the syle of the watch but the watch is way too big and bulky. Wish there had been more pictures or at least a ruler in a picture to see the true size. I returned it and Amazon refund me.
3,Over all a good book,This was an overall good book though it started off slow. Once the book picked up I was able to keep up. The only bad thing I would say is the long drawn out process of her being able to be intimate with Devin. I'm sure it would take any person who's been thru something as tragic as that time but i just felt it was toooooo drawn out. Other than that the book was pretty good.
1,this was a bad choice,"i recently purchised one of these item and it was a big disappointment, the charger didnt come any where near charging my np-80 battiers, the power cord led will stay lit red while the main unit that connects to the battery stays green even when the batterys isnt in it."
5,A wonderful book,"I'm going to join the chorus of positive reviews for this book. I, too, was intrigued about Christian the lion after viewing the famous 1971 video on YouTube. The story about Christian described in the book turned out to be as warm and entertaining as I expected it to be. The authors bought Christian on a whim, then grew to love him, and the feeling was returned in full by this ebuillent king of beasts. I was happy to see that the authors worked so dilligently in finding a way for Christian to return to his native habitat, and in doing so, open the door to a better life for Christian. I felt their pain when they viewed their beloved lion pal for perhaps the last time. I also hope that the rest of Christian's life was a happy one, for he was without a doubt, one cool cat."
5,A Lion Called Christian,"Really enjoyed reading this book. I saw the Youtube video of course, but obviously there was much more of this story to be told. God bless Ace and John, they gave Christian the most wonderful gift possible, in two parts, first being their loving care of him, and then giving him a free and natural life. Lots of humor involved, too. A really satisfying read."
4,entertaining,"It's a quick, entertaining read. If you're familiar with Born Free and the Adamsons, you'll probably appreciate this book, althought it's nowhere near that level of literature. Without a lot of detail or descriptions, the authors have told their story. Expect to read this in an afternoon...it's a short book."
5,Heartwarming Story - Highly Recommend,"This story goes far beyond the short video clip of Christian's first reunion with his owners. It takes you on the journey from the moment they first laid eyes on him, to his ultimate venture into the wild. Loved the story. Gave me a whole new perspective on this wonderful breed of animal."
3,wild animals,"It was an excellent book. A true story. It reminds you of the books Born, Forever and Living Free by the Adamsons. George Adamson is actually mentioned in the book. It is about two college friends that raise a lion in their apartment and eventually realizes that they have to get rid of it. The zoo is not an option, so they arrange to set it free in africa with George Adamson's help."
5,A love story between a lion and the people who loved him.,I believe it is a wonderful love story between humans and animals. It is a great read and if you like animals you will love this.
5,Remarkable and touching,"This book was hard for me to put down. I found the telling of the story of the bond between the two friends and their lion very touching. I admit I hadn't heard about Christian until I saw the youtube video, but feel lucky to have gotten a chance to read this book."
5,Could not put the book down.....,This is the first book that I've sat down to read and did not put the book down until I had finished it.. A love story for all animal lovers..
1,revisionist history,"Heartwarming story, my foot. If you read George Adams memoirs, you will know that Christian, that adorable lion, was most likely killed by other lions or people, in no short order, and never was happy in Africa, except in that video, when he probably thought he was going home. He was tame, and not fit for life in the wild, and it was idiotic of those boys to send him to Africa, when he could have led a happy, healthy life in a wild animal park in England and they could have visited often. I find it horrendous that we buy into this nonsense - and those boys, now adults, are still trying to profit from their ill-informed idealism. Could you survive in the wilds of Africa? Well, neither could Christian. And we go, awwww, when what they did was cruel and inhumane. Send them angry letters, and don't buy this book - that is what they deserve. They should not profit from Christian's suffering, and the unnecessarily cruel fate that they engineered."
2,A waste of money on this one,"It's obvious that the publishing company and the authors saw a quick way to make a quick buck by capitalizing on the popularaity of the youtube video. Watch the video- don't buy the book for the second time, it's a complete waste of money."
2,Rather boring,My 34 year old daughter loves animals but thought this video was rather boring. She said that it had some interesting information but that she was disappointed in its content.
5,a beautiful story of a lion who earned his freedom in the African plains,A beautiful story of two young men who help a lion go from a life in a pet shop to a life of freedom on the African plains. A lovely story...Born Free: A Lioness of Two WorldsAutumn of blessed Acres: Service Dog (Volume 1)Autumn of Blessed Acres service dogThe Horse Keeper: The Healing Gifts of Painting and Writing About Horses
3,Would be perfect if it didn't have to be replaced every year,"The clips in the back of the container that hold the base on keep breaking no matter how careful I am. It's a great little feeder that is easy to clean, but just don't like having to buy one or two every year to replace it."
5,Window Hummingbird Feeder,I bought one and everyone that saw it bought one too. It is a hoot to be able to watch Hummingbirds up close. I got such good pictures through the window standing at an angle and with the flash off. I sent one to my parents who are in their 90's and they said everyone that saw theirs bought one too.
2,Birds & Bees Love,"Got the feeder and it leaked as soon as I filled it,hubby used a sealer in it (Fixed) gather hummers within second. As soon a the bees found it was a NO win battle for me. Tried everything oil spray (not good really for the hummers) IT DOES WORK BUT AS THE BEE KEEP TRYING... WHAT A MESSY MESS ON YOUR WINDOWS...This is easy clean, but hard to resnap clips on back sure they will not last long before they break. I say birds like if you have No bees try it. Gave it to my dad he does not get many bee it it is working out for him.(Of couse he is not changing it ONLY ME CAREFULLY) & his is only changed once a week where I had to due daily... Try & maybe you willbe lucky."
4,Love the Action,"I absolutely love this window feeder. Caution though when cleaning it. The little red tabs that attach the two pieces will break if you are not careful. Just handle them gently and you should be okay. It would be nice if one could order an extra bottom. When mine broke, a little duct tape did the trick. I did order another one though. I like so much to watch them at close range. I get to see them like never before. Facinating and beautiful little birds. I really like the view."
2,Flimsy and breakable,"It holds together very loosely with a thin plastic latch that breaks after a few uses, resulting in the water spilling out and no way to close it again unless you use lots of strong packing tape. Even when it does work, the pieces hold together loosely and it leaks a lot."
1,Broken on arrival,After filling the reservoir the reservoir slots into the base and is held onto the the base with a small plastic arrow. Didn't even work once. The arrows were too small for the fitting and the bottom fell off as soon as I turned it right side up. I've just thrown it away rather than bother with a return.
1,Do Not Buy,The clear plastic that holds the clear part to the red bottom to the is way too easy to break. It's a shame because the hummingbirds like to use it -- and it's a great way to watch them. I have bought four of them and no matter how careful I am it breaks sooner or later!
1,"hard to fill, hard to clean","Although our hummers love this feeder, and a window feeder lets us see them readily, this feeder is difficult to fill and difficult to clean. There are 2 plastic hooks that you compress to open it; the first broke within the first two fillings, and the second broke a few weeks later. I've jury-rigged it with wire, but you have to clean and refill these feeders often, so another design that opens more easily would be much better."
3,"Generally good, but doesn't last very long.","I found this product to work well, generally: it lasted about a season for me and being able to watch the birds up close was really neat. If you're new to hummers, it's an easy, fairly inexpensive way to get started. However, after using it for a few months the piece that connects the reservoire to the base broke and I ended up having to go buy a new one. I bought 3 of these (the same thing happen with each) before deciding to spend a bit more to avoid that hassle. (And by that point, the hummers had discovered the feeder and were visiting regularly, so I had to replace it quickly!)"
1,Lasts one year barely.,The hummingbirds love it but it is hard to take the flowers off to clean and the red base fades within months. You will have to buy it yearly. Too bad the bottom wasn't made better.
3,"Okay, but leaks","This was a replacement for a very similar one I had that broke over time due to brittle sun baked plastic, man handling and filling.This one I had to screw attach the bird foot rests which didn't rotate in easy. I felt like I could break it easily.Once it was assembled I presented it to my fleet of long awaiting Hummers. They took to it like the previous. 24 hours into commission I was horrified to see a large bloody trail down the white and glass panels of our french doors that lead to a red stick pool that flowed along the saddle of our door. It was leaking. After dumping the reservoir I blocked where I guessed the leak was with super glue. This was a little help. Twice again I had to apply glue and twice again I had to scrub my white doors and deck of the red sticky mess.Yes I agree, this is a fragile construction. Waddaye expect for ten bucks? DIY - AOK."
2,"Nice feeder, but needs two suction cups","I purchased three of these feeders. The hummingbirds enjoy feeding from them, but the single suction cup always fails. The feeder is pretty durable and survives the fall a few times, but eventually breaks.I found a double suction cup bird feeder bracket at Wal Mart for under $3 that holds a heave glass feeder with no problems. This little feeder simply needs to be retrofitted with better a better suction cup design.I wouldn't recommend this feeder."
3,"Love the window mount, but breaks easily","I love this hummingbird feeder because it gives you a really close view of the hummingbirds. However, the plastic clips that attach the base to the reservoir break easily. I've been able to continue to use the feeder even with 1 clip (versus 2) so all was not lost. I ordered a new feeder, and I'm trying to be extremely careful with the clips. So far, so good. I've refilled it several times and both clips are still intact."
4,Wonderful,"One of the back latches broke off after about 2 months of use, but I am still using it with just one--although very carefully. This is the 3rd I have owned in the past 5 years. The plastic latches on the back are just not made to last, but otherwise, it is a perfect invention. Great way to watch the little creatures!"
5,Great feeder for flat mounting,This feeder is great for mounting on a fence or deck or anywhere that you have a flat vertical mounting surface.
5,the best,"this humming bird feeder is flat on one side allowing you to see the critters as they fly and drink,hard to find feeders, much recommended."
1,Plastic tabs hold this together....,"Two, small plastic tabs are the only thing holding this unit together and they become brittle after a short while, perhaps from the heat and/or sun exposure. You can count on those tabs breaking off too, either the first or second time you have to refill it. Its a great idea and the hummingbirds liked it, but don't buy unless you can accept this feeder as being a disposable feeder instead of a reusable one."
2,Plastic tabs securing reservoir to feeder too flimsy.,"My cats loved this feeder (on the inside looking out, of course), and so did visiting hummingbirds. We made our own nectar (red dye may be bad for hummingbirds!), so we could see them through the reservoir. It is relatively easy to clean, and its 8 oz. capacity was perfect for our hummingbird traffic.The very big downside is that the plastic tabs securing the reservoir to the feeder are too flimsy. I broke two of these feeders in two years. If Perky Pet would improve the design (i.e. how the reservoir connects to the red base/feeder), I'd reconsider buying one. Lost my receipt (didn't buy it from Amazon) so can't get a refund. I did make the one that broke mid-season work a bit longer by taping the reservoir to the base. Electrical tape might be ugly (something else might work better), but it worked fine."
2,Was Fine While It Lasted,"The hummingbirds did drink from it, but only one bird at a time. Whenever more than one bird would arrive they would chase each other away. Also the clear prongs on the back side that attach the clear reservoir to the red base snapped off after a few months of use, even though I was extra gentle whenever I refilled it after reading from other customers how theirs broke."
1,Mounting clips broke,"The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder, but the clips that attach the reservoir to the base are flimsy and cracked within 3 months."
1,Don't believe 'em,"I'm stuck with paying return postage which I hardly consider fair. See the lovely picture? Perfect. Mine arrived in a sort of fleshy tan and BRIGHT, bright, red and green stripes--NOTHING like the picture or description. It is well woven, but ugly. This company calls itself a fair trade company. What of being fair to both weaver and purchaser?"
4,Power on,"For anyone aiming to compete in multisport events and other high intensity sports this book is all you need. Goal setting, training programmes and training regimes are explained and discussed in easy to follow steps. It got me through the Coast to Coast, the worlds toughest multisport event. What can I say, other than, go out and read it!"
5,"Good, muy bien...","El sonido excelente, La produccion magistral, el sonido en mi opinion puede estar haciendo historia en nuestras bandas de rock.Es una lastima que nuestro rock latino se pierda entre oidos sordos e ignorantes.Por que este trabajo yo personalmente lo considero lo mejor de lo mejor, Lo comparo con: Dinamo, D.J.L.N., Big Band, y El Amor despues del Amor..Solo que mucho mas innovador, sobretodo en al guitarra que los grupos de esta epoca ya ni consideran......Mis respetos, muy buena musica, todo en general."
4,Sri Lanka Travel Guides/Maps,"Very nice map, but not hard to say as there are so few maps of Sri Lanka that are worth looking at. The only complaint that I have is that International Travel Maps only show a blow-up of Colombo, whereas Nelles Maps of Sri Lanka have blow-ups of Colombo, Kandy, Anuradhapura, and Galle, but no Negombo blow-up. I purchased a Globetrotter Travel Pack w/map (pretty good map/package deal) in Negombo a couple years ago, that was a good deal, it's a smaller travel guide compared to Lonely Planet, Rough Guide to Sri Lanka, Footprint Sri Lanka, Insight Guide Sri Lanka, & Culture Shock Sri Lanka of which I have one of each but basically handier when in the trenches of Sri Lanka. If you prefer blow-ups of major population areas go for the Nelles Map, if you don't need blow-ups then get the International Travel Maps version."
2,"Flakier than Tony the Tiger, but lots of fun --","__________________This book is good for some laughs, but also reiterates a number of problems in conventional concepts of human origins. Barclay cites and quotes from a number of other UFO and alien books and authors, and generally breezes through a very controversial thesis -- that humans were genetically engineered for use as pets by an intelligent reptilian species which lived alongside their relatives, the dinosaurs. This isn't that different from Sitchin's opus maggots, but is much more fun, and much scarier. See also Elaine Morgan's books, including the recent The Scars of Evolution (019509431X), which rehashes her aquatic ape origin hypothesis; The Sirius Mystery (089281750X), which is fun to contemplate in connection with our possible aquatic origin; and Mankind, Child of the Stars (1886940061) by Otto O. Binder and Max H. Flindt, which is cited a lot by Barclay."
3,HP Pavilion ze5470us,"I have this one myself, I bought it in Oct 2003 and in Dec of 2006 the hard drive crashed. I went to HPs website and they want $665.00 for a replacement and that's without tax or shipping. Up until this, it was working fairly well, I didn't really have too many problems and I was enjoying it. I didn't really even use it all that often so I am a bit upset that the hard drive went out so quickly. But, per one of the earlier reviews I read, it seems to be an issue for HP, so I will say, my next laptop will not be an HP, wish I would have known now what I didn't know then kind of thing."
3,HP Pavilion ze5470us Notebook PC,"A pretty good computer, but as with all HP's, there are hard drive issues (3 replacements for mine), fan cooling issues (2 replacements for mine) and not enough ram or video memory. Other than that, it is a good computer to use if not for graphics and animation. For those types of activities, a Mac is better.http://www.cjvandesign.com"
2,Barely suitable for boxing or hard training,"The rope is too light, it is quite impossible to reach a good, fast, jump rhythm. Good for children but if you really want to work properly and jump the rope buy something else."
1,Disappointed with this product,"Remington CIF75DT Teflon Fiber Ceramic Curling Iron, 3/4 InchI purchased this curling because I have had good experiences with other Remington curling irons. I did not like this curling iron. The ""cool tip"" was anything but cool. It got very warm to the touch. The other problem that I experienced with this curling iron was that it did not grip my hair. My hair is fine and it slipped right out of the barrel clip when I tried to use it. Also,it was accidently turned off while in use by bumping the off button when I clamped down the barrel clip. The price was good but I found this curling iron to be a big disappointment."
5,Hip-hop album of the summer,"Tha liks (formerly Tha Alkaholiks) return to the hip-hop scene on their album ""X.O. Experience"". These three MC's E-Swift, Tash & J-Ro drop fire all over this album, with entertaining and innovative lyrics that flow perfectly with the dope beats all over the CD. Buy this album now, listen to it like crazy over and over, because this is a sure fire classic in just a few years."
4,CRIMINALLY UNDERAPPRECIATED,I had never heard of these guys until a couple of years ago in 2002 when I was at the record store and I picked this up. I wasnt sure what to expect but when I popped this in I was litterally blown sky high. This is reppin the west coast underground to the fullest this has a similar style to the LIVING LEGENDS but in my opinion is much better. There are a few corny tracks and some might think they have slipped by enlisting that WACK no talent PHARRELL on a couple of tracks but this is a great CD.
2,betting maidens and 2 year old,This book was a disappointment.It was more of a historical account of specific horses and races rather than a how to as it proclaimed.It was very hard to follow and I kept waiting for him to get to the point. Very boring and monotonous.
2,Already obsolete,"Focuses on top sires, which is OK, except that in last 8 yrs much of that has changed. wish he spent more time analyzing works and workout patterns."
1,Quality piece of dump,"This book has a great title and the backing of the DRF; that's where the quality stops. The author is a young kid with little gambling experience, but it really seems like he spent more time on the computer than at the track. He gives you page after page of data that can probably be put into a 2 page spread sheet.Not worth $5, let alone $20"
2,Tools is the only plus here.,Not at all what I was expecting. The book covers nothing that I wanted to know about wiring at all. Nothing on the different types of splitters (for cable)and switches (for satellite) that would be needed or even compatible with the different satellite companys. VERY VERY basic info. Only good out of it is the tools and even those IMO or still not pro quality though they are still better then most (if you ever bought a cable stripper from Radio Shack you know what I mean). Waste of money? Not really if you know absolutly nothing. Do some searching on the internet first then find you some nice tools and supplies and then your all set.
4,Nice Watch,"Its a nice watch, looks well built and I was looking for the automaticfeature. It is very big compared with most watches but fits my wristcomfortably because of the curved ends where the band is attached. I'mtall (6'2"") 210 lbs, so it looks good on me, but smaller wrists it may beto much watch. The only disapointment was the very small date window. Iwas hoping for big features in order to see without my reading glasses.(The whole purpose of buying this big monster!)"
5,nice big watch!,"very nice watch for the price! it is elegant and casual, but be carefull it is really big, i am 1.86m tall and it looks big in my hand, if you want a big automatic watch, buy this! it looks more expensive than 99$..."
2,invicta watch,the website advertised its diameter as 49 mm. it was closer to 42mm. it also did not have the quality i was expecting for a manual watch.
4,Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Ocean Ghost Automatic Watch,"Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Ocean Ghost Automatic Watch #3036A VERY HANDSOM HI QUALITY WATCH, I WANTED A YELLOW FACE THAT WAS EASY TO SEE AND DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A KIDS WATCH, I HAD THE SS BAND REPLACED WITH A MATCHING YELLOW RUBBER STRAP AND IT GETS THUMBS UP EVERY WHERE I GO. I KEEP IT ON A WATCH WINDER WHEN NOT ON MY WRIST AND IT LOOSES VERY LITTLE IF ANY TIME, THE MOST I HAVE TO DO IS ADJUST A SECOND OR TWO AFTER A DAY OR WEEK OF BEING ON THE WINDER. WHILE WEARING IT IT DOES NOT LOOSE OR GAIN TIME."
3,"Interesting, yet slow on the follow up","Jurgen Prochnow stars in a thought-provoking film about economics, politics, and money. Ralph Korda (Prochnow) stars as the genius engineer responsible for creating the ""WorldCar"" an enviromentally correct automobile made for a multi-national car corporation The Berlin Auto Group. As word gets out that the ""WorldCar"" has made its debut, everyone wants a piece of the pie. France pushes Korda into making deals with them, while in the meantime, a large Arab oil magnate wants him dead in order to maintain the oil market. All in all, a very interesting film, but gets lost in the confusing end sequences of the film. I actually give it 3.5 stars if such a thing is possible. Prochnow is fairly good, and ruthless of course. "" I don't give a damn about the enviroment, my car just happens to be enviromentally safe"" A good view with an interesting story."
2,Dulls easily,Dulls to unusable in less than 30 minutes of cutting soft wood. Never hit the ground nor were we cutting into any hard woods.
5,Essential for collectors - fun for the curious,"Fully illustrated with 245 fetishes in full color. Plus charts, map, and family trees.By now the purchaser know about Zuni Fetishes. This is a good collection of the contemporary. However one of the reasons this book excels is because it focuses on the materials that make the fetishes and their carveability.I became intrigues in fetishes after reading ""People of Darkness"" by Tony HillermanPeople of Darkness"
4,great product,This chain seems to work just like the original. Good product at a great price. I would buy it again.Thanks guys
5,Best replacement chainsaw chain,"I have used Oregon chain saw chains for many years, and they have always been great quality. I would recommend them to anyone needing a replacement chain for their saw."
5,better than the chain that came with the saw,this chain has more teeth than the original saw came with and works very well. does not bog down the electric chainsaw i put it on
2,Stay Back,"Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton."
4,Drags slightly here and there but enjoyable overall.,I enjoyed this book but not as much as I might have because of the way the two stories-in-one break up the smooth flow of both. Those letters of Raffia's read like chapters in a book not letters and that long windedness cause's the book to drag. Also almost as soon as Sargent Synap enter's the story you know what will happen and who will be responsible. I will say that the modern story suffers not from any of this but simply from being constantly interupted and also the fact that her characters get into situations that I found very hard to buy into. Anyone who would shove a 800 pound boat engine on someone is not likely to suffer a fit of remorse and pull it off because they did not want you to suffer. But Nevada pulled off enough surprises to keep me reading and in the end I was glad I did.
2,disappointed,"The technique of telling two stories in alternate chapters did not work.Neither story ever got off the ground and the endings were dull!We are Nevada Barr fans,but finishing this book was a chore rather than a pleasure.Sorry!"
1,"Bad, very bad! (Good for Insomniacs!)","This was painful, both my Wife and I are fans of the 'Anna Pigeon' series, so I thought to get the un-abridged CD for a trip across country, what a mistake! My God, this was dull, boring, and silly. How did I stay awake listening to this while driving, and why did my wife not shoot me for buying this, I just don't know?"
2,I didn't like this one,"Generally I'm very impressed with Nevada Barr's ""Anna Pigeon"" series. This one is dreadful. She should leave her Deep South biases out of her books, a culture I despise to begin with (I had to endure one-third of my life in the South until I escaped in the mid-80s)--but that isn't the crux of the problem.This isn't really a novel. It jumps around through time, she was unable to create sympathy with ANY of her Civil War protagonists, the Yankee villain is a reversed Simon Legree (totally cardboard; I wouldn't believe even a Confederate jailer at Andersonville could be that bad), and altogether it's a muddle. Knowing I'd never read it again, I gave this one away.Better writing next time, Ms. Barr."
2,Flash--I want my money--back,"The reading was tedious and the forced metaphors were annoying; ex., her fingers were like white spiders. The book was loaded with these stupid metaphors. Was this really a bestseller? Golly jeez."
3,Good but descriptive writing is a little too much,"This book has 2 good interweaving stories. The one that takes place during the Civil War era is the most interesting. But I almost stopped reading it when I hit pages 114-115 znd tried to make sense out of 2 sentences. On page 114 the sentence ""Unfortunately stillness without exacerbated restlessness within."" And on page 115 ""A wave of emotion so strong it wrung a flood of tears from eyes dry an instant before overcame her."" Huh? Generally, I have always enjoyed Nevada Barrs books, but also always thought her writing was a little too descriptive. But the above examples are beyond descriptive. I did pick it up again and finished it because of the Civil War story."
1,Flashback,"A disappointing addition to the series. Language is stilted, dual story line distracting. Neither story line is believable. Alternating chapters lack continuity."
4,Is Anna becoming a simp?,"Like some of the other reviewers, I count the days (months, years) waiting for the new Anna Pigeon books....this wasn't the best that Nevada Barr has ever written but was still very enjoyable. I found no problems with jumping back and forth in time but it did become tedious. Note to Ms. Barr...if you do have Anna get married, I will probably quit reading your books. Marriage always changes the dynamics...the woman is no longer tear-... strong, but has to run home to hubby for advice, hugging, healing sex, help in any way or form. Please don't do that to Anna. Need proof...read ""Joanna Brady"" before and after..."
3,Lost in the Flashbacks,"I love Anna Pigeon. It is probably because, like Anna, I am ""middle-aged"" and finding my way in a world that I didn't imagine I'd find. Added to that is a history that includes many of the places in which Barr sets her stories. The descriptions of sights, sounds, and events create flashbacks of my own. But this adventure was very different. This was not the mystery I had hoped to find. I kept getting lost in the tale and had to backtrack, several times in places, just to find my way. I think Barr would have done the two stories combined here better service if she had untangled them and told them separately.I have read every Anna Pigeon book with anticipation, and expect to see more of her is future stories. However, I hope to see more of the Anna I have come to cheer for -- that smart, spunky, intrepid woman who refuses to compromise who she is, and what she wants."
4,"Entertaining book, lousy editing","I very much enjoyed this novel, although having the nineteenth-century letter writer just happen to write like a novelist seemed problematic. What I did not enjoy was the editing/proofreading, which was terrible! A respectable publisher and intelligent author ought to be able to do better."
3,Too much Flashback,"What a disappointment. I wait anxiously for a new Nevada Barr book, and was excited to receive Flashback. I was ready to follow Anna Pigeon's life.... her new assignment, her future romance, the happenings with Molly and her husband, but instead I was detoured through an historical novel which was clumsily and unbelievably presented as a bundle of letters written long ago. The coincidences I found to be too much, and the device of skipping back and forth was annoying to say the least, slowing down the development of each story.The Anna part of the book was fine, cleverly developed as always with clues for the astute reader (not me!) to pick up in order to solve the mystery.Please skip the history, Nevada, and keep giving us more of Anna.PS Is it Ne-vay-da or Ne-var-da?"
2,Not a smooth read,"Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging. I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection. To each their own but it is not something I would recommend."
1,"Contrived - neither well-written fiction, nor well-narrated history","I read this on the recommendation of a friend. We obviously have differing ideas of a good read. I finished the book, only because I need to justify the time invested in beginning the read. After the third ""life or death"" nail-biting situation in which Anna finds herself, with the book only half finished, I was sorely tempted to ditch the book and call the time spent a lesson learned. How ""intrepid"" can one character be before she's deemed to be stupid? The Civil Was portion of the narrative failed to engender sympathy for any of the characters and bordered on boring. By the end, the only characters I had any minor feeling for were the lesbian lighthouse keepers. The use of Anna's ""discovery"" of the dead from both narratives in the same spot felt as though Ms. Barr was bored as well and strove to just finish the thing up."
3,Indecision,"Paul Davidson, former priest and sheriff in Natchez has proposed marriage and Anna Pigeon isn't sure this is what she wants. To put a little space between her and a long-term relationship she accepts a temporary assignment at Dry Tortugas National Park. An island, anything but conducive to contemplation as she finds herself involved in three different mysteries.To keep the plot elements separate and moving Nevada Barr executes a splendid juggling act. Molly, Anna's sister send her a packet of letters written by a great-great-aunt who had lived at the fort during it's days as a prison. Rich in historical detail, a clever blend of the past and present, plus Anna's dilemma will insure fans follow the trail to a surprising conclusion. Maybe it is the complexity or diverse elements, but somewhere something is lacking, FLASHBACK isn't up to par for a Barr.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,still good after eleven books,"Fans of the Anna Pidgeon books will like this eleventh installment in the series. This time, Anna is stationed at Fort Jefferson at Dry Tortugas Park, a set of small islands off the coast of Florida. There is the usual large cast of primary and peripheral characters and the usual twist at the end that makes it hard to guess just who the criminal is during the first half of the book. Every other chapter focuses on Anna's ancestors who were at the fort in its active days. I found this storyline somewhat interesting, but kind of distracting. The book would have been fine without it. Still, I enjoyed the book and can't wait for the twelfth!"
4,letters are great,I love Nevada Barr & have all of her books. But this one was not her best. It starts out very slow. But poor Anna is almost killed again near the beginning of the book. But the best part of this book are the letters from her great-great Aunt. If fact they were so good that I read them to the end & then went back & read the story about Anna. This poor woman is almost killed at least 3 times in this story. The beginning is slow. It starts to pick up around the middle but the last of the book is so good you can't put it down. Even though it is not her best it is still a good book.
4,Great addition to house,The nursery is a great addition to the Dora house. My daughter received this for Christmas and adores the babies. The only thing that disappoints me about the nursery is that it doesn't compact down like the house. It also doesn't attach to the house very well.
5,mmto,Very pleased with my purchase as it was for a giving tree recipient and l know he will be pleased.
5,STRAIGHT JAMMIN',"This is the album that inspired me to really dig the depths of reggae. This Third World album is worth listening to. ""Try Jah Love"", You're playing us to close"", and Before you make your move"" are worth the price alone. Listen to them, and you won't be sorry!"
4,Dilbert Meets John Grisham,"A great summer read! A Grisham type plot with humorous veins running through it, the story tells of a burned out banker who desperately wants to move on in life with the aid of a severance package from his megabank employer. Every time he turns around, he gets hit with another challenge. Fraudulent borrowers. One, then two law suits. Marriage problems. Bureaucratic bosses getting their own severance packages and leaving him to start over in his quest for one. I especially enjoyed Chapter 26, ""The Meeting"", which sounded all too close to home. The ending and the final steps to it seemed a bit of a stretch, but, overall, this is an enjoyable way to spend some reading hours."
5,Great read - glad I'm self-employed!,Facinating look at the inner workings of the business world. This author's first novel grabs your attention and keeps it through the conclusion.
5,Excellent Read,"I found Severance Package to be a captivating novel that embraces not only the realities of corporate life but also the bizarre - which very often translates into reality. This book is a page turner that you will not be able to put down. Written along the lines of a Grisham novel, Nilsson captures the true essence of corporate life - from the frustrating existence of middle managers to the egotistical behaviors and mannerisms of the people with whom we work and to whom we all report. Interwoven in this story are true-to-life descriptions of life in Minnesota which include characterizations of typically conservative Scandinavian personalities to portraits of downtown Minneapolis. If you want to read about the people you work with, I recommend you get your own Severance Package. You won't be disappointed."
1,(...),"(...)This is like the Dick and Jane books we learned to read with. That was fine for first grade but come on, we're adults now. Don't waste your money."
2,"Good overview, but lacks important explainations.","I found Mr. Coley's book good for a quick read, but there were several important areas that really annoyed me.First the good:Did a nice job of hitting on the key areas of Dreamweaver & Fireworks.Now the bad:1)There was no common thread, ie no project to tie everything together. It's all presented in disjointed bits and pieces.2) Sometimes a later topic (tasks as Coley refers to them) builds upon an ealier Task that he assumes the reader has saved. But he does not tell the reader that they should save them for later!3) Does a very poor job explaining the important Dreamweaver Layers concept(layers, layout cells, layout tables). Does not tie them together or clearly explain how the user should or should not, use all three of these elements together in the designing of a webpage.This book badly needs to have an underlying webpage project in it so that the author can use it to tie all the important elements together."
2,Beginners only,The Fireworks content is very marginal. The format is good for beginners and easy to follow. Others should find another option.
4,Cherry salad bowl,It is just lovely. I purchased it as a Christmas gift and hope that she likes it as well as I do.
1,Very poor recipes,"The book has great photos of the finished products, but the recipes--at least, the ones I tried--really are terrible. And most of the recipes in the book call for vegetable shortening instead of butter. Shortening gives the cookies a very odd squishy texture and does nothing for the flavor. It's an awful substitute for the nice crumb, richness and flavor that butter provides.I'd stay away from this book--there are so many beautiful collections of great cookie recipes available, there's no need to spend your money on this one."
1,Buy this book if you like to eat sand,"I, like many people here, have found so many ingredient mistakes that the book should have been titled, ""1001 ways to eat crumbs"". I can make cookies blindfolded, but not if I use recipes from this book. I certainly hope that these recipes were editorial mistakes. If not, then Gregg R. Gillespie should have his spatula taken away from him."
4,Gift,"I gave this item as a gift so I'm not sure of the contents of the book, but the condition was good and the shipping fast, I had it in time."
1,Some recipes don't work,"Overall, most recipes in this book are pretty run-of-the-mill. Like an earlier reviewer, I have only been surprised by how unremarkable the cookies are. Finally, I have had the experience with a number of recipes that cooking times and proportions are significantly wrong. I wrote this after one recipe for icing turned out to be a soupy mess, and the sugar cookie dough I had chilling in the fridge was unformable. Go with a different source for cookie recipes."
2,Not so hot...,"I was initially excited at the prospect of so many cookie recipies under one cover, but upon closer perusal, I realized that in spite of the great number of recipes, homogeneity pervades this collection. There are too many variations on the theme (there are multiple versions of many common types of cookies). Also, many of the recipes are just plain bland. The photography is uninspiring (and in some cases, unappetizing). Overall, I was surprised at the lack of originality. There are definitely better cookie cook books out there (a great favorite of mine, although considerably smaller in size, is a spiral-bound collection of cookie recipes published by Land-O-Lakes. It is richly varied, scrupulously accurate, and altogether a pleasure to use.) Unfortunately, I cannot say I would recommend 1000 Cookie Recipes to anyone."
1,"Full of errors, don't waste your money!","I can't believe this ever got published! You can't trust any of the recipes, there are so many errors in amounts. It's obvious no one bothered to proofread it. Save your money."
3,"A good cookbook, with some reservations","I make the Sugar Cookies I with the Buttercream Icing (minus the raw egg yolk) and the Gazelle Horns every Xmas with great results. Also, this is a very good cookie book for people with dietary restrictions such as dairy, eggs, and nuts. I have never seen such a huge variety of cookie recipes that do not contain these ingredients! From reading the other reviews, I agree that some of the recipes are redundant and there is not enough description. Also, I am suspicious of any cookie recipe that uses vegetable shortening instead of real butter, which there are many."
4,Excellent reasource for large volume of recipes,"This book has a lot of pluses. It is easy to read, laid out well, and has a picture of every type of cookie. The recipes in the book are decent recipes, but they are not the best recipe for any particular type of cookie. What I found helpful about this book is that I am sure you have wondered what does 'X' look like, this book does help with those mysteries. This would be a fun book for a bake sale or something where you will get the opportunity to try out a bunch of different cookies."
1,Not Happy with this book!,"I got this book a long time ago, and have been testing different recipes in it over the years. Aside from the typos, overall bland flavors, and similar recipes, I'd just like to say...Has anyone ever tested these recipes before publishing them???So far, I've had many of the recipes fail on me, but nothing like what happened today. I consider myself a seasoned baker-- I do about 13 varieties of Christmas cookies each year-- and something like Mexican Wedding cakes is REALLY HARD TO MESS UP. But it baked for 3 friggin' hours & never actually...baked!Super fed up with this book. For every 1 recipe that is actually a keeper, there are some major bombs or ""meh"" recipes. You can find a better book than this one, and if you can't, just go to foodnetwork.com or cooks.com for your new recipes and avoid the disappointment."
4,"I like it, but haven't used it much","I have to admit I was surprised at the reviews this book got, because I've never had a problem with it. But since I have used it less than 5 times, I guess I just got lucky and picked the 5 good recipes in it! I guess I'll have to keep using it to see if it was really worth it..."
4,Cookies galore,"A great variety of recipes, glad to have the book, it was a staple in a kitchen I baked in years ago. I bake egg free so am usually changing up recipes to adapt to my vegetarian diet. With 1001 recipes I have a lot of options. I like reading similar recipes to pick just the texture...I am looking for. This is actually the 2nd copy I bought from Amazon. The first one smelled like cigarette smoke so I never wanted to open it. This one is in like new condition for the low Amazon price."
5,Perfect Tiki cocktails,This is the end result of research and testing (that must have been rough) into the classical exotica cocktails of the past. I haven't had a bad drink out of this book yet. No corners cut. Many of the drinks have hard-to-find ingredients. But that's the right thing to make the drinks correctly. I can't praise this book enough. It belongs in every Tiki Bar on this fair planet.
3,Interesting but very dramatic,"I am not sure how much of this book is factual. It seems the author is reaching for the ""shock"" factor more so than the Outlaw Bikers. I found the most interesting part to be the description of the individual Angels. I had heard a lot these names, and now I know why. If you can find this book for a decent price, its not a bad read. Just be prepared for the Canadian version of the Angels, because its focused heavily on them."
3,"Beautiful Music, Horrible Balance","I purchased this recording on LP 25 years ago. I loved the music then, and I love it now. The problem with the recording is the lack of balance between the two performers. Ma's playing is emphasized to the point that Cooper is reduced to a mere accompanist rather than being an equal partner. It is as if Ma sits at the very edge of the stage while Cooper and his harpsichord are tucked away in the far rear corner. For this reason, I recommend buying a clean used copy of the CD rather than a new copy."
3,Average Bach value for the money.,"These 'Sonatas for Viola da Gamba & Harpsicord' by Yo-Yo Ma (Cello) and Kenneth Cooper (Harpsichord) seem, to my relatively uneducated ear to be of just average quality compared to the great body of recorded Bach available on DVD.The release is a transfer from an original released on vinyl, so part of the problem may be due to this transfer. I am certain that part of the problem is in the fact that the recording is relatively short as classical DVDs go. A symptom that this is a weakness is the fact that the timings are not even given on the case or the notes.And, as far as Yo-Yo Ma's performance goes, I was much more moved by a five minute snippet of his performance in the second season of 'The West Wing' than I was by the full recording on this disk.I can't help shaking the feeling that his heart wasn't in this one."
1,Whimsically Annoying,"I found Yo-Yo-Ma's interpretation of Bach's Sonata No.2 to be outright silly and without any depth. If you want to hear how this should be played correctly, listen to how Lev Aronson played it on his 1725 Goffriller back in 1971. Everyone wants to take a piece of music and ""make it their own"". Just play it like it is written, with passion, with depth, with understanding and with the intent of doing justice to the composer. Anyone can play notes on a page. My advice to Yo-Yo-Ma and others is to stop playing notes and start playing music. We're all getting tired of it."
5,A page-turning thrill ride,"This was a fantastic read on several levels. The plot alone was worth it, but the premise was totally original and made you think. There was plenty of content (our book club made it a selection and enjoyed the discussion of all the ins and outs of plot and character), but there was also a human dimension that made the whole thing personally engrossing as you follow the characters through intrique into outright danger. I loved it, pure entertainment, and got me thinking about medical scenarios that can be used for evil as well as healing. The plot was particularly interesting considering the poisonings of prominent world characters lately, but the book plot was even more sinister in the ingenious way the bad guys make their power moves."
2,Not a thriller,"I prefer medical thrillers that are actually surprising. This book is not. The plot is about medical greed, a topic about which those inside and outside of medicine are aware."
2,*Yawn*,"I'm sorry, but this book did not hold my attention. I am a nursing student and a total medical junky, but found this book unable to stimulate me intellectually. Maybe I am just too pickey (highly likely). It is not a poorly written book by any means, but I am a person who thrives on books which stimulate my critical thinking abilities, and, frankly, this just didn't cut it. Couldn't rouse myself to finish the book...sorry."
3,Good armory reference,"Mr. Volkmann does a good job of trying to explain the basics of fencing in this text. I do find it a bit disorganized at times, the parts on epee and sabre fencing are interspersed and hidden within the general foil sections. The use of french rather than english terminology can also lead one to confusion. It is a small-run book, crudely printed and bound, which takes away from its real strong suit as an armory reference. This book's best content is its detailed wiring diagrams and schematics. It even includes a plan for building a fencing dummy. Worth having in your library for that alone."
2,14' s49 chain,i barely made it through one dead pine tree and the chain was dull. are these factory seconds? something was bad with mine right out of the package
5,12/14 Low Profile Chain,"Amazon quick turn around to exchange 12"" instead 12/14 (wrong size) in next business day.I decided to buy 3 more garden products from Amazon (better price than HD/Sears/Lowe's plus free shipping). There is no problem at all.Great communication, follow up and quick shipmentThanks."
4,A must have for children of all ages,"Shame it wasn't cleaned-up more. Often the video comes across as a very clean/excellent recording from an SP mode VHS cassette, instead of a DVD. It appears barely any work was done to the picture and sound; little effort was put into and video or sound (re)mastering. Still the content and quality of the show is excellent, and the collection is far from poor in appearance...Still wish more 'love' was put into it though.The series is well worth the money spent and is highly recommended for purchase. Hopefully, a Blu-Ray ""cleaned-up"" version will be made down the road. This series deserves a 5-star treatment and restoration."
5,The Place To Be,"I have to admit that this collection really took me back to childhood memories. Pee Wee's antics were very lively and created a playful atmosphere around the Playhouse. Randy, to me, was the funniest character amongst the friends of the Playhouse. The classic scene was when they all decided to organize a daily newspaper and as always Randy wanted to add is own spicy creative ideas. The collection went for a great price. Even came with the bonus Christmas special DVD. Knowing entertainment is realizing what a hilarious show that Pee Wee's Playhouse presents."
5,Childhood memeories!,I saw this item on sale and talked my self out of buying it. I ended up kicking myself later until I found a better deal here on Amazon and snagged it.The packaging is very nice; it'd make a great gift.Brings back tons of memories and was actually still entertaining to watch. I was surprised that my 10 year old sister even picked up on it which is saying a lot.I had no defective disks as others have had issues with. Everything worked fine.
2,Do nothing heating up my tank,The heat emitted is really limited. Only can warm your turtles up within 20cm distance. So regret buying the bulb now I have to return it.
3,Not very warm,"I bought this product for my birds ( Cockatiel & Lovebird) for their cage to help keep them warm. I read other reviews and thought it might be a good idea since my home is kind of cold and the cockatiel doesn't want to go into any of the fleece beds/houses I've provided him. It takes awhile to warm up, and once warm it does really warm them up too much, but I do have a blanket I put over their cage to help hold in the heat. If you're buying for your bird cage, I would recomment maybe the 100 watt bulb instead of the 60 watt ( which I bought ) I think this product would work great for reptiles in like a glass tank, but it's not so good for a 4ft tall x 3ft acrossed bird cage."
1,Bad Experience...,Poor quality - stopped working after about 2 weeks of night use only. Considering it was a 60W bulb I expected a life-span that would come closer at least a year(considering they advertise 5-years). All I have now is a paperweight with a jingle (the loose filament).
3,Don't count on the hours,We don't keep the bulb on constantly and we did not get the hours mentioned. We only used ours for 5 months and now purchased a new one. We use it to keep our bird warm during the winter months.
4,better than illuminated heat lamp bulbs.,"This emitter is great, It has improved the heating temperature of my terrarium by about 10F over the previous red bulb and moon lamp bulbs I was using. I use it with a lamp that has an adjustable dimmer, and provides great control over the amount of heat I want from this emitter.I live in CO where it does get cold, and I don't even need to crank this to 100% to obtain the ideal temperature.The only small negative is that it is hard to tell if it is on or not if your lamp does not have any visual indication that it is on or off, since this does not provide any visual feedback and does not light up like a traditional bulb."
4,Great trip planning resource,"Once of the few places I've found information on the above ground options at Carlsbad.It's given me many alternatives to the Guadelupe Peak, McKittrick Canyon, caves trip I was planning. There seems to be much more to be explored.Maps and photos are a bit unclear - could use some work"
3,spots and stripes are to big,The paper is good but the spots and the stripes are to big and don't look like the real thing when folded in to an animal.
1,"Horrible, Save Yourself","Impossible Discounts is a horrible company to deal with. The L'oreal Dermo-Expertise kit they sent me was disgusting. The item description said brand new, but the product that arrived at my doorstep was clearly used. The tamper prevention seal on the flap of the box was already broken, and the box was old and grimy and looked like it had been handled a lot. Needless to say, I sent the product back, but Impossible Discounts refused to give a full refund of my purchase total. I caution anyone who plans to do business with Impossible Discounts. This company has zero integrity and horrible customer service."
3,LOreal Dermo-Expertise Anti-Aging Review,I like this product but I don't believe the peel is strong enough for me personally. I am used to getting stronger peels at salons. Still it leaves the skin with a nice glow and it feels good while using it.
3,"Cheap, but i don't prefer this","Used as instructed - 3 times a week. However, after couple of full face treatments, developed a sore rash around eyes, redness and inflamation. Eyes becames sore and dry -stopped using. I didn't contacted l'Oreal. Few days later worse, face hot and burning, rash progressed down face. Eyes became painful.Some how i'm gud. It might not fit for some skins. Just beaware when you buying some of these kind of products which may or may not fit for all"
3,Fine as Far as It Goes; There's a Better Value Out There,"This is one of the premiere recordings and performances in the entire classical canon. But for barely double the price you could get the Gould State of Wonder set, which includes Gould's 1955 and 1981 recordings of the Goldbergs; an engaging interview of Gould by Tim Page, in which Gould analyzes his performances of the Goldbergs; and a selection of outtakes. The three-disc State of Wonder is by far the better value.I should mention that on my disc of this 1981 recording, the entire thing is one track. Gould did this, supposedly, to keep people from dipping in and out of the performance, to listen to it all in one session. I've since seen a version of this disc that didn't do that. Whether it's one track or 32 is mostly irrelevant but I'm putting the information out there anyway.Bottom line: Pass on this disc, buy State of Wonder instead."
1,Defective CDs,I received a defective CD and returned it for another. The second CD was also defective - beware.
1,Not what Bach wrote folks!,"The so called Goldberg Variations is one of the greatest works ever composed for the keyboard. But keyboard in Bach' s time meant a harpsichord, a VERY different instrument from the modern piano. If you wouldn' t dream of hearing the Hammerklavier Sonata in an electric organ, why contradict Bach' s intentions? There is a quite marvelous recording of this work in the OPUS111 label with Pierre Hantai. This recording won the Gramophone award for best baroque recording. I am sure Bach would be very happy with recording, whereas Gould...."
1,Sing Along with Glenn,"Gould's hum-along with Bach is not acceptable to me. I want to hear one of the most important piano compositions in history unaccompanied, unadulterated by Gould's eccentric voice duet. How anyone can write a review of this CD without warning the potential purchaser of this factor is beyond me and I think a disservice."
2,Avoid this recording,"I was intensely disappointed by the CD edition of this famous and superb performance of the Goldberg Variations. The engineering cut off the phrasing at the end of each musical phrase. This abrupt clipped ending is not what was originally played by Glen Gould, as I have the original vinal with which to compare it. I hated this mutilation of the musical phrasing done by whoever remastered this recording. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???My recommendation, avoid this dog."
2,The humming ruins it,"This may very well be the best interpretation of Bach's Goldberg Variations ever... but it's difficult to give it a fair appraisal because of Glenn Gould's incessant humming, la-la-la'ing and attempts at singing during each piece. And it's not just an occasional extraneous soft noise in the background, either. Sometimes his voice is almost as loud as the piano. It ruins the whole effect for me. How on earth did he manage to convince a record producer to release it like this? It's horrible. Do yourself a favor - skip this version and get Wilhelm Kempff's, Simone Dinnerstein's or Murray Perahia's instead. Each of them is a great interpretation of Bach's Goldberg Variations... and each of them puts a bit different spin on these beautiful works of art. And if you really want to push the envelope, listen to Christiane Jaccottet's harpsichord version. But the best part is that there isn't any humming, la-la-la'ing or singing to get in the way of the music."
1,Unbelievable arrogance,"I listened to this disk for the first time on headphones in the middle of the night and couldn't believe my ears. If Bach had wanted a vocal accompanient he would have scored one. I found it impossible to enjoy the undoubtedly skilled piano playing due to the ""sing along"" Gould decided to add to this recording. I'd definitely go for his earlier recording of these variations."
2,One Boring CD,"I love Classical Music - if played with life - the music was played to perfection - but, without one once of life.Bored me to tears."
1,Absurdly over rated,the constant ridiculous 'humming' of Gould is not only unbearably annoying but unbearably self indulgent.How anyone can ignore it is beyond me
2,Stop that humming!,"I had heard that this was one of the quintessential recordings of the Goldberg Variations, and that in combination with the 1955 recording one could truly appreciate the transformation of Gould and his appreciation, understanding and interpretation of the Goldberg Variations with age. All that is true.I had also heard that Gould hums with the music, but that the humming is not a distraction. He certainly does hum, but to this listener it is a tremendous distraction. He doesn't even hum on key! Either they should have explored tricks in the engineering to eliminate the humming from the recording, or they should have titled it ""Glenn Gould Hums the Goldberg Variations (with piano accompaniment by Glenn Gould)."""
2,Ooops...,...I forgot this is the one where the idiot actually hums aloud while he's playing.Ten dollars down the drain.Oh well...
5,exciting and quintessential gould!,I think this is gould at his best. The goldberg variations are sharp and fast-moving while at the same time there is a cohesiveness that makes you follow along at the same pace...it's amazing and one of the best pieces of music I have.
3,Good read but.....,"Most reviews submitted are friends of the author or work for him. This makes their reviews a bit unfair to the rest of the reading world. However, the book was well written and interesting. I love Reagan and always enjoy reading about him. It's interesting to see from an insider's point of view."
5,Almost too beautiful,"I am not your typical LOTR fan. I watched the movie without having read the books. Still, the movie made an impression on me. Several months later, I read the trilogy, then watched the movie for a second time. Afterwards, I was so moved that I bought the CD. I was not disappointed--this soundtrack is incredible! It deserved to win an Oscar for best score. The only problem is that I can't study while it's on. It's so beautiful that it brings the movie back to life and makes me want to cry. Still, I absolutely love it--so haunting and beautiful."
2,Too repetitive,"I love classical music. I love Wagner. His way to extract leitmotives that seems deeply inside all Western Culture. Well, here Shore in the movies tries to achive something like that. Simply wonderfull music. But not in this album ... so repetitive, lacking variety ... just 2 or 3 themes (the fellowship and Frodo's themes) repeated once, twice ... until you sell the CD. If you want Lord of the rings music, and I urge you to buy and treasure, ""my preciouss reader"", buy the others. No important music is missed, for there all the important themes that appear here also are present, mixed with newer ones."
3,VERY DISAPPOINTING.....,"IF YOU LIKE CHOIR MUSIC YOU SHOULD LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK. I PERSONALLY DO NOT CARE FOR IT. THERE WERE TWO TRACKS I REALLYENJOYED 2. CONCERNING HOBBITS, AND 17. THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP. BUT EVEN THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP HAS TO HAVE SINGING IN IT. I FEEL PETER JACKSON WOULD HAVE MADE A MUCHWISER CHOICE HAD HE ASKED DAVID ARKENSTONE TO WRITE AND CONDUCTTHE SOUNDTRACK. THE SYMPHONY ""THE LORD OF THE RINGS"" BY JOHAN DE MEIJ IS SUPERIOR TO THIS SOUNDTRACK. I HAVE, I THINK, ALL THE MUSIC ENSPIRED BY THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND MIDDLE EARTH ON THE MARKET THUS FAR, AND TO ME THIS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE WESTWIND ENSEMBLE CD, IS ONE OF THE POORER ENTRIES........."
1,I am not stealing this CD!,"All I want to do is listen to the music that I purchased - but I cant, this mess is locked up as a shockwave flash file. Thanks - God forbid that I should be able to access the content that I paid for. This CD wont work on any of my many computers. Dont buy this mess, pirate the material instead, God knows that after having purchased the CD I have to go find a hacked version. You Producers are idiots."
1,Dissapointed,"I was VERY dissapointed in this soundtrack. The film was wonderful and the score was excellent during the film...but on it's own I found it lacking the intense feelings that were evident during the movie. Many soundtracks are able to pull this off (Star Wars, NeverEnding Story, etc) but Lords fell WAYYY short."
2,It's not that good,"I have listened to this CD several times now and while it is good, it isn't that good. There is way too much choral music and the heavy hand in the orchestration can make it depressing. Enya's music on this album sounds like stuff from her old album. Fusion jazz or something lighter would have been better."
1,WARNING:,"If you are planning of listening to this CD on your PC, don't bother because it won't play it."
5,awesome soundtrack for an awesome movie of an awesome book,"I must say that everything about the new Lord of the Rings movie is totally awesome, and the soundtrack was a huge contribution. Every piece of music perfectly matched the scene it was set for. Every piece was completely original and flowed well. Howard Shore proved once again that he can interpret a movie with grace as well as precision.Many people I know have compared this soundtrack to that of Star Wars Episode One, but I for one have to say that Williams' work is nothing compared to this. I mean, let's face it; John Williams hasn't done anything original or completely noteworthy in the past decade."
3,I can't believe no one has mentioned..,"the presense of Liz Fraser on this soundtrack. The song 'Lothlorien' perfectly captures the underlying haunting mood of the film, and by FAR out-paces Enya's over-played, over-hyped vocal meanderings."
5,Lord of the Rings soundtrack,"This soundtrack follows the scenes in the movie. Superbly digitally enhanced music. If you like the movie, you'll love the soundtrack."
2,Not Really Worth the Money,"Some parts are fine, but there is no strong, recognizable theme to the music. The hobbit's song sounds like an attempt at a theme, but it certainly isn't something memorable. The whole soundtrack sounds like a collage of some of the more famous movie music. The music fits well with the movie, but independently it isn't nearly as good."
5,GREAT SOUNDTRACK,"This is the ideal soundtrack. Whatever traits you believe make up an ideal soundtrack, this one has all of them, and I mean it. This is unbelievably entertaining to listen to; you will be in a euphoria for hours after hearing this wonderful collection of music."
5,The Lord of the Rings:Fellowship of the Ring,I loved it the music and it is helping me to learn to play the songs.
5,Enchanting Music,"Unlike some of the prior reviews that I have read, I thought the music was not ""a Troll-sized Disappointment"" but very well done. I have seen the movie 3 times, and a lot of the music in the movie showed up on the CD. Granted, they couldn't put three hours of music onto a CD (they could, but I doubt it would meet customer satisfaction), and had to cut it down some. One thing I noticed is that you could figure out the exact moment in the scene when listening to the music. It's very distinct and I would (and have) reccommended it to many people."
2,Nothing special!!!,"I have bought this soundtrack hopefully,but...COnan the Barbarian is still much more better....nothing special, all the tracks are similar, the new song performed by Enya is nothing compared to Book of Days or Orinoco Flow....Bad soundtrack"
2,A Typical Hollywood Mistake,"The music is only fair, a tad bit uninspired in a few places at best. The majesty and archaic grandeur of Tolkien's masterpiece has been sucked dry by this all too average musical rendering.A far better choice for the music for this film would have been the German rock band Blind Guardian, who are notorious for basing their music upon all of Tolkien's works, not just ""The Lord Of The Rings."" Take for instance some songs: ""Journey Through The Dark,"" (same subject as the comparable track on this disc), ""The Lord of the Rings,"" (would have made a great opening sequence, based around the little poem inscripted on the Ring), and countless other tunes.The director and all the publicity folks for this flick goofed up big-time."
2,Could Have Been A Much Better Score ...,"If they'd hired John Barry or Jerry Goldsmith for the job. In fact, themes from Out of Africa and The Mummy was heard all over. The [amt] million was wasted."
5,Wow,"Majestic. This score is amazing. The album comes with different covers, I got the one with Saruman because Christopher Lee is the man. I have the whole Star Wars trilogy soundtrack and this, I must say is sort of the opposite of Star Wars. This stuff is grand, epic, yet doesn't constantly use charecter and place themes like Star Wars does. It realy teers at the emotions, and is subtle, yet strong when it has to be, amazing vocal works as well, the last song features disarming vocals by Enya, I doubt anyone will want to get up right after the movie ends. Anyway quit reading this and get it!"
5,My son's favorite music!,Thanks for great response - great product - exact replacement for what had been stolen from us while on vacation!
5,Simply outstanding!,"This is one of the best movie soundtracks I have ever listened to. So many that come out today seem like they just pick songs from whatever bands are popular at the moment. This soundtrack is one of those rare gems that not only enhances the movie, but stands very well on its own. You can feel the emotional highs and lows throughout. The soundtrack is mostly orchestral with some choral elements scattered throughout. Its varied pace and emotional content (fast, slow, happy, sad, spooky, etc.) keep it interesting. My one and only complaint is about track 13, ""The Bridge of Khazad Dum."" It is too short! Or rather they cut it off too soon. To me it is one of the most emotional parts of the soundtrack/movie, but if you compare it with the movie, they left off a good 30 seconds at the end of that track. What a shame to lose such a beautiful part."
5,Greatest CD Ever!!!!,"This is a wonderful CD! If you have seen the movie, this is just as good!There is 2 songs by Enya, and they are wonderful! If you are a fan of Enya's get this NOW!!!!You can also put it into your computer, and it will take you to this website that has cooooool stuff. Like loads of Enya's pictures, the cast, and more. So you must be online to do so!So get it!!!!!"
5,Easy to Listen to,"The Lord of the Rings soundtrack have a wide variety of themes, from heavy brass to dainty flutes. If you enjoy modern orchestral music, with some choral additions, this is a good buy for you."
5,A perfect match of composer and film,"A friend of mine recently said he was surprised John Williams (""Star Wars,"" ""Superman,"" etc.) didn't compose the music for this movie. I had to disagree. While I'm as big a Williams fan as they come, I found Howard Shore's score the perfect match. The exciting parts were thunderous, the quiet parts were gentle -- there wasn't a single misstep in this composition.As good as Williams is, I don't think his style would have treated the softer moments of this movie with the elegance Shore did -- in ""Concerning Hobbits"" there is a brief violin snippet that that still resonates in my mind a month after first seeing the movie. In fact, it was that snippet that made me decide to purchase the album.In other words, it's perfect. Pick it up."
4,Great on music but...,"It's great music to listen to when you want to replay the movie scenes in your mind. The music really reflects the action in the movie. My complaint lies with the cover. After having spent twice the amount, as compared to an ordinary CD, I thought some kind of artwork from the film will be featured on the cover. The red, mock-leather cover is too plain."
3,Would be much better if I'd seen the movie,"I bought this CD because what I'd previously heard of Howard Shore's work sounded interesting and because Enya has two songs on the CD as well. Mr. Shore's work is good but you should see the movie first, it would probably help your enjoyment of the CD. Of his tunes I think I preferred #2 Concerning Hobbits and #17 The Breaking of the Fellowship most. I found it interesting that Enya, with only two songs on the CD, actually seems to have more visible billing here. May it Be is probably a lttle better than The Council of Elrond, I think it is the one she sang at the Oscars."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"Howard Shore had an immense undertaking for this project, and his final score is decent. The dark and ominous themes for full orchestra and chorus are effective in the movie, though somewhat contrived an un-original. Speaking of un-orginial, the other famous themes have their origins elsewhere as well. The triumphant Fellowship Theme can be heard during football season as the NFL Sunday Night TV theme. Crack open a hymnal and find ""This is My Father's World,"" whose first phrase is lifted directly for the Hobbit's theme.Aside from those disappointing steals, Shore does a good job with the background music to this movie. I would recommend this to fans of the movie, but not fans of original motion picture music. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible at all. However, I would not call this Academy-Award winning material by any means. Just a pretty good album."
1,THE LORD OF THE RINGS C.D.,"THE MUSIC WASN'T WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO LISTEN TO IT BEFORE WRITING. THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BUY C.D.'S WITHOUT HEARING THE MUSIC FIRST. THE SERVICE WAS SATISFACTORY, HOWEVER. SHARON BREEN"
2,Disappointed,"As much as I loved the music while watching the movie, the soundtrack is disappointing. It's very repetitive and after a while, it gets annoying listening to the same themes over and over."
3,"Good music, bad ""interactive"" PC [stuff]","The music was very good. Overall, i would give the music 5 stars. fits the music very well. However, if I could actually listen to the music on my PC, it would be great (which is why it only gets 3 stars) My computer does not even recognize that there is music on the CD. It only loads some webpage that you can watch enya interviews and whatever but there is nothing on the CD that actually lets you listen to the music. Considering that my computer is my primary CD player here, that just takes all the fun out of having the CD"
5,Enya rocks,This is an awesome cd the battle songs are great it has an awesome main theme and enya is one of my favorite singer!!!!!!
4,Wonderful,"The cd relates the movie through sound and emotion. Although very few words are on the cd the mood it brings with fear, love, and advanture, will allow anyone to fall in love with The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy."
4,Powerful score for great movie,"While not on the level of a Titanic soundtrack or the best of John Williams, Howard Shore creates a richly textured background to the epic Lord of the Rings. Along with 2 Enya pieces, this soundtrack conveys a sense of a time long gone with celtic references from our own history. Well worth listening to."
2,broken case,I love the music of the lord of the rings but the case that the cd came in was totally broken and can not be used.
5,Great!,This cd was very powerful. The movie played out in my head whenever I put the cd in my cd player. The orchestra did an outstanding job!!!
5,The Lord of the Rings: The Score of the Ring,"Excellent! The Beautiful score from the wonderful movie, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."
1,Where is the RING THEME?,"When I first listened to this CD I was immediately shocked and dismayed that it doesn't begin with the music that the film begins with, the Ring Theme. Listening all the way through I was disgusted to discover that a version of the Ring Theme only graces the last 20 seconds of track 15. AND THAT'S IT!! Now the film boasts a rich and complex set of themes, so there's still plenty of material to fill out the disk. But this error in judgment (or whatever it is) should not be overlooked. I give this CD one star to call attention to what I judge to be an unforgivable screw up."
3,Meditation music,"Works well in the movie, but listening to the soundtrack doesn't take you back to those scenes as it's playing. Worth keeping around for something to listen to while relaxing in a hot bath, reading the book, and sipping a glass of wine."
5,Very good music!,"I think ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring"" is a GREAT CD. The music is well composed. I really like the song at the end of the CD called ""May It Be"" performed by Enya. I love the music as well as the words. It's a great song. If you liked to movie, then you need the soundtrack. I listen to this music when I'm on the computer all the time on our music downloader. I just bought this CD at Best Buy today along with the ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" CD. If you have the first one, I also recommend the second one! Happy listening!"
4,Very good.... but not the best,"I am a long time Lord of the Rings fan, and I have been waiting for these movies, and this soundtrack for quite some time. This soundtrack shocked me at first, as I was not expecting such dark overtones to most of the score. The chorals were well done, and the a good deal of the music was fairly original. Durring the song ""Concerning Hobbits"", I could just picture a little hobbit, in his chair, blowing smoke rings in mid afternoon. To anyone who enjoys a good, energetic, and even exciting score, this is a MUST have. Very strong score, from a very good composer... but again, it is not the best out there."
4,somber darkly romantic,"I picked this up because I love Shore's work for David Cronenberg, such as Videodrome and Dead Ringers. This is by far the most epic and classically inspired score he's done. Not as experimental as Crash or even his music for the Cell but majestic and inspiring. I don't get the knee jerk ""its like John Williams"" critique, but a touch of Wagner never hurt anyone. However if you want the best of Shore find the elusive ""Music for the Films of David Cronenberg"" cd."
5,this beauty is criminal,"another gem from suzanne vegathe depth and production values are, as usual, superbi definite must for suzanne's fan baseand not a bad first exposure to her genius, either"
4,Please stay...,"What a lovely expressive voice, great listening. Very artsy and relaxing...as good as her previous creations..."
3,I do love her but...,i've heard these songs before in different guises. Having said that she never fails to take me on a journey and I haven't stopped playing it since it arrived. Her masterful lyrics and the measured tone of her voice reveal more with each play.
5,Sounds Better With every Listen,"This is the kind of music that seems to get better the more it's listened to. While I'm a big fan of Suzanne Vega and her music is instantly recognizable to me, I had hoped for a trailblazer. All of the songs are very reminiscent of something she's recorded before. Perhaps this is due to the small group she's using which can easily perform everything live on the road. The accordion was a nice touch on a previous CD. Maybe she can throw in a brass section (a la The Beatles, ""Got to Get You into My Life"" ) or use a few more exotic instruments, e.g., a sitar, on future projects."
2,Disjointed/slightly muffled audio quality,"I liked the music when I auditioned it on Amazon through my tiny computer speakers. When I received the CD in the mail and played it on my high end system, the vocals seemed to be a little mufffled and came from behind the instruments. Instrumentals sounded ok, nothing to write about. If you own an old Sade CD and this one, play them one after another and you'll see the difference a good recording and mixing can make! I'm relegating this CD for the car stereo, hopefully it sounds ok there."
5,Really really solid experimental noise/dark ambient release.,"I'll start this review with the first and last lines of the far more reputable than I critic review site of AllMusic:""Without any discernible melody or rhythm, Firmament III continues Main's evolution beyond music into something much more like sound design. ... Let's just say that all of this stuff is really out there, but not beyond the reach and appreciation of your average art and experimental rock fan.""Does this pique your interest? If so, then buy this CD. The price can't be beat here at Amazon for the used copies (currently just over $1.00). This is really heady and yet somehow accessible electronic noise with a dark ambient tinge to it. There is also a solid beat that can be found beneath it all.For the price of a used CD you cannot afford to miss this release if you're interested in experimental/noise/ambient music."
4,So Many Things to Do...,"Philly Dogs have More Fun is a comprehensive source of local attraction information for the dog and it's owner. The book is organized intelligently by region - giving travelers an easy way to lessen the scope of their search for fun and dog-friendly places to visit.Armen is careful to specify in what capacity dogs are received at each of the many parks, cafes, museums and other attractions. It is doubtful that even Philadelphians are aware of just how many attractions there are in their area. The open and personable approach to the subject has me ready to explore both on and off the beaten paths of Philly.Perhaps the only area of improvement would be in the index which could have been more detailed."
5,Full of great information!,"I am really enjoying this book a lot (and so is my dog, of course). I have lived here for years but had no idea that I could take my dog to so many different places in the area--and I didn't know that some great places even existed, like a dog bakery (which we have already visited!). With summer approaching, I am looking forward to taking day trips to places that not only will be interesting and fun for me but will also enable me to give my dog some exercise in a new place. I also think that it is very helpful to know which hotels allow dogs to stay, in case I want to make it a longer visit, and the appendices are full of things I didn't know about--like dog resorts, which I know my dog will be eager to try! It's obvious that a huge amount of research went into this book, and I think the author did a great job. And my dog wants to know how she ever lived without it!"
4,Great book and resource!,"I found this book to be very helpful and full of useful information, as have several friends that also purchased the book. Through it, I have learned about many dog-related events that I never knew existed in the Philadelphia area, and I have also found it very helpful that the book indicates which restaurants are willing to provide water and special treats for my dogs. All in all, the comprehensive listing of dog-welcoming events, stores, restaurants, parks and places in different areas and neighborhoods of Philadelphia is exactly what I was looking for. My dogs and I are enjoying it very much!"
1,Basic mumbo jumbo,"I was excited to receive this book - I love learning about how other users master the techniques of Photoshop. Boy was I disappointed! I've seen these illustrations before - rehashed and rehashed - and if you're using Photoshop CS or CS2, don't waste your time. If you're still working with Photoshop 4 and have never done a collage, I guess you should buy this book. although you'll learn more on Adobe's tutorial website than you'll learn from this book!"
2,Like so many other,"The book is a collections of various graphic artist's works that use photoshop to montage. If you do model work and/or work in advertising, you might find it useful. I was underwhelmed especially when I realized that the one artist's piece I identified with was used for the cover and nothing else was like it."
4,Good insights,"This book provides great insight into the process behind the work. It is especially interesting to see how the artists found inspiration in unusual places, such as the use of a stone wall for the texture on the cover work that looks like parchment. It does not go into the microsop details of how each piece was built, but it is a great introduction to the style and shows how to accomplish a lot.A couple of the pieces are mediocre at best, but better than I could have done, so they are still interesting and educational."
2,They aren't kidding when they say extra small.,"I bought this not knowing the measurements of the toy since they were not listed in the description and there were no reviews. This is the smallest dog toy I have ever seen. It is literally 1 1/2"" wide X 4"" long. I am concerned on it being a chocking hazard for my dog, especially the removable squeaker which is only an inch across. I have a small Boston Terrier (11 lbs) and this toy is way too tiny for her. However the concept is a good idea and the packaging and material is nice. They should just be more specific on their sizes!"
1,Extremely disappointed,"I just purchased this neat little feeder. Interesting concept and design, but it doesn't work. I filled the feeder and it hasn't stopped leaking. There is a steady drip from the flowers, so now instead of feeding hummers, I am feeding ants. This is the second Birdscapes feeder I have purchased, the first being the Model 8110-3 which is a pretty copper-and-glass feeder. I bought it because it was so pretty, but it too leaked and made a big mess, then the beautiful ""copper"" corroded and it wasn't so pretty anymore. Think I'll be avoiding this brand from now on.Birdscapes 219 Helix Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder, 16 oz capacity"
4,The hummers love it!,"The hummers love this feeder. I have quite a few hummingbird feeders out and can have as many as 20 hummingbirds at a time. They favor the ones that they hover at much more than the ones that they sit at. This feeder holds enough that I don't have to fill it more than once a day and it is easy to clean. Other people have complained that it leaks horribly. This happened to me once, but I took the feeder all apart, including the bottom section where the spring is and when I put it back together it was fine. Something must have been loose. Sometimes I will see drips of nectar beneath it on my porch, but no more than some other feeders. Overall, the hummers love it, so I love it."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","Although marketed as ""drip-free"", it pours! No matter how I try to make it work, it leaks like a sieve. It's a waste of money, a waste of nectar, and it creates a mess."
1,Achitectual Graphic Standards,The reprsentation was not clear this is a reproduction of a 1935 published book. This is not usefull in todays building enviroment.
1,"Be careful, this is the 1932 edition!","I bought this book thinking that it was the recent version, but it's a reissue of the 1932 edition! The publishing date is 1998 and the title makes no mention of the antiquated material. This book is an interesting historical work but is useless as a contemporary reference. Make sure you get the ""10th Edition"" published in 2000 if you want the recent one. I'm trying to return my 1932 antique now."
1,Disappointed from Texas,If I had read some of the reviews I would never had purchased the book. When I looked at it closely I realized that it was something I really couldn't use because it did not include the up to date building requirements. If the title shown had mentioned 1932 edition it would have helped in my decsion whether to purchase the book or not. One thing I learned was that I need to check and double check before I purchase.
5,THE BOMB,"I work on Revit designing classical architectural structures, some for fun and others for actual construction. This book is a must for understanding and remembering the old techniques. I have tried many books. This one is my favorite."
3,A cute book,"This tiny book looks like a children's book, and actually, the author's outlook is a bit naive and child-like (a good thing). I enjoyed her stories, but the book is somewhat forgettable."
2,NO GO,"This is very pretty but over all a bad product! Ours started leaking right away so now that makes the item totally worthless, had to toss it in the trash."
5,Great for kids!,"I bought one of the boy and girl Eureka kids sleeping bags and my kids love them. I can say that they seem to be rated appropriately for temp. They come with a stuff sack and fit pretty easily if you roll them tight. The length is such that they could probably use them until they are 10-12. Overall, very pleased with the purchase and so are my kids."
3,Nice but....,"I did read other reviews and took in consideration my son's size (he is 10 y/o, 4' 4"" and 60 lbs)....but wished now I would have just bought an adult size sleeping bag. This one is perfect...if he was, maybe 6. The length is not a problem but if he is to sleep in it zipped up, it's a pretty slim fit. Maybe it's suppose to be that way? Anyway, overall a great sleeping bag but me being me , he will keep it till the summer, then I will buy a full size one."
2,not practical for every day use,"I got this bag (purple one) for my daughter to use at nap time at preschool. I found it hard to get into the bag. Also, the washing instructions say to hand wash or put it in an industrial washer, neither of which are practical when it gets sent home once a week for washing. Perhaps it is OK for less regular use like camping, but it also says not to store it in the bag, which seem ridiculous to me."
2,Sleeping Bag,"This sleeping bag appeared to be nice; however, returned it due to the difference in how it looked compared to the picture. We ordered it because of the yellow since our son likes that color--but the yellow was much less than what was shown on the picture."
1,misleading product info,"Note this is not a rating for the item. If I wasn't mad as h*ll, I would have thought this was some kind of bad joke. The seller (diapers.com) advertized the item as a pack of six. I ordered two packs and the seller sent just two boxes (which i could have purchased in a grocery store for a lot less). The product description was probably an error, unless it was an intentional misrepresentation. Please do your DD before you order."
3,Did not really take a liking to them,We bought the pack of 6 almost six months ago for our baby boy and we had to give most of them away; he (surprisingly) did not really take a liking to them. It was rather unfortunate.
2,Too sweet.,"These cookies are a lot sweeter than I expected. My 17 month old spits them out. Even when I eat them, I get a sugar zing. Wish we had tried one box before ordering a pack of 6."
4,"Fun and unique, but really only a must for hardcore fans....","The Glory Days of Wrestling is an odd mixture of matches, movie shorts, and other oddities that wrestling offers from years gone by. It's certainly fun to see how things were done 40 years ago, and this DVD collection has all kinds of stars from yesteryear (Haystacks Calhoun, Gorgeous George, Verne Gagne, etc...). Plus, you really haven't lived until you see a 1970s midget woman's wrestling match.Having said that, this is not going to appeal to everybody. The matches themselves are all old school, and will probably not be enjoyed by modern day WWE/TNA fans (low production values, the women are not walking barbie dolls, and little high flying action). However, if you are a die hard wrestling nut (or a person who remembers these guys fighting) - check it out.By the way, I'm not sure what the one review was talking about when it describes a documentary - there is nothing like that on here."
5,You can't go wrong with this!,"This CD is perfect for all levels of singers. I purchased two others from this manufacturer. We love them all because of the beat, tempo and speed of the words and music on the screen! If you like old country then this is for you."
4,Greatest Songs of Classic Country,"A good selection of country music backing,and on screen lyrics if required, it incudes a mix of male/female songs to choose from, and delivery from the States was no problem."
3,Classic Country,This is a great set of classic country songs but after I received it I waited quite awhile before I tried them out and on the disc #1 the words were all scrambled where you could not make out what they were but other than that the other two were great.
1,Not sure what is wrong but......,"I'm not sure what is wrong but there are no lyrics on the screen. The music is there, the graphics are there, the lyrics are not. Maybe it would work properly in a Karaoke player but it sure does not work in a PC or a DVD player. Very upset."
2,TOO SWEET FOR ME,They are way too rich and sweet for me. They are not healthy. It is ok to eat them once in a while.
4,Wonderful cookies,"Light and crisp - wonderful flavor, but not many cookies in the package. I will buy again"
5,Perfect for every occasion!,"I added these to our adult children's Easter baskets.They truly enjoyed them. The taste is light, crisp, and totally delicious.I plan on using the rest at a tea party and as hostess gifts. :)"
5,"Yes, I ate one whole box as one serving (8 cookies)","over the course of one day while at my work desk. As other reviewers noted, they are light, buttery and delicious! I'm using the second box for homemade (sorta') ice crem sandwiches. They are so tasty they really are fine plain. Now I wished I had ordered several cases when they were on sale for $12, but maybe then I'd eat too many."
4,"A little too sweet, but kids love it",Slightly expensive biscuits but Kids love them because they are really sweet. The adults love them too! Very fresh and crispy.
4,WOW,Perfect and cheap racquet with a little lead tape (mostly at grip) became a powerfull and very control racket.must a try.............
2,Buy From Manufacturer,"DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIN FOR THE MAKITA UC4030A CHAINSAW. IT WILL NOT FIT. The Makita UC4030A chainsaw is product specific for its parts and only a chain sold by the manufacture will fit on the saw. Go to the Makita website and seek out replacement parts for this specific chainsaw. Sure, the chain will cost more,and it takes Makita five to ten working days to get it in the mail and out to you. However, it'll save you from being set up to fail, when you need a chain the most."
4,"Nice chain, but not for Makita UC4030A","This is a well made, pre-lubricated chain and would probably work extremely well on a compatible chainsaw. Unfortunately I bought it for the Makita UC4030A electric chainsaw and it does not fit (too much slack). Oregon does say that this chain is compatible with the previous model of that saw (Makita UC4000) and that may be true but it is *NOT* the right size for the Makita UC4030A. Unfortunately Amazon *still* lists the S58 as a compatible item with the UC4030A saw in the form of the ""frequently bought with"" recommendation.Don't make the mistake I (and many other Amazon shoppers made). If you want a replacement chain for the Makita UC4030A saw, then get theOregon S56 16-Inch Semi Chisel Chain Saw Chain. The S56 is Oregon's recommendation for a replacement chain for the Makita UC4030, and I've tested it and confirmed that it fits perfectly."
1,Doesn't fit Makita UC4030A Chain saw,This saw chain is shown on the same page as the Makita UC4030A Chain Saw so i figured it would fit the saw. Of course it doesn't and I had to return it. Whoever puts these web pages together for Amazon need to make sure the assessories shown with the main item actually work with that item. What a waste of time!!
1,Does not fit makita--do not rely on manufacturer claim,"Simply put, too long for my makita uc4000 so I can not use it. Very annoying experience. Manu data says it does fit, but it is wrong."
1,A little too big,"I am using a Makita UC4030A and ordered this chain as it was recommended with the purchase of the Chain Saw. When I needed to replace the original chain this one was a bit too long. The 1 star is not for the quality of the item but just for the fact that it did not fit my 16"" Makita. If anyone is using the Makita 16"" and knows of a good replacement let me know. Thanks"
3,We're talking way old school...,"I got a pair of these for Xmas and was amazed that they're making these shoes again. These are very retro, Walter Payton days...Positives - the whole line of Tai Chi's are very cool looking, very retro, lots of different colors to choose from. Mine came with both white and blue laces to choose from. The cool pouch on the side of the shoes is a conversation piece.Not so positives - These aren't very comfortable shoes. They're not horrible but they're definitely not cushy like a pair of New Balance. Also they seem a little overpriced for what you're getting.So get them if you're looking to relive the '80s and only plan on wearing them every now and then."
1,Cheap knock off copy. But great book by Gardiner,Amazon sent me a cheap copy of the hardcover edition that fell apart in six months. The content of the book is really good and it is useful both as a text for regular classes and a hand book for researchers. But spending a hundred dollars and getting a knock off is pretty disappointing.
2,"Great Track Selections, Great Performances, Too Bad About the Sound!","There is no doubt that the track selections of overtures plus the famous Nachtmuzik have rarely been performed at such a high standard and yet I'm left very disappointed at the poor sound quality of this AAD recording. I hope Sony gets their act together soon and re-release the entire ""Great Performances"" series fully remastered from the best possible source tapes in the vaults and as a plus, package them all in mini-lp sleeve replicas. My advice is to wait for better sounding versions to be released as I have heard rumours that Sony are indeed looking into it."
2,"Quack, quack","It has bright colors and seems to last. My only complaint is that it is thin. The bill on the duck curled after I washed it the first time. It has such thin backing, it just curls up and does not stay in place. At least on in the bathroom floor."
3,"Nice rug, but...","This is a cute rug for a children's bathroom. However, it does not have non-slip backing which is a big deal especially for children."
5,Great Product and Price,If you like a rougher scrub try this. It is a wonderful scrub and this is an excellent price.
5,Great Study Guide,This must be one of the best spiritual dream books that I have read and used as a study guide. As a biblical studies teacher I truly spend time reading and analyzing works before recommending. This truly one that needs to be on the list of those who God has given the gift of interpreting dreams or if you want to learn how to do it yourself.
3,Not what I thought it would be...,"Unfortunately, I was looking for something that went into more depth about dreams and their interpretations. What is represented in this book is some personal dreams experienced by the author. However, there is an extensive ""dream dictionary"" in the book. So if you want to know the biblical meaning of colors, animals, vehicles, body parts, etc. mean in your dreams this is an excellent resource! I would definitely reccomend for that reason."
4,dont miss this album!!!,i am on my 3rd copy of this excellent gothic/black metal masterpiece go on give it a try
2,"Just okay, nothing to rave about","I have two of these feeders in my yard along with several others and these are always the last to empty if even at all. Most of the time I have to dump the liquid as the birds don't empty it before the liquid begins to rot. Based on my other feeders I think it's the flower that may keep the birds away until they are desperate for food. The birds seem to go after the tube or funnel shaped flowers first and these are just flat. The price was right, so I'm not to upset with the quality."
4,War at Every Door,"There is a factual error in this book. W. B. Carter was the brother of Samuel P. Carter, not the cousin."
3,Solid Collection of Library Tracks & Scores,A solid collection of fun tracks from all the globe - though all would not be out of place in an Italian library collection. Not as great as some of the other collection such as the Cincetta or Tempo ones ... also loses a star for surpringly middling sound quality.
1,Leaky Hummingbird Feeder,"Filled the feeder, placed in tree - found hummingbird food all over my deck furniture.. LEAKS. Do not recommend."
1,Don't buy this feeder.,"The description says easy to clean. How is it easy to clean when the base does not come apart to clean it? Anybody who knows anything about hummingbird feeders knows that for the birds safety you must keep the feeder clean! Worse, because the base is a solid green you would not be able to see mold build up in it. I do not recommend this feeder."
5,Great Book!,"""In a succinct and eminently readable text, I found an authoritative introduction to the art and pitfalls of the cleaning process."""
5,Really Great and interesting stories !!,"I read this book, and I was really surprised about the adventural and interesting stories from all over the world. Monroe tells the stories in such an interesting way that I also want to visit all this places immediatly. I don't promise you to much!! IT IS REALLY FASCINATING TO READ THIS BOOK!!! BUY IT !!!"
3,Tales From On The Surface by Julian Monroe Fisher,"We had the pleasure of meeting Monroe on a recent vacation, and knew we had to read his book after hearing him talk about some of his adventures. The tales are exciting and interesting--if one can get past the incredible grammatical and spelling errors throughout the book. The editing is positively nonexistent. In fact, it reads as though Monroe printed up his travel notes without even rereading them! I don't know who ""Big Top Publishing"" is, but their reputation is on the line with this one."
1,Not THE Walter Rhodes,"The artist of this album is not THE Walter Rhodes, a well-known Memphis blues old-time accordion performer, but a modern bluesman who took his name, calling himself Walter ""Lightning Rod"" Rhodes. This CD is therefore not a collection of rare cuts of Walter Rhodes, but just a mediocre piece of modern work on a field of blues revival / delta blues / acoustic blues. The recordings date back to 1988-89, not to 1927.If you dig downhouse blues revival artists like Taj Mahal, Alexis Korner, John Hammond, Corey Harris, etc, you might find this CD enjoyable. I'm still highly dissatisfied with my offer because it is not what I wanted and the description of the item does not explain enough - I hope this review improves that."
4,PEOPLE of the ANDES,"As would be expected from a publication by National Geographic, this book has beautiful pictures covering all regions of the Andes Mountains. Buyers should take note, however, that this book focuses more heavily on portraits of the people in these South American countries than on panoramic vistas of the Andes Mountains themselves (review the cover of this book to see the main focus). Also, too many blank pages for my tastes and budget. Otherwise, an exquisite book."
2,Major Flaw,"Installed backup pump per instructions 2 months ago. Tested the backup pump by unplugging main pump and filling sump pit with garden hose. Everything worked fine and gave me a peace of mind that I no longer need to worry about power outages when I'm gone. I went down today to check battery level and that checked okay. It was raining this morning so I had a chance to see main (Zoeller 57) pump cycle on. That's when I notice water shooting out the bottom of the backup pump. It told me the cheap, garbage, mini check that Zoeller uses on their backup pump failed. I should have followed advice and my instincts to remove their check and use a better check in the system.Zoeller should be ashamed that they compromise what would be a good product had they spent a couple bucks more on a better check.I now have to remove the whole system and rebuild it. What a pain.This one major flaw in the design of the pump means that I can't recommend this pump unless you upgrade the check."
3,Don't just follow the instruction,"the backup pump can airlock very easily if you just simply follow the instruction. don't glue the pump directly into the tee because you will have to cut the tee in order to fix it. I had to adjust it after the first try and it was not fun. I should have read more carefully on some of the other comments. I also agree the build-in check value is not the best quality one, it will probably fail and cause more issues for the main pump later."
4,works as advertised,I receive it and installed it with no problem. a must have for any home owner with a finished basement. highly recommended
1,The customer service is horrible. Don't buy from them! No Good!,"I have bought this from them and the charger has a low frequency sound. I have contact them many times and they will direct you to the manufacturer. When I call the manufacturer, they said never heard of this seller! My problem is not solved and I am not happy at all."
1,False sense of security,"I purchased this system and had it professionally installed 18 months ago. When I just tested it because it's spring and the sump is filling fast, it was non-operational. The Aquanot battery (Zoeller's brand) ran dry and failed. It is a wet marine battery that the water evaporates from. You have to add water to this battery once a month. Who has time for this kind of maintenance, especially if you install it in a seasonal home? I took it to Sears and they said it was completely discharged. I replaced the battery with a sealed DieHard.Equipped with a new, fully charged battery, I proceeded to test the backup pump. It hums but doesn't discharge any water at all. Good-bye pump.The only parts I'm keeping on the system after one year are the battery charger and the battery case. The rest is junk."
5,Marlboro grilling,This a manly man's cookbook for grilling. These recipes are not for wusses as they bring some heat to the palate. Great stuff.
1,upset,ive been wanting this cookbook for a while now.. and tho it may not entirely be the senders fault i do not know but i got it in the mail all damaged up the plastic looks horrid and pages are bent.. either it was that way and sent or just not proper envelop for sending and the mail man thus messed it up not happy at all i guess you get what you paid for shouldnt go so cheap next time
3,Very medicinal to me,I guess this is alright enough. Sort of antiseptic smelling. Not exactly what I was hoping for but it will do. I just drop a few drops near my window and open it slightly.
4,Patio Fire Pit,"I purchased this firepit as a surprise to my wife and she couldn't be happier. The copper pit is stylish and performs well. It is the perfect size and can hold good sized logs but is not too heavy so it is easy to move around. The all weather cover that is included is a little disappointing, it allows water to leak in."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"I purchased this item and it was great...in the beginning. The screen cover rusted and then rotted out. The Sportsman Guide does offer 30 year guarantee but the catch is...they only offer 3 months to ship it back. I had for 4-5 months when it rotted out and I was told I would have to pay to ship it back. The cost of that was $93. because of distance, Minnesota and weight! Therefore, you know that is not an option. Asked customer service if I could have a new screen cover and told no, it comes from factory so nothing they could do. Unless you are within driving distance of Minnesota I would NOT recommend purchasing this item."
3,color not as expected...,"I ordered the lipstick in the color, ""soft kiss,"" which is described as a light pink, but it is a sort of chalky, very pale lilac. i wanted a natural lipstick without preservatives and artificial colors, so I'm making it work by layering it with a darker pink gloss on top. it's nice and hydrating - I will probably try one of the darker colors in the future."
3,"Nice color, but too soft","This brand seems pretty inconsistent. I have ""seduction"" and that color stays on well, but this one seems to wipe right off. It's very moisturizing, though, if that's what you're looking for. I'm hoping that they will improve the formula, though I hear that they've already changed it once."
4,I love this lipstick but wish it were stronger,"I love this lipstick and appreciate that it contains more natural ingredients. The color is great and I've been using it for several years, usually ordering 3 at a time. I'm not sure what happened, but the tube changed from black to silver awhile ago, and I started having problems with them breaking. I'd get a 1/3 or a 1/2 the way into the lipstick and it would shear off, leaving a mess in the tube. Too expensive to throw them out, so I live with it, and because I really do love the color. But I never broke one in the black tube, and have broken every single one in the silver tubes. Don't know if it was a formula change or the packaging, but it's left me keeping my eye open for a comparable color in another brand."
1,I'm a Lip Stick Connoisseur and hated this product,"Too hard, goes on dry, clumps up. It took forever to ship. Definitely not a satisfied customer. I went with ""Origins"" products. Way better and only $5 more but so worth the extra cash to have it right away and for a much better product. Will not order from this company again, let alone buy any of their products."
4,Nice lipstick for the price,"I've used this lipstick brand and color before so didn'thesitate to reorder it. T did discover that the color is notexactly the same as the first one but close enough. Too,I try not to put much force on the product when applying toprevent breakage and on't roll it out all the way. I'm pleasedwith this product and it's cost."
3,It's nice,"It's nice for a natural lipstick. However, in the summer months it gets soft so it needs to be refrigerated. The color is nice. It's not exactly red. It's between red and fuchsia."
5,Favorite of my kids,My kids always loved this book. I just read it to a group of first graders and they all clapped at the end - something the never do. It's a sweet story with cute pictures. I give it as a gift whenever I can. Love this book!!
4,Perfect replacement chainsaw chain,"I am very pleased with this product. I have a seldom used McCullough electric chainsaw with a blunted chain, but I couldn't find an OEM replacement (McCullogh went out of business years ago). I looked in all the local hardware stores including HomeDepot and Lowes but no luck. I found it very easy to install, and have used it for several small jobs. It is well priced, at ~$15 with shipping."
5,Works Great!,"Replaced my the chain saw chain in my old Remmington Chain saw and cuts like a charm, gave new life to my chain saw."
3,Karin,"This a wonderful series and yet another twist on the vampire myth. For those who do not like subtitles I'm afraid the English dub is net very good with some very poor audio mixing on the English track which makes the voices to loud and background sounds to soft. For those who don't mind subtitles the Japanese language track it brilliant and well worth listening to as it is much better mixed.In all Karin is an interesting story being part love story be it an awkward one, part comedy, part school drama and part action story but if your looking for horror don't bother, the only scary thing in this series is Kenta's face (Karin's love interest)I'd certainly recommend giving this series a try as it is certainly entertaining.For those who insist on watching the English language track I warn you Karin's voice is rather annoying and a very similar to her best friend Maki, its just a pity such a good series has been let down by bad casting and even worse audio mixing."
5,Awsome!,"When I first watched this I fell in love with the opening. The puppets are hilarious as can be. The family is awesome as well. I own all the volumes, and I haven't been happier with my purchases! The story line is great. There is so much I could say about this series, but the only way for anyone to fall in love with it like I did is for them to buy it themselves. I definitely recommend this volume along with the others."
3,"Best mini-series, ever!","If you're familiar with the manga, the Karin anime's first six episodes are close to the manga storyline, introducing all new original crappy content with the seventh episode. While the manga has storylines exploring the problems of the son of a poor single mother, a woman's difficulties in a male-dominated workplace, and even a high school student living as a prostitute, the anime ignores the more PG-rated themes, and glosses over the manga's storyline. But, in return, the Karin anime has some of the finest and fun direction I've seen in an anime adaptation of a manga. Vibrant colors and ""snappy"" animation make the first six episodes a treat to watch. But, as said, with the seventh and eighth episodes, the anime introduces a non-manga character, a vampire hunter who can't stand blood. His character development is pretty flat compared to the the two main characters, and is little more than yet another cliched anime stereotype. Enjoy the first six episodes then read the manga."
2,Disappointed,"""Anne of Green Gables"" has it all over this series - even though it's by the same author. Some of the episodes are O.K., but most are over the top unrealistic."
5,Reflections of childhood.. LOVE it!,"I love it! Some of the ghosts and such in the story, is a bit much for my liking but over all it is a delightful series. Emily makes me smiles as she learns life lessons and the joys & struggles of family and friendship. I contacted the publishing company and they said season two is scheduled to be released in Dec. 2009. I do hope they will put season 3 and 4 out too. I would enjoy owning the entire 4 years."
5,Emily is most enchanting!,"If you loved Anne of Green Gables and stories with spunky heroines, you will love Emily too!I accidentally discovered this wonderful series while I was home from work recovering from surgery and was flipping through the channels looking for an alternative to the daytime soaps and talking heads.What a find! Emily draws you in from the very first episode and develops each character in an exciting and delightful way. Just when you think you know everything there is to know - Surprise! I have enjoyed every single episode and my only complaint is that the other seasons are not yet avaialable on DVD. Until then . . . I am sharing my find with my family and friends and enjoying rewatching Emily do her magic!"
1,"Piece of junk that is NOT fun, doesn't work","DO NOT BUY!!! #1: This toy is quite clumsy. It is for a kid age 10 and up who has hands big enough to use it. #2: The instructions say that ""you can record 8 fortunes."" You can only record ONE! #3: The instructions are a mess- they have English and 4 ohter languages all mixed in!. #4: The toy requires 4 LR44 batteries that are VERY expensive. This is a complete piece of junk."
2,Full of errors,"I just finished the diagnostic test at the start of the book, and have already found at least a dozen errors. For example, the answer choices in the answer explanations do not always match the answer choices given with the question."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this book to freshen up on the test as I took it a couple of months ago, and wanted to use their practice tests. The questions are very unlike the actual tests, the format is completely different, and they don't even put the test sections in the correct order. DO NOT BUY!! It is a complete waste of money."
1,Barron's publishings,"In regard to the comment that this edition of Barron's family has mistakes; I couldn't agree more! I had Barron's GRE book and guess what? that one had mistakes in it as well, most of them were in math section. God, that made me mad! Imagine, you are studying for a test, and then boom! they tell you 2+2=5 (just a comparison), and I am like - huh?! I think Barron should publish a free book that would show corrections to all of their publications!"
2,Out of date - You Can Buy Better,"I've used Barron's, Kaplan, Princeton Review & the ETS books, and I have to say that either Kaplan or Princeton Review are far more helpful. Not only was this Barron's book out of date (the tests aren't structured like the CATs are!), but it's explanations often lacked depth. In addition, either Kaplan or PR books give you far more helpful tips. In the Quant section of this Barron's, they don't even touch on Probability and Statistics, two areas now far more common since the tests have been getting harder (in response to the huge increase of people taking the GMATs). Get the ETS, Kaplan or PR for more up to date sample tests. This one isn't worth it."
1,Unreliable,"The Math sections contain mistakes; this makes one waste time during practice tests. Some of the passages in the Reading Comprehension sections are missing some paragraphs (which can be found in the CD-ROM version.) The explanations for the answers are far from convincing. Generally, the book does not inspire confidence at all. Don't buy it."
1,Beyond Bad,"No, really. Very, very bad. Look for my reviews of the Princeton Review and Kaplan books for recommendations and stay the heck away from this book."
2,Outdated and non-representative,"There are some good features to this book, especially the chapter on essay writing, but they are outweighed by its defects. The most crucial is that the verbal questions are simply not truly representative of actual GMAT questions. In addition, sometimes the answers given in the book are simply wrong, and there are many misprints. The math sections are OK. If somebody gives this book to you, you can get something out of it, but if you're spending money, there are much better choices."
2,Not Helpful - Bad Computer Tests,"I am using three books and the free test prep software from [...]. While Princeton Review's book accurately simulates the computer version of the test through its website, Barrons has a horrible CD that does not tally your score or administer the test correctly. For example, reading comprehension questions were jumbled throughout. Also, some of the math questions simply were incomprehensible. While I scored an 88% on the Princeton Review CAT, I got a 68% on the Barrons' version. (I can't verify if one is more accurate than the other alone, but from the general skepticism of others I thought it was clear that Barrons left many with a similar experience.)Spend the money for the Princeton Review book that gives you access to 4 online CAT's - that's the best way to actually know how you will do I think."
2,"No shortcuts, no techniques, just bizarre!","This book is truly unusual and therefore a terrible place to start studying. The quantitative review pays no heed to the fact that you are sitting for a timed test and therefore must work efficiently, using shortcuts when possible. This book tells you the long way to get to the answer. For that, it is a decent way to go if you want to really re-learn the math that underlies the problems (for example, I found the Princeton Review book to have too many ""tricks"" and not enough real math review). I did learn a few things from it, but eventually abandoned it for Kapan and GMAC guides. Not a complete waste of time, but certainly not where I'd recommend beginning or ending your GMAT study adventure."
1,Worst Book,This is the biggest waste of money I ever committed. The math review is not comprehensive enough. I'm looking at other review books and there are many concepts not covered in Barron's. The section where it reviews grammar does not explain the rules in detail and assumes one has a knowledge of basic grammar. I think if we didn't need brush-ups on the basics then we wouldn't be looking to buy these review books. I would definitely advise against buying this book.
3,"Outdated, but good start","The book may be a little outdated. However, I liked the Essay Writing Review and think that the Math questions are pretty good. As for the critical reasoning, I found that the questions were different from those on the actual GMAT and I sometimes didn't quite agree with the reasoning. The other verbal sections are fine. I bought this book first, then Kaplan and the Official ETS Guide. Barron's was good to develop my skills. Yet, I wouldn't recommend studying this book right before the test. For that, the questions are just not similar enough to the real ones."
1,Full of mistakes - don't buy this book,"I wasted two weeks with this book before I realized that it was full of errors. Every answer key has at least a few mistakes in it, and sometimes the answer explanations would say C) but then go on to describe why B) was the correct answer.This book also does not mention the fact that it is a computer based test and that getting correct answers results in harder questions coming up - and that getting the early questions correct is the only way to get a higher score.This book ALSO gives 5 practice tests that are organized into 7 sections - THIS IS NOT THE FORMAT OF THE GMAT EXAM. And I checked with a friend who confirmed that when he took the GMAT in 1999 it was in the same format it is now.I'm not upset that I wasted $20 on this book, but I'm very upset that I wasted my time. This book very well could have hurt my score and my chances to get into a certain MBA program."
1,Errors and Frustration Abound,"I bought the Barron's GMAT book because I succesfully used their SAT book when I was in high school. I am about 170 pages into it and have found and documented 6 instances where the book is flat out wrong. For example, pg 163 in a table giving decimal equivalents of fractions the book says 1/100 = 0.1. Wrong!!! The errors have caused me great frustration and if my test wasn't 2 weeks away, I would burn this book and get another one. Don't they edit these things? I can't speak for any of the other manuals but I would advise steering clear of the Barron's book. If authors Jaffe (MBA, PhD) or Hilbert (Phd), or anyone from Barron's would like my error list, I'd be glad to provide it...for a refund of course."
1,So many errors!,I picked up this book to have as a classroom resource. Bones and muscles are labeled incorrectly. I am amazed that this was even published!
2,Radio Your Way LX AM/FM Radio Recorder,"Regrettably, this product did not work for us. It is a very good way to record favorite radio programs, but the range of coverage was minimal limiting the use for us. We were wanting to record programs from an AM radio station 100 miles from here and we could not get the reception. Therefore, I returned the radio/recorder."
4,Pogo Radio Recorder,"This is a wonderful invention. Has the ability to record AM FM radio Broadcast,MP3 player, and voice on the go. unattended, recordings from AM FM any time, any where.Very easy to program, A fantastic piece of Electronics. Thanks POGO.."
3,Obsolete? Not yet,"I don't own this product, yet. But i felt like I needed to clarify something in the previous review. The previous reviewer noted that the Radio Your Way was now obsolete, because the iRiver H10 20 GB MP3 can do the same thing, better. Um no. The iRiver (and every other MP3 player to the best of my research) still is missing the one critical ingredient that makes the Pogo absolutely unique - AM Radio! It's unbelievable to me that not one of the major MP3 makers make a portable AM/FM MP3 player. Still don't understand why this is so difficult. There have to be alot of people in the world like me, that like to listen to talk radio and also listen to my own music playlists. Until other manufacturers are on board, the Pogo Radio Your Way is the ONLY game in town and that's why I might own it soon myself."
4,RYW does what it claims to do.,"A good product for the AM radio buff. I have read complaints about this unit not being easy to use, instruction manual being poor, unit size being too big, etc., etc. It's all true! I imagine this is the unit the engineers at Apple might have produced if Steve Jobs wouldn't have ordered them to make it simpler. But it's the only MP3 unit with AM radio, and I think the only one that records up to 10 programmed events, just like a VCR. If you're a bit of a techno geek and don't mind spending some time to figure it out, this unit is definitely worth it. PS - Be sure to go to their website and upgrade the firmware. Older versions have had some bugs, but the good news is that the unit IS upgradable as these bugs are discovered and worked out."
2,Becoming obsolete,"A few years ago this would have been a perfectly acceptable AM/FM/MP3 player/recorder solution. Nowadays, the digital music/recorder market is flooded with competitors and this product is in danger of becoming obsolete. Compared to similar products on the market, the Radio Your Way LX has...1) Less battery life2) Less memory space3) Poorer interface4) More expensiveI was disappointed by this product and will be returning mine. I plan on purchasing the iRiver H10 20 GB MP3 Player/Recorder which is only slightly more expensive, but is also an excellent MP3 player. It can also handle the AM/FM radio recording--a feature that Radio Your Way previously had a monopoly on the market (the iRiver documentation even says recording can be pre-set). Don't bother with the Radio Your Way LX."
4,The best out there for what I want to do,"I have had a Pogo RYW LX for over a year. What few quibbles I have had have mostly been fixed with their software upgrades. It really is an amazing unit. Bang for the buck is huge and in its niche, it does what nothing else does, as well as I could hope for. Perfect? No. But I haven't played with a toy that is. The built-in mic for voice recording is O.K. but no auto gain control means the recordings get distorted when the volume gets louder. Or if you turn it down, the signal to noise ratio is bad.Buy one and enjoy recording your favorite shows when you can't or forget they are on. In fact, I am back today, over 1 year later, to buy another one for a gift for someone. I am that impressed with it. You can also use a 2 gig SD card if you format it as FAT32 while connected through USB to Windows and format it there. WooHoo! Now you are talking storage for audio."
1,Very Poor AM Reception,"I was so excited to get this product, but I am so disappointed: AM reception is awful. I've tried it at home, work, driving, and at a variety of locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and the reception is worse than any other AM radio that I've ever heard. It even has trouble picking up the 100,000 watt powerhouse AM station in my area. It's very directional, but static is high on every station even at optimum positioning. I've tried coworkers' inexpensive AM radios at my workstation, and they receive all signals very well. Based on the other positive reviews, I'm guessing that I have a defective unit. Without good reception, the recording features are worthless; therefore, I can only give this unit one star. If I get a replacement, and if it works properly, I'll amend my review."
3,Pogo Radio Your Way - A little disappointed,"I've had the radio about a month and it basically does what it's supposed to, but with one pretty serious limitation. It does a good job of scheduling recordings on AM/FM and playback is flawless. The one problem I'm seeing is the sensitivity of the AM and particularly the FM leaves a lot to be desired. Some stations that come in well on my other pocket radio (Sangean DT200V)are marginal to useless on the Pogo. One of the major talk radion stations I like to listen to has a late night show I like so I bought the Pogo to record it. Unfortunately, while the show comes in clearly on my Sangean, it's very marginal on the Pogo, with lots of static."
2,I'ts not a big deal,"unfortunately at the little time of buying it began to present operation problems, the buttons didn't work when I push it, sometimes press a function and it makes other, I like that it is good recorder but the scroll to select the functions it is bad.The sound is not very clear, but for non demanding people is ok."
3,Radio Your Way Out of Business,"I think these folks have gone out of business. I tried contacting them today, but got no where. e-mail, phone or web. I called C. Crane and they thought so too."
1,"A good idea, a bad product.","Is a buggy product. It freezes with no reason and if you try to reset it (that was the sugested solution) then the radio stops working completely.It is a shame, because the idea of recording radio shows 'vcr style' is really original.I tried 2 of them, then I gave up. Fortunatelly I found the alternative for programmed radio recordings (Sangean radio)."
3,Radio Your Way LX AM,The radio is unuseable when plugged into an AC power source using the adapter that came with it. There is so much noise/buzz that you cannot hear the station. Even when using the battery there is still background noise but at least you can hear the station.Documentation is poor.
2,Swing and a miss...,"This is a fantastic idea that has been poorly executed. I love to listen to AM talk radio, but I can't always or often tune in at work. So I thought this would be a great way to get my fix... The reception is not what I would like (both AM and FM), and the unit hangs up at odd times. Here's the real clincher, though: I had a problem with really awfully ""staticky"" recording when I was using a 1GB Sandisk SD card to record my favorite radio program. I called Pogo Products to try to get a solution to this problem. The guy at Pogo told me that the problem was my SD card. he told me to return the card to the store and try another one. I told him that I'd keep the card and return the Pogo unit. I should like to say that if Pogo stays in business, I'll definitely *consider* buying the next version of the RadioYourWay- I love the idea, as it meets a very specific need for me. But this one's heading back to Korea."
5,"Replacement Chain for a Craftsman 18"" Chainsaw","Wow, the new chain cut through wood like a warm knife through butter. My old original chain became dulled through normal use and I needed a replacement chain. The cost online was much cheaper than at the big box home improvement stores. I guessed on this product and was VERY PLEASED. I purchased two of them and am so happy."
5,Worx WG 304,This chain fits the now discontinued WORX WG304 18-inch electric chainsaw. It cuts as good as the original chain the saw came with.
5,Good buy,They were a lot cheaper than the local hardware store and were the same exact product. I would buy again.
2,Item not identical to advertised item,"I recently purchased an Oregon S62 chainsaw chain, as pictured on Amazon.com. The item I actually received arrived in a different box than in the picture on Amazon.com. There were no markings anywhere on the box that the chain was an S62 and identical to the Oregon S62. When I contacted the seller, he indicated that they shipped the item in a different box, which I already knew. The chain is NOT the identical chain. It doesn't cut nearly as good."
5,Chain replacement,"I bought this just because the price was so good. My chain is still ok but will need replacing soon, now i have one when it needs to be done."
1,Screwed,TTT his is what I ordered but they sent me the cheap ass blades in the little boxs but they only last half the time as the ones in the plastic packs lol scamers Max
5,18-iinch chain saw replacement chain,Great product at a fantastic price! Much better deal than I could ever find locally. Shipped promptly and for free from this vendor!
4,"Item that arrived looked different than the picture, but works fine.","The item I received did not look like the item in the picture. But, when I installed the new chain on my 18"" Craftsman chainsaw, it worked great."
2,Very good for introduction,I think that this book is perfect for the new-comer at NT technology. But if you are an administrator and you need a good troubleshooting and understanding tool there are not much you can gain from it.
2,Little short on content,"I liked this book, but found it a bit light in several ways. It was very short, and there's not much you can do in the retelling of a Greek myth - or at least so the author found. So, why a book?"
2,Look for yourself,"I give Andrew Calimach props for discovering transending topics in today world veiw. I'm doing research on greek mythology and I strongly believe Calimach doesn't know what he wrote about. Calimach picked out anything that remotely seemed to show homosexual tendency's. The reader has to understand it was common practice to become close with someone with in the Greek Community. I suggest that if you have read or about to read this book (Lovers' Legends: The Gay Greek Myths) that you do your own research with an objective eye. To make the deision, what is gay? and what was simply wrote from a homeric point of view."

StormBag is a quick, easy, and cost effective product in an emergency situation because with StormBag ""ALL YOU DO IS ADD WATER."""
4,NICELY PACED POLITICAL INTRIGUE W/STRONG CHRISTIAN MESSAGE,"I like this series, because I am intrigued by politics. Ms. Hart's description of D.C. intrigue, protocol and culture sound informed and ring true. The action, characterization and dialogue are quite good. The key to Left Behind's political series is that it is intended for a Christian audience--or at least to readers who are sympathetic to evangelical spirituality. There is a lot of dialogue in these pages, and much of it will garner ""amens"" from the already converted.Bottom-line: This is intelligent, realistic end-times fiction, with lots of political intrigue, and a direct Christian message. For those with minds open to spiritual discussion, Necessary Evil is an easy recommendation. For those who do not like to be preached at, or who tend to berate anything remotely ""religious right,"" save yourself the antacid and avoid this whole series."
3,"""I'm glad I got this DVD but....""","There are more thrilling organ videos out there...Phillip Delacour and Hans Andre Stamm come to mind. This organ has no ornamentation on the keyboard or stops compared to the organs on the Delacour and Stamm videos. The program is 1/2 chorales and 1/2 Bach's showier more concert type pieces. There are 5 chorales from Orgelbuchlein, plus Jesu meine Freude, Nun Danket alle Gott, Jesu bleibet meine freude, and Vor deinen Thron tret ich hiermit. The concert type pieces are Toccata in d minor BWV565, Prelude and Fugue in A minor BWV543, and Toccata and Fugue in F major BWV 540. The video is good, showing the player's feet on relevant passages, and good video of the organ pipes and placement within the church. I had to turn the volume way up and it still wasn't impressive sound that you would expect from such a great organ."
1,Horrible sound,"The quality of the recording is below all standards. A real pity since the organ has a beautiful sound and the organist is excellent. It does not justice to J.S. Bach, the DVD that is."
2,Sloppy & Careless Ad for Aerospace Industry,"As other commenters have noted both the editing and the science behind the book are sloppy and careless. The strategies and tactics for defending earth have not been well thought out. A section of the book amounted to a paen to governmental secrecy and why the authors think it is important. And to why the government should give large amounts of money to aerospace companies and lie to the people about it.Some interesting ideas, and might be worth buying for about a third of the price.EDIT TO ADD: If you really think the risk of alien invasion is worth the unaccountable spending by sub-competent engineers and scientists that this book recommends, you should read Charles Stross's essay,[...] , discussing the near impossibility of travel over interstellar distances."
4,Planetary Defense,"An interesting foray into the what-ifs and why-fors of preparing for an extra-planetary attack of some sort or another.This book not only delves into the hows and whys of a ""classic"" alien invasion (as seen in science fiction), but non-standard approaches that should be accounted for.For example, the book also deals with: preparing for collisions with Near Earth Objects; preparations for civil defense, in the case of natural disaster; dealing with a resource depletion scenario of our own devising by reaching out to the stars.I recommend this book to:* Science fiction authors* Civil defense planners (not only federal, but state and local)* Military history afficionados* Wargamers* & anyone else involved in strategic or tactical planni"
4,Awesome Product!!,Portable Pilates is so easy and fun to do. You can take it with you on weekend trips and all you need is a CD player. I also love the illustrations!I only wish it was a longer class... definitely seeing results though!
1,Portable Pilates,Cute illustrations but for cost value a bummer. Very little information for the price of the book. The CD may make it worth the price but not the book content.
2,"I can't imagine why it's called ""slow intermediate""","Well, the intermediate part is right, although some of the moves are more properly termed advanced. However, I completely disagree with the 'slow' part: she went so fast I couldn't keep up, and I had taken about a dozen Pilates classes and am generally in a decent shape. The thing about Pilates is not to go fast, but to do it right, and put effort and thought into each move - there is no time for those things on this CD. I suggest Brooke Siler's CD and books instead."
4,thorough & complete,"this is a perfect compliment for the beginner to low intermediate student who wishes to add workouts outside of the studio. the cueing is good, there is no annoying background music, we get plenty of emphasis on breathing, and the pace is workable. the mat exercises performed are: the 100, roll up, leg circles, rolling like a ball, single & double leg stretch, single & double straight leg stretch, criss cross, spine stretch, corkscrew, saw, single leg kick, neck pull, side series: front, side & leg circles, teaser, swimming, seal, finishing with releve. there is a useful workout rating chart at the end of the book which helps as a reminder of important cueing.ms. ungaro has a pleasant voice, gives cues clearly, and reinforces with corrections of posture flaws common to all students.i gave this only 4 stars because of the high price for a 20 page book and audio CD. the dvd ""pilates for dummies"" is only [price]."
5,Monet's Passion,"This book may be called Monet's Passion, but really it is all about a very passionate author and artist Elizabeth Murray.You can tell from reading (or browsing) this book that Murray has a deep passion for everything that relates to art, photography, gardening, and spirituality, or preferably all these mixed into one. This book is a must have for all those who want to have some inspiration for the soul."
1,I would rather have set my shoe on fire then watch this!,"Not directed by Tinto Brass. This movie was awful. I wasted enough of my life watching most of this movie, and it really does not deserve more of a review then that. You have been warned.But if you really have to have this movie, I would have given you my copy for the asking, except that I threw it away."
3,In Agreement,"Having read Pamela's comments here, I downloaded the main theme of Phaedra, which captures the original passion of the film but does, indeed, come off as tinny in its remastered version. Melina singing Apagi Mou remains marvelous, timeless. I also downloaded the City Of Prague Philharmonic's version of Phaedra and Apagi Mou which is spectacular. Highly recommended. Over the last week I've watched/listened to many versions of Theodorakis' incredible score on YouTube, and no matter how it is interrupted, it is eternally vibrant, exquisite, tragic."
1,Pass on this one,"I bought this yesterday and wish I hadn't. It seemed decent enough in the store, but when I got it home and plugged it in, it sounded like the cassette player was going to explode. After testing it out this afternoon the cassette player was already dragging a tape.I brought this back to Best Buy pronto."
2,Yuck,"Bernstein practically ruins the Grand Canyon Suite here. Never a subtle conductor, he hammers this beautiful piece into the ground."
3,Grand Canyon Suite Review,"While driving through the Painted Desert in Arizona on my way to NAU in Flagstaff I was listening to this CD and it just made the Painted Desert come alive. I could just picture each area of the Grand Canyon as the music came on. It was one of the most plesant drives I've taken in years. Also I was replacing a CD that had gotten stolen and I missed this mucic, so I ordered a replacement. I'm glad that I did. I danced to this mucis years ago at a ballet recital and the music had always remained with me. I really recommend playing this music as you pass through the Grand Canyon area but it's just as beautiful if you're sitting in your own living room or parlor listening to it."
3,Ring My Bell!...,"Jeannie Bell is TNT Jackson! She's on the trail of the scum-suckin' pigs who killed her brother! Watch out! TNT's not just beautiful, she's a martial arts master (mistress?) w/ vengeance on her mind! Yes, this movie does contain our heroine's topless kung-fu battle! Ms. Bell is semi-convincing in her role, talking tough while allowing her stunt-double to jump and fly through the air. Still, there is a nice butterfly-knife sequence and enough nudity and charm to make things bearable. Not bad..."
4,TNT Jackson Not just a clever title,"This movie really lives up to its billing. Jackson is one mean Mo Fo and don't take no ... from No honkey! What is great about this movie is the dialogue, i have never in my many years of watching films heard one smooth cat talk so much jive to so many sucka ... turkeys! Its a great film with wonderfully funky acting in it. You'd have to be crazy or white not to like this film."
1,did not receive,"I did not receive my dvd TNT jackson,would you please let me know the status on my film, thank-you ms.downing"
3,cheap leather,"When I saw this boots i wanted them so bad, I ordered inmediatelly, they are such a good looking boots and they look wonderful with jeans, but ones the leather start stretching the color start fading, right now my boots have two colors, look like I have been wearing this boot for years and I just wore them a couple of times , very dissapointed with the leather quality."
4,sweet!,"really good looking boots, can't wait to wear them out! heel is a little hard, but sizing was perfect to add a 3/4 dr scholl insert for some cushioning."
1,Would rather have purchased something else,I've had nothing but problems with this drive. i've been unable to make back-up copies of DVDs & CDs because it will not let me through the copyright protection from the movies or music disc. Has anyone else had this problem & if so please tell me how you corrected it or if i'm stuck with it?
5,What an Awesome Story,"My 3 year old grand daughter loves this cd. Now, I want to warn you, originally she was afraid of the deep sounding instruments. But after I listened to the cd with her, and make noises and movements with the sounds, she began to love it. I believe this cd will help to create a love of music in your child and mine."
2,Little bit disapointed,"I was not informed that this title has a narration in english intercalated with the music. Although I understeood almost everything, my family did not and my translation disrupted the listening. Pity."
2,May Well Be the Definitive Version But Who Could Tell?,"Especially when the sound quality is just so bad, you have to strain to hear just what Bernstein is saying for Peter and the Wolf and the volume levels increase only slightly for the Carnival of the Animals making this an extremely boring cd and definitely not worth the money. I'd recommend waiting for a remastered version of this to be released or to get some other version instead."
1,Don't waste your money,"This CD is a major disappointment. The""narration"" by Leonard Bernstein is NOT the Ogden Nash version but a dull soporific lecture on the instruments absolutely bound to turn any child or young person off of music forever. Don't waste your money!Read the fine print carefully in order to obtain the traditional Ogden Nash narration. The ""Peter and the Wolf"" is fine but there are as good versions to be found on other CD's."
2,Not a real concert CD,"There is a lot of narration throughout the Carnival of the Animals, which is distracting if you are just hoping to sit down and listen to classical music. The narration is not very insightful, either. It seems to have been intended for kids. But the music is good when you get over the narration."
2,Not so great,"I tried this on my Poulan Wood Shark (gasoline saw) because it was cheaper than a Poulan brand chain. I would only recommend it for temporary use. Cutting green oak, it dulled far more quickly than a Poulan chain. Worst of all, the drive links aren't shaped quite the same as on a Poulan chain and they started wearing little cuts into the drive cog. (About 1 mm of a cut after 4 hours use) It DID fit well and didn't stretch more than expected during the first uses, but because of the cog damage I would only use this again out of dire necessity until I could get a more suitable chain."
3,Michael Jackson History: The King Of Pop 1958-2009,"I agree with you Katrina like you I was hopeing for good things about Michael Jackson in this DVD, but I was sad to see all of the bad thing in his life and not the good thing that he has done. M.J. we miss you.Pat (Louisville, Ky.)"
1,MJ History DVD,"I agree with you both Katrina and Pat. Thanks for the heads-up, I will NOT be buying this DVD because it will only make me mad-der! MJ has given his life. What more do these people want from him. Like both of you, I am sick and tired of the negativity. These naysayers can't find anything on MJ so they just make stuff up as they go, for money, ratings or whatever. Enough already! I'm a huge fan since childhood. I grew up with this family and no matter what anyone says they are for me Black royalty and nobody can take that away. I also agree with the other fan who says she has been tricked into buying substandard merchandise selling under MJ's name. I had to learn (the hard way) that if it is not estate approved, DON't BUY IT! I've gotten stuck with a few things myself that were a total waste of good money with people capitalizing on MJ's passing. MJ has left a great legacy with good music and great footage. No one can EVER change that!Renee R-San Francisco"
1,The Uselesness of Schema,"I'm not too fond of this book, though there are a few phrases I like here and there (phrases, alas, are not poems). I, for one, am very aware of the artificiality of ""production"" when I read these ""poems"" and take it as a given that there are indeed no critical schema that can account for the non-poetic posturings of poseurs. Henry has some talent, however, albeit in its infancy, and I'd check out a book of his from the library if I saw one. I might even buy it if he were seen to break free from the academic self-consciousness that has stunted the work hitherto."
1,Embarrassing Incident,"If you're not interested in poetry so much as what poetry might be for, then welcome to Mr Henry's airless classroom of poetic ""technique"". There's some good--not great--writing here and the references and bag o'tricks on display leave no doubt that Mr Henry was always at the head of his class (which is their intention, no doubt). You don't get too far into the book without realizing that the desperate alterations of voice and register are not ""signs of a restless and probing poetic intelligence"" (the typical explanation offered for such pointless post-modern kerfuffelry) so much as an attempt to hide these poem's essential hollowness. Anyhow, the beat goes on. There are undoubtedly nine or ten people who read this and are sure Henry's a genius."
4,"Sturdy, lovely and space creating!","The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it could use additioinal supports to hold the wire rack in place to support more weight in pots/pans and books. Otherwise, this is very sturdy and just the right size for a handfull of pans and 15 or so books. We're also storing our rice cooker, food processor and some tea pots on it. Our kitchen is rather small, and this has increased the storage space in a very classy manner... i would recommend it to friends or family for sure.Update: We left the rack in the kitchen when we sold our house - our buyer was thrilled. We've since purchased another rack for our new apartment. I *love* this item!"
5,sturdy pot rack,This rack is sturdy if you mount it correctly. We used a special mounting bolt that we purchased at home depot. It is made especially for plastered walls which I have. I do not know how this would mount on plaster board walls as it is designed to hold lots of pots. I would definitely recommend this rack with the caution of proper mounting.
5,"Looks nice, holds a lot","We pushed this to the manufacturer's limit in daily use and it shows no signs of wear or pull. We were not blessed with studs in the correct location, so I placed three strips of decorative wood that I screwed into the studs, and then the rack into the wood. It looks nice and is truly solid. We also purchased extra hooks to accommodate extra frying pans."
1,Misrepresented??,This bookshelf is functional and descent quality but it wasn't what I expected when delivered. This is advertized as an 'Enclume' product on Amazon. This shelf is not made by enclume (the leader in pot racks)and was not made of the signature thick steel or finish. It does the job but I gave it one star for the way it was advertized.
1,discontinued item no refund,"When I purchased this item the hammered steel looks grey on the swatch shown its actually black with little grey flecks, when I contacted organize it, they informed me that this was a discontinued item and I can not exchange or refund this item. I do not recall seeing this on the order if I had known I would have ordered this through the manufacturer who said I have to get my money back and reorder through them even the swatch on their web site looks grey. I will no longer order through amazon either this is what I was afraid of happening but was recommended to use this site and decided to try it I am extremely dissatisfied with this whole order especially having to wait over a month just to get the product when I was told it would be shipped within two weeks."
3,Not what I expected,"I live in a small northern suburb, and didn't hear this musical until my school drama group decided to put it on. Be warned: if you don't like country, you won't like this. But for a country album, it's pretty good. And even if you don't like country, ""The Best Man"" more than makes up for the rest of the album."
5,Score brownie points with the girlfriend,"This is a great book, my girlfriend loved it. I bought it for my girlfriend as a gift. A very good surprise because, who gives books anymore? Just a word of advice....Get it early enough in a relationship so that the two of your still remember all your ""firsts."" It makes filling it out a lot easier."
5,A great trip down memory lane leaving a smile of your face!,"I have been looking at this book for a while but when we got engaged this week, the first thing I did once the dust settled was order this book. A fun thing to do on a dreary, rainy day together."
4,Couples - A hot little book about us,Came quickly and in good order. It will be a great little book to keep your early memories so you can look back in 10 years and have a laugh...
4,Very quick,My item was shipped and recieved very quickly. It was exactly what I expected and was in very good condition. Definitely recommend this seller!
4,Fun for children,My son loves to feed and watch the birds with this feeder. The top is easy to remove and there is a wide opening to pour the seed into. It holds just enough so we get to refill it every three days. The only problem is that there is no way to hang it in a tree without some rope to tie to the hanger.
3,false presentation,Received the book I wanted but was disappointed by the used bookstore sticker on it for $3.95 when I paid more than this plus s&h. The vendor should have removed the old price tag!
5,Great Gift!,I received this as a gift and it is wonderful! The pictures are beautiful and it has a really in-depth history of theatre in America. Great gift for a Theatre Major!
1,Green Day vids,"I bought this dvd twice! The first one I was not able to play due to it having another code, meaning it could only be played in the UK/Euro? So stupid me buys another one from the same people, which was stupid of me! So the same thing happens with the second one I bought! I am so pissed with this, and now I have to figure out how to return them? I will never buy from Movie Mars again! I just want my money back! :o("
5,Best of Green Day Before American Idiot!,"This dvd contains all of Green Day's videos released before the American Idiot album. They are of great quality and fun to watch. There are even two previously unreleased titles, Maria and Pop Rocks & Coke. A must for any Green Day fan!"
3,"Well,....... If you like Green Day video's..","Well, I bought it thinking it was a live show, and I was thrilled. And I put it in and it was music video's. So I was a little disapointed, but, I supose their pretty good. I have every Green Day cd, so I am a true fan, but.... I wanted live!"
2,International Supervideos!,"It doesn't have welcome to paradise, poprocks and coke, or macy's day parade. without those, it really sucked. they should make another dvd and put those AND american idiot on there."
3,Why did they have to edit it?!?!?!?!?,Green Day. The best punk rock band ever. Why did they F**k this DVD up by censoring it? Come out with an uneditied version and I'll buy it. Please don't do this again!
4,Good for new players- just like the title says Very hands on,This book is writen by two poker players one of which has published several of the biggest books in No Limit and Pot Limit poker. The book starts with a chapter for someone who has never played Hold'em poker at all. It's very quick and they recomend that if you know the game you can move past it.Tom and Brad lay out not only the bacis ideas behind when and how to bet in a no-limit game but they explain why. They write in a basic style that is easy to follow. This allows them to help you think more about poker hands and how they recommend you play them. The book has lots of scenarios and they explain the varous poker plays that are covered. If you are a hands on learner this is your book. I recomend the book for anyone thinking about getting in a No-Limit game.
4,Simple Effective Lessons for the Novice & Experienced Players,"Easy to understand and absorb. You'll find tips in here that aren't covered in other books. A great book for beginners, too."
3,Should be renamed TOURNEY NO LIMIT TEXAS HOLD' EM,"This book is not at all geared towards cash game hold' em players. Most of the information contained is specialized for no limit tournament style play. There are many valuable poker playing tips such as starter hands, a tourney betting chart, as well as an entire section on tournament situations and how to handle them effectively. Overall a good book if tournament games are your thing, but as for me, I am going to return the book and purchase Doyle Brunson's ""Super System""."
1,TOURNAMENT play for total BEGINNERS only.,"Worst poker book I've read! If you've played any type of poker at all this book will be useless. It's strictly for beginners with absolutely no experience. 99% about tournament games, only 1 small chapter on table/ring games.... Teaches NOTHING about calculating even basic odds or counting ""outs"", instead it suggests dealing out decks of cards & counting the results to see how they would turn out. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard & much more time consuming than learning a few very basic math skills."
1,Extremely poor quality sink,"We purchased one of these during a recent kitchen remodel. The first sink we received arrived broken in the box. So much for 'amazing rock hard material'. The replacement looked ok, but began to leak immediately after installation. We found that the cause was a small hole in the side of the sink, apparently a manufacturing defect.While I wait for another replacement (from a different brand this time), I have been using the sink with the hole in it. After hand washing a couple pots, I noticed scratches in the material. In three days of very light use there are now multiple obvious scratches.So... it breaks easily, scratches easily, and is likely to be defective to begin with. Buyer beware."
3,Project: Human Weapon review,"Okay, I'll admit, I only found this movie because of Victor Browne (the actor who plays the main character, Jerry). I'm a big Tremors: Tv Show fan, and I glanced around to see what else he was in.As for the movie, the story itself is really good; adventurous, dodging danger, reuniting with long-lost family. The telling of the story......well, not 100% terrible, I do re-watch it on occasion....but it's not that great. One example.....CGed planes and helicopters? Really?? I honestly shook my head at that.Not to be mean to the director......but I think it really would've turned out better if someone more experienced (better) had done it. It has some really good things going for it, but some really bad things too.Beyond that, if you like stories of running from the gov't, reconnecting families, adventure, and mental powers, by all means watch this movie. The telling may not be great, but the story itself is wonderful."
4,Great Fall Play Series,"This collection of three one-act plays is a great choice for a low-budget, low-royalties Halloween production."
4,Must read for the Lynah Faithful,"This book is a pleasant summary history of Cornell Big Red Hockey. There is a chapter for each of the six head coaches of the last sixty years, a chapter about hockey on Beebe Lake, and a final chapter on the Lynah Rink experience.The book is missing two things: color pictures and a summary of team year-to-year results. Lynah Rink has banners honoring the NCAA championships, NCAA appearances, ECAC championships, and Ivy League championships. I would like to see that summary in the final pages of the book."
3,Positive effects but not what I was hoping for,"I noticed and was disturbed by a thinning around my hairline. I tried this product after it was recommended by a friend. I haven't really noticed any exceptional hair growth and my nails are breaking just as much as they were before. The only positive effect I've really seen is that my hair seems silkier and smoother, making styling easier. I'll take it but was really hoping to see some baby hairs sprouting up around my face!"
3,More hair and more acne,"I noticed hair growth within three days of using this product, I also noticed and increase in acne as well. I discontinued use for a while and when I started back I noticed my acne returned. My coworker had the same issue with the acne and also the instant hair growth. I have another friend who is using it and she did not experience the sudden hair growth or acne. So it all depends on your genetic make up. I am currently trying be-beautiful by gnc, I have not noticed any results after the three days i've been on it."
4,Excellent Product,After 3 weeks of taking this vitamin my hair stopped falling out. I have lots of new growth and stronger nails as well.
3,Too many additives!,"This prodcuct is great, but they have added a lot of additives to it. Like Colourings, flavor, yeast and so forth. They have to come up with a purer version of this. You don't need all these junk in your system! I wish they would change their formula. My hair has stopped falling, but I don't know it might just be a coincidence"
3,good,"Heard alot about this product. Wanted to try this for hair growth, just haven't seen that much of a difference, but my nails grow and stronger than before."
1,disappointing,"They change the ingredients in the product! They add food coloring like YELLOW 6 E110 FD&C RED 40 E129, FDC BLUE 1 E133 and other things. They want to encourage hair growth, but can not use more natural ingredients?"
4,Good,"I ""kind of"" noticed some changes - the baby hair started growing around my hair line, I think my hair is growing faster, my nails are little stronger too. I used it for almost 2 months, I'm not sold on it yet, but will give it another 2 months, like recommended on the bottle."
3,Works for nails but not so much for hair alas,"When I first bought Phytophanere some years ago in France, it did work real well for hair (stop falling hair,...) and for nails. Now the two last bottles I bought had a real impact on nails (growing stronger, not breaking) but I don't feel any serious difference on hair.The other bad thing is that all the sellers on Amazon sell it at the same price ($50), while on EBay it seems to be more competition on price."
1,Marketing Gimick,Has less vitamin qualities than any childrens vitamin. You'd be better off taking a one-a-day and a glass of milk or bowl of jello....
2,Ehhhh...,"I can honestly say this stuff works, BUT what it mainly does is makes your hair thicker. I didn't realize it till after a year of using it I noticed it took a lot longer to do my hair, and realized it mainly stops your hair from falling out. I stopped taking it and my hair still grew, and went back to its normal fullness! This stuff also causes acne, not small pimples all over the face acne, but deep rooted cystic acne. I stopped spending an arm and a leg on this product and started buying Prenatal Vitamins and my hair grew ten times faster. The amount of Biotin and B6 is a lot less, which will in turn take longer for your hair to grow. Prenatal vitamins have selenium, niacin, and ten times more vitamins included that this product doesn't have. I encourage everyone to NOT buy this product, save money, and go buy yourself a 11 dollar bottle of prenatals, you will be much happier!"
1,Pills Decomposed,"I opened these and used them for about one week. When I went to get one after the initial use, these pills were decomposing. Inside, the bottle was covered with some substance and the pills felt damp. I am thinking that these were not appropriately stored. I threw them out but probably should have returned them. However, I was upset that I had ever ingested anything from that bottle!! Also, they were within the expiration date."
3,"Its ok, kind of pricey","I was using this product for many years and didn't see any great improvement in my skin, nails and hair. I was kind of afraid of stopping it in the case that it would cause some adverse effects. However, I found a similar product here on amazon for much less and have been using that ever since. The new product also did not produce any miracle results."
5,Seems to be helping.,"I started these vitamins about a 2 weeks ago. My doctor advised me to get a dietary supplement as my hair was thinning rapidly and I had no energy. Lately, I feel more energetic and I've noticed fine hair growing where I had hair loss. The package advises continuous use for at least 4 months. If I continue feeling the way I do now and my hair comes back, I will continue to use this for the rest of my life."
3,been using for one month,I definitely see a lot of new growth in my hair but I don't know if it stopped a lot of the shedding. I've only been taking it for one month and I saw a lot of reviewers advise at least 2 months of taking it before any amazing results but overall I was satisfied and might try it again.
3,May or may not work,I am using this product and will continue using this product until I see if it actually works. The 3 star rating is more about the uncertainty than having any problem with it.
1,Wasted time and money,"This product may have helped others to grow nails or hair, but it did nothing for me except waste my time and money. I took the vitamins for four months with and saw no improvement in skin, hair or nails, I would have been happy with at least having something improve. I will go to the health food store and ask for something they could recommend for my problems instead. I threw away over a hundred dollars and received nothing in return, I still have bad hair and nails. I would not recommend this product to my friends."
2,no change,I order this product with the intentions of thickening my hair and I have taken the vitamins every day for 1 month and I see no change in my hair or nails In fact my nails are weaker than before
2,poor shipping from this vendor,"The verdict is still out on this product. I am currently taking a host of other vitamins, so I am not sure what is working at this point. My problem is with the vendor. I received this product and a large percentage of them burst. Given the price, I may only have a 20day supply. Given the cost of this product, this is not a great deal. I'm purchasing elsewhere for my next bottle..."
3,Amazon Verified Purchase,"I have only been using this product for about a month. I was taking two capsules a day but I did read in a review that it could cause acne and for my age, getting any acne at all is unusual and I did start getting one here and there - not alot though. So, I dropped down to one a day but, I can notice that my hair has grown and it is much healthier! I am delighted with this product!"
4,results in 3 weeks,"I've been taking this product for about 3 weeks now, and my nails have grown super fast.. I can't say if theyre stronger, etc as I have acrylic on them. My hair has also grown faster, as the back of my neck is shaved and it generally takes longer for it to grow.. I already need a trim! My hair has also been easier to style."
2,Breakout!,"I read the reviews and still bought the vitamins because I had heard good things from friends. Unfortunately, I had the same experience as many other people who have used the product. While I did notice more rapid hair growth, my skin broke out to the point where I had to stop using the product. It just wasn't worth the damage it was doing to my face! Buyer beware."
1,yuck,I've been using this product for about a month and my hair now is terribly oily. I will shampoo my hair twice in the shower and immediately after blow drying it looks like I haven't washed it in days. Heavy weighed down and disgustingly oily. I even changed shampoo and it made no difference. Stopping this product immediately. Too bad I bought a 4month supply
3,Waiting results,"Very good service from seller, but still waiting for results after two weeks using this product."
1,Gave me breakouts,"I started taking these supplements about 2 weeks ago. I read in previous reviews they caused breakouts for some users which made me a little nervous to take them since I have sensitive skin. After 2 weeks my skin has broke out more than it has in years. I cant rate how it does for hair and nails, but I will say if you are prone to breakouts- be aware. I will take vitamin E supp w/ Biotin instead."
5,growing like a weed,So far these vitamins are amazing. My hair and nails grow fast already and this is just speeding up the process. I am having to cut my nails twice a week and people keep commenting on how long my hair is getting!
4,I've taken half of my first bottle of Phyto Phytophanere Hair/Nails...,"My nails have been paper-thin as long as I can remember. They were always tearing into the nail bed. I bought a bottle of Phyto Phytophanere at a beauty salon and have taken half of the bottle so far (two a day). I am astounded at the difference in my nails already! They are hard and are growing long. They do not bend or tear like they always did before. My nail bed is now pink and healthy looking. I am giving this product a four instead of a five because I cannot tell what effect it is having on my hair....(and it is advertised as being for hair also). It is also very expensive...and I hope its price drops in the future. It is advertised as a two month treatment, which confuses me a little. I do not understand how it works after one is no longer taking the pills. Will find out after my bottle is gone."
4,Seems to work...,"This product seemingly works well. Thus far my hair has been growing faster (don't ask me how this is possible) and my nails have been in pretty decent shape as compared to how they used to be (brittle, short). Would recommend and will repurchase."
4,Too soon to tell,"I am in my 3rd month, I do know it takes about 6 months to see results. I do find it is helping my nails--they are stronger and look so much nicer. I am hoping it will strengthen my fragile hair. I have never had patience to continue with treatments before--I want to see instant results--but I now realize that in order to see any improvement it will take time so I am committed to giving this treatment a chance."
5,Great Flash Cards,"My baby really enjoys all three sets of these black and white flash cards - the jungle collection, the sea collection and farm animals. She really is very interested by them. The art cards are so neat too. Once i'm not using as a mobile anymore they would be suitable for framing or other display. I would recommend to any parent looking for something in the black/white spectrum for their newborn."
2,Two books in one,I had been looking forward to reading about the Lessons learned by a blind person but I was not prepared for Sunday School lessons with each learning experience. I feel the book would have been much better with a little less preaching.
5,A Must Read! - Inspiring and Captivating!,Lessons I learned in the Dark is one of the best books I've ever read. Jennifer uses a humorous style to bring home in very real way how we can find joy in whatever circumstance we are in.Its a wonderful book to give to as a gift - everyone can identify with the lessons she illustrates in this book.I highly recommend it!!
5,Inspiring!,"Loved the book! Inspiring! Unique ""look"" at the lessons learned from loss of sight! I loved the ""play"" on words!"
5,It fits.,"It fit my old McCulloch and now it cuts better than I ever remember it cutting before.I was going to just buy a new chain saw, but this turned out to be a much more economical solution."
3,Doesn't fit a Stihl,"The description says this chain fits a Stihl, but it didn't fit mine (MS 180). The teeth on the inside of the chain are too thick, and don't fit into the groove in the bar."
4,Hubby was fine with this,Hubby wanted this and used it on his chainsaw. Worked well and easy directions for putting on saw. Good price.
5,Magnificent Information,"Overall this book is invaluable! Even someone who has been to NASCAR Race Events will find information that is useful. Some of it is very basic, but all will enjoy the creative insight that Liz Allison has. The term ""Who knew?"" describes a lot of the insider tidbits she offers. This is an absolute ""MUST HAVE"" book for NASCAR fans everywhere!"
3,Girl's Guide to NASCAR,"There are some interesting things in this book, but overall I think it is too basic."
1,Bleh. Couldn't get past the first chapter,Ok--I have a short attention span and this book didn't cut it for me. Guess I'll have to figure out how to teach manners to my ill mannered kids on the fly.
3,"Well written, but the typeface is small",This may be a great book...but the typeface is so small that I get a headache from it. The writing is really good and what I have looked at so far seems to be narrative format and actually enjoyable to read...until my eyes give out....
1,Government Forms turned into a Book,"I read this book on the weight of a connection to W.E.B. Griffen. I will not make this mistake again. There is no denying the author is a great American, hero and inspiration...but he is absolutely not a writer. This book totally lacks any description and at best it could be considered a very dry and boring narrative. The author is so sensitive to the feelings of bit players in his experiences that he never has an unkind word for any of them...at the very most he apologizes for them and I find it hard to believe his military career can be chronicled without personality inefficiencies. By far the most poorly written book I have chosen to read, which is unfortunate because a ghostwriter would have been able to tell a wonderful story."
2,Ages 4 & Up????,"Better for a toddler with good receptive language skills. The concept is good, but the game is not challenging at all for most 4-5 year old with decent coordination. Better for younger kids if they can understand the rules. Either way, the lifespan of this game is short-lived as your kids will outgrow it quickly."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"I bought this dutch oven 13 months ago. I use wooden spoons, and cook on moderate heat. Yesterday, while I was sauteeing onions and mushrooms preparing for a sauce I noticed something white in the onions. The enamel had peeled off, and was breaking up in the pan as I stirred them! When I emptied the pan I saw a spot of iron the size of a nickel sitting next to a dime. That's fairly significant. The pan is unusable. I will be trying to get my money back, or at least let the Rachael Ray people know that there is a problem. Has anybody else had this experience?"
2,I was bored witless.,"I started a policy of viewing major film festival winners, but already regret it with the first one: The Class. It was just painful mundane student-teacher interaction, without any new insights or solutions. The teacher is just as snide and condescending as his students. It's like all personal interaction in France is based on subtle and overt insults.Why didn't the teacher explain that the rules of proper grammar are used socially to mark people as worthy of respect or not? It may not be fair, but that is in fact the primary value of learning grammar, and the students understand lack of respect all too well.I don't get why anyone would think this is a great movie."
1,just a bad movie,"with all the awards and the buzz about it, I thought I am up for a great movie, Boy was I mistaken. It's tasteless, stupid and extremely boring. I asked for my money back and I was denied. The guy who sold it to me, said "" Keep it and i will give you a 50% off your next purchase"" I told him to take it back and to give me back 50% of the price. He replied "" keep it and I will refund your money"". Now I have it and don't know what to do with it. This movie is a scam !! I am planning to mail it back to the production company with a note saying "" Thank you for this awful movie""."
4,Will Watch Again,"""The Class"" makes viewers a fly on the wall in an inner-city french middle school classroom. While the premise may seem mundane at first, nothing about this film is boring. The interactions between the students and the teacher are engaging, if not shocking. The mixture of cultures and the clashes that those differences lead to are done in a very realistic way. You will come away with a better understanding of the french education system and what life is like for educators and students. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this film is the fact that the students are not actors, but real kids; M. Marin is not only a real educator, but wrote the book this film was based on off of his own teaching experiences. The reality of the film is both heartbreaking and entertaining and should be enjoyed by all audiences."
3,Class,"Hi This was an intresting look into French school life, which is not too different from life in the US."
5,great items,It arrived on time in very good shape. I purchased it to offer it to friends and they were very pleased of it.
3,Respectable but hard to actively enjoy,"The Bottom Line:So few movies set in schools are actually about school that I wish I had enjoyed it more, but the fact remains that this plotless journey through one year of a French classroom often feels rambling and less than riveting; I feel like a philistine for finding The Class so dull since I love how much it avoids cliche and formula, but be advised that if you're looking for a fast-moving or intriguing film you should look elsewhere.3/4"
3,Comprehending Incomprehesible,A bit boring long story of a school class as a modern France mirror where teens from around a globe study French and France culture while their teachers try comprehending reasons for allowing so much cheap labour in an already jobless country.
3,Middle of the Road,"This subtitled French film is a blend of pedagogy, human psychology and ethnic sociology. Although the characters themselves are generally appealing, the first half of the movie kind of drags and has many repititious elements. It picks a bit toward the second half, which conveys more of a sentimental and dramatic quality. All in all, a middle of the road viewing experience for me."
5,Beautiful Story,"This movie was wonderful. Although there was really no plot direction, I love the actors, the school, and the teacher. I could have sat down and watched it for an hour longer even though it was purely dialogue."
3,"It's fine, if you have special needs for it....","People ranting about how painfully SLOW Virtual PC is are probably missing the point of the product, really. This isn't supposed to let a Mac user run Windows XP or 2000 comfortably on his/her Mac! It really begs the question of why you spent the $'s on a newer Mac in the first place, if that's what you're trying to accomplish?As one example where VPC *is* indispensable, I do on-site computer service and support for a living. My only laptop is an Aluminum 17"" Powerbook. I have clients who use Novell Netware and Groupwise in a Windows environment, and I have yet to see a native Mac ""console"" for adding/deleting/editing Netware user accounts and Groupwise mailboxes. With VPC (even version 6), I can run Novell's ""ConsoleOne"" and do this work for them from my Powerbook. That's not only ""a good trick"", but saves me from having to own a Windows notebook just to make occasional edits to clients' systems."
1,Endless loop on installlation & missing user support webpage,"After logging in as administrator on my mac, going through the installation program & rebooting, the installation program says to log in as administrator & re-install. It even does this when logged in as the root user. Following the instructions for on-line help, one finds that the 'requested web page is not available', and any help by email or telephone from Microsoft starts at $35."
1,Worst piece of software I have ever bought.,"The program works, but You Might as well be on windows 3.1.It is too slow to be of any productive use. It is a total hype, totallyuseless for business or any application."
2,Could be much better,"extremely slow to boot and run, only run it when I absolutely have to run a program that requires windows."
2,Virtual PC 7 for Mac w/WinXP Pro,"This emulator really bogs down older PowerPC PowerBooks. I constantly experience slowdowns and freezes during operation. (A genuine experience?) Considering the cost of newer netbooks, it may not be worth the money."
5,QUICK DELIVERY AND ALL IN PERFECT CONDITION,It has been a real pleasure to do business with you.Thanks
1,NOT for new Mac Intel Duo Core processor,This software will not run on the new iMac Intel Duo Core Processor. This software runs ONLY on the G5 processor. This is not clear in the Amazon info or other reviews.
3,It works but it is slow,"Bottom line is it does work and is a kool option for a mac...but use it only if you have to for work or play. All programs will run slow and have lag. Forget any real time applications that speed is crutical for. It does run Partypoker and other poker softwares, but you will not be able to keep more than 2 screens open at a time, the lag is to bad. My Ram is upgraded to 1.25 and it does not help, maybe the new itel chips will make the performance better."
4,Virtual PC for Real Estate Use?,"Can I use an Apple 14 iBook 1.33 GHz with 768MB RAM as my Real Estate Platform? In my case (California) I needed to work with two key Windows based programs. Let me call them WinForms and Paragon, the MLS search capability via Internet Explorer. I knew I would need Virtual PC to handle WinForms and it turned out to be mandatory for Paragon, too. WinForms provided no problems from the beginning, but Paragon was a long struggle. Yesterday was a break-through and it is working like a champ. I get instant results from even the most complicated search. The major things I had to do were, upgrade to VPC 7.0.1 and get the ""exact"" configuration of IE instructions from Paragon. The results are spectacular."
3,It's just OK,"I had to purchase Virtual PC for my Mac because of software needs in a statistics class I'm taking. I tried to avoid this purchase as long as I could. Now that it has been installed (it took 3 install efforts) I find it to be slow and clumsy. It is now a part of my computer out of need - not desire. So far it is doing what it is supposed to do, but in the typical Windows non-intuitive manner with a lot of excuses and expectations that are not seen with the Mac OS. I guess it's OK, but I'm not a big fan of having it on my computer. I feel contaminated. If you need this software, it will do the job but no where near as well as what we have grown to appreciate with a Mac."
1,MacBook with the Intel Chip owners Beware,"Virtual PC 7 does not work with the new Intel chip MacBooks. Mac is working on Boot Camp that installs a partition so that both Mac and Microsoft programs can be run, and Microsoft is working on a new version of an emulator that is compatible with the Intel chips, but both will cost extra. None of this appears in the product information of either. I learned this after I purchased a new MacBook Pro and tried to load Virtual PC 7 that I used with my G5."
3,Complete PC Emulator? Not Quite.,"It does a pretty good jub running software, albeit a little slow. But on the box and in the ads it touts itself as a COMPLETE PC emulator. What it doesn't say anywhere in the documentation is that there is no firewire support for devices other than reading and writing to HDs. Complete? Not Quite Microsoft."
1,Do not buy if...,"If your looking to use this product for it's capabilities to run programs that you cannot run on a mac then dont' buy this. If you want to use word, or publisher or any other windows products on your mac just by the mac based software. This product of full of bugs and does not work on certain websites that are essetial to me. Plus, it is slow as all heck."
2,"Virtual, well....","This is great if you're running an older version of the mac OS. It won't run on the new stuff (after OS X 10.3). They don't tell you that ahead of time, and you have to break the seals and try to install to find out Intel cannot be used and Windoze XP can only be used with this version of virtual PC. And MS doesn't support either product anymore. So, unless you are totally desperate, don't bother. BTW I have an unused set which makes a mildly attractive bookend."
3,The price is correct,"Um... the reviewer above seems to confusing the version WITHOUT Windows XP with this version, which INCLUDES XP. The identical copy of the version here is in fact 249.95 on the mac.com site, which means the Amazon price is a savings of about 25 bucks.I'd advise folks who are looking to buy software to look a tad bit closer than the first reviewer."
3,Virtual PC,"I did not have any trouble using Virtual PC, however one problem it has that cannot be avoided is the slow speed the Microsoft OS operates at. While running Windows XP on Virtual PC, it was constantly at 100% usage resulting in very slow response. Eventually I just gave up on it and I don't think this item is worth the frustration of having a slow PC on your Mac."
1,Lack Of Resources,"The problem with this software is video streaming and games. Almost all games and video need a minimum of 32Mb for video. The max this software can do is 16Mb. So, if you are using this jsut for office applications than this is the software for you. If your trying to use games and stream video for surveillance purposes from a pc based dvr with a remote access software it is impossible because you need the 32Mb of video minimum."
1,Don't Bother,"Awful program. Slow. Clunky. The most unstable program your Mac has ever seen. Wait until you attempt to load PC programs on it. Don't bother.You would have to be desperate to actually use it with any frequency.Don't fall for this ""Best of Both Worlds"" pipe dream. Read the horrors about the previous versions. Version 7 is no better."
4,good but slow on certain tasks,It is a good product I have not had to put it through all of its paces. Having written that I did see poor performance on websites that are heavy in games. My youngest was on [...]and the game was slow in comparasion to OS X.
1,Disappointed with this newest version,"DO NOT BUY THE VIRTUAL PC VERISON 7... I was so disappointed with the software because it does not run like it should be. Not even fast for business/home users at all!! I had to reinstall the virtual PC 4 times as, for some reason, it crashed and did not work anymore so I to reinstall it again and again. The last time, I just give up and just decided to buy a pc as the only software that I need is Microsoft money and Dragon Speaking. Dissatisfied with Microsoft."
1,WAY overpriced at 224.00,"All I have to say is that the price on this item far outstrips anything I've seen so far. More than it is at CompUSA, more than it is at mac.com (or the Apple store in person for that matter.)"
1,Buy a cheap PC instead!,"With the cost of this software, you're half way there anyway and the V-PC program is incredibly, mind-numbingly slow (and this is on a new G5 iMac with a gig of ram). There may be some settings or preferences (that I'm not aware of) that might help the speed issue, but it is certainly not plug-n-play like so many of the Mac apps I'm used to. Honestly, I wish I could get my money back."
1,HATED IT,"This is a piece of #*^% !!! Really I felt really taken advantage of . I am operating Mac OS 10.4.7, 2.1 GHz PowerPC G5 Imac. I bought this product to use it in connection with other programs and mainly for use with my Pocket PC phone. It was slower than a snail on dope and kept crashing. I hated it. Really. I feel like the product was made solely to frustrate mac users who need to use pc software in an attempt to generate pc sales. I wish I could get my money back. PS When is mac going to make a smart phone I will buy it immediately"
3,Good and Bad,"I purchased this software and ended up not using it. The reason being it could not run the program I was hoping it would. So my advice is if you are purchasing this emulator for a specific software contact the software maker and ask if it would run on an emulator. The software I was trying to run was Financial stock/account manager. It did not run, and when I contacted the financial institue they said it will not on an pc emulator. it is slow, and perhaps you should think of getting a real pc if you needed more spped. make sure you have at least 1 - 1.5 GB of RAM, along with a fast processor.You can always visit a mac store they usualy have the software installed on some of the in-store apples.Just my .02"
2,not the latest and greatest,"After speaking with a Mac representative, he didn't recommend this software. Maybe he was pulling my leg, but he said virtual Pc isn't the way to go. He said Fusion was the product (around $70), but it doesn't come with windows. oops."
1,How BAD it is...,"This came brand new. But it wouldn't load. It got to a certain point in the installation and locked up. Tried it several times, locked at the same point every time. MICROSOFT NO LONGER SUPPORTS THIS PRODUCT! So if you think you are going to get help from Microsoft with installation issues think again! Apple could not help either as they don't know the product.I would say to just skip this product all together and get VMWare Fusion. It's amazing."
5,Beautiful (and educational) story about bluebirds,"Blue Sky Bluebird, told as a story, describes the lifecycle of bluebirds. Starting with a pair of bluebirds, describes how they build their nest, how the eggs develop and hatch, and how they grow. Mentions migration and shows the three types of bluebirds found in North America. Chrustowski skillfully includes basic zoological information and precise terminology within story (except for the peek inside the egg section, which is outside of the main story). A note at the end mentions the decline and recent resurgence in the number of bluebirds and the increasing number of nest boxes. The illustrations are warm, colorful, and detailed. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
4,Out of print but worth the search!,I have been trying to track down a copy of this book for about three years and finally it panned out. The book is no longer in print which is a shame. The illustrations and beautiful but the storyline exceeds all of this librarians expectations1 book tell the story of the power of books! The vocabulary is beautiful and the metaphorical language lend a powerful image that speaks to the enormous importance of books and reading.
2,Dirty Base,So does the base of this feeder come apart? Yea the glass is easy to clean but the base is very hard and I am about to throw mine in the garbage and buy a No.1 Best feeder.
2,sorry one leaks in plastic base,wanted to like them...greatest reviews online..... hung them both.... cost too much to return and were open and used.... plastic base leaked in a pinhole..... tried to fix and could not
1,design flaw,"Received the one I bought two days ago. But it has a design flaw. I wanted to use it by hanging it and did so. The problem is as long as it is perfectly flat as pictured every thing is OK. But the second it is slightly tilted (as when a breeze come through or a bird uses it) all the ""nector"" runs out and you have a mess on the ground or floor. Been using hummer feeders for years and this is the first one with this flaw. I beleive the flaw is the feeding holes are too big and any tilting outof perpendular breaks the surface tension and all the fluid runs out. Mine is now going in the trash. Barry"
2,Impossible to clean,"I've had this feeder for years and years and have fed many zillions of hummingbirds with it. It doesn't leak, it holds a lot of nectar and as long as you don't lose the yellow flowers for the base bees and ants don't get in (if you lose them you can buy them seperately and replace them) But I'm about to replace this feeder. It is just too much of a pain to clean.The reservoir is very large and made of glass, which is good. But the opening is very small. Its especially a problem if you forget to keep the nectar topped off and mold grows inside -- be prepared to scrub it out with a long handled bottle brush, and then rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse. Rinse some more.The base is even worse. It is full of edges and crevices and the only opening is through very narrow openings in the top. It does not dissassemble. How many wasted hours have I spent trying to get the base clean? I've had enough. I'm getting a humzinger dish-type feeder."
1,Hummingbird Feeder,"This feeder did not have a top or hook to hang it. It did have a wire but???? I had the exact feeder that I liked and it lasted for years, but the feeder had a screw cap on top with a round hook. I returned the feeder and received another with a missing top."
2,Perky-Pet 209,"Having three Perky-Pet feeders, I find the 209 which allows 30 ounces of nectar to be too large. Since it is recommended to change the nectar every three days, I fill it at no more than 25 percent capacity. Also, I find if I fill it more than that, the downward pressure of the nectar forces droplets out of the feeding holes."
4,"Great feeder, one flaw",I really like this feeder- the only flaw is it is difficult to clean. I use a toothbrush and it works pretty well.
5,the birds keep coming back.,this provides a good device to help the little hummers out. attendance at the wet bar has been high. pleasure to see the variety of types that use it.
1,Leaking feeder,We have had several of these feeders and have never had a problem until now. The two halves of the lower pastic bowl wern't welded together ( or sealed )and leaked like a sieve. After taking it apart and gluing the two halves together it no longer leaks. There appears to be a small o-ring inside which did no good whats so ever since it's ends didn't meet. We have always used these feeders and this is the first time we've had this sort of a problem. We will continue to buy them but be more careful and test them when first using them.
2,. . . . . DOA!,"This product arrived broken, in suspicious packaging. Please see my review on Birdscapes 279 Deluxe Rose Petal 12-ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder."
5,Best hummingbird feeder on the face of the earth,"5 stars is not a high enough rating, I give this feeder a 10 star. The hummers will actually land on the perch railing which surrounds this feeder and feed for 1-2 minutes giving you a chance to really see these tiny marvels. Well constructed, cleaning is a snap, I will buy 3-4 more to hang around the property."
5,Beautiful Hummingbird Feeder,"I love this feeder, my yard is swarming with hummingbirds! It is a really good size, holds a lot of nectar and is made of sturdy glass. The perch is great because many birds can enjoy at the same time. I love having these beautiful creatures in my yard!"
2,Best available but doesn't last,Have owned this feeder for three years and the plastic rail around the bottom has busted off due to detioriation from the sunlight. Probably would be worth buying at a lower price.
2,Not that great,"I did look this product over at a local hardware store.My husband saw an antique glass feeder that was being sold next to this one and we bought that instead and it works great. Important things to remember about feeders is that you need to be able to clean them every 3 or 4 days at the latest. Hummingbirds are delicate so its really important to keep to a cleaning routine. I make my own nectar 4 pts water(2 cups) with 1 part organic sugar(1/2 cup). You boil it for 1 to 2 minutes, then cool and put in the fridge. Fills a glass feeder twice. I change usually on Sundays and Wednesdays. The hummingbird comes all the time. They are such wonderful creatures. Also,please don't add red food coloring. You do not need it to attract them and its also potentially damaging. I place the feeder among my bleeding heart bushes.The bird frequents the feeder all day long."
3,hummingbird feeders,"have used this type for years and when they get old, i mean real old they start to leak. i just bought 2 more and one is fine and the other one started leaking in 2 1/2 weeks.when they leak that draws wasp, then the birds won't come around. they are still the best ones i have found i just got a dud this time"
4,humming bird feeder initial review,"since it is too early to actually put it out, my review is based on my first reaction to receiving it. it looks to be exactly as described and easy to use. i hope that it draws in the area humming birds. i look forward to the first time that i will see them using it."
3,I like this product,I like the product being glass and so do the hummers. It would be nice to see PP improve the rim or perch to a more durable one as it becomes flemsy and easily breaks away from the base over time. Also the the yellow ports should be changed to red so as to discourage bees.
4,great deal,"great deal, hard to clean, like the glass, i bought two knowing i would have a hard time cleaning the base.will buy again the birds love it. i have three or more birds feeding all the time."
4,This is a GOOD feeder!,"I have tried a BUNCH of different feeders over the years, and this is one of the best. Difficult to clean, true, because the base cannot be dis-assembled. You have to pop the flowers off and use a q-tip to swab the area under them to thoroughly clean this feeder.But the birds LOVE it, and the capacity is decent.I currently use two of these, along with several others.The big 72 ounce feeder cleans VERY easily, but the birds don't like it.So who are we feeding for, the birds or for our convenience?"
5,we love hummingbirds and they love us,"very good feeder, only problem is, that it gets emptied in just a couple of days, hummingbirds love this feeder. anybody got a coupon for sugar? LOL"
5,Great price and fast delivery,"After reading an article on how the design of this hummingbird feeder does NOT allow bees or wasps to drink from it (which is a real problem where I live), I researched the price and found this to be a terrific buy and then the feeders arrived so quickly!! They work too. I use some of the old feeders just to help the honey bees, but now the hummers don't have to do battle for their nectar."
1,leaky feeder,the feeder holds the large amount of liquid i need to feed the hummingbirds but the bottom keeps falling off and all my liquid keeps pouring out onto the ground. not to happy about that.
2,hard to clean,"hard to take apart the base. And the glass bottle has a VERY narrow opening. All in all, difficult to clean. Not recommended."
1,Design blocks birds and it leaks,"I already had a Best Hummingbird feeder and dumb me I took a chance on this one. First of all it has a design flaw. The hummers around here are a bit shy at times and will ""hide"" on the other side. You can't see them. My other feeder has a glass bottle like this one, but a flat base, you can see the birds on the far side.It also leaks out of the seam and has to be returned.I wish I had another hand so I could give it three thumbs down.Get this kind instead:Best-1 32 Ounce Hummingbird Feeder"
2,Not for me,"Was a pin to me seeing ants infest the nectar I like the ones that have a any mote MUCH better,I bought this and one tha has the ant mote at the same time,and the ant mote one ..was by far better for our needs"
5,fantastic humming bird feeder,I love this and it is the right size so you don't have to refill it daily.
1,Perky Pet 209 Hummingbird Feeder,"We purchased this hummingbird feeder last year for a spare and it has been hanging in storage until we needed it. Yesterday we decided to put it up since we have an abundance of ""hummers"" all of a sudden and much to our chagrin it immediately started leaking from two spots on the plastic bottom. It was brand new, never in contact with anything, just hanging up waiting until we needed it, and it started leaking immediately upon filling. We have had many hummingbird feeders and never had this problem. I would have asked for a refund but it has been a while since we ordered it, I guess we should have tried it out immediately just to test it but like mentioned, we never thought of it since it was new. I would not recommend this feeder for this reason."
1,"VERY POOR DESIGN!!! YOU CLAIM,""This is your BEST product?","VERY POOR DESIGN!!! If I were you, I would be ASHAMED to say, ""This is our BEST PRODUCT"". Only fills from one TINY hole, in the bottle. You MUST use a FUNNEL to add the nectar. This is a PAIN. Also, because the fill hole is SO SMALL, BOTTLE IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CLEAN OF DRIED SUGAR & gets STICKY. GLASS LOOKS DIRTY, ALL OF THE TIME. VERY EASY TO DROP & BREAK. In addition, bees amd wasps are naturally attracted to the color YELLOW. So, what color did they make the flowers? YELLOW!!! MAKES NO SENSE. ALSO, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOOK? They give you a THIN PIECE OF WIRE, YOU HAVE TO BEND and fashion your own hook. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. YOU'LL SEND IT BACK! WORST I've purchased yet."
1,please! buy a different feeder!,"i have bought many a hummingbird feeder, and this one i will not use or even pass on to someone else to use: it is impossible to clean the plastic element.sugar water sitting outside in the sun soon develops mold, and this feeder actually encourages dangerous mold growth because it cannot be disassembled for cleaning.if you really care about hummingbirds, make a 1 part sugar to 4 parts water food WITHOUT the red food coloring, and put it in a feeder than can be thoroughly cleaned.i sincerely hope the manufacturers of this item will redesign the base compartment so that it can be separated for occasional scrubbing; or that some enterprising individual will take up the challenge (make the bottle neck opening a little wider, too, to allow entry for a bottle brush). then we'll really have the 'best' feeder, and so will the hummingbirds."
1,50% defect rate,"Purchased two feeders late lat year. This spring I noticed one of the two now leaks at the seam between the top and bottom portions of the base which is below the liquid level. No abuse or freezing, just leaks now. Soft slippery plastic is impossible to glue so feeder is junk."
1,Last two Perky Pet 209 useless..top didn't fit.,"I purchased two more of these feeders because the hummingbirds emptied the 8 oz feeders (which I prefer because of ease of cleaning) with in 4 to 6 hours. The last two Perky Pet 209 feeders were useless, the top didn't fit, the tops had to be forced on and now won't come off. The tops would not screw on as they should, and of course won't screw off now. I would have returned them but I made the mistake of shredding the invoice.As mentioned by someone else in another review, the bottom feeder portion is impossible to clean. I take them apart every night now and rinse out the top with hot water and leave it soaking in clean water all night. I am not sure how long this will keep mold away though. I have purchased two types of brushes for cleaning feeders and they are both useless too. Don't waste your money on the perky pet mop, or the other brushes Amazon sells that come in a set of three different sizes."
1,Leaks...,"2nd one I have bought, the first one lasted 6 months, the second one lasted two months. The plastic bottom leaks, purchase at your own risk."
1,Bird Feeder Leaks,This was a Christmas gift and now just 3 months later the feeder is leaking around all the flowers...totally useless. I have used this same type of feeder before and never had a problem like this.
1,pesky perky pet feeder,"I ordered this thinking that the bottle fill opening would be as wide as the picture indicated, but it wasn't. The opening to fill is about 1/2-3/4"" wide and hard to fill. I had to use a funnel. Yuk. Would not have purchased if I had known that. But, the large size bottle is nice."
5,Best hummingbird feeders I've found,"Live them, easy to clean, great price, free shipping. I buy several at a time due to all the hummingbirds I get every year. Highly recommend this product."
5,good price,"good price for well-known item.If you don't want to clear it with bleach.Roll up 1/2 sheet of paper towel.Slide it in with soap and water, shake and spin the towel around the inside of the feeder well.Rinse several times; as you spin the water around the towel should be easy to grab and pull out."
2,"Great capacity, difficult to clean ports","Here's a great solution for the bleach debate - OxyClean or OxOBrite (latter is Trader Joe's brand). It's non-toxic and safe for the environment and I would surmise a safer alternative to bleach for hummingbird feeders, yet, works like a charm. Hydrogen Peroxide works well too, but the foaming action of these products helps a bit. These products loosen that muck around the ports, but you really need a Droll Yankee port brush (GREAT PRODUCT!) or a toothbrush to really get rid of that black gunk. It's not possible to get at the inside of the ports with this feeder and that worries me. The saucer type feeders are by far the easiest to clean thoroughly. I have eight saucer feeders so I need EASY TO CLEAN as my #1 priority. This one will be a spare for when I go on a trip and need to stretch my visiting hummers' nectar needs beyond 2 days."
4,Great feeder!,Easier to keep clean than the plastic kinds and large capacity for people who have to refill alot. Small neck makes it a little difficult to clean. I had one with a larger neck that I liked better but I broke it. Overall a good feeder.
2,Could be just what I wanted...,"I believe this to be a very nice humminbird feeder, however. mine arrived in 50+ pieces due to the packing. It was simply placed in a box along with a book that I had ordered; there was no padding around it. The box was in tact, but even the book cover was scratched because of the broken glass slipping out of the feeder's box. I am dissapointed in Amazon for taking such little care in their packaging.[[ASIN:B00004RA8P Perky-Pet 209 Our Best 30-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder)]"
5,"great feeder, here's some tips...","the feeder is great, no problems, minimal mess.*don't put food coloring in bird food, just use sugar and water. hummingbirds still come*you may need to use some sort of water ""moat"" to protect from ants. be prepared for that.*when taking it down to empty or change food, keep it level- or else syrup will spill out.*enjoy watching the birds!"
2,Used to be better,"We have used Perky Pet hummingbird feeds for years. We get so many birds, we have always chosen this larger feeder; they still ran out daily due to the number of birds. Wanted to replace an old one so we ordered this one. It is not made as well as the old ones and the opening for the water is not as large and my funnel will not fit in it."
4,Big and Pretty,"This feeder is very large. It holds twice as much nectar as my old feeders. I had a problem of larger birds and bees taking nectar from my old feeders, this solved the problem. I am now bee, and regular bird, free! The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because of the poor design for hanging the feeder and the lack of instructions. They give you a short and straight 'cord' but there's no instructions on how to apply it as a hanger to the red cap on top of the feeder. I figured it out but it does not seem very secure. They need to include a stainless steel washer to spread the load under the center of the red cap. Aside from that, I'm very happy with the feeder, and I would most certainly recommend it."
4,"No Frills, Low Tech, Works!","This feeder started attracting hummingbirds quickly. Very basic construction, but sturdy. Good size. Very easy to assemble, but I would have liked some instructions just to be sure. Something that told how to make the correct sugar/water mixture and what to watch for in bird behavior would have been nice to have as well. Also would have liked the plastic hanger to be a bit longer."
4,Well...,"For about $5 you get two pouches. They zip around the top and a few inches down the sides. They're nylon mesh so they work well when it comes to protecting things from scratches. I use them to store the modules that go with my Inspiron 600m notebook. The modules are 5x5x0.5 and so I will be investing in more snug cases, or foam padding. Essentially, get these if you have things that you just want to throw some accessories in a pouch to separate them from all your other stuff. I use another one of these when I take my AC adaptor out with me. Oh, another thing, the pouches are pretty much the same in design but one is small enough to fit into the larger one. They come packaged with one serving as the filler for its larger companion."
4,A Romantic Mystery,"This takes the spy category to a different level. It is more a celebration of love and Venice than of terror and death, and it makes for a great read."
5,Pole Saw Chain,I had been looking for a chain to fit my Remington pole saw. I found this one on Amazon and at a very good price. Great Deal.
3,Remington pole saw use...or not....,Bought this for a Remington Pole saw and it's a little looser than the original chain...may want to check on the S39 chain...still works but takes more adjustments...still a good buy...
5,"10"" chain for my Tanaka pole saw","Ordered 4 of these for my Tanaka pole saw. Hard to find locally, but priced right on Amazon. Shipped fast, and work like a charm. I am a commercial landscaper so these get used weekly on my various properties. Good value."
4,Got this for the Greeworks chainsaw,Fits and works as well as or better than the one that came with the saw. The only problem is that a short chain like this wears faster than a long one. Not a problem with the product - just a fact and limitation of short bar saws.
2,Difficulty with this company,"I begain my first attempt to get this safe on 5/28 within a couple of weeks I recieved the product which was moderately damaged. I returned it and 2 weeks later the exact same damaged safe was deivered. the 3rd safe I recieved was also moderately damaged. Edges smashed in, and while the door would open and lock, it definately lost its water/fire proof capabilities. I am still attempting to get the return fed ex paperwork from Eli the manager at home and beyond. He offered me 30.00 off and I told him I wouldn't take anything less than 50%. Now I just want my money returned so that I can go to a store and purchase a safe. This item weighs 89 pounds and I am sure it takes a beating down the conveyor belt. I would suggest that if you cant get a purchased item to a customer in good shape than you should remove that item for your catalogue. I love Amazon and this is the first time I have had trouble with a merchant like this.Sincerely,Lisa M Bach-Bohler"
2,Very difficult to open,"I made the mistake to order the one with No over ride key and no automatic keypad. The lock it came with was very hard to operate, and honestly I was afraid as some reviewers stated , that one day I would not be able to open it up. The size would have been perfect, but the locking mechanism is not the easiest, especially I also thought of when you get older , have trouble seeing the number display.Will look for one with an over ride key and a touch key pad."
3,Okay...,"Discovered I could get one of equal size and specifications with a digital lock, instead of the turnstile one, for equal price at a store down the street for me. The locking mechanism and door seal seems a little ""iffy"" to me as far as its ability to withstand fire and water. It is heavy enough though, that anyone who tries to take it should really have their work cut out for them, especially if you bolt it to the floor with the provided equipment."
3,Not as good as it's made out to be.,"First of all, the floor bolting system is ridiculous. The instructions are useless so I called customer service and I still don't understand how to bolt it to the floor without corrupting the integrity of the fire and waterproof aspects of the safe. It's a huge design flaw that if I was aware of beforehand I would not have bought this safe.Secondly, the wheel of the safe is flimsy. When turned the gearing mechanism sounds strained and non-fluid."
1,Combination doesn't work,"Bought this product brand new and upon opening it I couldn't get it open. Called Sentry and they said sometime sthe pins don't work properly. So to get is open, I have to dial the first number 3 times, second number twice and last number once. This works most of the time."
1,"Dont buy safe online, buy at home depot","This safe is pretty crapy, for one it cost 30 dollars more than if i was to buy it at homedepot and the safe at home depot had shelving to it which i thought this safe did, then i called sentry and they said the shelving cost 20 dollars thats means i would have an addtional of 40 dollars into the safe for the two shelves that home depot has, another thing is the safe look crappy, dont even look like it can hold a 5 feet fall, let only the combo is pretty ridiculous dont have any color to it, really big, takes about 45 sec to just open it up, thats way to much time in case i need to get to my gun, i would recommend staying away from sentry and go for some other safeSentry DS0200 Safe 1 Hour Fireproof Combination Safe, 0.8 Cubic Feet, Black"
5,"Hooray! Here's a pocket-sized ""I Love Lucy"" pick-me-up.","Here's the most clever little ""Lucy"" book around. Truly the perfect gift for anyone who ever enjoyed ""I Love Lucy."" Cleverly written by Elisabeth Edwards with Lucie Arnaz and full of classic ""Lucy"" moments. This one's an absolute winner!"
5,great compiltation of pictures and sayings,"i loved the little Guide to Life Book. Took it to work, and when the day started going down hill, looked at a few pages, laughed and felt much better."
2,Just a waste of money,"First of all you need a Magnifieglass just to read the book because its so darn small! The ""words of wisdom"" are corny.The only good thing about this book is the pictures.Spend your money on an other selection."
3,Fun book!,"I was a little disapointed in the size, but the person I bought it for is going to love it!"
1,Bait and Switch,Bait and Switch!!! The one in the photo is not the one you will get!!! The one in the photo has the better 110 Punchdown tool that you can replace the tip when it gets dull #70012. You get the non replacable one #70034.They should update this photo. Damn misleading!!!!!
2,It's not what is pictured/described,"This is indeed #70016. However what I got is not what is pictured! The punch tool is not the model where you can replace the blade. And they only gave me 10 RJ45s. The promised 10 RJ11s are not in there.I'll raise it one star if Amazon rectifies this situation quickly. I have no reason to believe they won't*However, you're better off getting this 70007 package:Paladin Tools 70007 Complete Network Tool KitIt's cheaper and has the same exact tools as the #70016 does now and it comes with the handy case.*Update: Amazon did indeed take care of me, so 2 stars. You're better off getting 70007 instead, though."
4,Handbook of Composites,"This is book provides a comprehensive overview of composites, both their production and their properties. The book considers the composites' microstructure and its effect on the composites' material properties. However, it is a relatively old book, and some of the properties shown maybe out of date. A newer edition (if there is one) would be helpful."
1,NEVER RECIEVED!!!,I ordered this seat cover over a year ago...they kept saying it was out of stock and wanted to know if I still wanted it and I always replied YES!!!! And NEVER DID RECIEVE IT!!!!
5,Bly Shares His Genius with Us Once Again,"Poet Robert Bly has once again graced us with his words, beautiful poems from his heart to ours. How can one read these and not be touched by his humanity, romance and wonder. A wonderful, wise book!"
3,"robrt bly, honey of words","I like Bly,,,, in reality this may not be his best book, but he has no bad ones."
3,I Agree,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Pretty but not particularly challenging the way Bregovic playing Bregovic is. However, it is a pleasant enough background for relaxing around the house in the evening and playing low during a dinner party or a seduction. Weirdly it sounds more like 'film music' than his actual film music does."
3,Good Light Duty Chain,"This is a good, cheap, light duty chain. It is not for heavy duty use. It will stay sharp for about one yard clean up. It is easy to resharpen and wears well. You should probably buy two, if you wish to always have a sharp blade on hand.It fit my Homelite 16"" just fine."
2,Does not fit Poulan 3516F,"Too bad I did not read one of the comments that says that this chain, S56 does not fit Poulan 3516F even though it is listed as a fit both on Oregon site and on the box. This chain is at least one link too long for this saw and cannot be tightened."
1,This S56 does NOT fit the Poulan,But the Oregon S55 does. I know...it says Poulan on the package but it's too long...waste of money...S55 doesn't say Poulan on the package but it fits the Poulan just fine. Amazon (and Oregon) really need to straighten this out.
2,lasted about 4 hours,"So I got this to chop up some very stikery bushes and it worked well for a few hours then the chain started falling off, well after I put it back on it just kept falling off every 15 minutes. The next day I tried again and found out why it kept slipping, the chain was already worn out. I was pleased with this at first, good price, fit my chainsaw but now I think its just cheep crap."
1,Not for 14 inch Poulan,"This only applies to the 14 inch version. I bought one of these at Tractor Supply as a replacement. Within 5 minutes of use, it slung off the bar. I looked it over and it wasn't damaged. Tried again, paying special attention to the tensioning screw. It slung off the bar again. Damaged the tracks this time.I returned it and got another. Meanwhile, I got the original sharpened and used it for a few months. Time for a spare again. So the Oregon chain went back on and what do you know - slung it off the bar twice. I know how to mount a chain. This one doesn't fit for some reason. Didn't bother returning it. Recycled it."
2,Saw Blades,"The blades seems to be reconditioned sharpened blades. There were not new, they were dull after about about 45 mins of uses on dry wood. I will not purchase any in the future. The four dollars savings is not worth the quality hit you take in performance."
4,Good Value for the Price,"I had been buying chain replacements for my Craftsman 16"" chain saw from Sears for around $25. Even after paying for shipping I still saved about 30% with these chains. Not sure why but the Sears has 57 links (S57) versus the S56 for the Oregon chains."
4,"Good, Quick Read","Having grown up during the hey day of the Rat Pack I was looking for an inside view of what life was like for Frank, Dean, Sammy, etc. and wasn't dissapointed by this book. What I came to realize was Frank was definately the leader of this band of guys, Dean was not at all like Frank and the other guys just followed along pretty much doing whatever Sinatra wanted them too.Most of my generation heard rumors of Sinatra's relationship with the mob and JFK and if I'm to believe this book, most of it was true. It almost seems as if Kennedy was a secret member of the Rat Pack. Of course, things were different in those days as far as what the media reported or was allowed to report so nobody knew what was really going on and this book does, I feel, a nice job of detailing the relationship of all involved.I'd recommend this book to anyone who was or is a fan of this era or any of these performers."
4,A little bit of a lot...and it swings!,"""Rat Pack Confidential"" is an impressive mix of moods, ideas, styles and topics, a history of American pop culture and the souls of some spectacular entertainers. In following Sinatra, Dean Martin,Sammy Davis and Peter Lawford over a number of years, the author gives us a peek into the worlds of show business, organized crime and backroom politics. The style is brassy and lively and witty. There's a big dose of gossip and a lot of insight into the Rat Pack's music and movies. It's not groundbreaking, but it's very breezy. And it makes you believe that a bunch of grown-up baby-men in Las Vegas actually stood for something important in American history. I dug it."
5,A Right Rippin' Read!!,"Whatever you do don't let the recent HBO special put you off the subject - Rat Pack Confidential takes the rise and fall of Frank, Sammy, Dean et. al. and puts it in the context of 20th Century America right up to the 50's and 60's. Marilyn, Ava, The Mob, The White House, Vegas, Civil Rights... Not only that but it takes you into the ins and out of stories that were up until now only legend... That Frank introduced Marilyn and Jack, that Frank acted as the go between for The Mafia's ""help"" to JFK during the 1960 presidential campaign, the Mob and Vegas... Thankfully though it also vividly illustrates the individual histories of the players involved and the interdynamics of one of entertainment's most adored cliques. My only (small) criticism would be Shawn Levy's major adoration syndrome when it comes to Ol' Blue Eyes that sometimes it means he papers over his more obvious character flaws... All in all though a ripping read for a biography."
3,Rat Pack Confidential,"I was surprised to learn this is a compilation of the various books alreadypublished - . I stayed with the book to its end but was not completely soldon its premise that it was going to be something new. If a reader has not read the various biographies of the Rat Pack this is a good start,"
3,Confusing writing style...,"Lots of great info in here on the Rat Pack. However, it seemed like the author was trying to find his identity. Used a lot of big words I had to look up (and I have been in education for a long time) almost like someone recommended he use a thesaurus..On the other hand author will use common speech and profanity. Feels like Levy is trying to reach different audiences and in so doing can't find his own writing style. That said, once you get past that lots of great stuff on the Rat Pack and their exploits. Takes away a lot of the romanticism involving the guys and brings forward reality."
3,Repetition of other sources of information,"There were some interesting things in this book, however, most of what I read about the Rat Pack and their lives, is just a combination of several other books out there. These guys were a legend in and of themselves, mostly Dean, Frank & Sammy, so whatever is written about them (be it fact or fiction) is still fascinating."
2,Kitty Kelly Rehash,"The only reason I gave this a generous 2 stars is for the novelty of the one or two anecdotes that I haven't read before. Other than that, if you have read any of the billion books on FS and/or the Rat Pack, you have read all of this time and time again. Shawn Levy must have spent most of his time xeroxing pages from ""My Way"" by Kitty Kelly as every incident, quote, etc., that she had in her book is here AGAIN. There is always going to be some overlap in these types of books, but there is so much carbon copy in this one, Mr. Levy should be ashamed of himself. Good for those getting their feet wet in Rat Pack lore and gossip I suppose, but a waste of time for anyone who knows more than 4 Sinatra/Dino/Sammy songs."
3,uber-sleazy,"My interest in the Rat Pack comes from a more Swingers/lounge cool kitschy angle. I expected the drinking, womanizing, etc. but the up-to-it-past-his-neck with the Mob and the whole sordid Kennedys-Monroe connections honestly makes you want to take a shower after reading this book. It's a great book, don't get me wrong, but be prepared for the worst."
4,Rat Pack Confidential,"I found this book to be enlightening and enjoyable, filling in some gaps in my knowledge of the Rat Pack. It did, however, suffer from something that happens fairly often in popular histories, and that is a shading of facts to fit the premise of the book. In this case, the premise is that ""It's Frank Sinatra's world, we're just living in it"". Author Shawn Levy makes that point over and over again at every turn, sometimes making bold statements about Frank's superior style or entertainment abilities, which really was unnecessary and took away from the book, in my opinion.All-in-all, a good and informative read for Rat Pack fans."
2,Sound quality not good,When I buy a CD the sound quality of the recording is my first concern. This version is obviously a disappointment. The strings sounds vague and distant. Bad you can't verify sound quality from Amazon's samples.
1,Resinol edicated Ointment,The resinol salve I remember as a child was brown in color and had a herbal odor. This product does not seem to have the same ingredients I remember.
4,Good for diaper rash,"My parents in law gave us the first bottle and it works great and fast on diaper rash. After couple uses, you can see the diaper rashes get better."
5,It's About Time!!!!,"The best TV drama series, EVER! Never a dull moment in this show! Intrigue, lies, manipulation, sexual tension, covert anonymity and the world of terrorism you didn't want to admit existed prior to 9/11. Its un-nerving because many of the series' storylines were based on themes too close to the truth! All of this and a great cast who bring the characters to life. ""Alias"" is a total rip off of LFN, shame on them! I can't wait till I get this DVD set. I hope the remaining seasons don't take as long to be released. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
5,I Love the La Femme Nikita series.,I was so happy to get La Femme Nikita second season. It arrived in a prompt manner and in excellent condition. The price was also very attainable for me. Thank you for wonderful service.
5,"Miracle of MIracles.....Let's pray they make them all, now","I am one of the lucky ones that has the second season, already. I hope this is the start of the release of all the rest of the seasons.....FINGERS CROSSED...EVERYONE."
1,How Can You Rate What You Can't Buy?,"I see that I am not alone sharing feelings of betrayal. My wife and I were looking forward to obtaining Season II of LFN however Warner Brothers appears to lack a sense of loyalty to the most important people of all - consumers. It is shocking in this day and age of people copying music and movies, that WB could be as blatantly disloyal as they appear by ticking off an existing market place. Real fans of the show WANT originals, not copies, and those characters in Nikita deserve their share of the resultant income. Could that be the problem, WB? The very least you owe we faithful is an honest explanation, and if the delay is contractual in nature and not of your doing, advise us accordingly."
1,Check Bookstores for copies of season 2,"As a former bookstore clerk, I know they're not always speedy when it comes to returning recalled merchandise. I called my local bookstore/multimedia chain, and lo and behold, they have copies and 1 is now on hold under my name.I urge all LFN fans who want this season to visit those big chain stores, be nice, and ask if they might have a copy out back."
1,Are you kidding me....???????,"This is such bull!!!! I preordered this and now my order was cancelled? I'm so dissapointed, I'm not interested in purchasing any of the other seasons. Shame on Amazon!"
3,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have finally finished watching the second season and it was worth the wait. Only had one problem,where is the gag reel? Is it on one of the disc? If so, will someone let me know which one.E-mail me at mhjones@shermanisd.net.Can't wait until June 28th, just hope that there is no delay this time."
1,Rumors and Release?,"The Rumors about Garbage and the WB and royals are so many and so well know that there most be some true to them and that is why Nikita season 2 was pull from shelves. (Profiler fans have to deal with the loss of episode 4 from season 1 because the royality cost they'd have to pay to Sting for the use of the song ""Every Breath You Take"" where to high. The verson of the song use is not sung by Sting and/or The Police).TV shows should just stop using popular music in their shows. It's not as if anyone is watching just to hear their music. In this oversaturated media world, artists should be a little more grateful for the use of the work.In ten years which is more likely, Nikita fans once again rewatching an episode from their collection or a pop album from 10 years still being play?I'm sure the bootlegging of Cult TV shows will still be going strong."
1,Goddess Kali,"I wasn't happy with this product. It was damaged as were seasons 1,3,4 and 5, which I sent back. I thought it was really badquality not the series but the dvds and cases the dvds fit into. The boxes they were delivered in were in perfect condition.I don't recommend this product."
1,Terrible packaging.,"La Femme Nikita, Season 2, I would rate at least 4 stars, however the box set I received from Amazon was in pieces. 2 of the 3 disc trays had come loose from the spine creating a totally unacceptable box set. As a result I am deducting 3 stars for the abysmal packaging which necessitated the purchase of a new case for storage."
5,La Femme Nikita - The Complete Second Season,The order was shipped and received in just a few days. I didn't expect it for a couple of weeks. I'm impressed.
4,Found my copy on a store shelf. . .,"I had no problems at all playing mine. No disks defective, and they ran in both my computers, and my extremely cheap DVD player. It could be that a batch or two were defective causeing a recall of the entire lot, but I dunno, as mine worked fine.As usual with Warner Brothers dvd sets, the transfer quality is ABYSMAL. If you were lucky enough to have quality digital cable when B5 was showing on Sci-fi or TNT, you'd have a MUCH higher quality showing than off the dvds. (B5 mentioned because it is also a warner product that suffers from TERRIBLE transfer.) There are compression artifacts, extreme film graininess, and other telltale signs that likely they should have stayed down at 3 eps per disk, not stretch it to 4. Still, the series is very good."
3,RARE 1970's FILMATION STUDIOS CARTOON!,"I bought this DVD hoping that it was an old TV show I remember, and it was! Yay!Finding info on this title was near impossible. IMDB has it listed incorrectly as a TOM & JERRY episode that has the same title.This DVD is actually 4-5 episodes of the 1970's animated TV series FRAIDY CAT by Filmation Studios. Only the FILMATION logo at the beginning is missing. The disc also includes a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon as a bonus.The picture quality is pretty bad, as with all the other DVD released by this company (very very grainy, lots of VHS to DVD transfer errors, etc), but considering how hard it is to locate the majority of Filmation's cartoon library these days, I cant really complain, some is better than none!IF you are looking for RARE 1970's cartoons, and dont mind the bad transfer, then grab this Filmation classic, otherwise, stick with the tons of Disney fare available on DVD."
1,Seems like a budget title to me.,"This dvd looks like one of those versions you would find in a .99 cent store. If you are a Fraidy cat fan and want an official and nice picture/sound version the only one I seen is on the Frightfully Funny Collection Volume 2. Just do an Amazon dvd search and it'll come up. It's still for sale but could go out of print at any time. You also get 2 more discs, one of Groovie Goolies and Ghostbusters, two other filmation shows."
1,good kid..bad choices,OK..Book was not what I was looking for..not enough information about good kids making bad choices.......perhaps some will like but was not what I expected...
1,A pamphlet would have done the same job,"If you have never thought at all about teaching and know absolutely zilch about teaching, maybe this book is for you. Or, if you are terribly incompetent, you might need this book to tell you extremely basic things. I am very disappointed with this book, because I was expecting it to tell me things that weren't completely obvious. Sure, there are a few issues brought up that I might not have thought about without prompting, but prompting is about all the book gives, because there is no real insight. Okay, maybe I'm not being fair to the book, but don't bother with it unless you feel like you are completely clueless and need your hand held through extremely basic concepts. If you have ever even taken a foreign language class, this book is probably too basic for you."
3,not the best moka album out there....,"this album has ""studio"" sound all over it! moka has taken a step back and didnt do his own beats this time. yeah, moka's lyrics have dummied down from previous ventures--the beats are tight, but not a lot of head-nodding tracks.ive read interviews about this album and i knew he was trying to reach for a wider appeal and right then i thought LDS! but, not at all...the album really falls short in terms of time. theres not a track on here that hits 4 min and there are only 13; im not used to listening to a moka album and wondering why its so short--or even feeling empty! the majority of his albums have a theme, and theyre never pop--but this one reaches there.the only track i dislike is ONE TIME, and i will probably skip HUNDRED GRAND...still, this is a decent pickup if ur a true moka fan. people salt on all the singin, but mokes been doin that for awhile now--so it should be no suprise."
1,poor packing,"This Item does not work, it was out of the orignal package and was flying all over the big box it was in! It was crashed by the big grill that I had ordered!"
2,Not enough heat for a flower pot smoker,"We bought this burner to be the heating element for the flower pot smoker from Alton Brown's Good Eats. We may have a larger pot than was used in the show, but were only able to get the temp up to 140 degrees. This is after separating the element from the base, so the temp sensor or safety shutoff would not be affected by the heat. It will be useful for my wife's soap making, but for our smoker, it's on to a higher wattage burner."
5,A gift to an Aunt,Haven't heard any response on this item from my aunt but I'm pretty much sure she enjoys the product. Haven't heard any complaints or bad remarks from her.
5,Simply amazing,"This Elvis figure is INCREDIBLE. The detail is great and it looks just like Elvis. His guitar he is holding is beautiful and looks realistic as well. The figure isn't very articulated. I think he can only move at the neck, shoulders and wrists. But, I didn't get this figure in hopes of being able to pose him. He's more just for display, so the lack of articulation doesn't bring the figure down at all.The paint job and color is fantastic, I really like it. The sculpting is awesome too, you can see the veins in his neck and hands! This figure is just full of emotion and I love it. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Elvis."
2,"Caused the cat to have one of its ""turns""...","In my day, publishing such a thing would have resulted in forced cold showers for all concerned, followed by a brisk rub down with a salted brillo pad from matron.Draft them all into the army, get some old-fashioned discipline and a sense of what it is to be a man, that's what I say!Although...when I think back to some of the barrack-room antics old ""Sticky"" Carstairs used to get up to, perhaps that isn't advisable in this case.Quite liked the cover though."
2,Hard to clean...,"I had this hummingbird feeder. The birds used it, but the feeder was very difficult to keep clean. It tended to get mold in all those little nooks and crannies. In hot weather, you need to change the sugar water every 3-4 days. Choose a hummingbird feeder that is easy to clean."
2,"does the job, but doesn't last","This feeder works well, but I'm now looking for a non-plastic feeder. The plastic base has already cracked and made it very difficult to screw the glass container back into. Flimsy product. Try something more long-lasting. This product lasted less than one year and now is only good for the landfill."
4,Almost 5 Star,"Solid Stainless Steel look and finish. Lives up to it's description and is sturdy and attractive. The flaw is in the wire shelves. If you place heavy items at the ends of the shelves, they bend. The ends of the sehlves should have been long enough to rest on a lip that should have been part of the inside edge of the rack. Make sure you secure unit to wall studs as directed. Installation was reasonable. If you use a power drive or drill attachment, be careful not to strip the screw head. If you use it to hang baskets, make sure the radius of the basket is narrower than the depth of the shelf, or the basket will rest on the wall."
3,"OK, but not great","This book was released just after SQL 2005 was released. So the author probably had to write much of it while SQLS 2005 was still in flux.In a few cases, the information does not appear to match the final release, and the screen shots are hard to read (too small).But for the most part, the book still has some value. It is a good introduction to sql server and, overall, an easy read."
2,Good in parts - too many errors,"Overall this book is a good introduction to SQL server. However the book has too many errors relating to the sample database. The entire section dealing with joins, references table columns that do not exist in the Adventure Works sample database. Additionally there are random mistakes throughout the rest of the book regarding the sample database."
2,dont read this book,"backup and restore topics are useless, It will mislead you. It has got lot of typos. Overall its ok book but I dont recommended this one. I bought this after reading amazon reviews but disappointed after going through few chapters."
3,Fun schlock,"""She Demons"" (1958) just might give Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (1956) a run for its money as worst movie of all time--although I think in the final analysis ""Plan 9"" is more fun. ""She Demons"" tells the story of a rich girl and her two male helpers stranded on a supposedly deserted island. The island, however, is inhabited by an evil Nazi scientist who uses nubile young girls for his insidious experiments. SPOILERS: At the precise point that he attempts to ""operate"" on the beautiful rich girl, planes bomb the island and a volcanic explosion destroys the Nazi and his evil lab. (Gee, what timing!) Perhaps the one thing that elevates this film from true Woodian wretchedness is the occasional shock, which, admittedly, probably would have frightened a ten-year-old kid in the Fifties."
5,The Beauties Are The Beasts!!!!,"She-Demons is a great 1950's B-movie filled with monsters and mayhem. The late Irish McCalla(TV's original Sheena, Queen of the Jungle)stars as a spoiled daddy's girl who, along side a group of treasure hunters, gets marooned on an uncharted island in the Pacific, there they uncover a evil plot by Nazi sympathizers to turn beatuiful island women into hideous mutant killers. This film is sure to be enjoyed by b-movie fans and fans of Miss McCalla."
2,Was Expecting More,"Better photos, better writing. If a photo was interesting, the author didn't give much information. In fact she might go on and on about a crime for which there wasn't a photo. If a picture was really interesting, she gave extremely limited info. And I couldn't figure out who or what the 4th picture of the Lizzie Borden axe murder was (author didn't bother to specify - if it was the father's, someone took off his clothes and moved his body onto a different piece of furniture for some reason). All I could gather throughout was that she believes crime is society's fault - not the perpetrator's."
3,Interesting but not what I expected,"The photos are great and the text is interesting, but I wasn't expecting so much history. This is definitely a historical look at crime photos with an occasional contemporary pic."
4,could have been better,For a table book not quite the amout of pictures I would have liked to see. I gave it to my daughter and she loved it...One just never knows...
3,A moving visit home,"Tom and Scott return to Scott's home town for a visit, and when the local sheriff is found dead in their rental car, suspicion turns to Tom. After all, he's the one who corrupted their local hero. Because he himself is suspected, Tom doesn't get to do as much as he usually does, and the book suffers a little. But all the stuff about Scott and his family is very moving.Neil Plakcy, author ofMahu Surfer: A Hawaiian Mystery (An Alyson Mystery)"
5,Stunning live concert from free-jazz master Don Cherry!,"After helping Ornette Coleman give birth to Free Jazz, trumpeter Don Cherry became a pivotal composer/theorist and an invigorating, experimental World Music improviser. This joyful encounter, taken from the Days of Jazz Festival in Stuttgart, Germany, finds Cherry and friends weaving a shimmering, polyphonic musical tapestry that includes his originals and Monk's ""Bemsha Swing."" Features Peter Apfelbaum, Bo Freeman and Joshua Jones.#1348 (57 min, Hi-Fi Stereo)"
5,Extremely excellent,I have enjoyed every moment of it especially how Don presents his artworks. Will always follow his works. Buetifully presented.
2,empties too fast,"Birdscapes 350 Squirrel-Be-Gone I Feeder, 6 lb capacityThe squirrel be gone feature works well but the design of the feeding stations allowed too much seed to fall onto the ground.I watched the sparrows spill half of the feeder in a very short time, now I have to attach a seed catcher to save the seed that falls."
2,doesn't work,This is NOT a squirrel proof bird feeder. We have had it up for about a week and the squirrels have had a feast.
1,bummer,"This feeder drops the seed even when there are no birds on it. Poor design is the problem, not a feeder that I would recommend to anyone."
4,best bird feeder for $,We have had this feeder for about 5 years and the squirrels tried for a while but they can get so little out of it thet they have finally given up and get what they can from spillage. My springs are stretched and am looking for new ones.
3,squirrels are smarter than humans.,Several grey squirrels have figured out how to jump and grab this feeder so that they can get plenty of seed out of it. The red squirrels are not big enough to grab it in the right places.
1,Mistaken ID,"I thought that I was buying reggae C.D. This is obviously not the Don Carlos I was looking for. This is DJ Don Carlos, beware."
5,Smooth Jazz/lounge music for lovers,If you love this genre than this is the disc for you! it is not Reggae!!!!!!!!!There is more than (1) Don Carlos listed...
1,Not OUR Squirrels...,"Perhaps the squirrels in Maryland are more creative and determined, but ever since we hung the feeder last week, we've been inundated with squirrels in our backyard. So far, we've seen one bird using the feeder. The squirrels are able to balance themselves on the bar without it dropping them in order to get to the seed. Twice they have knocked the feeder onto the ground, spilling the contents everywhere. A relative of ours who also has this feeder reports the same problem. The feeder is more secure now and they can't knock it off, but they are still able to readily get to the seed.We've admitted defeat to the squirrels, but at least our cats have a blast chasing them out of the yard!"
1,Very Disappointed in this product.,"I chose to order this particular item because of prior success with the brand. This one has been a huge disappointment. The top will not stay on, and the squirrels seem to actually enjoy climbing down and knocking the top off. Would be very happy to exchange for one that will live up to its name . . . ."
3,SquiresRnot,"I bought this feeder and it does a fair job of keeping squires out. They still get on it but they get little feed. It has descent weather protection for the seed but it swings a lot in the wind. Over all a good feeder for the price. Also, Squires make jambalaya and that reduces the potential for raiders!!!"
3,Birds don't come to it.,I watched birds try to access the seed from all sides and only the smaller birds used it even when the counterweight is set for the heaviest birds. Disappointing.
2,Too funny. Squirrels are really smart,i was sent this as a gift and it worked for about one week. Squirrels simply unscrewed the adjustment screw til it fell on the ground. I put it back on so it unscrewed it again and brought the screw into the woods where it is to this day. Can't find it. No screw and the squirrels are just emptying it to their hearts content. I'll try another one. i miss the birds. My cats miss their little form of TV outside from the screened porch. Too sad.
3,Not totally squirrel proof.,"Like the looks of this feeder but it is not totally squirrel proof and it spins in the wind!!! Have to figure a way to mount it so it won't spin and then will still have to use a baffle to keep the squirrels out. Even though the bottom closes when they put their weight on it, they can still access the seed thru small opening ... I bought two, wish I had only gotten one of them... May return one of them!!! Disappointed!!"
1,"Looks Good, BUT!","This feeder seems well made however if you hang it, it will spin in the wind and the one I received hangs crooked because it is not balanced. It is also heavy and you will need a strong hanger. I intended to mount it on top of a pole attached to the bottom of the feeder. However the bottom of the feeder is attached at an angle to the sides. Therefore if you mount the feeder to the top of a pole it will sit at an angle. I would suggest you keep looking!"
1,Squirrels are *not* gone.,"Squirrel climes up. Tray closes. Squirrels pull the feed out from around the ""closed"" tray. They stay perched up on the tray for 20 minutes at a time as they eat through the feed.This isn't a bird feeder. It's a squirrel feeder, masquerading as a bird feeder."
1,Terrible,"I appreciate what Marvel is trying to do here: take a popular character, return him to his roots, and bring in new readers. Financially, they succeeded. Artistically, they hit bottom.Brian Michael Bendis. Loved by everyone, appartently. Never has a writer so consistently disappointed me as Bendis has. His dialogue is choppy and irritating, his plots are muddled and anticlimactic. And all the revisions he inserted into this story were completely unnecessary.Don't tell me a story in seven issues that you could've told me in two or three. The Spider-Man film did it right, Ultimate Spider-Man did it wrong. The film collapsed all the basic and best elements of Spider-Man into itself, whilst the comic is meandering and annoying.The artwork is sloppy, and makes me feel cheated considering the sleek look of the cover.And turning Uncle Ben into an aged hippie. That's just wrong."
5,This Spider-man rocks!,"I'm not really very knowledgeable about the Spider-man mythos or comic books in general. I do, however, know what I like--and I loved this.The medium might be two-dimensional, but the story is anything but flat. Peter Parker's metamorphosis from high school nerd into wise-cracking webslinger is an emotional as well as physical transformation, and Bendis does a find job relating for the angst and exhilaration.The artwork is vivid, but not garish. Action sequences are full of energy--a few panels seem to literally jump off the page. There is also a wonderful nuance of facial expressions that give the story a real heart.All in all, this is a great introduction to Spidey's updated world."
5,Ultimate spider-man is the best!,"I have read spider-man comics for years and this series is definitley one of the best! the writing, the art, the inking, and the charecters all work perfectley together!This series gets you very involved in the stories, it gets you attached to the charecters with great charecter development through out the issues.I would certainly recommend this series to any comic book fan!"
5,Vittle Vaults work for me,"I recently bought 2 Vittle Vaults, a 30-pounder for cat food from a Petco store to see how it performed then the 40-pounder for dog food from Amazon. I like to check things out before ordering if I can, and glad I did, because I was going to get 2 Vittles stackables to save space, but these two line up perfectly in our narrow laundry/entry whereas the 2 stackables would have stuck out too far.It is much easier to get the last of the kibble out of one of these ""vaults"" than the bottom of a bag, they look better, and keep the food fresher. Amazon transaction quick and easy as usual. What's not to like? And it's fun to spin the lid."
5,might buy a second one,I loved the Vittles Vault storage container... the ants tried to get to the food but failed. Highly recommended for dog food storage.
1,Lid didn't snap on,"This would have been a great container. The spinning portion of the lid works great. However, you are supposed to snap the lid onto the base to create a permanent seal. Both my husband and I could not get it to snap. I also tried calling the company to see if they could send me a replacement lid, but they never returned my call."
3,No more ants!,Alaways seemed to have an issue with ants getting into the dog food. This has worked great! No ants and for some reason I can even leave it on the porch and my normally nosey pooch doesn't try to get in it. Great investment.
2,Plastic shattered after being dropped,We used this container to store our dog food. The lid sealed very well but the plastic of the container wasn't very thick or sturdy. It definitely was not heavy duty. One day it slipped out of my hands while getting my dog's dinner and it fell about three feet to the ground and the whole bottom shattered. I was worried my dog would ingest plastic shards while going for the food everywhere. It was a little bit scary.We emailed customer service and they responded within a few days to say the plastic wasn't covered because we had too much food in the container. It was only about 1/3 full so what's the deal with that?If you purchase this container don't let it ever leave the floor!
4,Holds a 35 lb bag of food easily,"I had to look around for a pet food container I was willing to buy online (I am always a skeptic). I actively did not want a container on wheels - I don't have much space and I thought the wheels would make the container bulky. This container fits in my small space without any problems.With a single dog a 35 lb bag of food is more than enough this container meets all of my needs.From other reviews I gather that it doesn't quite hold the full 40 lb capacity, so avoid this product if you're looking for something to hold more than the 35-37lb range.Another small issue is that when I first started using the container the top could be really hard to open, however I've gradually had less and less trouble the more I use it. Now I really can open it up one handed without any problems.Because it is advertised as 40lb and not 35lb I feel obligated to rate it 4 instead of 5 stars"
3,Couldn't fit 40lb bag of dog food in it,"This is a good product, well made with an airtight seal. The only downfall is that you can't empty a 40lb bag of dog food into it because it won't fit. When it's all said and done, only about 35 lbs will fit, the rest will have to remain in the bag until there's room to empty the rest of it."
5,excellent dog food storage container!!,"This is an excellent product, small enough to place in a corner yet large enough to hold a lot of dog food. I like how there is a separate opening to get out the food that is small enough to get into without the dog being able to get into it. This is a VERY well made product and is far superior to ones you will find in pet stores."
3,Flimsy snap on lid,"The snap on lid arrived cracked so it is not air tight. I did not take it out of the package for a couple of months or I'd have noticed and returned it. I use it to store wheat cat litter which can occasionally harbor little weevils and that is why I had wanted an air tight container, but there is a rubber seal around the inside of the lid which seems to work though the lid doesn't snap on securely. I agree with those who mentioned that the tall shape does not conveniently accommodate a scoop, but it's certainly an improvement over a big, clumsy paper bag."
2,Doesn't hold 40#,"While this is a very nice dog food container, it does not hold 40#, it probably holds <35#. I had a brand new bag of dog food, with just a small size of kibble for a schnauzer, and it did not hold the entire bag. Just to be sure, I checked the label on the side of the container, and it said it will hold 40# of dog food. Maybe it depends upon the size of the kibble, but this product is not as advertised."
4,Works as advertised,"It's a nice container. It's definely air tight. When we received it, it did have a string plastic smell and was a ***** to clean. Also, it seems like it holds 39.5 pounds of food, not 40. :)"
3,Terrible Packaging STICKER AHHH!,"This item is great except for the giant sticker on the container that cannot easily be removed. I spent over 30 minutes with goo-gone trying to get this sticker unstuck from the container. My #1 pet peeve is poor packaging, and this ranks at the top of the list. There are so many adhesive options. Come on people."
1,Sent 2 seperate bases without lids,"Ordered 2 of these thinking I was going to be happy because of all the reviews. got 2 day shipping so I would have proper storage for the food I just bought. Each one of the 2 I ordered came separately in its own package, as JUST THE BASE. No top. Are you serious? How do you have an air tight item without a lid?"
3,Not near the quality of Vittles 30-Pound Vault,"I own this item http://www.amazon.com/Vittles-Vault-30-30-Pound/dp/B0002DJONY/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid;=1290928919&sr;=8-6I decided to get a new one and with the ratings I figured it'd be just as good but $10.00 cheaper. I wish I would have just re ordered the same thing. Once the top is snapped in, it is locked, there is no way of getting it off unless you break it. Mine is not completely sealed. I don't have bug problems as other people have gotten this for that reason. I just like to order 30 pounds and know it'll stay fresh in the vault. This clearly doesn't hold 40 pounds of food. I would say MAYBE 33-35 pounds at the most. The screw on lid is also not good quality. Spend the extra 10.00 to get the better quality vault. I donated mine to a rescue shelter."
5,Works well,I've used this for the past 1 1/2 years and it's worked well. My large lab doesn't even go around it.
3,sturdy but sort of a useless lid,"I got the 40 lb 'vault'. I was hoping that the screw top thing on the lid would help keep dry food fresh for longer, but unfortunately the screw top is sort of useless. You can't get a 1 lb scoop and your hand in through the screw thing so you have to open the actual lid, making the screw thing useless. The 'vault' closes super air tight, which would be great if you could use the screw top, but as you cannot, I just end up setting the lid on top of the 'vault', so the food stays fresh about as long as if I left it in the bag. The 'vault' is quite sturdy, but is easily knocked over by a persistant and large animal because the base is narrower than the top."
4,good but not quite,"produt is very good i'm pleased-----but 40lbs for me is not correct,i couldnt get my 34lb bag of food in---maybe the food is to big???????????"
4,great price,"bought this toy for my son for Christmas. He's 5 yrs old and he enjoys playing it. Paid on $10 for it.BryanDeptford, NJ"
1,Garbage or defective,"You cannot move during the first mission, you can shoot the guys in the middle of the screen and to the right, but cannot shoot on the left side of tv, so the guys there cannot be hit. You are suppose to be able to move around, but it does not work, I don't know why, perhaps defective, I know those controls work in the begining to type your name in. I will probaly return this junk."
2,"Good mechanics, bad cover.","This game works. It works fine. In fact, the game itself is good. However, it would have been better with the same game mechanics but with the guise of a classic arcade-style zombie shooter, like Area 51."
4,paintball gun,"This is a very nice video game for the TV. The gun is huge and very well constructed. My only complaint is that I bought it to use on a big screen TV to have the affect of actually being there. There are a number of TV's this cannot be used on. Other than that a very fine product. This was purchased for a male adult as I don't encourage the use of any guns for children who are really to young to understand the difference in real and play guns. However, this is a very nice product."
2,paintball gun,"After I gave this to my son who is 7, I wish I hadn't. You are actually shooting at people, and I didn't realize this. My 10 yr old said he hear curse words on it, so I put it up. It just depends I suppose on the age of the child and if you mind the cursing. They also said It was too easy to finish all the levels and they were bored with it after a few minutes. Use your own judgement."
5,Edge of your seat reading...,"The first time I began to read the Deadly Sins Scripts I was certain I was going to enjoy them to the fullest. But the Author's twists and imagery, went way beyond my expectations. Each script was more wild than the next.I Began to listen to the Author on the radio so i could hear more of his writing. If you love the Twilight Zone you will eat this book right up. Its Brilliant!I look forward to more of Jack Ward's works."
2,It does not deliver,"A big reason for buying this book was the connection to the supplemental materials in the website. It doesn't work. After contacting the publisher and the author, nothing has happened. Nice idea, poor execution, disappointed customer"
3,ok choice,An ok choice. Not a lot of adjustments for rotary speed. Water flow can be inconsistent between sprinklers. Puddling around sprinkler head.
2,Two losers with careers headed for the toilet.,"With both of their careers going into the dumper, these corporate (...) teamed up to attempt to make a commercially succesful album. The result was pure disaster. Merle has finally come to his senses and has realized he is too old for this (...) anymore. (...)"
2,Cheap chain,"I pruchased this for my daughter for Christmas and while it looks nice and has a nice weight to it, the chain broke in a matter of days. She didn't snag it or pull on it, it just simply fell off her neck as she was eating dinner. Now I have to take it to a jeweler to have a new chain put on it."
3,A classic... for Disco fans.,"I picked this up for a buck at a thrift store the other day for my brother. In the tradition of the rest of the ""Hooked on"" series, we're presented with a collage of medleys with a persistent drumbeat.Also, as with the rest of the collection, it has super high production values and a mild tone only a few steps above most elevator music.This unlikely 1997 album, complete with it's mostly campy cover art is somehow a fitting tribute to the Disco era, and even if it isn't, my brother who's a DJ likes to use it in his techno mixes.I gave it only 3 stars as it causes a strong love-it or hate-it response in people- including myself. If you like the ""Hooked on"" albums and/or Disco, you'll likely enjoy this far more than I did."
1,Don't Buy...,"Do not buy this CD. Instead of each song being played in full, they are combined into five ""mini"" songs, with only about a minute for each part on song (i.e. a minute of Le Freak, and then a minute of In the Navy). It's a band that plays the song, and then goes into another one song. Again, don't buy."
5,Two coil burner,"This product has relatively wide-set coils, an indicator light, and is modestly priced. It is adequate for our needs."
4,One of the best end times Bible studies I've read,Mr. Lindsay does a great job trying to compare scripture with scripture to define the events foretold in Revelation. This book will strengthen your faith. I highly recommend it.
4,Promising,"This is a promising analysis of the Book of Revelation and a welcomed addition to anyone's apocalyptic library. The study of the end times and Revelation is important to anyone, as this book, among others, shows what is to come and the what ifs. In the end, we should be happy that we are going home soon. For those interested in similar titles, I also recommend reading Apocalyptic Secrets of the Hebrew Sanctuary, which analyzes the relationship of the Biblical books of Daniel and Revelation."
1,this guy is nuts,"In the last thirty yeas, this twit has predicted the end of the world about 5 times now. You would assume any rational human with an IQ greater then that of a dog, would start to doubt this fellow, but somehow the real magic is in how many times one can fleece the same flock, and have them still support you."
2,not very good..,"The Lord only used hal once and wonderfully with, 'the late great planet earth' the rest of his outlines are horribly dry."
3,Spock rock,"This was to work as a sampler for me, not versed with the band, but intrigued by at least a few of their songs throughout the years. Sadly I found out all too soon the group is generally misrepresented in their success and much more underwhelmingly hard rock then anticipated, although they offer plenty of intelligent riffing variety to counteract the often found structural boredom and when not embellishing mediocrity or offering unnecessary coverage, blaze through a guitar-streaked stride which finishes a solid final quarter of the show."
5,ET LIVE,"This was the album that should have been filmed. Then we could relive the fun of the 1981-1982 concert tour. I saw them live in Austin, Mn with Aldo Nova in Sept. of 1982 and it was a great concert."
4,Some excellent live performances on the cd,"There are some great live perfomances on this cd the red and black and especially hot rails to hell, and black blade. Vetern of psychic wars is longer here with an excellent guitar solo in it and dominance and submission is done really well. However cities on flame leaves something to be deired as do doctor music, burnin for you, and the roadhouse blues."
4,makes you feel like your there,"Black Blade, Dominance & Submission, are outstanding tracks....I was hoping for a live version of the Vigil, Great Sun Jester, and some tracks from Cultosareus Erectus. However overall it seeems like a combination of ""On your feet"" and the other live album""Some Enchanted Evening"". Eric Bloom's vocals on this album is super, besides his performance on the songs mentioned already-""Vetreans of the Psyhic Wars is brillant, and Buck is still Buck, quite possibly the greatest guitar player of that time frame! This live album has incrediable amount of energy!"
4,A Must For Metal/Rock Fans!,"From one of the true fathers of heavy metal comes this great live recording of their greatest hits. Simply wonderful guitar and arrangements on tracks like the Reaper, Godzilla, Burning For You, and Veteran Of The Psychic Wars. This is the metal that created the metal of today!"
5,The Best live Metal Band Around in the 70's & into the 80's.,Boc has always played live shows with sound that is fawless. They must have the best road crew ever. Thats why they sound so good live. This CD proves it.
2,Give this one a pass,"Unfortunately this author is clearly setting herself up to churn out a lengthy series on this heroine. She is also having trouble blending historical fact and fictional characters. I felt I'd just completed a fact stuffed history lesson. The book had potential but in the end, I was just bored."
1,Yellow brings BEES!,"where is the white ones like these??? wierd. lots of websites on feeders say do not use yellow, its a known thing with people ""in the know"" about feeders. I learned years ago. yet, nobody sells white flowers! HUH??"
4,"Technically flawless, but not emotional","The Julliard String Quartet does a magnificent job of presenting Beethoven's material in a technically perfect performance. To a student, this would be the place to start. Classical music walks a tightrope between precision and passion. The death of classical music will be when it is no longer fun. In this recording the Julliard String Quartet seems to be working, not enjoying, the music.The material is, of course, top notch, the middle-period string quartets being my favorites. This was the point in Beethoven's life when he found his own voice (the ""Eroica"" period it has been called) but before his tragic loss of hearing.The Busch Quartet does a better job of performing the music, but the recordings are at least 50 years old, so the sound quality is somewhat compromised.That said, this recording by the Julliard String Quartet is the best combination of skill, sound, and material."
5,Bought for grandson,"I bought this model for my grandson, and he was thrilled to receive it. I haven't heard any complaints about it. Not even from his dad who has to help him with model cars. The car made me a hit. So I'd have to say it's great."
1,The worst I have seen!!,Do not bother to buy or even rent this one. The girls are not good looking and there is no story. It was a total waste of money!
3,"Isn't horrible, but not good","I give these guys partial credit for trying to please people and for not being at all like all of the crappy music out there today. This CD isn't a bleed to the ears, but it also isn't something I can sit and listen to and love. This band made some good stuff back in the day, but this is just good music made by them in the direction that I didn't want them to go in.Well, this CD actually is not as good as Dream Theater's best at all. They can do a lot better than what you hear on this album. The title track is pretty good, but SLIGHTLY too long."
3,3.5 stars - an improvement,"This is kinda like Falling Into Infinity circa 2005 and shows that Dream Theater can still write a solid song. It's definitely not their best but it's a giant leap up from the sonic mess of metal ideas that was Train of Thought.Some of the songs are mediocre, but the pop songwriting of ""I Walk Beside You,"" the metal and hard rock of ""The Root of All Evil"" and ""Panic Attack,"" and the epic 20 minute title track all make this album deserving of a listen.In addition, drummer Mike Portnoy and vocalist James Labrie have both turned in their most tasteful and, in my opinion, best performances on their respective instruments on this album. Portnoy does not go overboard with his trademark double-bass fills and Labrie sings well within his range, expressing a lot of feeling and singing in a pleasing tone.""Awake"" it ain't, but Octavarium is a pleasant suprise from a band I'd given up on."
2,...Why?,"i have been a dt fan since Six Degrees. the last few albums have been the best dt realeases since awake. however, this one left me wishing i had spent the money on another album. if you new to dt pick up either scenes from a memory or awake, stay away for the worst dt album, octavarium"
3,Octasleeper......,"I'll start by saying I own the complete DT catalog. Big fan for years....Octavarium is not a bad CD, I just have to agree with many of the reviews here-it covers little NEW ground. The songs contain the excellent DT mucianship, however you are hardpressed to remember any one song , even after SEVERAL listens. The last song (epic)-Octavarium is IMHO the best DT track on this CD, but plods along for several minutes before it becomes a decent piece. LeBrie and Rudess are the main ""features"" on this one, and Myung, Portnoy and Petrucci are background ""fixtures""....This effort appears to be DT's swansong, and if so, does not leave the listener with satisfaction."
3,It's just okay.,"DT fans should probably just buy it. DT have always been loyal to their fans in how they've maintained their core sound all these years. I have no problem when they try more commercial things as long as the songs are good. Their effort on this CD was too U2 for me. I like it when they stretch out songs with solos and unison lines as long as they have something to say. Again this album says very little. The reason you should probably get this is because in true DT fashion they've put so much on here that there's bound to be something you really like. However, let me say that if the band ever put out a Greatest Hits album nothing from this album would go on it. Panic Attack is a good tune, but only seems great because it's relative to the other tunes on this CD. It's hard not to compare previous albums, but certain tracks quote past ones. Overall, I'm glad I bought it, but I don't listen to it much anymore."
2,A Quandary,"I have been listening to DT since about '92 when I received an advance copy of Images & Words while working at the college radio station. Anyway, that album blew me away and I've enjoyed most of what they have released ever since.I just cannot get into this album. I'm not sure if it's me or them but I find it impossibly boring. I'm sure many fans are pleased by the return of ""melodic content"" or whatever they found lacking with Train of Thought but...wow. This is like boring old man prog. It makes me itchy to try and sit through it.2 stars because it's DT and I need to leave room for all the talent-free true garbage out there."
2,crOCTAVARIUM?,"With the same excitement I bought all my other Dream Theater albums, I bought this one and too my surprise, it was, well, half unbearable. No more jamming solos, interesting drum patterns etc. but predictable and sometimes corny(I walk beside you and The answer lies within). If I was told 'Never Enough' was the new song by MUSE, i wouldve believed it etc etc, the unpleasant surprises go on and on... 'These Walls' however, is why it got 2 stars and not 1. Brilliant song(If you forget that its Dream Theater playing it. 'Octavarium' is a nice long waste of 24minutes. Suppose it must be soooo hard to follow up on TRAIN OF ThOUGHT. IN SHORT:This is Dream Theater's ST.ANGER. YOU know what I mean... Next."
2,"I'll Listen To It, But I Won't Like It (Much)","Anyone who considers DT at their best on Images and Words, Awake and Train of Thought will not like this album. Sorry, but the inclusion of ""electronica"" is a deal breaker with me. And where the hell are the odd time signatures? Portnoy was definitely taking a breather on this one; he could've played it in his sleep. In fact, maybe that's what he did. (It would explain a lot.) Granted, DT albums take a minimum listen of a couple dozen times to ""get them,"" but this is virtual elevator music in relation to past albums. I'll listen to it but I won't like it (much)."
2,one song is many songs,"You know, these players are all accomplished musicians, however, the music is so ordinary, uncreative, and unispired. Maybe thats the problem with dream theater, they are so adament about showing off their pedantic 'licks' that their really isn't anything beyond them except the ordinary basic song structure. So...these tunes could be any dream theater tunes: no better, no worse i.e. one song is many songs. And the production of this album stinks: where are the keyboards? Jordon Rudess is probably the best thing going in the band but where is he in most of the songs? so deep in the mix and buried behind the 'chunka chunka chunka' of guitar he seems to be almost non existant. And don't even get me started on their banel lame lyrics...ouch!"
2,Waste of Time,"DT is a prog metal band. But i guess many fans focus more on ""prog"" than on ""metal."" Though this album shows some metal sounds, where the hell is proggy sound? No creativity found. For the most of the songs, it's like once-you-hear-the-beginning-part-you-can-predict-the-rest. Like the other songs, Octavarium's 24 mins is completely wasted. They could use only 8 mins (ain't it more relevant to ""Octavarium?"")to express exactly same feelings. I think it's time to turn to different bands like Symphony X."
3,Lynchmob,"I have been a huge Theater fan for 15+ years. I thought they were begining to fade away with 6 degress, but ""Train of Thought"" brought them back up. Now with ""Octavarium"", I feel they are on the down slope again. Seeing them live is unlike many other bands...those of you who have know what I mean. I am happy to say that this summer's GIGANTOUR will have DT, although the light will likely shine brighter on Megadeath unless Theater plays more of the old, less of the new"
3,Hit & Miss,"This album is the weakest of the Jordan Rudess era DT releases. Just kind of blah in spots, maybe the band should have taken a longer break after Train of Thought and the accompanying tour. A bit disappointing. I am hoping that DT will not be a band that just craps out as they get older...."
1,I can't believe how bad this is,"I used to listen the Dream Theater ""back in the day"" so I thought I'd check them out. I can't believe how bad this CD is. Am I glad I didn't pay full price for this. What a boring, pretentious pice of crap.Not recommended."
4,just fantastic music-definitely their best,wow-just wow. I though these guys lost their way but Octavarium is an astounding album. DT fuse absurde levels of technical ability on their instruments with great melodies. The last band that achieved this wasFaith No More (RIP).Just great songs and absurd key and guitar solos. And for the first time DM's singer's voice does not screech (sreiously)Highly recommended-hard rock release of the year??
2,Hmmm--not very interesting.,"Cliche lyrics --- not very deep -- similar melodies to what we have heard on previous albums -- this one seems kind of like ""hey guys we need to make another album and we have no new ideas, so let's just go into the studio and see what happens""."
2,Little Too Depressing,"Thank God for MP3 downloads. I don't think this will be 1 CD I would buy. What's happening with DT is they're pumping too many albums out. So many in that they really don't spend enough time to thoroughly write the songs.Mike Portnoy could of done a lot better in his precussion playing. Just seems like the whole album was based on typical 'Jam Sessions' rather than writing the songs out on paper before playing a note.... The result is a song that simply sounds too generic with little time changes (how can you orchestrate a time change when you jam?)James LaBrie should really stop singing like Radiohead. Since when Radiohead was considered progressive rock? A very depressing sound. For the other songs that aren't so Radiohead like, his vocal singing sounds much more like mainstream radio music.The only decent melody I could get out of the album is Jordan Rudess's keyboard playing (half way into the Octavarium song)."
5,Pretty damn awsome,"Wow, when i first listend to this album, it honestly became one of my favorites. The first two songs ""Root Of All Evil"" and ""Answer Lies Within"" just grab your attention, and as most people know the first song of the album is pretty much the song that tells you if you will hate or love the album. Every song on the new album is just amazing. If you are a fan of Dream Theater I am sure you will love this album, and even if you have never listend to Dream Theater beofre and this is your first Dream Theater cd you will not be disapointed."
5,Incredible,Progressive madness fused with catchy songwriting. I think this is their best album to date.
5,Best CD to date!!!,"This is without a dought their best cd to date. I would recommend this cd over all of Dream Theaters' others. I would say that when you here Drean Theater play, it's like all of the other bands are just standing still, they have mastered their craft!!!James Bunn / Bass player"
2,Seems robotic and lifeless,"Until I looked a bit deeper, I feared I was the only person who thought ""Octavarium"" to be a rather boring amalgam of layered formula. Whatever inspiration spawned this recording, it must have been smothered under the huge, droning wall of sound that envelops the songs.Yes, Dream Theater produced an engineering masterpiece, played flawlessly, and conjured up a slick, scripted package--but the whole effect seems robotic and lifeless. A dose of edginess might have infused some urgency and energy into this session."
3,Good- But DT???,"Im not sure that the 1st few tracks are all that great- when I 1st heard the album I found myself wandering, not even paying attention to the music- after the 2nd song was over, I started to get pulled in. I think that this is a good cd overall but the begining kinda stinks. The 1st song is a lot of 4/4 rythem, and just an average rock song, the 2nd song is slow and somewhat meaningless- but again- the cd picks up- and there are some great songs- must buy for DT fans, but if your new to DT may I suggest Scenes from a Memory-"
2,2 stars,"Not great, not bad. I won't go rating every songs one by one here since I'm quite low on time, but I'll say this : Dream Theater have been a stone rolling down hill since ToT, and this album doesn't really help the situation. The first thing I thought when I heard the first 4 songs was ""commercial"". No interesting, progressive riffs at all, just plain and straight riffs. Even the greatest guitar player ever didn't have much to say on this album : In fact, there are only three solos, and one of them is made exclusively from guitar noises a-la-Kerry King. As a whole, the music composition on this cd isn't really interesting.And don't get me started on the lyrics either.Listen to the last song, but don't expect anything real great.Much Better than Train of thought- but this is still crappy"
5,Un MUST,"Excellant album! Dream theater dévoile un nouveau cté de leur talent en accentuant beaucoup plus sur le vocal et les mélodies. Et non... pas de tounes instrumentale... Cet album est plus commercial que ses prédécesseur le rendu bon dès la première écoute... mais les pièces tel que panic attack, sacrified songs et ocatavarium deviennent de plus en plus magiques à chaque écoute. Pour les fans et pour les newbies, cet album convient à tous."
2,TOTALLY AGREE WITH FRANZ,"Well, there is not much more to say- yes, Pick up Symphony X- they canb do a real epic- Octavarium DOES only have about 7 minutes of real music- WOW- what a great review!! I'd give it about 2 1/2 stars- to 3 stars- but for the dissapointment (esp songs 1 and 2) it gets 2 stars. Oct is not an EPIC song, nor will it ever be."
2,I AGREE,"I really agree with the review below- YES, the Lyrcis. Almost comical- PERT sure knew how to write lyrics- PETRUCCI? Sick to the Guitar buddy- Yeah- I pretty much think they are all out of ideas. They are Getting OUR $$$$$$$$$, thats for sure."
2,a lesson in loyalty,"having been a fan of dream theater since the days of charlie dominici and when they had recently recovered from their majsesty days; this album made me very, very sad. The album is very artistic in what they are trying to do, you can tell the skill is there, but for the most part the musicians sound bored. Utterly bored. I'm sure that there is something else they could have been doing besides making this album,like i don't know... smashing their fingers with a hammer. its not inspiring, there is no real virtuouso performances. There are no ""wow"" moments whatsoever on this album. I bought this album used and i can honestly see why someone decided to unload it. I am still loyal to the band to see what type of redemption album they will put out. But i am a bit leary. It is reminiscent of metallica diversifying their musical choices after the black album, and look at their fan base now."
2,"Poor lyrics, monotonous experience..not like other DT albums","Probably the six d's of inner turbulence was the last album where DT really put some serious effort to be a little distinctive about the riffs, lyrics and ...well, everything else. Octavarium isn't terribly bad after a few listen, but it's nowhere near the other DT albums (except TOT).. When you first listen to the whole album, not a single song seemed never heard before.. DT never was rich in lyrics, but I think they are getting worse everyday..""I walk beside you"" ..a 10 yrs kid can write this in the bathroom in like 5 mins..For some real good Progressive rock, try Porcupine Tree. ""Deadwing"", ""In Absentia"" or any of their earlier albums.. DT is getting boring, if they don't do something in their next album, the end is near."
5,Amazing!,"Ok, I usually don't go this nuts about music. Go and buy Dream Theater's new album Octavarium. It is sublime. I've never heard a band with that much virtuosity. The lyrics have tremendous intellect. If Beethoven had been into rock music, this is the type of music he would have written (not that it's classical, it just has that much talent). As for the song that is the album's namesake (Octavarium): I could never have dreamt in my entire life that rock and roll could be this beautiful."
5,people need to wise up!,"Everyone needs to listen up. Dream theater have been putting out a wide variety of sounds for years.. but enough of everyone trying to say that DT has gone downhill. To claim that this band has left its roots is completely senseless.. Why????? Because DT has always been about new things and because (i hate to burst the bubble of you doubters) DT can simply do whatever they want to do. I guess im not really reviewing the album here, simply defending it. You bums who are trying to say that DT is washed up are simply not getting it. DT is a genre all their own and in that genre they can do whatever they please. I'll purchase whatever they put out, because the musicianship they posess simply cant be found anywhere else. DT has rocked from the beginning, rocks now, and always will rock..... if you disagree.... Petrucci riffs will find you and vaporize you."
3,"Not as PRETENTIOUS, getting better...","OV is getting better... it's not as bad as their previous 5 studio albums! In my opinion this band hasn't been truly good since Kevin Moore left! I can't stand Jordan Rudess. I hate the albums where they overplay just for the sake of it. It's like geez.. WE KNOW you're accomplished musicians but PLEASE focus on writing GOOD material and not just showing off your chops and endless guitar noodling - that pisses me off! This is why bands like Kansas, Saga, Yes, and Rush have always been far better than DT, because those bands consistetly write great lyrics and the music isn't overblown just for the sake of it. When Dream and Day Unite and Images And Words are the only 2 albums that I truly LOVE from this band. I follow what they release but I haven't been happy since."
5,Missing the Point?,"I have read many of the reviews posted here and I agree with alot of it. I haven't been captivated by the last few DT albums the way that Images & Words and Awake did, and of course ""Scenes..."" stands on its own, they have not topped that monster yet. But Octavarium is right up there, it's an amazing journey through every corner of the prog rock universe. However, some of you seem to be missing the point on one particular track. ""Sacrificed Sons"" is NOT a slam on the Bush administration, at least I fail to see how it could be. It is also not merely about ""war"". That's far too general a term. Read the lyrics. 9/11. The shock, grief, anger, and horror of that day is spelled out in the words and soaring melody, especially in the chorus. ""Who would wish this on our people..."" It strips away all the political hoohah and leaves us asking the most important question. Why?"
5,Dream theater cd one of my best buys,In this cd Dream theater show us how to play at the same time with inteligence and feeling obtainig a great mix of music..
3,8 is not enough!,"8 songs but only 4 good ones. DT needs to return to ""Scenes"" and build of that amazing album. Best track Walk beside You. Buy any Enchant album over this. If you haven't heard Enchant check their website theoasis.cc"
5,Still amazing,At 47 I have seen and listen to a lot of great bands in both prog and métal . When I heard them for the first time back in 1992 I was impessed . When scene's 2 came out I was amazed and now I can safely say that dream theater is WOW (AKA world of wonder)simply unmatched
1,Being a Dream Theater fan since 1992....,"I feel I deserve my $11.88 back. The soundtrack to a toilet flushing (actually, that would sound better.) Maybe their next release.I think a little more downtime should be spent before the next release. Major disappointment, guys."
4,"Their Overall Best Sound, Their Overall Dullest Performance","Dream Theater's Octavarium is an interesting album because it sounds so much different than everything else they have recorded. No one band member shines as much on this cd, with the exception of Rudess. Drums are very good but not amazing, guitar is always there but Petrucci doesnt have that standout solo. Myung has his spots too, like the beginning of Panic Attack. Best songs are probably Panic Attack and the epic 23 minute title track Octavarium. The title track sounds like a Dream Theater epic with a very prominent Yes influence--a little of the old, and the new Yes. There are also some references to other bands' songs, like Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, and Yes's Machine Messiah.It's definitely worth listening to, but not before Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory or Train of Thought. Those are their best."
2,Damn...,"Honestly, I'd take train of thought over this. Where are the solos? Where are the sweet riffs? Never Enough and Panic Attack sound exactly the same. The first four tracks are just plain awful. What the hell is up with Root Of All Evil? Why is there so much James Labrie all the time?So far, I'd count this as the biggest dissapointment of 2005. But hardly anyone agrees...."
3,Journey to the downside,"I am a hardcore DT fan but I am afraid I can't swallow this latest opus- as many have stated where is the creativity? where are the magical moments when you either cry, get goosebumps or are in awe of their technical prowness? (see IAW, Awake, SFAM or even SDOIT)Well, it took me a while to accept Train of Thought, but at least they were commited- they had tried, wandered another path- not to all fans satisfaction- but they did it with gusto.Now, what do we have? A bad catalogue of their possibilities- a caricature of themselves- (check that U2 esque song..)and worse the whole album is hollow.(besides,the ""tribute to Floyd"" on Octavarium is terrible apart for the latest part of the song which reminds us that on other albums, DT ruled.A french listener said: RIP DT- well, if they do not wake up soon, and stop selling out (that's what this album is), the band should better split instead of having us fooled and dissapointed."
1,The blank CD has finally arrived.,I can't believe people are actually wasting money on this dreck.Why does this band still exist?
1,Mistaken Identity................,"Let me first say, how can you review cd that isnt out yet (this refers to people that reviewed this cd before today). Second, if you got this cd off a P2P program such as; Ares, Kazaa, Lime Wire or whatever then you have the wrong cd. I did this myself. I downloaded the whole cd of what I thought was Dream Theater's newest album entitled ""Octavarium"" and after a little bit of research I come to find out that it was James LaBrie's solo cd entitled ""Elements of Persuasion"". Yeah, now im a little pissed. So if you think you have ""Octavarium"" then go ahead and think that but if I were you I would look up ""Elements of Persuasion"" and preview the songs to make sure......"
4,Pretty good for a new DT album,"While not my favorite DT album (Their older stuff, such as Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence and Change Of Seasons were far superior), Octavarium is still a good progressive rock album. It is probably their most mainstream album with hits such as ""These Walls"" and ""The Root Of All Evil"". The best song off this is ""Octavarium"" (the title track, the last song. James' vocals sound awesome on that song. So if you want the newest from DT, buy this."
4,"GREAT work, one of their best","Dream Theater is sometimes a frustrating band. Each player is a near-virtuoso, and the group is ambitious and daring with each project. That said, I found their last two efforts, ""Six Degrees"" and ""Train of Thought,"" were lacking both in memorable melodies and texture. ""Octavarium,"" on the other hand, has it all. There are faster and slower songs, great melodies, AND the prog-like flash that DT fans expect. I'm particularly impressed with John Petrucci's playing on this record. I'll admit that his work sometimes doesn't involve me emotionally, but this album is an exception to that rule. His playing shows variety, taste, and both restraint and reckless abandon - where each is necessary. The icing on the cake is that the ending epic title track, all 24 minutes, is a superb musical journey that really sustains interest over the entire length of the track. It's probably my favorite extended-length DT song and is a remarkable achievement."
3,Just Okay...,"Too many side projects and not enough focus on DT...this album has some cool moments, without question. But overall, it's inconsistent. James Labrie's has some great vocal moments and Mike Portnoy continues to wow, Petrucci's solos, normally the highlight are lacking creativity and Ruddess's keyboards are too techno and too chintzy. I'm enjoying this album, but I loved, LOVED LOVED, nearly everything else they've put out. Just doesn't compare to the rest."
3,took another listen,"I was reading the negative reviews on this album and thought that this must be the worst album ever. So I went back and listened to it in its entirety. This album isn't bad. I enjoyed it, actually. I really don't thnk they were slacking on this. It's not I&W, but it's not as horrible as these reviewers would have you believe. I guess that's why I read these reviews for amusement and would never base my buying decision on them. No problem with this piece. If you want to hear the worst album ever, then may I suggest anything from Metallica since the black album."
2,"Still Dream Theater, but a bit more boring","I've listened to this album about 15 times, but I find very little exciting material here.It is certainly more diverse than Train of Thought, which I think is a good thing. But for the rest, most of the songs just sound like typical Dream Theater, only less inspired, less enthusiastic and simpler than on their previous albums.I know Dream Theater can do much better than this. It sounds like they need to refind their inspiration and energy.Compared to their other albums, this album is definitely the most boring."
3,still seaching for scenes pt 2,"The reason people have scenes from a memory so rated high, is that you see all of the full talent. they are all the masters of what they do but the last few cds they are not showing that. I saw Pertrucci on the g3 tour with joe and steve, and he is just as good as them but you cannot tell on these last few outings, this one is heavier than the last one and John is doing heavy chords, but if I wanted to hear a heavy rythem guitar Ill go for jon schaffer of Iced earth. John is classicaly trained but we do not see it here, and keyboardest master jordan ruddess does little to impress, Of the last cds since ""scenes"" the one band member who hs not dissapointed is john myung. I would say avoid this get and evening with petrucci and ruddess and of course, ""scenes from a memory"""
2,Disappointing to say the least.,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of DT's new album Octavarium but after listening to it intensely it has left me thoroughly disappointed, this to me is a run of the mill release with very little substance and it doesn't leave you with a feeling of wanting more, all I can say is get Kevin Moore back and give us that sound the band once had with Image and Words, Awake, and the legendary A Change of Seasons"
3,I agree with Gatlenberg--almost,His review is darn near perfect- But- Sacrificed sons is a 4/5- The 1st two songs are hidious (1st track- boring 4/4 rock-2nd track- cliche- cornball lyrics)- The rest of the album is good- 3 stars fits perfectly!!!
2,Even great bands occasionally release bad recordings,"Even great bands occasionally release bad recordings. DT has done so before (Falling Into Infinity, When Day and Dream Unite) and has done so again with this lackluster release. I have no problem with DT trying to write shorter songs and expand their horizons. They are just being incredibly inconsistent in their output. I said this when I reviewed TOT but DT really needs an outside producer to fulfill their potential. DT has never been an original band. They are quite obvious in showing their influences [Megadeth (esp TOT), Rush (esp I&W;), Yes, Radiohead, Peter Gabriel-era Genesis (SOAM)] and this record is no exception.The problem is that the influences in this record includes (gulp!) Coldplay and (okay, these guys rock!) Muse. This one is for fanboys(girls) only."
4,Octavarium is a most worthy follow up to Train of Thought,"At first listen I wasn't sold but then I let it sink in that this wasn't 'Train of Thought'. I then realized just how good a record this really is. I saw Dream Theater live on this tour and was completely blown away. Their level of musicianship is just not matched these days. They carry the flame of arena progessive rock into the future with no contemporaries. Octavarium's sound engineering is noticably different from Train of Thought as well. While that was a more in your face mix and agressive sounding, this one is more atmospheric and ambient. There is a slight haze throughout the CD. I guess it's more dream like...ha ha.."
3,"Great album, defective CD","I'll start off by saying this is a wonderful work, especially the last, title track. Unfortunately, the CD is defective. Playing the final track produces annoying stuttering close to the end of the work. Ripping it into iTunes did so, too. Well, one computer wouldn't get past the stutter points and the other finished the ripping, but left clicks in the place of the stuttering. The disc is physically fine. I can see no flaws in the plastic or the substrate.Get the album, just beware that some of the CDs are defective, but not in a way that you can tell until you play them."
2,Uninteresting compared to previous efforts,"I liked Awake... Images & Words... Scenes From a Memory... Six Degrees... Train of Thought was okay... but then we get to Octavarium. I listened to it once and found it in general to be supremely boring. One of my friends always comments that he doesn't like Dream Theater because while they can play like madmen, they don't really have any soul; usually, I disagree with that, but Octavarium strikes me as formulaic and just ""we threw something together so people would buy it."""
1,Didnt Powerman 5000 make this song?,"I think that propellerheads took credit for what powerman 5k did. Just thats what i heard, beause powerman 5k are way better thank propellerheads."
1,Arabian gulf does not exist,the correct name is PERSIAN GULF. UNITED NATIONS says so in resolutions ratified in 1971 and 1983. dirty arab dollars cannot change history
1,Potential Unfullfilled,"Unfortunately, this book is, almost exclusively, one of the worst attempts at analytic architecture that I have ever read. It oversimplifies and underestimates the depth of sensitivity with which architects are using emerging computer technologies to explore new domains of design philosophy. Having quite a familiarity of the the firms that the author hurriedly squimmed over in his text, I found no new insights or comprehensive frameworks with which to view the current architectural landscape. If you are looking for attractive, computer renderings, then by all means purchase this book. But if you are searching to refine your understanding of the current architectural culture, find a different author."
1,Already extinct,"I read this book when it first came out, and my initial reaction was that it was an overhyped piece of trash. Nowhere in the book is there one piece of relevant information, with regard to the world of architecture (or anything else, for that matter). I decided to give it some time and try rereading it, to understand what my colleagues saw in it. I still can't figure it out. This book was extinct the moment it hit the public realm. I'd suggest spending your time (and money) elsewhere."
1,bottom book on the coffee table,"The images are very dated, and one has to wonder how anyone would consider it a good read. Perhaps, the reviewer(s) that rate it well could very well be the author himself trying to up his sells cause its bad."
1,All special features are text screens,"I purchased this set hoping for a taste of theThe Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collectionsets which cost more but appear to include so many neat features. Boy was I disappointed. The cover blurb led me to believe there were some special features on this little set too, but what they have stinks. There are a few paragraphs of text on screens you have to tediously page through, that's it. No audio commentary, no little video profile of Rod Serling, no nothing. I even found the menu scheme annoying. I was constantly making the wrong selection even though there are only THREE options! That's how badly they named the options.So if you just want a DVD of a few semi-random (certainly not the best) TZ episodes, go ahead and shell out your $20. Just be aware that that's all there is."
1,Volumes smooshed together,"This Twilight Zone fan Favorite is just Vol.1,2,3,4,5, Smooshed up in one DVD!!!Not worth my money unless you don't have any Twilight zones, then you might want this... I have all the Twilight Zones on the Volume sets! each one by one, I thinks it's more better!!!"
3,"TZ 40th Anniversary, Deja Vu","It's both amazing and disappointing that this 2010 release is identical toThe Twilight Zone: 40th Anniversary Gift Packfrom roughly 10 years ago, with the exception of the special features. Of the 19 episodes, less than half are truly classic. If you check out the reviews of the 40th anniversary set, you'll see how many fan favorites are missing. Personally, I would have voted for these additions:* To Serve Man* Midnight Sun* The Eye of the Beholder* The Hitchhiker* The Living Doll* It's a Good LifeHard to believe that in the past 10 years they couldn't put together a better collection."
2,Full Seasons...,"I get the idea of a cash grab Image, especially in regards to one of, if notthe most imaginative and inspiring television series of all time.But why is ""Probe 7 - Over and Out"" included?...just a terrible episode.If anything the episode ""Two"" (Elizabeth Montgomery/Charles Bronson)tells a very similar story, told it first (2nd Season), and tells it much better.Hope there are some extras here otherwise just no point in another dip.If you have yet to bring any Twilight Zone's home, go for the FULL seasons instead.You won't be disappointed."
5,One to read over and over,"The crooked shape of this book gives a clue to what lies within. The Slant Book tells the tale of a boy whose stroller goes careening down a long hill, and the trouble he causes on the way down. The illustrations are great fun, and fill in the gaps where the words get difficult for small children. We've read The Slant Book over and over and never get tired of it. This book is a real pleaser for kids from 3 to 8"
5,I liked it,I liked this DVD. I like National Geographic and believe they do investigate their material...I was looking at all that I could find on the 911 tragedy...this was just one of the DVD's..
2,Very Poor Presentation,"This could have been a very good documentary, but the video editing style made it unwatchable for me. The camera never stays on any subject for more than 5 seconds, film is sped up and slowed down for no apparent reason, and bright flashes of light with loud sound effects highlight the transition from scene to scene. The events surrounding 9/11 are fully capable of engaging my attention without this in-your-face style of presentation, which ironically dilutes the overall impact of the film."
2,National Geographic - Inside 9/11 (Commemorative Edition),"The information that was presented was all right, but I disliked the way it was presented to the audience. It by all means paid no respect to the victims of that tragic act performed by evil cowards. Pictures flicker and over-smart jingles and annoying noises far too often distort the message and irritate the viewer. It somehow appears as if it was a show designed by a bunch of hyper-active kids in the early teenage years!I am sorry I had to ""let some steam out"" in this review, but I felt that I had to do so because the ""show"" in reality was put together by a company - National Geographic - which I believed was serious and of great responsibility.Best Regards,Mogens"
3,"good documentary, but not fully accurate","as i did like the documentary myself, there were many parts that i kind of scratched my head. for example, one of the main people behind the constructing of the wtc's, Frank Demartini, was in the north tower helping others, and kept claiming that the towers are going to collapse, and the situation is very serious, and so on. however, he had mentioned in a seperate interview, prior to 9/11, that any fully loaded 707 that would crash into the towers could be withstanded, even multiple planes, and that a plane crashing into the towers was like poking a hole through the netting of a screen door, it only punctures it and doesnt affect it whatsoever. so clearly, someones story telling on National Geographic was inaccurate when they made this movie. as far as the rest of the movie, i have seen it 2 or 3 times, and i cant think of any inaccuracies off of the top of my head, but if i saw it again, i could probably point out more things."
4,Outstanding dvd,I had this dvd for some time now. Then a week after 5/1/2011 the date The U.S. found a killed 9/11 Mastermind Osama Bin Laden the National geographic channel aired this very program. After the momentus killing of this mass murderer i wanted to see the entire program again to refresh the history leading up to the dreadful day in us/world history. The year by year and step by step story behind 9/11 is very detailed. I am a history buff so i enjoyed/endured the it.
1,A disappointment from a class act like NG,"I was so disappointed that this DVD avoided serious questions about the 9-11 `investigation'. If the right questions are not asked and debated, then the truth will never be known. The many scientists around the globe that have legitimate beefs about the official story should have had the opportunity to be heard. Why was Building 7 never even dealt with? This video was very one sided, with great production value as you'd expect from NG, but basically nothing more than propaganda. It saddened me."
1,Made for COINCIDENCE theorists. No truth here.,"I have never seen a WORSE production by National Geographic than this. I have lost respect for them after this awful DVD. They did not do their homework, nor did they connect the dots.Very disappointing. Watch ""9/11 - In Plane Sight"" instead."
3,I can't even look at the cover it's so sad,"Today,Tommarrow and in the Future we will always remember today. When planes got hijacked and when the buildings fell and when millions of lives were lost. Ten years and counting we will always remember September 11 2001."
3,Less info than expected,The content was less than I expected after seeing the initial recap by National Geographic on TV.
4,Good example of feminist philosophy of science,"A feminist critique of the mainstream themes in the philosophy of science. Argues for a 'stand-point' approach, which entails the explicit incorporation of value-judgements into science and giving greater weight to the 'subjects' of study in social science. It is argued that by taking the stand-point of the subjective and lived-experiences of the oppressed into one's theories and practices, one's understanding of social phenomena can be both more 'objective' (in a special sense) and potentially empancipatory."
2,this book bites,"Sandra Harding is so repetative and redundant, it was extremely difficult to concretly understand her point. Her argument that feminist theories challenge androcentric approach of western philosophy and scientific thought was lost in her writing style and syntax."
4,Great product. Arrived quickly.,I've been feeding Enzymes Pro + to my 2 year old rottweiler for just over a year now. He has some allergies so we are making his food and give him the Enzymes Pro+ every day. His allergies seem to be better. He has a beautiful coat. The 4 pound bucket was just what I needed.
4,I dig it.,"I admit I initially thought this was a new album, but then I saw the tracklist and realized it was a collection of sorts. So what we get here is a couple remixes, a couple b-sides, and the ""better"" tracks from their two albums. A few more tracks would have been nice, and I'd easily swap ""Nickel Bags"" for ""It's Good To Be Here"". Overall though I like what's included. Obviously a new album would have been more welcome, but at least we get something from them, and they are on tour as well."
1,Nuttin but a remix /greatest hitz album,"I always liked digable's back in the day, they were doing their thing, not trying to be fake gangsta's or playa's. babygirl also was nice with hers not to mention easy on the eyes. I thought this was some new release but it is actually a fake greatest hits collection with some old remixes which we all have heard before. dont waste your money on this download it for free:)"
3,Bon Jovi - New Jersey: The Videos VCD,"The video's here are taken from the band's 1988 album of the same name, which are all pretty good, if not all very similar. (Partricularly Bad Medicine, Lay Your Hands On Me, Blood On Blood) The interviews in between the videos are also funny with the band (mainly Richie and Dave) joking around!The main downside is the fact that because it's a Video CD, the video quality is not brilliant, compared with the VHS version which has superb quality, but nonetheless, this is the only official digital format of this release which should really be for die hard fans only. Also the VCD version contains subtitles which cannot be turned off as they are inprinted onto the video, but other than that, this is a fine release from the Jersey boys!"
4,Very Good,"The HP Pavillion is a very good computer. It is moderately fast, has a good sized hard drive and plenty of RAM. Also it has a lot of USB ports (7) and two firewire ports. Why four stars and not five? The first one I had blew after 2-3 weeks but the new one has been fine for 3 months."
4,Elegant Illustrations & technical Insights,"These artists demonstrate a wide variety of techniques through an array of styles that inspires me to create... the book is over 5 years old, and so these artists were working in early editions of Photoshop, on Pentium III machines or old mac hardware... and the results are amazing. With Moore's Law acting as the wind in our sails, users in current versions of Photoshop should be able to meet or exceed this level of excellence if they apply themselves! Beautiful illustrations and concise explanations make this a book that will inform and inspire readers."
2,"Ok, but there are better books.","This book has some interesting examples of illustration using Photoshop, however it is a little out of date (CS2 and before). I would probably not buy it if I had it to do over again."
2,Disappointing,The book was far more of a sales brochure for Nautilus equipment than I had expected. Perhaps even more disappointing was the mediocre quality of the instructions in Part II. I found the instructions no more detailed than those affixed to the sides of Nautilus machines at the gym.
4,"Good reference, but a little one sided","I am new to Nautilus equipment and this book has been a big help. It explains how to use all of the machines and provides sample workouts. My only complaint about the book is that it gives the impression that Nautilus training is the only valid form of strength training. Many pages are devoted to explaining why other forms of exercise are not as good as Nautilus. This makes the book feel like one big commercial for Nautilus. If you are just starting an exercise program (like myself), this book is helpful, but read some other books to get less biased perspective."
2,ehh,More of a documentary then a well put together show. I read the article online and it was quicker and more informative then the dvd was.
5,I LOVE THESE !!!!!!,"I am in love with these markers ,wonderful colors ,very vibrant,and shading with these markers is a breeze .I highly recommend them ,and it's a great price ,they also last . you will not regret buying these the only bad part is when i ordered them they were more expensive now they are cheaper .DARN!!but overall a great marker ,shipping was really fast too ."
1,Bare Escentuals,Do not like the coverage and or the smoothness of the product. I have heard some positive things about this product for quite some time and felt I should try it. I am very dissappointed.
1,"Soft-core porn, NOT massage","I feel strongly that massage and erotic massage can be a wonderful, meaningful sharing for lovers. BUT this DVD is nothing more than soft-core porn (fine if that is what you want to view). To imply this DVD is instructional is highly misleading. As a certified masseur and writer on massage, I highly resent Penthouse's scam on this presentation."
1,I threw it out,"As the previous reviewer stated, this tape is bad.Its actually awful and the title is greatly misleading.It deserves 0 stars instead of 1."
4,HP c4100 Black ink cartridge,When I first inserted the cartridge my printer responded with an error message telling me that It could not tell me my ink levels because it does not accept grayscale ink cartridges but it did print and has been printing fine since.
1,HP Dud,"This product arrived as promised, however it would not load in printer. Tried several things to remedy. Printer troubleshooter kept saying ""no cartridge in printer"". I finally went to Staples & bought new cartridge. Not good. DUD!"
1,NOTHING IN PACKAGE WASTE OF 22.00,"JUST GO THE PACKAGE, THERE WAS NO CARTRIDGE IN PACKAGE. NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN NO INK NO PRINTER WORK"
2,Will the water lilies survive?,"I received the package of two water lilies - both are very small. One of them (the pink one) had no leaves and only half an inch of stalk left. I'm curious if these will survive, and if they do survive how long they'll take to grow. Disappointing."
2,no blooms yet,"plants in water almost a month and only one of two has a leaf above water level.. no indication that blooms are going to happen. disappointed in this purchase. yes, i fertilized them when i planted them."
5,DITTO!!!!,"I couldn't say it better than these folks have said it. Yes, his most erotic to date. A virtual carnival awaits you, as you walk down the boardwalk of the 'fantastical' mind of Hajime Sorayama. Must have for those wishing to shock. -Kevin"
5,Great for variety of uses!,"I purchased one of these stamp kits for doing payroll. I use it to stamp messages onto time cards as I process them for payroll (Holiday pay, days not scheduled, etc.).We have found many other uses for it in our office as we can change the message quickly.Users should take their time when removing the letters from the letter tray, though. I've lost a few because some letters required a bit of pulling to get them off. When they released, it was so quick and unexpected that they fell out of the tweezers.When the letters get too inked up, I use rubbing alcohol and q-tips to clean the excess ink off."
3,Versatile. but has small text,"I bought this item as it is very useful around the home/office, however I wish the text character stamps were larger. I had no problems with StampXpress, the distributor of this item but with the item itself. I just wish the (Austrian) manufacturer would come out with an optional large-text (9/16-3/8"")character accessory pack."
1,Horrble quality,The lid on this will never stay down and the slightest about of sway causes it to come loose. squirrels have literally been able to open it and reach in and throw the food out! Do not buy..I will be retunring this....
5,Birds Luv It!,"Actually this is the second one of this product that I have purchased, not because there was somethiing wrong with the first one, but the birds luv this feeder. I actually have to fill it daily. I'm fortunate to have flocks of birds at my feeders..Gold finch, Purple finch, Pine siskin, chickadees, etc. This feeder is very durable and the squirrels appear to not be interested in it. I highly recommend it!"
2,Disappointing,"This series of ""weird"" films is very hit and miss and this is unfortunately the latter. I can't even remember what it's about but I can advise against buying it.Probably not the best review you've read but if I had read this I would have saved myself a few dollars and that's good enough for me."
2,Unusual,"Funny, kinky and not particularly well made, this film is for anyone who likes unusual films and possesses a strong stomach."
3,What about Enzo Dara?,"I'm a big fan of the Rossinian Bass Enzo Dara, who seems to be neglected in reviews of works he does in favor of the ""big names"" who are on the recordings. There is a reason he records with these big names. He is a great a interpretor of Rossini and similar composers of the Bel Canto style, who i always enjoy, and certainly THE Doctor Bartolo in Rossini's Barber of Seville. I saw a tape of Dara doing his Bartolo at the Met in the 80's opposite Nucci. Something i really appreciate about Dara's approach is that he is so physically humorous, and doesn't need to rely on vocal tricks and schtick with his voice, which makes for much more entertaining performance for me. For me he makes the recording, along with the always lovely to listen to Marilyn Horne. Nucci isn't in his best voice, and i don't know who the tenor is, but oy. Anyway, that's what i think."
3,Bee Guard 4pack,The product came in very quickly. They look just right. They didn't fit snug on my feeder and the birds just knocked them off. I think stating the inside diameter would be a big help so I could make sure they would fit right since I don't know the brand name of the feeders I have.
2,It's probably not the fault of the bee guard,I had the hummingbird feeders with the screw on bottles and they started leaking (from the heat?) everywhere and were covered with bees. I bought these to keep the bees away but the feeders were leaking from the seams also so it made little difference. The real cure is to buy the saucer type feeders. I am replacing all my feeders with saucer types. They did keep the bees out of a feeding port with a lost guard. I had repeatedly put a 2 inch screw in the port but the bees were working the screw out!
1,Bee Guards,I was disappointed because these size bee guards don't fit any of my hummingbird feeders. I didn't know they came in sizes. I kept them anyway...hopefully for future use.
2,Perky Pet 205Y 4 Count Bee Guards,Would have loved to see how this product worked but it did not fit any of my hummingbird feeders. I went to the hardware store to purchase new ones. Didn't fit any of those either. Am very disappointed that it didn't tell you what feeders to use--would have ordered them as well. Was NOT obvious what so ever!
4,Bees Be Gone but not quite,"Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however, there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees. Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay. Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar. Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise. When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well."
4,Perky Pet Bee Guards,"The bee guards do work on the Perky Pet pinch-waist glass hummingbird feeder (203CP), but there is one hiccup the fit around the stem of the feeder flower could be a tighter fit as they have a tenancy to slip off easy when the bottom stem flower base is put back together after cleaning or when the feeder may be tipped to far to one side. That is why I gave it a 4 out 5 stars rating, hope this review helps..."
2,JP,Bought these bee guards to keep the bees out of the glass tube feeders we puchased at the same time. They don't fit the glass tubes of the feeders.
2,DID NOT FIT MY PERKY PET FEEDER,"Even though I owned a perky pet feeder, these bee guards did not fit properly and fell off. Cannot recommend."
1,Bee Guard,"The Perky Pet Bee Guard 4pack does not keep the bees, wasps, hornets or any other flying insect from lighting on the feeder and sucking necter from around the feeding posts. To guard the actual opening is of no advantage."
4,This is our Common Human Experience,"A very amusing and easy read, Broder's ""Great Indoors"" is simply a must have of anyone who has followed the man's weekly column in the Cleveland Free Times (or the old Cleveland Edition). It's a veritable autobiography of an indoor intellectual in serial form, and myriad points of cosmic import are established. You'll read, and will doubtlessly recognize yourself somewhere in Broder's tales of tribulation and triumph set here in the wondrous urban armpit of our Great Nation, Cleveland. The best part is that these columns are presented chronologically, and in bite-size readings. So you can put it down whenever you like. Read a couple bits on the bus. Peruse a few more nuggets while making your evening toilet. You'll come to realize that you aren't the only one who does silly and stupid things when left alone in the confines of one's domicile. This stuff is funny, and the author is to be lauded profusely."
1,Do not buy this book,"This is a very defective OCR scan of the 1903 English translation of the Convivio. It has not been edited and is full of misprints, particularly in the Italian and Latin. It is, to put in bluntly a disgrace."
5,EXCELLENT!,"I read this book and saw so much of myself. As a newly diagnosed young woman, it is a comfort to know that there really are people out there struggling day in and day out with this disease! Thank you Carole for your wonderful insight!"
5,An amazingly honest account of life with MS.,"Carole's story is breathtakingly honest. She is a real inspiration, I found I could not put the book down. I feel I have a much greater understanding of what it is like to live with a dibilitating disease such as MS the various difficulties faced not only by the sufferer but their family and friends. An extremely heartfelt and compassionate story, I was cheerng for Carole and wish her every success in her life."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a big disappointment. She just isn't a very good writer, or particularly introspective or surprising. What she IS is very concerned with herself -- she dramatizes her situation out of proportion, and is able to gather a whole team around her to support her (very mild) symptoms.Everyone she comes in contact with is immediately recruited to help take care of her! As a woman who has struggled with MS for over 15 years I have to admit I found little to instruct, comfort or inspire me in this very self-centered account."
2,"Sorry, but not that great.","I read this book in a couple of hours ~ that is how fast I breezed through it and became more annoyed as the chapters went on. I could relate to some of what Carole Mackie was talking about, but a lot of the focus was how she handled (and not very well I might add)dealing with her boyfriend and not so much about MS. I was very excited to get this book, but was let down."
1,Waste of Time,"The only reason I finished this book was because I kept HOPING something of interest would happen, it never did.Yes, I have MS, just like Carole. I can relate to some of what she has lived, but her symptoms are SO VERY VERY MILD it irrates me that she gets to feeling so sorry for herself!Give me a BREAK! A job that bends over backwards to accomodate us, we don't ALL get THAT lucky! Her convienent connections to celebrity folks so that she can through fabulous benefits! Not only are her parents civially, friendly divorced, BUT both sets of stepfamilies get along like the Brady Bunch. Tons of female helpers always moving in, doing for, caring for.. someone who was basically ""TIRED"" no big long lasting problems! The boyfriend leaving was predictable and blah. Now she has a BOOK to help pay her bills, AHHH that ALL we with MS should have such luck and connections!"
1,"Disappointed, not worth the money","Light bulb did not work it was burned, generator experiment did not work, and other issues. We were not able to make the experiments work not knowing the defected issues in the kit.And the lost of interest after anticipation form our kid, we realized that we wasted the money on a very poor kit."
1,Didn't work for me,"Purchased this as a gift and couldn't even get the first project to work. Thus, it's a waste of money for me. Like several other reviews say, the instructions are lacking. And it's a joke that the instructions refer you to their website. You would think they would have tips and how to videos to help you but they don't. Funny thing is that they probably could sell more products if they took the time to help you use the products correctly."
1,Do Not Buy!,"The product doesn't work well. Though the instructions were clear, the actual ending product didn't work at all. I was disappointed at the product. I tried all the ""inventions"", but most didn't come out right. I don't recommend buying this product. It's a waste of money."
3,Inventions kit,"Fun when it first arrived, but my 9 year old's interest did not last. That may be our fault though--we need to do this with her to up her interest level. We're going to work on it some more this summer so that she can try all the ""inventions."""
2,Not worth the money,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my son. The box looks like it came from the party store. There is a pinwheel in it, and some wire. We tried the first experiment, making a coil with the wire, and it failed. The other experiments looked equally lame, so I gave up."
1,Instructions confusing.,Instruction booklet was too short and cryptic and confusing. I could not build any of what was listed in the booklet.
3,Inventions kit,"I thought it was a great little gift, has a lot of things to do, but not if your child isn't big on wires and such. Looks like it comes with more than it does. But it is a great introduction to the way things work."
3,Almost good,"Purchased for child early but waited until 9, almost 10 years old. Very interested in Science and electricity. As others have noted the directions leave a lot to be fixed. We have done the Motor - way cool, I think my son actually does understand how it works. I did the work to put it together. I do not think he could have succeeded. Tried the flashing light ... really? Did you guys ever test it? If so did you use the string you sent in the package? Extremely disappointing. Do not expect to get the parts back in the package. Also making the foam block a little bit bigger, heck make it twice as big (I expect it would cost 2 cents more to make) would have been helpful.I am very hopeful for the radio, as I think it would be sweet. But I fear the chance for success to be low. The telegraph I expect to work as how hard can it be ..."
2,Why Did I Finish This?,"This book was so badly written and disorganized, the characters were so poorly developed....I do not know why I finished it.What little was revealed about these mostly spoiled and unlikeable characters made me want to give most of them a swift kick. The situations were farfetched and unrealistic --almost laughable. The plot, if one can call it that, jumped all over the place and never returned to where it left off. Contrivances and coincidences abounded. It was so obvious how it would end.This book sorely needed some strong editorial input to get it re-organized and clean it up.I had looked forward to this book since I really liked one of this author's other books, ""Grace and Favor"". It is a shame Ms. Upcher did not take more care with ""Down by the Water""."
3,"Ok book, but I cared more about the nanny than Hope","The book was an ok, average book. I thought that Hope was very spoiled and she annoyed me. I just couldn't really get into caring about her. The nanny was a more interesting character. It was strange how they ended really quickly by summing everything up and solving all the issues-it was a little too fast.I don't think I'll look for other books by this author. Maybe if Hope had had some turnaround and decided not to be so spoiled and obsessed with money, she would have interested me more.-heather"
4,Cute,My 6 year old loves this costume. It's borderline too small but she'll get this Halloween out of it. It's made really well and a good deal for the price.
2,Not worth the money!!!,"My daughter broke several parts of this outfit before even finishing trick or treating. It is a very cheap poor material. We didn't even use the hat and wig because it looks so BAD and CHEAP!!!! My son got a $15 cowboy outfit from Walmart and it has lasted him 2 years. This one didn't even last a day!!!! Overall this outfit is only worth about $5 in my opinion, do not waste your money!!!!!!"
2,Okay Costume,"This costume did the trick of, well, of being a costume. My two year old hated it, however. The collar & sleeves are ginormous and made of a very scratchy, uncomfortable fabric. ALL of the tassels pulled off before Halloween even got here. They weren't pulled off by the two year old, they were pulled off by me during normal handling. So, basically, you get what you pay for. It's a cheap, poorly made, uncomfortable costume. The hat is cute, if only you could get a two year old to wear a hat!"
3,Fun Cowgirl Costume,"My 3-yr-old granddaughter loves this costume. Toddler size fits well--she's very slim. I thought the yarn hair was odd, but she likes it. I was also a little disappointed in the quality of the vest fabric which doesn't look like it will last long, and the neckline is not finished off properly. But, all in all, it's a cute costume!"
5,music,"love their music, been listing to them for years, they r great, saw them at byron jessup's church years ago, they were really good'"
3,it works,this mount works however my pda did not fit into it it was too big. i cut down the rubber on the sides of the mount so i can just barely squeeze my palm tungsten e2 into it
3,Please stop falling!!!,"This is a decent product aside from the fact that it's called a ""dashboard mount"" but the adhesive will NOT stick to a dashboard. After 30 minutes (and thoughtful consideration as to how I'll get my money back) I realized that the mount is designed to stick to the windshield. So strike #1 is...the product name is misleading. Next, the mount tends to fall off of the windshield during times of excessive heat/cold. On a really cold morning, I expect to see it on the floorboard of my truck. Likewise, on a hot afternoon it'll be in a similar position. Despite my groaning, it is a neat little product I guess."
2,Way too expensive!,The phone/PDA mount works great but I don't know why Amazon is charging $52.99 when you can buy directly from Garmin for $24.99.
3,Could be better............,"Having bought this CD I expected the REAL themes from great horror movies, instead we get a below average re-recording of all the songs and where it is NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET we actually get the score from the sequel. All in all it could have been better. Yet I still search for a more better soundtrax CD..."
4,Waterlillies from Hughes,"The lillies now are doing great. When we got them one was quite a bit larger than the other. After time and lots of sun one has twice as many ""pads"" as the other. They both are looking good."
2,All died after 4+ months,"I planted the water lily roots in a heated pond upon arrival. There were a few new leaves in the beginning. Then nothing happened after 4+ months, I took the planters out. All roots are rotten with very bad smell."
2,"Good company, bad product.","Even after reading the reviews, I thought this product would suit me. No! The brush head broke off early on in my first use and the lint hose attachment had the clogging problem the others described. I chalk it up to experience...read the reviews. Company shipped it fast."
3,It Works,"Not really worth the money I could have done the same thing with a clothes hanger, make your own homemade"
2,Not the greatest,"I was pretty disappointed in this product. The vent brush worked fine, but the vacuum attachment was worthless because it doesn't fit my upright vacuum (I have a Miele). I wish I'd spent more and gotten a product that fits my needs."
1,Disappointed,This product did not work as anticipated. The circular brush lost its shape after the first use. The handle on the straight brush was too short.
1,Ineffective,"I basically found the kit to be ineffective in getting the lint out that by-passed the dryers filter. The vacuum attachment was kinked from being stuffed in the small box --- and so far, the kinks have not come out. The tappered brush does a decent job of removing lint that is easy to get to but is difficult finding the way to turn it to go farther down the vent. I have not used the big round brush because the dryer must be pulled out of its nook. I can not recommend buying this item."
3,dryer lint remover,"This really gets the job done, when it comes to removing the lint build-up inside the dryer."
1,Dry Max Dryer Lint Removal Kit - Disappointing Product!,"Item was shipped/received very quickly, however, I was extremely disappointed with the lint removal kit. The flat hose did not work well in vacuuming because it was bent in several places in order to fit into the box. At each bend in the hose the lint could not suck through so therefore it stayed clogged. Also, a plastic piece on the kit broke off the first time I tried to use the system. So my purchase was a complete waste of money! I would not recommend this kit."
3,The Ontel Dryer-Max Lint Removal Kit,"We have a front loading GE dryer.Somewhat dissappointed with the product (but may be better than nothing.. ).The part that attaches to the vaccum cleaner, is somewhat wide and is not very flexbile, and doesn't reach deep enough.The small brush does NOT attach to the lint like ""magnet"" as they show it on TV. Also not very flexbile, and you can't reach all the area inside. You still have lint remaining inside.Have not tried the bigger brush yet.I think the price also is too much for what you get."
3,ok product,"The hose broke as soon as we connected it to our vacuum cleaner, so I at least would not recommend that part of this product, the brushes are ok"
1,Breaks right out of the box,"Opened it up and tried it. The plastic rod connected to the brush broke in less than 60 seconds trying to use it to clean the dryer vent. The rod does not have a metal core....just plastic, so when it is bending in the dryer vent....it broke, leaving the brush head inside the vent. Had to remove the entire vent and fish the head out. Would not recomend this product at all."
1,Doesn't work with stackables.,"I like the concept of the product but they need to list what types of dryers it was designed for. The vacuum attachment is very cheaply manufactured. Overall, I would not recommend this product."
2,did not really work,Turned out there was an exhaust problem that required a different solution (opening exhaust on outside of my house) but this thing was still too stiff to snake through an exhaust system that works itself up from the basement.
4,Pretty good quality,"Did not fit into my dryer vent, but will be useful for other purposes. Before purchasing make sure it'll fit inside your dryer vent."
1,Broke on first use,Would not recommend. Poor quality. Broke on the first use. Unable to find any information re: how to return the product - so it was a huge waste of money.
1,Vac attachment does not fit Electrolux,"The vac attachment doesn't fit my electrolux vacuum cleaner. The lint brush is awkwardly long for my front loading dryer, and didn't do a sufficient job cleaning the lint trap area. It was going to cost almost as much to ship back w/postage and a restocking fee, as it did to buy it, so I kept it.Customer service was good, however, in regards to response time when I emailed them. They gave me a return authorization # and all, but, like I said, it was cheaper to keep it."
1,waste of money,Ontel Dryer-Max Lint Removal KitThe vent pipe brush is packaged in a tight ball. Since the handle is made from a very flexible plastic it is impossible to straigten out to push through the vent pipe. My vent pipe was made from semi-rigid aluminum and I ended up tearing it and had to buy a new one.
2,"Okay set, bad packaging","The long brush is really weak, cheap and won't straightened out. The brush for cleaning the lint shoot in the dryer is a good quality good length brush. The vacuum tube is good, but since it was folded to fit into a small square box, it has squashed places in it that you can't un-squash and causes it to clog. Had this been packaged in a long box that did not require folding the vacuum tube, it would help alot."
1,Flimsy construction,I bought this to clean dryer exhaust pipe. The 15' brush has very flimsy rod so it won't turn inside the dryer hose so it is useless for me. I throw away packaging as soon as I get the item so can't even return it.
3,Dryer vent brush,"The brush for cleaning the dryer vent is a little stiff. It works, but is difficult to go through bends."
3,Not perfected yet!,The brushes work great but the hose to the vaccum cleaner is awkward and doesn't seem to fit the vaccum attachment. The hose has to be held on the vaccum to use it correctly. But overall it is a great product.
1,Don't buy it - waste of money,"There is a gap between the vacuum hose attachment and the hose on the vacuum which reduces the suction greatly. I tried using duct tape to close the gap, but that didn't work either."
1,A waste of money,"While the little brushes can come in handy the design of the flat tube piece for under appliances etc. is significantly of poor design. As other reviewers have noted the flat piece is a stiff plastic that arrives bent to fit in the box. Sadly the bend marks compromise the suction by crimping the tubing permanently and makes it fairly ineffective. Add to the the center tip has a bar that catches lint, pet dander, etc and immediately blocks off- again, making it worthless.Needs to be redesigned to a flexible softer plastic that doesn't crimp and has better suction. Plus the part that connects into vacuum tube is too small and leaves more air gap that decreases suction.Too much money for just a couple of small brushes that might work cause the plastic vacuum piece is garbage."
3,Dry Max Dryer Lint Removal Kit,"I ordered the three piece dryer Lint removal kit through Amazon.com and received my order this morning. I right away used it to remove lint from my dryer. It works okay and I got a lot of stuff out of my dryer. I also used the brush to loosen debris, worked really well.I was happy to clean it all out for the first time since my dryer was bought.I have to say the flexible attachment was handy, yet could use improvements in making it large enough to handle everything you suck out of your dryer. It clogged up many times and had to be unclogged.All in all....I am glad I got that stuff out of my dryer."
3,2 Out of 3,"2 Out of 3 items isn't bad. The 36"" wand and the vacuum attachment are worth the price of admissin. The 10' duct brush is worthless though. The limp attachment is too flimsy to actually propel the brush through the duct. DON'T BUY IT FOR THIS TOOL!!!"
3,How about the Having of Original Ideas?,"Although the book was inciteful, it seemed to be a little less than original. As a result of studying under Jean Piaget, Eleanor Duckworth (author of the Having of Wonderful Ideas) learned a great deal about cognitive development. However, her ideas for the book and her foundation for the book was simply restating much of Piaget's work adding her own interpretations here and there. Many of these ""interpretations"" were quite helpful in further understanding Piaget's work, but most were not. Anyone familiar with Piaget's work might find this particular text somewhat repetitive."
2,Some Wonderful Ideas,"""The Having of Wonderful Ideas"", by Eleanor Duckworth, was not quite what I expected. Although I learned from some aspects of the book I expected more ""ideas"" that could easily be understood and incorporated into classroom activities. I felt that the essays on the many experiments conducted by the author and Piaget were far too lengthy, almost drowning out any real ""wonderful ideas"". This book is not easy to read, and may leave the reader struggling to read to the end. However, as I stated previously, I did learn a few things, but they came too far and few between the lengthy essays."
2,Having of Wonderful Ideas? A BIT MISLEADING!,"This book is one of the most difficult books I have ever read. It seems to me that the author, Eleanor Duckworth, simply gathered a great deal of dreadfully boring, scientific information and put it in one pile. For the most part, I feel like I had to read parts at least 3 times for it to make sense. In all fairness, though, there are some good ideas in the book and that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. The title is very much misleading, in my opinion. It should have been called something like - ""A CATALOGUE OF WHAT SOMEONE ELSE THOUGHT WAS WONDERFUL IDEAS"". Good luck to all who attempt this one - know in advance what you are getting into and it might not be so bad."
1,You get what you pay for!!!,"Hello, the item arrived on time, but at my surprise when I opened the box, it was all bent. One of the side doors was bent so much that the enamel was chipped. The bottom grid also was bent, along with the sides of the cage. Cheap item both in price AND QUALITY. I do not think I am going to buy anything else from this seller."
1,Cheap,"This cage was purchased for our Male canary. It took some time for the cage to arrive but when it did, the box was ripped and when my daughter and wife removed the cage from the box, all the wire panels were bent. Plastic wire ties had to be used to keep the wire panels together after assembly. As my wife hung the cage up, the plastic tray slid right out onto the floor spilling all its contents. The tray will not support any type of bottom bedding and even slides out with 3 layers of newspaper. I do not recommend this cage at all and am sorry to have waisted my money on it."
3,Okay,"This cage was just okay. I bought it as a sleep and travel cage for my two peach faced lovebirds. I needed a small, easily portable cage with a divider since they can't be trusted to get along unsupervised.I'm disappointed with the barred divider, however. It doesn't fit in securely because it's a tad too small for the thing that it's supposed to slide into. I ended up having to secure it by connecting it to the top of the cage with stretched out paper clips."
1,Not a SAMS 24 hours book - Think tiwce before buying,"I always biy SAMS 24 hours books; but this one, for my surprise is not so good.The author do not drive you over Dreamweaver, but teach you some features, not respecting any order, or your knowledge.Instead drive you step by step with a small project, this book will learn you some features, and you won't be able to do anything at the end of the book if you don't have any experience in web page building."
2,"20,000,000 Macintosh users ignored","This is the first time that I have seen a book about a cross platform application that completely ignores one of the platforms.For example, the author never mentions when she refers to the control key that it is the command key on a Mac. Worse yet is the fact that when referring to right click/context menus she never mentions that Mac users can control click to access these menus. Without this knowledge, these menus are unavailable to Mac users!Although this book served it's purpose for me (an experienced hand-coder who wanted to learn the DW interface) I was also disappointed that it was not project oriented. In the same- or lower- price range, the Visual Quick Start Guide would have served the same purpose in my case."
2,Sams Teach Yourself DW4 in 24 hours,"Being a newbie to DW4, I knew that to get up and running that the DW4 manual would be insuffient. ""Sams Teach Yourself Macromeda Dreamweaver 4"" was about the only book available at the time to get me over those initial speed bumps of DW4's moderate learning curve.The biggest problem with the book is the assumption that you know where all of the menu items are located along with the associated icons. The book did a particularly poor job of describing how to implement layers and if there was a money back guarantee I'd ask for my money back."
5,Love it!!!!,"Compact but still I can put everything I need for to go in the mountains take some nice pictures (I'm able to put my Canon Rebel XT plus 3 lens,...)well finished."
4,Great for the price!,"these little things are awesome! you just need a light socked and an outlet and your set. i bought some cheap home depot clamp work lights and i can clamp them wherever i want. they trigger optically so they are easy to use. you can also plug directy into the light using a provided PC cable. using that PC cable, i was able to sync the flash up to 1/4000, but thats only cause thats the top speed of my camera! the only reason i didnt give them 5 stars is because you cant control the power output. but you can just bump up the f-stop and it will be darker."
5,Simply the best,"I've bought quite a few watering wands over the years from the ""box"" stores - but this one from Dramm is by far the best I've ever experienced! A nice, soft, even stream surprises you about how much water is actually being dispensed."
2,Good quality but limited flow control,I bought some cheap wand sprayers which only lasted a season so I decided to buy one of better quality. This one was nice quality wise but using it in my garden around the smaller plants I found it just put out to much water. It overwhlemed the smaller plants knocking them over. Turning the control to reduce flow causing it to just drip water. Went back to a cheaper brand with better control.
1,Bad quality,The ink pad doesn't soak up ink evenly. So some numbers shows with too much ink and some with too little ink. And the ink smears everywhere and makes my paper look very messy.
4,sexy,I was shopping for some womens unmentionables with my husband for 30 years. My husband chose this particular women's sheer garter belt panty hose for me. He was excited when it arrived in the mail and could not wait until evening for me to try it on and model it. We both like it but he likes it more than I do. It is very sexy in his words. Thanks again for the wonderful product and looking forward in shopping for more womens unmentionables in the months ahead.
2,"Okay, but wont last long","Concept is great; however, they are very sheer and easy to snag. Good for one use and then they are gone!"
2,Not as pictured,I agree with the person who said that they looked like regular pantyhose with holes cut out on the sides...and I have long legs. They don't look like garters at all.
