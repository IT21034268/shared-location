1,out of scale jeep,This was my first real disappointment from Hasegawa. This jeep is so out of scale that the figure couldn't even fit in it. Why provide 7 figures for a gun and jeep that are at 1/80 scale?
2,Disappointed,My installation had to be postponed because there were bolts missing from the packing. I expected the necessary parts for proper installation to be provided by Chamberlain. Silly me.....
4,Some minor problems,"The opener came with no remotes in the package, The Chamberlain company customer care was very good and shipped out the remotes promptly. After the installation, while adjusting the travel settings, the motor would not respond to the opening adjusting screw until I screwed it all the way in, and it then seemed to have broken off inside. However the unit began to work fine. I hope that it never needs adjusting in the future. The adjusting screws are white neoprene, and are enclosed deep inside the motor housing. The opener works fine though."
5,"So far, so good","Our old Chamberlain garage door opener died after 17 years, so we chose this one as a replacement. It was delivered on time, in tact and was fairly straight forward to install (my husband did the installation on his own.)We did not replace the existing motion detector light things because the old ones seemed to still be good, so that was a little time that was saved, and they did/do still work.We really like the feature of the ability to put in two 100 watt bulbs for extra light in the garage, although it's getting harder and harder to find 100 watt incandescent bulbs. One can also click the ""light"" button to have extra light while working in the garage.The belt drive is incredibly quiet compared to the old chain-driven openers. I would recommend to a friend that this is a good buy."
3,"Good performance, cheaper construction than previous models","This was a product marked used/warehouse opened product. The box was a bit torn up but otherwise no damage, well worth the savings over new.The install went fine and the product works great. I gave it 3 stars by comparing it to an opener I purchased 10 years ago in the same class of lower to mid-range level opener. You can really tell Chamberlain has cut product parts quality likely to keep pricing down. Especially of concern is the Multi-function Control Panel. I can really see this breaking down the road because of poor, plastic construction. Also, the controls to adjust Up and Down travel limits are very hard to work as they are recessed inside the machine, accessed by placing a screw driver through holes. On the other side, literally, the Force adjustments are very easy to access."
2,Hidden costs abound,"Great door opener--quiet and easy to install--but Sears apparently feels compelled to stick it to the consumer at every turn. It was only after opening the box and taking inventory of the contents that the instructions mentioned that the opener in the box was only good for a 7 foot door. 8 and 10 foot doors require an extension kit--a $75+ (including shipping) box that contains a metal rail and a longer belt. That kit is a rip-off, considering it adds 45% to the original $180 cost of the basic opener. The basic opener also did not include brackets required to mount the system to a finished ceiling nor did it come with extenders required to mount the safety reversing electric eyes in most garages...another ""accessory"" you can order from Sears--for an additional charge, of course."
4,Chamberlain WD822KD Whisper Drive 1/2-HP Belt Drive Garage Door Opener,Length:: 2:08 MinsShort video on the finished installation and operation of the Chamerlain Whisper Drive 1/2 horse power garage door opener.
3,Won't fit in all garages,"I ordered this garage door opener only to find after assembling the track that it would not fit in my garage. It is not adjustable for length. You would expect that a belt would be adjustable, but the ends are crimped and not subject to adjustment. This opener requires almost 11 horizontal feet of space and in my garage a beam and pillar only allow 9 horizontal feet for the opener and its track. This is not adequately documented in the specifications, manual or Amazon's website that I could find.Repacking and returning this product is difficult and expensive. The track locks together so disassembling it would likely result in damage. I had to take a loss and sell it locally to avoid taking it apart.To fit a garage door opener in this space I had to purchase a screw-drive unit and leave out the middle section. This has worked well for our one piece garage door."
2,remotes are crap!!,Even after changing to a fresh lithium battery my remote only works while directly in front of the garage. My old Craftsman opener could work from two houses down the street. Customer service from Chamberlains horrible voice mail system is a joke. I'm regretting this purchase.
5,"Easy directions, easy installation and quiet!","I'm very happy with my choice with this garage door opener. I installed it (with help from a friend) on a 7 foot x 16 foot solid door. The directions were clear and all the parts were in the packaging (no missing parts). The sensors worked without a lot of adjusting. This opener is super quiet, they were not kidding when they said whisper. If you're a novice at doing handyman stuff, ask a friend to help with the install and make sure you have the tools required. Also verify your door size does not exceed the specs for this model. I couldn't be happier with my purchase decision. Great price and no problems at all. I did initially have concerns about purchasing a belt drive vs. screw driven, but it has a 10 year warranty on the belt... the motor is lifetime. For under $200, you can't go wrong."
5,Good Directions and Easy Installation,I just purchased and installed this door yesterday. The instructions are extremely clear and well written. The quality of the opener components is high and installation was a breeze. I was replacing an older opener that broke and was able to reuse the sensors and door mount. It took about 90 minutes from start to finish and is very quiet in operation.
4,Chamberlain Whisper Drive,This is the second Whisper Drive we have purchased and installed. We purchased the second one based on how well the original unit has worked for us. It is truly quiet and works very smoothly. I don't think you can beat the product for the price.
5,Great value,This is my third Chamberlain purchase...this one I installed in a rental property. Other two have been flawless for 4 plus years. Easy to install (not that any of these things are really easy) with snap together arms. Very quiet and no messy grease or other annoying maintenance. Highly recommend.
4,Great quite garage door opener,"This is not a detailed review, just want to say that after about 4 months of use, we are very happy with the Chamberlain garage door opener. It is super quiet, and it works, what else could I say? In terms of installing it, we definitely had to hire help; but it has more to do with the condition of our door and garage than with the difficulty of the project itself. We will for sure consider buying again from Chamberlain."
4,Open - closed,"Very happy, works great... I have a 7.5ft sectional door that the opener doesn't completely open but my cars enter without a problem so I didn't buy the extension kit, works fine for me but wish the opener was designed with a little more travel without having to buy an add on."
4,Excellent product once I aquired the missing parts,"The opener is dead silent, fairly smooth, and appears well built. The instructions were adiquite if one is already a do-it-your-selfer already and can read between the lines. My bifggest issue is the same as many others have reported: missing fasteners and a lack of a needed bracket piece. For a high end unit, they really should get cheap on the consumer and leave out parts for ANY reason. Searching for these, cost me an extra hour.All in all would buy it again."
2,Hidden Costs! + 32%,"I purchased this in Dec 2007 for $199.99 - great price. Now just got around to put it up and Wow, the rail is only good for 7' doors. I had to shell out another $63 (part, tax, shipping) to Chamberlain to get the 8' accessory kit. That's an additional 32% over the original price! And, the additional part is only an extra 1' piece of metal (rail) and a longer belt. The price for the add on is outrageous! I cannot attest to how this opener works, as I am awaiting the part so I can install it. However, the experience of having to spend 32% more for this is a poor one and this was not a good buy in the end due to the added hidden cost! I searched the Amazon description and nowhere was the 7' limitation mentioned! Shame on Amazon for this! FYI, Chamberlain sells 8' and 10' extension kits."
2,Definitely not what I expected,"The opener installed reasonably well. The price is reasonable, if I had not had problems (excessive noise and failure). I had the opener for just over 6 months when it failed. I used the owner's manual to isolate the failure to two possible options. I checked the warranty and it was only validate if you shipped the opener to the company without opening the cover. Not knowing how long this would take, I opened the cover and inspected the parts. I purchased ($30) and installed the first possible repair option from the owner's manual; it did not repair the problem. The second option was going to be of a new opener, so I went and purchased another opener. Disappointed in it only lasting just over 6 months, and the noise is/was more than the new screw-drive opener that I purchased as a replacement."
4,My First Experience With Belt Drive,"In the past, I've had either screw or chain drive garage door openers. This is my first experience with a belt drive model. It's quiet and smooth operating. Even though the installation instructions were vague, I managed to assemble and install the unit myself. Let's see how the belt handles our Arizona dry heat..."
3,Only supports 7 foot door.. 8 foot Mod kit extra $$$,The opener has been installed for approx 2 weeks and has been working fine after I overcame two significant problems1. The opener is packaged to support a 7 foot door not a 8 ft door. I didn't figure this out until the installation was complete. I had to order and spend approx. $60 more to buy the 8ft extension mod kit from the mfg. The mod kit requires you to uninstall the unit (drop it back to the floor) remove front bar and replace belt and tension spring..THE 7FT LIMITATION IS NOT STATED ON THE AMAZON WEB PAGE2. The belt would twist slightly between the right side of tension spring and motor. The mfg. sent new belt and spring assy. which didn't resolve issue. I ended up modifying the spring assy and the opener is now running fine.If I had known that a mod kit was needed I would never have ordered the opener $$$$$$$
4,Chamberlain Garage Door Opener,"Purchased two of these openers to replace 20 year old units. They work well and are quiet. The instructions are good and assembly easy. Since I had old hardware to steal from, I am not sure if all bolts are supplied for mounting. The angle metal that is supplied to mount the drive end to the ceiling is flimsy(that they supplied anything is surprising to me) Most hardware stores and lumber yards have heavier material. As always mounting the unit to the ceiling is the tricky part. Since each installation will be different, it is up to the installer to figure out how to secure the unit.I like the extra features this unit offers. An outside keypad, and an extra button on the inside control to just turn on the light. They offer some other features you can add the the unit but I don't remember what they are (they may have more information in the description of the unit).I would recommend this garage door opener."
4,Whisper Drive Installed 9-2-05... Bill AZ,"Item replaced an older installed Craftsman opener. Was able to use existing holes in all locations when old hardware removed. Pre-assembly was very easy, with exception of broken Link Clip when securing the belt to the Trolley assembly. I was able to salvage one from the Craftsman Chain driven assembly. Almost cancelled order due to estimated delivery date, however Amazon was a bit off and the product was received in time for my weekend installation."
5,Chamberlain Whisper Drive,This product is running very quiet as they said. Took me about 2.5 hrs to replace with my old Craftman. I was able to use the existing brackets for my 7 feet high garage door. This is a good product.
3,"Great product, directions for install ...?","I had an older model of the belt drive, from Chamberlain. It gave me twenty one years, of,continuous service. That is why I opted for another, similar product.Unfortunately, the directions are very hard to follow.only a few of the pieces. look the same in the diagrams. I think that the printers, automatically, assume, that I know what each part is called. Because there is no definition of them, included.I have a limited, mechanical, background. (Although I installed the old one, by myself, in only a few hours)I can only hope, that the opener, lasts as long as it'll take me, to install it.After three hours, I finally took a break. Not even half way done.The directions, couldn't be harder to follow, than if written, in Chinese.Well? It's time to try and decipher, what the next step is.Will add update."
5,Perfect item,"Absolutely incredible ! So quiet I have to look at it to see if it is working..... After years of others, I wish I had bought this one forst."
5,"Easy to install, very quiet","Amazon had this to me in 2 days.Took me an afternoon to install. Installation instructions are thorough and easy to understand.This is a very quiet garage door opener.Zero issues. Very happy with this product. If my other opener dies, we'll be buying another one of these. Worth every penny."
5,Great unit,"I was nervous about purchasing on line. The product came in when promised. The initial setup was easy, you have to read the instructions first. The uint is quiet and I did not have to make any additional adjustments. Chamberlain is the best."
1,"""BUYER BEWARE""",If you have an 8 foot door you will end up having to buy an extension kit which will end up costing you another $50+ and shipping and not get credited back for the useless belt and rail that actually came with it. No where does it say for a 7' door only .... Very discouraging and tempted to just send the whole mess back.
5,works great,"works just great and some reviews said it didn't have all the hardware needed to install it, but I did not need any extra hardware for the install. I have not got around to programming my car to work with the opener. It works great"
1,The one on Home Depot comes with Motion sensor and lightning remote.,For the same price you can buy at Home Depot the unit that comes with the Lightning remote for your house and Motion sensor..I am disappointment.
5,Great power!,Tons of suction power and a super price! Fast shipping from Amazon also. Love the sweeper and Amazon!
1,ambiguity!,"This product is intended for installation at 120volts, the cost of a step down voltage converter for operation in the uk is virtually the same as buying the product. It should therefore not be offered on the uk market. I have been in touch with chamberlain USA and they are not particulary helpful in that they do not ship to countries with a different voltage.I would be pleased to know what Amazon Export Sales Inc intend doing, the unit cost me 218.78 in total and thus far it has been a waste of money.Peter"
3,Remote Keypad going bad,"I've had this opener for almost 3 years. It worked great until the last year, then sometimes I had to press the enter key twice or really hard on the keypad, and now in the last 4 months, over 1/2 the time, I can't open with keypad, or I am sitting outside for 10 minutes putting in the code over and over again until it opens. I'm currently looking online for repair/replacement options for the keypad."
5,Works flawlessly,"It took me about 3 hours to install. I had no help so did it by myself. Normal difficulties with installing, but directions were clear and it installed seamlessly. The amazing part is when I ran it. It is so quiet. We have a heavy wood double garage door. It was so noisy before with the chain opener. We have a bedroom above the garage and it quite often woke my daughter up when I left early in the morning. Now she rarely knows it opens. I highly recommend this garage door opener!"
3,Buy an opener that does not need the sensors,"Installation was fairly easy, however after struggling to install the sensors on my very old garage door frame I decided to run the garage door opener without them (no kids or pets so no requirement just now) however the garage door opener only opens without the sensors and can not close. There is no way to bypass either. The only way this opener closes is when the sensors are operational and aligned. This is a big negative for me as I can see some kicking the sensors or they just failing over a period of time then I will have to either install a new garage opener or buy new sensors (for some ridiculous price probably). Buy an opener that does not need sensors to operate"
3,open box ???,"Bought as a gift, looks like it had been opened previously???? ie open box, because it had been restapled. We'll find out when it gets installed"
1,Worst than useless garage door opener,Do not include the required hardware to completely install.Instructions a TerribleSlow and Expensive Opener
5,Easy to install and whisper quiet.,"I am a noise freak and this thing is great. I installed both the 1/2 and 3/4 HP versions of this for a single and double door respectively. Both are extremely quiet (the neighbors agree). From upstairs, I can no longer hear the garage door opening when my wife gets home. This unit took about 2 hours for me to install but only because I had to reposition a light in the garage to make room. Also there was no previous unit in this spot so I had to position it from scratch.At one point a second person is required to assist with the installation. I got around this by stablely positioning an igloo cooler on the top of a ladder and positioning the opener on top. So it can be done by 1 person with a little ingenuity."
5,Very happy customer,Very happy with this purchase. I finished installing 2 garage door opener last week-end. I am also delighted that Amazon sent it with FedEx next day shipping for free. This was unexpected.
4,Squeaky Quite,"Door opener was fairly easy to install,good instructions, But it is a little squeaky seems to be in the Belt."
5,Farnon Magic,These are great sounding superlative Farnon arrangements under the maestro's baton - what more can you ask for! Let the magic begin after you put it into your compact disc player and press the play button. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
4,Murphy Blend - 'First Blend' (Kuckuck),"Originally released in 1971, as this was the German 'heavy progressive' band's sole album. Tunes here that did the most for me were ""Speed Is Coming Your Way"", ""Pradudium / Use Your Feet"" the awesome seven-minute ""Firt Loss"" and the quite cleverly-arrainged ""Funny Guys"". Personnel: Wolfgang Rumler - guitar & vocals, Andreas Scholz - bass, Wolf-Rodiger Uhlig - organ, grand piano & vocals and Achim Schmidt - drums. Should appeal to fans of Uriah Heep, Sperrmull, 2066 And Then and perhaps those fans who really dig those Led Zeppelin rarites and less-remembered album cuts."
4,coffeetable book of astrology,"Entertaining, enlightening, thought provoking, and to a degree somewhat accurate. Enjoyable when I first read it 35 years ago. GREAT conversation starter....."
5,Haiku Punk,"There are many short songs in this album and they (specially songs in side B.) sound like punk version of Haiku. It's a style of Japanese traditional poem consisting of seventeen syllables. And each song has strong character because they put excellent ideas into each song. For example, if you listen to the song ""Pie War"", you can easily understand why it is the tittle. This song sounds just like ""Pie War""! This feeling is similar to the feeling when you see magic or comedy.. Songs in this album is music but not normal music. Highly recommended to the people who love both art & punk."
3,Not what I expected,"Ok, I ordered this CD because it was a new release, it is infact a rerelease of Melt Banana's earliest tapes from 93 and 94. I was expecting a NEW album instead of poor recording half songs. It definately is Melt Banana, and the music is just as creative as their other stuff, but the songs are very brief, and the recording quality is AWFUL. Only for collectors I'd say, buy Charlie instead."
3,Dissapointed,"The phone looks so much better in the picture.1) Buttons are made from thick rubber (reminds me technology from the 80s-90s), very crude and ugly in my opinion2) Can not use it in the dark as the buttons do not lit3) Does not have a one button DO NOT DISTURB function like other Uniden models do, alrough you do get the option to silence the ringer by using buttons on both the handset and the base (my understanding is that you have to do both)Other that the above the phone functions very well with Vonage service. Do I recommend it? Not really. You can probably find a nicer looking phone with as good or better quality.I hope this helps"
2,A whole lotta nothin,"I bought this book thinking that it would reveal personal secrets and details of prominent blacks like MLK, Malcolm X, etc. This book reiterates the same thing over and over, The FBI was bad, and Hoover was a racist. Too many names and titles were interjected thruought the book. As soon as the author touches on an interesting topic, he leaves it and goes to something else thats very dull. I kept reading, waiting for the good stuff to come. It never came. Don't waste your money on this one, Its boring and dull."
5,Very Interesting World,"Samaria, the world Sharon Shinn invents in these novels, may be perhaps the most original concept I've read in quite a while. The fast-paced prose carries you through the love story between Rachel and Gabriel, the Archangel-elect of Samaria. They must battle the evil Raphael, the corrupt current Archangel who does not want to let go of his power, to save faithful men and angels. I can't wait for future books to reveal all because the angels aren't exactly divine beings, and the way the prophets talk to their god is through a computer terminal. A compelling and satisfying love story of the sort that is all too often missing from the science fiction genre."
2,Too much mediocre romance and not enough sci-fi,"I loved the concept of the book, but I wasn't thrilled with ANY of the characters. I found them either annoying or profoundly unengaging.I found some of the theology in the book mildly interesting.I really enjoy reading science fiction and romance and do not even mind a blend of the two genres if it is well written. If you enjoy the ""futuristic romance"" genre, you will probably enjoy this book. Unfortunately, that genre has some of the worst writing of both sci fi AND romance. Archangel is one of the better novels in that genre, but, alas, that is not saying much."
3,Good. If you like Chick Lit.,"Recently, I have generally steered clear of the NYT Bestselling page-turners, but this one was a snoozer. In all, fairness, it is fairly well written, but it was not what I was looking for.There were no plot twists. The plot was simple, sweet, straightforward, and fairly predictable.While the book revolved around politics and religion, I didn't feel that the author really asked any thought provoking questions. Do you believe in God? yes or no.The characters were beautifully developed if that what you seek in a book.Basically, this is a love story of two people who didn't choose each other.Nothing new."
2,A Romance novel in disguise,"As smoothly written as this book is (the author is, after all, a practiced journalist of 20 some years) it suffers from a lack of tension (we know the protagonist is going to ""get"" her ""angel"" in the end, a no-brainer) and its clear deportment as a Romance novel in disguise. Most of the reviewers here have been women and they have elevated Ms. Shinn to the ranks of bestsellerdom because of her leanings toward Romance. To her credit Shinn's protagonist has a bit more assertiveness that the usual female lead in sf novels, but that is all given up when she achieves what she's after in the end. This book actually made me feel creepy, something only Orson Scott Card has been able to do. Brrr."
2,Strictly for the unicorn set.,"This exemplifies everything that's wrong with 'chick SF': The histrionic characters, the slapdash plot, the gratuitous, predictable, and manipulative drama. Hard to believe this is the same Shinn that wrote the excellent _The Shape-Changer's Wife_.I'm sure the same people that buy the endless outpouring of Perncrap will get this. I guess someone has to keep the McCaffrey ghostwriters in biscuits and cold water."
4,"well, i finished it","Eh, this book was okay. I bought it because of all the rave reviews here on Amazon and in a lot of ways, I agree with them. The world and concept are wonderfully interesting but I wish they had been handled better. The two main characters were supposedly ""in love"" but bickered and were at odds almost constantly. That was the most annoying part of the book and distracted me from the interesting concepts. The musical aspect was handled espcially well and at times I could almost hear the singing. A good book but not a new fantasy classic. I thought about buying the sequel but decided it wasn't worth it."
4,These books sneak gently into your heart,I look forward to watching Sharon Shinn develop as a writer. Her style is as warm and homey as a Sunday roast with potatoes and sticks to your ribs just as much. I grew to love her characters and finish her books with a deep sense of satisfaction from a walk in her worlds.
4,Caution - spoiler for the ending within my review,"I adored this book right up until the end. It was recommended to me from folks on a Fantasy/Romance website, so unlike some other reviewers I enjoyed the relationship aspect of the story. I agree wholeheartedly with all the other 5 star reviews, but I took away a star because, coming at this novel as a romance reader, I was disappointed that we see no more than a couple of kisses between Gabriel and Rachel. I don't need a graphic love scene to make me happy, but some sort of consummation would have been a nice conclusion to the romantic build up Shinn wove so well. That is my only complaint, and likely a trivial one to most other readers, about an otherwise incredible novel. I will be reading the others in the series as soon as I can."
1,Painful,"Gabriel, a future Archangel, has been told the name of his bride. He is to go to where she is enslaved, bring her home, and marry. Rachel, his intended, is not crazy about the idea but concedes. This is the basic plot in ARCHANGEL.Miss Shinn does a great job building her world in which the book is set, but I found myself offended with some of her liberties. Setting that aside, I focused on the characters. Rachel and Gabriel were annoying and as easy to embrace as a cactus. They fought throughout the entire book and were constantly finding reasons to be apart from each other. As much as I tried, I never reached a point where anything about them endeared them to me."
5,"""And He shall give His angels charge over thee ...""","I read this book in two days; it has been many years sincesuch a thing occurred in my life. I had even despaired that there were no more good tales out there to be told. This is most assuredly one of them.The melding of angel & mortal, in the face of faith versus unbelief, lifted my spirits. The characters were so real to me, I was near to tears by the end of the book. I did not want to leave them; they had become as real to me as true friends. The story is one of adventure & betrayal & eventually right overcoming wrong. But along the way, like any good story, there is much to be seen & tasted & felt.I look forward to ""Jovah's Angel"" with great anticipation!"
3,Heart breaking Love story with a Foolish/childish/annoying heroine,"I enjoyed the book generally, I just couldn't stand Rachel the main female character, she was so childish , she does something and expects a certain reaction from Gabriel and if doesn't occur as she anticipates she goes on with her accusation and Tantrum.She mislead him never opened up to him and yet blamed him constantly.She is one of the worst female character's i have ever read . She Ruined the Plot.IF you get irritated easily DO NOT READ THE BOOK."
5,One of my favorite books of 99,"I thought that Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials Books I and II were my best discoveries of the year. Of course, this was until the week in June when I started reading Archangel. I finished it, got in my car, and purchased the sequal. This time however, I did something I rarely do when I this excited about a book; I DID NOT start the second book. I spent the next 24 hours re-reading Archangel. Only when sections were committed to memory purely through sheer familiarity did I start the second book. And of course, the sequel had not even hit the floor before I was on my way to buy the last in the series. As a whole the series is amazing, however Archangel is my absolute favorite."
3,Just a romance.,"If you take ""Gone With the Wind,"" strap some big angel wings on Rhett Butler's back, and reverse Scarlett's economic timeline (poor to rich instead of rich to poor), you've got the basic jist of this book. Any remotely new idea in this book merely serves as a plot device to fuel the cliche romance that is the real heart of this book. If you read speculative fiction for new ideas to fuel your imagination, you'll probably be disappointed. If, however, you're a big fan of romance novels, you might well love this book"
2,Disappointed,"I have read several of Sharon Shinn's books and found them entertaining. This one was not. I read all the reviews about the great love story the book was; I never found that to be true. The story skated around Gabriel and Rachel constantly with little if any interaction between the two for most of the book. When were together, they fought. I realize there's the popular antagonist views many writers use in romantic novels, yet this was so overused that I liked neither of the characters and could see how they didn't like each other. I particularly did not like Rachel, the main female character."
1,"Interesting Fantasy World, But","I read a lot of Sci Fi and Fantasy. I read one of Sharon Shinn's more recent works and liked it a lot. This book started out interesting. As it progressed the number of missed oppotunities began to get anoying. It was kind of like watching ""Three's Company"", everybody on a different track. A third of the way in I started speed reading thinking it would get better. Wrong! The lead character Rachel never matured and stayed as obnoxious as ever. When she walked away AGAIN near the end, I did a rare thing and put the book down in frustration with 40 pages to go. How it ends I don't care. It was a long path to nowhere. A waste of a good imagination."
5,An unusual and stunningly beautiful love story.,"After reading Sharon Shinn's novel, Archangel, I was amazed at her skillful weaving of biblical myth and a quickly progressing world. Her rather subtle opinions on faith, progress, technology, and people were very interesting to interpret. I found her characters, especially the all-too-human angels deep and memorable. This is a book I will read again and again, and enjoy more every time."
2,Can anyone say DVDR????,"The Movie is an excellent 50's Sci Fi Starring John Agar, Love these ol' Things.Now this DVD that it shows here is from Retroflicks...is not a commercial pressed DVD it is a DVDR and when it was available it sold for $15 here at Amazon. The Movie itself is OK I am just upset that it was never mentioned on this site about it being a DVDR and the Price it sold for....I wanted it, so I kept it because no offical DVD has ever been released.My 2 Cents"
2,Pack up your woes,"Vanguard Visionaries is an extraordinarily disappointing series, given that the label is being so stingy with its offerings. The label has an excellent roster. If they wanted to publicise their archives, they could have been a great deal more generous at this price - or else offered it for $6 or so. It's also disappointing that Vanguard is ignoring some of the wonderful stuff in its archives and focusing instead on meaningless releases of this variety - the ""greatest hits"" by the same artists, on the same label, are a much better deal."
4,Urban Legends,"A decent overview of America's monster phenoms. Not a whole lot on any one subject, but makes for entertaining reading. Everything from Bigfoot to creatures totally unheard of by most. Not bad."
5,STOP WINING AND OPEN UP YOUR MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've read some nasty reviews here, but rest assured that this book is one of the most organized and interesting you'll ever read on the subject. Personally, I love this book because of the way Blackman combines supernaturalism and cryptozoology into a realistic zoological field guide. Plus, the tips on how to hunt monsters give you something to do on boring days. I can't get enough of the enigmatic monsters in this marvelous book, and I really think you should give it a chance. So open up your mind, open up this book, and let it work its magic. Remember, it may come in handy some day..."
1,Gives Cryptozoology a Bad Name!,"Type in ""cryptozoology"" at Amazon.com. Now buy any other book than this one. Almost any other book, that is, as you do have to also avoid that fictional thing by the Cryptozoology Society of London. You'll find out 100 times more about the subject by buying something else than you would learn buying this tome. Buyer beware. Heaven help us!"
2,"If you want to know about cryptozoology, don't read this.","This book passes itself off as a large overview of fascinating creatures which are rumoured to exist, yet winds up trudging into the rediculous and silly. While the book does contain some nice references in the form of photos and drawings from actual paranormal cases, it also delves into childishness like boogeymen and jackalopes.Another problem with this book is the lack of good organization. It skips around a good bit and seperates things like Sasquatch and Skunk-apes, which are obviously similar, if not the same thing.In short, I believe this would be a good book for a third grader interested in the unknown, but anyone looking for facts should look elsewhere. Read Grover Krantz's ""Big Footprints"" or John Green's ""Year of the Bigfoot""."
5,entertaining,"This book is entertaining in that it's humoristic but it also provides some nice insights into Native American as well as local folklore and decent cryptozoology/paranormal info.No it's not Keel,Coleman,or Sanderson,but it's worth reading."
1,"inept, silly retread","This takes much of the same information from other books on cryptozoology and deals with it in a pop manner, with silliness and large discussions of movies, again from a popular, capsule review sort of way. That is to say it falls somewhere between _Entertainment Weekly_ and _Weekly World News_, which is not a pleasant combination. There is little in this book that cannot be gleaned from other, better written and less condescending sources."
1,Cheap shot!,"It's simple and cheap. They should make it more better than this. I do except to see various colorful pictures, photos of all kinds. This is not ideal for true cryptrozoology! I rather book entitled ""all about Monsters"" and ""Mystery Creatures"" over this."
4,A biography & an interpretation,"I was interested in learning more about King David, but wanted something more like a ""novel,"" than a heavy in-depth biography. I never seemed to find anything like that, but went with this one because of the author's reputation. Swindoll provides an entertaining account of the events in David's life, using scripture and also lively contemporary language. What I did not expect, but have enjoyed, is that he also draws parallels between David's actions and other Bible events, and also applies to modern life some lessons to be learned from David. I have found these digressions from a ""just the facts, ma'am"" approach to be interesting and, in some cases, thought-provoking. If, however, a reader would prefer a book that is strictly a biographical account of David's life, this may not be the best choice. I gave it 4 stars because occasionally the author gets a bit too preachy."
5,I WOULDN'T MISS A SWINDOLL BOOK!,This book is interesting and informative from start to finish. I feel like I know and understand King David as I never did before.
5,"Added Di""VINE""ness to my day!","This product was delivered on time (as usual) and came in a very portable container. The smell of this product is wonderful and it is a wonderful hydrator, especially if you have oily/dry skin. It finds the right balance of what your skin needs.Tips for Use:Use this product with Natures Gate Lite Switch. Along with this, use this product (with the Lite Switch) in the morning of a day where you will not use the night serums and etc. If morning and night creams are used on the same days acne could result."
3,Disappointing,"Not as good as I had hoped. The product doesn't moisturize as well as I'd like. Plus, no sunscreen."
5,Walt Whitman's physician wisely prescribes compartmentalizn',"He concludes with a moment with Walt Whitman who ""never spoke to me much of his poems though occasionally he would make a quotation; but I remember late one summer afternoon as we sat in the window of his little house in Camden there passed a group of workmen whom he greeted in his usual way. And then he said: 'Ah, the glory of the day's work, whether with hand or brain! I have triedTo exalt the present and the real, To teach the average man the glory of his daily work or trade.'Dr. Osler concludes: ""In this way of life each one of you may learn to drive the straight furrow and so come to the true measure of a man."""
5,Not an anime regular...,"...but I loved this series. Great entertainment. Great fun. Great for adults without having too many extra weird things going on. Vulgar? Yes. Obscene? Sometimes. But it was by far the best Anime I've seen. Can't go wrong here with this one, well, until you get to the last 2-3 episodes. They didn't really feel like they flowed well."
1,Does NOT fit the Genesis Gold B,"Buried in the specs are the correct dimensions of this product. However if you search the Amazon website for ""flavorizer bars for a Weber Genesis Gold B gas grill"" you will be taken to this product. It may well be wonderful for another grill but it does not fit the Weber Genesis Gold B."
2,Disappointed,Have been taking for about 6 months and recent blood tests shows my cholesterol same as year ago 224. But my Triglycerides went from 129 to 161. SO I will finish out my recent purchase but wont buy again.
5,Actually the newest version of this Bible,"Although the picture shows the old version, this is actually the new version of this Bible (with the handprint angel on the front). I was really glad of that since I was wanting to get the new one. LOVE THIS BIBLE! Super helpful in children's ministry!"
2,The Titanic Survivors 2 Tape Set,"More hype than real substance, but still a little bit more information can be gleaned from these two tapes. It would be nice if it was on one DVD. There is hardly anything [time wise] to these two tapes."
5,Hilarious :),"This book is absolutely charming and very very funny. I laughed, and boy did I need it. :) It helps you laugh at the hard stuff, and be even more grateful for the wonderful things. Perfect gift for a new mom familiar with yoga. :)"
4,Pretty Happy,It is a good microwave. We still have to get used to how fast it heats! The one thing I don't like is the keyboard is not completely explanatory...I have to keep referring to the instruction manual.
4,An engaging story,"I found this to be a very engaging story, with a good mix of local color, historical development and Ethiopian culture. The way it is written raises questions as to how factual all of the content is, but that does not make it any less interesting as a story. The weakest parts are his descriptions of political developments among Ethiopia's leadership, which frequently come across more as off-the-cuff characterizations you might here from someone in a bar rather than true insight. Despite being described on its cover by one reviewer ""a glimpse into hell"", the book does not dwell excessively on the gruesome things the author experienced, and even those do not fill up a great deal of the book, about half of which is devoted to his childhood which overall seems to have been pretty pleasant. This is not to marginalize the terrible things that did happen to him, his family or Ethiopia, the point just being that he does not dwell on them with excessive or graphic detail."
4,Notes from the Hyena's Belly,"Notes from the Hyena's Belly is a memoir that often reads like a novel. It depicts Nega's relatively calm childhood in sharp contrast to the growing unrest, civil strife and government corruption that dominated his adolescence and early adulthood. The book gives insight into a piece of Ethiopia's history, which is peppered with scenes from Nega's growing up years and folk tales that his mother told. Nega successfully speaks to the impact of civil war, government corruption and the too frequent global indifference to such issues in Africa, while at the same time maintaining a wry sense of humor that makes his story all the more human and real. This combination gives it a unique flavor and certainly makes it memorable."
5,Well I love it,It's my soundtrack driving around the panhandle (from Florida to Louisiana.) I know the band is from Cali but the sound is stripped down and it sound matches the environment.I know lots of folks like their blues slicked up or with lots of guitar but that just wouldn't fit.It's great - even though I usually prefer Musselwhite's instrumentals and there are none on this CD.
3,A bit disappointing,"I bought this based on the enthusiastic Amazon reviews and the fact that I like blues rock. This is my first Charlie Musselwhite and I was a bit disappointed. His vocals are laconic and the guitar is rarely gripping. The opening song has a good hook, but the rest is pretty forgettable. If you like blues harp, I'd recommend Kim Wilson's solo efforts over this. Still, it's a solid listenable album, and they may be more vivid in concert."
2,Boring Blues,"I grew up in the South and have loved blues for as long as I can remember. I have always loved Charlie Musselwhite's blues harp as a sideman on many albums in the past. This is the first album by him that I have purchased and by track 3 I could not listen anymore. The lyrics bordered on trite (Women love me 'cause I take my time. Gimme a break!)and the band was nothing special. His harp playing was outstanding as always but produced so it pretty much overwhelmed the other musicians. For me this was a waste of money and I don't say that about much music I buy. If you want some Mississippi Delta blues by a contemporary artist, pick up something by Eden Brent. Based on this CD I will pretty much forgo another recording by this artist."
2,Doesn't grab,"I saw Charlie Musselwhite live years ago and he was superb - the joint was really jumpin'. However I find he's just not the same on CD and perhaps he's even getting worse. There's a couple of good standard blues tracks here, and some energetic playing, but even so it sounds tired and old hat. The electricity isn't there. And of course you can't put the best tracks on to a personal compilation because ratty EMI is into Copy Control big time. Their loss, maybe they'll eventually realise it's working to their detriment. There are many TELARC Blues CDs that are more exciting than this."
4,church is out! Yeeha,worth it for first song. jeff bezos is a clown. can't stop listening to the first song.
4,"It's a total 80s movie, but I love it anyway!","This movie was definitely made in the 80s. Besides the ridiculous fashion statements (although I can't really complain about Peter Dobson in his skintight jeans -- the 80s weren't *all* bad), there are a LOT of confusing and/or random parts to this movie. A cinematic masterpiece it is not. For instance, no matter how many times I watch it, I can't for the life of me figure out how time progresses through the story. It's a complete mystery to me. What this movie is, though, is a touching romance story with some great dancing scenes. I love it just for that -- it's cute, sweet, and inspirational. If you're willing to overlook the discrepancies in the story, you'll really enjoy it for its underlying sweetness and great dance scenes. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who, like me, loves dance movies, movies about plays, or stories about romance."
4,This was great!,"I just love musicals, dramas, or whatever you call this movie. It was fabulous! I can relate to the senior play I had at our school ""The Music Man""!"
5,"This is a fun, uplifting movie!","I watched this movie about 40 times during my high school days. I knew every word to the finale. The story is romantic, and full of action! Also the costumes and set are very well done."
3,Light hearted fare for all,"While the plot is trite, the acting is reminiscent of FAME with good dancing but a lot of lip synched music. Still, it comes together to provide a good blend. The story is about the last 'annual' Brooklyn High School 'SING' musical before the school is closed. Peter Dobson plays the 'Grease'-like bad boy. He finds his match with Elaine Bracco the 'SING' coordinator, a teacher that challenges the dance talent within him, giving him a chance to change his ways. Not a cerebral movie, but good light fare with adequate acting and good music, especially the finale."
2,A real mish mash...,"Believe me there are far better ballet introduction CDs out there. Note that the ""Nutcracker Suite"" only includes excerpts; there is plenty of room for it's entirety. ""Samson and Dalilah"" is either poorly remastered or not at all. Was the Prelude from ""La Traviata"" scored for ballet? If not, whats it doing here? ""Invitation to the Dance"" is the true bright spot on the disc. Just a little buyer's info before you purchase."
2,More money required,"I was disappointed with the book primarily because it depends on you taking a test online (which costs for you and your spouse to both take it) and references are made over and over to the workbook (separate books for husband and wife). Consequently this book seemed more about selling stuff than it did helping communication in the home. Don't spend the money on the book unless you are willing to also buy the workbooks and pay for the test. It would have seemed more ""honest"" to raise the price of the book a little and put the worksheets right in the book. Frankly, the information in the book isn't anything better than something much more reasonable from Norman Wright, Gary Smalley or Gary Chapman."
1,Boring and unrefreshing,"Map Of The World is incredibly boring and uninviting. The story line is a sad one for sure,however, one loses the sense of what is really going on with Alice. It seem to me that the author could not make up her mind as to which main story to stick with. I liked Theresa character and felt her heart warming spirit. Alice and Howard could definitely benefit from parenting classes. Overall, I found the book to be lost in a lot of rambling."
2,Very depressing--not one bit of relief,"I read all the reviews on the book and was looking for a well-written story. It was well written, but I found myself feeling squirmy about reading and that the author was pushing my buttons in an uncomfortable way. Perhaps that was what she intended, but I don't feel enlightened as a result. I also felt the portrayal of farm life over romanticized. I agree that the book made me think of Thousand Acres--rural setting, tragedy, opressive feelings. Finally, I'm not sure I believe in the main character. I certainly don't relate to her."
1,Depressing,"I can honestly say that this book was one of the most depressing books I have ever read. I picked it up last September in a bookstore at the beach; long before Oprah announced it as a club selection. However, it is in keeping with most of Oprah's picks-deep, dark, disturbing. I would not recommend this book and haven't to any of my friends. I had to force myself to finish it; just hoping it would get better-it didn't."
2,"In the tradition of afternoon ""soaps.""","Try to imagine one of the most horrible circumstances in which a young mother can find herself: she is babysitting when a child in her care accidentally drowns. Now try to imagine every conceivable disaster which can result from that one accident. That's what happens in Map of the World. No horrific event is left out. No amount of hand-wringing trauma is enough. No action on the part of the main character can make things ""right."" This is not a novel. It is a soap opera"
5,AWESOME!!!!,This book was amazing. I read it as a school project and i never realized how much a book could effect me. Jane Hamilton is a very talented writer and A Map of the World appeals to so many people. I really enjoyed all the characters and how they grew in this book. For my class we have to write a essay on the book and all the key points. I feel so lucky to have stumbled on this book! I reccomend it for anyone!
3,"So, so depressing","I have a two and a half year son and I started squirming the minute I started to read this book and after about 150 pages put it down and couldn't pick it up again. It is beautifully written but the tragedy is just so oppressive and unrelenting. I just don't see the point of dwelling in such a dark place for so long.Even if someone pointed out that life is often dark and tragic, I would argue that authors like Shakesphere have written tales of heart-rending tragedy that leave the audience in tears but feeling somehow wiser and enobled too. This book just left me feeling like I had gone through an emotional blender with no relief at all."
1,the worst bestseller you'll ever read,"I can't begin to describe how much I hated this book! The language was ""pretty"", but I had to force myself to finish it. A boring mess of a book. The characters were unrealistic. The plot threads were all over the place; some were dropped abruptly never to reappear. What a waste of time. After I finished it I gave this one away to a friend who's loved all the Oprah's book club selections & needed something to read on a long plane trip. Even she hated it - she left it in an airport half finished."
1,Depressing AND Boring - a losing combination,"This is the first book I have ever read where I could not identify with a single character. The protagonist, Alice, is so prickly, self-pitying and unlikable that you find yourself hoping she WILL be convicted. Don't waste your time with this book!"
1,"BORING, SAD, DEPRESSING, Blah blah blah blah blah","I wouldn't give this even one star but one is the lowest you can go. This is my current book that was picked for the book club. I have bad luck reading any oprah books. This read faster than most of the others I have read, but the ones I have read from Oprah picks have this same depressing nothing really happens kind of theme. Our first book read for my book club was ""The Red TEnt"" and that is the best book I have read in a REALLY long time."
1,A revolting concoction.,"This book was terrible. It's horribly constructed, and Hamilton's attempt at 'graceful language' falls flat when wasted on such shallow characters.I have an exam coming up in less than 3 hours, and a good chunk of this exam rests of my ability to successfully write about 'mimetic desire' in relationship to Hamilton's travesty of a novel. How on earth I'm expected to come up with this sort of material, especially with such an intolerable work, is beyond me.Other problems include the storyline 'gracefully' grinding to a complete halt. Following the plot is like watching an old person slip into a coma. As well, I strongly suspect that very few readers have the patience to deal with Hamilton's abominable elements of self-pity and unrelenting stubborness.Oh, god, I could go on forever, but I need to start studying."
1,extremely put-downable,"i rarely leave a book unfinished, and this is definitely one of those rare times. i am glad i got the book for only a quarter at a library book sale. i am ready to take it out and put it anywhere, probably on a park bench when it stops snowing so maybe someone can benefit from it, someone who will sympathize with the book's self-centered and extremely boring characters. i went past page 50, hoping the book would kick in, but it didn't. i should have learned from my first experience with jane hamilton's The Book of Ruth, but i thought i would give this author a second chance. well, this is her last, as far as i am concerned. it is a waste of time for serious readers. use your time, money and effort on the classics. this one is not even worth summarizing."
2,Lifetime!!,"This book was okay. That is all there really is to say. I suspect that this book will eventually turn into a movie and I will catch it on Lifetime. I think this story will be more intriuging as a movie on the Lifetime Network than a as a novel, what with all of those commercial breaks building the suspense!"
2,"Not a deep work; only popular due to ""star power.""","Though usually hesitant to read books on Oprah's list (I believe in my own ability to find a good book, though I admit she has picked some winners), I read a bit of this one at the store and felt I would enjoy it. WRONG. The only character in the book I actually liked and cared about was Theresa, and it was not her story. Though a lot takes place in this novel (death, prison, false accusations) and it reveals life truths (such as the fact that many spouses don't know each other and one's seemingly safe life can snap in one minute, without the slightest hint of forewarning), it left me saying - ""Oh, deal with it."" The novel held no great revelations for me, nor did I find the central characters compelling in any way. Far worse things have ocurred to others not as well situated, and they have conquered their demons with more grace, common sense, and ability. Better novels have told similar tales in more compelling fashion."
2,A slow go.,"While parts of this book kept me turning the pages, on the whole, I was bored to tears. I found Alice to be a pitiful soul, and her husband, Howard, to be a pathetic man. His perspective was the most frustrating. I have found Oprah's picks to be pretty awful so far - Snow Falling on Cedars, is another one that dragged on for what seemed to be an eternity. I honestly am recommending people to avoid this book."
3,A Map of Disappointment,I started reading Ms. Hamilton's work with great anticipation. It held my attention for about the first 100 pages but then I found that the story deteriorated rapidly. Alice's emotional responses following Lizzie's death were very well written. I was disappointed in how the book developed and while I initially was telling all my friends to read the book (during the reading of the first 100 pages) I later recanted my recommendation.
1,Unlikable Characters,"I just don't understand how so many people can love this book so. I felt none of the characters were likable especially Alice. Howard would have been better off without her--I would have been just as happy if she had had to stay in jail. Way too wordy and depressing. As a mother of young children, it didn't bother me at all to read this. It was too lousy even to care about. As for Oprah's picks, I am surprised. Midwives is the only other one of her suggestions I have read, which also left me annoyed with the main character and the story as well. I'll give Oprah one more chance."
5,"It sounds like a cliche , but I could not put it down","I think it is rare to get such a sensitive, emotional picture of anguish . The events pull you along, and the language allows the reader a window through which you view the soul of the narrator.A wonderful choice."
3,A Very Complex Book,"To me, this story represented how an innocent mistake (or was it? ) can change our lives and those around us in a second. Alice was a a very complex character and I went back and forth on is she guilty or is she innocent. She seemed to thrive in prison where she was in awe of the other prisoners and their abilities to spin stories. It was almost like she welcomed any hardship or pain inflicted upon her out of a sense that she deserved it because of Lizzie's death. I was not expecting her marriage to Howard to last, but they stayed to together and both seemed so unhappy at the end of the book. I guess it is coming to terms with life's circumstances and how far from grace they can take us. A very, very descriptive book, but all in all an interesting read. I am surprised they are making a movie of it!"
3,All over the map,"I read this book for a book club, and it ultimately received a high rating. I only gave it three stars because I like books that stay focused. I felt that Map of the World brought me along on so many tangents and memory pieces that I became bored, wanting the plot to move forward instead of back. However, it was well written with clear descriptions."
4,Very engrossing,"I'm not 100% sure ""enjoyed"" is the right word for how I experienced this book. It was hard to put down, and I was emotionally involved with the characters, but along with enjoying the story and the character development I found it frightening. It's so easy to find yourself out in the cold, accused of something you didn't do, or at least finding that your life is completely altered by an event that only took seconds to happen. A bit haunting. I liked seeing the story from both Alice's and Howard's viewpoints."
2,Not for summer reading..,"I read this book for summer reading and I must say it was the longest and most drawn out thing ever. I really did have a hard time actually sitting down and reading it. I even stopped reading in in July, read everything else I had to read, and decided I had to finnish it by today, for school tomorrow. The ending was terrible."
3,Not as eventful as Book of Ruth but still an average read,"Map of the world is somewhat less depressing (but also less eventful) than Hamilton's first book, Book of Ruth. (I gave Book of Ruth a higher rating). Being less eventful, perhaps Map of the World is far more indicative of everyday life. I would have liked a more in-depth look at more of the characters and a little more action, but it is still a good, average read.It is interesting how the author develops the farm as a peacemaking character all its own. The farm, providing comfort and stability, was a strong root for all of members of the Goodwin family. Anyone who has moved from the country to the city (as I have) will identify with the nostalgic hold countrylife can have on a person's spirit.If you liked the country family saga of Map of the World, don't miss Book of Ruth also by Jane Hamilton or Mercy Road by Dalia Pagani."
1,What a bummer!,"What is with Oprah? I have read five of her books now, each one more depressing than the previous. This book was boring and had too many words. I felt like the elementary school situation was unrealistic (I am a teacher) and the behavior of the children would never have happened as written. I did not like Alice and wished Howard and Theresa would ride off into the sunset and leave her with her rambling thoughts. I ended up skipping entire pages of descriptions and thoughts just to get to the storyline so I could finish. It's back to Harry Potter for me. Now that's real action!"
2,Extremely slow,"It took me longer than usual to read this book. I felt the writer had some mixed thoughts and put them down on paper. I was always looking for something good to happen and it wasn't til the end that I realized I just read a bomb. try the Pilots Wife, or river, Cross My Heart or even Vinegar Hill was better than this."
3,my review,"I found it very hard to read this book. I know life sometimes is hard on someone, but this is taking it to the extreme. I tried to empathize with the main character, Alice, especially after she suffered the drowning of her neighbor's daughter, but I could not accept her reaction and even less the incredible turn around she goes through once she is imprisoned.Maybe this means this author is very good to create such reaction in me? But I thought the aim of reading was to enjoy oneself and it did not happen for me here.All that happened in this book to one person, could have filled three books."
1,"Too bad, a waste of time","This book was painful to read, not because of the subject matter, but because of the long, drawn-out way in which it was written. In my opinion, this book could have told the same story in perhaps a third of the pages.If you like reading about people who overly agonize and emotionalize, then this is for you.If not, skip it."
2,a great book,"I thought this was a great book and couldn't put it down! If I just looked at the title or cover, I wouldn't have read it!"
5,thoroughly engrossing,"I was hesitant to pick this book after reading some reader reviews describing it as boring, too wordy, and turned off by the death of a child.On the contrary, I found it very rich, textural, and complex in a very human way. I was never bored and whipped through this in less than a week. I found it fascinating. I loved the way Alice narrated it at first, then Howard, than back to Alice again.People are very fallible, complex characters and this book finds the perfect pitch to tell that story. It is about surviving trageday, and ultimately, forgiveness.While this is not a ""happy"" read, I was not depressed by it either. I get so tired of people complaining about subject matter being depressing and therefore, throwaway. It is through pain we often find joy. For me, a good book, or movie is something that grips me and holds my attention, whether it be happy or sad or both.This is one of the better books I have read in a long time. I will read more by Jane Hamilton."
1,"Please, put the dysfunctional family to rest","Having to reread MAP OF THE WORLD a second time in 3 years for my book discussion group (I am a librarian and discussion leader) gave me an opportunity to get really annoyed all over again. Why would anyone care about this two self-absorbed , sullen characters that can't communicate with each other let alone the reader. Alice likes to tromp around doing Hungarian dances while Howard milks the cows? Give me a break! When will contemporary authors quit beating the dead and boring horse of dysfunctional families and write something beyond their own personal experience. Write about something you don't know - do some research!"
3,Worth Reading,"I enjoyed this book even though it was so sad. I do not feel that anything was resolved by the end of the novel. In fact, I believe that things will never be resolved for these characters. It is so true to life -- you pay the consequences for your actions, good and bad, and you just have to deal with it and go on. I think Alice, Howard, Theresa, Emma and Claire will all pay the price for the rest of their lives. You can never go home because home doesn't exist as it did before. The book is so well-written, however, from a different perspective than most fiction. The story is told subjectively through the eyes of Alice and Howard, rather than objectively. It's not a book that moves along quickly from one event to the next. It's more about the feelings and emotions of the characters. As you read the story, you feel as though you are going through the events through the eyes of the characters."
3,Challenging Topography,"Jane Hamilton is a writer who can articulate the complex peaks and valleys of internal chaos. She does so in the rugged terrain of external tragedy. Yes, internal and external drama make up this map of the world. We learn the geography of the protagonist Claire who is a mother of two and seems to attract tragedy. Claire is believable, honest, vulnerable, and introspective. If you enjoyed and endured the pain and trama of Beth in Jacquelyn Mitchard's ""The Deep End of the Ocean,"" then you will get a great deal out of this book. What I liked best about ""A Map of the World"" is that it offered a second perspective on the external situations and internal conflicts as the second part of the book shifts to Claire's husband Howard as the voice with which the story continues. While it is a sad story, and not something to read if you are suffering from depression, it is nice to be able to look at your own life and realize ""things aren't really that bad."""
1,This is an Oprah choice?,This was one of the worst books that I have ever read. How did it come to be on Oprah's list. Does she actually read any of the books on her list? If I could have selected less than 1 star I would have.
1,Skip this one!,"My daughter read this book and sent her copy to me stating that she wasn't sure I'd like it much but it passed the time for her while she rode the subway to work. Wow, what a chore it was to get through it! The characters were not well developed, the plot ordinary, and the story slow and boring. I was not surprised that it did not hold my interest as it is one of Oprah's and I have been very disappointed in the other two I've read, Stone's From the River and Songs in Ordinary Time. Skip this one!"
3,Intriguing & depressing,I like this author's writing style. Easy to read and get a feel for characters and their environment. This book in particular starts out very interesting and intriguing but then drags on a bit and keeps leading you downhill. I read it rather quickly hoping it would pick up again. Seems believable maybe that's why it's depressing. Not a bad read but wouldn't highly recommend.
2,Depressing,"The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one was due to the courtroom scenes. They were the only interesting part of the book. I found this novel depressing and had no sympathy whatsoever for the main character. She was a caustic, careless individual who had an attitude. I also found the character Theresa to be very unrealistic. I suppose there are genuine saintly people out there who could forgive what the main character did to her child, but her ""goodness"" was nauseating. Don't waste your time on this."
2,can't seem to get interested...,"I'm not actually done reading the book, & it upsets me. I find myself struggling to read a single page! After coercing myself to read 5 pages, I'd have to put the book down...then force myself to pick it up again maybe 2 days later & do the same thing all over again. I""ve never had this problem before!I do believe that once I get done reading the book, the story will be a good one---that's why I""m so upset that I can't get myself to be interested in it by now! Then again, I also fear that maybe everybody is giving this book so much praise merely because the ""overall story"" is a good one, while at the same time, it's a bad read. Seems to me, & this is the first time I've ever said this, that this story is probably more enjoyable as a movie then as a book."
4,I felt like they were real,"This book was written with such realism and such emotion, that I felt like the characters were real. It is amazing how a person can feel alone when they are surrounded by people. Jane Hamilton weaves her characters into a realistic, heart-wrenching, and encompassing story that you can't put down."
3,Good book,"I liked the book, especially her descriptions about the interrelationships between the characters, but I must agree with one reviewer who wrote that we never do understand Alice. She's written as eccentric, but it is frustrating trying to wade through her seemingly crazy dialogue. The story is sad and painful, but it will make you apprecieate that your map of the world sometimes gets flushed down the toilet when things happen which are out of your control. I found it hard to put down about half way through."
2,"STIFFLING, SUFFOCATING, GIMME AIR, QUICK!","If you liked Smiley's 1000 Acres, you'll like this book. I liked neither. I felt in both books like I was going through someone's dirty laundry basket ... there was nothing uplifting...nothing to capture the imagination. The ""heroine"" of A Map of the World was truly unlikable to me. She was self-absorbed and not anyone I could care about. Her children were despicable, and her husband a tight-lipped drone. The only reason I give the book even 3 points is that it opens with a bang. The action that gets the whole story in motion happens more quickly than in any other novel I have read. Perhaps that's why the rest of the book seems so slow and tedious. I might add, If you like books with a little ""poetry"" in them, or books that leave something to the imagination (such as The God of Small Things), skip this one. Everything's laid out in tedious and unending detail."
2,A Map of the World,Buy this book only if you want to feel sad and depressed. This book is yet another pathetically sad book in Oprah's book club!
1,Sinclair Lewis meets Oprah,"This novel is really just an 'Oprahization' of the tradition of Babbitt, Main Street and Elmer Gantry--it's fundamentally a screed against the smothering hypocrisy of a midwestern town that fails to understand its most hip, sensitive residents. Frankly, Jane, it's been done, and without resorting to the emotionally manipulative story and characters you've concocted here.As several reviewers have mentioned, Hamilton is capable self-absorbed characters bring this book down, especially Alice's tedious expositions of just how *remarkably* sorry she is for herself.Also, the devices Hamilton uses to prove how her bohemian family stands out from the hoi polloi in that heartless (and obviously soul-less) Wisconsin backwater are both tiresome and ridiculous. The farm as an island of Eden in the subdivisions? Mommy's folk dances in the attic? Daddy's clarinet serenades to grieving, confused daughters? This stuff is fodder for the Simpsons!"
1,Who are these depressing people!,"I could only manage to read about 1/3 of this thoroughly depressing novel before I gave myself the permission to put it down and stop torturing myself. I felt no compassion for any of the characters except Theresa. The plot is rather contrived (accidental drowning, charges of sexual abuse, arrest - talk about bad karma!) and I felt that I really didn't care what Alice had to say or what happened to her. Some of the other reader reviews were glowing; guess it goes to show you that people do have wildly different tastes when it comes to literature. I will not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Too wordy,This book starts out slow and is difficult to get into. The last chapters are the best but too bad you have to read the others first.
4,Compelling Read,"How many times have we made big mistake, or a costly error, and just wished that we could turn back the clock five or ten minutes to undo the mistake? Multiply that feeling - that desire - millions of time and you can begin to imagine how Alice feels when struck with this horrible tragedy. It's something that could really happen to any one of us, and this book brings that possibility to the foreground.I was intrigued by and enjoyed the way the chapters are narrated by varying characters. That unique method of story-telling provides the reader with special insiqht into the thoughts and feelings of each character, and how they're feeling about and dealing with this tragedy in their own minds.I definitely recommend this one."
3,"Accidental Death, False Accusation, Small-town Life","This books appears to have quite a bit going on, but the reading is a little slow going.""A Map of the World"" is a novel about a city family who now lives on a farm in a small town. The ""heroine"" of the novel, the mother, is present when an accidental death occurs for which few forgive her. She is then falsely accused by the small-town folks for unspeakable crimes and jailed.The plot is interesting, but as I said, the reading is slow going. The characters either develop very slowly, or their depth is so shallow that I didn't realize they were already developed. With so much going on and so much plot, it is hard to imagine not caring about how it turns out.I enjoyed ""Book of Ruth"" much, much more."
5,"Great book, wasn't thrilled about the ending though.","I had read Jane Hamilton's first book, The Book of Ruth, and loved it so much I thought I needed to read this book which got great reviews! I honesly couldn't put this book down. It's amazing that one ""average"" person's life can be turned upside down by one accident. I thought Howard was going to tell Alice about Theresa at the very end because he seemed to be not acting himself. I was kinda surprised that didn't happen but other then that I loved it and recommend it."
2,a bit wobbly,"I found the main characters Alice and Howard a bit wobbly. I didn't end up feeling like I knew them at all. I felt like they were sleepwalking through their whole lives. I don't hold out much hope for them. In short, the tale was not very interesting or believable. I didn't relate to it at all."
3,A little too much estrogen for me,"Good book-but too much of a ""chick"" book for me. I normally tend toward the political, murder, spy sort of books, so this was a big change. It as an Oprah book club book and it is obvious why-the author spends an entire page describing how one character enjoys the Oprah show."
1,Left me empty...,"Like the Wisconsin reader and the reader from Mill Valley, Hamilton's book left me feeling very empty and disappointed. I also had no real feelings for the main character and found myself not caring one way or the other what happened to her. I was very disappointed with this book and felt bored and fretful throughout, waiting for something substantial to happen."
1,Yawner,BORING! I liked the opening paragraph and that's it. The author failed to draw me in. I ended up reading just the beginning and the end and skimming the rest. The author most definitely is not a very good storyteller. Save your money.
2,great cure for insomnia,"This book fell short on so many levels. There is this great potential for a wonderful story, but it just never quite gets there; it's as if emotion is missing from it. It's complicated because I found the book interesting, but it was just boring. The story is there, it is well written, but something is missing.It's too bad whomever wrote the intro on the dust jacket didn't write the book, they had me sold on an interesting tale. I can usually plow through a book, even a slow book, at a good clip but I stopped reading this one about 6ish chapters from the end. I couldn't even bring myself to find out what happens in the end...I really couldn't care less. I don't normally write reviews on Amazon, I like people to form their own opinions, but I felt the need to get it out there...don't waste your time on this one!"
1,Not so much,"Depressing, bleak, sorrowful.I don't know why I even picked up this book - oh yeah, it was .50 at a yard sale - it wasn't even worth that!"
2,Unable to Connect...,"with this book. It never grabbed me. Some books get to me immediately, this one I had a tough time connecting with. So much so, that I rented the video to see if I was missing something. To which I found that I wasn't."
3,Know better now.,"I am amazed that one review recommended this book to anyone 13 and older. Of all of the wonderful literature today and throughout the ages, why would you suggest this. Granted, I am always amazed at the subtle changes in one's life that can wreak havoc on the future, this book is just not that great. Nice writing style but I wouldn't read it had I known better."
1,Unable to finish this book.,"I purchased ""Map of the World"" about 3 weeks ago ready to sink into another ""Oprah's Book Club"" recommendation. I've loved the last few I read, ""Home Is Where The Heart Is"", ""The Pilots Wife"", ""She's Come Undone"", but I am very disappointed in this book. I've picked it up serveral times only to feel very disconnected with the story and I lay it back down. I've caught myself actually day dreaming while reading, unsure of what I read. Her style of writing seems too wordy and difficult to follow. I've yet to be struck with the excitement of being unable to put this book down. After my third attempt I've decided that this book is just not for me."
2,"Very, very depressing","I attempted to read this book-Jane Hamilton is an excellent writer but this is a profoundly depressing book and I caution readers to avoid it unless they really want to give it a shot.(Don't let Oprah's recommendation sway you-(See Bridges of Madison County- an apalling book- read the reviews for a laugh- her choices are generally very weak) Jane Hamilton is a better author than most on Oprah's list. I was unable to finish this and felt drained & depressed which is unusual with me because I am really a happy person. Actually, my husband asked me to stop reading it!"
3,Hard book to get into,Was really hard getting into the book. Found that I had to force myself to read the last part of it.
1,Monotone at best,"This book is painful slow, depressing. Im not sure how it made the list. Its just painfullyslow every chapter is about her pain. Enough, I really tried to keep reading but decided to just put it down half way through and end my pain..."
3,Strange....but good,"I found that A Map of the World kept me coming back for more. The emotions in this book are so well described, at times they are even raw. A book about the power of womens friendship and all it can and will endure."
2,Disappointing,"Jane Hamilton's books are certainly memorable. ""Book of Ruth"" contained one of those scenes which will remain burned into my brain cells. However, ""Map of the World"" seems to have all the cynicism and darkness, with none of the intensity or sense of redemption. Characterization seemed weak - I couldn't muster enough interest about the characters to really care what happened to them. I'm surprised this is an Oprah pick."
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"I fell in love with The Book of Ruth and expected this book by Hamilton to reinforce my love of this writer. However, it took me two months to get through a book that it should have only taken me a week to read. I found it boring, with no direction. The best part of the book, I feel, was the section from Howard's point of view. The rest left much to be desired. I was disappointed today when I saw that Oprah had chosen this book."
1,"Way too wordy, and difficult to get absorbed...","I put this book down after reading almost 100 pages of it. It takes a lot for me to put a book down! The descriptions were WAY TOO WORDY - the author often uses almost an entire page to describe a simple emotion. While I found the plot an interesting one (from previous reviews), I think the book could have been written in quite a few less pages. After 100 pages, I was not absorbed into the book, and was still struggling to continue reading. That's when it wasn't worth my time anymore."
2,lost grip,"Great premise for a gripping story, but I couldn't suspendmydisbelief of the events that followed the initial tragidy. One's sense of depression would be fathomable after such an event, but I thought a mother's bond to her own children would override any guilt ridding penance in prison ... The court scene near the end was unsatisfying in that the witnesses seemed tailormade for the result."
1,"Slow, slow, slow","I was anxiouse to start this book because of the great review. I struggled to stay with it, not really caring one way or the other what happened to the characters. If it wasn't the only book I brought with me on vacation, I may never have finished it at all."
3,The Novel as Cudgel,"With a surgeon's precision Hamilton shows how rapidly one awful event leads to the next awful event, causing lives to unravel. Sometimes the intensity of the author's vision, her anxiety to have the reader see what she sees, made this reader feel yanked out of the story and beaten about the head."
4,Very Insightful story!,"I absolutely loved this book by Jane Hamilton. She wrote it with plenty of laughter, tears and insightfulness on a very touchy subject...child abuse. I adored her characters, namely Alice, Theresa Howard, even Nellie! I have recommended this book as well as her first one, to my sisters bookclub and several reader friends. I give Jane Hamilton a thumbs up! GO GIRL!"
4,A Fine Novel,The sense of place is wonderful in this novel and the characters well-defined. Certainly Hamilton is adept at her craft and will leave most readers quite pleased.
1,Boring,"I slogged through this book only because it is my principle that I finish any book that I start. I did not find any of the characters interesting or compelling. I was actually hoping that Alice was found guilty so everyone could get on with their lives, such as they were. I believe that I will give up on Oprah's picks because they are all about such boring people (This Much I Know is True; Stella)"
1,"""Among the major writers of our times.."" ha, ha, ha","Again, I fell for the mark ""Oprah's Book Club"". One star is one too many. Drudging through A MAP OF THE WORLD was a waste of time. What a misguiding title! Actually, I was gleeful when the main character was thrown into prison without bail, because she was so self-centered, self-absorbed, and aggravating, that she deserved it. To find out she was innocent was disappointing and all the details in this book are quite unrelated, unreal and dreadfully boring. The trial is totally unbelievable; the author dreamed up a form of justice not likely to be practised in this universe; the entire story could be told on 15 pages easily, and nobody would finish reading them..."
4,Of Love and Other Demons,"Set in the tropical South America during the 1700s, Marquez writes of the fateful love affair between a young girl and a priest. Sierva Maria, who was made to live in the slave quarters until the age of twelve, is bitten by a rabid dog one day, and is consequently forced to undergo uncivil, tormenting therapy. Maria is soon sent to a convent when the local Bishop states his belief that Maria is possessed. It is at this convent where she encounters Father Cayetano Delaura, who wil be deciding on whether or not Maria needs to be exorcised. From this point on, Delaura begins to realize the strong feelings that he feels for Sierva Maria. Marquez powerfully demonstrates the unfortunate sequence of events that can come from one incident, and from one ill-fated love affair. I stronly reccomend this book. Enjoy! :-D"
1,Depressing!,"God knows how or why I ever finished this book. It must have been a bad week for finding good books.The subject matter was depressing, and throughout the entire book the story just seemed too fantastical and didn't ring true.Frankly, since this book made Oprah's book club, I have refused to read anything else that did. It just left a bad taste in my mouth."
3,"I love ""The book of Ruth"". but Map disappointed me","I picked up this book with great expectaions. I loved Jane Hamilton's other book: ""the Book of Ruth"". However i wa disapointd by this one. The chracters were well developed, but the story sagged in the middle. Over all, even the prose was a bit tired. Ms. Hamilton fell into cliches. Too bad."
2,Hapless people make for fruitless reading,"I looked forward to reading this book, having heard so many good things about it. However, I found the characters disturbingly self-involved and even rather stupid about the way life works. Alice doesn't lift a finger to help herself, before or after her tragedies; she is a drifter. She ""forgives"" her husband -- but I don't know for what. The jail scenes were very false, and the black dialect was off-key (i.e., ""I be listening"" means I'm listening all the time. ""I listening"" would mean I'm listening right now.) Hamilton says her point is all about forgiveness -- but it is Theresa who has something to forgive. Alice brought her troubles on herself. I am a teacher and there ARE annoying children, and you can lose your temper. But you make it up to the child later, even apologize! You don't go on resenting the kid. He's a KID! A very odd book, and very disappointing."
1,Depressing book,"I wanted to read the book, even purchased it after it became an ""Oprah"" pick. I was very disappointed in it. I did read it all, kept hoping it would get better! I didn't like the characters. Actually I thought the book just drug along. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
2,Disappointing,I am pretty confident the only reason this one made Oprah's picks is because she is mentioned in the book.
2,A tiring read..,"This is extremely difficult reading. I found myself skimmingover many paragraphs and pages, just looking for some dialogue. Tomake it worse, the print in this edition is so small that one can only read for a chapter or so before becoming fatigued. I found it annoying, and way too wordy and explanatory. I think if they got to the point more quickly, and didn't labor so MUCH over descriptions etc. it would have been more enjoyable. It's become a drudgery to read, rather than a passtime."
1,A Map Of The World,"While the author is a wonderful writer, I had a real hard time getting through this book. I absolutly had no pity for the main character, in fact her self-absorbtion in herself was sickning. I don't have to identify with characters in order to love a book, however I felt so far removed from this woman that I could hardly finish. Definetly not a page turner."
2,"Brilliant writing style, but dry predictable plot",Ms. Hamilton's amazing ability to turn a phrase and weave eloquent prose is the only thing that saved this novel. The plot is highly predictable and I never developed any real affinity for either of the narrating characters. The Alice character is quite possibly psychotic and I did not feel the sympathy for her that I believe was intented. I was never entirely convinced that she was not guilty of the crime of which she was accused.
1,Bad Choice - Oprah,I tried to read this book about a month ago and couldn't get past the first 4 chapters. I am surprised that this made Oprah's list. Kinda makes me want to finish it but I'd really hate to invest the time and the book turns out to be a dud. Although Hamilton is one of my favorite writers this novel just didn't work for me. For a better view of Hamilton's talents check out The Book of Ruth or The Short History of a Prince. Both excellent reads.
4,Quietly Sad,"Jane Hamilton outdid herself again. I really enjoyed the descriptive emotions that she displayed on the main character, Alice. I enjoyed the way she explained the way that Howard (her husband) as well as Alice felt about the situations they encountered while on this earth. It was a great READ!!"
5,"Honest, telling and worth reading",I really enjoyed this book and do recommend it to others. The characters allow you to look within yourself and challenge your own feelings about the world. The characters pull you in to their world and put a twist on what is real and what is not. Good book and worth the read.
2,A disappointment,"After Book of Ruth, I was expecting something big from Jane Hamilton. Maybe I was expecting too much. However, I was very disappointed in Map of the World. I couldn't get interested in the characters or their lives, even when things went so bad for them. Also, there was no redemption arising from tragedy, so the whole thing is just depressing."
5,Climbing in to the Heart of an American,"I have never before read a novel that left me feeling as raw. As the story unfolded it felt so real and compelling that I found the feelings of dismay spill out in to my real life. Profoundly horrifying, the plot gets to the heart of a issue as outrageous as the Salem witch trials, but largely ignored by media and ranting law enforcement, church leaders and parents in today's America. Cases like Dale Akiki in San Diego and the Kelly case in Edenton, South Carolina, prove that what happens to the family in A Map of the World is exactly what could happen to anyone in our country.The amazing thing about this novel, however, is that the powerful plot is almost eclipsed by the beauty of the telling. I read some paragraphs several times, marveling at the prose. Add that to an accurate take on the private thoughts a crisis can evoke, and you approach genious. Bravo"
4,startling. a great read.,"This book is really about the fleeting nature of happiness andhow circumstance can interrupt the ordinary flow of a life,altering it forever, simply by chance. The woman in this storyis essentially powerless in the face of an accident and hercommunity's reaction to her role in the tragedy is what destroysthe family life she coveted. It is painful to watch and take partin. This woman is left with no resources and one begins towonder why she cares to continue. I agree, this book is tough totake if you are experiencing a depression in your life."
2,DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN,This book was both depressing and boring. Why people enjoy reading about dying children baffles me.
1,"God, I hated this book","It's rare that I come across a story where I could care less about any of the characters but Jane Hamilton's rambling, aimless prose actually managed to do just that. To sum up: I hated this book. I just couldn't get into it; could not relate to or identify with any of the self-absorbed, passive, boring, unsympathetic characters. But I continued to trudge on---hoping that it'll 'kick in' eventually. But ""A Map of the World"" never took off. It took me over a month to finish reading it. And when I did finally finish, it was more of a relief to finally be done with it than of any literary satisfaction. This book was a huge waste of time. This will be my first and last experience reading Jane Hamilton. ..."
1,An effective sleeping aid,"Every time I tried to read this book, I fell asleep. That's how compelling the plot is. The beginning was promising, but the storyline slid downhill from there. I was very disappointed and surprised that Oprah even recommended such a droll piece of verbiage."
2,reader,Well This book was very very hard to continue reading. The first 100 pages are so slow and you are just like why am I even trying to finish. but I must say that after the first 100 to 150 pages I actually began to get interested in the book. It took me a month to finish. Not one I would reccomend to anyone. I gave it two stars cause I did finish it.
2,I just couldn't sympathize....,"I rated this book with two stars because I really disliked the main character. Perhaps what I seek from reading is different from other readers, but the reasons I read are to be inspired, and to learn, and to laugh. Alice made me angry. She was short sighted, insensitive, weak and self-centered. The reason I didn't rate this book even lower is because, while I disliked it the whole time I was reading it, it certainly made an impression on me. I guess you could say I did learn something from it - how I never want to be. To me, there are too many depressing things that happen in everyday life; I don't want to be depressed in my reading-fantasy world as well."
2,One of only 2 books I actually couldn't get through....,"I found this book so slow, so dull and so shamelessly heart-wrenching that I never did finish it. Who knows, maybe it was the time of year I was reading it in, or maybe something interesting happened 2 pages from where I stopped, but I just could not even feign interest. Uninspirational work by and for those who don't have enough misery in their lives."
2,MaryAnn,"I have been reading this book for a few weeks. The reason it is taking so long is that I read other books in between because I find this one SO BORING! The story is somewhat interesting, characters are OK, but it just goes on and on and on when describing things, feelings, etc. I am going to finish it just because I am interested to find out how it turns out and I am hoping for an ending that will be worth my trouble."
1,Total Waste of My Precious Reading Time!,"Actually, NO STARS IS BEST SAID! This is a case where the author ""tries"" to hard to WRITE! It is overdone with excessive meaningless detail that dragged the plotless story further! I did read ""Book of Ruth"" and enjoyed it, but this, Map of Nowhere was totally boring, nothing happening, nothing doing! Characters aren't profound or defined, and the book takes too long to get to one point! I could read pages and pages and still not have a good grasp of characters or story! Waste of my precious reading time, repeat, a TOTAL waste of my precious reading time!"
1,Gaseous!,"I recently read that a truly good book will entertain and bring about insight for the reader. This book is about as far away from being good by that definition as any book I have read. Languid storytelling, scrawny plot, underdeveloped characters,and an agonizingly slow pace just begins to sum up my response to this book. Hamilton's writing style failed to elicit from me a connection to any of the characters, and events seemed to happen exclusive of others. I hated it."
2,Boring,"This book was mediocre at best! I read the whole book because I kept waiting for something to happen. The book was very flat. I felt like saying get to the good stuff already! But ""the good stuff"" never materialized. I thought that Hamilton's first book was much better."
4,Like a True Story,"This book is a lovely novel. You feel as if everything just happend to those people. Jane Hamilton writes it so insightfully with so much details on human nature, events in life you forget it is a fiction. Wonderful reading on those of us who were not exposed to life in a farm and in a little town. Some chapters were boring at times due to their length without much of happening but the others were quite dramatic, specially the part by Howard about his life in the farm while his wife is in jail. This is my best part, how a dad will try to survive with kids without a mother, very naturally written, smoothly flowing story. The best thing I liked overall was how natural the author writes about day to day events. There is no hyperbole, no suprises or grand sensual scenes but full of delicate events as they unfold each. One of the best reading pleasures I have had."
3,"Boring, boring, boring...","As a teacher, the subject of this book had a lot of potential. It is terrifying to think how one's life could fall apart so quickly because of the accusation of an angry child. However, this book was so boring I almost had to stop reading it on several occasions. If you are looking for a good read by Hamilton, try The Book of Ruth. It will not let you down."
2,Couldn't Hold My Attention,"This book has beautiful descriptions, I often rate a book based on how well it allows me to paint a picture mentally, and I could do it with this novel -- to a point. After a while, all of the story lines got mixed up and I went cross-eyed. I finished it out of necessity, not desire."
3,"Sometimes slow, but beautifully written","Although it got off to a slow start, the prose was so gorgeous I couldn't put it down. After reaching the second section, I was completely hooked. This book was eerie in how realistic it was. A fascinating piece of work with prose to make it stand the test of time. Read this book if you have writer's block, it'll help you distill words write even without inspiration for story."
3,Could have been so much more,"I don't like to criticize but in this case I must. The book had so much more potential than the author provided to readers. I would liked to have read more intrinsic qualities about each main character and not so much of superficial distended judicial rhetoric. Howard seemed an empty shell of a man, Alice a lost victim, and Theresa, although not begrudging of Alice, showed more compassion for Howard's attraction to her than her own sorrow of losing a precious daughter."
3,And I thought the kids on Party of Five had problems!,"If you don't mind being depressed then this is the book for you! Is it well written? Yes. Is it interesting? yes. Are the characters interesting? yes. But, I can't say that this is an enjoyable read."
3,lost momemtum,At first the drama is exciting and well written but began to fall apart with one hopeless event after another which made the plot seemingly unrealistic. I would have rather the author take more time to do character analyisis and court proceedings. Found the ideas somewhat choppy throughout and predictive.
2,GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT,"The only successful thing about this book is that it proves thenew trend in America that you are ""guilty until proveninnocent"" as opposed to ""innocent until proven guilty."" Other than that, I found it boring, boring, boring. Oprah must have a personal friendship with Hamilton since she's picked two of her books for her book of the month club. I didn't like the first pick, Book of Ruth either so I probably should have just let this one go. Instead I ploughed through 390 pages of characters who are all victims with the saddest victim being the husband Howard. I think I'll pass if Oprah picks another Hamilton book. END"
2,Boring,"This was one of the worst books that I have read in a long time. I had to force myself to keep reading in order to finish. The best part was in the middle when the story was told by Howard. The pace seemed to speed up somewhat. In addition, I found that the detail of this book was very distracting and a little too detailed."
4,Map of the World,"The book is well written as it is very descriptive if you like personalities. You feel for each character. However, it is a depressing book. The plot is full of sadness. Sometimes you can't put the book down but on the other hand very slow reading. I really don't know if I liked the book or not.??!!"
3,kinda boring,"The two characters that I can't stand is Theresa and Howard. I mean, they should just get together and divorce their spouses or don't ever start in the first place. Reading about their affair is a pain and it is frustrating. Besides they made it seem as though it was alright. The author made Theresa seem like a goody-two-shoes with no interesting personality. Alice was boring in the beginning and it seems like she went under a sudden personality change when she was arrested. Anyhow, I like her later personality and she was a better character then Howard or Theresa. The book overall is not the type of book I would read if my teacher had not assigned it."
1,Grueling,"This book was so painful to read. The plot is sad and depressing and never gets better. The entire book carries an aura of ""just can't win"" and has no happy or redeeming moments. I had to make myself finish it and by the time I got to the end, I was sorry that I even bothered."
3,"A good story, but way tooooo long","Jane Hamilton is an excellent writer, and she creates wonderful and plausible stories. But she suffers from logorrhea, an excess of verbiage. A skilled editor with both pruning shears and manicure scissors would have greatly improved this book. There were long passages that I skimmed.Don't let this keep you from reading the book. It's good. But you don't have to read every single word, not by a long shot."
5,Changed my Life,"Okay, so the book is a bit contrived and not Shakespeare. However, not a day goes by I don't think about this novel. I read it nearly two years ago and I am still haunted by its realism. As a teacher, I can so clearly see how one woman could find herself accused and go crazy because of the false accusation. Nobody knows what goes on behind our closed doors. I teach Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"" and each time I read it, Hamilton's novel comes to mind. If you haven't read this novel yet, but it, borrow it, do whatever you have to do today."
1,A page turner...but only to end the book quickly!,I read the book and was very bored with it. The best parts really to me were the conversations in jail. I thought more would come of the affair between Howard and the neighbor Theresa. I also thought the book was leading to showing how the Mom really disliked her daughter. I just found it boring. I found it too predictable. I read it through so I wouldn't feel I wasted money. I only wasted my time.
1,depressing,"This is the slowest, most depressing book I've read in a long time. I kept waiting for it to get good and it never did."
1,No Empathy,"This book left me cold. I had no empathy for the main character, who seemed to only want to feel sorry for herself. As the mother of a three year old, I wanted to feel...SOMETHING! But the characters did not warrant any feeling. They were stereotypical and sterile, and the situations seemed completely contrived. Not an enjoyable, or even thought-provoking, read."
3,Slow at first...,"I had an extremely hard time getting into the book and I usually give up if that happens. But, even though this was not one of the best reads I've had, I wanted to finish it to see what would happen. But, that is the only reason I finished it. The Book of Ruth was much better."
3,"Good, but not exceptional","This book starts off as a real page turner and tear jerker. The middle drags a bit and the ending just kinda hangs out there in a way that makes no false attempts at a ""happily ever after"" but doesn't provide full closer either. Overall, it's a pretty compelling story of how one family's life can be turned upside down by tragedy and false accusations. The writing is good and Hamilton has a way of really getting inside her characters heads. I especially like how she switched the narrator midstream and then back again to get different perspectives and maintain continuity."
2,I'm also struggling to finish this book,I agree with the reader from New Jersey. I'm still reading the book and I'm having a hard time getting interested also. I usually read a book within a couple of days and I'm struggling with this one. It's written in a very boring manner.
2,Map of the World,"I felt there was too much. Just when there was a chance to see a situation in depth, more plot was added - always worse. After awhile the book began to feel like a bad ride in the house of horrors. Good writing. Basically, a good short story that did not need so many plot twists."
5,A very moving account,"Thank you, Raymond Arroyo (and all those who helped him), for writing this wonderful biography of the much loved Mother Angelica and narrating the story with such sincerity. I laughed, I cheered, I cried ... Few books cause one to do that. Her story needed to be told to remind us all of the powerful love of God, His will to do miracles for our salvation, and the astonishing things that can happend when we step aside and let Him work through us, weak and miserable as we are."
5,Mother Angelica Biography,"Although I've been watching EWTN (The Catholic TV network founded my Mother Angelica) for many years, the book revealed events in Mother's life I did not know before. Also, the book explained several facts dealing with the conflicts EWTN has had over the years with the Catholic Bishops. This is an entertaining and informative book. Every practicing Catholic should read it."
5,See what Trust in God can do in just one life...,"If you want to see what radical love of God can do in a life - this is the book to read. It does not matter if you are Catholic, Orthodox, or of any Christian denomination - this book is a road map of how to ""work for God.""The book is written by someone who not only loves her, but acknowledges her faults - and just like all of us, she has many. This is a REAL living breathing human being who encounters the same difficulties we all face. The same emotions, hurts, fears, ailments. And yet, maybe it is because of all this that she could talk to anyone (rich man, poor man, beggar, thief) and help them to see that life is never hopeless.You'll need to be careful though, one reading of this book will have you pondering a big question -- ""Do I really trust God enough to find out his will, and do it?""I highly, highly recommend this book."
2,Disappointing in Ways,"In many ways, the book is what Mother Angelica requested of Raymond Arroyo: tell it like it is. It is unvarnished, to a certain degree, but also quite biased. It is difficult to get behind Mother, despite her great accomplishments, when she was continually disobedient to Bishops. All of them were not perfect, that is true, but in general, she did what she wanted and quite often didn't feel called to obedience and that is a disappointment."
4,AWESOME GOD!!!,A down to earth story of a struggling nun who built the empire of network and enables viewers to be touched by the goodness and love of Christ.
1,Raymond Arroyo,"I am not recommending this book. The author emphasizes so much on the problems inside the Catholic Church and misses to write about the beauty and unity of the Church. For all the non-Catholics who decide to read this book: Going through all that this Church has gone through, is another testimony that this is the Church Christ established and He is taking care of it."
2,Mother: the arbiter of our faith?,"The book is very subjective. Arroyo is one of her admirers and could have been more objective. I think the bishops are vilified to a great extent by both Arroyo and Mother. She seemed to have her agenda come hell or high water, no matter what the bishops say. I think the book would lead one to think this is a Catholic network. I would say it is in the Catholic tradition but does not speak for universal Catholicism."
5,Great book at great price and shipping,Bought several of these to sell in a small church bookstore and these were great a deal and were mailed at a great price.
5,"Mother Angelica: The Remarkable Story of a Nun, Her Nerve and Her Network of Miracles",This book is a remarkable story of a woman who beat all the odds of success. It is a book of a wonderful and proud nun. It brought tears and laughter to my heart. This is a beautiful book which I will read over and over.
5,"Fervent Trust in God always prevails - a must read for EVERYONE with much, little, or no faith","The spiritual impact this book has on its reader is amazing. It gives anyone, no matter how difficult their situation, the hope that your life is worth something. Given over to God, the life of every person is powerful.Even if you are not a ""religious person"" this story in itself is fascinating and nearly unbelieveable. It is written very well, making a most enjoyable read. A good laugh is also guaranteed.And for those of you like myself, tired of the liberal Church constantly chipping away at our Faith, you will have plenty to cheer about.Buy the book; you will not be disappointed."
4,Must Read,"For those of us who have followed Mother Angelica from the 1980's, when she was involved in the Catholic Charismatic Movement and heard her speak at some of the conferences, this book reminds us of how far she got by her faith and trust in Divine Providence. It is truly an inspirational book. I had forgotten what a fantastic sense of humor she has.Raymond Arroyo does a good job of writing her story. It is a testament to Mother Angelica's Faith in God, not matter what the cost."
5,A Beautiful Living Saint!,"Mother Angelica: The Remarkable Story of a Nun, Her Nerve, and a Network of Miracles by Raymond Arroyo is a fascinating look at one of the most inspirational people of the 20th century and who is still alive today. Her story is full of hope and shows how God is involved with all of us. She shows what happens when you say ""yes"" to God. She is a strong woman as you can probably guess but she is much more and this book brings you into her world and shows you just how reliance on God can get magnificent things done."
5,"Mother Angelica, A Nun, Her Nerve and a Network of Miracles","I come from near Canton and Cleveland, Ohio and the book is very clear about locations of where Mother Angelica grew up and lived. I plan to visit these locations, this November. The book has held my interest and I can't put it down. It gives you a real feeling that ""the impossible is possible"". I have my own plans of doing some fund raising for a Franciscan organization, I am volunteering for, and plan to use some of Mother's methods for raising needed funds. I suggest this book as good reading for all and a learning lesson in life."
3,"Good Hokey ""Latin"" Fun","I just spent an hour dumping this lp into my computer. It's a fun record, and I'm a moderate fan of Ramsey Lewis, and a big fan of big arranged fifties sixties and seventies pop. A few gems here are ""Hey, Mrs. Jones"", ""Function At the Junction"", and ""One, Two, Three."" But before spending $30 on this CD, check out, for example, Willie Bobo's ""Finest Hour"" CD. His ""Spanish Grease"" and ""One, Two, Three"" are genuinely ""latin"" in feel (it being Willie's native musical language helps), and the whole record is incredible. There are a few tunes on the Ramsey Lewis where the feel isn't any different than it ever has been, but they just throw a guiro on ""Lara's Theme"" or some cungas on ""Down By the Riverside."" It is goofy sixties fun, and its ""second gear"" songs, like ""Cast Your Fate to the Wind"" are nice enough, but the whole record never shifts into third."
3,Can't agree with the other reviewers,I'm sorry but I have to disagree with the previous reviewers who were quick to proclaim this album as a masterpiece. It's a good melodic acoustic album with proggy songs and good vocals. The melodies aren't all that memorable however. For some reason I find Manning's solo albums a bit difficult to grasp. His work with other musicians is a lot more interesting but that's not to say A Matter Of Life & Death is bad. I can't say I'm big on the vocals but the overall vibe of the cd is quite consistent which is important for prog listeners. He has some very interesting ideas and maybe I'll like his songs more in the future.
4,Concise and Practical,"This book provides a concise review of laser-tissue interaction. It begins by introducing a brief theoretical foundation in tissue optics and moves on to describing various interaction and ablation mechanisms. The chapters are very well organized, the materials are well presented, and equations are used only when necessary. A large chapter is dedicated to introducing various medical applications of lasers in different clinical fields. The materials in this book are very suitable for scientists, engineers, and physicians involved in biomedical optics. However, since the release of this book, significant progress has been made in this area, which requires the author to substantially update information and development in the next edition."
2,slow shipping......,"I placed an order on Aug, 21st, but now it is Sep, 21st already...I have not received my book!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Targus 10.5 in. DVD carrying case,"The case was fine for the 10 inch Player, but it Wouldn't hold the battery and the battery charger.You could cram it all in but you are in danger of damaging your DVD's. I would have been satisfied if it had been just a bit larger."
4,Perfect Case for Portable DVD,"I really like this case. It holds the player securely, has slots for dvd's or cd's and a handy outside pocket for accessory cords."
1,TOO SMALL,"Targus 10.5"" portable DVD player case is good quality but too small to accept even a 10"" DVD player."
3,This is the gothic romance that tops them all,"I think this was the first time I ever laid eyes on James Mason and Stewart Granger, and they were in their prime. The acting style was crisp British, the costumes were just right, and the story was pretty much as it had been written by one Lady Eleanor Smith, a writer I then proceeded to read every word of, at the age of 13. I'm sorry that this DVD is in Region 2. But time will tell. To the sophisticated of today this will be a laughable film, but to those who can roll in its pseudo-Jane Austen tale-telling, or just wallow in an old fashioned melodrama, this would be a lark. The heroine has a taste for 'sugared violets.' The villainous Mason has a taste for the riding whip, and Stewart Granger -- well, one could just eat him with a spoon. He gets to play an early 19th century Othello in the great 'Put out the light' scene, then smother Margaret Lockwood, the be-all and end-all of 'bad girl' characters in the Arthur Rank films of the 40's."
1,Have not received it as yet.,"As yet, have not received this. It's been nearly a month and no product. Perhaps I should cancel this sale or what?"
4,"Excellent, but not current","This is a reprint, printed in 2000, reducing 4-1 the pages of the orignal 13 volumes into 6 volumes. The orignal was published between 1910 and 1938, so this set does not include information more recent then 1938. Be sure to track down Vol. XIV, published in 1998, to complete the information. Otherwise this is excellent information."
2,Lacklustre,"In a book aiming to thresh out the dynamics of gender, Lorber's text seems to demonstrate that she doesn't have exactly the firm grip of the subject that the title suggests she has. While the other chapters which deal with more feminist issues with relation to gender are a bit more sound and solid, and the preceding chapters dealing with the 'nuts and bolts' of gender are somewhat vaguely fresh and readable (although not really saying much new), it is worrisome to see that while Lorber tries her hardest to remain objective, her dated and misunderstood views on transgender (she does not use this already popular term) issues betray her objectivity. All in all, her little inconsistencies and sometimes erroneous reasoning to gender, especially with regard to gender identity, do really show that she might have missed the boat with this one."
5,Very handy to have at hand.,The different colors for easy reference.Large size is very convenient to use when wrapping around a bundle of things.Good to keep on hand in the garage for everyone.
5,historical reference,"This is the most historically significant treatment of musical acoustics easily available. The serious musician should keep a copy for reference, but I don't recommend that the novice start here. Some fascinating musical ramifications of elementary acoustics are to be found in PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
5,Misprints.,"I found two misprints:Page 412, last equation on that page, x_2 = -b/(2a). ... : On the right-hand side, there are five terms. Terms number 2 to 5 have to be multiplied by b. In term number 3, replace u^2 by v^2.Page 417, second of the two equations, r_p = 16 B' B"" . ... : The second of the two brackets in the denominator must be squared.These two misprints occur also in the German original, possibly since 1863."
3,made in china not germany,"it is a cute toy. Even my husband had a blast playing with it. But.. I bought Haba because they are made in Germany. This toy is made in China. Makes me feel very unsafe for my baby and somewhat cheated. NOt that I have anything against China, just don't trust anything made in china for my baby"
3,It's cute but...,"This toy is very cute in the picture and also in person, but it is really not the best toy for an active toddler. First the wheels are attached with velcro which means it's another part my little 17 month old guy can rip off and throw down the stairs. Also, the three animals are connected by a small ball on one animal which is put inside of a loop on the next animal and they do not stay together when he really takes off and pulls it around the house. In the span of the first 10 minutes, I had to reattach them five times. Annoying! But it is a very pretty toy, brightly colored and the little animals are fun to squeeze. Still, I'm returning it because what I wanted was a sturdy pull toy, and this just isn't it."
3,Not what I expected,"This company is raved about by all the green sites. The claim is that it's a German company and it uses less toxic materials than other mainstream brands. I was disappointed to see that it was from a German company that has their product made in China. How is this any different than any other brand? There is no guarantee of quality materials when you outsource. The toy is cute, but I felt really misled. I have an 11 month old and I don't give him the train yet. I let him play with the animals. The train has some small parts (like a bead that is glued on to the pull string) and the train is easy to take apart. I guess there is no such thing as a quality toy that isn't mass produced in China anymore. :("
3,This toy falls apart easily.,"The velcro wheels on the teddy bears car came apart a week after we bought this for my 14 month old. And the tug rope is way too short. I had to tie an extra piece of string on the end to make it longer for pulling, now she loves it even though we're a car short."
5,Fascinating Record of a 19th Century Fraternal Order,"The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor was a fraternal order founded in the 19th century by the enigmatic Max Theon. People like Max Theon are usually described as 'enigmatic' or 'shadowy' and with good reason. But this book goes a long way toward shedding some light on Theon, Peter Davidson, Paschal Beverly Randolph, Emma Hardinge Britten, and others, all of whom had a great deal to do with the channeling of the American current of Magick. The research conducted by the authors' is truly impressive, although it simply left me hungry for more information. (Mr. Deveney has also written a marvelous biography of the mystic and seer, P.B. Randolph.) Read carefully, however, this book provides the background to the secret history of our times."
2,over-rated--money better spent elsewhere,"This dictionary is over-rated and not worth the money. Yes the format of the 3rd Edition is an improvement, since in early editions it was hard to mine through all the data to get to the point. Bauer is still too wordy, and for the price of this book you can get a Thayer, and LSJ Middle, and a Greek concordance to the NT."
3,Andre Rieu Collection (2CD),"This recording has nice music that I enjoy, however when listening with the Sennheiser headphones to get a true depth of the sound, it is not there. It sounds flat and the orchestra does not sound any better than a non professional (high school, etc) orchestra. It may be fine for some lively outdoor concerts, but for a recording,in and out of studio location it fails. I would now reconsider purchasing any other recordings and I do have many.If those responsible for making the recording would take the time needed for a professional recording, it would make for a vast improvement and to me this is just an attempt to get as many recordings out to the public. If you want to get people, who enjoy music, to return and buy additional recordings, make the recording you would want to hear again and again. After hearing this once, I will probably not listen to them again and go for some good orchestras."
5,More music for restfulness,"This was Mom's most favorite of the CDs I got her for Christmas. She is soothed at bedtime, or when she may wake in the middle of the night. She also enjoys this music during the day for its calming effect."
4,Zig's Review,GOT IT FAST.......IF YOU WANT TO RELAX AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ONE TO PUT IN AND SIT BACK OR PIDDLE AROUND THE HOUSE AND TAKE IT EASY.
4,Era issues,"This CD is only ""classical"" in the sense that it is music by an orchestra. It does not mean that the music is from the classical ERA of music. It is still beautiful music, but those of you who are trying to learn to distinguish the different time periods will be disappointed. The CD actually does claim to be from the classical ERA but actually has much baroque era and romantic era music on it (the romantic CD by the same publisher is also not era specific). In regard to some of the other reviews, while the classical era did have an emotionally detatched quality, not all of the music on here is classical! Still, for those of you looking for an introduction to ""classical"" music, it is a beautiful CD."
1,25 Classical Favorites,"The product description states that one of the 25 favorites is the Mozart Bassoon Concerto performed by Frank Morelli. That is not the case. Either they shipped the wrong CD, or the product description is wrong. NONE of the 25 tracks is the Mozart Bassoon Concerto."
5,Romantic Brazilian pop from the 1920s,"EMI's ""Cantores Do Radio"" series is a great look at the popular singers who came before the bossa nova era... plus, with two CDs at a single CD price, these are quite a deal. This collection features some of the most antique recordings in this series - nearly half the tracks are from the 1920s, and most of the others are of 'Thirties vintage. Although there's some samba influence, these tracks tilt towards acoustic ballads and romantic interpretations along the lines of Cuba's Antonio Machin and Miguel Matamoros rather than dance tunes. Great voice, nice arrangements... nice stuff! Highly recommended!"
2,Outdated,"I didn't look closely enough when I purchased the book. It's pretty old to be using as a guide for going to DFW today. But overall, informative."
2,Needs a strong editorial hand.,"As the protagonist makes his way across the dance floor of a club he detests, he treats the reader to all the dismal details of his miserable, debt-ridden, asocial life. Once he has completed the transit, he arrives at his table where his girlfriend waits. Then things really get bad. Although there is some interest in the scene where he confronts the demon cutting n on his date, one must wonder why this creature from hell bothers to recruit such a loser. Or why anyone should bother to read further."
1,"So, so bad.","As a lifelong Doctor who fan, it pains me to give one star to anything Doctor related, but this episode was so bad it made me angry.Despite the fact the writers said they planned this for a long time, it just seems thrown together and idiotic. And the ending, especially, seems drawn out to a point where you just like 'end already!'"
3,Not the best Christmas Special,"I have been a fan of the good Doctor since November 23rd 1963 and followed it faithfully as a child. David Tennant brought me back to the show and I have enjoyed every episode he has been in.I saw both episodes of the End of Time while staying in England over Christmas. The second episode in particular was very confusing and dragged, though the last twenty minutes and Bernard Cribbins' performance as Wilf redeemed everything. My sister theorized that Wilf is actually a time lord and I am still not discounting this idea. It was SO SAD to say goodbye to David Tennant.Summary: last year's special The Next Doctor was better."
5,Saved money,"I bought this for my freshman son's class at the Catholic school he is attending. While I can't comment on the content, overall I saved about $300 by buying his books on Amazon as opposed to the school bookstore (even their used books were much more expensive)."
2,a MISSPELL in a learn-how-to-write book?!,"I saw a previous comment saying the same thing as I'm about to say: a typo! I found a typo in a book that should have ZERO typos! I thought that maybe the previous commenter and I had encountered the same typo, but unfortunately for the author, not the case (the one I saw was on page 21. A 'you' should have been a 'your'). I saw this book on the bargain table, opened it and - I don't know if it was just sheer ""luck"", but the very first page I opened it to (and consequently the ONLY page) it just so happened to be the one in which I found a typo. I figured I had seen more than enough, closed it up as I quietly giggled to myself at the irony of it all and then proceeded to the check-out with me other selections. Big no, no!"
2,Very Basic,"I bought this book at Barnes and Noble because it was on the bargain section, quickly browsed through it, and thought okay, I'll give it a shot. Came home, started reading it, and realized how disappointing it was. I even found a typo! First sentence in the first paragraph on page 20. It has very basic info and some of the examples are not even that great."
5,Fantastic,"I just bought charles hammer's ""A Classical Guitar Christmas"" and I decided I simply had to tell you all how wonderful it is. I own a lot of Christmas music and that includes a lot of guitar music for Chrismas. This is one of my top 3 actually. the arrangments are fantastic. Some very simple others more complex, all wonderful. Highlights include: O Come O Come Emmanuel, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, O Holy Night and Deck the Halls. I reccomend this Album for every one who likes good Christmas music or just good music in general."
5,All the bio (as well as analysis) that you could ever need!,I don't think customer Lee Kane is quite right when he says that Tag Gallagher's labour-of-love book is mainly about the films. Gallagher's writing is spare and lean but he gives at least as much biography as the purely biographical books.
4,Makes For An Interesting Read,"This is a good book, even though not what I was looking for. The title says ""The man and his films"", but this book is mainly about the films. That means, if you are looking for the definitive Ford bio, this book isn't it.That said, this book does has its advantages. It explores Ford's movies in depth, revealing new facts and a lot of insight. It also has a lot o photos.If you want research on his movies, this is the book for you. If you want a biography, I suggest you read ""Hollywood's Old Master"" by Davis."
3,Lean Beef,Sparse book with little new revealed about Ford or his movies. Ford's film methods and his hard and cruel treatment of many actors (which is well-known) are covered. The book doesn't really let the reader know much about the man. It was interesting to find out Ford had a love affair with Katherine Hepburn. You have to wonder how many men she did sleep with to get parts in pictures?
2,nice size for a small gun but broke easily,The size was perfect for a larger .22 and the stap system made it easy to put almost anywhere but the buckles are cheep plastic and broke instantly.
4,Really good Holster,"It's a really nice holster. Hard to bend, holds a variety of guns, ect. It won't hold massive pistols, so don't think of using it for them. Delivery was kinda sluggish, took about a week, but it arrived on my birthday, so I'm not complaining. Umm......... a pretty big disappointment though.Speed really is a question with this gun. If the clipper is still holding the gun then drawing it will be a bit sluggish. Last week a group of hoodleums came into my neighborhood and started shooting up the streets (with pellet guns, of course. Never handle any group with REAL guns). My neighbor and I drew them off, and when my rifle ran out, and one of them had a gun aimed at my face, it took me a full 2 seconds to draw my weapon. I had to roll to avoid his shot. So, if you're in a gunfight, I suggest you keep this unclipped, or you'll wind up like what happened to me........ or worse.... Other than that, good holster. 4 of 5."
3,Review of Beethoven Favorites,"The case for the CD was broken but the CD was fine. Otherwise, I am very happy with the item."
5,Nice cd,I ordered this CD for my brother who is now taking piano lessons. The compositions aren't full length but they are good enough for a newcomer to get a feel for some Beethoven. I would recommend this CD to others.
2,Great Price...Not so good itself,"This a great priced cd, but the content is why it is so cheap. It's a true-amateur album. Beethoven Lover is over her/his head. This is the real world, not a fantasy-everyone-likes-every-type-of-music world. Deal with it and agree with me. It isn't so great."
4,"Good quality assortment, Gimmicky","These picks are much better quality than the ""Angel"" picks. Most of these are a little gimmicky and you probably won't find much use out of them. The standard white w/eagle, black w/eagle and spike picks are the best. The shark and cork (the cork is pretty thick) picks are for players with serious slipping problems and you can't choke up on either.I find these Clayton picks harder to hold than other picks on the market. A little pricey for 6 picks (you will probably only use 4 of them)."
5,A Must for every young man! Christian or not!,"With the lack of integrity now days it is a breath of fresh air to take a stroll through the life of Joseph. I've never known Joseph until I read this book. Mr. Swindol has done a wonderful job at bringing Joseph to life. Chuck mentions in this book that he believes it's his best piece. I would agree. If your having trouble with a teen or just a good read this is it! It teaches sexual purity, patience, faith and Integrity. All from a biblical stance. Not many books can impact a person or life as much as this book did to me. This book has been Spirit blessed. This book has changed my life and I know it will change others. I laughed and cried."
5,Joseph by Chas. R. Swindoll,"The preacher of my church preached one Sunday morning about Joseph, the fellow with the multi-colored coat fr. his father. Before getting into Joseph's life, the preacher told of how Jacob came into Rachel's family, and about Rachel's dad, Laban. Fascinating to me it was. I wanted to find a book to read about ""Joseph, etc.""--read what an author has penned. Charles R. Swindoll does an excellent job and in an excellent style of writing. I found the book to be a full-fledged account. Joseph's life was awesome."
4,Well Worth Reading,"I am still reading it and am in the middle of the book, so forgive me for a brief review. Tom Watson is one of few rare smart golfers whose words are trustworthy (he was a psycology major at Stanford). This is no exception and I enjoy reading it. As a relative novice in golf game, I didn't think much about strategy, but this book tells me that there are golf strategies I should learn. I read similar books written by Jack Nichklaus in the past and this book appears as good or better. Watson's ""The Timeless Swing"" is my golf Bible. This book became a good addition to it along with his ""Getting Up and Down""."
5,Great book from a legend,"Great stuff here from Tom Watson. I credit this book, and one of Raymond Floyd's with really getting me thinking about course management. If you really want to drop some strokes, you've got to learn how to think your way around the course. Tom Watson was one of the best at it and although this book is not long, he really gives you some stuff to chew over. Plus I like books with pictures."
2,Not long lasting,"I've always loved this perfume.Therefore when I ordered it from amazon, I was very excited. But somehow results aren't very encouraging..there is no sign of it after say 1-2 hrs of using it. I know perfumes work differently with different people but I haven't had any bad experience with me till date.This is the first one which I feel is not long masting at all. I love the fragrance but doesn't stay on for long."
2,Great Scent but..,"Yes, it smells great but you better take the bottle with you. It doesn't last but a couple hours at best."
2,"Nice scent, but fleeting","I guess it's one of those body chemestry things. I like the smell, but any trace of it is gone after a couple of hours."
1,Lies!! All LIES!!,"I have known this man since I was a child. His mother is close friends to my family. Everything he talks about...Lies. He has conned so many people out of money just so that he didn't have to work. His first wife is a very close friend of mine, his next two wives I graduated school with, and his 4th wife was a co-worker of mine. He's damaged his children and wives in ways I can't explain. If you really want to know the truth about Chad Gaines check out this page on facebook....The TRUTH about Chad Gaines. Everyone who knows him or his family personally have posted on this site the truth that they know...not the LIES! Please do not buy this book!!!"
5,a break-through!,"Voices From a Locked Room is a break through for all of us as children/parents that think we have it badly! It took me a very long time to sit and digest all the pain and hopelessness this boy turned man overnight, had to go through! I have learned alot from this book and more of the same I am sure from the second. I have three boys myself. Today I have learned many intelligent dignified choices in life due to Voices From a Locked Room and from Chad Gaines. I make sure that my boys are told every day that I love them! Chad Gaines has turned in a wonderful piece of work for all of us to understand and to learn from!"
2,Didn't last very long!,"I purchased this Sony-manufactured accessory for my PEG-TG50 Sony Clie, and I expected that it would last for as long as I owned the product. After all, it's just a carrying case, and it seemed relatively well made and stylish. However, the internal plastic lock/release mechanism that holds the Clie in place is broken after only two months of use. Not particularly durable! I'm exploring my warranty options even as I write this, but I'm not hopeful."
5,"Outstanding resource for the ""Old Guard"" Leather Man","This book has the best resource for anyone wanting to learn the ""Old Guard"" ways and means."
4,good biography of a good man,"This is a good book to read for anyone wanting to see how a good man dealt with adversity. Allen places much emphasis upon Davis' Christian faith, and how it helped him to be the sort of man who can be worthily imitated. The book also contains a goodly amount of historical information which is not commonly known. It could have used some tighter editing, as there were a few points where I was not quite sure about whom Allen was writing, and had to go back and re-read the paragraph, but, all in all, I was both informed and edified by this book. About the review by Kirkus, I can only conclude that that reviewer is an anti-Christian, anti-Southern bigot, as he obviously had already decided about the book before reading it."
5,Best Trek books in years,"Well, that was a fun ride. This trilogy is the best Trek prose story in years. Please let the Reeves-Stevens write more Trek. This trilogy feels much more ""epic"" in scope than most Trek series, even the other multi-book series. The multiple time jumps are quite a feat of editing, and the way everything finally falls together reminded me a bit of the end of Back to the Future II. The writers and characters do a wonderful, dizzying tap dance around past events, creating a nice interlocking puzzle that must be unravelled. If you've been avoiding the Trek books due to the feeling that they were getting repetitive, give these a try. If you've been following them all along, be prepared for a wake-up call. MILLENIUM raises the bar on what Pocket should be publishing from now on."
5,The final book of the series does not disappoint!,"Epically written, the third book in the Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Millennium series does not disappoint and will leave you feeling as though you truly read a great book. It begins just where the last book left off, letting us see what happened to all those engulfed in the two opposing wormholes. There are several time-jumps involved – I don’t want to give details for those who have not read it yet – and a brilliant job at tying up lose-ends that started in the first novel. I have to agree with another who posted a review on here. “MILLENIUM raises the bar on what Pocket should be publishing from now on.”"
3,Nice simple list,"Like a short _Scotland the Best_, sweet and easy. Not a tour guide, and doesn't try."
5,Nice for satelite outdoors,I'm enjoying my radio outside at work and outside at home when I workout instead of just in the car. Love the flexibility it brings.
2,Degunking Windows,"Another great book by Joli Ballew- This book, along with her past efforts is easy to follow and full of hints for both I.T. professionals and home users alike.The 'plain English' approach used in this work makes for an easy read and an easier fix for many of the aliments caused by simply using the internet. A copy of this book along with good anti-virus software may breed new life into your seemingly old and worn out computer."
1,Merv Griffin Show Disc 1,"Crappy. The sound was horrible and put together shabbily. Also, the discs are not even CLOSED CAPTIONED!!! Too pricey for a product that doesn't deliver."
2,BASIC AND BORING,After watching this ( as much as i could stand to) I realized why I never liked the Merv Griffin Show. He does not ask the questions that you wish he would. He treats the guests as though he were at a dinner party with them at his house and doesn't want to offend. So many interesting people and not a question thats eye opening in the bunch..What a waste !!!!
3,were is judy garland ?,i love the merv griffin show but were is judy garland in 1968 she hosted for one week it was the best . pleaes get this to dvd thank you david r heard
1,MERV SOLD OUT!!!!,"With all his money, I am so surprised at the poor quality of this set. The production is poor and we thought the selection of clips was done to make us want the good ones. It is like a tease. I say don't buy it, wait for the next series which I bet will have a better selection with better packaging inserts. Don't stiff us next time Merv!!! You need to think of us and not the money! Please upgrade the quality and give us the better clips! Thanks. We are such fans of yours."
1,Gone But Not Forgotten.......,"Where in the world are the clips of Sylvester (James) the disco queen's appearances? He was enthralling and captivating and shocked Merv by appearing in a dress on the show. For that time it was unheard of... unless it was Milton Bearle of course. But the clips of Sylvester should have been included, as he was one unforgettable character. So this gets 1 star."
2,Here's Merv Trying to cash in on the T.V. dvd craze,"I'm sure his shows were great back in the day. But the clips of some of the comedians are much too short, Also the clips are straight from the tapes, no digital restoration, etc. Now if he did them as full episodes then maybe they would have been better. Don't waste your money."
5,The Merv Griffin Show - 40 of the Most Interesting People of Our Time,So enjoyable to watch! Had watched his TV show many years ago and it is great seeing him with all of the people that he had as guests.
3,Interesting Interviews,I'm a big fan of Merv Griffin so I new I would enjoy this DVD automatically. He's a good interviewer and some of these celebrities are no longer with us as is Merv so it's a nice keepsake and the interviews are both funny in parts and interesting.
3,QUESTION: HE WAS TV'S TOP TALK HOST AND NOW HE'S A LAND BARON,"There's so much missing from this eight-and-a-half hour excursion down memory lane - where are Griffin's legendary chats with Judy? Bette and Joan? Until he decides to issue Volumes 2, 3, 4 through 19, we'll have to settle on the choices on these three discs - interviews with Hollywood legends (Orson Welles, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Burton), funny men (Jack Benny, George Burns) and women (Totie Fields, Phyllis Diller), historical icons (Walter Cronkite, Robert F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) and celebrated politicians (Ronnie and Nancy, Rose Kennedy). No one did it as well as Merv. He'd ask. Then he'd listen. Are you listening, Jay and Conan?"
2,no show,"i cannot give a good review as i didnt get dvd as i wanted, the merv griffin show , i wanted the one with john wayne and he wasnt in the i recieved."
1,"Decent sound, but poor design","I bought a pair of these two months ago, and I'm almost glad that they finally broke (doing the one-ear sound thing). They're designed to be comfortable with a nice flexible quality to the over-the-ear part of it - and don't get me wrong, they are comfortable. However, because they're so flexible, if you turn your head more than a little bit, the over-the-ear part flexes and the speaker part pops out of your ear. It's really frustrating, because I feel like I'm always poking them back into position.I have had other in-ear headphones that are rigid and that structure helps the earpiece stay put really well (made by Sony). I should have returned these after a week or so."
1,Don't waste your money,"The sound that comes out of these is great, if you can get them in your ears. The things wouldn't stay on! The ear hooks are so flexible that the only shape they will hold is the original shape that they come in. The speakers hung so low that they didn't fit into my ear and I had to constantly push them into place. What a bummer!"
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"I just bought these and spent about 5 minutes trying to get them to fit. They're perfect if you have oversized ears. I have normal size ears, and they are SOOOOOOO uncomfortable, too big. They don't sit comfortably behind my ear,and the speaker doesn't fit in my ear. It looks like they put the speaker on the wrong side; the speaker faces outward, so the people standing next to me can hear my music so I can't put the volume up too high. The sound quality is terrible so in order to hear my music while I'm on the bus I HAVE to put the volume all the way up, but then the person next me can hear it also because of the stupid design.I bought these because they looked sturdy, and they probably are, but they just suck. Its almost as though Maxell didn't test these on people, or they tested them on elves, because only oversized ears would find comfort in these headphones."
2,Skip them,"I bought these on vacation, as I left my good pair at home. They are nice looking, but they are so flimsy they fall off your ears. If you lean back or lay down, they just come right off. They won't even sit correctly when you are standing up. The ear hooks are bendable, but do not stay. I will just be dumping these. They were a total waste of money."
1,Flimsy,"Ear piece is a little bulky and the part that wraps around ear is VERY flimsy. As a result the headphones do not stay in place while out jogging. Constantly having to hold them in place to prevent them from falling out, which they did several times. Never had this problem before. Overall audio quality was ok, not great but not terrible. I suppose if you were sitting in one place and not moving around much these would be acceptable, but there are many better options for similar price. Not worth returning, I threw them out after using once. They were inexpensive so no big deal, but in retrospect I wish I had known they were so poorly made so I wouldn't have wasted my time buying."
3,The Sidekick won't fit in backwards,"The wheel should be at the right and the display pointed towards your belt. Otherwise the snap won't close properly, your Sidekick will fall out, you'll have the antenna pointed at your midsection to boot!"
2,"It works, but needs to be smaller","It works fine, but I wish it were all black and designed to be a little smaller. It adds about 3/4"" to the thickness of the hiptop and adds to the sides and bottom, too.The headphone port is usable, but not sure how you'd hang up or answer a call with it in the pouch.I keep my phone in it to protect it most of the time.Not sure about the velro strap in the editorial review. Mine has a belt clip that holds on really well."
1,A great way to DESTROY your Sidekick,"This beautiful-looking pouch will pop open if you jog a step or two while crossing the street. That's how my Sidekick flew out of the pouch and smashed its thumb wheel. Points for truth in advertising, though, as it really is a Danger Side Pouch--emphasis on DANGER!"
5,Page Turner,"Dr. Palmer was a professor of mine at American University and her book captivated my attention and opened my eyes to the many hurdles women in politics face. The many stories that her and Simon captured ever since women had been running for office were hilarious, heart-breaking, and inspiring. Their presentation of the data on advantages incumbents have demystifies why only 16% of the seats in the US House as well as the US Senate are held by women.This book should be read by everyone, but especially by those who wish to see a more equal representation in Washington!"
4,Beautiful choral music,If you like chamber and choral music this is a jewel. The movie is amazing too.
5,Les Choristes en concert,"The beutiful voices of the boys choir from the movie ""Les Choristes"" make this album of selections from the movie, as well as non-movie choral performances, an enjoyable listening experience."
3,Love and its illusions Paris style.,Eric Rohmer's three stories about the allure of love and it's illusions. One of the most insightful films about relationships that I have seen. Each story is real in it's depiction of relationships in a style that is unlike anything made in America. You will either be disapointed or touched by the stories as you see a litte bit of your own experiences portrayed. A unique look at young love by a elderly master who provides keen insight about young love.
4,"Much, much better than the debut","This is more like it - a surprisingly mature effort from such a young artist. In this case, dumping his original band was the best thing Mr. Meeks could have done. Expert backing from several Louisville-area music vets allows him to significantly expand his sound. Instead of the refried ""Alice In Chains - Sap"" sound of the first album, we're left with something considerably more interesting."
3,lacking the ede of their first album,when i first bought the days of the new debut cd i was blown away but as i listened to days of the 2 i can respect meeks but the music lacks the fire.
1,Total waste of money!,What attracted me to this cd was what I found out to be the only good song on it- Enemy. This album is totally weak and all I have to say is- save your money for something worthwhile like METALLICA!
4,a surprising & better sequence,"a lot have happened since the debut album which was good but one dimentional. the song writing is far much better and mature, incredibly for a 20 year old (which is younger than my age). however, sometimes that depht of the music is too much for the average rock fan who would seek an instant hit as ""touch, peel and stand"" or ""shelf in the room"". theres a lot of expectations that ""2"" create for the next one. as an ""alice in chains"" fan, which have let me down since ""jar of flies"", days of the new are here to inherit them. buy this cd guys, & let the groove of days of the new get inside. keep on the good work, meeks."
5,"Composition more advanced than first, music equal in emotion","Travis is simply an amazing musician. I don't know if he had some kind of troubled past, but his music is so raw and furious that it makes you wonder. I miss some of the aspects of the old band's sound, like some of the new keyboard arranged things surprised me, but naturally I grew to love this second self-titled album. (In fact, on a road trip to Maine, I listened to it for about 7 hours or more). Certain little parts in many of these new songs have a vocal line that is so strong and haunting it made me actually cry when I was listening to it...so angry, but so exposed and almost sincere. Hard-acoustic is the best innovation in a long long time, since the 70's i think. ANyone agree with me? I could rant and rave for HOURS just email me! tibet@dreamscape.com-rae"
5,Good album,"I was at first disappointed with this album but it definitely grew on me after the first week of listening. I think the album should of been called ""Travis Meeks...and Friends"" since this was definitely not the Days of the New we have come to expect. Travis totally grew from the last album I like the fact he doesn't just make another album that sounds similiar to the last. I think you always need to be trying new things and experimenting which is probably what his old band couldn't offer. Good solo effort Travis!"
5,GREAT!!!!!,"I haven't heard any new good, thought provoking, haunting, soulfull, inspiring, etc, music since I was growing up with Pink Floyd, the Who, The Doors, Zepplin, and on and on. I hope this young man Mr. Meeks stays with us for a long time to come. He will be among the greats!!"
4,GOOD ACOUSTIC RIFFS!!!,This album shows how Travis Meeks(Lead Singer) has improved over their last CD!! Nice driving music!!
3,Definately not what I expected.,"I was a HUGE DOTN fan after the first CD. I couldn't wait for this one and bought it the day it came out. But it's not really DOTN any more. He got rid of his band and TOTALLY changed his sound. I'm still a fan, but just not all that crazy about this effort. I would say that it shows some growth and certainly an interesting production... just not for me. Also, after seeing them live in Cleveland I thought Travis was a bit self inflated. I hope the next one is better."
4,"Good CD, but very different from 1st cd.","I really liked the first album. This album is good, but not nearly as amazing as the first. It has a couple of odd techno songs, but still worth a listen."
5,Best Album since AIC's Unplugged album!,"Days of the New II is nothing short of a masterpiece. This is Travis Meeks uncahined. He uses textured arrangements, horn sections, violins, and many other percussion instruments. I really love the tribal drums and eastern flavors on a few of the songs. It is almost the perfect record, no bad songs. There were no albums that came close to touching this in the late 90's. Firing the band helped him expand his creative juices. Buy this record or it will be your loss. I can't make out the words on the verses on The Real and I don't care, it is awesome. Enemy explores almost a celtic-dance vibe. Take Me Back Then and Bring Yourself are well orchestrated and the banjos are teriffic. There's not enough time to name all the great factors of this classic."
4,The sequel is better than the debut!,"The sophomore effort from Travis Meeks and (new)company reaches epic proportions with the involvement of orchestral arrangements and female vocals in contrast with Meek's Pearl Jam-ish vocals.Introspective and intense, this is one of the most interesting albums of 1999."
5,impressive,"I first heard this CD in my friends truck on the way to work last month. The next day I went out and bought and I haven't stopped listening to it since. An outstanding piece of work from a guy who can't even go into a bar yet. Similar to Dave Matthews Band, the album is built around an accoustic guitar. Weapon and the Wound is by far my favorite song. I strongly recommend this CD to anyone with a good taste in music."
4,IT'S GOOD,"It's a lot better than I thought it would be, Travis Meeks still makes acoustic rock sound awesome, keep up the good work Trav!"
2,2 For Who?,"The much anticipated follow up to their self-titled debut is a waste of time. I was highly dissapointed. I was expecting a slight advancement on their previous work, yet keeping with their style. The first single alone turned me off. Who's heard of Techno-Acoustic? The mix just doesn't work. If you like techno, buy Moby. If you like rock, buy Alice In Chains. If you like Days Of The New, buy their first album. By all means, don't buy 2."
2,Over-indulgent !,"One of the key highlights about the first album (and there were many) was that Travis and Co. allowed the songs to 'breathe'. The acoustic guitars and their arrangements really came out in full flight, with production to match, which together really allowed the songs to shine. The disappointing thing about the second album is that while the songwriting is fine, it is burried behind a wall of instruments and poor production. Those wonderful acoustic tones of the first album suddenly find themselves fighting for a piece of space in the background which in the end losses the 'essence' of what made the first album so unique and different. The bottom line is that now DOTN sound just like another band, will little, real differeniation. - Get back to the basics Travis."
1,not even close to as good as it could've been,"I was blown away by the Days of the New's first album. It will forever be in atleast my top five. I waited a long time to hear their new stuff and I was very very let down. This album is terrible. I listened all the way through the first night I bought it, and the next day I sold it back to the store. They have drifted from genious guitar and drums to stupid, unmelodic drum machines and synthesizers...terrible terrible music."
1,I'll Wait for the Days of the OLD,"Uh, what happened to Days of the New? This new album should be called Travis (it's all about ME) Meeks sings the blues. The new techno-beat and poorly structured songs can not even be compared to the first album. The vocals are fine, but the sound just lost the heart. I hope the Former DOTN band puts out an album minus MEEKS and prove they also have talent."
2,its ok,"i thought this would be a lot like creed but its more like country, if you like that rock country mix, this would be a good cd to buy"
2,Gothic Pretentious - Sound of horses hooves the best,I was looking forward to listening to this album but I've found it a big let down. Its simply dreary and pretentious unless you like walls of sound with vocals delivered in a wounded monotone. I think there are far better offerings available. The horses hooves at the start is a nice touch. Pity the rest of the album lacks both wit and imagination?
3,What Will It Sound Like Live?,"From what I have heard of 2, it is a worth having album, much like the first. Here is my big concern....I saw DOTN live when they opened for Metalica last summer. They blew me away. They were so clean and energized, it really was a great show. I must say that the vocals were a huge part of the show, but the band was fantastic. The lead guitar player was key to every song. Will DOTN be as good live with this new band that we know only a little about? And will we get to hear songs from the first album performed by the new crew? If you can't tell I think the break up of the original band was one of the worst musical happenings in recent times. You don't mess with something that good."
4,Mr. Meeks finds some maturity.,"Louisvillian Travis Meeks has made a solid CD that departs from the self-indulged angst that dominated ""Days"" first album. This CD contains very strong guitar playing by Meeks and starts out with one of the stronger cuts ""Flight Response."" ""Enemy"" almost has a disco feel to it(in a good sort of way) and the lyrics really shows he has matured and is willing to accept people more. Meeks' biggest asset is his honesty. If he stays honest, he will always have fans."
5,25 romantic classics,"i really enjoyed this cd also, highly recommended to listeners and lovers of instrumental music,excellent!"
1,Terrible,"Terrible sound, boring.... worst classical CD I have ever listed to. I highly recommend Mozart: Requiem."
2,Don't Bother...Really!,Not what I call classical composers! THis cd is annoying in a way I really can't stand. It lacks the pure elegance of the classical days. Don't buy this cd unless you want a phony all around bad album played by cheap ameteurs.
3,Could have been better,"I think the quality is good, and better on a few tracks, but all these romantic tracks?? Not what I listened to. Actually I was kind of disappointed; I had purchased an abundance of the ""Favorites"" collection some were better than others.I was kind of perturbed when some same tracks on this CD were on another CD, and visa versa.Still, I suppose for the price, one can't go wrong."
3,Misleading title scheme,"This is what bothered me about the CD. Three of the biggest eras in classical music were: the baroque era, the classical era, and the romantic era. Now, with CD's titled baroque favorites, classical favorites and romantic classics, one would expect these CD's to be era specific. Such is not the case. If you read the back of the CD it even says ""from the romantic era of music"", but the there are composers like Vivaldi (baroque) and Debussy (impressionism) on this CD. About more than half are from the wrong eras. So this music is romantic in the non-musical sense of the word, which is fine, but a little bit misleading."
1,The worst earbuds I've ever owned,"The sound isn't very good. They buds are too big to fit comfortably in my ears and made of hard plastic, despite the name ""Jelleez"". They fall out easily. The cord is too short, and it doesn't have that little ring that holds the two buds together when not in use. I think more thought went into the packaging than the earbuds themselves. I really can't stress strongly enough how terrible these are."
3,Priced right Earbuds,"Earbuds have good sound, plug size are large and don't stay in the ear as well as some. Cord could be longer. But what do you expect for such a good price."
2,The tiniest earbuds ever.,"I had a pair of Jelleez a few years ago and loved them, so I thought I would love these. But at some point over the last few years Maxell decided to change the size of the earbuds and now they are too small for my ears."
1,Not a quality product,"I purchased a pair of the black Jelleez in January 2009 and the left earbud has stopped working 3 months later. I use these daily for about an hour. These earbuds are not that comfortable for small ears and have a tendency to keep falling out. The sound quality is okay, no different from any other pair of earbuds I've had. I'm just not convinced these are a quality product since one side has stopped working after a few months."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I got these as a replacement for my old headphones that stopped working recently. I had this pair for a little over a month before the right channel blew out. Just stopped working. I don't use these more than I would think is usual, just on the bus ride to and from school. About 40 minutes for 5 days out of the week.The earphones themselves are made in an awkward shape that is heard to fit into your ear.The plug isn't very sturdy either. With my old pair, you could drop whatever they were connected to and catch it by the cord just fine. With these, the slightest yank pulls it right out. It doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but it's frustrating."
4,Nice Pair of earbuds,"It is a decent pair of earbuds for the price. It is comfortable to my ears but may easily not for others. Buds are made of hard rubber and not really soft enough (not ""jellylike"" or ""jeleez"" as the package seems to convey) to conform with the shape of your inner ears.Pros:- Inexpensive- Good audio at both low and high volume (What would you ask for a 5-10$ earbuds? I am not expecting it to sound like a 99$ Bose or 300$ Shure)- No detachable foam or silicon buds to loseCons:- The size of the earbuds will not fit everybody.- The cord is too wiry and rubbery. The surface is a dust magnet."
2,Don't waste your money,"They suck all around. Why? Because:- If you have small ears like me, be prepared to shove them in just to get them to stay. Plus they're painful.- The only thing ""squishy"" about them is the cord that connects it to your ipod, mp3 player and what not. The buds themselves are NOT ""squishy"" nor ""jelly"". Can we say hard (as hell) plastic.The only pros about this product that I can find is that they're cheap and come in different colors.Sound quality is blah. Just save up your money and spend it on quality stuff."
2,Not that great,"These are called ""Jelleez"" which, along with the fact that the label says ""soft rubber"" might lead you to believe, like I did, that these will be soft and fit comfortably in your ear. Don't believe it. If there is any soft rubber, then there's only a tiny layer of it over hard plastic. They're not really squishy or soft. These would not stay in your ears that well, unless you pushed them in and that's just not comfortable.And, as another reviewer mentions, the cord is rather short. The sound is Ok, about as good as I'd expect from $10 headphones.I paid $9.99, which isn't a lot, but when you can buySony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)that are super-comfortable, sound great and stay put - for about the same price - why bother with these?I expected better quality from Maxell."
2,Blue Earbuds,The transaction was great. The product itself was not what I expected. The cord is short and the buds themselves are big and uncomfortable. In an emergency they will work fine.
2,They are hard,"Purchased this via internet and thought the tips would be soft... they are not. They are hard. Also, one of the ear pieces broke yesterday. It was for my daughter who is 9, and kids can break things... but one week?"
2,poor sound quality,"Very disappointed with these ear buds. Has to much bass, highs are poor, tried to equalize them out but still poor sound quality. And within the first week the wires inside them were broke. Would love a refund since we bought 3 pair. Would not recommend these."
5,Discover Ancient Latin Paleography,"There is something mystical and wondrous about ancient writings; perhaps they are tangible evidence that voices from the past continue to speak to us. Allow your students to discover the art of paleography while practicing their Latin linguistic skills with this magical book. It begins with a thorough introduction to the background of Terence and comic playwrights, ancient manuscripts, and ancient styles of writing. The play itself is presented with a good quality photo of the original text from the Codex Bembinus (with original notes in the margins) on the left hand pages with the Latin text transcribed in type on the facing page. At the back there is the complete edited text along with notes and a vocabulary gloss. Reading this play while studying the original manuscript will allow students to gain a deep appreciation, fascination, and understanding of how we preserve history and how we know today what the ancients spoke."
5,A never-ending delightful reading,"30 years ago, I fell upon this book during a visit to the British MuseumIt entranced me so much that I engaged myself in learning chinese for the pleasure to catch the original flavor of these concise and overwhelming textsThat was the beginning of a never-ending interest for the chinese arts, and other asia-pacific culturesOver the years, I moved to places, leaving what I did not really need but this particular book is still with meA fully-enjoyable and refreshing reading by the poetic sincerity of so unexpressed feelings"
5,"Boxcar Satan ""Crooked Mile March""","What a leap forward! After seeing these guys a couple times and buying ""Days Before the Flood,"" I was blown away when I heard ""Crooked Mile March."" They've always been a pretty good noise rock band, but with this album they've taken a major step forward in terms of songwriting, ideas and diversity. There's a twisted Southern feel running through it like they put a bunch of old blues, country and gospel songs through a blender and reassembled them in some twisted, ultra-amplified version. ""Best Be Gone"" flirts with bebop and free jazz, ""Palm Psalm"" is a quirky gypsy polka and ""On the Midway"" and ""Donkey Lady"" are revved up Delta blues with spastic guitar work and thundering bass. They're definitely upholding the tradition of screwed-up Texas music started by folks like the Butthole Surfers, Scratch Acid and maybe even Roky Erickson."
4,note-taking aid,"This is a good book to help your student begin to learn how to take notes. This is seldom taught in school, but always needed."
5,Doumbek Stand,"Great stand, very adjustable and well made. Recently purchased for use in ""Shrek"" the musical where I had to play doumbek, djembe, congas and bongos in a compact set up. Great quality...Bill Vits, Grand Rapids Symphony Principal Percussionist"
1,Disappointing,"I have recently became very interested in books written by former law enforcement officers,so i was very interested in this book.I am not going to say that this is a bad book per se, but it wasnt what i expected.First, the title is misleading.I was under the impression that i was going to read about difficult cases and the way FBI solve them.But the truth is that every case gets one, two pages at most.The cases are discussed briefly with only a couple of things to learn from.And second, this book is basically a biography of Mr Depue, so i was very disappointed when i kept reading page after page of Mr Depue telling us the story of his life and his opinions about basically everything.I think this book should have been called Robert Depue:A Life.I dont mind reading several pages of anybody's history and background, but in this case,you are reading the authors life,nothing else.If you are into reading about profiles,forensic cases and the like, then this is noy your book."
4,Tube Zipper is a Ripper!!!!,"Awsome pedal........not for everyone. I use this with a tube amp and is unreal the freaky sounds you can get. The key with this pedal is the up down switch which controls the direction of the Q. Every time you move the switch you must change the frequency knobs to get the sound you like. Great for wah flutters, scooped wah filter sounds, and all out mayhem. If your looking for a normal wah this is not it, if you want to be different this is a great pedal."
2,Not all there.,"Five or six chapters in, I doubt I'll finish. It's probably interesting to Terry Brooks fans, but...The opening chapter goes into some detail about how he's ""not all here,"" explaining that his attention is usually in the world of his writing instead of on his ""real"" world surroundings. Unfortunately, he's not all here in the book, either. It feels amazingly superficial, like Brooks was severely distracted while writing it. I can barely remember each chapter by the end of it.Several pages, I've simply skimmed, looking for something worth reading and coming up empty. I expect I'll ""finish"" it that way, if at all.By contrast, I found King's ""On Writing"" to be inspirational, instructive, informative, and engaging. I sincerely wish I could say the same for this book."
5,This book should be on every writer's bookshelf!,"I've been a fan of Terry Brooks since I saw 'Elfstones of Shannara' in a bookstore back in the early 80s. In some ways, I believe it was Mr. Brooks who inspired me to become a writer, although I write non-fiction. I decided to read this book to finish out my Brooks collection and I'm very glad I did. There were many valuable tips and lessons expressed in his book, which read more like a story than an educational book for writers. I walked away with many invaluable lessons that I will apply to my own writing from now on, such as reading my own words and finding the music hidden in my writing. Thanks Terry for another great read!"
1,It's a complete dissapointment.,"Consider other books if you want to seriously learn UML or OO Analysis/design. A good design notation like UML should be intuitive and is better explained with examples. By reducing or avoiding examples as suggested by the author, the book is left with almost nothing."
1,Very poor,"A very poor book on UML. Many of the descriptions are either lacking in important information, poorly executed, or simply wrong.One example: pp. 94-95. The activity diagram is supposed to describe flows for a given object, except that object is never given. The text states: ""Figure 7-7 shows part of an activity diagram relevant to our bookstore."" Gee, couldn't the author have stated which object? Perhaps put a title on the diagram indicating which object? Instead, it is left to the reader to decipher what the author means.Similarly, the flow of the book is extremely poor. Classes and associations before before use cases? In that, only one page on objects?Yeah, sure, the book is simple to read but why would one want to read something this simple when it will only set you off in the wrong direction?I only gave this thing 1 star because I can't give it 0."
2,Needs more substance,"This book starts pretty well, but then you realize that it won't really take you anywhere. He abuses the use of ""references to previous and future chapters"" over and over, many of them are absurd, it almost seems that he had no material and wanted to ""fill"" the page.He does use a language that is ""readable"" to people with no computer background, but that is exactly were is going to leave you: with no real UML background.If you are looking for quicker and solid results check out ""Sams: Teach yourself UML in 24 hours"", I normally don't by any ""short cut"" book meaning ""24 hours!"", but the way this book was written is an excellent way to provide a good background, foundation, hands-on, technical and practical use of the UML. If you don't have an Object Oriented Design background, this books gives you a good start on it as well."
3,it needs improvement,1) Book does a good job regarding with it promises- Introduction to UML- UML diagrams2) Sequence diagrams are step-by-step well explained3) The lack of code examples make the book somewhat weak
5,"Wise, non-judgemental, and inspiring","I read this book after I read Karen Kingston's ""Space Clearing"" book, and, even though the two authors apparently work together, the two books are like night and day in their approach. Ms. Kingston's book was very rigid and authoritative. Although Ms. Kingston's techniqes may work for some, her book made me feel anxious and ""wrong"". Ms. Linn's book encourages people to rely on their own intution and trust their own feelings rather than following traditonal ""rules"". She gives examples of space clearing techniques from many cultures and encourages you to make your own rituals rather than following some set technique.You may not agree with all Ms. Linn's ideas, but she presents them in a way that allows you to consider them and then make your own decisions, rather than telling you that you have to believe what she believes. Reading this book was like talking to a wise, loving, friend - I recommend it."
1,BE CAREFUL!,"First of all, Denise Linn seems to change her experiences, beliefs, and even hedges on her ethnicity. (I have a good friend who has read all of her books.) That weakens her credibility in my eyes.She also suggests some very basic techniques . . . . and some that were new to my grand-niece, who tried the ammonia and epsom salt trick. It backfired on her and she ended up in the emergency room on a ventilator.I just want people to know that even though American Indians or Chinese people or Wiccans practice some of these methods, they're not for everyone and they're not necessarily safe."
2,Sacred space,"A neat book, with lots of woo woo and a mish mosh of religious ideals. A little too mixed up for me."
4,"Good, but with minor editorial inconsistencies","I really am enjoying this book. It is comprehensive and thorough in its coverage of many, many methods of clearing and purifying space. I'd like to give it five stars, but since I've stumbled on a few minor editing inconsistencies, I'm only giving it four. For instance, on page 118, about plant spirits, Ms. Linn says in a parenthetical insertion ""(For how to find your totem plant see Chapter 14.)"". Unfortunately, Chapter 14 doesn't give you this information. Earlier in the book we are directed to the Appendix for sources that sell air ionizers and ozone generators, appliances I know nothing about. There is no section in the appendix for this, and no source indicated. Minor beefs, yes, but irksome ones. This prevents me from giving this book more stars."
4,Good Read,"As an interior designer and Feng Shui practitioner, Sacred Space is a special addition to my collection of Feng Shui books."
3,Interesting characters,We watched this movie when we vacationed in Pureto Vallarta where it was filmed. It was fun to find the statue in town of the director and travel to a more remote location where it was filmed. The Bonus sections added to the interest.
3,the movie that MADE puerto vallarta hot,"the film version of tennessee williams's last hit play stars richard burton as a defrocked episcopal priest who cant keep his zipper zipped and winds up a seedy tour guide for americans visiting the then remote mexican village of puerto vallarta. for its time, john hustons film is pretty uncompromising in its depiction of sleaze, and he brings out solid work from ava gardner and sue lyon, but deborah kerr fails to fully bring out the frustrated sexuality of her character. im not a williams lover (hes too in love with his own symbolism for my taste), but i think this was about as good a version of this work as could have been made."
4,Great Film you can feel the heat of P.V.,Sometimes you just have to go back to the sixties to get good plain fun from a film.
1,Dreck,"It takes a lot to screw up Tennessee Williams, but John Huston did it royally. Whatever was the man thinking? This movie is so bad that for a while there in the middle I thought perhaps I had it all wrong, perhaps it was supposed to be a comedy.Ava Gardner's acting is even worse than her phony Southern accent. Deborah Kerr is well, Deborah Kerr. Has she ever played anyone else. Richard Burton turns in a complete triumph of overacting. He chews the scenery from beginning to end.And don't even get me started about Sue Lyon and those ridiculous beach boys. As for the women on the bus.....caricatures of the worst kind.Pah!"
5,Totally Excellent !!,"Great play ... Great acting ... Great direction ... although nobody won Oscars. Who cares? John Huston wisely filmed this in stark black and white reflecting its somber tone. Burton gives the performance of lifetime as Shannon at the end of his rope, and Kerr is fantastic, as always, imbuing a tender role with even more humanity. T. Williams' play, one of the best from America's best playwright, has everything. Conflict, strong characterization, wisdom, and of course humor. Some of the coarseness of the play has been excised (Shannon's), thus making him a more sympathetic character, but this does not hurt the movie. Huston sticks pretty much to the actual play, except for the ending, which was not in the play. However, this does not really hurt the film. Anyway, buy this film and enjoy it again and again. Your life will be richer for it."
3,"Hot, hot, hot","Strong female characters, excellent acting, ......Iguana's were a bit doll.....the boys were hot...so was Richard B......Watch it they don't make movies like this anymore"
4,Night of the Iguana,"Beautiful to look at! Wonderful movie.Well done over all, yet as an adaptation of Williams's play I always feel it is missing a little something-but just a little something."
2,Don't know what the raves are about,"It is an interesting experiment in story telling in its time as the cast sweats it out along the mexican backroads. However, the dialogue is too broken and confusing many times, there's too much left unsaid in many parts. I didn't feel sympathy or a connection to any of the characters, and the chemistry between them is lacking or stereotyped. I found Ava Gardner hugely annoying with her maraca boys. The characters are largely too flighty and emotional, and worst of all the whole iguana motiff is finally trite and simple. Thumbs down."
2,Made In Thailand!,"I have been buying K&N products for all my cars and motorcycles for 30 years, THIS finally ended my relationship with K&N. I've paid a premium for K&N products over the years for a reason. They just eliminated that reason. If they don't have the decency to manufacture their overpriced products in the USA, I will not use this filter or any other K&N product on my overpriced Ducati (or any other of my vehicles ). K&N should state beforehand that they (along with most other USA companies)have ""sold out"", at least then I would not have felt duped. Maybe that is why the other reviewer is having so much trouble with this filter."
3,Would be great if it had better battery life,"I borrowed this saw from an electrician friend and made a few cuts and was impressed with how light the saw was, how well it cut and how well it seemed to be made. Based on these test cuts I ordered one, buyin the much more expensive model with the better batteries and one hour quick charger. The first time I used it after fully charging the batteries, I was disapointed that it only cut for about 20 minutes of repeated cutting through 16 ga. tubing. To compound the problem the one hour quick charger seemed to take significantly longer to charge than an hour. Bottom line was that it couldn't keep up with the kind of use I needed it for, so I sent it back. On the bright side, Tool King/Amazon was great about taking it back and promptly processing a refund and didn't charge a restocking fee.If Stout ever comes out with a Li-Ion version, I will probably buy one."
3,"Works pretty well, but...","I bought the handheld bandsaw and cutting station at a local hardware store, and it has come in handy on a number of occasions.I have three complaints:(1) The blade life is poor. It may be due to the constant twisting it's subjected to (it runs in a twisted loop). And when it's broken I've found numerous near-breaks along the blade.(2) The table provided by the charging stand isn't quite flush with that of the saw, so it's necessary to use a piece of wood as a working surface.(3) If you need to cut long pieces that are more than a couple inches wide, the material will run into the saw.Battery life isn't great either, but it seems to hold a charge when not used for a while."
3,Great saw-terrible batteries,"After having the saw a few weeks i put my hacksaw away. I should have waited cuz it wasn't long after that the stout batteries were garbage. I bought two more and in less than a year they were junk. Now i either have to spend another $150 in batteries or cut my losses and try to find my hacksaw. The blades aren't much better than the batteries. The saw itself is nicely balanced and works great with one hand but knowing what i do now, i wouldn't bother"
2,SHORT LIFE,"I'VE HAD THIS SAW FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I LOVE THE SAW. VERY HANDY, ESPECIALLY FOR CONDUIT WORK.THE BATTERIES ARE USELESS. SHORT LIFE, WON'T HOLD A CHARGE.IT WAS TIME TO REPLACE BATTERIES, AGAIN. FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD WAIT, HOPING STOUT WOULD CATCH UP WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND GO LITHIUM ION. THEN I THOUGHT AT $69. EACH FOR NI-CAD, LI-ON WOULD BE EVEN MORE. PLUS THE COST OF A DIFFERENT CHARGER.I'M GOING TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND BUY A LIGHT WEIGHT CORDED SAW. NEED POWER ANYWAY TO CHARGE THE USELESS BATTERIES."
5,The spirit if blues music for guitarits and singers,"I bought my first issue of The blues bag 20 years ago. I get started with blues guitar playing with it. Reflects the essence of blues music : simple, but deep and full of emotions. Songs are beautiful."
5,Country Blues Songbook,"It's a songbook with lead sheets of some classic country blues tunes. I don't have a great ear, but I know how to read music and this has helped me learn how to sing some blues songs and phrasing in guitar playing. It also gives you lead breaks! The Blind Blake tune could use a syncopated bass line, but that's easy to figure out (as opposed to playing). Overall the styles visited are fun and informative."
3,Old information presented in a new way,"We all have regrets. After all, we're human. Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda shows us how we can rid ourselves of regret, even the regret that has become guilt or shame. In simple language Shoulda Coulda Woulda helps us distinguish real guilt with false guilt and with feeling those guilty feelings and actual guilt.Read this book with an open mind and learn how to heal damaged emotions and relationships. Shoulda Coulda Woulda asks us to take a hard look at unhealthy perfectionism. It also asks us to forgive ourselves and others and to bring closure to past hurts. Making good decisions, will, Dr. Perrott says, help prevent future regrets from piling up and becoming an unmanageable part of our lives.The book also includes self-assement tools and questions. Also note: Dr. Parrott believes that we all need God's grace to free us.This book is old information presented in a new way. The fact that there is nothing new does not mean it's less valuable however."
5,JESUS is an UNDENIABLE reality & HEAVEN truly EXISTS!,"This book COMPLETELY eliminated my fear of death and drastically changed my outlook on LIFE here and now! Never has a literary work affected my day to day existence. THIS HAS! I've given it as a gift over 20 times to date and plan to continue doing so for the rest of my life here on earth. TEARS of joy flow uncontrollably throughout reading. Warmth, assurance, growth, new understanding, amazement, hope, joy, LOVE. It'll actually make you want to read your BIBLE."
3,Pleasant if unremarkable...,"This album is a rather straightforward recording of Christmas carols, as performed by a bell choir and an organist. The sound of a bell choir is rather unique, and I got some funny looks from my co-workers when I played this album in the office.It is certainly functional as background music, though there is nothing especially notable about the recording. I listen to it periodically throughout the Christmas season and would recommend it to anyone who wants some pleasant Christmas music or who really likes the sound of a bell choir."
3,Good product - not so great packaging,"I like taking the tart cherry tablets in lieu of drinking the juice, however, I'm a little concerned that each bottle has no safety seal of any kind. Think the packaging could be a little more secure."
2,Almost worthless,"Pills are to big to swallow, need to cut in half. It is easier to buy Juice concentrate, and just mix with water, then drink. Won't buy again."
2,Easy install but lacks security,"The look, fit and installation were all great. It installed easily and looked good but performance lacks. I locked the mechanism and tried the handle. It put up a little resistance and then with a minimal amount of extra force, the handle popped open. I then took it back out to verify I had installed it correctly...I did. I immediately removed the unit, boxed it back up and returned it for a refund."
2,it's cheap but it does not work very well,It takes a LOT of pressure turning the key to make it lock. I can feel a broken key in my near future. Spend the extra dollars and get a higher quality version.
5,"great, easy and durable.",i got this for my tailgate since i was getting a tonneau cover and it works great on my 04 chevy silverado and it will works since i got it 7 mo ago. would recommend
4,Bully LH-003,This is a very good product for people with a Tonneau cover or who thinks they might get there tailgate stolen? But yes it does come with the screw one size to big. I made a quick trip to ace hardware and got it installed in about 10 minutes. Way easier than alot of other reviews say it is. I installed this on a 2005 chevy silverado crew cab and its looks factory installed.
1,Not as hoped,"This lock installed relatively quickly and easily, but doesn't really work. The locking mechanism interferes with the operation of the handle, but if you pull hard enough you can get the tailgate latches to release and open the gate. Plus, after doing that, the pressure on the locking mechanism now makes turning the key VERY difficult. Good thing it didn't cost much and the rear door for my new cap blocks the tailgate from opening or I would be a lot angrier."
4,Very pleased with this product!,"Despite a lot of the negative reviews, I am very pleased with this product. They must have fixed the bolt concerns because mine worked just fine. The only complaints that I have are the keys are a little too big but not a big deal and the bezel could fit just a little better. Not quite OEM quality but still very nice for the price. Bezel hasn't fallen off like some of reviews claim, but doesn't fit quite flush like original bezel did. So its 4 stars for me and you definitely can't go wrong for the price!"
2,Works after re-work.,"I just finished installing this on my 2002 GMC Sierra Pickup. First, it's a weak design and made the tailgate more difficult to open as the latch levers have to push against the cam levers of the lock. The lock is often difficult to engage unless the existing latch is 'snapped' a couple of times to get everything properly aligned. Finally, I was having trouble getting the screw to engage the threads in the mounting bracket. On close inspection the threads in the bracket had been damaged during manufacturing. There were slivers of steel wedged in the threads that would not allow the screw to start. I had to get a tap and rechase the threads to clean them up enough to work.I have it all working, but I think it is a weak design and poorly made. I would not recommend it."
3,OK lock,"Bully LH-003 Tailgate Lock works OK but was not too easy to install. The mounting bolt would not grab into the lock body. I had to drill out the hole and install it with a different nut & bolt.Also, if you have a bed liner it becomes more difficult as you have to remove the other two bolts holding the latch in place."
2,Only worked for 2 months,"It worked great for about two months of having it, after that the tailgate was able to break past its locking mechanism and now I have to go looking for a new one..."
1,Broke in less than a week!,"Because it's so cheap, and the only match I could find, I'll probably buy another one but wouldn't recommend it. The thing broke in less than a week making it impossible to open the tailgate without pushing on one of the release bars with a screwdriver.The only thing I will say that is not included in description, yes it does come with the lock and keys and hardware; crappy picture shown for a crappy product."
2,POOR QUALITY order ID 102-5661946-8710600,"Received the BULLY lock, and when I tried to install the retaining bolt/screw was WAY too big for the threaded hole in the lock. Had to drive off to the hardware store to find the correct screw. Would I recommend this item? NO WAY. the quality control is no-existent here. One would think that a simple screw should be easy, but no. I should have disputed the CC charges but it is also very cumbersome."
4,Bolt too short,"Good product, again like the rest of the people that have left a review for this item, I had to get a longer bolt at the hardware store....I also have a sprayed in bed liner and I wonder if the thickness of the liner was the cause of the bolt being too short? Anyway glad I made the purchace and would do so again, even if I knew that the bolt was going to be too short."
4,Good Value,"Good alternative to factory replacement . Cheaper , and almost exact . Hardware fit was near perfect too . Not exactly thief proof , but will slow them down a lot . Would recommend ."
3,Could've been better,"I bought 2 of these. I installed one on my 2002 silverado without any issues in less than 15 minutes and works great. The second one I installed on my grandpa's 2003 silverado and had issues with the screws. The screws did not thread into the female end, luckily we had a tap to thread it. Took 3 times as long to install, but worked well afterwards. Would've given it 5 stars if it werent for quality issues!!Bully LH-003 Full Size Tailgate Lock"
4,Easy to install,"This tailgate lock was very easy to install on my 06 silverado. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is the plastic housing isnt exactly a perfect fit.. If you grab the handle too hard the whole housing pops out. Its easy to put back in but still..Other than that it does wht its supposed to do, lock the tailgate. For the price you cant beat it."
5,Bully LH-003 Full Size Tailgate Lock,"Had been looking for a tailgate lock for years. This one was as easy to install ,anyone can install this product. But when installing it, be sure to juggle the lock when tightening the bolt up that holds it in. As you will think its bottomed out, but it still has a 1/16"" left.Plus make sure its centered, if not that is where people talk about it not working right.The cover that came with this lock, fit same as factory. Mine had came off, checked on just this piece and it was higher then the whole package from Bully.After getting it installed, it works great! Now I can lock our Retrax bed cover and the Tail gate.If your looking for a tailgate lock, this is the one you want. On a scale from 1-10 this product gets a 8.5, would be a ten.WildWolfproducts.com"
5,works great,"Product came on time, installed easily, works great. Highly recommend. Every once in a while my latches on my tailgate stick. I believe it to be because of this devise, but a bang on either side of the gate allows it to unstick and the lock to freely spin. Overall very happy. A must with my new tonneau cover, and there has been a rise in the theft of tailgates. I leave it locked all the time. -Enjoy!Rob"
3,Easy to install but also easy to get open,This product was very easy to install. My issue is that it still will allow the handle to be opened if pulled a little harder than normal. I am hoping a thief would just skip mine if he saw the lock because it sure would not take much effort to get it open. I do not understand why gm does not put a factory lock on their tailgates. All the fords have had them for some time now and they use your truck key.
2,Temporary fix,This part looks good but it is not OEM and therefore does not stay in place and easily falls off when you open the tailgate If not careful. It would work well if it would stay in place and not come off so easy. It is a good idea and would work well if it was made to stay in place and wouldn't fall off everytime you open the tailgate.
2,Not so good,"The design may lock the mechanism so so, but bump it a little and it pops open even when locked..The plastic bezel doesnt snap into place like it is supposed to and every time i drop the tail gate it falls off.So, not very satisfied at all!!"
3,My first CD with DJ Networx 24,"I really like CD 1. It really kicked ass. However, I am so disappointed on CD 2. It's SUCK because it is too slow. Personally, I don't like CD 2 at all. I hope DJ Networx can do better than that."
5,Approaching the summit of MBV,"DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM...Unless, you want to be consumed by it.Ecstasy & Wine has some of the best songs from MBV (The Things I Miss, Clair, You've got nothing & (Please) Lose yourself in me...AMAZING), actually, there is not a bad song on this compilation of the two ep's. It's definitely up there with both You made me realise and Feed me with you kiss ep's (Creation Records, circa 1988 - if you don't have these, you don't know the true power of MBV)."
5,Fantastic first blocks for baby!,"This is the perfect first set of blocks for a baby because they're soft so baby can't get hurt. The colors are vibrant and most of the pieces make some sort of sound, either rattling or crinkling. My 7 month old is too young to build with them herself, but she has fun knocking down my creations. This is currently my favorite toy for my baby, and I love that the blocks are washable, unlike a lot of soft toys out there that are surface wash only (which is kind of garbage in my opinion). Also unlike plastic toys, you don't need to worry about chemicals like phthalates leaching out of these blocks when your baby chews on them. Haba toys are great because they're very well designed and Europeans have more stringent requirements and do more testing for children's toys."
5,The best first blocks,"the color, sound, textures are great for 6 month +the quality cannot be better: it's from HabaI buy this toy for anyone in my family who is expecting"
5,We love these blocks!,"We bought these when our oldest was 18 months. Now they have been loved by two more children as well! Even our four and a half year old still enjoys building with these occasionally, although she prefers her wooden unit block set more. Perfect for ages 9 mo - somewhere around 2. I like that they can't fall and get hurt on them when they're learning to get around, and they can't hurt themselves or anyone else when they bang with them or toss them. My kids use these a lot with another Haba toy called the Big Voyage. They use the blocks to build houses for the little animals. Definately one of my favorite baby toys."
4,Johnny,"I first saw Johnny Summers when he was a guest clinician at a band camp of mine in junior high school. I really liked his personality and his playing so I thought I would try and follow his music career, which wouldn't be too hard since he is from Calgary and so am I.I saw him do a show live downtown once and they were selling CDs there. I got a copy of this album and I really think it's pretty great. I play the trumpet but I'm not a real expert on all the great artists out there; I do however, know what I like and this album is something I like.The tracks don't all sound the same. He uses both the flugel and the trumpet throughout this CD and some of the tracks have more of a blusey feel while others are quick tempo and moving. I would recommend you buy this album if you are into trumpet/flugel/vocals/jazz/blues."
4,What every gun needs.,"Tippmann has been making these since the A-5 and they are great. It holds all you parts nice and neat, no searching for them. Everygun needs to have a kit like this."
5,Great for homeschooling,"I first got this book a few years ago for my oldest daughter to teach her to read. It worked! The book is very step-by-step. It doesn't jump ahead before you are ready, etc. I purchased a second book last year for my younger daughter. She is now reading very well! The book contains phonics for grades Kindergarten through second grade, but both of my kids loved it so much, they finished the whole think in their Kindergarten year!!... My kids love them all and so do I!"
3,Great... If You Like The Traditional Teaching Style,"This books fits well with those who like to teach in the traditional teaching style. It covers all the phonics you'll need from Kindergarten through 2nd grade: consonant sounds, short vowels, long vowels, rhyming words, word order, sentences, verbs, compound words, synonyms, antonyms, homonyms, nouns, etc.It isn't a great fit for me as it's very workbook oriented. I homeschool my children in a more multi-sensory style, using hands-on activities, visual, and auditory combined. This book tends to focus more on the visual learner and not very much for a child who learns using hands-on or auditory methods. So while it may fit one style, it wouldn't be the first choice for my children's style of learning."
4,A good product,"This shaving cream provides a fine shave. I suspect the extravagant praise it garners is due as much to the snob appeal as to the product itself. Still, it is good enough that I would buy it again."
5,AWESOME!!!,"My husband absolutely LOVES this cream! And I don't mind it either! My husband has sensitive skin and had a difficult time finding the right shaving cream that did not irritate and had a nice scent, until he came across this product! Never again would he use something different. Thanks, Trufitt & Hill!!! :)"
2,P U,Can't get past the smell it smells like an old ladys perfume . the product worked well I tossed it in the trash after first use due to the nasty scent .My SWEDISH DREAM SEA SALT SOAP is awesome as a face soap and shave soap love the sea scent ...
5,Great Shaving Cream,"I have been using Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort shave cream for a couple of years and decided to try something different. 1805 shave cream has a nice fragrance and equally important, the shave cream lubricates the face perfectly when using a double edge razor. Highly recommended!"
5,Great product. Recommend it for all men.,"My husband always had skin problems with shaving creams that came in a can. Using this method of shaving and this product, no skin problems and the smoothest skin around! Smells great too!"
4,Excellent shaving cream,"This is an excellent shaving cream. The scent is very nice and the lather is rich and creamy, well worth the money when compared to the cheaper brands."
4,shaving cream,This is a product that I have used for many years. It works well and lathers up very easily. It alsohas a nice mild scent.
3,Sticky Gooey Green Stuff,"OK...so I'm a huge fan of the Truefitt and Hill Creams. I am totally in love with both 1805 and Grafton creams. This morning I tried Trafalgar and noticed while using it that it creates some sort of green slimy substance that was a consistency of corn syrup. It somewhat stuck to my face and was hard to rinse off. I suppose this is to create some sort of slick surface, but honestly it was not soapy/lathery as I've come to expect from their products and it turned me off.The scent as usual with their products was uniquely different and very nice but the the gooey green slime substance didn't win me over. I will spend my money next time towards Grafton. It's a real winner."
2,Not a bad way to end the series,"This series is close to an end and in a way I'm pretty grateful. While it was interesting, it could have been so much better in the hands of a stronge writer. The women have been strong and the men incredibly sexy. The problem is the uneven pacing. When the romantic time comes in the book it is rushed and extremly unromantic. The endings are too abrupt and many times confusing. What starts off as a bang usually ends with a whimper. Don't get me wrong,if you need a paranormal fix this book would calm your hunger pains but it won't sate your appetite."
3,A Disappointment,"This is nowhere as good as previous books in this series, which I enjoyed very much. I found this hero and heroine to be much too bland, who didn't live up to their colorful family backgrounds. I never felt like I got to know them very well (and maybe they weren't worth the effort). The long chase across the desert was singularly lacking in suspense. The appearance of characters from previous books felt like so many unnecessary cameos to me. In short, I had hoped for a flashier, meatier read from Melanie Jackson and was left feeling unfulfilled."
4,come se dice ????,"How do you say that in Italian? When you need a quick answer, this little pocket-sized volume can come to the rescue. Organized according to situation (politics, banks, music, souvenirs, even romance and dating), this compilation of phrases, vocab, and basic grammar is user friendly and practical. Tho it's hard for me to imagine having to say ""Spogliati"" to any of the Italians I meet (""take your clothes off""), if the need arises, I'll be prepared. Amusing in parts, portable, and broader in scope than most phrasebooks, you can't go wrong with this little personal assistant. Just remember to carry with you!"
5,Traditional heritage honored by elegant performance,"With the voice of an angel, Miss Zindarsian pays homage to her family and her Armenian heritage with this collection of seductive melodies. As a non-Armenian, and someone who enjoys owning very few recordings of soprano voice, I was caught off guard by the beauty of these songs, and even more so by the way she sculpts the melodic lines and lyrical phrases into an end result that is nothing short of captivating. The Armenian language is not as inherently musical as Latin or Italian, but in these recordings, the artist weaves the words in a delicate and graceful manner, enabling the audience to quite literally feel the authors' (including members of the Zindarsian family) love of their heritage, faith, and family. Magical talent revealing a magical people with a magical heart. Most recommended."
4,A touching story of a boy growing up in an Italian village.,"This book was written from the recollections of the author of his childhood before, during and after WWII. It is the touching, true story of the events both small and long lasting that made the author the person he is today. It has all the elements of a good story: humor, drama, action and sadness that this boy has experienced at such a young age. You will laugh out loud from the antics of his mother and neighbors and also experience the drama of his visit to the village ""witchdoctor"". The author takes you with him as he writes of watching his village and country succumb to the ravages of war. It is wonderful to experience the small things that brought joy, laughter and tears to this boy especially when in today's day and age, youthfulness and childhood seem to be disappearing. I highly recommend this book as it is a true joy to read and you will find yourself thinking of this story long after you have finished reading it."

5,AWESOME SELLER!,This item arrived very promptly and in excellent condition. It was a great gift for Father's Day!
5,Boss loved it....,Had everything needed toolwise to fish all in a compact case....great gift to your favorite fisherman...all together in a neat package...would definitely recommend.
4,"can,t order",I have tried many ways to order your grip 9 piece tool kit and it will not ship to my address.
5,This is the extra song on the singles (best of) cd.,3 brand new songs. I was lucky to pick up a copy. This is definitely a worthy addition to 12 memories and also includes a song sung by backup singer D. Payne.
4,Still running great almost 6 years later,"I bought this back in the beginning of '04 at the ridiculous price of $1199.99...you can get a 50"" Plasma cheaper today! Other than paying way too much back then I must say that 6 years later the LCD is still working perfectly fine with only 1 dead pixels. The only complaint I'd have now is that its not as bright as today's LCD monitors. I have a newer 20"" Dell set up right next to it and you can definitely see a brightness difference. I recommend this monitor if you can find it used for $50-60. Any more then that and you might as well buy a new widescreen LCD."
1,Wish I researched Samsung's replacement policy before buying,"Bought two of these monitors about two weeks ago. Both came with several dead pixels right next to each other forming an annoying blimp on the screen. Samsung agreed to replace both units. However, when the replacements arrived today, they turned out to be refurbished and with MUCH greater problems. One had a horrible color problem where one edge of the screen has one shade and the other another. Much worse when looked at from an angle. Another replacement was too dim even with brightness set to 100. Both refurbished monitors had many dead pixels. Apparently, this is acceptable to Samsung.Beware! Samsung will only replace with refurbished monitors, so if yours comes defective, you are out of luck trying to replace for a new unit.Needless to say, I will never buy Samsung again."
5,Absolutely AWESOME!,"I just got this LCD from CompUSA because of an awesome price.Installed it and it works absolutely great! The stand is adjustable. NO one talked about that in any reviews I've read--and I've read plenty--but it's indeed adjustable. From pictures, it looks like it's stuck at one position, but don't let that fool you. You can actually adjust the height. I can't say enough good things about this monitor. It's a dream come true."
3,Good reference guide but not up to date,"This book was written in the late 80's. Since then, a bunch of things have changed in Mexico (2001). Where there were dirt tracks now are highways, bus services have improved a lot and what is described as tiny-rough towns (in some cases only) are small ""full-serviced"" cities now. The maps contained in the book, as well as the road descriptions, should be used as a reference only. Check local web pages of the places you are interested visiting. MTB is becoming very popular (and growing fast) in Mexico and you will easily get information and tips from other ""ciclyng fans"" within the country. That will expand and give you info up to date of what is described in the book."
2,It's old.,"It needs to be updated, but can be helpful in planning a trip in Mexico. I used it for planning my bike trip from Merida to Punta Allen. There were a couple places where the route suggested was not as good as possible short cuts because of new roads. Hotel and restaurant list is no longer valid."
1,Did NOT fit.,This item would not snap in properly AND the buttons were jammed up so they could not be used.Very disappointed.
4,Very nice,"Purchased this set for my wife for Christmas, and we both really like it. The wood grain and finish are nice and are a lovely addition to our table. The pepper grinder works well, though I should point out that you don't have to turn it very much to get a good amount of pepper. Definitely don't go at it too vigorously unless you like a lot of pepper!Overall, the quality seems excellent, and it's an attractive set. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's a little more expensive than I would have expected, but as far as the product itself is concerned, I have no complaints."
5,Great Grinder,"Ever get frustrated with pepper grinders that jam and are hard to turn? Look no further. This grinder works like a dream on all settings, fine to coarse."
4,Good Belt Clip,"Since I have a bit of, shall we say, middle age spread, I thought this rounded belt clip would help keep my Treo 680 securely fastened at my side. Krusell has made another excellent slip for those with slim waists; unfortunately for those of us with middle age spread, it doesn't prevent the occasional slipping from the belt. I AM very impressed with the multidapt concept, so I'm trying other products of Krusell's. Highly recommend the concept."
1,WARNING: Please Read,"I really liked the concept of this product, but please be warned of the following: The product has a single holder for the wii remote, which then attaches to either the bat, golf club or tennis racket. The problem with this is that the holder connector to the sports equipment is very weak. The first time I used this product, I used the bat in the wii Sports baseball game. The bat has enough weight to it that it creates a breaking point at the remote holder's connection to the bat. Swinging the bat in the air, for one inning, caused the bat to break off the remote holder and fly into a wall, literally putting a hole in the wall. I am just glad it didn't fly into one of my children.This is a great product concept, but not tested thoroughly in terms of the stresses that would be put on the plastic components with normal use. Would love to see an improved version, and hope to get a refund on this one."
1,Fails to make te grade.,A waste. Limits the use of the Wii controller. Too difficult to take on and off. Bat broke shear off during a swing. Nice idea but does not make the grade.
1,its an awsome idea-the product is very poor quality,"During the baseball game, the bat totally snapped in half-luckily the remote was not damaged. An adult was playing the game, the baseball attachment was not struck-just the swing of the bat broke the attachment. Now the golf club and tennis racket are useless."
2,"Cute, but not necessary","My husband purchased these accessories to go with Wii Sports. They should have been made much larger. Especially the golf club! You get a child size version of a tennis racket, golf club and a baseball bat. The tennis racket helps you visualize what you need to do slightly better, but the baseball bat and golf club are just silly. Save your money and use it toward more games!"
3,Who knows?,"I can't really review this product because I never received it. I was notified that it had been returned and that my account would be credited. To date, the refund has not hit. I did go buy the pack at a store and if you've played golf, tennis & baseball with just the remote it will take some getting used to."
1,bad product,"This product is very bad, don't expend your money. Wii work very bad with this accesories"
2,"Great idea, poor follow through","Even though there is a lock on the bat, racket and club, they release when used... causing a bat, racket or club to go flying through the air. Not very good times when you have windows or a tv to the front or side of you. It's a great idea and lots of fun before they come unlocked. Would recommend purchasing a different version."
2,What you see is NOT what you get,"I purchased this product during one of Amazon's sales and received it on 10/3/07; however, the item is not what it appears to be. First, this is the 3-piece set, not the 4-piece set shown in the picture and as noted in the product description...it does not include the sword. If you want the sword, you will need to purchase the ""Ultimate"" set at 30 bucks. In addition, if you are looking for any meaningful assistance from Amazon Customer Service you will be even more disappointed. Their two suggested solutions were to contact the manufacturer to resolve the issue as it wasn't really their problem, or spend the extra money to purchase the set that I thought I was buying in the first place.The most disappointing part is that Amazon has done nothing to correct the listing, as of this date it still indicates this is a 4-piece set."
5,had a little 'situation',very pleased with the service. we had a little problem with one of the packs and PartsSearch took care of everything. Thank you.
1,First solo effort post Doobie Brothers,"Johnston's first solo outing contained what could have been a step beyong his Doobie's material. It has the same producer, loads of great sessionmen including Michael McDonald, Nicolette Larson, Bill Payne (Little Feat) Jim Keltner, the Tower of Power Horns and the Memphis Horns. There was one MAJOR problem with this album. The SONGS ARE NOT THERE. Plain and simple, you can add lush production and good musicianship, but if the songs aren't there, the songs aren't there. Johnston was trying for a more ""current"" sound. It failed. It was more like bad disco. For a better Johnston solo effort go to his next album Still Feels Good. Better songs, more ""doobie-ish"" material."
5,Very Good,"I am a Doobie Brothers fan so I'd buy pretty much anything related to them. I was disappointed when TJ left the band. Glad it was temporary! I saw him preform tunes from his solo stuff on TV years ago and at that time, hunted down this album and ""Still Feels Good"" and bought on vinyl (all that was around at the time). Finally I have just replaced those with CD's. Took some hunting again."
2,This Album Sucks!,"If you like the more rootsy sound of Johnston era Doobies,I doubt you would like this. Sounds very dated and nods to thedisco sound of the time it was recorded. The only reason it gets2 stars is that the musicians play this crap about as well as they can. I normally don't completely pan albums, but this just reminds me of how bad the state of rock was in the late seventies. This is a sour note in my record collection."
2,An average fantasy-type novel with few interesting moments,"Overall I was disappointed with this book, not because it was really bad (it's not), but rather because it wasn't nearly the great novel reviews here indicated. Most of the characters were somewhat trite and not especially interesting (and about as alien as left handed humans). The plot was linear, predictable, and slow moving. At times, the book read like a almanac (e.g., there was a population number given for virutally every city Valentine and his group passed through or near). This doesn't make for particularly exciting reading. Bottom line, it's the last Marjipoor story I'll read."
2,"Slow moving fantasy/sf ""epic""","This wasn't a really bad book, but it was disappointing because it didn't live up to some of the reviews I'd read. The characters were trite and frankly uninteresting (most of the non-human characters were about as ""alien"" as left handed humans). The plot was linear, predictable, and plodding. It might have been a page turner for me if I were a juggling buff or a psychologist specializing in dream analysis, but I'm neither so it was a chore to get through. The last Marjipoor book for me."
2,a struggle,"I picked up this book with high hopes based on the reviews but was uninspired by its text. Although the first 50 pages were interesting, the next 450 were a struggle to finish as the novelty of juggling (I'm a juggler) wore off and the plot became predictable. I would not recommend to those over fifteen."
4,Great Fantasy Read,"Having just finished this book, I am very much looking forward to continuing on in the series. I found this book to be very enjoyable, and to me it has more fantasy elements than sci-fi elements. This book is a little older and can be somewhat hard to find, but it is worth it if you can.The only thing I felt this novel was lacking was a little more description of history. Humans have been on the planet of Majipoor for 14.000 years or so, and there didn't seem to be many ruins, or descriptions of history other than former Coronals. But I still immensely enjoyed the story and would recommend it to any fantasy reader. The pace set by Silverberg is very good, I never felt bored during any of Valentine's adventures through Majipoor.This book would be great for adults and young adults alike. Enjoy!"
2,Simplistic,"After reading the other reviews i was stunned. I read this book years ago and although i am not avid SF reader found the book simplistic, unimaginative and predictable. Just my 2 cents. My favourite SF is Simmons 'Hyperion' and for a real good non-SF novel read Follets 'Pillars of the Earth'. B"
2,Good Gawd what a boring book!!!,"One thing I will say about this book is the author has some great imagination and this book seemed to be an excuse for him to get the fantastical creatures out of his system and onto paper. The ""hero"" is boring, passive, and only gets semi interesting when he is trying to reach his mother. The shapeshifters are creepy and virtually the only highlight in this dull dull book. There is a seamless blend of magic, medeval lifestyle, and advance technology, I just wish the author convince me to acutally care about the characters. If my brothers kept getting killed I would have ditched Valentine after couple chapters, I mean, what does it take for these people to get a freaking clue!?!?"
3,My Second Reading,"This book is a fantasy by one of the greatest living Science Fiction writers. In this it fails: that is is wordy; that it over uses devices like man eating plants and strange aliens.It has a good fairy tale plot of a prince who is unjustly deprived of his crownby magic ( science?). The treatment of Juggling has a pop culture ring to it.Dreams as sendings by amplified thoughts is also a popular genera.It is still a very good book, but I found myself skipping long very wordy discriptivepassages. But not as much as the first time I read it..."
5,A grand adventure of a man finding his rightful place!,"Valentine takes the challenge to be Coronal of Majipoor again, and in his time of exile he finds new friends and a lover. Valentine takes up juggling since he has no trade, but in the end he finds himself to be ruler of Majipoor! This is my favorite story, and must have read it about five or six times. A wonderful book for all ages including mine (13) Get it and read it!"
4,Most comprehensive how-to coloured pencil book I've seen,This is a pretty good book. I've never seen a better 'how-to' coloured pencil book then this one. Everything is so clear and understandable with lesson examples in the back of the book. If you want to learn colour pencil then I completely recommend this book. However as someone else pointed out. I feel that the images are a bit lacking. If anyone wants my advice - buy Bernard Poulin's book 'The Complete Colored Pencil Book' which has amazing imagery and this one for the know how. Between the two you'll probably never need to buy another book on this subject again.PS: The images shown on the 'look inside' feature of this site make the book look better then it is. The real images are a little more boring in my opinion.
3,A partial solution at best,"A better title for this book would be Color Pencil Solution Book for Realistic Still Life Drawing. People and animals have merely one or two appearances each among the examples, and land- and seascapes have no representation at all. It would have been an excellent reference to showcase multiple styles also, but we see only the work of the two authors, whose styles are very similar. The topics that are presented are well presented, and if realistic still life is your thing, this book will be a good resource. But if your interest is in multiple styles and landscapes or portraits, you'll often be looking elsewhere for solutions."
4,The Best 'Second Book' You Can Buy for Colored Pencil,"For a second book this is probably the best thing out there. Actual exercises applying the techniques are provided as opposed to merely providing samples of work. Also, the sections on composition are excellent, a great primer on things most books skip. I'm still looking for a 'First Book' though. I've purchased all of Bet Borgenson's publications but they just don't fit the bill so I'm slowly building a basic technique as I work thru this one."
4,Good book,"This book takes the serious beginning color pencil artist through setting up a studio, to the basics of composition and technique and through every step of creating a good picture from start to finish. It offers tips and solutions for ""painting"" everything from glass and metal to fruit and flowers. I've gotten many good tips from this book and recommend it."
5,Clear and concise,"This is my favorite book about colored pencils.It's packed with valuable tips and techniques, using solvents,gray and complementary color underpainting,reverse grisaille,working on colored surface anddifferent kinds of paper,vertical line technique,juxtaposing color,crosshatch etc...They show how to paint lace ( with using of solvents), drop of water, satin fabric, indian corn, peppers, plum, peaches, velvety rose (with pale geranium underpainting), day lily, silver, busket, reflection in water, fractured view in water and much more..I love beautiful works of authors. Take a look at work pictured old hands, making ravioli on p.51, garlic on p.68, cabbage on p.74... Color layers are so even, all works are air fresh, not overworked, technique is fantastic.Question and answers part is very helpful too.Beautiful addition to my library of colored pencils books."
2,There's gotta be something better than this...,"This book only lightly touches on each exam requirement; there is very little depth. It is especially weak in the topics of ADO.NET, security, and testing/debugging. To prepare for the exam, I rolled my eyes, muttered ""get it together, Microsoft"" under my breath, and just used this book as an outline.The bulk of my training came from the MSDN documentation, ""ADO.NET Core Reference"" (ISBN 0-7356-1423-7) by David Sceppa, and ""Programming Visual Basic .NET"" (ISBN 0-7356-1375-3) by Francesco Balena.Also, for practice exams, try www.BrainBench.com. They sometimes have promotions for free exams, and the questions are MUCH harder than the actual Microsoft exams (although the objectives are not the same)."
3,I expect better from Microsoft,"I took a MCSD cert training course that used this series of books. I felt that as the books were published by MS and the exams were written by MS that the book content could have covered the subject much better. I was taking the exams for C# and many of the examples do not compile, obviously the examples were originally written in VB and someone 'hacked' the C# routines without bothering to check that they compiled before publishing. I guess I don't care for books that cover material in both VB/C# for this very reason, we (C# people) would be better off purchasing a VB book and porting it ourself.I would suggest that you first take a look at the other exam cram books and study guides before using this series of books."
2,Needs supplements,"I just passed the C# and VB.NET tests. The C# test is the harder of the two. About 30% of the C# test is about ADO.NET. I would recommend an additional supplement in regards to data access objects. I passed the tests by memorizing this book and then using the internet to clarify topics that are poorly explained in the book or have typos in the examples (ADO, VB event handlers, command line params, component creation). Also, don't worry about the section concerning System.Drawing - I didn't see any graphics related questions on either test."
3,Not Quite All You Need,"I just took the test and I did manage to pass it. However, there were many items on the exam that were not covered adequately by the book (especially relating to .NET application security and ADO.NET). I would not rely on this as an exclusive source. Also, there were many errors I did manage to find in the book as I went. The most flagrant area for this was the ADO.NET chapter.If you do use this book, be sure to try everything."
3,A Mixed Bag,"I bought this book to study for the VB.NET exam - it's a mixed bag. If you're not already experienced in VB.NET (almost no one is at this point) you can't learn enough to pass the test by reading this book. It treats exam topics lightly.However, having said all that, there is some value in having all the exam topics outlined and presented in one place, even if much further study from other sources will be required.If I had it all to do again, I'd spend my money on other titles, using the study outline from Microsoft's certification web site for guidance. (I'm reading Francesco Balena's Programming Microsoft Visual Basic.NET right now, also from Microsoft Press. Balena's book is a winner!)"
3,Windows Application with C# & .NET,"I just passed C# exam. The book serves as a good introductory material and outlines the scope of test. However, you need to supplement it with other books. Write some code to gain proficiency in concepts. Most of the questions on the test are of ""problem solving"" type. If your concepts are clear, you should breeze through the test.Best of Luck."
3,Typical Microsoft Manuals,"If you are EXCELLENT at reading Japanese stereo instructions and can put together children's toys by following the instructions LETTER FOR LETTER, this set is a great resource.It is geared specifically at test passing. I bought the entire set, and have been writing VB code since 1993 and v3.0, and read through the first book. At that point, I paid $7175.00 to a training school (not a bootcamp, that's cheating) to learn how to use .NET right. Now that I have had a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer explain the ""Microsoft Lingo"" in real english, it all makes sense and I can read along with the book.However, if Chinese Long Division is not your cup of tea, I would suggest you start with something written in English!"
1,Rife with error,I strongly warn people not to buy this book. It is full of mistakes and statements that are just wrong. It is highly irresponsible of the publisher to allow such a poor quality book to be put out on the guise that it will prepare someone for a certification exam.
3,An introduction Book,Could someone publish a list of supplementary books necessary to pass the exam?ThanksMingming
3,Voucher not valid,"I tried to use the 15% discount in this book and was told by VUE that it IS NOT a valid voucher. The book itself was good, but does not cover some areas of VB.NET and C# in relation to SQL. The labs in the book are good, very few had to be debugged."
2,"Skim this book, then review from MSDN","The book and the associated practice test were inadaquate as study materials for the cert test. I passed the test, but only because I review the material on the MSDN website and perform labs if I am not doing the work on the job. Skim the book, then write your programs and study from Microsoft's site."
2,Not sufficient for the exam,"This book is not sufficent for taking 70-306, so many topics are not covered. Dont trust this and go to the exam with only this."
2,There are better books,"This book was useful only to pass the exam. I do not usually need it in my real life. There are also some incomplete lines of code in this book. If you are a beginner in visual studio, this book is useless. You won't understand anything.If you are an experienced C# user, this book will help you to pass the exam.This book includes a good set of questions. It includes 100 questions that will help you to pass the exam and many tips too.It would be great if this book included more labs and that it included all the topics required to pass the exam.I used the QUE book as my main reference book and this one as a complementary book. I passed the exam with 980/1000. If I haven't read this book, I would have passed with 900/1000.Some chapters are really shallow and many topics are not included in the book."
2,"Passed (70-306), but not because of this book....","This book did not contain nearly enough information to pass the exam, nor do I think it should. If you want to pass the exam, DEVELOP APPLICATIONS, and practice! To pass the exam you will need to be comfortable with all the topics covered in this book and expand your knowledge in each area using MSDN. The only real way to get a good grasp on the topics covered in this book is to use VB.NET and do a lot of coding.Nothing wrong with the content, but you will need much more to pass the exam. Code, code, code.....Good Luck!"
3,A reasonable starting point,"I passed 70-316 - but only after purchasing extra exam samples from MeasureUp (who are pretty good btw). If I'd gone straight into the exam thinking that the samples provided with the book were of the same difficulty as the real thing - I'd have failed. The book itself covers all the topics needed, but only in shallow detail. There are pointers to extra reading (mainly in MSDN help) which you'll need to follow to add meat to the books bones. Treat the book as an (expensive) overview rather than a comprehensive guide to the subject(s) in questions."
3,Need Pratice Test,I just passed the exam. THis book is notenough to prepare the exam. Many Items onthe exam are not covered by the book.You must take the practice test before go tothe test. I get a good package from Internet forone test voucher and 6 month test practice.and this help me pass the exam.
2,"Adequate outline, terrible coverage, terrible sample test","I have nearly a dozen books on .Net now. This is by far the worst .Net book I have bought. I haven't yet taken the exam yet so take my comments with a grain of salt. It is true what others say about this book. The coverage is very rushed. The software sample test totally blows! It hung up on me as the time expired. Can you believe that? Totally typical of Microsoft software! I spent 1.5 hrs going through the test exam and it freezes just as the time runs out. If the real exam freezes up on me when I take it, watch out!"
5,Great Book for Developers using VS .NET,"This is a great book for learning windows forms and VisualStudio.Net. The topics are taught in a concise and clear manner. The labs are well designed. It shows the author(s) has rich experiences on using VS.NET. Not like other .net books(using .net SDK) on the markets, this book teaches you how to get the job done in the RIGHT way. After working on a couple of chapters with the lab, my productivity increased! I wrote a widows form application in 40 minutes for a client that would take me at least 2 hours if I used VS6.0 and MFC. I found it is not only a good test preparation book but also a good reference for using VS.NET (MSDN is too huge, it is not easy to find the usage for VS.NET.). Highly recommend for developers who want to use .net technology in their job."
3,"Helpful, but...","We could not rely on this map for detailed directions. Also, turning it over to get from map to the directions was a pain.I don't regret buying it! Price was right and it was very helpful."
3,A Moderately helpful guide...,"I found this map of Vermont covered bridges only moderately helpful. The map has a symbol for covered bridges on it and directions to each bridge are located on the back of the map by region, along with a very brief history. I found having to flip the map over for directions very user unfriendly while trying to navigate."
3,"Not as good as his ealier books, too biased.","This is an important book about an important subject, but it fails to reach the high standards of his earlier work (such as the biography of Michael Collins). Its two major faults are that he talks about himself too much (who he has talked to etc) and that he fails to be a detached historian. He is consistently pro-Republican, an understandable viewpoint perhaps, but not good enough in a supposed history book. A telling feature is the ridiculously low profile given to Ulster's majority population, the Protestants. They appear only as faceless bigots or puppets of the British state. This is not just a Brit whinging, I was in Ireland when this book came out, and the Irish press found it equally hard to view this book as a balanced history. It is very hard to find impartial books on Irish history and this is not one of them. Read some Roy Foster as a counter-balance."
1,Unbelievably biased,"This book is so one-sided and biased that it loses the right to be termed a ""history book"" but is rather simply a Republican propaganda exercise by a man known to be totally prejudiced against the Unionist population in Ulster. A TOTAL waste of time and money. Embarrassing actually."
1,Pavarotti; Domingo;Carreras,"I don't need a thousand words for this review. I have purchased many, many books, CDs, video and DVDs over the past couple of years. This is the first time I have wasted my money. It was not because of the way the order was handled, purchased or shipped. It is because the CD is unusable and it was too late to send it back. The editing sounds like it had been pieced together with cellophane tape. I would suggest the seller take it off their shelves and return their supply for a refund. Short of that, I would not recommend this CD to anyone."
4,Great but not so great.,"Miriam is a joy to watch, but the elemination contest segment was a little not there. Why did they have an American in the matches is strange to me. She was great interrupting the bout to get the man to shut up. All in all I will buy this one for sure."
3,Wasted a good premise,"The movie starts with a good premise: Elkin Cheng works for an ad agency and organizes a Kung-Fu tournament to promote a health drink. In the process, he needs to recruit Miriam Yeung, the daughter of a Kung-Fu master, to enter the contest. However, the movie then turns into a trite plot of Elkin Cheng having two girl friends (his boss' daughter and Miriam) and trying to hide one from the other. The movie missed the opportunity to develop interesting, fun characters for the tournament's various Kung-Fu specialists. Instead, we get dumb characters who are only mildly amusing. SPOILER: Miriam finds out that Elkin is a two-timer, and channels her anger to win the tournament by imagining Elkin's face on her opponent. The DVD has Mandarin and Cantonese audio tracks, with Chinese and very poorly translated English subtitles."
4,Funny for Toddler and Mom,"I can't attest to whether this has made my 27 month old more interested in using the toilet or not, but he does enjoy the book. He laughs when he finds the poop and thinks it's really funny that the penguin poop is pink. I like that this book is about using a toilet and not a potty chair as my son quickly refused to use the potty chair and was only interested in the toilet. So few books emphasize using a toilet."
5,really fun read,This book has been so entertaining for my newly potty trained daughter and her older sister who loves reading it with her. They laugh hysterically at the end. My two year old was still resisting going poop in the potty and I believe this book helped to change her mind.
5,Absolutely helped my 2 year old go poop on the potty!,I never bother to leave feedback for items that I have purchased but this book really did help our daughter with potty training. She would rarely go poop on the potty until we started reading this book everyday. Somehow it clicked with her and now she ALWAYS goes on the potty! I love this book. Thank you!!
5,The most awesome book!,"Once I saw the name for this book I said to myself that this has to be a great book! So, asked my 2.5 year old daughter's grandparents to get it for her for Christmas. Let me just say, I love this book! Every page has a different seen with animals and their ""poop"" ending with a little one on the potty. My daughter loved this book so much that we had to read it to her over and over again. She walks around the housing saying ""i wanna read poop"" and then sits quietly to hear the story. I would recommend this book to anyone with a kid potty training as it shows that every animal also goes potty. Just be careful because you might laugh the whole time you are reading it!"
5,A Favorite,My little granddaughter is beginning to be potty trained. We read this book when she comes for a visit and she LOVES it. She has the last page memorized! I highly recommend this one.
4,A Great Potty Book,"This is an awesome potty book. It explains the mechanics of potty use, but in the eyes of a child. It is straight to the point, has beautiful illustrations, and encourages proper potty use. This book does a great job of encouraging a child to use the potty."
5,LOVE IT!,"Great book! My son has had this book for months and reads it every time he goes on the potty. He loves lifting the flaps, and ""reading"" the book. Definitely worth the money!"
2,This book was a miss for us,"This was one of the many potty training books I bought for my son. He had no interest in finding the animals poop whatsoever and I wouldn't consider this a potty training book at all. Basically just a flap book looking for poop all over the place. You definitely could not use this book to teach the concept of potty training on its own. As a supplement I guess its fine, but like I said, my toddler had no interest and much prefers reading other potty training books like ""Once Upon a Potty"""
2,"text too dumb, even for a toddler","The pictures are fine, and the windows to open are fun (and so far seem relatively sturdy). You have to make up your own story to go along with the text though, because the text provided is just so dumb. I'd be embarrassed to read it as printed to my 1 year old, and this is coming from someone who regularly makes up silly songs on silly topics to sing to the same 1 year old.The description suggested that the book shows how every little animal has a place to make their poop, but I struggle to find that message in the book. That said, it's possible to work around what the book lacks and make it relevant for toilet training. If all the other similar books are just as bad, which some reviews suggest, then this might be the best you can hope for."
5,Cute book,Book arrived in time promised and was in excellent condition. Looking forward to reading it with my grandson when he is ready for potty training.
2,It could be so much better.,"Children are interested in poop, especially at the potty-training stage. The idea of this book -- to show that all animals make poop - is a good one; however the delivery lacks creativity. With each animal there is an opportunity to search for the poop -- hence the book's title. There are lift-up flaps hiding various items on each two-page ""story"". Alas, the flaps are easily torn and -- the worst failure in my teacher's mind -- the poop is ALWAYS in the lower right corner of the spread. A lost opportunity to make the book more interactive and fun. I wouldn't recommend you spend your money on this book.Where's the Poop?"
5,Been a great help for potty training,"Okay, it's poop that we are talking about, so if you are squimish, then maybe you should pass. But this book is super cute with wonderful illustrations and lots of interesting things under the flaps so it's very engaging for my toddler. It has really help to clear the air when it comes to discussing poop and where you should find it- like in the potty! It has been a wonderful book to help potty training my daughter, so I happily give it 5 stars."
4,Flip up poop book,The book is cute with the story of finding the poop from behind select flip up sections on the pages
4,Fun,It is a nice book for my small children. They really enjoy lifting the flaps in each page. My only complaint is the binding. It is cheaply made and it wont last long in my household.
5,Great book,I was having a hard time getting my son to poop in the potty. This book was a hit! We were able to get him to use the potty on a regular basis just like the little boy in the book.
3,Daughter didn't 'love' it.,"I bought this for my daughter hoping it would encourage her to get more interested in the potty. She wasn't really that into the book (and she LOVES books!) I kept trying to get her to reread it, but she liked other books better. I, however,thought the book was really cute. Maybe when she gets a bit older she will like it (she is 2 1/2)."
2,Not sure why this is so liked,"I got this book with 3 others for my 18 month old son for potty training. This is not at all helpful with potty training. And is not a good choice for a 18 month old. It has a lot of small flats to revile images on the page which my son loves to grab and rip off. If you are looking for potty training books you are better off with ""Potty"" (by Leslie Patricelli board books)."
2,yay for poop!,"its bad enough your shopping for a book on poop, but now your reading a review on a book about poop.funny book. i think dad enjoys more than his 22 month old son. Ill keep reading to him"
4,Nice addition to my blade collection,"Knife is bigger than I thought it would be. At a 6"" blade this knife has me wondering how legal it is to open carry at the beach while fishing. Quality is good. The sheath can be broken down for cleaning by way of three cross head screws."
3,"A very nice book, but lacking in some areas.","Tintin and the World of Herge is a good book to get if you're a Tintin fan. The layout is very nice, with a short biography of Herge, and sections on each of the adventures, with rare pictures, sketches and even excerpts from the early black and white versions.However, this book does have some drawbacks. The commentary on the adventures themselves tends to be sketchy, and leaves something to be desired. Another thing that I also found annoying is the fact that all the excerpts from the Tintin books were in French, with no English translations. This is especially frustrating when looking at frames from the black and white versions, where I am unfamiliar with what the characters might be saying.All in all, while this is a good book, you would be better off buying Michael Farr's TINTIN: The Complete Companion, which has much of the same material as this book, while giving a lot more in-depth commentary"
4,A must for Tintin fans!,"This is an extremely thorough guide which tells the reader everything he/she would want to know about Hergé (real name Georges Remi) and Tintin (as well as Snowy, Captain Haddock, Prof. Calculus, Thomson & Thompson, Bianca Castafiore...). It encompasses the creator's life and then goes on to give a thorough description of each Tintin book in chronological order (including the first adventure, TINTIN IN THE LAND OF THE SOVIETS, which was never published in book form here; and the last, TINTIN AND ALPHA-ART, which was never completed). It is a very interesting book (although occasionally the wording is a little odd, as it has been somewhat awkwardly translated from French) and will certainly be enjoyed by fans of Tintin."
1,Love all the second-tier acts of 1995?,"This CD is so bad, I was personally insulted upon listening to it - it only gets one star because zero is not an option. Nominated for a Juno? What a joke! (This is, of course, the same organization that gives prizes to Celine Dion and Nickelback.) If you really, really, want to be transported back to the days when yawn-inducing third-wave grunge imitators ruled the earth, if you think that the disappearance of Stone Temple Pilots is a catastrophe rather than an act of mercy, this is the CD for you. If, however, you're actually interested in the many directions that music has moved in the last fifteen years, and you don't want to hear more of a style that was exhausted around the time Friends debuted on NBC, then look elsewhere."
4,Make time to enjoy this novel,"witty, charming, sexy and I agree with others, one of the best ofDodd's historical romance novels.Also recommend: ""A Secret Love"" by Stephanie Laurens and ""Damselin the Rough"" by Ann Mary Tempesta"
2,DOUGALD RUINS THE BOOK!!,"This would be a wonderful story, if not for Dougald!! How in the world could Christina (Dodd) imagine someone as intelligent and independent and free-spirited as Hannah being paired with a controlling pompous jackass like Dougald? From the beginning of the book, he is manipulative and controlling and not at all my idea of a romantic hero. He has no redeeming qualities. If I had been Hannah, I would have run away, too!! To give Ms. Dodd credit, I think this plot is more developed than her other books because we actually get to delve more into the governess's past and find out what lead her to the present point. Just some advice Ms. Dodd-if you get the chance to re-write this book, please change the hero or develop him into someone we can like. I would give this book 3 or 4 stars, but I was so damned mad at Dougald reading this book that I have given it 2 stars. At some point I actually wanted to burn the book because of Dougald."
2,Disappointment!,"I usually love Christina Dodd novels......but not this one. Dougald was absolutely one of the WORST ""heroes"" I've ever read about. He has a mean streak a mile wide - there is no redemption for him. I had a really hard time finishing this novel. The first novel in this series is so much better than this one.........."
3,It was Okay,"I liked the gothic nature of the story. And I liked Hannah best of all the governess of the ""governess"" series. I didn't find Dougald so terribly cruel. He certainly was softer than the Rosemary Rogers or Bertice Small heroes, for example. And the story should have worked for me. But it did seem to be missing something. The aunts and the tapestry story plot did get tiresome after a while."
3,Nice but nothing special,"This was my first Christina Dodd book. I chose one of her books based on other recommendations, especially one my one of my favorite authors. However, I was not particularly enchanted with this book; for me, it was mediocre. I liked the heroine, even though she seemed a tad weak-willed with regard to the hero. But the hero was not very likeable until near the middle of the book; in fact, he was often quite cruel verbally and emotionally. Even now, I'm not sure I'm entirely convinced of their love for each other (lust, yes; but love....).Dodd did an excellent job of keeping the reader in suspense about whom to trust and who's a villain. Unfortunately, one often wondered that about the hero. The book's style was interesting, and I will read another Christina Dodd, give her another chance. But this one isn't among the best I've read; I had little trouble putting it down."
4,A good light read,I didn't think Douglad was all that bad. This was the 19th century for crying out loud. I agree that you are putting 21st century values on a 19th century character. I guess I read these novels for a light easy escape and that is just what Christina Dodd gives me. I enjoyed this book very much and I in fact bought the rest of the rules series based on this book.
1,Run from this book!,"This may be one of the worse books I have ever attempted to read. And then I realized there are too many books out there that I will enjoy so I stopped about one third of the way through. I just could not take any more. The characters are so contrived, they do things that no normal human being in any time period would do. How is it possible that this woman was so straight-laced she was known for being stiff and she loses her mind for one good looking barbarian? Please! Why? He's rude, he's a chauvinist. The only possible reason would be his title, his money and possibly his children. This was absolutely a dreadful read and Christina Dodd has done so much better."
1,Not my favorite...,"I thought that Hannah should have punched Dougald in the gut and promptly left him...on her way out, she should have punched the butler for good measure!I got so frustrated with the way Dougald was behaving that I couldn't finish the book. I cursed him nine ways from Sunday, dog-eared the page and put it on a shelf.DO NOT let this bad rating stand in your way of reading other Christina Dodd books. I have read every single one and enjoyed them immensely!"
3,Dissapointing.....,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the other two books in this series, I was rather dissapointed with Hannah's story. Hannah is very independent, it was unthinkable to make her ""match"" with someone *that* stubborn. A little high-handedness is fine, but Dougald seemed much too imperious. In the previous two novels, Dodd made the heroes pigheaded, but also there was a limit. I really liked the old ladies. I thought that their work on the tapestry and all their little quirks made for a necessary relief from Dougald. Hannah is really a character to be enjoyed. Your heart aches for her history and you admire her attempts of independence. I think this book worth reading for the sake of the series, but I don't think it is especially worth keeping."
4,A great read!,"Loved this book, although I have to admit... hated the (anti-) hero Dougald for most of the book. He was such a jerk! BUT Ms. Dodd's ending brings it all together and we see how far he's grown. I now look back at him fondly!!! She's a master at witty, fresh, smart dialogue. She has a strong heroine in Hannah, and has us cheering her triumphs and choking up at her misfortunes. Again, her peripheral characters are strong and endearing. Her passionate scenes turn on the heat! I'd recommend this book for anyone who loves a wonderfully written historical romance that has a modern feel to it. This was a quick read for me."
3,Just Okay,"I thought this was going to be a good book because it started off well, but as it went on I sort of lost interest. I would rate it just average."
1,"Great Title, Not Much Else","Eat This Bug was a huge disappointment. It's main fault is that it contains very little detailed information. There are some nice pictures in this book, a list of insects that are suitable for feeding reptiles and amphibians and not much else. There is no discussion of reptile and amphibian nutrition, little information on how to care for your insects once you get them home, little or no information on culturing your own insects, and no information about the suitability of different insects as food for different reptiles and amphibians. The book is so simplistic, it seems to be written for children. It was a big waste of my time and money."
4,Best and only avialable on topic,"I found this book listed among recommend books on the Sithsonian Natural History Museum site. There are very few books on reptile care recommended by the Sithsonian. This was the only one dealing with live foods.It is a small book, only 62 pages. I would like to see an expanded version. I was unable to find the information I needed anywhere else. For anyone raising invertebrates and insects for feeding pets, this book will be very useful."
5,A video game that is educational,"I bought this game for my 14 year old son and he loves it. He is a history buff and loves video games. This game marries the two. The great thing is the game is affiliated with the History Channel and there is a lot of educational information tucked away in the game. Even for a child not interested in history, it's a great way to entertain and sneak in a few details about the sacrifices made in our country during very different times."
3,"its a game not the real thing, treat it as such",i read the reviews and bought the game anyway. i play games to have fun not to learn about history. its a game and treated as such its fun to play. i am not saying you should or should not buy this game on how much i liked it.go for it....its just a game.
2,Could have been a lot better...,The game play was not very good compared to Medal of Honor series or Call of Duty series. I attribute that to poor game programming. I was quite disappointed in the game overall. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
2,Am I missing something with this game?,"I guess I was confused when I bought this, but based on the description, shouldn't there be some kind of campaign mode? So far, and I admit I haven't played through all of the battles, it seems like a poorly-done, overly-simplified, super-easy, first-person-shooter with an extremely rigid linear play-through capacity.It says that you command full complements of troops of varying types across the battlefields. Um...where is that exactly? From the description I was expecting an advanced version of Star Wars Battlefront series. You know, a campaign game from each side, then an opportunity to fight whichever battles you wanted from different perspectives. I guess that would have taken more than the 37 minutes that they spent programming this though...On the plus side, for what it is (not much), it does provide some small amount of amusement."
2,this is a game to rent NOT to buy,"i am really in to the civil war. When i bought this game i thought it would be fun. i was mistaken, the game only has 12 missions none of which are easy, its like pulling teeth. The game doesn't save itself so if you forget for some reason your out of luck. Another thing is you only get to play one side of the battle. this is a game to rent NOT to buy."
4,Civil War Nation Divided,"Good game for my son, it was number one on his Christmas List. Unfortunately, he and two of his friends that also got this game have already beaten it. The graphics are great and the historical accuracy is unquestionable. Overall, a really nice addition to his Civil War collection."
1,"one of the poorest designed games made,","a disgrace that History channel lent their name to this piece of poorly designed garbage.The simplistic settings and small scale settings gave no indication of involvement on a grand scale war,rather a feeling of early video game simplistic development.Jim"
4,Fun but not great,"I bought this item thinking it would be awosome. It was fun I got lost on a level for about 15 mins tho so if your not good at finding your way be cautious. Also, historical acuracy isnt perfect. gatling gun is there befor the 1st battle that had one and im not shure about the other wepons. Alot of wepons. would not pay 40 bucks for it but 30 is a good price for it. Farly good grafics. Also cannon fire is way over done there is a cannon that hits near you ever 10 seconds way to rapid."
2,a rather dull experience,"I like history games. I like action games. I don't like action games made with a bare bones programming. The game is not entertaining. You spend the majority of the game shooting than hiding. After each shot, you get a smoke cloud that blocks your view and most of the enemies take a couple of shots to kill. Yet, your enemy, even on easy, have amazing accuracy with thier shooting. The civil war guns are known for being highly inaccurate. Overall, if you got to try it, just rent it."
2,History channel should be ashamed.,"Like many others I couldn't wait to play this game. After playing it I was kind of dissapointed. For one the types of weapons used in the game were not that common during the war its self. Secondly the solo man on a simple mission, give me a break. Thirdly the battleground should have had alot more bodies laying around. And last but not least only being able to play six missions as a confederate, and the other six as a YANKEE. To me playing as a yankee is like playing as a NAZI in a ww2 game. Where was the line battles, Where was the Cavalry Charges? First person shooter is great for ww2 and other modern warfare games, but not for the war between the states."
1,The description of the game is false advertisement,"Do not believe the description Amazon gives of this game. It's a blatant lie.""Control full compliments of troops and move them across the battlefield - cavalry, musketeers, riflemen and moreCommand cannons and mortars, build and take forts and experience 3D combat""1. You don't control any compliment of troops other than the one soldier you play as.2. You don't dig a trench, let alone build a fort.3. The ""3D combat"" might as well be 2D sidescrolling combat, because the game limits your movement so severely that you might as well be on rails.In addition, this game is grossly historically inaccurate. Other reviewers have already covered how, so I'll leave it at that. This game is atrocious."
3,For what it is.....,"I bought this at gamestop like 3 years ago, because I returned a game that didn't work, so I couldn't get money back, I had to pick another game from the store. I had seen it on the internet before so I was somewhat familiar with it. I really don't like 1st person shooters (3rd person shooters are much more fun) but it isn't that bad. Had I know it was 1st person, I wouldn't have bought it. It's very similar to Call of Duty in gameplay, just a little slower."
4,An interesting tale of misfortune,The story of Kaspar Hauser has many layers of evil tricks in it. It does a great job of presenting the corruption of wealth and power in the ruling families of old Germany. Poor Kaspar was really at the mercy of people with selfish and callous motives. In the end he meets a tragic fate.Well worth the time to watch this one indeed!
4,Nutra FX Get Big Chocolate Powder,"Great taste with milk, have drank less than three servings a day and still gained weight!"
2,An Ordinary Book,"The title of this one says it all...an ordinary white boy has what passes for marginal adventures of a disaffected youth in upstate New York...unfortunately, for Clarke Richard Russo rules this roost...and as result he is treading on heretofore explored territory and Clarke's prose and narrative are vanilla in comparison."
3,NOT IN LOVE....Too Heavy Chunky Tight,"This shoe is really narrow at the toe due to the tight weaving of the toe straps but maybe it's also because it's hot and humid here and my feet are swollen. So if you have wide feet get half a size bigger. The shoes are really heavy and look chunky. It won't look good with a skirt because it adds weight to your legs but I tried it on with jeans and it looked ok. I got the shoe in white but it's more like a winter white. It's not a bright, pure white. I'm glad I got these shoes on sale otherwise I wouldnt have kept them. I have other Charles by Charles David shoes and love them but these are just ok."
1,Sizing is wrong.,These shoes are more of a 5 than a 6. They are labeled as 6M but I even had an aunt who is 5 try them on and they were tight on her.
2,Not what i expected,"I might as well put a potatoe in my shake because this product does not even have that much carbs in it. It mixes horribly and it is really chalky. I guess its good that it fills you up, but i wouldn't buy it again."
5,Help For Lifes Frustrations,"Thank you for one of the best and most meaningful books, ""Soulful Living,"" that I have read in a long time. I make it a practice to read a section from this anthology each morning to better start my day.I have been increasingly more interested and intent on learning my life's purpose. Several selections seem to address the issues I am presently experiencing and have made me hopeful that I will soon bring resolution to some current frustrations."
3,Honeysuckle perhaps,Not the real thing. The fragrance of honeysuckle vine in the spring makes me oooh with pleasure. Not this. It's okay though.
4,a little too good,"like most people, i found the smell or fragrance does not last a long time. thats the draw back. the other side of the coin is how uncanny, spot on accurracy of the smell. We got honeysuckle and cant keep the bees away when wearing it!! Good looks and packaging and overall it hits the mark"
1,Problem at perfumery,"I ordered Demeter Honeysuckle as a gift and it arrived with half the cologne leaked out. I discovered that the problem was that the spray cap was not fastened on tightly. The person I spoke with at Amazon was very courteous, and a replacement was sent. Same problem, spray cap was not on tightly. Since only a little had leaked this time, I decided not to pursue it, but I will never order this by mail again. The problem is not Amazon, it is at the place where the cologne is bottled."
2,Disappointed,"I have been looking for a real honeysuckle fragrance for a long time. After reading the reviews on this one, I thought I had struck gold. The product just came today and, in my opinion, doesn't really smell like much of anything, other than alcohol. There is a faint, somewhat honeysuckle-ish fragrance under the alcohol odor. I have a honeysuckle vine in my yard & I love the smell of it when it is blooming and that's the fragrance I was expecting. This just misses the mark. Maybe the fragrance is just too faint to overpower the smell of alcohol (the first ingredient of this product). The fragrance also doesn't last very long at all. A couple of hours and it's gone. I'd send it back but between the postage both ways & the restocking fee it's just not worth it. What a disappointment."
1,Stay away from this unit!,"I have always paid to have my chains sharpened. The last two years have required more cutting and more sharpening. Having never bought a sharpener before, I figured, go with Northern since they have been a very solid company. While sharpening my 3rd chain, smoke developed from the motor and in seconds, the motor froze solid. Cheap motor, cheap unit. Wrote the company several times without a response. Not only did I lose $41 (shipping and the unit) but Northern lost me as a customer - over $29.95. Don't purchase this unit. You will be very disappointed."
1,I have bought many items from northern tool,I recently bought a Propane heater from this company and they dont STAND behind there name on ANY WARRANTY. ITS A DONOT BUY on any of there Products
1,Entertaining but inaccurate,"While this may be an entertaining book about US Presidents, it is inaccurate nonetheless. St. George states that no one of color has ever been President. While when she wrote this book that may have been true, it is now embarrassingly inaccurate. Also, she states that former President Bill Clinton was impeached and, curiously, omits that he was soon after acquitted. These inaccuracies leave the reader with misinformation. Luckily, I am a teacher and have taught my students to be critical readers - St. George's inaccuracies worry me for those who are not as critical and knowledgeable about the facts."
1,Insipid,"I find it hard to believe that this book won the Caldecott medal. It is a collection of random and useless facts about the presidency, presented in no particular order. The author tries so hard to be cute that she fails to provide any weight. While I agree there should be a book to introduce young children to the idea of the presidency, I hope a better one comes along soon."
1,Trivial Information of Little Value,"Trivia on the personal lives and interests of presidents is not what helps children learn or appreciate the office of the presidency. Children hear much about the president, whom ever he or she might be, and they deserve to know meaningful information about the office and the difficult demands of being the president of the United States.Trivial information does not humanize the president it makes the president appear silly and unimportant. While the children will laugh at what they read, the only thing that can be considered important about the book is that the children practice breaking the code to read the sentences. If that is all you want a child to gain from reading the book, this book will serve the purpose as will any book. If, however, you want to help a child understand the government, the need for qualified candidates, and the demands of public life, this book defeats your purposes entirely."
1,The pot calling the kettle black...,I find it to be an irony that the author high handedly cautions children not to lie like former President Bill Clinton did then goes on to lie to them that he was impeached. President Clinton was NOT impeached. To try and manipulate young minds based on her own political leanings no matter what they are is unconscionable and pathetic. She should teach history but leave the parents to do the rest as she is obviously very unqualified. I can only hope that the author doesn't have offspring of her own. I am personally making sure this offensive book is brought to the attention of every teacher at my child's school and my local public library to request that it by removed from the shelves. I suggest reprinting with the truth this time - something we should all espouse - perhaps Ms. St. George could look to the page on Lincoln to get a clue.
4,Compare and contrast the presidents,"This book briefly explains how the presidents were similar and different, while using caricatures for pictures. For instance, it tells children that many of the presidents had the same first names, and that several had a relative who was president. I wouldn't use it as a book for teaching about individual presidents. It basically explains some of the elements that might have influenced the public to vote for a particular president. My son loves the title, but isn't thrilled with the content. I would also recommend it as a primary book rather than one for older children."
4,So you want to be president,"Firstly I think you should read the book So You Want To Be President because it's a funny informing book.Here are some good things about being president: If you are the president you are going to have a swimming pool, bowling alley, and a movie theatre. The President never has to take out the garbage. In the book there is a story about George H.W. Bush. As a boy George had to eat broccoli. When he grew up, He became president. That was the end of broccoli. Presidents don't have to eat yucky veggies.Here are some bad things about being President: You have to wear lots of clothing. One of the president named William McKinley wore a frock coat, vest, pin striped trousers, stiff white t-shirt, black satin tie, gloves in his button hole everyday! Another thing is that you have to be polite. And you have lots and lots of homework!I think you should read this book because it tells you lots of facts and some are funny and some are serious."
5,Excellent Book! Highly recommend,"Excellent book to learn about the presidents and the presidency. We are reading it now in preparation for Presidents Day. Also, another poster stated that President Clinton was not impeached. Sorry, but he was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998. For information on this, check out www.whitehouse.gov."
5,Caldecott Medal Winner,Hurrah for David Small! The illustrator for this book has just been named the Caldecott Medal winner for this year. I've always been a David Small fan. If you want to see an example of one of his very best books (even better than this one) I suggest The Gardener by Sarah Stewart.
2,RTF Disappointment,"I've always been a big fan of rockets with parasite gliders, but this one leaves me cold. The rocket itself isn't bad for a ready to fly kit, but the attached gliders are made mostly of cheesy foam and are inpossible to keep properly trimmed. I guess it might be fun if you like to launch rockets then watch gliders flutter to the ground like dead leaves, but I've got other ideas. This kits sole redeeming quality is the nose cone, which can be scavenged and used to build several other classic Estes kits. If you see it cheap, it might be worth your while, but overall the Shuttle Xpress is a disappointment."
2,Rockateer,"I have built and flown many models of rocket, but I find that this one was the worst. The design looks cool: The nose cone is amazing and can be used on other rockets if one choses to do so. The gliders on the side are not durable(the wings are kept on with double stick tape) and one the rocket is airborne, the gliders and hard to keep track of and get lost easily. I would NOT get this product because Estes makes many fine rockets other than this one."
5,Grande disco do Baro,"Este é um dos grandes discos do Rock Brasileiro, esquecido pela crítica e pouco tocado nas rádios. Acho que o BV é uma das maiores bandas brasileiras de rock e esse disco é a prova. Rocks como Dignidade, Amor de irmo e Contraveno tm muita pegada e contrastam com as baladas blues de Frejat, cá pra nós uma melhor do que a outra, Quem me olha só, Me acalmo e me desespero e Completamente nova matam a pau. Recomendo!!!"
5,Powerful and Fast,"I just bought my third set of these rechargable batteries. These are amazing. They charge fast and really have a lot of power -- very unlike the Energizer rechargables that I bought which totaly aren't worth the money. I've thrown those away already; I have 2 of these batteries in my toothbrush. They will run the brush for almost 3 months before needing another charge. My daughter and husband went to Washington DC recently so I bought the really expensive lithium batteries so they would have plenty of power for the digital camera. Those ran out of power by the end of the first day; my husband put in these trusty rechargables that I sent along as spares (just in case); they lasted the rest of the week, and still had plenty of power to spare.I can't say enough good things about these batteries -- buy extras, you'll love'em!"
4,AMPAD Composition pad,"I have used these as daily record books since we were assigned to buy them for college courses in 1961. They are spiral-bound, lie flat, are page-numbered and graph-ruled. You can tape an 8 1/2 x 11 page in them and not have it hang over the edges, if you want.They're getting expensive..."
4,Expensive but industructable,"I have had one of these notebooks for 4 years and in that time it has had water spilled on it umpteen times, crushed, bent, thrown, etc and I think I have lost only 1 page. Only worth the money if you A. really treasure what you are going to write in your notebook, or B. the notebook is going to take major abuse."
4,"Great, but pricey","I love these computation books. I've used them in my job as a project manager for 8 years. They hold up to severe punishment and come back asking for more. The only downside is the price. For less than half their cost, you can get a pad made by Cambridge that will also get the job done. My employer quit purchasing these pads to save money, so now I am going down the cheaper, not as nice Cambridge path."
4,Art of Native American Flutes,"While this is a great book written by one of the best flute players in the world it is not really a beginners book. It does go into great detail about writing Native American flute music in tabulature form. It also has quite a lot of sheet music and other interesting items and a rather extensive chapter about all of R Carlos Nakai's music releases, which gave me a few ideas for my next few flute music purchases"
5,Great!,This book is very special. It's definitely for more advanced players of the native american flute. But it's very clear and interesting and has some very beautiful and inspiring music to learn.
2,Leaking Bottom,"received knock box. The stainless look is very nice. However, knock box is made with two pieces of Stainless. The bottom is not sealed. If you dump more than four espresso shot grounds the water left in the brewed espresso leaks out.The rubber base does keep it from leaking out onto your counter. however, i am disappointed that the seam of the two pieces of the stainless were not sealed."
4,great value knock box,"The knockbox is rather cheap compared to others I have seen. It is an excellent value though as the others I've seen are very over priced. The base ads an incredible convenience as their tamper, sold separately, fits the base perfectly. The small size fills quickly but encourages regular emptying."
4,works as it should and looks great except the price...,Can be cheaper but it works great and good placement for the temper. I used it vertically instead of horizontally next to my espresso setup.
5,Excellent Northern Michigan Read!,"Deadstream is an incredibly well-written, engaging novel that I literally could not put down. Brad Platt did amazing research of Northern Michigan to include accurate places and events. He captured my attention from page one and held it throughout the entire book. This book is truly entertaining, interesting, alluring, and surprising. I really hope he comes out with a sequel!"
5,Age Old Human Drama With a New Twist in the Northwoods,"A great read by a new author, set in the north country. A captivating book with plenty of action and mystery with a new twist."
2,OK but repetitive,"This book is great about encouraging you to exercise during pregnancy. However, I think it's geared more for those that do not normally exercise. I was hoping to get more specific exercises out of it. There are a number of stretches and exercises, but if you are already athletic, you probably won't gain anything new from this book. I found it very repetitive. For example nearly the same paragraph for squats is printed in four places: the chapter on the first trimester, second trimester, third trimester, and leg exercises. When the book first arrived, I thought it would be great, but the information could have been covered in about 1/4 of the pages."
5,Story for the Soul,"Citadel of Cynosure & Other Tales is a genius work of love that tells a story set to music that enchants the mind and scintillates the soul. A well blended symphony of lush sound, empowering lyrics, and music that makes you delve deeper into your self as you are taken on a journey you won't forget. Each time I listen to it I find another adventure to take my spirit to another level. I strongly recommend it!"
4,ProgRock Purity,I've been a big fan of ProgRock all my life and This is one of my favorites. This album contains a varity of styles all with a solid ProgRock base. The songs are from the heart...to the heart.
1,To be blunt: HORRIBLE,"Oh my God! I can't believe this piece of **** is even listed here. I saw these guys at Progfest in '93, and I felt embarrassed to be a progressive fan by the end of the show. These guys outdid Spinal Tap and the sad thing is that they were actually SERIOUS.This group were capable musicians, but this album sounded like a 12 year-old's concept of what progressive rock is supposed to be. This album is loaded with HORRIBLE fantasy lyrics and unbelievably cliche' musical passages.Hopefully this is long out of print and impossible to find these days."
2,Not like Claim Jumper,"Claim Jumper restaurants use Helen Grace's Fudge Topping on their Mud Pie dessert. I had this dessert recently and liked the fudge accent so well I decided to buy some. Unfortunately, my experience at home was that the Fudge Topping out of the jar tastes different from the topping at the restaurant, it's far sweeter out of the jar. It also seemed to be of a different consistency. The Fudge Topping out of the jar, even though it started out warm and smooth, froze instantly into unappetizing globs on top of the ice cream. I'm not sure what the explanation is for these differences, although I suspect Claim Jumper somehow tweaks the topping before serving it. At Claim Jumper on top of their Mud Pie, it's fabulous, but at home, out of the jar, this topping was a disappointment. Helen Grace does offer refunds though and their customer service is excellent, and that's why I gave them two stars."
4,Loved your book,"I loved your book. I think I read it in about 3 hours. I simply could not put it down. I tried, but kept picking it back up. It was fast paced with very little ""dead-time"". It's hard to not have dead-time during the plot building portions.I especially liked your visual descriptions. Since I cannot hear, I am a very visual person and I see or notice things that most people don't see. You see things like I do, noticing all kinds of little details. I could ""see"" the whole story. I felt like I was there, watching it all happen. Sometimes I felt like I could even smell the scenery. You're very good at that.I look forward to reading your next book. I assume you are working on something. I suspect you would have a hard time being quiet with the pen."
5,Strap yourself in...,"Espionage, suspense, action, and adventure. Strap yourself in when you begin Rogue: The Cheetah Files by Robert Walker. Set against a backdrop of Tyrolian Alps, Texas honkytonks and Mayan jungles, this thriller will grab your attention from the start and keep those pages turning.Suprising plot twists and complex characters usher you through this web of intrigue as you try to distinguish villain from hero. Be warned: Things are not necessarily as they seem.With his first book, Mr. Walker has struck a note that will be hard to follow. Nevertheless, we look forward to soon seeing more of the Cheetah Files."
5,An Excellent Read...,"Cheetah Files was a great escape, with the perfect mix of action and character development. I love to read but have limited time, and I am constantly frustrated by the lack of quality action/intrigue books there are out there. Cheetah Files was quite a breath of fresh air amid so many canned storylines, kudos to Mr. Walker - I can't wait for the next one!"
5,A Good Purchase,"I think this would be a great beginner's book for anyone trying bottleneck blues for the first time (like myself). I am finding the given exercises and songs easy enough for a beginner, but challenging enough to not get bored with. Note that the songs are played using Open G and Open D tunings if that matters to you. Songs are clearly written out in tab format, with standard notation above.Thanks Woody, for putting together a solid book."
5,Great slide book,"I found the book to be very helpful, and full of great information about slide players and their music. So far it has been easy to read and understand, but I have had help. I am currently taking lessons and my instructor is using this book as one of the resources to teach me slide. I am not sure if I would have the same understanding if I was trying this alone. The books takes you step by step through the concepts of the blues and slide guitar. I feel it has been well worth the price."
1,25 Guitar Favorites,"This CD is awful. It is not what I expected at all. If you are looking for music with guitar solos, this CD is not for you."
5,Awesome Read!,I just finished Mayan Mars on the recommendation of a friend and it was excellent!I couldn't put it down!
5,Antique civilization,"Amazing book. The most intersting topic was the capacity of the author to connect the history of an old civilization with a modern science situation. In this manner, we can feel the possibility of the history becomes true."
4,Informative,"The subject was intriguing and overall the video is informative, but the production itself is uneven, abruptly weaving in interviews with the historical docu-drama portion of the story."
1,Misrepresentation,"DON'T order from this seller!!!!I bought this bride thinking it was coming with it's groom. I was shocked and more than a little irritated to find that I had paid $34.00 for only a bride. Whole wedding ruined? Not likely. A waste of money? Yes!!FYI seller:Perhaps the picture of the item should match the description for those of us that multi-task and don't have time to read the fine print.Just to clear things up, I give 0 STARS, you jerk!"
4,Not long enough.,"Great cord, heavy and durable material, should last a long time. But, it needs to be 6-8 feet instead of 4 to work for a stackable dryer."
4,Sea Salt,"Nice flavor, lower sodium than regular table salt. Works well in recipes, and on grilled or broiled meat."
4,So many ways to make music!,There are so many ways to make music!These artists are Wonderful to watch and listen to!Give it a try!
1,"Poorly researched, poorly written, poorly edited","I've read this book and found it to have many errors of fact. The basis of the humour depends on trust in the author that the historical accounts he describes are actually correct. Once you lose faith in the historical correctness of the book, as I did, it has nothing to offer, not even humour.The author and publisher should have provided references for all the events described - the credibility of the book depends on it! If this author had made the effort to find and document references for all the facts, it would have been a much more interesting, satisfying -- and funny -- read."
2,Encyclopedia Idiotica indeed!,"On page 110 the Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated on June 25, 1914. On page 113 he was assassinated on June 18, 1914. All other history books give the date as June 28, 1914 and cite this as the beginning of World War I.The entertaining style makes it worth 2 stars as long as you take it with a hefty dose of salt."
3,Brief and Amusing,"This book is an amusing rendition of various acts of idiocy through history. Stephen Weir begins with Adam and Eve, who he regards as the original idiots, and finishes with the Boxing Day tsunami and the complete absence of warning of the impending catastrophe. In between, the reader is given a synopsis of, amongst other events, the burning of Rome, the Boston tea party, Gallipoli, the Great Leap Forward and Jonestown. This is truly an eclectic list!It should be stressed that at no time does this book dig deep. All the various events covered are glossed over in a few pages. It is history at its most brief. Perhaps this is fine for the internet generation. I found it somewhat annoying. Analysis is disregarded in favour of the minimum of basic details. Yet, when covering such a great swathe of events, it is probably inevitable.As a holiday type read, the book is fine. As anything deeper, it fails."
4,"Fun to read, in bite size ""snippets""","The author presents a wide ranging array of ""idiots"" from Menelaus to Churchill to others less well known. Each ""idiot"" or idiotic incident is giving a few pages, and cleverly categorized by which sin or virtue is appropriate. Even though I read many history works on European history, I still learned a few things. It's a bit breezy for a serious approach, but that's not the author's intent. It might work well as a supplemental work in a lower level course, especially in adding one's own idiot's, debating his choices and coverage of it.Overall, a fun book! Historically accurate as far as I could tell, but I did disagree with some of his choices, and would have added others (Nixon just begs for this) - but it simply shows his perspective, and he obviously wanted to cover at least a few lesser known lessons from history, and to his credit, doesn't catalog the common golems of the left or right.A wonderful bedtime reading book!"
1,Way too easy on Montezuma and his mexica,Montezuma and co. were cannibals. Yes eaters of actual human beings they were. Yet author Stephen Weir never actually mentions that in his description of the mexica and aztec society whom Cortez defeated in the early 1500's. Weir writes like it is actually a shame the Aztecs fell. Deranged writing if I ever saw it!
4,A well-produced classical variety album,"This album could have easily been filled with selections just from Bach, Mozart, Vivaldi, and Beethoven, but thankfully the record producers chose some deeper cuts. Though the above mentioned greats are prominently featured (and rightly so), Grieg and Offenbach are welcome additions.Like all the ""25 _____ Favorites"" albums I've listened to, the pieces are well-chosen, expertly performed, and excellently produced with sharp, clear sound. The album's variety is welcome as well, giving the listener 70+ minutes of a changing but continuous audio landscape.There's not much here that will knock the socks off a classical purist, but that's part of its appeal. The pieces are good enough to satisfy the more refined classical music palate but accessible enough for those less-experienced in concertos. 25 CONCERTO FAVORITES comes recommended to those seeking a well-produced and pleasant classical variety album."
4,Not as good as personal coaching but pretty good anyway,"Written by a vocal coach who has worked with the likes of Axl Rose and Colin Hay, Strengthen Your Singing Voice shares her techniques and thoughts on how to sing without experiencing voice fatigue as well as how to build a stronger, powerful voice. The book includes a CD that demonstrates some of the lessons and warm-up exercises which is very helpful. With a good education on how the vocal cords and diaphragm work together to produce sound as well as how to care for them properly, sing without damaging them, and a lot of other important information. Includes a section on breathing that I wish more singers would learn - how to breath without making breathing sounds. While nothing replaces one-on-one teaching between a student and teacher, Strengthening Your Singing Voice is a reasonable alternative and recommended."
3,Different Audio!,"the video is the same as the VHS version, and still fantastic, but the audio score is different, and is positively dreadful."
2,Good stuff bad package,"The cd has a great collection of music an elder gent friend loves , but it arrived cracked and I had to take a chance and give it to him anyway, as there was not time to exchange before the holidays. Thankfully it works fine and we replaced the clear plastic case, but that is not a good way to do business."
3,I agree,"I don't actually own the above CD...BUT I agree with the previous reviewer about N. Herlea...A baritone to die for... Radiant Top notes, unbelievable stamina...and sumptuous texture/timbre...he did sing in the West, but unfortunately was pretty much ""kept"" behind the iron curtain...He has (although hard to find) recordings of Tosca, Forza, Rigoletto, and Barbier as well... listen to this guy...(he is definitely in the league of Bastianini, Zancanaro, Tagliabue,Capucilli and co...- if not, BETTER)"
1,U can get it for cheaper,THis is a great toy candy BUT in Rite-Aid or other stores u can get it for $2.99SO dont over pay online!
4,Good stuff,"Silicone oil as silicone oil... I'd give it 5 stars, but can you fall in love with a bottle of silicone oil?"
2,poor sound quality,"a great selection of baroque favorites, but the sound quality, especially on the pachelbel canon, not great at all. for that reason, i cannot recommend getting it. what do you expect for five dollars, right !>? i would suggest spending a little more money and getting something that you can't bear to part with, for continued listening enjoyment."
4,Good stuff...,"I bought this album a number of years ago and always enjoy listening to it. You really can't go wrong with an album that begins with Pachelbel's ""Canon"" and ends with Clarke's ""Trumpet Voluntary."" Also included are works by Handel, Bach, Vivaldi and many other lesser known Baroque composers. Almost all of the works that were chosen are true classics. The performances are stellar. When I need some beautiful music to calm my spirit or provide a backdrop when I'm reading, this album is perfect. It's not remarkable enough to earn 5 stars, but I'm happy to recommend it to anyone, especially at such a reasonable price."
2,broken cd case,"I was disappointed when this cd arrived. the case was broken. I was not about to pay for the return, so I just kept it.....disappointing."
5,tim rose a kind of love hate story,if you are a fan of tim's music from the 70's then buy it. not for everyone.band mates from spooky tooth help out.bryson graham's drum work is the best.
3,It would be awesome if it were....awesome. Which it's not.,"This small, practical bag would work well as a messenger-bag-style purse, except it doesn't fit over your torso (cross-wise) as it would appear to in the description. The strap at its longest it pathetically short...I have a tiny torso, and the purse is closer to my armpit than to my hip. I used it once and now it's going to go live in the closet. It would work well as a tote-style bag, or for someone who prefers to wear the bag higher up, but do not buy this with the intention of wearing it on your hip: it won't work.Also note: if you're an organization freak like I am, this bag has only the two small exterior pockets with no internal pockets or divisions. It's a simple, cute bag but not what I was hoping for."
2,The entire discription listed is WRONG,"The description states it is 11.5"" x 8.5"" x 4"". The perfect size I needed. It's not. It's actually 9"" x 7.5"" x 2.75"" It also claims to have an interior dividor, which it does not. THERE ARE NO INTERIOR POCKETS ON THIS BAG. Just the 2 impossibly tiny ones on the outside. They could possibly hold a small cell phone, but that would be it. The inside is just one space.The condition oft he bag is brand new and it's a nice bag. Just not at all what the description of picture depicts. DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU'RE EXPECTING WHAT THE PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION SHOWS."
4,"Easy to use. Simple for parents, teachers, mentors.","This workbook is a fine follow up to the original book. The exercises are easy to do and challenge the reader to not only reflect on their boys' lives but to look at their own upbringing and attitudes.The workbook is filled with easy to understand problem-solving checklists. Although helping a child or teen modify his behavior can not be reduced to a simple ""to do"" list, the book provides good fodder for thought, reflection and action. Great starting point for anyone involved in a young man's life."
4,A pretty good read,"Libby Conners meet Dan Lukens on the eve of attack of Pearl Harbor. Dan and Libby fall in love. After the attack Dan ends up prisioner of war in the Philippines and then in Japan and Libby serving in the Wasps. Dan and Libby are apart and they must rely on their faith that they will be together when the war is over.""Dawn Of A Thousand Nights"" by Tracia Goyer is moving story of faith in the darkestbhours of war. It clear that Ms. Goyer did her reseacher in the conditions that soldiers faced. Overall I really enjoyed ""Dawn of a Thousand Nights"" and would be good read for any who enjoyes wartime fiction."
4,Analysis of Philosophical and Religious Issues,"I use this text in my intro level religion classes. It's not a world religions text however. The book is organized thematically, which can be confusing for non-linear thinkers. For example, if the topic is ""religious experience"" the text will compare various texts (primary and secondary) from different traditions. Consequently, one can see the similarities and difference between various religious traditions. It's a rather postmodern religious studies text.At the same time, that may be its weakness. I usually recommend that students have already taken world religions prior to the class where we read this book. It can be a great springboard for discussion and other projects. However for students who don't know much about religion and philosophy (or history, etc) the text may prove a bit superficial. On the other hand, because of how it's organized there is usually something that everyone can relate to."
3,not a bad intro,"I feel I learned a lot by reading this book. Keep in mind it's just an introduction to religion. If you want in-depth exposure to a religion or an aspect of the study of religion, you will need to go to other sources."
3,fair,"While the book does present an accurate and unbiased view of world religions, the text itself is less than gripping (the writing is dry), and the book's organization is a little confusing. This may not be the best text to use if you are interested in getting a clear, overall picutre of a particular religion. It includes studies of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam."
4,"Emerson, as usual, Great!",What Steve Emerson writes in this book is amazing.I just finished Emerson's American Jihad: The Terrorists Living Among Us and am now his biggest fan.
2,hardly a ghost story,"This is another one of those movies I wish I hadn`t wasted my time with. It`s supposed to be a ghost story, eerie, chilling and spine-tingling according to the jacket. I found it to be none of those. It has very little to do with ghosts and more to do with a rather boring love triangle and a man who is learning to deal with the death of his wife. The musical score is pleasant at first, but then becomes monotonous. The photograhy is too dark and what is shown of Ireland doesn`t really come across. The dark photography and music create a somber mood that is more conducive to going to sleep rather than being eerie. It`s an Irish film that may have won some awards there, but it didn`t appeal to this American."
2,What was the point?,"I give two stars here only for the soundtrack and for Ciaran Hinds.As for the rest, it really isn't a ghost story. It's a narrative mess, muddled and confusing, with the focus taken off of the main character and given to two others whose story is not interesting.Too bad it was so pointless. It could have been much better."
4,The Eclipse,"I liked it.......................... I don't get paid for this. This is why most people don't bother to review anything. If you don't know me, why do you care what I like? The Eclipse"
3,MY VIEW WAS ECLIPSED,MOVIE WAS JUST OKAY. DIDN'T LIKE IT WELL ENOUGH TO KEEP IT AND WATCH IT AGAIN AT A LATER DATE.
1,Should Have Been a Total Eclipse,"There is no mystery in this movie what so ever; there are no ghosts; there is nothing supernatural. Just ignorance. Everyone has lost someone that they love but to randomly toss in a couple of fakey slightly scarred head shots in spots that make no sense (e.g. in the car seat next to you; under some stuff in a room) or a couple of brief ghostly apparition scenes lasting a few seconds that do nothing - please! That any of these mysteries are part of illusionary compensation for losing someone is beyond belief. Also, to intermingle and confuse the one story line with another with an artificial good guy - bad guy - cute girl love triangle seems to be added to appease a certain viewing demographic but has no other function in this supposedly ""spine-tinglingly"" supernatural thriller.Finally, what does an eclipse have to do with the fundamental plot/story of the movie?"
1,Slowest movie I ever saw!!!!,5 of us sat down to watch this movie after receiving it. It was the slowest movie I ever saw!!!
2,Very average to below average film,"""THE ECLIPSE"" is filled with hype, and doesn't meet the expectations of being a 3,4, or 5 star motion picture. The film (optics) is very dark, using too much contrast for a high quality motion picture. The story is okay, but only has a few places where you might feel some chills from a few ghosts. With all the money that these films make, you would think that we would have hundreds of motion pictures coming out at the Theaters every week, but instead, we have only a few, which means that we don't see a great film too often. In this regard, THE ECLIPSE movie is slow, acting is good, but the story-line is dreary and depressing, the ending is a dud. If you looking to watch a film that has some great haunting chills, this is not the one for you. Rent a chiller, like in the film, DRAG ME TO HELL, if you want to be scared and filled with ""wow, that was a fantastic scary motion picture!"""
1,"Really STINKS!!!!!! No plot, just sucks. Pleas don't waste your money.",Please don't Waste your money! The Movie SUCKS! I'm a horror and Sci-Fi nut. This movie has no plot or scheme. I turned it off after an hour. What waste of my time.
4,Engrossing Film About Loose Ends,"I did not know what to expect from The Eclipse and was surprised to find myself involved in the characters, even the annoying ones (Aiden Quinn). What could possibly recommend a film more than that?Not expecting the unexpected, I was genuinely creeped out at least twice, something I haven't ""enjoyed"" in many years. I suppose that's the beauty of not knowing what you're getting into. Thankfully, shocking the audience is not what this film is about.The Eclipse is for adults in the sense that adults tend to be more interested in character development and relationship dynamics, both of which are here beautifully realized by committed performances. Also, it does not sensationalize, being rather discrete about the supernatural elements the intrude, almost gratuitously, into the plot.I'm happy to recommend this well-wrought drama that does what good entertainment ought to do--transport."
5,"Great Great Movie, Raining Atmosphere & Chills","Just watched the movie last night and loved it. Great, great atmosphere. Never thought the story would come together but it did just fine. Loved the ending. If you love movies, you will love this movie. Not for those Twilight idiots who wrote reviews bringing this movie down because they didn't receive the piece of crap they thought they ordered. Man am I ready for a comet to hit, what happened to Earths gene pool?"
2,Ridiculous,"I adore The Weavers, but Vanguard Visionaries is an extraordinarily disappointing series, given that the label is being so stingy with its offerings. The label has an excellent roster. If they wanted to publicise their archives, they could have been a great deal more generous at this price - or else offered it for $6 or so. It's also disappointing that Vanguard is ignoring some of the wonderful stuff in its archives and focusing instead on meaningless releases of this variety - the ""greatest hits"" by the same artists, on the same label, are a much better deal."
5,Excellent resouce - beautiful,"This is a beautiful book that include photographs of ballet performances from around the world, with pencil drawings that show, in detail, the positions in basic leotard. What I love about this book is that it covers a wide range of movements... from warming up and stretching, the basic positions, steps and movements, to pas de deux. Every line and stance is drawn perfectly - from finger tip to toe. My daughter's dance instructor borrowed the book to illustrate some of the pas de deux movements in her partnering class, and I wanted to buy a copy for her. It's a shame this book is out of print, I would highly recommend it - it's worth the search to acquire a copy!"
1,Disappointing,"It sticks to my dashboard, but nothing else will stick to it. My iPod, sunglasses, cell phone, etc fall off. I've tried washing it off in the hopes that it would get stickier, but it didn't help. I think if my dashboard were perfectly flat it would work quite well, but if your car's dash is even slightly angled, forget about the iGrip working."
4,Ok GPS holder,"I bought three at the price of $3.45(about $6 each with shipping and handling. I bought it to hold my Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS and works pretty well except that the GPS monitor, when on the pad, is tilted upwards so it's a little difficult to see the screen (you can pull the pad closer to solve that). Also, based on previous reviews, I'm a little paranoid that the sticky pad will leave residue on my dashboard, especially as the weather gets hotter. I check the surface quite often and last week, I found a kind of glossy surface under the pad, which I rubbed off using a cloth. I will continue to check my dashboard, but overall, it's better than driving with one hand on the wheel and one hand holding the GPS. My GPS stays put on the pad."
1,Best wishes getting a copy that is clear,"I ordered this book and when I received it I could NOT understand it. I have no problem that it is printed using some type of special printer for old books, but almost all of the ""s""s were printed as ""f""s.I really wanted this book so I requested a replacement copy. I asked Amazon to check the book before they sent the replacement and did they? Nope! I received the same distored copy as I did the first time. I don't know how the other people who reviewed this book were able to do so. Apparently they received a copy that was worth keeping. Twenty bucks for about 70 pages is outrageous, but I was willing to pay that price for a book that could be read.Be careful if you order this book!! I am sure it is a good book if you can read it."
2,Mediocre,"Despite the ""hot"" cover and interesting historical period involved, this book is actually quite dull and poorly written. Spender is known as a poet and memoirist, not a novelist. There is no narrative pace, the characters are thinly drawn, and the plot is meandering. It is interesting as an artifact in the Auden-Isherwood-Spender literary history, for those who care, not as a novel in itself. Let the reader be warned."
3,Tattooed Tears(1979),"Just saw it on hulu, It's about the California Youth Authority and looks at the kids behind bars. California still has such a problem,but it should start with the parents in the home,there is nothing wrong with punishment it's when you let criminals out early that's the problem."
2,Same as King Buscuit CD...Save Your Money,"This cd is the same as the Greg Kihn live on the King Buscuit show except that the songs are in different order. Like the Head East cd, this cd starts with the show-stopping favorite tune first. ""Another Time, Another Place"" is the fifth song here, where it was first on the King Buscuit cd. I would like have burned ""Another Time, Another Place"" from the King Buscuit cd except Kihn has this long dialogue after the song introducing the next song written by Bruce Springsteen in the same space. It's still there.Buying this cd is like buying the King Buscuit cd except you have fewer songs and you have them in the wrong order."
2,"10 More Actua, Official LSAT PrepTests",I was disappointed with this book. I thought the book would include more recent LSATs. I was especially hoping to get practice with the new comparative reading; this was not in any of the tests which were included in the book. However there was a section in the introduction that discussed the new comparative reading.
3,get the latest version,"I didn't think it mattered which practice tests I got. As it turns out, many of the practice lessons in the other books were duplicated from earlier tests. So... the more recent the better, I'd say."
5,good bargain,"If you are doing self-prep this is a must! you need this amount of material to work through to ace the test! I purchased this book along with next 10 and super prep. I did not buy the green cover (the older tests) and put my money toward the newer individual test which worked well for my study plan. If you have the time and the money I say buy as many lsac tests as possible, it helps you get familiar with the wording and subject matters the lsac loves to test on!"
4,Very good preparation for taking the exam,"The reading comprehension sections in this book were easier than those of the Oct. & Dec. 2002 exams, but the other sections were comparable. I personally feel there's nothing like being exposed to actual test questions to help one feel confident going into the test. By utilizing this book alone, I was able to score in the upper 160's. I would definitely recommend it."
3,good practice,"if you are going to take the lsat, you need lots of practice and that is just what this book will give you. the answer sheet is identical to the real thing, and all of the answers and scoring are included so you will know just how you did on any test."
3,LSAT PrepTests could use explanations,"While it's beneficial to have the answers to the practice tests, they mean little if there's no explanation as to why A is better than B or C is the right answer as opposed to D. Explanations would make this workbook perfect."
2,Misrepresentation of the term 10 MORE...,"This book makes it seem as though we will be getting 10 RECENT LSAT preptests, including the NEW Lsat preptests. Instead, I received this book, published in August 2007, mind you, that has preptests from June 1996- June 1999!So, can someone explain to me why exactly this is titled 10 MORE, when I've just received 10 Previous!?"
4,Good Standard Prep,No hype or pizzazz. Just actual tests that can be used for practice. You supply the stopwatch.
4,Great study material but book falls apart too easily,"If this bood did not fall apart at the binder so easily, I would have rated it with 5 stars. The publisher needs to put more glue in the binding or something to keep the pages from falling apart. Other than that, it is a must for studying for the LSAT."
4,My copy fell apart,"I won't write anything about how I studied or otherwise prepared for the LSAT. I will say this, because no other reviews have mentioned it: The binding is not the best quality. My book fell apart after taking the first test. Still, it is a good selection of real LSAT exams, and provides ample opportunity to practice."
2,A poor book--poorly written and edited. Good exercises.,"I've seen worse. And I'm actually reading it instead of simply tossing it in the trash. But that's the best I can say. The book is rife with typos, never a good sign in a computer book. There are factual mistakes as well, though usually these are obvious. It's actually two separate books by two different authors: one on Java and the other on the Visual J++ environment. The latter, irritatingly, is really about VJ++ 1.0, not the environment specified in the book's title. I found the exercises useful in learning Java. Answers are provided--just not always to the exercises as stated! In particular, I spent a lot of time trying to get a wait()/notify() exercise to work, only to find that the author apparently couldn't either. In that same exercise, the author candidly admits that he ""dunno"" why one part of his code is necessary. Bottom line: Don't buy this book. There must be better ones out there."
5,Wonderful baritone,"A very special singer. I second the other reviewers' comments, and add that I have been singing along, as best I can, all morning, to this wonderful CD. An exceptional Largo, by the way, even given the aria's warhorse status."
5,I'll Take a Mass of Snot with a Warm Heart...,"I regret not discovering this gem earlier...A thoroughly entertaining compendium of intergalactic lifeforms as household sidekicks...""Bongoid"" was too frenetic for my taste...Very much like scrambled eggs served with hot sauce--glorious to behold but the tongue will strangle you if you fancy the notion of a forkful!!"
2,Cute but slight,"A fine book if you're looking for cute, rather mindless entertainment, but nothing particularly noteworthy."
2,Not wat I expeted,The songs are adited as they say but I think they are way too short. I would recommend to get the full version of the songs.
4,Really funny and cute,"Preston is out doing his daily stuff, when SUDDENLY! he changes his mind and doesn't get harmed by the wolf stalking him.This book is full of cartoon violence, as the poor wolf (yeah, right) gets more and more injured while trying to harm the lucky Preston.The timing in this book is perfect, and it's great for those more interactive storytimes."
3,Limited,"I was hoping for Kingslake to dump his great Kodak design knowledge in this book. He did not. Book opens saying that Double Gauss is not discussed! I sold the book to a local 2nd hand book store for 50 cents. Book has some basics of optical design and might be of interest to those wanting to have all the writings of this great designer.As I reread my review and see only 2 of 8 liking it I must remark that this Sacred Cow of optics books, to get a good review, should have had a full description of the double Gauss lens design, the most important lens design in the history of photographic lenses and no doubt fully understood by Kingslake. The book has historical value for those loving lens design and its history but is a great disappointment for its missing information from this great designer."
1,not worth the money,"This book is so general and basic, if you have the slightest awareness of phsychology and childhood then you could have written this book. Sections are short and light in value. Summary: daughters look to their mothers as a role model and fathers influence a daughter's future relationships."
2,Ectaco TL-2S,"I purchased this item for as trip to Mexico, last year. It came in handy although it is a bit large and cumbersome. The touch wand appears to be very fragile and broke from limited use. The device has been stored for a year, when I removed it to take on another trip I found the touch screen would not calibrate.I do not recommend you waste your money on this one!"
2,works great for a month,We use these for karaoke monitors. Have purchased three of them now and returned one so far and now two more have to go back. After approximately a month of use this unit develops and unknown distortion from somewhere internally. Not from being dropped or anything. get something more reliable
3,Over my head...,"I should have looked at this before I bought it. It's great but I was blown away, it shouldn't have been my first astrology book. I was looking to add astrloogy to my practice and I will slowly. I will come back and review this book again, when I can read it. A warning to beginers, I would choose a simpler starting book."
5,THE BEST,this series was one of the best series we ever read. we are twins and are horse crazy. we have a horse crazy best friend also. we love this series so much!!!!!!! we wish we had all the books. we have read all of them but we wish there were more!!!!!!!!!
3,Disappointing,"After reading raves about Michelle K shoes elsewhere, I expected them to fit like a glove and be extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, the first day out I ended up with blisters on my heel from the high, curved-in heel, and raw skin elsewhere from the rough, tweed-like lining (I will be sure to wear them with socks next time). Knowing they ran both narrow and short, I ordered a half-size bigger than normal, which seems about right. I also thought the construction was a bit cheap for a high-priced shoe; the rubber accents are rather sloppily applied, and the strap holders are plastic. Live and learn--next time I will try Merrell or one of the other walking shoe manufacturers."
5,Lost Boys Poster,The poster arrived quickly. I love it. It is very big and it is a good print- the colors and picture is very good. I'm very excited to hang it in my new room :]Just make sure you have space on your wall for such a big print!
4,Good Replacement Option,"I've purchased both this and the Nite Ize LRB-07-PR1W Replacement Bulb. I think that the beam from the Nite Ize bulb is a tad better but minimally so. Other reviewers have commented about wires not being totally covered, when installed in a light, I think it is a non-issue. Overall, between the two bulbs, I'll let price be my primary factor."
4,Great practice if you know what you're doing,"I use the Regents English Workbook to help students who can't grasp basic grammar. I teach 9th graders to college Sophmores. Workbook 1 is good for 9-10 graders, 2 for upperclassmen, and I use 3 for my college students. The exercises are clear and give some introduction to the material. The answer key at the back lets students check their progress, and the exercises are fairly comprehensive.The only problem I really have with the books is how they jump around. I think author was trying to hit problems in order of most to least common. This lack of structure can be confusing however, if you want to work on a specific area you know you have trouble in."
4,Wonderful start to a new series!,This book was a wonderful story. I never write reviews but this one inspired me to. I loved the Maclean and Bella! They were so great together. I liked what he had to do to become solid and real again also. Of course being a true Highlander it took him awhile to give in and do it. The antogonists were great and I loved the use of myths in the story. If you like Karen Marie Monings work then you will love this story.
4,Happy reading.,I enjoyed the story very much. The writing was good and the charachters were fun to following during their adventure. I would definitely read other books by this author. Happy reading to you all!
3,"Average Scottish ""time travel"" romance","This was ok, but spent alot of time concentrating on sex like some of the ""time travel"" romance authors do. Relies on the steamy sex scenes to carry the plot, but I skip those, so this didn't make the plot too interesting for me."
1,trash,"do not buy...says it fits car but does not.. do not buy!!!!!!Go to a real parts store, where you can get the right part the 1st time!!!I cant even return this usless part."
1,highly do not recommend,this product is a joke and must have not been tested on the cars its supposed to fit properly...bought it for a 94 integra gsr and the screw in adapter is at least a 2mm to long thus not allowing the plate to get tight and seal....had a spare block so even tested it out on it with the same result...no seal means bad oil leak...hope this helps some other ppl out
5,One of the greatest samba singers of the 1930s,"EMI's ""Cantores Do Radio"" series is a great look at the popular singers who came before the bossa nova era... plus, with two CDs at a single CD price, these are a pretty sweet deal. Next to Carmen Miranda, Francisco Alves was probably the best-known and most beloved singer of Brazil's golden era of samba cancao. He hosted his own radio program, and popularized songs by writers such as Cartola and Ismael Silva. This is an excellent collection covering a wide variety of styles, from clattering, bouncy Carnaval sambas to classy, Hollywood-tinged ""sweet"" big band and pop vocals material, including many songs that have become MPB standards. The musicianship is top-flight throughout, as are Alves' sweet, pleasantly corny vocals. An excellent collection -- highly recommended!"
4,pleased!,Happy about my order...came quick but not in 3 days it actually came in 4 days but im not complaining because i dont take my exam until saturday so thanks!
4,Surprisingly good!,"When I purchased this CD I expected an album of average performances and OK sound. What I got though was 25 superbly clear stereo tracks rendered by quite competent orchestras.Points of criticism here are minor ones.Six Beethoven excerpts and only one of Brahms; an example of his magnificent 4th Symphony being conspicuously absent.No actual liner notes, and the two pages of contents are printed in an exceedingly small font.Hearing these favorite strains whets the appetite for the complete works, so the job of a ""sampler"" is well-fulfilled here (not a criticism!).In summary, you will find this melange of edits from the VOX catalog most satisfying indeed!TOTAL RUNNING TIME: 79:02Also recommended:25 CLASSICAL DANCE FAVORITESis a lively collection of familiar music."
2,Mediocre sound quality,"The sound quality was not crisp, and it sounded like a poor transfer of music. It sounds okay on my computer sound system, but on my high quality audio system the sound lacks clarity."
5,Major release of the year: you just feel it,"Damon Gough has put out three or four records now. They are all good. Some of them are maybe not as earth shattering as Bewilderbeast. His live show is a different story altogether. Gough plays long three-hour shows and plays songs from all his records. When you hear these songs live, you appreciate the albums more. He switches between guitar and piano, and Gough plays alone and with a group. Before I saw him in November 2003, I thought, like most, that Have You Fed The Fish was a misfire. It sounds a lot better now. I heard some of the songs on this new album then. This third proper album may be a return to the days of Bewilderbeast. Songs like ""Easy Love"" and ""Summertime In Wintertime"" are as good as it gets. As you get further into this album, it does seem wonderful. Most of the songs are efforts of mysterious beauty. It is trendy to dispose of heroes who were so dear to us a few years ago. Badly Drawn Boy is something that deserves our attention."
4,review for review's sake,"I agree One Plus One is not the same as Hour of the Bewilderbeast (or Have You Fed the Fish or the About A Boy soundtrack for that matter) - but how boring would that be people?? On first listen I was hardly blown away, but after repeated listens the album has really grown on me. It's definitely one of my favorites at the moment. I love ""Logic of a Friend.""As for writing reviews without listening (not that I agree with it), MC perhaps you misunderstood C.Hedge's intention (by not reading thoroughly)? Had I found the first and only review to be that 1-star ""open letter,"" I may have done something similar yet not as drastic."
3,Solidly descending,"Never one to disappoint fans of the acoustic-based singer/songwriter tradition, Gough has expanded his horizons and produces his ambitious folk pop now with wider instrumentation. The result is still a solid disc, containing at least a few exemplary tracks, but the urgency feels less potent then it did- a rather subtle apathy seems to have pervaded the songwriting, sometimes compensating with over-production and heavy arrangements."
3,BDB keeps going downhill,"I've been a fan of this fine songwriter since Hour of Bewilderbeast first appeared. I was amazed by that album, and still rank it in my top 20 albums of all time.The ""About a Boy"" soundtrack was a bit of a step down, but still executed with that BDB *sound* I adored so much.But Have you Fed the Fish was a true let down. The production was overdone, the songs didn't make sense (in a bad way), and the *sound* just wasn't there any more. And these weren't changes from a growning artist. These were changes of an artist who did one great album, and we'll never hear it again.One Plus One Is One is no different. BDB should go back to the basics of Bewilderbeast. I know he *tries* to in this album, but the subject matter of his lyrics are not as heartfelt. The stories just aren't there. How sad that such a talent could be so short-lived."
3,Badly Done CD?,"I'm a big fan...but. If you listen to this CD as a whole body of work, it has its moments, but if you try to pick out individual highlights you come up short. Overall, a disappoinment. ""This is that new song"" is a good Nick Drake rip-off."
2,Commercially acceptable stale outing,"If Damon Gough's success is predicated on commercial appeal, then I do believe he has hit it big with ""One Plus One Is One."" The musical explorations on this album do nothing to expand upon, or even imitate, the sheer sonic beauty he showed us he was capable of on ""...Bewilderbeast."" Compared to the rest of what's out there, ""One Plus One..."" is a decent album, but it fails to distinguish itself with any standout tracks; there is nothing close to an ""Everybody's Stalking"" or ""Once Around the Block."" Much of the album blends together and borders on the mundane. It's a shame because I never thought I'd be bored listening to a Badly Drawn Boy cd before.And the previous reviewer should take their own advice and wait till they receive the cd before giving it 5 stars and bashing other reviewers for supposedly criticizing without listening."
4,It's true; he's back,"I just Loved the hour of bewilderbeast after listening to itwhile driving from S.F. to Monterrey - a wonderful experience. Then Damon seemed to let me down. No. He's back - this really does bring it all back - mostlybeautiful stuff - especially Four Leaf Clover, The Blossoms,This is That New Song, Stockport, and Holy Grail. But it'sall good and new and different, unlike anything else.Positive. I think he could become, sometime, our nextLennon"
2,One plus one doesn't equal one,"Very disappointed in this release after Mr. Gough's other work. Rarely do I buy an album before I've heard some of the tracks, but due to liking his earlier work so much I took the plunge and bought it. More foo me... I'll be listening to the tracks on his next album before I buy it... A couple of tracks on this album are decent, but certainly not the quality of his other work. In fact if you told me this was a collection of B-sides I'd believe it...And to rub salt in the wounds, I bought this pre-release from Amazon and then they dropped its price by 22% the day it was released... Thanks!"
4,Hear Me Out,"BDB comes across as a more bucolic Style Council, with less political and more goofy, heart-on-the-sleevy type lyrics. As someone who has been in the market for a more bucolic Style Council, with less political and more goofy, heart-on-the-sleevy-type lyrics- I'm thrilled with it, but I would look elsewhere if you are looking for something else."
3,Bunch of TWITS,"I haven't reviewed any cds yet, but these reviews just made me mad. Badly Drawn Boy doesn't live up to Damon's debut, but that's some expectation being placed on him. But it is a step above Have You Fed the Fish in my opinion. He takes the almost over the top integral arrangements from that album, dumbs them down enough to weave a rich tapestry of organic and orchestrated sounds. The album could use a little more pace perhaps, but really is a beautiful sound for a raining day in London. If you like Brit-pop you should enjoy this album.As for Heidi one thing you can't say is this guy doesn't know how to play. He's a gifted musician with a great ear for composition. As for the counting comment you twit the album title obviously implies that something isn't adding up for the disenfranchised Damon who headed off to the bright lights of London a little too fast."
2,haven't heard it,"all i know about this band is that the title of their cd (1+1=1) and their video are WAAAAY to similar to a cheap radiohead ripoff (paranoid android). i've heard of this group and everyone says i should really listen, but i'm already turned off by their lack of originality. good luck, maybe i'm the one missing the point....not likely.g"
4,Nice and Big,"This caxixi was bigger than I expected. Almost too big for a berimbau! It is good quality however, and sound great!"
2,Broke already,"Item was received asan Xmas gift. It broke within the first two weeks, I also almost lost my keys several times during the two weeks I used it."
1,Overall terrible design,"I really needed something to organize all my keys and found this at a local retailer. Terrible mistake.1) The LED button pops off constantly and I lost the battery within 2 days. No more light for me.2) The build quality is very poor and the latch would often lock so that I could not detach the keys.3) After a few months it broke in half and now all my keys are separateIf you want to lose your keys and be frustrated, this is perfect."
1,Unreliable,I only used 2 of the rings for my car and work keys. They kept coming out of the base part-luckily I didn't lose them. Finally gave up on it and bought a different one.
2,Acceptable...barely,"The build quality, fit and finish of this keychain is below par. The key rings don't slide very smoothly, but it does get the job done in terms of being able to quickly attach and remove the various keyrings. One major gripe I have is that after using the keychain for a couple of days the battery cover for the light came off...I don't know how because the keychain simply went in and out of my pocket several times a day (this is what I call 'normal use'). The battery cover connects the 2 batteries for the light to function, so now that there is no battery cover, the light is inoperable. So at the end of the day, this thing does hold my keys, but I wouldn't buy another one."
5,Dreaming wide awake ...,"Loreena McKennitt's music -- and her otherworldly voice -- are a rare gift. Surely her music is ""Celtic"", but so many other influences are incorporated here -- and the amazing thing is how well they mesh. I've never been lucky enough to catch any of her live performances, but this 2-CD set captures what the atmosphere must be like at one of her concerts: a dreaming, oceanic, passionate, and haunting (yes, I have to use that word!) few hours spent in the company of a phenomenally talented artist and her traveling band, completely simpatico with her musical sensibilities. Highly recommended. If the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood had a soundtrack, Loreena McKenitt's music would surely be on it."
5,Glad to see her get the credit due,"Excellent voice, phrasing and music that is original in an otherwise sea of Pop/Rock from other artists."
3,"It's a live album, okay we get it","Musically, the recording is beautiful in every way except the long audience applause before and after every selection breaks the spell. Why did the producer feel that he had to put the audience applause on the recording? Is this somehow proof that it is indeed a live recording?"
5,"Music so passionate and beautiful, it can take you anywhere!","Thank you, thank you, thank you for this marvelous work. No new songs, but every song is still fresh and demonstrates the unequaled voice this woman possesses -- not to mention her multi-faceted instrumental ability. And the backing musicians. All of them are outstanding talents that enhance Loreena's music. With over two hundred CDs in my collection, I still play Loreena's music most often. You can't go wrong here."
3,"Good, but only if you don't have her studio CDs","This is a beautiful album--there's no doubt about it. Loreena McKennitt is a wonderful gift to the Celtic music fans of the world. I especially love that she is mindful of the fact that the Celts *were not* strictly in Ireland and the British Isles, but all over continental Europe as well. Her dabbles in Middle Eastern sounds were a nice treat, too.However, I purchased this CD because I loved all the other so very much and I was hoping for fresher, new variations of her wonderful songs. I was disappointed. The songs sound very similar to the studio versions; she didn't remix much at all. While I remain a true fan of Loreena's, I don't recommend this album to those of you who already own the studio releases. It just isn't worth it."
5,Y'all souls' night,"Loreena's always great, but I miss the ""Knight and Burgher, Lord and Dame"" stanza on The Lady Of Shalott for its visuals for the final scene. The big surprise is in All Souls' Night. After 5 seconds, the piano decides ""We are going to play this song with an easy going country-rock rhythm; less in common with Enya, but more like Emmylou Harris."" The fiddle agrees. The ""rolling hillsides"" and ""cornstalks"" fade from Medieval to Americana. As you drive to the square-dance, where figures dance around and around, you see headlights in the distance. A green-eyed host greets you to this truck-stop....The strange thing is, is that it's not that strange."
4,Nice live album,"I am not a huge fan of Loreena McKennitt's, but after hearing some of her songs, I had to purchase this album. Her voice is beautiful and almost flawless, though I find her music doesn't have a lot of range. Still, if you enjoy this kind of music, get this album!"
5,Endless Combinations of Fun and Learning,I purchased these weighted numbers for my grandchildren in conjunction with the pan balance. It is a perfect learning toy for a toddler that grows w him/her. There are multiple uses for the weighted numbers... if you purchase a second set the child can be introduced to number recognition by tangibly finding the matching number or placing like numbers on opposite sides of the balance scale to see if they are even and match! As their skills grow the child can do number combinations i.e. 4 and 3 for 7. An art project can also be incorporated by tracing the numbers with a pencil. The uses are limited only by your imagination.
3,Ho hum,"Easily the best of this series, but not so good nonetheless. I am a big 'Ella Enchanted' fan, and as such expect more of Levine. The characters in this retelling of Cinderella are more likeable and the plot follows better. But nonethless, the book comes across as very frivolous, even for its target audience. I applaud Levine for giving readers a more active heroine (and hero). This is a good one to read once, or to read to children."
4,"Shot, but funny it's Cinerella with a twist","I really liked the twist in this book because, I think, there are too many Cinderella stories now days. To give the book a twist made it more interesting, not to mention more fun, to read. You couldn't predict as much. Even more than the twist was the humor. When Cinderellis couldn't take his helmet off to know what the princess was saying I laughed really hard. The only thing I didn't like about this book was how short it was. Levine could have gone on another ten chapters, yet she didn't."
5,Ciderella with a twist by leah grier,Cinderellis is always underestimated by his two brothers and his father. But when a chance to prove his bravery comes of course he accepts. Its Cinderella with a delightful twist and I recomend that you go buy thiscomedic fractured fairytale.
1,Cinderellis: It Doesn't Deserve To Be Published!!!!!!,"Frankly, Cinderellis isn't NEARLY as good as Ella Enchanted,and Ella Enchanted is rather good. The plot and characters are dumb, and yes, even stupid at times, and altogether, extremely dull. As I look back now, it's a wonder I decided to finish the book. The characters are more or less believable, most of the time, anyway. The parts about the potions are so impossibly impossible, I can barely describe it. I have read others in this series, and they, too, have been very disappointing!"
1,The first honest review,"Well,there is humor in it,overall. Gail Carson Levine does put wit into her stories, but something fell apart in this book. Chapter eight is a perfect example of where an entertaining story went bad. At first, we look through Marigold's point of view, then we look through Cinderellis's. After that, the chapter is just confusing. It goes back and forth between both of their minds that I don't know whose I am in. I think Miss Levine could have done a better job in writing this story. I think the humor was the only thing good about it."
3,Lab book,"Took FOREVER to get here, was filthy, dirty, sticky (yuck). After cleaning the cover with ""409"", I was able to touch it. Will be a handy reference during my work as a nurse. Won't buy a used book from this person again...."
3,"Pretty Good, Can't Complain","This book was bigger than I thought. It holds alot of information, and is very detailed. This was a used book, it didn't have any marking and it wasn't missing any pages. I must admit, it was pretty good so I can't complain."
2,Ughhhhhh!,This book is useless. I only bought it for school and once I was able to sell I back I ran this thing back to the book store to get rid of it.
1,Mosby's Manual of Diagnostic and Laboratory Tests,"Packaging from this vendor was very poor. Book was purhcased for Christmas give, was shipped in a plain manila envelope with no added protection and looked like it had been around the world on a mule train. Covers and pages were torn and tattered."
5,Mosby's manual of Diagnostic and Labratory Tests,"Very fast shipping, and book is in pristine shape. I would buy from seller again."
5,Mosby's Manual of Diagnostic and Laboratory Tests,The best of its kind. Get it. It will help you understand and explain to the patient.
4,Mosby's,"The book came quickly and as-advertised. Not in great shape, but it was only listed as ""fair."" Overall, a good transaction."
2,"Very incomplete, a lot of useless information","I bought this book because I thought it had information about esotheric tests that other manuals don't have. This is pretty much the same. I may be useful for RNs and other health care professionals, but for MDs."
3,DS game,I didn't like the game play of this flyer type of game on the DS platform. This would be better played on a PC with a flight stick.
1,Disappointed in Rating,"I just received this in hopes of giving it to my son for Christmas. I should have known not to buy a gaming product with ""Rate Pending"". Upon receipt of this game, I find that it is rated ""Teen"" and has warnings of Mild Violence, Mild Language and of all things ""Use of Alcohol"". Why is this necessary in gaming??? It is illegal for teens to use alcohol, so why should the games that they play promote it??? This product is being sent back for refund."
5,A great way to understand German.,"Carol Fehringer's German Grammar in Context provides a great way to learn the german language. The book is very well organized and has excellent lessons on German grammar. It covers the essential subjects dealing with grammar, from present tense and articles all the way to the conditional and syntax. The excerpts from various german media make for great reading and helps open up your knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary. This book focuses solely on Grammar and it would probably help to have a dictionary around as a reference. The lessons get right to the point and the exercises provide a great way to learn and memorize the concepts from the lesson.Overall, this book is perfect for someone with a little background in the language and wants to have a reference or for a beginner who would like a great study of the grammar handy. It's well worth the money."
2,Vocabulary!,"This book has a number of problems. The main one is that it uses a lot of very rare vocabulary and has no glossary. I found dozens of words not in my Langenscheidt dictionary. So you have to know a LOT of German to use this book.Some of the readings seem inappropriate for the topic of the chapter, with only one or two examples of the grammar point at issue illustrated.Lastly, where is the help from typograhy? It would be more useful to use color or font to highlight the grammatical structures, either in the reading itself of in the discussion."
4,good,very handy cant beat the price wish there were more music production terms but overall a good handy thing to have
5,Handy pocket-sized reference,"This book has been a handy reference for me on many occasions. Concise, well written and comprehensive musical definitoins in a pocket size book that you can take anywhere!"
3,"Worth it, for a while","Racket eventually broke after a couple months of playing. Strings loosened a bit, but worked well for the couple months prior. worth [...] bucks"
5,So fun! Tons of ideas.,"A lot of great ideas for gifts that I would never have thought of on my own. Perfect for Christmas, Birthdays for friends, and even special hostess gifts. Nothing is more appreciated than a gift you made yourself."
5,A Spanish Depeche Mode.,"This has got to be one of the best albums I have ever heard! It is SUPERB. Every single track on here is magnificent. Mnia is like a Spanish Depeche Mode, and that is great. Depeche Mode is, by far, one of the greatest groups of all time, and Mnia is just like them, but for the next millennium. There is so much emotion and energy packed into each track that you are in heaven while you listen. It is even more enjoyable to get a pair of headphones and turn it up loud to hear all of the little things embedded into each track. Tracks #1, #6, and #9 are some of the best songs I have heard in my life. Please listen to me and buy this album; you don't have to speak Spanish to understand these songs. Adición is sure to be a classic."
5,awesome,"I was a witness of moenia's humble beginings,when nobody gavea penny for their music.Now we have to pay to see them and to listen to their music,which is somehow relaxing(especially their acoustic versions of no importa que el sol se muera and estabas ahi.Like I mentioned before I witness the begining and evoluction of this group ,which has become one of my favorites.so,if you liked this album,I suggest you listen moenia mixes and televisor,both exelent albums and a must have for meoenia's fans"
3,Not a good beach mystery,"After reading Closet and Tribe I was excited to see a new book by Mr. Zimmerman featuring gay newscaster Todd Mills. Although, this mystery follows the earlier high standards of the earlier works it is much darker. My disappointment could have been due to the fact that I purchased this as one of my ""read at the beach"" books and it was more emotionally based than I expected. Even though I was disappointed I would still recommend it to friends."
3,IT HAS ITS MOMENTS,Fast-paced mystery story. Interesting premise but disappointing end. Plot is a bit muddled and confusing. Okay for a fast read.
4,heavy metal,"The Modey Lemon are one of the heaviest bands now playing. This is their second record. Pittsburgh steel and Black Sabbath influence them. They are more hard rock than garage rock. The band is Phil Boyd on guitar and vocals and Paul Quattrone on drums. The first few songs really hit you hard. It's much like vicious attacks on small animals. They are very direct. Live they are one of the best bands. Three songs on this record along could kill communism, or any philosophical system. Now they have a third member on guitar so that could be more interesting. ""Enemy"" is one of the strongest songs on this album. It sounds like big trucks driving our your parent's house. They have intensity in their music. They keep it dirty and evil. Jesus Christ is already a fan. They supposedly recorded this album in the same room where Jimi Hendrix died. 3/5th of New Mexico will have already bought this record. I can't wait for the next one."
3,It's okay,Triple Witch is okay for a cozy mystery. It has the elements of a cozy mystery but I was bored at times. This is the first Sarah Graves mystery I have read so regular followers might attribute my not catching her writing style. I may try another to see if being bored was just the state of my mind (at the time) or if the story (having read so many mysteries over time) was really that predictable.
2,NOT a Maine accent,"Having lived in Maine 40 years, I find it literally painful to listen to this audiobook. The reader's supposed Maine accent is tone-deaf. And she didn't even bother to find out how to pronounce the word ""Bangor."" It is NOT ""Bang-er."" It's ""Bang-or."" Unfortunately, Bangor is mentioned often in the book!"
5,LOVE THIS AUTHOR,GREAT WIT & ABILITY TO KEEP THE READER ENTERTAINED! RECEIVED QUICKLY AND IN GOOD CONSITION.
5,Fascinating.,"First things first, the book is an excellent overview of ID. However, if you are familiar with ID, the book doesn't go into research level depth. The final essay by Bruce Gordon was the highlight for me. It discussed whether teleological (directed toward a goal) explanations could be incorporated into science.Second, if you will notice, the negative reviews of this book are filled with over-used cliches and really are simply uninformed. They are written by people who simply mouth the words of the people they follow and seemingly can't think for themselves. A well-thought out critique would be appreciated, but ad hominems are unacceptable to the discerning individual."
3,What Intelligent Design is Not...,"""Signs of Intelligence"" is a collection of scholarly essays on various aspects of this recent approach to scientific discovery. Though in its infancy, the authors present ID (Intelligent Design) as a potentially viable option to the scientific methods which dominate the halls of academia. Great care is taken to help us understand ID is not religion-based nor is it ""creation science"". Rather it is shown to be an alternative based upon existing scientific criteria used in such areas as forensics, information sciences (i.e. code-breaking) and even the S.E.T.I search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. Worth a read."
1,It's a GREAT BOOK,"I think this is exactly the kind of textbook that should be distributed in abundance throughout all states wanting ID as part of their science curriculum. This will not only guarantee my two daughters a great deal less competition in medical school, it will also help fill the need for astute, critical thinkers in the food service industry.An EXCELLENT BOOK!David/San Francisco"
1,Entertaining but no meat.,"Despite the assertion of other reviewers, the text does not resolve the conundrum leading to need for a infinity of creators. To merely state that ""An eternal, uncreated designer does not have a beginning or a creator"" does not provide resolution but at best merely conjectures the existence of at least one eternal, uncreated designer. One could as well conjecture that there are innumerable such uncreated designers that simultaneously compete for design space in a finite domain of design space. Neither conjecture is testable hence neither is preferable."
1,pseudo science,"Evolutionary selection effects on populations have been observed countless times under laboratory conditions. ""Intelligent design"" theory is pseudo-science concocted by persons either unwilling or afraid to confront reality."
1,The bad side of humanity,"It's sad and sickening that people buy such a book. It claims it's ""science"" only because the author realizes that cracked ideas like this serve no purpose in reality.The author uses linguistics and fallacies to trick their audience (most likely a group of bible thumpers with no interest in truth) to believe what they say. However, this book lies about evidence, and twists evidence to fit this scheme.The world is a big place with many deceptive egomaniacs. If you seek the truth for truths sake, stay away from religious mythology and be a commander of science..."
4,Lip Stain!,"I really like this procuct the only thing I have a complaint against is that it doesnt stay on long enough and you have to spread it evenly with your finger tip after application with the roller ball. To make it work the best, is to put it on even it out with finger and than put on a light clear gloss on top!, that makes it stay on much longer!"
1,Reminds me of Halloween makeup!,"This reminds me of the fake blood my son used for his Halloween costume! Takes too much fooling around to get it right. Not worth it, and tastes like cough medicine."
3,Just Bitten,"I bought the ""blood orange"" color to go along with the Pinch Me line of sheer gel cheek color in ""peach afterglow"" ... The colors look nice together. The lip stain could taste better. It is a roller tip, which I am not crazy about, but I like the stain because it isn't goopy like gloss and can look natural or applied in excess for a really robust color. I sometimes use it with Sally Hansen lip inflation for a pouty look. This review sounds like an ad, haha, I'll stop now."
2,Very difficult to precisely apply,"This product is a runny liquid, the consistency of water, which comes in a tube with a large rollerball applicator. Because the rollerball is so large, it is very difficult to get a precise application of color. Also, once you start applying it, the liquid remains wet (not moist, but really WET) for about 10 seconds and if you go over the wet spots, the rollerball just wants to slide over them. What I ended up doing was applying big stripes of color and then using my finger to smooth the wet color into the corners of my mouth and the peaks of my upper lip. Then I pressed my lips together to make sure there were no ""blotches."" This is too labor-intensive for me so I won't be buying it again.The Plum Wicked color is very nice, more of a berry shade than a true plum."
2,Didn't work for me,Maybe because I am olive coloring that this did not work for me. It felt cheap and did not work at all. Would not buy again. This is not the sellers fault but the product.
2,Dissappointing,The recordings are fair at best. The performances poor to better.I will dispose of this one.
2,Book Review,"Moves a bit slow for me, but an interesting book to read. Makes you wonder how often in real life the situations are repeated."
5,GK Chesterton is great!,Man needs spiritual growth and Chesterton is the best to do this in a great style.
5,Great character studies.,The man who knew too much has an excellent plot with colorful characters that are indelibly etched in my memory. This entrancing mystery with its many casual forays into the lives of high level power brokers will pique your suspicious nature and confound you with a powerful and unexpected conclusion.
4,Entertaining short stories.,"This was pretty entertaining. There was a bit of a Sherlock Holmes feel to many of these stories.They were very well written and quite witty and inventive. Many of the stories had quite unexpected elements to them. They were certainly quirky and different.There was a slightly strange and melancholic feel to some of them, especially the last one. There was a certain amount of xenophobia as well.Horne Fisher is a great and unusual character and there were also quite a few other interesting characters.There were some fantastic lines and even the odd bit of philosophy in this collection of stories."
2,So So,"As an engineer, I like to read scientific items. I found this book to be difficult to ""get into"". It seemed to wander about. Not a clear objective to the writing."
3,Odd but interesting,"If you believe this is the movie root for Hitchcock presentations, this will surprise you. It is most unusual and the stories evolve into plots and twists that reveal an author who is also a theologian, hymn writer and author of Father Brown detective stories."
2,short stories with a common hero,"The style of writing is dated, making it seem superficial and the characters lacking in any depth. This is one of the few books that I haven't been able to keep reading, even when I had nothing else on my kindle."
1,Vague doesn't mean artistic,"The premise for this one is halfway interesting, but the actual product is boring, blundering, confusing, loop hole-filled, and very dry--as in not much blood. Sub Rosa labels this one as ""Extreme"" as if it were actually living up to some standard when in reality it is much the opposite.I can get past bad acting and how slow most horror movies pace themseleves, but when it adds up to nothing it makes me very mad. Don't you dare buy this. Shatter Dead is one of Sub Rosa's better pics, but other than that, I haven't seen much that impresses me by this company."
3,Well worth the price,"I have been shopping for a DVD with a good selection of Bach's works. This is the best one I have seen yet, but it's still not what I've been looking for, that probably doesn't exist. This DVD cannot be faulted for its selections, that is a matter of taste; EXCEPT, I cannot understand how the St. Matthew Passion could have been left out. That omission, to me, is inexcusable. Nevertheless, the selections chosen would still make this a fine gift, particularly for those who have not yet been exposed to his works. Unfortunately, there is one more thing about this disc that makes me wonder why the DVD format was chosen when an acoustic CD or MP3 download would have been more appropriate, the visual portion. Rather than clips of the performing orchestras, choirs, and singers, you get lakes, waterfalls clouds, rivers, birds, trees, and leaves, etc. Nice in their own way, but adding nothing to the music despite what the label says."
4,25 Bach Favorites,A very nice CD for beginners who are starting to appreciate the music of Bach. A well-rounded example of his compositions.
2,not good to my taste.,"Too many pieces have been performed with stringcord instruments, and I just don't feel good about the sound of classic piano. This is just my personal taste, I guess."
5,The Other Daphnis et Chloe,"Even though there are a few minor technical glitches, a tiny tape drop out etc., I treasure this recording more than my copy of the commercial 1959 recording that Monteaux made of Daphnis with The London Symphony for Decca. The Concertgebouw has, since the days it was under the baton of Mengelberg, always been one of the greatest ensembles in the world. This 1955 live recording confirms that fact. Monteux combines a beautiful reading of Ravel's ballet masterpiece, adding the electricity only to be found in a live performance. Add the superb voicing of the Toonkunst Koor, and you have the recipe for a recording that every fan of Monteux, or for that matter Ravel, must have in their collection! Victoria De Los Angeles adds delicious readings of Ravel's Sheherazade (poems by Klingsor) recorded in 1963. The recordings are mono, but high fidelity! A few minutes into the CD you will be lost in the music and won't care anyway!"
4,Dr. Who Specials,"Great disc set. It arrived in good time. the package was slightly handled, but I'm buying this to watch, not display under plastic. I am enjoying the series, perhaps more than the the first time."
3,the end of the doctor:,"I was please overall with this dvd set..however the end of time part 1&2 were not that good..please kill off the old timelords..they realy are bad ,what save this part of the dvd is the last few mins of part two when the doctor try to set some things rights..it was a good ending to a good doctor:"
5,"the water of mars, just awesome!","WOW!!! I just watched The Water of Mars with my 7 year old daughter, what a fantastic episode, the monster budget they must have to create a T.V. episode must rival a full length Hollywood movie. From the stunning visual quality to the orchestra music. What a terrible shame that David Tennant has left the show, he is truely a great actor, one that can make the viewer feel his emotion and passion."
4,Fitting farewell,"I'd never watched Doctor Who until Matt Smith came around, and during the break in seasons decided to catch up on the pre-Smith new series. Took me awhile to get into Tennant's Doctor, but by ""Girl in the Fireplace"" I was onboard. I was watching these on BBC America, until I realized that occasionally a ""specials"" episode actually ran 50, 60 minutes or longer, and BBCA was editing them down to about 42 minutes to fit into an hour of television. Basically you're missing a third of the episode!So since all the ""specials"" ending Tennant's run were that length, I purchased the blu-ray. Picture and sound quality are excellent. As for the episodes themselves, I was surprised to end up liking ""The Waters of Mars"" best. Great episode."
2,"Great show, Great Episodes, Bad Blu Ray Product","The discs in this set will not play right on my Samsung 3D Blu Ray player. The sound cuts out constantly and you have to keep hitting pause then play to hear a few more seconds of audio before it happens again. I sent back the set and got a replacement, but the new ones did the same thing. I took my Blu Ray player back and got a different model, but the problem was even worse! I don't know if it's a problem where these won't play on just Samsung players, or if this is widespread, but I really wanted these to work. Instead I've had to send back the Blu Ray set and I guess I'll have to settle for DVDs of the Specials instead. I haven't been able to find anything on the internet about this problem happening to anyone else, but since I tried replacements of the discs and the player I seriously doubt it's just me. If you buy these, don't just let them sit on the shelf for a while; try them out first."
5,Amazing way to end a epic journey,"This was an amazing way to end the epic journey of David Tennant through his seasons as the timelord. Yes he is the best doctor so far, but this still doesn't mean that the next one wont be good, yeah he wont be a david tennant but it still will be an amazing show still. Now about the 5 episodes. I loved them all, deffinetly a good way to end David's reign as the timelord. I love the end of time part 1 and 2, (spoiler) I love how they brought the time lords back, i think they should of made it so gallifrey still came back but didn't take over the earth, so the timelords would be back for the new doctor to make up for the fact that tennant is leaving, but thats just what i think. I love these, and I have ordered them on blu ray, and i know they will be amazing quality because bbc is amazing at putting there shows onto blu ray with amazing quality."
4,FAREWELL DOCTOR,"David Tennants tenure as Doctor who was brilliant. He really got the role and was fantastic. These specials are his farewell.In ""The Next doctor"" he takes on the cybermen and someone who claims he to is the Doctor. In ""Planet of the Dead"" the Doctor is on a bus trasnported to a desert world where creatures threaten the bus and our world as well. The Doctor is also teamed up with a sexy thief. The ""He Will Knock 4 times"" Prophecy is first stated here. In ""Waters of Mars"" the Doctor must observe a tragic point in history. But his anger gets the best of him and he goes to far. Well done story that features a virus from an old enemy. In ""The end of time"" the Doctor goes face to face again with the Master. But the master isnt the big worry of the day as the Timelords are returning. Its the end but the Doctor goes out fighting and saves a friend. David Tennant was awesome. Now its Matt Smiths turn to take control of the Tardis."
5,A gift for my husband and daughter,My husband and my daughter are Who extremists. They never miss one show. Just had to get this for them so they could watch whenever they wanted. Great buy!
5,Great show,It's a must watch bbc dr who is one of the greatest shows ever. Great story great plots all round great
5,"A concise, compelling epic","One of Roger Zelazny's finest novels, this tale of a man who embodies an alien god encompasses science-fiction, mythology, psychology, and the poignancy of being human - and does so in well under 200 pages. There's no overload of unconvincing background minutiae here - with no more than a few colorful strokes, Zelazny creates a rich and meaningful universe for his flawed protagonist Francis Sandow. What begins as a confrontation between two powerful men swiftly becomes a private apocalypse between two gods ... without ever losing its human scale. Dazzling, exciting, moving, satiric, this book deserves to be reprinted soon!"
4,"Very Good, Quintessential Zelazny","This is classic Zelazny: the merging of man and mythology. In this case, the mythology is entirely alien (the Pei'an pantheon), and, as seems to be the norm for Zelazny, the man (Francis Sandow) is darn near immortal. Also, as usual for Zelazny, the magic is there. My only complaint with the book is that I wish there were more of it. There's an awful lot of stuff that Zelazny hints at that could form entire books on their own. Unfortunately, the only other book with this main character in it is ""To Die in Italbar."" It's been a while since I read that book, but I remember it as also being very good. Wishing for more, I rate this book at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."
2,Stay Away,Any image that has a lot of white will start to move up and down with a large black bar accross the middle of your screen (like older TVs acted when they weren't tuned just right)
1,Does Not Work No Reply from Seller,"We got the product for for our kids hooked it up and the product doesn't completly work only certain inputs work. Remote was sent with a dead battery. I didn't actualy expect a battery at all but if the product doesn't even work with my TV, WII,PS2, DVD Player or Surround sound all at once or individually hooked why am I going to waste more money on a battery. Would not purchase from them again! NO RESPONCE IN EMAILS"
3,Works but...,"I'll get distortion on a primarly white background, or if there's too many vertical lines on the screen. It's a minor distraction, but I'm still using it because it means I don't have to get up and use the old button box I had before. If I don't get a new TV with more inputs and outputs than I already have, I'll probably buy a better remote AV switch in the future."
1,POS,As soon as I opened this thing I realized the remote was broke. Then when I finally hooked it all up my picture was all blurry no matter what I did to it. Thank god I went HD and now I only have to worry about 2 wires. Get a HDTV !!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great Monitor,"I bought this for 270$ and for the price compared to some this was a great deal,also has a great design and the picture quality is very good,also great if you have a mac mini ..I don't but I have my DS Lite on the base so it still has something there to look just as clean and pristine as the monitor itself.I like how it keeps the cords tidy with the clip on the back.So if on a under 300$ budget and like Apples taste in design and have a mac mini it's perfect or just a PC user like me who wants the look also great."
5,son loved them,he wore this shoes to death best pair I ever bought him with out him a round to pick out
2,Not helping,"I bought this and the Up Right Pillow for our trip to Florida. The Up Right Pillow worked great to fix the problem. The kid's head flops forward in their carseat and boosters. This pillow doesn't stop that! If they are leaning back enough it I guess but most kids aren't. This one takes work to hook to the headrest and get fitted just right behind them... which arches up their body and back. The other one you just hold under your chin with hands in place. Easy to do and the kids love them. Okay, I even like the UpRight Pillow for me!!! Try that one first!"
4,no more flopping head,"The Toddler Coddler is a great product.The only problem that I found with it is that when I put my carseat in the middle of the back seat (the safest place), I don't have a headrest...so there is nowhere to attach it. However I remedied this problem by attaching it directly to the carseat. I just wrapped it through the seatbelt holder on the sides of the car seat and clipped it together in the back. It doesn't interfer with the safety of the car seat at all. It also enabled my son to reach the pillows when gets tired. Which is nice, because otherwise I would have to stop the car and get him set up. I also love the fact that it is machine washable!! It keeps his head propped up perfectly and he looks sooo much more comfortabe. I would definitly recommend this product. I love it!"
2,not sure if used it right,We really wanted to like this product but it just didn't work for us. From the picture it looked like the pillows should sit behind the toddler's shoulders but we couldn't get it to fit there properly with the straps. Maybe we weren't using it right...
4,Great buy,THis was a great purchase for my 3 year old daughter. It helped keep her head up when she napped as we traveled. This was a great purchase.
1,Lita,Head support was not that good. I had to put something else there to help support my grandson's head.
3,Too big for plane travel,"We purchased these for our 2-year-old for our trip to Europe. They are pretty large and bulky to bring in carry on luggage, considering how limited carry on space is these days. For plane flights I should have purchased something inflatable - these are better for car trips when you have more room. Our son didn't want us to set them up before he fell asleep, so we had to sneak them in after he dozed off. They definitely help with head slumping and seemed to make it more comfortable for him to sleep in his car seat. There is a strap connecting the two pillows together, and I wish it were removable so that you could use just one pillow at a time if you wanted. With our son's car seat (a Britax) there wasn't enough room to use both pillows at once. The product seemed well made, it just didn't work great for our needs."
1,Doesnt stay in place or do anything for my child,So I bought this for my 3 year old son who is in a backless booster seat thinking it would help. It doesnt it connects to the back of the seat and nothing holds the pillow parts it in place it just kinda hangs there my sons fallin asleep with this and its no where near his head I tried pinning it to the seat and it just cant be placed right dont waste ur $
1,Not what it appears to be,I bought this and tried it one time to see if it would work. My son's head still flopped all over the place. It only works until they actually fall asleep. Don't be swayed by the photo like me.
1,Is this really a regency?,"There are a number of reasons I love regency novels. One big one is that usually there is very little sexual talk and sex in general. Not in this book. Very disappointing. I've read other of Heath's books and enjoyed them, so I was excited to read another. But it was full of sex! Come on. Do we really need that to have a good story? Especially back then. Let's keep them clean, like good ol' Jane Austin, Charles Dickens, etc. We need more good clean books. We have enough filthy ones! Keep them clean!"
3,YDAN - SO SO,"The music may be my favorite part. The exercises should be conducted privately otherwise you may feel like an idiot doing them. I think there is some value in this type of exercise if done quite religiously and it will certainly build endurance over the long run in that case. For those seeking a very gentle and somewhat aesthetic workout this may be just the ticket. For my money, its still Paul Gaudino all the way!"
3,"LEGO Vikings are great, but you get what you pay for!","I am an adult LEGO fan and I mainly buy the LEGO Star Wars line. I was somehow drawn to this new Vikings line, however, and I love 'em!This particular set is the cheapest an smallest. The wolf is not that great of a creature, especially compared to the dragons in the more expensive sets.I have all the Vikings sets and your best bets are the Viking Fortress ($70), Viking ship ($50), and the Viking Catapult w/ Dragon ($20). The Viking boat is also a good deal for $10.00.This little set is my least favorite of the Vikings line, but was the only one keeping me from completing all the sets."
4,"Sound is fine. These are demos, after all.","A few folks have complained about the sound on this. (These are demos, so I don't know what they were expecting!) It's not THAT bad. These rough low-fi demos are a real treat for any Squeeze-aholic. Hearing what the ""East Side Story"" songs were like before they were re-worked. Hearing Glenn's vocal for ""Tempted"" and the slightly-up-beat ""Labelled With Love"" are only two of the many highlights. If there's any complaints, the packaging is kinda flimsy and (worst of all) there is no demo for ""Piccadilly""! Oh well.Can't wait for the next installment of Tilbrook's demos. Way to go, mate!"
1,Depends,ONLY by if you know how to play music and are REALLY good at it!! This is a music book!!For piano and other musical instruments. Very hard do not suggest it to ppl who don't know how to play music that well>
5,Great watch for the price,"I bought this watch a year and a half ago, and have worn it almost everyday since. First of all, the styling of the watch is such that it looks like an expensive watch. Secondly, the maintenance free solar-recharged battery is outstanding. Third, it is comfortable and you forget you have it on.You could spend 3 times this and not get as nice looking of a watch, and have to change batteries in it every 2 or 3 years. Or have to worry about winding it everyday. This watch makes me want to buy more Citizen Eco-drive watches!"
3,Great watch but... uncomfortable,"This watch is great to wear and can be worn on formal as well as casual outfits. I have no complains about the technology or the material. The only issue is that since I have hairy forearms and wrists, the hair get plucked when they are stuck between the links. This is very painful and irritating. I neglected this advice when I was looking at reviews but I had the same pitfall. Be advised, if you have hairy wrists, this may be a uncomfortable buy since you will wear it all the time."
3,heavier than expected,"heavier than expected, otherwise it OK. I returned it so I did not get a chance to see its performance"
4,Hubby wears it all the time,It's comfortable and fairly easy to adjust the band.. Looks nice but not too confusing in operation and easy to look at.
3,Item shipped with defect,"Really nice watch, but the one I received already contained scratches on the face!I returned the watch and purchased another casio eco-drive with a sapphire crystal face."
4,Great Watch For The Price.,"First - their were only 2 small things that keep this from being a 5 star watch. 1, the band occasionally but painfully pulls hair, and 2, the band clasp says made in China. That said, I wanted an understated watch that wasn't flashy but would feel like quality on my wrist and this delivers. I've had it just over 3 weeks and it gained 5 seconds. You can pause the second hand for 5 seconds once a month if you need to be perfect. The watch was lighter than I expected - but for me that was a good thing - the watch case itself is thinner than I expected so if you like a thicker watch, read the measurements carefully - I had to remove 3 links to get a fit on my 7.5 inch wrist. I suspect if you have a large wrist in comparison to mine, this watch will look smallish, even feminine."
5,Good all-round watch,"Prior to buying this Citizen Eco-Drive Titanium watch, I must confess I was tempted to buy one of those tough-looking Luminox watches, but after spending some time to read the reviews, I decided to search for a titanium watch at Amazon.com, and voila!, it directed me to this baby!This watch is stylish yet rugged enough for me in the sense that it was constructed of titanium & mineral crystal, it powers itself from ambient light, and is around $100.00 cheaper than all-carbon fiber Luminox watches. I don't know if the mineral crystal is scratch resistant or not, but it seemed OK after I accidentally scratched the watch against door pane, table, etc.I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone who wants to be free from the hassle of changing battery every 2 - 5 years."
5,I like it!,"I have had this watch for a few weeks now so I can not address wear and tear. To start, the picture does not do it justice. The titanium is a nice mix of brushed and polished, which does not stand out in the pic. The black face is very pretty, not a dull/flat black or a shiny black - it is hard to explain except that I am very happy with it. Also, from the picture I was concerned that the numbers 6, 9 and 12 were too large, but in person they look proper and in-scale with the rest of the face. The watch diameter is also in good ratio to my arm/wrist and I am average height and weight.The band wear and tear seems similar to a stainless steel band. The mechanism is almost silent and the time keeping seems very accurate. I have not had any bumps to the watch face so I can't say how hard it is to scratch the crystal, but I assume this is a lower end crystal since it is ""mineral"" and not sapphire.I would recommend this watch to any man. It is sexy and is a good price for a Citizen Eco-drive."
5,Eco Drive is NOT a hoax,"Unless something has changed over the past thirteen years, which is how long I have had my Citizen, the Eco-Drive is not a hoax. In fact, this has been the most accurate and reliable watch I've ever owned. The only thing that I have had to do over that time is to replace the pins in the titanium band. The gold on the band and face of the watch has even remained, which is no small accomplishment because I almost never take it off.To clarify, I don't have this specific model. I don't remember the name of my model but it has a rotating dial with various cities around the world plus the ability to select those cities in the small digital display. I would absolutely buy my watch again."
1,Scratches,Watch looks great until you wear it a few days and start to notice the scratches on the band. I work in an office setting and cannot figure out why the band has so many scratches.They are tiny scratches that when all combined makes the watch band look very dull. Gets worse daily. I have only had this watch for a month and wish I had one with a leather band. I do not recommend this watch.
3,Extra cost for resizing,"The watch seems nice enough. I had another ecodrive for many years, but it eventually needed repairs that cost more than the watch. However, I was able to resize my previous ecodrive watch myself. This one requires additional time and expense to take it to a jeweler and have the band resized. The price you pay Amazon may not be what it really costs. Counting the time, I could have purchased the same watch at JCP and saved money."
5,Love it!!!!!!!,"Love this watch! I got it for my fiancee for Valentine's Day and he loved it! it works great, looks great! The warranty seems pretty good too!"
5,Great Watch,"For the past 2 years I have worn this watch and I love it. It has some wear and tear but it does not show many scratches even as my daily watch. The band has only gotten more smooth with time and the time piece has never failed me. I get complements all the time because people always think it is much more expensive that it is now and what is was when I got it (2010 MSRP: $325). Elegant,durable,refined quality time piece, you can't go wrong with Citizen."
2,Locking tailgate handle for Dodge by Bully doesn't fit a 2009,I ordered this item for my 2009 Dodge Ram 1500. No way will it fit. Found out later that this item if for 2010 - 2012 Dodge Rams. I returned it to Amazon for a full refund.
1,Caution!!!!!!!!!!,Contrary to what the manufacturer and amazon claim this does NOT fit a 2009 ram 1500. Beware if you own this vehicle.
4,Does the Job,"The original tailgate handle was plastic on my truck, and was replaced by this plastic handle with a lock. I think someone had said about how it's cheap plastic, but the original was made the same way. Is it bulletproof? NO, but neither was the one that came with the truck. It's to stop honest thieves, the ones that just though ""Hey that truck tailgate is open, maybe I will take something"" and hopefully will keep them out. It was super easy to install! Takes minutes with a cordless drill and the right bit, and probably double the time with caveman tools. I suggest it for anyone that carries expensive items in their truck, or doesn't want their tailgate stolen."
5,Bully Tail Gate Lock,"The bully tail gate lock is a great new addition to your truck. I purchased this for my 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 and love it, installation is supper easy and it looks just like the factory tail gate handle with a lock added to it. Construction of the item is comparable or equal to that of the OEM original. I have found nothing wrong with this product and would highly recommend it."
4,As expected,Easy install. Only thing is it sticks out slightly from the tailgate but not enough to notice unless you're looking for it. .
1,Bad Amazon description,"I had to send this back, because the Amazon description is so bad. It fits Dodge Ram 1500 for LATER years, not earlier. Before buying one of these, make sure it fits your truck. I bought this one, read the package, called the manufacturer, and learned that I needed LH-006 rather than this one. Once I got the right one, it worked fine."
1,Major disappointment,"I was totally disappointed in this movie. It was a show that followed Steve-O around on tour. There weren't many stunts and the female nudity was over the top. When it came to the male nudity, it was all fuzzed out. What is up with that? Shame on the makers of the movie. What is good for the goose, is good for the gander. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. It is a total disappointment."
5,Steve-O Uncensored,"Being a hardcore Steve-O fan, I had to run out and get his new release. You really get a good inside look at how he is and what he is like. It made me want him even more! Oh and it was more disgusting and hilarious then any jackass or wildboyz show ever."
1,So sad,I own all three videos also and this is THE WORST. I own all 4 cky dvds too and they are gold. The cky movies have great editing great music and great music. This dvd is just a bunch of . . . well nothing there are maybe 2 new stunts everything else is old boring stunts done better on jackass cky or from the first 2 dvds. I agree this is the most boring 2 hours iv spent watching a movie. The movie wasnt even over yet and i was begging for it to end. It has the worst editing iv ever seen. Please skip this video.
5,Great DVD.,"This DVD is very funny. Steve-O does some crazy things that makes him, him. This DVD has everyone from Jackass in it and there are a lot of things going on. There are stunts being done, and drugs being taken/smuggled.Great for a Steve-O/Jackass fan!"
2,Good and bad.,"i expected this to be great,but it wasnt.this is basically a movie about drunks and pot smokers filmin stuff so they get payed tons of cash to do it all again.this movie lacks stunts,but if u consider being drunk and tearin up hotels a stunt then theres plenty.steve-o is crazy though i tip my hat of to him for doin the crazy stuff he does,but theres to much attention on the other losers in the film-nick dunlap(dumb ass idiot)and his crew.(...).but after u see the same old stunts the first hundred times it gets real boring.steve-o has more talent he just needs to think of better and more stunts.hopefullyvolume four will be better."
3,"STEVEO, read this !","First STEVEO video was great, second was produced by Nick Dunlap and started to become worst but it was still good stuff.The third is still VISIBLE but we want to see STEVEO, not its co-partners ! and surely not his pathetic video producer !STEVEO is a funny crazy guy, everything he does even if its really stupid would be funny as this guy is a REAL CLOWN !But his co-partners are just drunk loosers that you can find in any PARTY.First videos had 90% of STEVEO, Second video had 75% and now this one has only 50% of STEVEO action.STEVEO ! We want you back ! You can put a bit of your co-partners, but not so much ! As they are really not as good as you especially NICK !"
5,Steve-O Rocks,"I have the first two and and they rock, I just got this one and its definitely the best one yet, obviously all the gross out humor is there but he definitely steps it up this time. It has good length too, I thought it was never gonna end, can't wait for steve-o 4! extras and bonus dvd rock also! well worth the money if you like this garbage and I do!!"
4,mikes opinion,this was good i had a laugh alot of times but some parts are a little boring like in the begining they just party around but in the middle a end its good at least its longer than the frist i got to check out vol 2 if you realy like jackass or steve o like i do get this dvd but a should warn you theres alot of nudity mostly women if you are a girl i wouldnt get this
5,Nice,"If you like to see people get drunk and make a complete fool of themselves. Buy this, it's awesome & Wee Man drunk?(I could watch that all day)"
5,Easy to install seems to work perfectly,This cutter fits the manual Trim Pro from RCBS. Thought my 7 year old cutter was getting a little dull. Several thousand rounds trimmed before replacing. Easily installs and works as designed.
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered a RCBS Trim Pro Manual Case Trimmer with a picture and a description of the item. When I finally got the item it was a RCBS Trim Manual Case Trimmer replacement cutter, which wasn't anything like the picture and the description and it was certainly not what I wanted or ordered.Beware of the seller."
4,Cig. Lighter,"Works great...easy installation. Finish on mounting bracket was a little scratched. Item was mounted in an inconspicuous way, so it wasn't of big importance."
4,Provides reasonable answers,"From when I was a small child to sometime in my college years, I believed in UFO's, aliens etc... Slowly, as I gained knowledge in science, especially physics, and grew in my faith, the ideas of intelligent alien life became more difficult to rationalize.I couldn't just dismiss all the claims though. They couldn't ALL be weather balloons could they? I've seen interesting videos and heard some very chilling accounts. So, if even a very small fraction of these UFO's cannot be explained away, where does that leave us, especially as Christians?Hugh Ross tackles that question in a concise and well-written book. He explains what could be happening with that small amount of ""encounters"" that cannot be explained."
2,Interesting,"The information is compelling and intersting. The language is a little technical and deep for me (fine arts major) however. It is more suited for scientists, engineers, etc. My father liked the book (nuclear engineer) and my brother did too (mechanical engineer)."
3,Earth IS alone in the universe,"The most interesting parts of this book to me are located in the Appendix.There the author lists and explains the scientific conditions that have to be exactly right for life to exist on earth, what he calls ""Fine-tuning for Life on Earth.""There are so many conditions; astronomical and gravitational and chemical and atomic and others, that it does become clear that we are indeed unique in the universe.I've read some of these conditions in other places, but this book seems to describe all of them in one place.Fascinating... and convincing."
2,Good idea on UFO; weird on Spirits,"I agree that the UFO reports are hoaxes or natural events that seem like they may be from another world but can easily be explained to someone who is confused. However, now the authors enter the world of mythology/religion as an answer to some of the reports, especially contact with beings from another world. Let's get a grip, both the UFO (by those believers) and ""spirit"" (by the myth/religion believers) answers that are out there are both FALSE! Read a little in science and take a deep breath, as well as putting aside your mythology/religious cult bibles, and you may overcome your fantasies."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping to find an enlightened view of the larger truth from a fellow Christian. Instead I discovered strongly biased illogic that led me to the dead end of demonic projections.I was hoping to find Christian love. Instead I found a point of view that despised any who thought differently than the authors.I was hoping to find hope and acceptance. Instead I found condemnation of the experiences of thousands of honest, knowledgeable, fellow human beings.I was disappointed."
1,Not so cool....,"This Ryuk plush is super small. Probably about 5 inches. He is not to durable, and his colors are dull. I was not satisfied with this plush. So he is now sitting in a box somewhere in my basement. :("
3,Sides fold in too easily,"The corners need something to make them rigid. The dog leans on the side and it slides into a mishapen odd cage that I have to keep pushing back into a square. Needs improvement and rigidity! I like it having no top (unlike another viewer) as then I can easilily lift the dog out to play with as I have more than one in there. It looks nice, the door is double-latched and secure and not having a bottom is good for less cleaning of the cage and easy instant storage if needed. Plus it doesn't scratch my tile like the metal ones did. It's just that darn rigidity of the corners that take it down 2 notches in my opinion!"
5,5 Pound Pomeranian Initially used as a Pen Now use as a gate,I have a pomeranian just under 5 pounds. I purchased two and put them together to be used as a pen when she wasn't potty trained and I wasn't home. Now that she is potty trained in two adjoining rooms I use it as a gate to keep her out of the other rooms. I needed a long gate to separate her from the other rooms and it has worked out fine. We can step over it. My dog can't get over it. My two cats can jump over it which is good. I recommend this pen for a small animal. It has worked out great for me.
1,Waste of my money,"My 4.5 month old yorkie, can stand up with his paws on the edge, and clear it in no time. Defeats the purpose of the pen. Not sure what kind of dog it can keep in except a tea cup breed."
2,Doesn't stay in Place,"It is very difficult to put the door on and the locks don't work well. My puppy already knows how to unlock it so it stays shut. Plus, I have to put heavy rubbermaid bins around it to keep her from pushing it all over the place. If you have a dog that never tries to get out it might work but it is not as secure as a crate.It does look very nice though and the panels are easy to aseemble."
1,Didn't work,"If you have a small dog, do not bother with this product. We tried it first without the top cover and he was able to get out. We then purchased the top cover and he was able to pull the velcro attachments and once again get out. Larger dogs could easily get out either by jumping out or possibly knocking it over. Could possibly work as a child playpen, but I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry but just sharing my honest opinion."
5,Puppy Playpen,"We had tiny chihuahua puppies and this is the perfect size....I do think that bigger puppies would probably need the 8 sided version as it is pretty small. It is durable, washable and so easy to put together, move, lay flat etc etc. Great product!!"
4,Great Play Pen,"This play pen was exactly what we needed. We have a three month old Cane Corso and needed to keep him caged up when we weren't home. He loves to go sleep in there during the day even though he's allowed to roam the house. He is getting bigger and can jump up and stand to reach the top. He can move the sides, but he only does that when he sees food and really wants out. I like that you can take apart the sides and use it to block other areas. We take four panels out and block the top of our deck stairs so the dog can roam the deck. We are very happy with our purchase and would recommend this product."
2,This pen needs a roof!,"This petpen takes a few seconds to assemble and is quite sturdy. I purchased this product to keep my puppy in, while I do house chores. However, my 11-week-old Papillon puppy (2.7 lbs) crawls up and over the pen every time I put her in, so I don't have any use for it anymore. Because of the arch shape on top, it's not even easy to cover with anything to prevent her from climbing. I completely underestimated the power of a tiny puppy. So if you need a pen for a puppy, you might consider buying one that has roof."
3,should be higher,"I have a toy chihuahua and she has no trouble getting out. I have a pilllow and her food in it and it gives her a second place to ""hide out"" but it should be high enough so that a little dog should not be able to climp out. It would probably be fine for new puppies."
3,For dogs 5lbs or less,"My dog (10 yr old Dash) is very docile and will only do what's easiest for her, she won't even get on & off a chair without someone picking her up. But she easily gets out of this pen by lifting it off the ground even when the door is open, she routinely piles toys all over it but rather than move them to get to the door she just lifts the side of the pen with her nose. I wouldn't rec for anyone with a dog over 5lbs or not seriously arthritic. If you need to confine your dog while you're at work or to protect areas during potty training this is not it! We use it just to keep all the doggie toys, bed & what not contained to one area. She does consider it home but it's not secure."
1,Too small for even a small puppy,"Our dog despises when he has be in this pet pen. He cries, claws and his 5 pound stature can move this pen all over the floor, which of course scratches the floor. The inferior space is not large enough for a small puppy bed, potty pad and food/ water dish. He is so stressed out when he is in this pen, which surprised us, as he loves his crate. If the 8 panels pen also had a roof....as our puppy can jump out....that would have been a much better choice. I would not recommend this product."
3,I wish I would have read the negative reviews a little closer,"Its a great product, its well built and a really good size for a small dog but not if you have a spider-doggie. My chihuahua figured out how to get out of this pen after a few weeks. And she only weighs 2 and 1/2 pounds and it is very easy for her. We tried putting things like blankets over the top but it did very little good to stop her."
5,Very pleased,"I ordered 2 complete pens to keep a Schnauzer puppy in until he is house trained. The pen is sturdy, very handy, easy to clean and portable. I have also used it set up in the back of my SUV to take him places so he would not have to stay in a kennel for long periods. It comes apart very easy and can be used in part or parts to block off doorways or other things. I can see many uses even when he house trained. I would highly recommend the pen."
1,Not as expected,I was really hoping for a nice sturdy pen for my small dogs based on all the glowing reviews on this site. I was very disappointed with the reality of this purchase. The material is lightweight plastic- very lightweight. It has no bottom- not that I expected it to- but this adds to the pen being pushed around on my laminate floor by my average size pug.I usually do not take the time to write a review good or bad. Look elsewhere for a pen.
1,No way would this pen hold any dog,"This was the flimsiest piece of junk ever. Reviews claiming that it holds their 50lbs rambunctious puppy must be fake, or the product has been redesigned. After assembly, even the lightest touch knocked this over. The pen either would tip over or fold in on itself. On top of the poor quality of the product, the return shipping through UPS is obscene -- it will cost over half the original price of the pen.I'm not sure how so many people can give this product such a positive review..."
2,Falls Short of Expectations,"After reading all the reviews, I was convinced this would be perfect for the new 3 month old pug coming to live with us. WRONG. First, she knocks against it to push it out of shape. So I found a few heavy boxes to put around it. The next day she figured out how to CLIMB OUT OF IT using the lower corners and putting her feet in the grates. So we bought window screen last night and zip-tied it over the top. Well today we come home to find she has escaped again. This time by repeatedly knocking against the door until the latch screws loosened and latches open, even when you hand screw them tightly closed."
2,Your Dog Will Eventually Climb Out,"Durable material. Easy to assemble. Aesthetically pleasing. However, your dog will eventually find a way to climb out. My 3lbs Maltipoo did on the first night. I will be returning the item."
3,"Works great for puppy, but arrived broken","Easy to set up, and works great to contain our yorkie puppy; however, one of the panel's grid broke at the top during shipment. If it had broken at the bottom, we would not have been able to use it due to the sharp edges."
3,Not the greatest investment,"My 8 week Chihuahuha was able to climb and jump out of this thing like it was no ones business. So if you have a persistent jumper like I do, stay away. On the other hand, it was very easy and fast to put together."
1,Easy for dog to get out,My 10 month old poodle got out and scooted this thing around so easy. All it is good for is a dog under 6 lbs.
3,"Sturdy, hard to stow, doesn't stake into the ground.","Thought I could stake this in the yard and put my pets in it, but the rods don't go down far enough like the picture shows. The plastic is heavy duty, but, if I could go back, I'd get a wire pen. This one doesn't stow easily and it's awkward to move around or put in another room; it's too bulky."
3,whelping pen for yorkies,"I bought this product to use inside the house for my whelping yorkshire terrier. She had five puppies a few weeks ago.I thought the plastic design would be perfect for indoors. It does not scratch the flooring, but unless you set the panels up so that they are all bent at angles, the walls will bend inwards. I have the 8 panel pen and I wanted to make a box shape. This is not possible. When I tried it, the walls leaned inwards and I thought it would collapse on itself. Now that I have an octagon type shape the walls do not bow inwards, but I would not buy this product again. Safety is a big issue for me, and this just is not safe in my opinion for baby dogs.Positives: It only took 3 minutes to put the panels together, and another 5 minutes to fasten the door to the frame."
2,"Would be a great pen, if it were a little more durable.",My puppy tore through it and broke it in about 30 seconds. Just one attempt to jump at the enclosure walls and they were on the ground. Had to replace it with a wire pen. It might work well for dogs that don't attempt any form of an escape.
4,Better than my other one,This plastic one beats the pants off my old metal one. Much lighter but sturdy enough. Came with 8 panels but I only use 6 to form a rectangle which fits the space I have. The oles that hold the panels together acually double as a ground stake if you want to put outside.All the hinge openings align up so the palnels slip together easily.I have another cage that similar style but metal. This is much easier to handle. No question this one looks much better.We have small dogs so this is perfect. Good value
2,Cute but not all that!,"Both of my 8 wk old shih tzu's can climb out of this. It's a very cute play pen but design wise it lacks. I think the horizontal bars are too close together for puppies to use as a ladder and climb out of it.Instead of using it as a playpen, I'll use 2 pieces to block the doorway or part of a room when needed and that works great!"
3,My Houdini puppy,I have a 5lb puppy that can climb out of the pen by getting his paws on the cross bars. But other than that its a great pen.
2,Flimsy,"The biggest problem is this four sided unit tends too lean into a diamond shape when my dog leans against it. I also agree with another persons comment that it needs a top cover, as stated the dog can just climb right out which my dog does."
2,A puppy can easily climb out of this,"It took my 4 month old pug about 10 minutes to figure out how to climb out of the pen, so I had to return this. I wouldn't recommend this for active and curious dogs. The only other negative is that the latches on the door were very small and hard to open. In terms of the structure, the pen is built of a sturdy plastic which is nice. Also it easily collapses so it's not a problem to move the pen around."
4,"Should work well as a pen, but not as a barrier.","I have a large (~8 ft), irregular opening between my kitchen and dining room and I wanted a barrier to block my greyhound out while she's home alone. Thought this might work if I opened it length-wise and blocked the opening. It did for a while until she realized she could push it aside and get past it. Oh well. But it wasn't marketed as a barrier, so I can't hold that against it. I think if you were using as a pen for a small dog it would work well. Lightweight, durable, easy to put together. And a good price."
3,great if your puppy doesnt learm how to climb out,"My little 4 pound Yorkie did well in this the first 3 days. Then on the forth day she managed to jump/climb out! Beware of this, were going to try to find something to cover and secure the top"
1,Easy to climb out,"Yes, my 11 week old shih-poo weighing 3 lbs climbs out easily (like a ladder)everytime he's left in it and trash my house!. I had to go to Home Depot and spend and extra $30 on a radiator cover to cover the top so he can't climb out. My advice: Buy one with NO horizontal bars!"
1,Useless without a top,Bought this for a 10 week old puppy (mid-size dog). She was able to jump/climb over with ease. I cant see how this would keep anything but the smallest dogs.
1,A Ladder for your pup....,"I bought this with high hopes since I was picking up my 8 week old lab. I got it, assembled it and had it all ready for my new pup. Within 30 minutes he was able to get out although I did not see how. Over the course of 2 days he got out many times. The walls have verticle and horozontal bars, not rounded but flat. The horizontal bars that are FLAT act like ladder steps and what my little guy did was to use his back paws and climb. He got to the top and pushed himself over landing on his head. Luckily, I have carpet. The design is terrible and I doubt it was tested with pups. Perhaps if the bars were rounded??? or if the walls were a solid design with holes in them like metal beams but what they designed does not work.Mine is goin gabck tomorrow...."
5,Flexible Pet Pen,This is the most flexible and practical pet pen or fence depending on your need for containment of your pet. This is our third purchase which give us lots of options andhow we connect them together.
2,Iris CI-604 Not worth the trouble.,"I bought this for my new Papillon puppy for indoor/outdoor use. The stakes that are supposed to be able to go into the ground are too short! They don't even reach the floor! There is no way to cover the top thus it is easy for a puppy to jump out or climb out! In addition, when using indoors the pen can slide around on carpet. I ended up purchasing a different kennel, pen. I would not recommend this to anyone who has a puppy or dog that is at all active. The idea is a good one however they need to go back to the drawing board and make it possible to have a cover for the top and stakes that do the job they say they will do. I am very dissapointed in this product!"
3,Nice and roomy but too short,"I got this for my 3 month old bicheon poodle mix puppy. It is easy to setup, looks good and roomy, and also sturdy. But it is too short, it took my puppy only two days to learn how to climb out of it. I think this is a good product for a dog that does not jump or climb."
4,Great for my Chihuahua/Jack Russell puppy,"This pen is great for Chloe to have her own little area. Her crate fits nicely in one corner leaving plenty of room for her bowls, toys, and peepad. My 15 year old was able to assemble in it in less than 5 minutes and it's very light weight."
3,Iris Plastic Pet Pen,"I liked this product, except the panels we a little to high for me, it's very easy to assemble, overall I liked it for it's purpose to keep my 8 week old puppy confined in an area large enough for her to sleep, play, eat, and potty train on wee wee pads."
5,Best purchase for our puppy!,"We purchased this Pet Pen for our Samoyed puppy for inside the house. Sammy's get big fast, but so far so good! Our puppy is now 13 weeks and almost 20 pounds and the pen works great! He is able to have a larger area in the house and we don't have to worry about ""accidnets!"" can't say anything bad about it!"
5,great product!,This pen works great for my 10 lb Shih Tzu. Good quality and also no assembly needed!!! Worth every penny.
3,Good product but....,I spent 30 minutes removing the hinges 3 times and replacing them trying to follow the instructions and the predrilled holes concerning these hinges. It is as though the product was created in one part of the world and the instructions in another part of the world and neither talked to each other. I finally gave up and realized that I must drill my own holes in order to make the door work as intended. This is just to give others a warning so they don't get as frustrated as I did. With the one that was sent to me you do not and can not use the predrilled holes for the hinges. Even the physical pictures vary from each other showing the finished product. Now that I got that off my chest the completed product is great and I wish I could give it 4 or 5 stars.
5,LOVE IT!,"We could not be happier with our Iris-CI-908! Our 10 week old Cairn Terrier has plenty of room to play and run around but there is also room for her crate and food. I hesitated whether to get the 4 or 8 panel and am so glad I got the 8. It breaks down easy, its lightweight, and doesnt tip over. Can also be converted into many shapes. Its great while we are away at work and even in the evenings she can be where we but just not unattended. Best purchase EVER!"
5,Must have item!,"I purchased this for my 8 week old yorkie mix. There's plenty of room for a bed, wee wee pad, food and toys. The door comes in handy for my three year old to let our puppy out, she can't reach her other wise. The box arived open but I was pleased to see everything was there. It's easy to put together but an automatic screw driver will make it easier. I searched everywhere and Amazon had the best price I could find and free shipping too."
4,Dog Gate,I purchased this product to help introduce my labradoodle to our new chiweenie puppy. It's more open than a kennel. I used it in a rectangular configuration with her bed at one end and her pee pad tray at the other and it has worked out perfectly.
5,We love this....,"I order this Pet Pen after my dog had her puppies, It is so wonderful.I will order more side panels now the puppies are growing up."
5,Love This!,"I purchased this to use as a playpen for our new puppy. From the beginning he went in the open door to rest or play. This is a tool for me when I need to do things where a puppy underfoot would be unsafe. As long as I am within his sight, he is content in there. He does have a small area with his crate for when he is alone, but when family is home and is not interacting or able to supervise, this is great!"
3,A nice product but flawed for a larger-breed puppy,"The reason I'm not giving this a 1 is that it is well-made, attractive, light, and easy to take apart and put back together. The problem is that it is also easy to climb out of if one is an eight week old Golden Retriever. She can just barely reach and hold on to the top rail when she is stretched out as far as she can. Then the back legs come up and find good footing on the second rail up from the bottom and it doesn't take much time from that point. The worst part is that she is then up 24 inches and the trip down is not nearly as gentle as the trip up. It actually works quite well when I am sitting next to her and can discourage her plans, but unattended it would only work on a much smaller puppy. Only a barrier without horizontal rails would work for mine."
2,This isn't working very well for my puppy.,"At only 9 weeks of age, my little puppy is already climbing out of this pen. As a safety issue, I cannot leave her in there unsupervised.My other disappointment with this item was having to assemble the door. The tiny screws were difficult to insert into the plastic holes, and we ended up stripping the screws and having an unusable door. It would be helpful to have the hardware installed at the factory.For me, this product was a waste of money."
5,Pet pen perfect,I purchased 2 pet pens so I could combine them to make a small run for my cats. We zip tied a plastic mesh top and it's great. I can escort the cats outside and know they are safe. They are indoor cats except when they are in the run.
3,Very Disappointed,I bought this for my 15 week old Toy Fox Terrier and she climbed out the first time we put her in it. There should at least be an accessory to put over the top for these little climbers. It is also always loses its shape. A removable bottom as an option would be great too. I feel like I wasted my money!
5,Puppy Playpen,This is a really nice pen for puppies or older dogs. It is a great item to have when you do not want your furkid underfoot. I bought mine to put my pups that I am selling in when people come to look at them. It would be nice to find a bottom pan that would work for this especially when using it for pups that are not potty trained. I recommend this to anyone with furkids!
5,Great Crate !!!,This is one of the best things I've ever bought for use with my dogs. I have a seven year old that recently went through surgery to repair two ruptured discs in her spine and she needed to be kept somewhat confined for a short period of time. This worked out perfectly. I have nothing bad to say about this item.
4,pet kennel,This kennel is very easy to set up. It is also very child friendly. I highly recommend it to anyone who has pets and children.
4,Great and light weight plastic dog oen,great pen for puppiies or small dogs. You can bend over it or use the door for dogs to come and go as they like.I ordered 2 and they came right away have ordered 6 more they have been on back order for a month so far.
3,Ok for small breeds only!!,"Well live and learn. I thought I would save a few buck and purchased this kennel for a 9 week old Doberman puppy.....not a good idea! Within two days the puppy figured two ways out, not just one way to get out/over this kennel. He learned that if he stands up on his hind legs and pushes, the opposite side will raise up and eventually get lodged or caught on anything you place inside…i.e. water or food bowls. Then the pup, with very little effort and time could wedge himself under the opening to freedom. Secondly, the slats or bars are spaced just far enough apart for him to climb up any side and eventually get his mid section over the top and he just tumbled out, which didn’t seem to affect him in the least, he was happy (and proud), he was out!!"
3,Its Ok,"This is a sturdy pet pen and a good one for the outdoors. I unfortunately thought it would be a good play pen for my dogs inside the house and it was actually too big for my place. The panels are quite long on each side. Other than that, its a great pen for people who live in a larger home and have the space to spare."
3,Just okay.,"I was super excited to order this product after reading the great reviews. Unfortunately, after receiving the product, I am disapointed. The pen is way too small. I have a four pound puppy, and her bed and puppy pad barely fit in the pen. I have no clue how people are squeezing labs and larger dogs into this pen. I have a larger pen made by Top Paw that is much more sturdy and spacious. I keep my puppy in the Top Paw pen during the day while I am at work, and I keep her in the Iris pen at night to sleep. Overall, this pen does look nice and is sturdy, but is a bit too small for our needs.*EDIT* After posting this review, I noticed that you could order the 4 OR 8 panel pen. I wish I would have realized this when I ordered my pen. I have purchased two more panels in hoped of making the Iris pen a bit more spacious."
5,Shape changing ease,"We love this for our standard poodle puppy. The long pins that hold each section to the next pull out so easily - I can move the pen to another room within 3 minutes. And once together, it can be moved to any shape desired. The materials are very high quality - better than I expected for the price."
3,Little Disappointed,The pens were easy to put together and are fine for little toy breed puppies but they are wobbly when put together. I wanted them for outside and have to put two together to make one big enough for what I want to use them for. They will work for the adult dogs I have taught not to climb but for people with bigger pups and grown dogs they will not work very good. The caps on some of the pins to hold them together keep coming off. They really make the yard look nice compared to other pens we have made ourselves or bought.
3,Nice Pen But...,"My 4.4pd Yorkie-Poo gets out of this pen everyday when I arrive home from work!! It is very annoying!! We tried to cover the top of the pen with cardboard and I Figured out my lil fur baby still gets out by climbing his way up thru the holes. Im looking to buy another pen that has a closed in top. This pen is nice looking and very steardy but not that tall in height. The Pen is definitely made for very, very small breeds such a teacups size pups. The pen came in handy when my pup was just a couple months old and under 4pds."
5,A Neat Little Portable Pen.,Even though our dog has a larger dog run this pen is convenient to move him with us to locations in the front and back yards as we do projects and for taking him out for picnics and visits. We don't have to worry about him running off when we are busy or about larger animals harrassing him.
2,easy for dogs to jump over top,"It was extremely sturdy but that is the only good thing I can say about it. Very disappointed, thought it was a great concept. My 3 mo. old yorkie mix learned to jump out within days of getting it. It might work better for fat dogs who can't jump or climb over, or for those who could just care less about trying. I did not try the cover...maybe for the extra money it might work. I ended up spending even more money on a sturdy wire kennel, but it works fine and my puppy is safe when we go out."
5,little darlings,I love this pen! I bought one and loved it soo much my daughter bought one for her dogs. It's very portable because it breaks down into individual panels and reassembles easily. Quick and easy!!! Sturdy and light weight!! My only regret is the extra panels you can buy too make it larger are too expensive to expand the size of the pen when adding extra dogs (like when my company visit). The price of the four panel pen is very reasonable.
4,puppy pen,"This product is great until the puppy gets a little bigger and stronger, at least inside the house, they can then climb over it and move it.However outside it stakes into the ground and can't be moved,however they still can get over the top."
5,Great For Small Dog,I have a 2 lb puppy and this pen works great for her. It gives her enough room to feel comfortable while I am gone for 12 hr. shifts. Easy set up and is very sturdy.
5,What a neat item,"We got this to put our new puppy in when we go rving alot of people have asked where we got it. So easy to put together, we keep it in our Rv ,great product!"
5,pleasant confinement,"The Iris pet pen setup is wonderful! It is versatile and the dogs don't mind going in at all. It gives them plenty of room for their kennel, water bowls and a pee pad, if needed. I bought this one to use with one of my Papillons diagnosed with cervical disc disease to keep him gently confined. It was perfect for our needs and is portable to have taken on vacation for the same purpose. I'm planning on buying another set."
3,Works - Kind of...,"I bought this pen for my 14 week old Shih Tzu. The breeder kept her in one exactly like this with the extra panels and had NO PROBLEMS. When I put her in it during the day, by herself now that she had been taken from her litter mates, she JUMPED it each time. She is only 5.5 lbs and very small but had no problem getting over it easily. I am using it in the bedroom at night to surround her doggie bed to teach her where she is supposed to stay during the night and it works perfectly for that. It's well made, nice looking and sturdy but as others have already listed, not so hard for even a small dog to escape from easily."
3,Plastic Pet Pen,"If you have to have one of these in the house, this looks nice and doesn't make the place look like a kennel. Easy to put together. Unfortunately, my 11 week old puppy climbed out in less than 10 seconds. Not meant for active dogs - easy to climb up on the bars."
5,excellent for puppies!,"This is perfect for my two baby yellow labs. It's easy to assemble, and easy to take apart. Mine is in my kitchen, and when I need to get something, I just pull out the stick and it folds nicely. I'm very happy with this purchase!"
5,Very pleased!,"The pen arrived quickly (within a couple of days) but is shipped in the product box so if you're buying it as a gift for someone keep that in mind. There is a bit of assembly with regards to the door. In total it took me about 20 minutes to unpack, put the door on and get totally set up. You also need a screw driver for assembly, as there isn't a small one included or anything. The pen is made in the USA and the box says it offers about 8 square feet. Overall, the product was exactly what I expected and looks great!"
5,Best pet pen for the money,"My wife and I needed a pet pen for out recovering dog. He doesn't like crates so we looked into these. This one is well constructed and is just the right size for our little dog Champ. It took no time to put together. Nice molded plastic, a gate with hinges and latches, and feet to protect our hardwood floors. Our dog loves it! And so do we. This was the best out of the several we looked at, and the price was better than the other pens. At $46.00, you can't go wrong. The size is perfect at 36"" (side to side and front to back) and 24"" high. I highly recommend it."
1,"List price 5,999.99???????","list price $5,999,99 Are you kidding! I realize this must be a mistake but seriously, fix it! This isn't funny"
1,Made in America,"That's too bad that it boasts ""Made In America"". When it came, the hinge parts for the door were missing."
3,It's too Floppy,I ordered 2 sets of the 4 panel. I love the design and the color but the crate is very light weight. I have mine against a wall on one side and used books on the other side to keep it from falling. Any determined dog can push this around and get out. I'm keeping mine because my dog is only 6 pounds and has short legs so he can't jump out.I wish the product was more sturdy.
2,Flimsy,"If you have a pet who is prone to jump up on the side of the pen, then this is not the play pen for you. Although it is attractive, it's very flimsy when shaped like a square or a rectangle."
2,Why doesnt this have a cover????,"My 7mo Shih Tzu LOVES this pen, but the purpose was to not crate her since she was rescued from being in a crate 20hrs a day and be able to finally potty train her. First day it arrived I thought this was it, the answer to my prayers so I can finally do right by her and get her trained! Nope.....took 10 minutes for her to figure how to climb out!"
2,Iris pet pen,The dog pen was easy to put together and of nice quality but my maltipoo can climb out of it. I can't find a cover to fit it. I bought it before I got the puppy and now it's been more than 30 days so I can't exchange it.I will have to buy a new pet pen with a cover. Too bad Iris doesn't make one.
3,Get a steel cage,"Got this for a 9 month old stray (small female dog 16 pounds) since my husband thought steel was too much like prison. She figured out how to jump out in a few days--so husband put a ""roof"" on it (plywood). She literally chewed her way out (chewed at the rungs until they gave way and then wiggled out--not just one rung--several were gone). So--husband went and got a steel cage. She is fine now!"
4,Awesome!!,"First of all, it came with a large furminator. By themselves, they are not cheap, so BIG bonus there!! After that, the pen has more than paid for itself as far as keeping my little pup contained. We use it indoors and outdoors. It has even replaced his crate at the end of the bed. My only complaint is it's not the most solid, but my puppy hasn't even come close to destroying or messing it up, so I guess it's ok for now. Good for small dogs or puppies. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a decent sized pen to hold your furry companion."
2,Not for everybody,"We purchased the smaller, 4-panel version. This pen is easy to set up, can be expanded, looks attractive and offers more room than the typical crate. The problem is that many dogs can easily escape. Our 12-week old, 5 pound puppy escaped the second night he was placed in the pen by launching himself up using the horizontal supports. It is totally useless to us now. Perhaps if you place a much younger puppy in the crate and he gets used to it before he can climb, this pen could work, but must puppies aren't available for adoption that early. It may also work for older dogs who are content staying where you put them. Since Amazon combines the reviews for the smaller pen and the larger version, many of the positive reviews may be for the larger version, which is about a foot higher and harder to climb out of."
4,Check your parts,"Very nice playpen for my two bouncy 6-lb. miniature pinschers. I'm confident they won't be about to jump out of this. It seems pretty sturdy and was easy to assemble.Two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: (1) The panels are awkwardly tall, making it impossible to step over if I need to go inside the pen to clean. Instead, I have to remove a connecting pin to to separate the panels so I can go in. Not that big a deal, but it's just an extra hassle for those days when I'm in a hurry. And (2) A latch piece for the gate was missing. I'm hoping the manufacturer will make good after I give them a call.Tip for floor protection: I'm using a rubber treadmill mat under it to protect from soils and scratches. The fit is just right for the 8 panel pen."
3,My dog climbed out!,I have a 7 week old Beagle puppy who scaled right over the top of it! No floor so she did her business on the kitchen floor. This is probably great for a small dog who is already trained...but then why would you need it?
5,Love it,"We moved into a new house and needed a spacious and comforting space for our chihuahua during the transition. We now use it when there are guests or anything we want to keep him out of- he's content and we are beyond happy. It's easy to assemble, light weight and gives you different size options."
5,Perfect for potty training toy dogs!,"just the right size for a puppy apartment! it is very well made and attractive. we have it set up in the living room for our new yorkie, added a piece of linoleum for a floor, and then put in her bed, food bowl, automatic waterer, a few toys and her medium sized potty pad. she always uses her potty pad when she's in there! (but never does when she's not, LOL) it is much more humane than keeping her in a crate constantly."
3,pen,"it's a nice product except for one thing. with the slots in the walls of pen, the dogs climb out."
5,would recommend to anyone with smaller type breed dog,"Easy to set up durable, just a little difficult to water or feed the pet from over the top of fence."
5,"Great just as described, love it!","I am very happy with this item,.So easy to put together, the door a bit tricky but still easy."
3,too light weight,gave to my brother for his minpin. dog escaped by knocking pen over. too lightweight to hold an active dog.
3,"Good pen, but for shorter less agile dogs.","I got this pen a few weeks ago, and it only took my toy poodle (about 8 inches tall) a little while to figure out how to jump out. I also have a Chinese Crested (about 7 inches tall) and he learned how to jump out too. I think it's a really nice looking and quality pen, but only get it if you have short, less agile dogs. My dogs are small, but good jumpers. I think it would be better for Shih tzus, daschunds, etc."
5,plastic pet pen,This little pet pen is just wonderful. I raise shih tzu puppies and I bought three of the pet pens. They're very easy to clean. To change the bedding I just put the clean bedding in a new spot and then just pick up the pen and put it on the clean bedding. Then I pick up the dirty bedding and throw it away. Next time I move it back to the original place and do the same thing all over again. It saves me a lot of time.
2,Disappointed,"Couldn't wait till I received it, set it up and immediately watched my Shih Tzu climb out of it in 4.3 seconds. What a let down."
1,Horrible and Unsafe,This item seemed great for the first week. Within days my 10 week old puppy was no longer safe as the item started cracking and leaving sharp edges that were unsafe. I even sustained a large scratch from a sharp piece of protruding plastic. I have since discarded of the item. Not happy at all.
5,Very Happy with Purchase - Works Great!,"I recently acquired a new puppy - I noticed that the breeder had a 4 panel puppy pen and thought it was a great idea. I found this item on Amazon and ordered one to set up in my kitchen. I put down a training pad, bed and two small bowls for food and water. I have a Yorkie, so this is plenty of space for him. I like the door - I can leave the door open when puppy is free to roam or shut it to limit access when I am too busy to monitor. This is a pen for smaller dogs or puppies - this will not contain a larger dog or a dog that can climb. I purchased the cover as well, for when I put puppy out on the patio to keep other criters out - it fits well but I haven't had to use it yet."
2,Suprised by good ratings,this thing was just not very good. Its real flimsy and just too cheap...the good reviews suckered me. My 15 pound chiweenie can lift this thing and toss it easy. I do use it for a gate now by propping it against her crate and a bookshelf so I guess its not a total loss.
4,RV Dog Lovers friend,"Got two sets of these to put up around the door of our RV. No tangled leash, no knocking over chairs, freedom to move around, perfect. I store them in the RV shower. They're light enough to move around easily. The bars on each panel make them good to configure and they're sturdy enough to not be easily knocked over if bumped.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the little plastic caps on the tops of the panel bars pop off so easily, I've just taken to throwing them away. They're only cosmetic, so the functionality is not impaired, but it's a little annoying."
5,awesome!,"I used these to contain a litter of lab pups until they were about 4 months old. The circular design keeps it from tipping over when they jump on the sides. But once they got over 30 pounds, I found that I needed to secure it to the wall because they would push it around the floor and then once they got to the couch, they could climb up and get out of it. What I did was unhook the panels and secure them with zip ties to a wire crate. That gave the pups the crate for a bedroom area and the play-yard for their pads and so forth. Secured to a wire crate, they could not drag it around because the crate was too heavy. I even bought two additional panels later when they were older and much larger. The only drawback to these is that they have a hollow construction on the interior which is a dust collector. However, just a squirt of household cleaner and a rinse with the hose and they are brand new again. Highly recommend."
5,Just received our second playpen,"This is a quality product, we've used our first playpen for both dogs and recently ordered a second so that each may have their own (yes, they are spoiled). Ideal for potty training and plenty of room for a smaller dog to be contained for an extended period when out of the house. We put a doggy bed in the playpen and there's still plenty of room."
5,love it!,I'm so excited for this Pet Pen ~ I set it up easily. It is sturdy & nicely built! Very satisfied with this product!
5,Plastic Dog Pen,We bought the pen for our dogs' use while we are camping. We actually used it on Halloween to keep the dogs in the garage while we gave out candy. They were able to see us so they didn't bark or whine when kids came up to trick or treat. We love the pen!
5,My three dogs love this dog pen!,"I have a Pomeranian, Maltese, and Maltipom....they share this pen for their naps and sleep through the night in the pen. They all are comfortable and enjoy being in there. Nicely made and sturdy. Two latches are on the pen, but I just lock the top one, there is no way they can undo the latch so no need to lock them both. I do wish it had a bottom. I use a bed sheet on the bottom and works fine though. I used to put them in their own cage, it is so much easier to put them all in the same pen now. I just say ok, time for a nap throw them all a treat and they are happy as can be :)"
4,Useful!,"I use this unconventionally: my 40lb lab mix puppy chews on absolutely everything, making it impossible for me to leave her unsupervised for even 5 minutes. With this product, I'm able to wall off entire sections of my house, sections which are much too large for normal pet gates, so she can play and run, but not get to those things she finds especially tasty, like my kitchen chairs. I do secure the ends because, since I'm using it like a wall, she could probably knock it over, although she hasn't managed to do so yet. I'm very pleased!"
5,Perfect for my bunny!,"I got a bunny a week ago and have a smaller cage for her so I wanted to get a pen for her to get out and play. I looked in pet stores and online and found that this was absolutely wonderful for the price (plus free shipping)! It is a great size with plenty of room for a litter box and toys. I wanted to put it over carpet so I went to home depot and got a sheet of panel that looks like bathtub tile so it is water proof and had them cut it 42""x42"". They were able to give me 2 out of one sheet so I can use one on the floor and if I wanted to I could use one as a cover. It works perfectly for an extra $21. So overall my investment was $54 and I love it! I would highly recommend this.The only one issue I have is that it came with a couple of the rungs broken. I put them back in place and I will contact Amazon to see about getting a replacement.I still am thrilled and so is bunny!"
4,"Pleased, But Not Thrilled","The first week we had the four panel pen, we thought it was a dream come true. It is roomier than we expected and our two puppies loved it. However, after a few days, they learned how to hop over the top. They are very small dogs (a seven-month-old pug and a four-month-old corgi) that are in no way atheletic. When the gate is open to the pen, they go in their willingly to play and sleep. So they enjoy being in their, but not when the gate is shut. We are experimenting with things to cover the top with, like we did with the bottom. IT DOES NOT COME WITH A BOTTOM. It is absolutely great and very cute, but you may find out your dog is much more of an athlete than you thought!"
3,Not for large breeds,"I got this pen for my boxer puppy, thinking it would help contain her during the day while I'm at work, but giving her more room than a crate. She learned to climb over it the second day (10 weeks old). The pen itself is very easy to put together and is pretty solid and heavy enough so she can't lift it. I would recommend this for smaller dogs, but not large breeds, unless there is a secure cover to contain the dog, but I have yet to find one."
3,"Great product, I just had to adjust","Bought the pen and the net. My escape artist puppy climbs right over the pen, chewed through the net on the corners. I am using the pen now as a second level prison in the laundry room. It at least keeps her from the woodwork and the door. I liked that it was adjustable to use as another type of barrier. She is just getting too big too fast. Probably better for smaller dogs that will stay that way."
3,Shih tzu climbed out,"This was a good product that was used the first 2 months after we brought our puppy home. But, after a little effort and exploration, he figured out how to get out. He is now 7 pounds and can get out very easily, so we are past the products's useful life."
1,mini pin climbs it,"After all the postive reviews i decided to purchase this. It is fairly attractive for the money. But it does not work took my 9 pld mini pin about 30 seconds to figure out how to climb and jump out because its to short in height and spaces are way to ""big"" soo it is noooo goood save your money. only one star for it looking pretty and neat."
2,Dogs unlatch door!,"I have a 1 and a half year old pit bull and a 9 month old pit/lab mix, and the little one has figured out how to get the latches open. I have no idea how he does it, but no matter how tight I fasten the screws, he's out in a matter of five minutes. The older of the two can jump out too. I watched her do it this morning. So, they each have their own means of escaping, and I've had to resort back to a traditional metal kennel, though I really enjoyed using this enclosure as their ""bedroom"" for the 4 or 5 months before they figured out the system. I would recommend it to people with smaller dogs who are not jumpers, climbers, or nudgers, as that's how I think he gets the latches open - by ramming his head into the gate until he lifts them out of place with sheer force."
4,Iris CI-604 X Pen,"I ordered two of the Iris Plastic X-pens for 2 French Bulldog puppies. It is one of the best investments that I have made. The X-Pens are easily connected together to make larger pens of any size and/or shape. They are made of lightweight yet sturdy plastic. As long as you train your puppies not to jump on the pens (easily done w/ squirt gun) the pens are more than adequate for containing pets. I purchased oilcloth to put beneath the pens in case of accidents and to prevent any marring to our wood floors. The pens are sturdier when used singularly, but are adequate w/ outside bracing when extending pen. My only complaint is that according to packaging, it can be used outdoors and the connecting rods are supposed to be inserted into the ground. However they are not long enough to do this. I only use the pens indoors so it is not an issue. I purchased metal pens for outdoor use that work great[[ASIN:B000H8YTJI Midwest Black E-Coat Exercise Pen, 24 Inches by 30 Inches]."
4,Plastic Pen Review,I like the comfort and room of this Indoor Pen for my small dog. The product came without the hinges which I was able to obtain from the manufacturer quite easily. I do not like the thumb screw type of opening/closing on the door.
5,A great product.,I was looking for a pen for my Yorkie and her 3 puppies. This is the perfect pen. It's just the right size. It is easy to set up...my 12 year old had it out of the box and set-up in a matter of minutes. I love being able to take one section apart giving you easy access for cleaning inside the pen. I highly recommend this product.
1,I have not received the product,"I commented that we have not received the product, so please ask for more details annexed as date, guide, etc ...and when you want to cancel the purchase tells me already expired date to cancel"
1,Please send my hardware for the gate,you did not send the hardware to attach the gate door to the panel... it is impossible to contact the seller here it is not a good establishment to do business with.
1,very good,Great inside or outside. can be adjusted to fit in many area's. easy to take apart and put together.
4,Great pin for a puppy,"This is a good pin for keeping our puppy out of trouble while she is little and while she is potty training. She's a toy breed, so she's not a big puppy. It's easy to move around, take apart and put back together, it has rods that slide into the corners to hold it together. Only one problem so far is the little caps came off of two of the rods. It still works fine without them, but if they had come off and she had eaten one it wouldn't be good. That's my only reason for 4 stars. It's very sturdy, and easy to clean and care for. It's not so tall that my 7 yr old can't get her in and out, it also has the little door for little kids to care for their puppy without trying to lift them over the top of the gate. I would recommend this for anyone with a small puppy to keep them safe when your not watching them."
5,Dog pen,This is a great product for families initiating puppy crate training or would like to crate small dogs while away. We bought two to create a larger training area for our puppy. The product is very easy to assemble and take apart for area cleaning. The plastic is durable and will hold up to puppy chewing instincts. Multiple panels that lock together allow flexibility of size and shape as the puppy grows.I would highly recommend this product.
2,"OK only for small, immobile pets","My dog is a chihuahua/pomeranian mix - 6 lbs, full grown. She leaps over the wall of this pen as if they weren't there, actually clearing it by a few inches. I gave it to another friend with a smaller, teacup dog. She climbed out with ease. The walls need to be at least a foot and a half higher to be useful. Complete waste of my money."
3,Too Easy For Dog To Get Out,"Although I like the product, and it looks nice, you can't leave your dog in it while your out.1) The pen has 4 walls that act as ladders that a dog can easily climb.So I got the cover add-on...2) The cover add-on is too easy for a dog to either tear through or push through. (I solved this problem by attaching chicken wire across the top. Looked better, provided more light, and my dog cannot chew or push through that)So finally...3) The pen is very light, so light, that my 8lb Chihuahua can pick up a corner with his nose and paws and crawl underneath.Either my dog is Harry Houdini or the pen wasn't meant to keep dogs in."
4,Plastic Pet Pen,"The pen is very good for a puppy...I don't know if it would be good for a large dog ...say 45+ lbs. The only complaint I have is the directions for putting on the door were not clear. I tried putting on the hinges three times...and three different ways, it still dosen't look correct...but the door works fine...so be it.!! Over all it looks nice and it does the job."
4,Pleased with Purchase,"I searched several pet product company sites for the Iris 8-Panel pen and found the lowest price from Amazon, plus FREE shipping! I like that the size of the pen can be adjusted and easily done by just slipping out the connecting pins. The sides are a little wobbly but works fine with our 5 lb. Pom. Plastic is easy to clean and the rubber pads don't scuff our stained concrete floor. I would recommended to others. Quick shipping and in great condition when received."
4,Pet Pen,"This pen is great.Since my dog figured out how to climb out of it the first three days she was home, I went and bought a piece of lattice and had it cut to the size of the top. I used those plastic zip ties and attached it to the top..She didn't get out!! Also, I bought a piece of linoleum flooring to put the pen on top of since I have carpeting. The whole set up really works out great and my dog is safe when I am not around (as well as my carpets!!) Hope this review helps..."
5,dog pen,"excellent pen for 10 pound dog. High enough to keep him from going over the top, sturdy enough for his leaps trying to get out. Door in gate is neccesary, hard to lean over top of pen to reach anything. Stays where you put it indoors, haven't tried it outdoors yet with the stakes in the ground. easy to clean, easy to put together."
2,Needs a cover!!!,"Although the playpen is visually attractive and blends in nicely with a white kitchen, there is one big problem! We have found that this particular pen will not contain our little 2 pound yorkiepoo! She just crawls up and over the side with very little effort! We have tried to cover it with different objects and the little bugger is still able to maneuver her way up and out of this particular pen. Too bad, because it is extremely easy to assemble and super easy to travel with, but if you are looking for a pen to contain your pup, I would suggest looking for one with a cover."
3,Kinda flimsy,It works for what I need it for. Basically I have a huge gorgeous backyard and didn't want my teacup Yorkie to go potty all over it.So if I can't take him for a walk I let him go there. He's only 3 lbs but he can still move it around a bit.
5,Love it,"so easy to use, can make larger or smaller can use 2 section individually can make a long wall if needed pet friendly"
2,Missing Parts,I have ordered this playpen 2 times and both deliveries came with missing parts. There were absolutely no instructions or hardware to assemble the pen door. I attempted to call the manufacturer to obtain the necessary hardware but was never able to reach a person. I left 2 voicemails and have yet to receive a return call. I then returned the item to Amazon and a replacement was sent very quickly. The problem was the 2nd delivery arrived the very same way - no hardware! Amazon is quality checking the items now. I do like the playpen but am very disappointed with the lack of customer service from the manufacturer. Hopefully I'll be able to receive the item with all necessary parts to assemble it.
5,Very versatile.,"Love this pen, we move it all over our house very easy to reconfigure to what you need it. Just wish it was a little taller, our pup is a jumper and she can almost reach to top. But she can't climb on this pen, which is a good thing, we had one of those wooden baby gates and she just climbed right over it."
5,For A rabbit,Bought the 4 panel for a rabbit and is great. Very easy to put together and is big enough to where im comfortable the rabbit has enough room while he is in there.
2,Too Small,Purchased this with hopes that my peagle would get use to it and I could use this for her while I was working. It is way too small for her to use as any kind of play area. She is a vert small dog and when her food and small bed mat are in it she has barely any room. We use this more apart to block off rooms then we use it together.At least it saved us money on buying a lot of gates....
2,Well built but one major problem,"It's built we'll, but one major flaw....the hinges are fluid. So a dog can push the crate and change the shape of it. It would be great if the hinges locked in place"
4,A very good introduction to Calder's art,I bought this book after my visit to the Calder exhibition in the National Gallery of Art in Washington in May '98. It is really a very nice book. You will discover in the book that some of the masterpieces (Spring or Romulus and Remus) seen in the exhibition were found left in Calder's studio and rearranged by the artist. You will love and enjoy this book !
1,Let's Give it a Star and a half...,"You'd think that with no acting ability or training, the cast would at least have the common decency to memorize their lines. But noooo. The extra half star is for the college effort at some respectable grindhouse violence, but this dog's merits end there. The narrative is non-sensical, the performances embarrassing and the production values below the level of what most reasonably intelligent people could accomplish with a consumer grade video camera and a free weekend. Way below. I would even suggest that this was shot without the assistance of any lighting equipment. If it's an exploitative revenge yarn you're in the mood for, try LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE before wasting your hard-earned $3 on RAVAGE."
5,"A beautiful, fascinating, thrilling book","I loved this book! Every Jewish woman (and man) and everyone interested in Jewish life in America should read it. It gives a view of American and Jewish history I had never seen before, and it is beautifully written. It is full of moving stories of real women working to build America at every period of history. I had never understood how important women have been in creating the American Jewish community. Just wonderful!"
5,"Subtle flavor, no pink colored liquid, a nice aroma","I am very choosy with picking green teas. I have tried a few before I came across Lipton's Green Tea. I always felt that Lipton makes tea more along the lines of ""mass production"" and misses on the exclusivity. But this tea beats my expectations. It has a nice flavor - very subtle - no coloration to turn the tea into a PINK liquid, a nice flavor and very light aroma. Really like it - This is going to turn into my favorite.the only downside, if you like variety and happen to buy this pack alone- then you are stuck with 120 berry flavored green teas :) But of course this is not even a negative :)Enjoy!"
5,Saves time and money,"I drink a lot of green tea, and because my favorite is only available 20 in a box, I was constantly running to the grocery. Buying the 120 count box saves me time, and the price can't be beat. If you use Lipton green tea and want to save and money, order from Amazon."
3,Personally prefer a stronger berry taste,"I wasn't able to find this product at any grocery stores near me, so I took a chance and ordered a few boxes from amazon. I drink this tea everyday, and I like it, but it's just not strong enough for my taste. One bag for one cup seems a little more weak than other green teas I've tried, and I don't like having to use two bags per cup as it doubles the cost per cup. It doesn't have a very strong mixed berry taste. I prefer the Lipton Superfruit Acai Blueberry and Yogi Blueberry green teas over this one. I'm still looking for a good mixed berry flavored green tea with a little bit stronger taste than this. If you prefer a more mild tea with only a slight berry flavor, this would be for you."
3,Not very dependable,"These bags aren't very good at all. About 25% of the bags fail to seal properly even after you've zipped them properly. Definitely do not use these for liquid storage or air-tight containment. We bought these because of the price and instantly regretted it! I'm sure they're fine for light storage and easy enough to open and close. However, when the plastic zips don't stay attached to the zipline and/or the seal does not stay shut after you've closed it, you end up actually spending more money/box because the amount you waste actually makes these more expensive! I'll go back to the old tried and true brand thank you very much!"
4,The Honey,This was a some what easy build and was fun to paint in the North Africa campaign colors. cool little horse too. the figures look like they are striking a model's pose so I had to cut their arms and re-adjust them to look normal.
2,Does not always operate properly,"We gave this book to our 18 month old who loves Elmo, and he enjoys the pictures and music..when it works. The button on ours has to be pressed very hard, and sometimes hit repeatedly before it will play. This is very frustrating for our son and rather than soothing him, it often upsets him. We tried changing the batteries, but it continues to do the same thing. Maybe ours is defective???"
5,A wonderful adventure awaits.,"What a wonderfully written story! I'm a long time fan of Terry Pratchett and have read many of his Disc World Series. ""Diggers"" is another delightful contribution from Mr. Pratchett. I recommend this whole 3 book series (Truckers, Diggers & Wings) for all ages!"
4,Diggers is good choice for encouraging younger readers,"Diggers is told in Terry Pratchett's usual page turning fun. The characters are interesting and the reader fInds him, or herself imagining what it would be like to be three inches tall and having one adventure after another alongside the Nome's. The most simple day to day occurrence that we take for granted is an awesome task for Masklin and his crew."
3,Give it a read.,"The book was an etertaining, easy read. Not my favorite Pratchett book, but worth a read! A good vacation or before bed book."
4,ISAAC,"I hope this is the album/CD that I heard before. I can't be sure, because I didn't get to review the album/CD audible."

5,Enjoying Intimacy with God,I heard Dr Sanders preach when he was about 84 years old. It was amazing. It was the most powerful sermon that I have ever heard. It was this experience that prompted me to buy and read this book. The book is wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about knowing God at a deeper level. I am reading the book slowly and savoring the knowledge that is coming from the Word and from Dr Sanders own walk with Him.
4,A fine introduction to Lara Fabian's French material,"Carpe diem was Lara Fabian's second album, originally released in 1994. It presents a well-crafted and varied selection of her French material ranging from typically dramatic French ballads, such as 'Je suis malade' and the single 'Si tu m'aimes', to the lively gospel sound of 'Saisir le jour'. Highlights include the smooth and romantic opener 'Puisque c'est l'amour', as well as the light and catchy 'Leila' and 'Au loin là-bas'. The album features one song in English, 'Bridge of Hope', the closing track. Carpe diem provides a good introduction to the talents of Lara Fabian and is a must for any Lara Fabian collection."
1,yuk!!,"i have been looking for another album by lara fabian and chose this one based on the star ratings and the fact that she sings in french. loud vocals, loud music, boring songs...no soul. and i cannot believe i paid so much for it."
3,"Not that bad, but not that great, either.","This book will hold your attention to a point, but it has a severe lack in originality in my opinion. That, and I think too much was happening in one book. Kinda cheesy, too. I think Mage or Vampire: The Masquerade fans would like it better. What I did like about it, though, was that it has alot of charecter."
5,Excellant Book,Granddaughter loved the book. Will read it myself. Perfect reading material for children.
2,Owls in the Family,Owls in the Family Book Review By ElizabethI give Owls in the Fmily two stars because the story was good but had a sad ending.I thought the author could write more about Billy coming back someday and finding the owls again.I recommend this story to anyone who likes the outdoor world and animals.
3,Owls in the Family,"This is a great book.It has humor and adventure.It is one of my favorite books.You learn about owls and how to raise them.A few of the characters are Billy,Wol,and Weeps."
3,Owls in the Family,The book was ok. It was about owls. I enjoyed reading some parts and some were just ok. I liked the part about the eggs breaking in the kids mouth. I learned a lot.THE END
2,Owls In The Family,Owls In The Family was okay; I would recommend it to a younger age group like 3rd or 4th grade. It gave me a lot of owl info - but I wouldn't read it again!
1,Books--disappointing order :(,"I needed FIVE, and all I got were TWO. That doesn't work for my classroom What happened to my other books????"
3,Owls in the Faimily,I think Owls in the Family was an exciting book. It wasnt the best. But it was good.
4,"A hilarious, action-packed book!","Owls in the Family is about a kid who got two owls. He named them Wol and Weeps. Wol causes lots of problems. For example, he plays tricks on Mutt, the dog. This is a funny book full of action. by The Picky Pickles Reading Group"
2,Owls in the Family,"I thought Owls In The Family was an ok book.It is very sad though.It was funny at some points, and sad at some points.I recomend it for people who do not love cats a lot, because an owl kills a cat."
5,Great funny book,Owls in the Family is wonderfully funny nonfiction book about A boy and his two owls. Many times I laughed out loud. A wonderful read !
5,Owls Review,"In Owls in the Family there was a nine year old kid named Billy. Billy found two owls at diffrent times. First he found Wol the owl, then he found Weeps the owl. Billy Found Wol after Wol fell out of the nest."
5,Most comfortable socks I've ever worn!,"I bought both Thorlo socks and Fox River socks and Fox River definitely is the winner. Comfortable, no slippage, and wearing them makes my long walks so much more enjoyable. Lots of foot protection but still breathable for keeping your feet cool. Just ordered 4 more pair of these great socks. You'll be hooked once you try them."
3,So not worth the Price,"I have to say there is nothing wrong with this pair of socks. They are comfortable enough, although nothing special. I just cannot believe 1 pair of socks cost so much. I would understand the cost if they were A LOT more than they are. I blame myself for not realizing I was paying for 1 pair of socks. Live and Learn."
3,Advanced High School Level Textbook,"This book is written as a school text book, probably targetting high school through sophomore level college students. There are some interesting pieces of the book about the history of games and analysis of games like backgammon and poker. Other games such as bridge and state lotteries are discussed. The treatment of game theory was new to me, but a lot of the content of this book is basic probability & statistics."
4,A Good Book.,"I always enjoy reading books on the venture industry written by professionals with practical expereince because the others are usually do not add much insight. However, not all industry experts write insightful books, but this is an exception. However, the price is a bit steep for less than 400 pages.I would have given this book the highest rating but ""The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs"" is the best book in my opinion. It is not only for entrepreneurs but VCs and anyone else who wants to gain an in-depth understanding of te venture capital industry and process. It may even be too advanced for some entrepreneurs but if you want to understand and do it right, look no further! Be warned: its 600 pagesThese two books would go great together because they are both advanced and very insightful, unlike most of the other books on the subject."
1,Hopelessly Outdated,"Bought this book on the strength of other titles in the Culture Shock series. Was disappointed with its boilerplate descriptions of the process of culture shock and culture-by-culture descriptions of major holidays. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is little discussion of the realities of modern Singapore nor the aspects of which will most likely cause cultural misgivings (ki'asu culture, pursuit othe 5Cs, difficulties in making local friends, government policies towards the media, arts and alternative lifestlyes, etc.). Furthermore, few practitical strategies for dealing with life in Singapore are introduced (building a network of friends, taking advantage of extensive opportunities for personal and professional development, developing a love of sports, using Singapore as a hub for exploring the region, etc.)"
2,A Very Limited View,"I read this book on my one-way flight to Singapore 4 years ago, and took it as dogma... unfortunately, it was a highly oversimplified and utterly narrow view of a very modern, unique society. I lived, worked and taught college there for three years, and later realized it was a bad idea to rely on an American expat wife for insightful cultural and business advice!"
1,Pretty bad,"I bought this book after reading and appreciating other books in the series. But this book is trying to be everything but doesn't cover the main theme - understanding the local culture. It goes into practical details although there are other much better sources for it, it covers sights and tourist spots but not as well as the normal travel guides. But when it comes to actually understanding the psyche of the Singaporean, this book is hopeless with a lot of silly generalizations and very superficial statements and none of the very helpful insights I have learnt to expect from the Culture Shock series. It's like the author has just summarized a bunch of guidebooks and added a large dose of Singapore propaganda..."
1,"Selena shines, but this video is amateur at best...","Having read some of the negative reviews of this video, I still wanted to check it out to see some of the local footage, not being from the Texas area. There were some interesting clips, but overall it is terrible. The quality of the tape was awful, the sound was extremely poor, barely audible at times. Much of the video is blurred, and a good part of it is just still pictures, many not even in focus. You do not even have the pleasure of listening to her music in the background, assumedly because it is unauthorized. Selena was a great entertainer and an even better person. This video does her no justice; it looks as though it was made in someone's garage. Go with 'Selena Remembered' instead. It's authorized by her family and is a thousand times better all around."
1,Injustice,"This video is a total waste of time for any Selena fan. I was disgusted after watching it, it's low budget, there's NONE of her music or videos, instead it's the same scenes over and over again in front of her old house and around her gravesite with interviews from fans. And it looks like it was done on someone's home computer. DON'T waste your money or your time!"
1,Brazilian Selena fan ! i've seen better ones!,"I love Selena. I live in Rio de Janeiro and i heard about her story when i saw the movie ""Selena', after that i got so interessed on her life and music that i can't imagine the world without her songs. i bought ""The final notes"" and ""Selena remembered"" and let me tell ya, the remembered one is a lot better than the final notes one. This video is poorly produced and the clips of her aren't the best I've ever seen. They never let the clips of her singing play live, instead they talk over them and mostly show pictures of her. Well, if anyone here has materials or just want to chat about Selena with me fell free to write: Bye!"
1,I love Selena but this movie was pretty bad,"I love Selena and I am a big fan of hers but I have to say, this movie didn't explain her life at all. All they really did was show pictures and clips of her which were blurry and just talk. That's all that happened, the host talked. He didn't explain her life very well- there was more to it than just singing. Also, you don't get to hear her sing at all. Just blurry clips. And they spent more time on the messages the fans wrote after her tragic death than anything. The second part just explains about other singers, not Selena. This was very poor and I think they could have done a better job. The movie with Jennifer Lopez explains it all much better. No wonder it's so cheep!"
2,Buy Selena Remembered Instead!,"I love everything about Selena as much as the next person and I bought this video because of that. This video is poorly produced and the clips of her aren't the best I've ever seen. They never let the clips of her singing play live, instead they talk over them and mostly show pictures of her. I could see that on the internet for free! They only good thing (aside from Selena) is that it shows a lot of her house after her death. Otherwise, this video could have been much much better. They only reason it's selling is because it's her, not because the quality is good. Buy Selena Remembered instead, it is much more orgainzed, the quality is excellent, and you get to actually see and hear Selena sing."
5,I think the movie was great.,Selena was the kind of person everyone want to be like. Selena was the kind of person that everyone would like to get to know. I think the movie was great. It showed everyone what Selena was really like. I just wish that she was still alive. I'm really sorry that she died.
5,EXCELLENT,So much packed into a such a little book (just over 200 pages). No loose ends and a new twist with each page turned. I loved this story. This is a great first novel! We'll hear from Ms. McNeal in the future in a big way I'm sure.
3,Johnnie Allan review of book,"Helen, I had no idea your life was such a struggle. I commend you for putting it in writing; it took much courage to do this. Exposing what's on one's mind if often good for the soul. I can detect that it was for you."
2,"Small set, not worth $44 unless you're a collector","My son ordered this set with a gift card thinking that because of the price it was a large set. It is only about 100 pieces. It was originally sold in 2005 for only $9.99 so keep that in mind. If you're a collector, it is a great set but if you're ordering it for a child to play with, prepare for tears and disappointment when they see how small it is.I personally think the number of pieces and rarity of the set should have been made VERY clear in the description. Every Lego box has the number or pieces on the front of the box and you can see in this picture it is not there. If it had been, we would have realized that it is nowhere near a big as the box and price makes it out to be."
2,Oversimplified,"The author has simplified drawing the human figure by eliminating real anatomy. While perhaps this might suit beginners or children, I believe too much is left out to be helpful to the serious artist. For example there is almost nothing on musculature. The drawings are quite crude. The author claims that he makes the body mechanics ""simple and sensible"". It would be nice if body mechanics were that simple, but unfortunately they are not. In my opinion there are many very good books written for artists on this subject. This doesn't happen to be one of them."
5,A nostalgic look at our past,"I was born during the depression, and though I don't have direct personal memories of soup lines....great migrations, etc., I was touched by it, through my parents.I see my parents in this book, and with but a little imagination, I can see myself. Lee Parmeter has not only written a very good read, he has done a great service. He has given the young people of today, a very vivid, real, and poignant look at the world of their grandparents.Bravo, Parmeter.....a job very well done.Robert Vaughan"
1,Waste,I bought 3 bags of these treats and they didnt work at all!!! My dog loved them as treats but they did not make a difference with my dogs urine burning the grass. I would not buy again!
4,Flash Back Tire Dressing,"This stuff makes your tires look quite impressive. It does not last for weeks, however, as the bottle indicates. It lasts a couple of days. The applicator is helpful, but I had to get a cloth to apply the stuff to the entire surface of my tires. I have an '85 Trans Am so the wheel well is rather tight. It is good stuff, but it doesn't last for very long."
3,You CAN use these items in the microwave...,"UPDATE: DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO MY ORIGINAL POST. I'VE BEEN USING THE MUGS, PLATES AND BOWLS IN THE MICROWAVE FOR MANY MONTHS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS AND NO CRAZING. I'D CHANGE MY RATING TO 5 STARS IF I COULD, BUT THE EDITING FEATURE DOESN'T ALLOW IT."
5,Just what I was looking for,I hate huge coffee mugs that make your beverage cold before you can drink it and require a lot of effort to lift. These are very nice because they are a good size and shape and come in fun colors. They are also the type that don't chip easily.
2,chips easily,"I bought these mugs because the reviews indicated that they were sturdy and chip resistant. That is not the case. I broke a handle off on my first use. Within a week, I saw a chip on another. It was a small chip and I was able to put some fingernail polish on to hide the chip. I consider myself a careful person, but the slighest ding and a chip occurs.I can't reccomend them to anyone unless they are used for display only. The color and style is beautiful but everyday use is not for these mugs."
1,Leaves coffee ring,"I loved the look of these, but it appears that the unglazed ring on the bottom of the cup allows the coffee to soak through leaving a ring on the table. I am disappointed in them and have returned them. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy, as if I had to pay to return, I would have kept them for emergency or for outdoor use only, instead I get to order another set and hope for the best."
1,not what i ordered,"the item i ordered look like this, but what i got was some plastic piece which looked nothing like this. i could tell it was poorly made, and i wasn't too keen on putting that piece of plastic near my fuel lines. DO NOT PURCHASE"
2,Good Introduction but poor quality,"This is a good introduction to Tchaikovsky for the beginner that gives a broad sampling of his work. Considering the price, it's a good value if someone is just wanting to begin exploring classical music or Tchaikovsky in particular.However, the sound quality on this albumn is quite poor and there are much higher quality Tchaikovsky recordings available."
1,Pretty rough.,"The Hungarian Dance is seriously clipped and nearly unplayable.The Dance of the Swans finishes distorted. It made me wince.Maybe this would be a good recording to play at a flea market, a baseball game or a NASCAR race, but I threw it in the trash.Disappointing."
1,great music poorely performed.,T. is my favourite composer but the interpretation on this CD is rather like a good effort in high shool
4,Favorite classical,"He is one of my favorite classical composers. This cd contains some of his best and well-known works. While not every selction is a favorite, there are more than enough to make getting the cd worthwhile"
