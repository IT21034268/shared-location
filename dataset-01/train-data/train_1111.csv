1,It did not work for long,"I bought this product and put it outside and at first I thought it was working fine, for the first month I did not see any cats. Then I noticed the light was not coming on when I passed by. Then I noticed the cats returning. Changed the battery, still did not work. I got onto Amazon and realized that I had passed the point of return policy--so I had to pay the shipping and would only get a 'partial refund'. That stinks, I figure if I pay 50 bucks for something it should give me more than a month of service.I think it worked, when it came on, but now I don't know cause it doesn't come on anymore. And the cats are back, pooping in my vegetable garden. NEVER AGAIN..."
1,View from the window,"I was pretty hopeful about this solution to the local neighborhood cats using my city backyard as a large kitty litter box. I bought two units, one for a neighbor friend.A couple of days after positioning the Cat Deterrent in my backyard, I got it see it in action, or lack of action. I was looking out my home office window when I saw a cat entering my backyard. I was curious how it would react. It walked casually up to a bush 4 feet from the new unit and urinated all over the bush. When finished, it slowly walked away, directly in front of unit a second time. This time the cat turned its head toward the unit as it walked by.So much for a solution to my problem. If I had more time in the day, I would return the item."
3,Works Pretty Well,"I've owned this for about 4 months now and find that it does a pretty good job to ward away the neighbor's cats from returning to pee on the same spot on my lawn. Downsides with this unit is that unless one buys the AC adapter the battery life can be limiting as it is not only triggered on by animals, but also by movement of nearby leaves/branches waving in the breeze as well as by water from the sprinkler system. I estimate the battery to last only several days if covering a lawn area that is set automatically to water by sprinkler to a few weeks in an area with less frequent motion. I think it would probably work best with the AC adapter if a cord is possible to use."
1,Disappointed,My dad has a huge issue with cats in his yard I bought him this product to try. He put it out in the yard and the cat came and practically layed on it.
3,Contech CatStop Ultrasonic Outdoor Cat Deterrent,Replace batteries often. You need a lot of them to be effective. One or two won't Very disappointed in quality of item.
1,It did not work for me,"I bought this device to scare away stray cats off of my front porch. I set it up per instructions. However, I saw the cats seating in front of it. It didn't scare the cat away even though it claims that it would."
1,completely ineffective,"I bought 3 of these to keep cats out of my garden, and they completely ignore the devices. This morning, I found a cat taking a dump about 3 feet in front of one of them. I tried to contact the manufacturer, and got an answering machine saying that they would be closed on January first for New Year's day. I was calling in April... Do not waste your money."
1,JUNK! DOSEN'T WORK!,"I watched cats walk back and forth in front it, one even sat down and watch the red light go on and off! SAVE your money, DON'T buy this rip-off."
3,"Works, but cats are smart",This item will work for cats. However they will eventually find ways around it. So don't be suprise if they show up again.
1,Useless,Do not buy this. It does absolutely nothing. I set it up outside and proceeded to watch the cats walk right up to it and smell it. Junk!!
1,Product did not work,"I set this product up and the neighbor cats that are used to defecating in our yard were not bothered in the least. There are 6 cats and I saw at least 4 of them nearby it, jumping over it, defecating right near it.When i called to get a refund, seller would honor that, but would not cover shipping costs."
2,"Wished it worked for me, but didn't :(","I live in an apartment complex and the neighorhood strays seem to think that my patio is their personal litter box. I set this up for over a week. At first, it seemed to be working because I wasn't finding any evidence that the cats had been around, but we had lots of rain that week. Then there it was...a nice little present right in the path of the Catstop. Remaining hopeful, I moved the Catstop to be in direct line with the area they frequented the most. The next day right in front of the Catstop was another ""package"". I know the unit was working because when I would walk by it, I set it off. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to scare the cats away as claimed.I really had hoped it worked as other reviewers seem to have had good results. But for me, it was an expensive failure."
2,Disappointing COOP CUP!!!!,"Purchased two of these Coop Cups to attach to metal cage for my kittens. When they arrived, they were all dented, clasps were extremely sharp, hard to attach, they would not stay even so there was no way I could have put water in the one. Very disappointed in this product. Price wasn't bad, if product would have been made better. I did return them."
4,Great Book!,This book really helped my children with their geographic skills! I would reccomend this book to any family with children!
1,don't buy this item.,"i received this item aproximetly 20 days ago and until 2 days ago i don't have a chance to try it.When i go to LA,I tried it but it was broken because it's wires are so thin.I couldn't use it."
3,Sansa Auto Charger,"Somewhat flimsy relative to other car chargers; feels cheap, but functional. I would expect this to crack/break if one is not careful."
3,Sansa View Car Charger,"Great for charging my Sansa View on the road. I leave my Sansa View in the car and mostly use it at work, I use car charger instead of bringing it home to charge."
2,"Virtually Unedited, Low-Quality Footage","I loved In the Shadow of the Moon and When We Left Earth, and Apollo 13 (both the movie and the documentary), so it's not the subject matter that's the problem for me, but it's like they just threw all the footage (most of it grainy, low-res footage at that) they had on this thing without any editing whatsoever. Literally every moment of the countdown, launch, spacewalk, etc. They could have cut out so much where nothing is happening and just kept the more exciting stuff. About as exciting as watching ice melt. It does come in a nice stamped metal box though. At least mine did."
2,Auger Length Not to Size!!,"The ShelterLogic Auger Anchor Model 10079 is supposed to include eight auger anchors that are 30"" long. However when I opened the box, the auger anchors were only 26"" long . . . when measured from the tip of the rod to the end of the ""eye"" loop. I contacted Northern Tools & Equipment, who had shipped me the product, and asked them to check their remaining stock of Model 10079 to see if they could find any with 30"" length. They indicated that all Model 10079 auger anchors they had in stock were 26"" . . . and not 30"" as indicated on the box. Since the product was not to the ShelterLogic specification, I returned the product to Northern Tools & Equipment and I received a full refund . . . including shipping. This product was manufactured in China and apparently ShelterLogic has no formal quality control program to inspect incoming products manufactured in China. What a shame!! Other than being 4"" short, the product appears to be well made."
5,I Love This Book: Lots and Lots and Lots,"My son and I love this child's book. It's rare to find one so cheery and clever that young and old ( well, older) can enjoy equally. This is one of those perfect kids' reads for that reason. I don't tire of reading it and my son actually gets a kick out of the fun places one can be kissed. (Might I add it's also hard to read about kissing to a boy sans 'yuck' factor.)"
5,A spanish fan from pandora j128446303@abonados.cplus.es,"Pandora is alive. Mayte, Isabel and Fernanda are in armony with the music. Thanks for be alive. I hope you'll hear this CD."
2,Wrong glasses sent,"The glasses in the picture are not the pharmium glasses I found out.The glasses I received are still good and I do like them so I decided to keep them, however they are NOT the glasses pictured.So, be careful, if these are exactly what you want then look elsewhere.The glasses pictured are about $120 bucks, not the $89.99 quoted."
5,Love!,I was diagnosed with a herniated disk in my back in May ad i was in extreme amounts of pain. i had a very hard time sleeping in general until i received this product. it is absolutely amazing as it removes the pain /strain on my back by putting the knees up in an elevated position. This pillow will defintely be a staple in my household for years to come. I plan to order at least 3 backup pillows just to ensure future comfort! Much cheaper than pain meds and doctors appointments!
3,good support for tall people,"i am 5' 4"" and this is too tall for me. I cannot use it for more than half hour or my neck starts hurting. it is compact and fits well on my side of the bed."
4,Lovers Island,"Lovers Island is a bit slow, however, an excellent listening product. Kenny's voice is immaculate as always."
1,Not a regular DVD you can watch,"I have a MAC OS version 10.5.8 and this DVD doesn't work on it. Apparently, you have to install from the CD a software that gives you an interface from which you can choose which movie tutorial you want to play. I could not install this by clicking on the install icon. When I tried to get a movie file from the contents, it asked me for a serial number which is provided inside the DVD case. It tells me that the number is incorrect when I typed it in. Frustrating..."
5,Incredible!,"This book is a treasure. We are given an incredible accounting of Vietnam before, during, and after the war--an accounting I have not found in other books. Ms. Bong-Wright's story is itself noteworthy. She is a triumphant lady, who is dedicated to bringing justice and grace to the world. Her activism and diplomacy have made permanent marks in post-war Vietnam and countries throughout the world. We are lucky to have such an individual among us.The book itself is well-written and will keep you engaged to the end. She writes honestly and openly about the events of her life and is able to apply an elegent tone to the harshest events in her past. There are life-lessons in this book that we should all take to heart."
4,I wish I had read it before,"&#65279; I wish I had been able to read this book before I went to Vietnam in 1963, serving theremost of the years until the end in 1975. Using the story of her family, Ms Bong-Wright bringshome the extent to which this really was a civil war, dividing families permanently and creating aset of circumstances that made the war unwinnable for us Americans, particularly when we didnot understand the strengths of the other side. It also communicates a strong sense of what it waslike to live there under French rule before and during WWII and of the deep ties that bindVietnamese families."
1,Strange Taste,"I've eaten Mapo tofu in China and the US. This sauce is nothing like I've ever tasted, in the worst way possible."
1,The Worst,"Don't know where to start about how bad this sauce was. It has an off-taste, but the worst was the amount of salt. Almost 1,000mg in a 4oz package! I don't even know how they can get it so salty. I took one bite and it kind of burned my mouth with the same aftertaste when you gargle salt-water. The House brand is infinitely better, I just thought I'd try a change."
1,Game Freezes on Leopard,"The Mac version seems to freeze constantly at some point during the game. Game is a thriller, but if you can't play it, what is the point."
2,Poor recording quality,"Even considering the low price, you should think twice before ordering this CD. The sound is muddy throughout, and distorted during the louder passages. There is no indication when this live recording was made, but it is well below the quality we've now come to expect."
2,What was this recorded with?,"It sounds like it was recorded with a cheap hand-held cassette recorder with the batteries running down! There are sneezes and coughs and it was mastered at the wrong speed! If you MUST have this, I suggest ripping it to your hard drive and then running software such as Adobe Audition. Remove the noise, add some extra equalization, and transpose the entire thing up by 2-4 semitones depending on the piece, in resample mode, so that the length of each passage is shortened by the same amount that the pitch goes up. It should sound like boys and men singing, not demons and post-menopausal women with sore throats. It almost sounds halfway decent then."
1,This would be good if you could hear it,This is such a bad recording. I was so excited to hear this but i't very hard to hear it. I'm sure it would be beautiful but I can't stand to listen to a whole song. It's a shame to say but I wouldn't buy this album.
3,"great music, bad recording","Des Pres's ""Ave Maria"" is one of my favorite songs of all time, but it is woefully rendered here compared to Chanticleer or even Boston Camerata. This CD is low quality, but all the Sistine Choir CDs I have sound similar. Watch the Midnight Mass from the Vatican even now; the sound is poor. Remember, this is liturgical, which demands different standards. If you are interested in Latin ecclesiastical polyphony, or if you don't have other recordings of these songs and may sing them, I'd recommend it regardless. I got it for 99 cents at FYE, so I'm not complaining."
4,Great for Beginners,"This book is a great little book to start with. Ms. Woods gives basic information for people who have never read music or need a refresher. The songs that she used are songs that are familiar to most of us and makes the learning process a little easier. Concise, to the point, and a great value for the money."
5,Great book!,I'm a total beginner at the harp and this book made sense to me! I could already read music (slowly) but this book starts at the beginning and explains things clearly. It's great!
3,"Not bad if you have no teacher, but a little amateurish for me","I bought this book when I bought my first harp and used it very little. I started taking lessons almost immediately, and found that it was a poor substitute (and in fact even a poor supplement) for having a harp instructor. It's very unprofessional in appearance, with the copy looking as though it was typed on an old-fashioned, manual typewriter. The notation is good and the fingering helpful, however.This book is good, I feel, for someone looking to just 'fool around' with the harp as it focuses far less on technique and jumps right into playing simple songs.If you have the benefit of having an instructor and plan on being half-way serious, I'd recommend passing this book up for something like 'Metodo per Arpa,' by Grossi, which I find far superior."
1,Should have been 12.1 not 12.1D,Search as for a single voice coil. Came up as 121 not 12.1dExtremely disappointed when I received the wrong / productlisted below.
4,Full Vista - excellent value,"Installed this as a second OS on a MacBook Pro - runs perfectly. Everyone likes to knock Vista - but, bottom line, given a well equipped machine - Vista is way ahead of XP. As a developer, there are things I just couldn't do under older OS's. This package with the Ultimate version is excellent value."
2,Disappointing...,"As a windows fan, all my hyped feelings were gone after 10-day test drive of this ultimate edition. My current system is P4 3.2GB, 3GB DDR, ATI All-in-Wonder X800, and Creative Audigy 2 Plantium.1. CPU usage is up to 90% using Aero glass and IE7 opening at the same time, despite 3GB of memory in the system.2. ATI driver isn't fully compatible yet, the screen sometimes looks horrible after the system waking up from the sleep mode.3. Music plays are constantly paused due to the high CPU usage & beta sound card driver.4. Receiving Blue Screen twice with no solution found.5. Horrible unicode reading from Windows Media Player 11."
1,Don't buy it,I bought the windows vista upgrade version. Save yourself the trouble and don't upgrade. The software created tons of problems and is no good in fixing them. Wait for the non beta version.
5,Excellent Book!,"I have got every one of the books by Dr. Schwarz, and I have to say every one of them is great. He explained the Chemistry of Food and Life in a fun way that most people can understand.One thing I would like is, may be in the future the books can include the chemical structures of the compounds discussed, perhaps at the end of the book? I know not everyone will be interested in this, but I certainly like to know more about them. A list of structures of the compounds discussed in the previous books will also be most welcome to me."
3,You are what you eat,This is an easy read that discusses food chemistry and health. Has many interesting stories and dispels many folk legends while supporting others.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this video planning to use it with a population of teens who are emotionally and behaviorally disturbed. I previewed it with a team of therapists all of whom agreed that the film is amateurish, the plot is not believable, and that it would not be useful for the teens in our program."
5,A must have for any Blondie fan...,"Great information, great pictures, very interesting reading. I am so glad this band has endured. They have earned it. Keep on going!"
4,"Good, But Some Disappointments","I am a huge Blondie fan. Always have been. The book is mainly told from Debbie Harry's point of view, and frequently she refers to Blondie as herself, not the group.The cover could have been a lot better. It should have included the entire group. The picture of Debbie is less than flattering. The pictures inside the book are great, as well as Debbie's life before she became ""famous."" It would have been nice to have included the album covers with each chapter heading.The narrative became a little monotonous with the group's trial and tribulations of ""making it.""All in all, I recommend the book but caution the reader there are some limitations."
5,amazing!,Chris Stein is an amazing photographer. I can look at these the rest if my life and not get bored.
4,Great Shoe,"Got this shoe about a year ago. Its true to size and fits perfectly. The image display is exactly what the shoe looks like, no surprises at all. It feels great on my feet and for a pair of heels, comfortable."
1,You get what you paid for,I find this shoes to be very uncomfortable but then again I paid less than $30 for the pair so I cant complaint.
1,Triple check to make sure,"Don't listen to the Amazon make sure it fits dropdown. It isn't acurate. I purchased the part and it didn't fit although Amazon claimed it would. The part itself is fine. Seems like it would be a good product. I actually double checked this part against an online auto part supplier. They agreed with Amazon. Unfortunately they are both wrong and I'm out $23 bucks. Perhaps its Mr. Gasket making the false claim, I don't know. Plus, I'm back to search for a replacement part for my car. Waste of time thanks to someone else's error."
5,a nice sort of strange...,"Kinda reminds me of Frank Zappa, you have to wade through some mighty weird stuff but ssooo worth it to find some incredably great things. I got turned on to col.Bruce Hampton by his involvment with the Codetalkersthey be a nice hippy band well worthy of checking out--check out ""NOW"""
2,Horrible Customer Service,"the product came much earlier then expected however thats the only good part. I bought the product because i own the same kind from years earlier apparently they cheaped out, The original is very thick,has white lines running through it and is very glossy. This is extremely thin, no white lines and very dull. I tried to return the product because it is not the same as adervtized and never heard back from the seller i would not recomend them just because of thier poor customer service."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED!!,"This product is described as black. IT IS NOT! It is black with grey markings (a la faux marble). It could not use it for the purposes for which I bought it. A total waste of money. The product may be okay, but it is not what it isw advertised to be!"
3,ehh,"It's good quality paper but looks cheap. I need to use several pieces to cover the kitchen counter, which would be fine with a different paper but with this one, because of the ""marble"", you can't match it up and make it look uniform. Would be better is longer than 18 inches but what can ya do? Hopefully I will find something to do with it."
4,contact paper,The product was actually better than I expected. It worked perfectly for the use that I had in mind. I was also happy with the color.
3,Too much random noise,"At least with Coming Up, the songs had some sense of melody. This new effort just doesn't work."
3,Hits and Misses,"Whew! Talk about hit and miss...Suede serve up ""Coming Up"" - part II. Filled with plastic wrapped tunes smacking with lipgloss. Sure, they're pretty catchy, and they make your toes tap, but in four months - will you be listening to this album? Probably not.How many times can Brett Anderson write a song about living on the edge of London's club scene? It got boring the 5th time around. Don't believe me? Just listen to ""Savoir Fare"" and ""She's in Fashion"" - wake me when it's over.I haven't given up on Suede - I'm just waiting for the introspection that I know they're capable of. With or without Mr. Butler. Perhaps the next disc?"
2,"Whatever good they did, they did it long ago.","I love the older Suede albums, like ""Suede"" and ""Coming Up"", ""Head Music"" is not up to par. The songs have none of the energy of the older Suede albums, while the musicians seem to play in their sleep.Suede seems to be playing along with the ""Britpop is Dead"" idea, unfortunatly, their talent seems to have gone to the grave with it. It is noisy, long, and very insubstantial.A crushing disappointment."
1,"sadly, suede died with this album","i'm so sad... ""elephant man"" made me cringe... and the line ""give me head, give me head, give me head music instead"" ??? they arent serious are they?suppose bernard coming back is out of the question, I still have the previous albums, get dog man star or sci-fi please.... this album is a sad shell of a once great band."
2,Mediocre Without Bernard,"Whatever attracted me to Suede's debut album and its brilliant followup, ""Dog Man Star"", is conspicuously absent in ""Head Music"", which strikes me as shallow electronica. Even ""Coming Up"" still retained some of the inspiration of its predecessors, thought it was completed by Bernard's replacement.Suede was my all-time favorite band. I stopped listening after this one."
4,Get zapped. Buy this CD.,"I have recently discovered The London Suede, and have quickly snatched up their entire body of work. Head Music has got much of the old swagger we love from TLS, but it also has some new guitar effects and pulsing rhythms. And of course, melodies that get you humming along pretty quickly.Pure pop, but extremely interesting pop you should try out."
4,Another solid effort,"Though this album lacks the emotional staying power of ""Coming Up"" (or even ""Dog Man Star""), it has more than its share of great moments. ""Electricity"" was a great first single, ""Everything Will Flow"" features a gorgeous melody, and ""Asbestos"" is, by far, the coolest song you're likely to hear in this, the year of ""Mambo No. 5"". The melancholy ""Crack in the Union Jack"" provides a welcome acoustic touch in all the electronic effects and is the perfect album closer. Brett & Co. continue to do most everything right. I look forward to where Suede goes with their next one."
2,"""Surprising"" New Release by the Suede Boys","What do you do if your previous CD had 5 top ten UK hits? Well how about change producers, simplify your lyrics and music, and limit the output of the song-writing team that wrote 4 of those 5 top ten UK hits. No one would do that, right? Suede is the exception. ""Head Music"" has, like always, the strong yet effeminate vocal delivery of Brett Anderson. However, he alone has written the majority of tunes on this release. The album's consistency suffers because of that. Anderson is a very good writer, especially lyrics, but musically he is not as consistent. Richard Oakes, the very talented young guitarist/writer, is seemingly held back by contributing to only co-writing three of the 13 cuts on the album. Now, I can understand if the band wants to do something a bit different but to lessen the quality of the work is disapointing."
4,Broke their own rules . .,"It is understandable that people want a band to keep putting out the same sounding album because they loved the previous releases so much. Suede broke out and went in a direction that is dance meets Marvin Gaye's ""What's Going On."" The band went in a direction of fabulous catchy riffs and memorable hooks with a dance feel. Most unhappy reviews complain the band did not put out Dog Man Star II. They already took that album a step further with Richard Oakes and the amazing Coming Up. I am in the minority that feels Suede improved with the departure of Butler. And there is even more reason to cherish this release as Suede returned to a rock sound on their next release making this their only foray onto the dance floor."
2,Proof that Butler made them the best?,"Suede have gone on a slow downhill fall since Butler left. ""Coming Up"" was a good listen and well worth your time. ""Head Music"" however is a disaster. All the lyrics are the same ""Shesss sooo"" Suede formula and the ones that aren't are just pure rubbish. ""Elephant Man"" is just an insult. The music sounds like a bad video game's soundtrack. ""Electricity"" is the only good song on this album and that's not saying much. Brett Anderson needs to write something a bit more memorable or they've lost my respect. If you're new to Suede and reading this, stay away from this album and go get their self-titled and ""Dog Man Star"". Even ""Coming Up"", anything but this album."
2,"""Electricity"" - the Best Song David Bowie Never Wrote","The opening song ""Electricity"" is one of their very best. It's like a total freefall into the Velvet Goldmine Era of echo-y Glam vocals layered over Fuzz guitar.As for the rest of the album...not so memorable."
2,Not good at all.,"I can't understand how so many people grant this four or five stars, unless they're friends of the band or work for the record company. The only interesting song is Electricty, the rest is dreadfully dull. If it wasn't for track one, the aforementioned Electricty, I'd never listen to this again."
2,I Can't Believe This Is A Suede Record - Simply Dreadful!,"Like some of the other reviewers here, I too loved Suede first few outings. I even loved Coming Up. Head Music is neither thoughful or ironic, it's not even catchy. It's dull, dull, dull record, with little heart and absolutely no feeling. it only gets a 2 because of past history. Think of it more as a 1.7.It makes me so mad that they released this garbage. That may sound a bit harsh, but when you consider the work before this and what they could be doing, well...you get the nausea.The B-Sides double disc is a far better use of your Suede money. Now, let's all keep our fingers crossed on what in my opinion will be the tell tale record for them this year."
1,Awful,"I'm sorry, but this is awful. I loved the first two albums, and liked Coming Up, but this album NO! Apart from the odd good song, most are simplified awful and embarrasing tunes. Elephant Man is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS."
1,suede and their influences,what a completely boring album by suede. why has this band who once achieved SOMETHING musically produced such a tragic record? it appears they stopped listening to all other bands and decided to listen only to their own records for an influence specifically coming up. gone is the baroch bowie loveyness and we have an album of boring songs with the following key words featured in most of them 1. car parks 2. trainers (shoes) 3. council estate....... its rubbish!!
1,A few songs worth it (unless you're Suede fan),"Nothing to say about this dissapointing Suede album. Butler is one of the gratest musicians of the last decade, and Brett is a real poet (and a extraordinary singer). That combination was perfect. This album fades more and more as a whole with every listening. The survivors?: ""Everything will flow"", ""He's gone"" and ""She's in fashion"". ""Low"" is a pretty song, but don't qualifies to a ""canonical songs"" Suede list. Try ""Comming Up"" instead and buy the 'Everything will flow single'."
3,A shade of let down,"I guess attempting to follow up the brilliant ""Coming Up"" was too difficult a task and instead of sticking to dirty glam, Suede stole a page from U2 and decided to wash their songs in electronica. The album is not terrible by any stretch of the imagination, just not a ""we're better without ya' Bernard"" statement like the previous."
4,The Best English Group Of The 90's.,"In typical fashion,Suede put another gut-hitter.Like most fans,I was a bit wondering & quite worried on whether one of my most favored groups would pull it again this time just as they've always done.Well,with first listen,I knew what they really are.The best.I wasn't dissapointed.""Electicity"" got better with time;""Savoir Faire"" made me admire them all the more;""Can't Get Enough"" is a classic light rocker in the T-Rex vein;""Everything Will Flow"" is as cleansing as it could get;""Down"" is one of the loveliest ballads of the decade.""She's In Fashion"" is Brett touching in one of his most favorite topics;the title track is a classic.Though the last three songs may be considered to be the weakest,one should just listen to them more closely to fully appreciate them.The best English group in their consistently finest,packing in & delivering the goods once again."
3,"Not their best, still o.k.","I really miss the ability to lose myself in the newer albums the way that I did with the debut album and Dog Man Star. Head Music and Coming up are not bad albums, but they don't have the atmospheric, magical quality that the first albums did. Head Music is musically more in your face and simplified. Favorite tracks include: Everything Will Flow, She's In Fashion, Asbestos and Electricity. I still consider Suede a good band even with out Bernard, but what were they thinking when they recorded Elephant Man?"
3,Cyberpop,"Suede has certainly changed. Gone is the emotive guitarwork and seductive singing. But you wouldn't want any band to keep repeating itself, would you? The only thing similar about this album are the lyrics. They're obviously pulled from singer Brett Anderson's bag of ten words of post-industrial angst. All that aside, this is pretty fresh stuff. Finally, Richard Oakes has stopped trying to ape former guitarist, Bernard Butler. This time around, Oakes' stripped-down guitar adds just the right punctiation to Anderson's sassy neo-glam rants. The new keyboardist also works well and fills in any would-be gaps with nice sustained textures. It's bubblegum for the year 2000. This is one slick, fun, rocker of an album. Just don't take this, or any other pop music album, too seriously and you'll have a great time."
2,What happened?,This is pretty average stuff. Lot's of retreads of melodies and riffs that were pretty lame the first time. I've been listening to the far superior Coming Up and pretending it's their new release. I suggest you do the same.
4,A NEW GROUP TO WATCH,If you like Wilco or The Jayhawks- you will love these guys. They are English but sound like Americans. I suppose they should be catagorised under alt.country. The only slight drawback I have with the album is that it is slightly too downbeat. But thats only a minor quibble. I guarantee that you'll enjoy this album.
2,Beware the title of the book,"The title in big font says ""Embedded Internet Devices"" but in small font says ""Using the TINI Microcontroller"". Though it is a good intro to network basics and using a specific internet-ready TINI board to create a HTTP based system, it is not enough for someone who would like to use other devices or other protocols (like telnet and FTP).Great intro to CAN networking, Java communications classes, 1-wire comm, and I2C bus. But I have to give it low stars due to mis-leading title of the book.In short, this is the second Newnes book I've been somewhat disappointed with."
4,Great sound for cheap price,"Sounds great, however rattle when overpowered, which is sadly at lower level than would hope. Otherwise great purchase. Man, I need subs..."
5,MUST BUY!,"So, thinking of purchasing the awesomeness that is NPH in ""Dr. Horrible""? GO AHEAD! The DVD is all it's hyped up to be and more. It includes the three webisodes, musical commentary, supervillain auditions, and more! It really is an awesome buy at a low price!"
5,"Lots of fun, I wish it was longer","This DVD is a blast. I wish there were more episodes or that it was much longer. It is obviously done in a rather tongue in cheek manner, but it's very entertaining."
4,More than I expected,"This movie musical is hilarious, hands down!As an actor, I can appreciate the humor and the characters within the show, all overdone (which is how most musicals are)As a musician I am slightly disappointed only because these actors are not necessarily singers.Ultimately, if your looking for a cute story with comedy and a good time, Dr. Horrible is for you. If your more into the actual quality of music when looking for a musical, look elsewhere."
5,extras worth the price alone,"I'd seen the entire production online, but today the dvd arrived and I'm watching the extras. I haven't even gotten to ""Commentary: THE MUSICAL"" yet, but the behind the scenes and video applications to the Evil League of Evil are worth the hideously meager $9.99 price alone. I'm giving this (sadly non-celophaned) to a friend as a hostess gift tomorrow cos' she just HAS to see this, and just ordered several more for folk I won't see til next week. What a fun treat!!!"
3,Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,"** Dr. Horrible isn't your typical movie short. In fact, it isn't your typical anything. What it is, is Joss Whedon. It is a fun little thing he created during the writers' strike, and it is fun to watch. It's corny, and it's hokey, but it IS fun.** Joss Whedon may not be a genius, but anyone who could create Buffy, Angel, Firefly, and (coming soon), Dollhouse, is as close as you can come without the actual title. I enjoyed ""Dr. Horrible"" on the Web, and enjoyed it even more on the DVD.** Considering that it is reasonable cheap, and that there are some good Extras, I would recommend than any fan of Joss and his other creations buy this DVD."
5,Awesome,It's Just awesome to finally have a not youtube quality version of this. This is definitely my favorite internet musical! Seriously though if you have seen this before you will definitely appreciate the commentaries (especially the musical one!) And if you haven't seen this yet you are missing out.
5,Extras from Joss!!!,"It was quite amazing and significant that Joss Whedon produced Dr. Horribles Sing Along Blog during the writers strike. Not only was it incredidly done, offered free over the internet, and turned into a dvd, but Joss once again outdoes himself by including a ""MUSICAL COMMENTARY"", thats right a ""MUSICAL COMMENTARY"" on the dvd. He also includes a regular commentary as well.Dr. Horribles Sing Along Blog begins with Dr. Horrible discussing his application to the League of Evil, and through the process, inadvertently introduces his nemesis Captain Hammer to the girl of his dreams, Penny. It was well done. Hats off you you Joss!I always said that I would continue to support these types of media. When this came out on DVD I was going to buy it regardless, but was pleasantly surprised with the extras included with it.You won't be dissapointed!"
5,Dr. Horrible is fun for he whole family,I saw Dr. Horrible when a friend dragged me in front of his computer to watch act one. All I knew at the time was the people who were in it and that I hated musicals. After watching all three acts and loving every minute of it I jumped at the chance to buy it on DVD. I think this is one of the best works by Joss Whedon and eventhough not really for the kiddies I think it is fun for the whole family.
5,A jolly good time.,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-along Blog is a joy to watch, and it is one of the first movies I go to when it's my turn to host movie night. This short film has delighted me and my friends for awhile now via YouTube, but I gotta say that the experience is just all the more enhanced to watch it on the television in DVD quality. The humor is superb, as is the acting and storyline. Also, its nice to see something NOT end like a happy storybook. I look forward to seeing if they ever put out the full length movie as they've promised."
5,Horribly Good,"This was free on the internet so is it worth buying a DVD? You bet it is! The extras make it totally worthwhile. ""Commentary: the Musical"" is hysterical and the ordinary (as if, with this crew) commentary is pretty darn entertaining as well.One word of caution: this is a region free DVD and may not work in some players. It doesn't work in my old DVD player but works fine in my computer. If you only have one way to play it, you may want to make sure it'll work first."
4,DHSAB = Timeless Delight DVD = Pretty Nifty,"While I think the actual production of DHSAB is fabulous and contains all the wonderful bits of good comedy and tragedy along with the bon mots and sweetness that is Joss Whedon and everyone alive should watch and enjoy this production, I have to knock a few points on the DVD.There are no subtitles for the Commentary! musical which makes it impossible to understand some parts with no lips to watch, let alone deaf peeps. You can't flip to a single ELE application and the menu flipping is a bit sticky (a common Joss Whedon DVD issue). The Commentary! won't give you much new material if you know all the stories already (and will be funnier if you do), but is still worth a few hearty laughs."
3,Horrible Ain't,Dr. Horrible was not horrible. It was a modestly humorous melodrama that spotlighted Harris's talents and some excellent writing but lacks it's own personality and style. I would like more but not much!
2,DVD skips,"The DVD sometimes runs on my player and some time it doesn't, and can't seems to get the special feature, like commentary and making, to play.Also, it skips as well"
2,Surprisingly not a fan,"I generally love all things Joss Whedon and didn't hesitate to order this when it was released on blu-ray. I watched it and surprisingly was disappointed. Looking over the zillion 5-star ratings, I'm obviously alone. I found it kind of boring despite really liking the cast. I felt disconnected rather than endeared by the absurdity of it all. The abrupt ending was the nail in the coffin. I'll certainly give it a second spin and hopefully I'll finally see why folks are heaping praise."
4,Fun!,"My husband and I loved this video. I'd heard about it on the internet, but not seen it, then I saw it was released on video. Had to have it based on other's reviews!If you like Joss Whedon, you'll love this fun, campy, musical. The story is cute-the ""good"" guy gets his in a satisfying way, and the end is a cool twist.I didn't know Neil Patrick Harris could sing, this was a nice surprise. Nathan Fillion is always good entertainment. And Felicia Day was a lovely addition, making an all-around good show."
5,I love it!!!,"I love this movie. I love Neil Patrick Harris's voice, what an amazing voice. I love the music, and storyline. By far my favorite movie."
5,"Dr. Horrible---not horrible, actually it's amazing!!","Dr. Horrible's sing-a-long blog is hilarious! Any fan of Neil Patrick Harris or Joss Whedon needs to get their hands on this immediately. The DVD is both extremely reasonably priced and totally worth paying for, there are several special features (including ""Commentary, the musical!"" and many featurettes). Fantastic cast, crew, writers, and such fun to watch!"
5,Dr Horrible is Horribly Good,"This is the classic superhero story twisted upside down and turned into a musical. As strange as that sounds you would think Dr Horrible would be bound for the grave, yet within 5 minutes of watching, I was hooked.A behind the scenes look of life from a want-to-be-supervillian, this story gives you a natural feel. Dr Horrible's (Neil Patrick Harris) video blogs helps set the tone. His clumsy behavior makes him realistic and believable and not so evil. While Captain Hammer's (Nathan Fillion) ego reinforces that life is more than just black and white. Felicia Day is the lovely Penny who inspires Dr Horrible, and inspires Captain Hammer with another way to dig at Dr Horrible.The songs are addictive, and extremely easy to get into your head. Suddenly you will find yourself singing a song from it and laughing. All in all, a rather twisted addictive tale by Joss Whedon"
5,OMG LMAO,"I would never for a minute believe that I would crowing the merits of an obscure, web released musical starring ""Doogie Howser"". I'd heard about Dr. Horrible on NPR and thought my girlfriend might get a kick out of a gag birthday gift. The next thing I knew, we were watching the full movie for the second time after thoroughly enjoying commentary the musical (a full length commentary with new original songs).I wish it were longer, even though the bonus features more than make up for the brevity, I just didn't want it to end. Dr. Horrible is a definite must see and I am ecstatic that I own it."
5,Dr. Horrible saved the dat,This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. I actually got them on Itunes when they first came out and loved it so much that I felt compelled to buy the DVD to help the cause. The cast did such a great job. NPH can sing!
3,Firefly only fan,"Got the dvd based on the reviews and in hopes that I might like it...BUT I didn't laugh one time. The only thing that I've liked of Joss Whedon's work has been Firefly and the movie Sirenity So if this describes you then maybe you should save yourself the money and try to watch it free on the internet. Yes, the songs were catchy and the actors did great but I wouldn't give it the high reviews that it's been getting...As for Firefly fans...the only other tv show that reminds me of Firefly is the animation tv shows Trigun and Cowboy Bebop...its got the cowboy honor, drama, comedy, and spaceships. If anyone can think of other shows like Firefly please post a reply comment."
2,I'd call it Sophomoric ....,"Except even my High School sophomore son didn't like it. The surreal isn't surreal enough, every plot turn is predictable, and the songs are not very interesting. Could have been so much funnier. We're huge fans of Firefly and Serenity, so perhaps our expectations were too high."
1,Burned DVD Read Error,"I haven't been able to watch the movie yet. It arrived, surprisingly as a ""home-burned"" (purple read surface) DVD disc. The disc also had a scratch on it out of the box, but I don't know if it won't load or play because of the scratch, or the ""burned"" nature of the disc. The ""home-made"" burned style disc is disappointing. There are places that REPLICATE DVDs in the same method as movies at the store. I have used these services and they cost about $1-2 a disc in quantities over 1000. Replicated (silver, ""store-type"") DVDs have the highest compatibility.Amazon does have the DVD-R note at the bottom of the product description. I received it as a gift, and am requesting a replacement through Amazon. Amazon made it easy to print a return mailing label.I look forward to seeing the movie."
5,Awesome!,I LOVE 'Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog' The songs are great the casting was perfect and it is something that I can watch over and over!!
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"I personally love the stupid humor....and this....this didn't fail me at all! The only issue I had with it....it's too short! Even with the short length of the feature I found it to be wonderful and absolutely hilarious, I watch it whenever I am in dark humor mood and need a lift in spirits!"
5,Not at all horrible,"For those not familiar with the concept, Dr. Horrible is a romantic super-villain musical, which is just as bizarre and charming as it sounds. It's written and directed by Joss Whedon (of Buffy/Angel/Firefly/Serenity fame), who is a man who knows how to put together some tight, polished, good quality entertainment.I suppose the important things for the DVD review are the region code and the extras. This DVD is region-free; I don't remember reading that in the product description, so held off on buying it for ages waiting for a European release, but it should work on any DVD player around the world. Also, the extras make the DVD well worth purchasing. ""Commentary: The Musical"" is great fun, hearing the cast and crew bicker through the medium of song; and the application videos for the Evil League of Evil are entertaining, and show the kind of level of effort enthused Whedon fans go to."
4,Let wanting more.,"From what little I had heard I was not expecting much but since it was a Joss Whedon project I knew I had to give it a shot. Now I'm glad I did. By the end I was saying ""it can not be over""! I was amazed how fast I was drawn in. If you liked the Buffy musical episode then just click buy now. You will not be disappointed. If you thought it was the worst of the series then you might want to rent it first."
5,Very enjoyable,"I heard about this DVD on NPR. I like Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion, so I figured I'd give it a try. It's really great! It's corny and campy & touching & sweet. The muscial commentary audio track is very funny. I would recommend this to anyone who is a NPH, Nathan Fillion or Josh Whedon fan."
3,"The movie is 5 stars, the Blu Ray...not so much.","Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog [Blu-ray]This is a review of the May 25th release of the Dr. Horrible Blu-ray.As a sat down to watch this movie this afternoon I have to say that I was really disappointed in the picture quality. The colors were mostly ok, but a lot of scenes seemed washed out or blown out. The biggest and most glaring thing you notice with this Blu-ray is the grain. Every flat background is so grainy that it feels a bit like VHS grain, only finer.My setup doesn't really qualify me to comment on the audio quality so I won't.The movie as a stand-alone product is fantastic and I think previous reviews cover it just as well as I can. If you don't own this in any media you really need to but it, but don't expect great things from this Blu-ray."
5,So worth the measly asking price,Joss' review was spot on. We should all be buying this DVD every day forever. Commentary! has quite a few good tunes on it and the regular commentary track was also very enjoyable. I keep getting impressed at the sound quality of the music. They were all recorded at Whedon's home studio. Must be some home studio!Really nothing I can add to what has already been said of the Dr H movie (movette? It is rather short for a movie). It's great.
5,Absolutely amazing,"What can I say, this was amazing. But be warned, you have to be nerd or have a nerd streak to like this. That said, this is great! I loved this.I want there to be a sequel but I fear a part 2 would destroy the magic of this. Like how the first Blair Witch Project was great but the second one was so planned out and Hollywoodized it sucked. Either way, Dr. Horrible will live on.If you liked this, you will loveGentlemen BroncosCaptain Hammer was great. Perfect Alpha male idiot hero. A great satire on super heroes.And the special features are pretty good too. Go to the ELE applications and look for The Reverend. That was amazing as well.PSBe warned, it is only 42 minutes roughly."
4,"Love the content, but missing easter eggs??","I absolutely love Dr. Horrible, which is the only reason why I bought it on blu ray when it's available online for free. I especially wanted to see all the special features and easter eggs, so imagine my dismay when the easter eggs don't seem to work! I'm not sure if I just couldn't access them because my blu ray player is a PS3 so I don't have the regular controls, but I tried everything I could think of and nothing happens! If anyone knows how to solve this, please let me know!I'm very disappointed and thinking about returning the blu ray and getting a DVD instead just so I can get to the easter eggs!"
5,PERFECT,It was a gift for our son. He absolutely loves it. He has watch it over and over. Completed satisfied.
3,A little shocked,"I purchased this because I am a fan of some of Joss Whedon's work, and an even larger fan of most of Nathon Fillion's work. I even used to watch the old Doogie Houser(?) MD TV show back in the day. After watching this; however, I am left astounded at the hundreds of five-star reviews for something that looks like a high-schooler could've produced, and possibly done a better job too. There wasn't anything particularly bad about this, it had it's moments for sure, but there's nothing particularly great or groundbreaking either. If you're interested in anything this has to offer do yourself a favor and watch it for free somewhere first. Don't spend your money on this, or anything for that matter, if you don't have to."
5,The best... EVER!!!,This is genius. Pure genius. I think I might be obsessed. The music is INCREDIBLE!
5,"More like ""Dr. Great!""","Very funny. Very well acted. Very exciting in terms of directing. Very Berry Sundae, and most importantly, I thought that the character archetypes ring true between any social, policital, and geographical boundries."
5,Brilliant,"This is great stuff. Unusual, eccentric, very very silly, and quite brilliant. Loved every moment, and the extra bit where the cast sings about the show (where they'd usually be talking about it) is inspired. The songs are rather catchy too, after the second viewing you'll find them sticking in your head.I hear there's a sequel planned and will be lining up to get that."
5,Exactly what I was hoping for,"Nothing but pure enjoyment from this DVD. All of the extras are entertaining and I'm willing to watch the entire thing multiple times just to hear all the commentary. This is a rarity for a DVD for me. I wish that this came with the soundtrack though, I don't want to have to purchase it seperately."
5,C'mon...Joss Whedon!,"Plus, it has an audio commentary track that is one continuous musical. How awesome is that? Few authors can make me laugh and cry in the same minute. Joss Whedon can."
5,Pure Awesome.,"Sing a long! Laugh! Cry! Everyone in this is awesome, I love watching it and singing along! I watch it regularly!"
3,Disappointed,"I am a Whedon fan but I was disappointed in this. There were a few good lines that made us laugh, but overall this was not a great show. As a fan of both Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillon, I had some expectations of this movie and they were not met in any way."
5,Dr. Horrible's Amazon Revew,"Awesome! This DVD is Awesome!You've remembered dear DoogieYou've watched Harold and KumarYou've seen How I Meet your Mother.Now heres a short filmYou simply must see it!Send a copy to your brother!From Firefly, comes the guyWhose handsome and tallBut due to a writer strikeHe's in this musicalThe Hammer is a toolHe acts like a foolBut all think he's coolExcept the bad doctorWho says he has found herThe girl that he lovesDoes not know what he doesHe's evil and badBut the girl is so goodHow must a villian do things that are badWhen the girl that he loves makes him gladWhen you find out you will definitely be sadBut that Captain Hammer makes him so mad!Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan FillonStar in this musical film by Joss WhedonIt may not be Buffy or have Summer GlauBut trust me and buy this movie right now!"
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"I watched this movie on the recommendation of a friend. And then I immediately showed it to every living person I've ever met, because it is amazing!I don't much care for musicals, but the music in this movie is so good that I've listened to the soundtrack on youtube more than a few times. Don't do that first, though, because it'll ruin the plot, which is the best part.The plot had me completely hooked from the beginning. Dr. Horrible, who is an out-of-luck super genius with half-baked plans for fixing our broken world, is such an honest character played so well by Neil Patrick Harris that I think I felt every emotion the character did the entire way through the plot. That's not something I can say about many goofy superhero musicals - or many movies period.It's honest, a bit dark, and really funny. I recommend it to anyone who likes anything. Just watch it, already!"
5,The Internet Hit is now on DVD!,"For those of us who loved Dr. Horrible when it was the internet sensation, I can totally say that the DVD is worth buying.Better video and sound quality, lots of fun extras and the ability to loan it to others is awesome.Hey Joss, bypass the hollywood nonsense and just release to the fans. We'll buy it."
5,best supervillain musical ever!,"i can't recommend this enough. i'd never seen it on the internet (i'm video disabled) but would have ordered the DVD for the special features anywayseriously: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hum along and tap your foot"
4,Incredibly Different,"I'd read the reviews on how great this is but still took a big punt on it. Man, this is an amazing movie. I actually found myself slapping my knee at one stage because I was laughing so much."
5,Superb,There's not enough good things that can be said about Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.It's simply stunning.
5,So good,"I bought the dvd for my boyfriend. We had already seen this and loved it, and when i heard the commentary was a sing along, it was a must have. funny and creative. and it has nph (neil patrick harris)."
5,Simply awesome,Dr. Horrible is one of the most entertaining and original productions ever created. The fact that this was done with no big budget studio support makes it that much more endearing.
5,Finally!!!!,"All I have to add is this...Joss we need more installments Of Dr. Horrible, really we do!"
5,good comedy,"this is a good comedy my husband loved thid when he was on his computer one day then i saw this on amazon and bought it for him, he thought it was great he laughs the whole time"
4,Dr Horrible's sing a long blog,"This was a very funny movie. A very different story line, expertly done by Jos and the Cast."
5,Absolute flippin' genius!,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog is one of the funniest things I have ever watched. I absolutely adore Joss Whedon and think pretty much everything he touches turns to gold, but this is perfect on so many levels. The casting is incredible. Nathan Fillion is one of the most amazing actors EVER, in my opinion. His usual charm is played into the perfect 'corporate tool'. A good guy who is just so cheesy. I love him. NPH is incredibly awesome and just loveable enough to be the bad-guy you want to root for. And Felicia Day is super cute! The songs are great and I dare you to not get them stuck in your head. I love this so much, I can't imagine anyone not loving it. I think everyone should at least try it."
4,Wonderful Story and Songs!,Terrific script; funny and direct. It seems like they had fun making it and that is manifest in their chemistry.
5,"Wow, sarcasm! That's original!","Love this movie, I watched it repeatedly when it was first made and streaming online. I am glad to now own the Blu-ray quality version of it."
5,Perfection,"Awesome web series, with subtitles in a lot of languages, full of juicy extras and no region lock.I wish more DVD/Bluray editions would be like this. They would probably sell more copies."
5,"Buy this and ""destroy the status quo because the status is not...quo""","Conceived during the latest Writer's strike, Joss and company wrote (and in some cases, starred in) this instant classic (TAKE THAT, DISNEY!). It is #2 on my all-time favorites list...#1 being The Princess Bride (inconceivable, I know). I was privileged to be in Hollywood on Halloween to see the first charity screening. Joss, Nathan and Felicia commented on just recording some of the dialog for the commentary. I have no doubt the commentary is every bit as good as the musical itself. If not, may the Bad Horse make me his mare!Ed. note: watched (listened to) the commentary. While it's not as good as the actual movie, it was enjoyable for what it was...a shameless plug to get us all to buy the DVD...er, a masterful commentary on Felicia Day's ""process""."
5,Amazing deal!,"The actual movie is fantastic, if a bit short (45min), but you take that combined with all of the special features and you've got one smart purchase thats for sure... in the 3 weeks or so that I have owned it I have watched it at least ten times. Yeah, its that good."
4,"Great ""Sing-Along""","Product arrived quickly, in fine condition (new). Whole family enjoyed (my son was the originator of order)."
5,"Great Music, Story","Really fun little show, only bad part is it's too short. I'd say the lyrics are PG-13."
1,Great Movie - Craptastic DVD!,"Don't bother. This isn't even a real DVD, it is a cheap copy of a DVD. If the people who manufactured this DVD had bothered they could have fit a 1080i version of the movie on a single DVD9 and given you Blu-Ray quality for a DVD price.Instead they took a low quality 480p version of the movie and just ran it off onto some spare blank DVD-R's they had lying around. You can get a higher quality version of the movie from iTunes than what is included on the DVD. It is a complete and total rip off.Tell the producers to get back to me when they feel like putting together a quality product. I threw this thing in the trash after one viewing of this low quality pixelated garbage."
1,"Love Dr. Horrible, hated Amazon's medium.","I originally watched Dr Horrible in HD. The quality of this movie if you watch it online is TERRIBLE. On top of that, it was not made clear that I would have to download software (""Unbox""??) in order to view the movie. I was going to buy this for my dad for Father's Day, but he doesn't like to download software to access media (he doesn't even have iTunes), so now I can't really send this to him, either. When you see something that says you can download a movie, I should be able to download THE MOVIE, not some software that will allow me to view a low-res version. I have a Mac, so I can't download the crappy software. I will not be buying any movies through Amazon again. Chances are, I won't be getting a refund either.I think everyone should watch Dr Horrible, but don't use Amazon's service. Buy it on DVD and have it mailed."
1,Dissapointing,"This was made during the writers strike from a few years back. It's not very original, the songs arn't great, but I don't care for musicals anyway, so your mileage may vary. Over all, it was kind of boring and difficult to sit through the whole thing."
1,I just don't get it,"I watched 15 agonizing minutes of this because of the high ratings on amazon. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The songs are awful, the story is awful, the acting is awful. How this is getting so many 5 star reviews is beyond me. Is this a joke no one told me about?"
1,A complete waste of time,"In a nutshell, boring. A poorly written, stupidly cliche plot attempting to make light of itself and supervillans everywhere. The title alone tells you absolutely everything about this monstrosity.If you are a fan of humor that is completely spelled out for you in excruciating detail (ie. the onion) then you will love it. If, however, you prefer not to be beaten over the head with a premise that is the only joke... you will turn it off after about 2-3 minutes. We get it, you're making fun of a cliche. Now what?Now I go watch something else."
3,"Content is great, but disappointed with disc quality and Amazon","First let me say that the content on the disc itself is great, but Amazon is not being completely honest with it's product descriptions.On the top of the page, it says that the disc format is DVD, but if you buy it, there is a possibility that they will send you a burned DVD-R instead of a pressed DVD disc. This can be an issue because DVD-Rs are not as durable over time and some DVD players cannot read them.You can tell if you received a DVD-R if it is a purple backed DVD-R disc. I didn't even realize this was a possibility until I opened the package and saw it since the product description doesn't even mention it except for in small print at the bottom of the page. I'm disappointed that Amazon couldn't shell out for a release of consistent quality.UPDATE: Amazon recently changed the DVD logo on the top of the product page to DVD-R making the product description more accurate."
3,Not traditional Prayers of the Hours,"Each day in this book consists of four more or less equal pieces: a prayer each for morning, midday, and evening and a Scripture reading. The prayers, themselves, are primarily oriented towards the welfare of the individual praying. ""Prayers of the Hours"" generally refers to Psalm based corporate prayer, therefore I consider the title to be somewhat misleading.Judging them for what they are - individually oriented set prayers - I find them good but not excellent. They tend to use the same sentence structure (which is heavy on lists) in a way that I find obtrusive - the format overshadows content. The content is good but in no way does it stand out from any number of other daily prayer aids.Some will find that this book truly meets their needs; for the rest of us, we can find better resources."
2,Difficult to use,"The concept and construction of this accessory are great, but the instructions only state how to attach it to the camera: you have to zoom way too much to fill the screen with the image of the slide you're trying to copy, a tripod is needed to hold it rock-steady. the camera won't auto focus, and you have to manually focus and it takes quite a few passes to get it right. I rate this item in the ""ballbuster"" category, but it will work if you have a calm mind."
2,I Thought it Was Warren Miller,"I bought this for my husband because he loves Warren Miller. However, we were so disappointed because there was NO Warren Miller. Skiing was fine but it didn't have the Warren Miller humor, narration, etc. Even the filming was not ""Warren Milleresque."" Disappointing."
4,Awesome,Movie was great. I always love to start the ski season by getting amped up by a Warren Miller movie!
1,Let's be HONEST,This is a release by people who BOUGHT the NAMING RIGHTS and Company from Warren Miller. This film has ABSOLUTELY NO INVOLVEMENT from Warren Miller nor has any released by WME since 2004.
3,Haven't seen any noticeable change in skin after 2 weeks,"I still have high hopes for this product but thus far, after 2 weeks of spreading a film of the cream each night I've not seen any sort of change. I will continue to use for the 3 months and will write further if I see a noticeable change.Edited - Nov. 2011I continued to use this and find it to be a big waste of money. It has not evened my skin tone which is what I had been using it for nor has it lightened my age spots. And I've found that it tends to get gunky when you smooth over your face, isn't creamy. I would stay away from this product - it's pretty cheap so you get what you pay for."
1,Clog ur pores,"I didn't notice any improvement at all on my hyperpigmentation spots, but i did noticed how it clogged my pores."
2,Caused me to break out !,"Porcelana DOES lightening acne scars, BUT it made me break out. So what was the point?I have skin that can tolerate most skin products, no matter how harsh or gentle. It also smells nice."
2,No results for me,This product did not work for me. I used it every night for months and my dark spot never faded. After a while my skin got extremely sensitive from this product so I have since stopped using it.
2,Don't buy this stuff.,This was fairly ineffective. I applied this as prescribed. Saw no results and ended up throwing out the bottle.Be happy with your skin or skin tone.
1,wierdest pasty consistency,"its so hard to work with spreading it out and rubbing into he skin, you have to pull and tug"
3,It Helps to Fade Scars,"I probably should have given this 4-stars instead of 3-stars but I think my expectations were higher than they should have been. I was really looking for something that would make my scars disappear; however, this product will greatly lighten scars (I can't speak for all scars or everyone's skin) with regular use. I was looking for a miracle in a jar which doesn't exist.Would I used this product again? Probably... if my goal was to lighten existing scars. I have so much scarring I don't think anything would work to get rid of the discoloration in entirety but I would recommend it to someone that would be happy to just reduce the appearance of scars or uneven skin tone."
4,repulsive and intriguing all at the same time,"I heard about this book on NPR so it seemed like a pretty good bet. When I first started reading the book, I was a little disgusted by the explicitness of the sexual acts depicted. But once I got past the initial shock, I couldn't stop reading. If you want to read something other than the usual, read this book. However, if you can't get past the graphic and lurid details of s&m acts, I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,"not comparable to Bradt, Lonely Planet etc","Bought this unseen off Amazon while trying to assemble a library of travel books. This is certainly NOT intended for the casual reader who wants to familiarise himself with the country, and to see a few photos, but to be fair it is informative for the traveler, with lists of restaurants, vital phone numbers, travel details and descriptions of towns. But it doesnt 'grab' you unless you're after specific facts"
5,Amazing story...,"This book was referred to me by a friend, and I'm glad she did. I usually don't read spiritual books but I found that I couldn't put this one down. It's an amazing story that really makes you think about one's life and the afterlife. Marci's experiences are quite remarkable and I really felt through her words what she was experiencing. It has opened my eyes to the possibilities of what lies beyond and what is possible even in this life. If Marci could overcome the pain and trauma of her past, what can I overcome in my life? This book is truly a remarkable and inspirational story. Thank you Marci for sharing your experiences with the world."
3,"An interesting, creepy story.","While I was underwhelmed with this book at the beginning, it eventually reeled me in and got me involved with the characters and the mystery. The climax of the book is quite tense and effective. However, I was offended by some remarks made by the main character, psychologist Diane Cheung, during the final conflict. I haven't quite decided whether these close-minded views are those of the character or the author himself."
3,Not the Best,"I bought this book to review for the AP Micro-Macro exams with little consideration of other options. I'd advise you to do otherwise, namely, to buy another book.To me, the review of concepts in this book seemed minmal. Although the book's cover says it includes 2 sample tests, it really only includes 1 -- 1 micro and 1 macro.It's not that Apex Learning's book is terrible, because it's not -- I just think that, after reading some of the reviews of the Princeton Review Economics book, I regretted buying this one."
3,Usa Coaches Clincs July 1999,"It had many useful tips and ideas on how to coach and how to build a program and etc., It is a book for all begginer coaches and it will set a foundation for them to build on and to learn from."
2,Returned item,"Picture appeared to indicate the shelf was curved in the front. It was actually curved in the middle, resulting in very little useable space. It is an attractive shelf, but oddly shaped."
2,A Very Difficult Read,"I had high hopes for this book. I am a fan of military history and looked forward to gaining an insight into the various armaments throughout history and how they affected battles and history itself. What I found was more overview than in-depth understanding, and the book is more lecture driven than exploration. And as the book got closer to the 20th century, the author devoted page after boring page to the concepts of war, and appears to have forgotten the title of his book entirely, abandoning any references to armament entirely. Enjoy the title, avoid the book."
2,A good way to support local indies....,"My wifes' review:I was super excited to watch this and support it as a local and indie film!The movie had some funny bits and a few good lines.The sound quality and voice dubs were annoying. The acting and directing could have been a wee better, though were on par with other low-budget indies I've seen.Mine:I actually didn't like the movie. I didn't find it funny and I just didn't care about what was happening to the characters. I am impressed that the production staff was able to complete a full length movie, which is no small feat. The sound quality was difficult to take, as the voices all had the same level since they re-dubbed it. There are other movies in this quality level that are more successful as an indie, like Jame Westby's ""The Auteur"" or Smartistics's ""The Book Club"".I would still watch another movie from this production company though."
5,A Realistic and Sobering Look at Life in Poverty in America,"It will bring tears to your eyes.This film is powerful. No narration, just reality coming at you in your face, in your gut.This is modern day Third World living in the United States of America that's happening right now. Not fifty years ago but RIGHT NOW.If you don't look differently at that last CD you bought, or that latte' you had yesterday, you have a heart of stone.If you say you care about anyone other than yourself and you don't choose to go into the world and DO SOMETHING after seeing this film, you may as well be dead. You can't be human and go back to life as usual after seeing this film."
4,AWESOME!,This has got to be one of my favorite documentaries. It still amazes and saddens me at how we have let our school systems down. If you have not seen this documentary you need to see because you will love it and it will open your eyes as to what is going on in this country and how we have dropped the ball where education is concerned for our children.
5,Well Done but Heart Wrenching,"I've had this in my collection for many years. This film holds special significance to me because I am not only from the Mississippi Delta but also be use my entire research career is dedicated to addressing the many complex issues surrounding poverty. The biggest peeve with the video is the subtitles that were put in to help some viewers understand the regional accents. This was a good idea, but it would have been much better if the subtitles had actually been correct. Otherwise it provides an accurate view of chronic poverty in one of the most impoverished regions in the U.S."
4,"A wonderful, elightening story","This book was amazingly brilliant. Judy Sheehan has a distinct style that makes the dialogue and even the narration read like real life, which, in turn, makes the characters come to life even more fully. Because this is very much a character-driven novel, you are pulled into Jane's struggles and deluged with her life as if you were living it. Sheehan captures the daily life of a single woman living in New York perfectly and more wonderfully describes the adoption process. Personally, I never knew that much about adoption, but after reading this book, I feel as if I was introduced to another world, and coming away from that, I now have a newfound respect for anyone who chooses to adopt. All in all, it's hard to read this book and not be drawn into Jane Howe's struggles, friendships, and bad dates, all of which are described with delightfully witty imagery."
3,Timeless Moments,It was a little slow. I wanted more to happen faster. The first and second chapters were great. The characters are great. I just wanted more to happen.
2,kindle version - bad layout,"the kindle version lacks proper punctionation which makes the read not very grabbing. the story on its own is interesting, but I found myself more interested in the storyline of the 'aliens' then of the enterprise crew. average book, could be better worked out."
3,Good but far from great,This book kept my attention. I never really cared for Pulaski but this made me see a better side of her. I think this is a little better than the average ST:TNG.
2,No call for this one,"The plot, involving the kidnapping of Enterprise crewmembers so that they can participate in war games for the entertainment of the masses, reads like something stolen from a fantasy novel for most of the pages. Worf gets to shine a little, but little else is very interesting here, mostly because the characters all have amnesia and are not truly themselves."
1,Note to self: check reviews for formatting issues!,"Story and writing are actually pretty solid; fun TNG read. But the formatting errors are so egregious as to be a constant irritant; really, really terrible.Whatever algorithm was used to process this book into kindle format should be sent to the big software farm upstate...."
4,I had to get one!,This watch is incredible! My roomate bought one so i figured it would be nice to get one for myself. We use it on campus all the time. It makes me feel like inspector gadget. And the ladies love it. Good Buy.
4,How?,I hope the watchclock would have at LEAST an extended battery and when the battery runs off do it has another battery just to display the hour?
5,A sneaky spy gadget,"I think it`s one of my best gadgets.I wear it at school `cause I`m not allowed to go play with my sister on the other side of the playground.I have a mean teacher so my sister and I think of plans to share with one another.Once I made chocolate chip cookies for her and said it was from the principal.It didn`t have chocolate chips,though it had the stuff that tastes like chocolate,but makes you have to go to the restroom.I also love to listen to the radio one the watch.I can`t do much at school so thats why I like it.I have a spy desk withs lots of gadgets.It also makes a stylish look`n watch."
3,okay,"I like the idea of having the 2 way radio on my wrist but I found it too thick and bulky. So its not exactly comfortable wearing it around. Also this (like any other 2 way radios) is not good for theme parks since everyone has a radio (cellphone still works best). This works for hiking or maybe inside a mall. They have a new version X3X out but I'm not sure if that is thinner. I also have a Motorola Talkabout Radio. It can call my motorola but my motorola can't call it back. I havent had any luck reaching Xact. If you call their tech support phone you will just get routed with all voicemessages, their email also bounces back. I got 4 and will return 2 of them and just wait for the next version."
3,Wrist Communicator,"I was pleased with the quality of the watch and the cool features, but you probably wont be carrying this thing around your office or school. It IS very bulky-- and you even have to charge it up(with an AC adapter provided.)"
1,Don't be fooled,"Please dont buy this item. The reasons are:-1) I bought 4 pieces of which i returned 2 coz the battery was dead on arrival, multiple charging didnt help.2) The XACT company's customer support was the worst, they said they wont send me replacement batteries, later they agreed to replace one if i bought one. This happenned the next day of purchase...!!!3) Then i sent them back to Amazon and i got my money refunded, minus shipping charges. I lost it for nothing.4) Most importantly, the product is not good at all. the range is less than 300ft and nowhere near comparable to miles.My advice, dont be fooled..."
3,Charge it every time after using it ?!,"It seems never can be charged fully after 20 hours charging. The charging indicator always display low level. Even if I don't use it for a week, I need to recharge it again for 12+ hours.Any one have same problem?Otherwise it's fun to use."
2,DONT BUY THIS WATCH,"this watch has one use: to look cool. that is all. The range is probably about half a mile, but thats better than my mororla 2 mile walkie talkie. My friend and I both got one. we live about a mile a part, and as I was walking over, I tried to contact him the whole way. It didn't work until I was very close.Both of the wristbands of the watches broke, ITS A HORRIBLE DESIGN. We were able to fix them by puting in a paper clip.The watch is to bulky to wear W/O looking like a total moron. WHAT A FAT WATCH.the battery is good though"
3,good stuff,"Very good item for the money, my daugthers like it very much. I will like to see a small version that could fit better in kids hands."
3,X2X,"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT USED!!!! I did and I am having problems with it every time I charge it. It is a fun toy however. Great for hiking and camping. It gets interferince if you are too close to other transmitters though. Scan feature comes in very handy, and the range isnt too bad, though I lost comm. after a few city blocks. Over all though, I would recomend it."
3,X2X WristLinx GMRS Wristwatch,"Very good quality product, as with all Xact items. I upgraded to the X33X models, though, because of the lack of subcarrier frequencies (privacy channels) on the X2X model.These little communicators are great for kids on a campout or for keeping track of the family at the mall. Range is about 1/2 mile in open, flat outdoors, much less indoors or where there is a lot of metal structural components. Great within a cubicled office. Good for car-to-car if you're in eyeball range of the other vehicle.The battery lasts about a year with normal use (recharge after use, about 4 - 6 hours on at a time, 3 - 4 times per month) - I found the replacement batteries a little pricey ($15 - $20 each with shipping), and there are no substitutes.For coolness and compact portability, these are neat little radios. I would recommend a spare set of batteries and a whistle if tromping through the woods."
1,They stopped working too many times,"I loved the idea of this product, and I bought a pair thinking of using it on ski trips. Unfortunately, one of the pair I bought was ""dead on arrival"", and was replaced by XAct. A few months later, when I was planning on my next ski trip, they wouldn't hold a charge, both of the units! I suppose the batteries died, on both both of them!. Called Customer Support, and was informed that the X2X is discountinued, and they don't support it anymore. It is a cheap toy, and it is what you get for such little money. At least is cheap; I'd be more upset if I had spend more money for it..."
3,Kids Love It but Buyer Beware,"Bought this item for a Christmas gift for my two girls, ages 8 and 9. We did not open or test the product before Christmas morning. Big mistake. One of the batteries was already dead. When we called the company to find out about getting a new battery, we were told we would have to purchase the new battery ($18.00) since we had purchased the product more than 30 days prior. The battery is only warrantied for 30 days. We were not happy about spending the extra money, but we did and now they work fine. The girls use it when riding their bicycles around the neighborhood and are never further than a block away so we can't really comment on the distance reliability."
2,Marginal Thumb Down,"In this Comedy Laura Dern plays a mom who is released on bail from her parents after going to jail for getting high on spray paint. She has four kids who she never see, much less knows who the dad is and is now pregnant again. When her family takes her in she tries to get high on her brothers model cement and is almost arrested. She is taken in by two pro-abortion activists (Swoosie Kurtz and Kelly Preston) and decides to get an abortion. But when the head of ""The Baby Savers"" comes (Burt Reynolds) she is offered $15,000 to have her baby. But when a man named Wolf, whop lives with the two pro-abortion activists says he will give her 15,00 for not having it, the choice is hers. This Movie gets a few cheap laughs but really lacks it plot and most of all, the acting, with the exception of laura dern's performance. That is not enough to do it, so I have to give this a marginal thumb down. END"
4,Needed a little work...,"It was what I was looking for in terms of content, however it was the short version...but it came with the answers written in it, luckily they were written in pencil, but I still had to erase every page."
1,next,You would be better off making three trades at ameritrade.com than spending $25.00 on this book. Worthless for an investor. Big dissapointment.
3,Disappointing but not worthless.,"I was expecting a very different book with more concise excerpts from the 25 books. There is way too little ""meat"" in this book for my taste, the author barely scratches the surface when he describes the content of these great books. If you dont own any of the 25 books already and are serious about investing, trading, speculating on the market this is a good place to start just to find out what investments books are out there.A better book that goes a little deeper is Market Wizards : Interviews With Top Traders by Jack D. Schwager."
4,Pretty Good,"""25 Investment Classics"" distills the knowledge of some classic investment books into bite-sized pieces. Gough explains the books involved, why the book in question is significant, and also offers his own critique of the investment classic under review. I did not give this book five stars because I disagreed with some of Gough's choices (I never thought of ""The Art of Short Selling"" as a classic). I was also disappointed by Gough's apparent contempt for technical analysis. Although there are plenty of concepts in technical analysis that are bogus, I do not think that the whole field is bunk. This is light reading for the lover of investing and trading books."
4,I've become the Fan,"God I love this! ""Fan and Bellows"" has been playing in my head for days...only love can save me now. I feel like a loser because there was a time in my life when I didn't own this cd. This is exciting!"
4,"Great, embrionic hints of the great music they would make","After listeninf to this band for 16 years, it was wonderful to find some cuts I hadn't heard. ""in Shreds"" is fantastic. Once again this is great , unknown music."
1,One Star because Zero is not an option,"The description says that it is compatible with the V400. It is not. The other side of the battery says its for the V300.It powered the phone but I could not call out and all in coming calls go to voice mail. As soon as I put the old (OE) battery back in, I was able place and receive calls immediately."
5,Great Referance,Great text book for executive coaches. I've always subscribed to the 'continuum' theory and here it is in black and white.
5,Best book on individual performance review,This books covers performance attributes in excellent definition and easy to understand examples. It is a bit overwhelming in its depth to measuring an individua's performance and identifying the means to grwo professionally.
4,Worth the money,"Although a little outdated, it's the more recent currently available. If you need something urgently, buy it. If you are just curious, wait a little for a revised edition. Independently, it is a good item and contains valuable information considering there aren't many publications like this one readily available."
1,Why?,"I swear this is the most objective and therefore impotent book on management and training that exists. I had a sales person lend this to me who had a boss that made them get it bc she was, I guess, a manager with ZERO management skills so she actually relied on this book. It is terrible. It reminds me of the kind of junk like the Oz Principle or one of those just corporate sterile and cold publications of the obvious. Do I need a book to tell me if I am not good at computers that I should work on getting better at computer? Seriously? How do these books sell?"
1,This is the book Apple tortures its employees with,I bought this in order to grovel at Apple's feet. Save yourself the trouble. This book is punishment. So bad
2,FYI: For your Improvement,I was required to buy this for a class.I didn't profit much from it and would not have purchased it on my own.
5,Liza at her Best,"Lovers of Broadway, Lovers of show business, and of course, Lovers of Liza - should consider this a ""must have"" in their collection. No doubt, this is Liza at her best - the perfect example of pure, raw entertainment talent. How can you live without it?"
1,The New York Dolls refused to play CBGB's,Yes but they are on this compalation. The New York Dolls are not punk and neither are the velvet underground. The new york dolls are a rock and roll band the velvet underground are a experimental rock and roll band. to call them punk is embarrising i think punk is the most overated thing ever. Like good music stop labling the New York Dolls never labled themselves punk and hated it pretty much hence the song lonon boys.
3,Kung-Fu Weirdness.,"Is this film a little bit strange? I'm not a fan of Kung-Fu films per se, but this must be among the most ridiculous ever made. First, great fighting, with brilliantly implausible sound effects, and funny cartoon-y characters as well. The main bad guy, though, will crease you up. For some reason he speaks and laughs like an old lady in distress. It makes the film impossible to take seriously. Also, the plot and the final twist are very well worked, so that the whole movie is like a guessing game for both the viewer and the good characters. It's not classic film-making at all, but for a non martial arts fan I liked it."
4,An epic martail arts piece!!,"Carter Wong is amazing as the invincible Tai Chi master. He wallops all his opponents, and as if that was not enough, he draws a symbol with his leg when fighting. Lo Lieh is his colleague and they are trying to wipe out a martial arts school led by Jack Long & Mark Long. The fight scenes were quite decent, but I did not like the way it ended. The good guys were by far no match for the bad guys. This is definitely a movie to keep for any wutang afficionado. Also check out Carter Wong in 18 bronzemen."
5,Another Classic From Joseph Kuo!,"Born Invincible is just one of those movies that you know is going to be interesting. The beginning of the movie is proof enough that you are truly in for a treat. The battle between the Hei-Pai killers and the school uncle is one of the most exciting demonstrations of weapon fighting since Master Killer.True fans will fall in love with Carter Wong's Tai-Chi style Kung-Fu. The near invincibility of the Taichi style leaves our heroes Mark and Jack Long in a seriuous quandry: Find his weakness, or die. Fortunately, The Taichi master has one glaring flaw in his technique.Can the heroes live long enough to exploit it? You'll have to buy the movie to find out. But I guarantee that you won't be disappointed."
3,This a kung-fu classic,"While i won't give it more than a three star rating , it's definitely a kung-fu classic , the stars in this martial arts adventure aren't as skillful as stars like Samo hung ,jackie chan , gordon lui chia hui, joesph kuo, Lo leih , john lui and the shaw brother cast, none the less this was a well executed story along the triditional ""i will get revenge for my master you bastard"" kung -fu stories.The action was great and i must say this is the best i have ever seen Carter wong (by now you should realize i am not a fan of his) for the true martial collector this is great piece to add to your collection , however i advise you to buy Fist of the white lotus and the invinsible amour , The kid with the golden arm and The magnificent ruffians, i am a collector these are a must have to your invincibility collection, laterz folks enjoy not getting cut laters."
1,Don't waste your money...,"My husband bought this pool for our 4 kids. We discovered what most other buyers did: this pool does NOT stay inflated. It was deflating as the kids were in it. We used it and inflated it as directed, but it still deflated. The whole thing was completely deflated overnight. The kids could not slide down the slide, as it was deflating as soon as we put the plug in. We are returning it. We bought another pool at another major retailer (W......) for $1 less and it is 100x better and has never lost air. Bottom line: do NOT waste your money on this pool. We tried it multiple times, in differing temperatures, and it would never stay inflated."
1,"Piece of Junk, waste of money!!!","I bought this pool thinking it looked like fun for my 1 & 5 year old. Little did I know the dumb thing won't stay inflated for more than an hour. I only owned this item for 1 week and it was used only twice. Each time I had to spend 30 minutes blowing it up with a pump, just for it to deflate over half way in only one hour. The kids didn't get to enjoy it because it would start to collapse and even the slide wouldn't stay tied to the pool itself. The attachment that has the basketball goal leans and ends up detaching after 5 minutes with or without a windy day. This product was made cheaply, even though for a blow up pool, it was one of the most expensive pools to select from. Don't waste your time or money!!!"
2,Totally misleeding!,"the box shows 2 BIGGER kids sitting in the pool and one going down the slide with room to spare...My son is almost 2...he and one other kid may fit in that pool, that's IT!!! The dementions say the pool is supposed to be 74 inches long 54 inches wide and 13.5 inches high. However blown up at best the outside measurements of the pool are 70 inches long, 51 inches wide and 10.5 high and that's being generous. There are 4 ring tosses in the picture, 2 on the actual pool. I called ToyRUs about it and was told by Jackie at the 800 number they don't list the size of the pool so it's not their problem. I wrote the manufactuer and have gotten ZERO responce! That being said my son has played in it a few times, though he has a hard time getting up on the slide because it moves around quite a bit he has fun with it. The pool is rated for kids older then 3 and frankly next year my son will be too big for this pool! With the shipping costs it wasn't worth the money!"
1,NOT PLEASED,I was not please with this item when we set it up the kids were too big for this pool it is for toddlers and not children over the age of 5years old. It was a waste of my money to have purchased this item.
1,Should have been taken off the market...or never put on!!!!,"ANY positive reviews had to be writen by marketers. The recommended age for this product is 3 to 12 but it is only big enough for a 1 to 3 year old. The less than sturdy slide takes up half of the maybe 4ft pool, so if my average sized 6yr old tried to slide his feet hit the edge before he can even splash. The slide surface itself is about two feet so you are done before you start. False advertisement doesn't begin to describe this atrocity. Banzai, Amazon and Toys R Us aught to be ashamed. PLEASE DON'T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY!!!"
1,Awful,I got this for my son that just turned 3. He is taller then the basketball hoop. With him laying down in the pool- he touches both sides. You could barely fit one kid in there. And the top part liens sideways. The slide doesn't stay put. Plus my son is bigger then the slide. This picture shows three kids in the pool and on on the slide and one climbing in on the slide- no way. I will prove it.Awful item.
1,I don't have received the item,I bought the item and I don't have received the item. I want to know what wasthe problem with the purchase.When I will receive the product.
1,Miniature pool,As every one else has said this pool is tiny maybe good for 1 or 2 toddlers. Picture on the front is NOT accurate. A 6 year old can't go down the slide with his legs out because they hit the wall. My 3 year old hardly fit. Buy a sprinkler for $5.00 my kids had more fun with that.
1,Awful... Banzai should be busted for false advertising,"This toy is terrible. The mechanics of it are weak. The slide is a total hazard and the only way to make it work is to tie it with the four cheesy pieces of rope they include with the toy. Honestly, it's one of the worst toys I have ever bought.ALSO - There is a disclaimer in the packaging telling the consumer they cannot return the product to the store... Complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,Disappointment,This pool is a waste of money. It is alot smaller that the picture on the box. It looked like the pool should be about 108-120 inches long. It does not have the pool dimensions anywhere on the box. It had a patch job already on it. Also you cannot return to the store you have the call the company. DO NOT BUY THIS POOL.
2,not so good for the kids.,"The pool is not O.K.,and the slide is not so good for the kids. All it has is one step that my kids can barrly get on. according to the pitcure the pool is suposed to be huge,right, but the slide really takes up almost the whole pool. The arch with the basketball hoop dose not stay sraight most of the time. I recomend to not buy this pool."
1,DANGEROUS POOL!,"We purchased this pool for our 3 year old. We immediately had to remove the slide - it is super dangerous... way to high and no landing room - the picture of the pool is NOT what it is like when you blow it up. With the slide in it there is only about 18"" of pool space. After removing the slide our son flopped down to splash in the water and one of the rings on the bottom that holds the slide cut his butt through a swimmer diaper - made a hole that would not stop bleeding and had a huge bruise around it. This pool should NOT BE SOLD. Not only is it mis-advertised it is dangerous. I bought it at Wal-Mart and I will be returning it. PARENTS BEWARE - DO NOT BUY THIS POOL!!!"
3,banzai wild waves water park,got this product for my grandkids the only thing that i could use was the pool itself the arched basketball hoop didnt stay inflated also the slide was very sticky when wet we put our own slide in it to give the kids some fun
1,Tears Very Easily..Ruins Pool,"I bought this last year and there are a couple things that need improvement: It takes forever to blow it all up and you need an inflating machine. Second, it is a small pool. Third, THE SLIDE POPS UP... IT WON'T STAY DOWN EVEN WITH TIES. THE TIES ALWAYS COME UNDONE. Fourth, One touch of a rock and the whole thing was done for with a hole in it that is impossible to patch. They really need to come up with a more durable bottom layer so that small rocks or sharp objects won't pop it. Despite my highest level of caution it got a hole in it after three uses. It is really really thin plastic on the bottom that makes it tear very easily. Despite only being used three times it was fun."
2,better in peices,The size of the poole is very misleading. but I did find a use for it (or part of it). if you seperate the sprinkler part of the pool and place it over a slip and slide it creates a neat tunnel for kids to slide under. otherwise I bought the pool about a year ago and have decided that it is more of a hastle to set up than it is worth. we have only used it half a dozen times at best. it is (as many others have mentioned) much smaller than you are lead to beive by the pictures
1,This toy ruined my life,Shortly after receiving this pool I started getting calls from family members wanting to come over and use the new fun park in my backyard. Myself and four other people entered the pool and had very little room to move around. The slide exploded when my father-in-law used it. My brother kicked my in the eyeball when he jumped in. He's always been an idiot though. The pool later started my house on fire.All in all a fun time but I'll never get my 6 square feet of lawn back the way it was.
1,What a waste!,I purchased this pool for my 3 year old son and was NOT happy. First of all the pool is so much smaller than the picture shown and secondly the slide is such a waste of space! For safety reasons you need the slide attached because there are 4 large plastic connectors for the slide to attach to. On the first day my son got a bruise on his side from the slide slightly moving and him falling on it. On the second day the slide popped. Not good quality and small. I do not recommend this pool!
1,Misrepresentation,"It shows 4 kids ages 5-7 on the box fitting in the pool comfortably. It even has the kids ""reviews"" of the pool stating their ages!!! No way my one 5 year old fits mostly the entire length of the pool himself. I could not believe what a false advertisement this was. We left it blown up and returned it to the store. At first the lady said ""Well you know all companies try to sell their products to make them look better"".Then my husband set the thing up onto the counter and all the cashier could d was laugh. It was ridiculous. This pool is appropriate for a very small toddler only!!"
1,What a rip-off,"Bought this pool at a local retail store. The box says it's 87x52x50. The actual pool measurements after inflated are: 57x36x12 deep. Nearly half of the 57 inch length is taken up by the slide. You can fill to about 10 in. I have never been so outraged by a products deception. This might be ok for one toddler or two but the box's picture is completely unrealistic.The measurements listed on the box are taken from the outside end of the ""slide"" and include the arch.My child is 8. How disappointing!"
1,Mad as Hell!,Most people are right about the misrepresentation of the picture and its size. It has been Photoshopped and it calls for mis-advertisement lawsuit. Amazon and Toys R US must take this product down until the product faces up and be truthful as to what it represent. It must state the dimension and it must say that picture is not proportionate. It is the worst product I'd ever bought from Toys R US and I'll never go to Six Flags! Don't buy it. Need a consumer advocate.
1,Only one day of fun,Please don't waste your money on this pool. I used a hand pump and it took forever to blow up. The bottom of the pool had to be pumped up daily because it leaks air. We attached to hose to the orange sprinkler section and after one day it ripped wide open and therefore the water sprinkler cannot be used. Might as well have bought a cheap plastic pool because that is all it is good for now. What a terrible product.
2,Much smaller than the box pictures,I bought this at the Toys R Us store. The box pictures large children playing in the pool area. The size of the pool is very deceiving. It is a small rectangular pool and the slide takes up half of the space in the pool. I have two preschoolers (ages 2 and 4) and this pool is just the right size for them. This pool is MUCH smaller than it looks on the box.
1,BEWARE: Deceiving!,"This pool is NOT as pictured. I bought it because it looked like so much fun but was afraid that it might be too big based on the picture on the box. I got the pool home only to find that the pool is much smaller than pictured. It is only about 5' long by 4' wide and the slide takes up more than half of the interior of the pool so there's no room to swim - even for my 3yr old! My suggestion, buy a regular 10x6 rectangular pool for the same price and use a Little Tikes slide at one end to let the kids slide in for fun, it's cheaper and more efficient..."
2,Don't buy it!,I should have listened to others...the pool does not hold air. The slide only held air the first time we used it and now it is worthless. The portion that has the basketball net does not stand up...so it is useless as well. My advice would be to find something else.
1,JUNK,For 40 bucks I thought I would at least get a pool that worked! Since day one the basket ball hoop will NOT stay up it is heavy on one side and tips over into the pool! I am so frustrated! And I can't return it either. (These pools are not allowed to be returned) I bought it at target.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!
1,Not Durable.,"Did not last more than 1 day. After a couple of hours in my backyard under the sun, two holes were created on the main pool and on the top part."
1,This pool stinks!,"This is the worse $42.00 I have spent in a long time. The picture is very misleading and the pool is very cheap and very small. It should say on the box, great for toddlers! I am taking ours back tomorrow. Save your time and energy. Buy a pool from a different company! I will never buy another item from Banzai!!"
1,DANGEROUS!!! DO NOT BUY,"Just bought this yesterday for my kids ages 3, 6, 7, and 9. Pool is super small, not what it looks like in their picture. Extremely hard to set up. I have an air pump that I usually use with setting up bigger blow up toys. The valves on this toy are regular mouth blow valves that didn't let me use the pump correctly. It took me an HOUR to set this stupid thing up with anxious kids waiting patiently. The slide is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!!! Even when 'tied' to the bottom of pool with the strings, they came untied with in seconds and it was so hard for my kids to try and balance to get to a sitting position. They usually fell off. The arch never stayed in place especially with the hose attached that added the extra weight. The basketball hoop is a joke. the ball doesn't even fit through. The whole pool base leaked through the valves and it deflated quickly.This is back in the box and getting returned today."
3,Ok for Pre-Schoolers,"Bought this for my three kids age 2-4. It is great for them and they love it. Tie-down of slide is poor, just four little ropes that are hard to attach. Like many have said, pool is small, though bigger than a kiddie pool. It is big enough to teach the four-year-old to swim, and I can sit in it with the three kids. I think it is too small for older kids though."
5,Excellent and very informative,"I found a lot of great information on crystals, gemstones, and charkas. It contains more information in one place for the healers than any book I have read so far."
2,"A nice book for beginners, but not very comprehensive","This book was actually sent to me by mistake. I ordered Stein's book on gem elixirs in order to pass it around during a workshop on the same topic.The book is very concise and easy-to-use. It does cover a couple hundred stones, including a couple that are less common. However, beyond that, the scope of the book is quite limited. Stein has a love for the healing properties of minerals, but this book just does not convey all of what it could."
1,hot stones,"the author forgot that lead crystal is useful for healing of hangovers...fill the crystal goblet with with the hair of the dog and, presto, no more hangover. and of course, putting a piece of granite over your friend's head will cure an achy toe, right after you drop the rock on his head...presto! achy toe forgotten! now, the most valuable one is so secret that I can't....well, just for all the nu wagers, rock hounds, crystal meth smokers and random wimdips....put a piece of rock salt (it is a crystal) under your tongue its guaranteed to do something....but I forget what!!!! AM SHANTY AM. (AM NOT!!!)"
2,dvd...invisible; cd works,"I've bought it for a great while but didn't have a chance to check it how this dvd works. I played it today, 01/16/12. What I saw was nothing. I thought something wrong with my cptr. I tried three more different movie dvds. Mine work fine. So, that dvd I bought didn't work on my cptr. The bonus music cd works though. That's bad, isn't it? I kept the dvd anyway but will not buy anything from Cal Pozo's dance series from now on."
3,At least I know Im not alone,"I've been a zoophile my whole life and constaintly asked myself ""Am I the only one?"" Reading this book gave me a sence that there are others like me out there. Honestly though I cannot compare my life to that of Mr. Matthews. After all, everybodys life is different. But the one thing I can connect with Mr. Matthews is the feeling of love and togetherness with an animal partner. I cannot say that this book was the best thing that I've ever read, but it gave me a lukewarm feeling that I'm not the only one out there who finds animals sexually attractive.In the meantime, I'll be waiting for the next book on Zoophilia that happens to hit the market."
5,Finally: Acceptance.,"I've lived all of my life attracted to other species, and during much of my adolescence, I would spend long hours alone at the zoo, just watching certain animals exhibit their gracefulness. I liked the monkeys especially, but it was so difficult to watch them in peace without being disturbed, since 'everyone loves monkeys'. Of course, I learned the full extent of that phrase in ""The Horseman,"" and I finally realized that my Zoophilic tendencies were not completely unusual. Thank you for creating such a wonderful book that celebrates sexuality of all types, even interspecial. I hope one day this novel may reach the the top of the best sellers list."
2,"Scarey book, somewhat not good for zoophile","Though this book does show some good things about zoophiles, I also find that it could damage some newbie zoophiles because it does make a bad impression that all zoophiles are large and have a lot of problems. I do not say Mark Matthews is a bad person, just I do not support his book."
1,"Nice idea, poor execution","I was glad to see the subject matter approached in a full-length book. However, it seemed poorly-written..like it was cobbled together from bits and pieces of random thought. All I got from it was that the author had a ""troubled past,"" and it seemingly related to women rejecting him and religious convictions leaving him. Hence, the book gives very little insight as to what makes people ""zoophiles,"" in my opinion. All we get is a depressing tale of a troubled man who starts out with a bad life..it gets even worse..then better again..then bad again..and I just had a hard time relating to his story. [F]or those seeking a true understanding of zoophilia, this book may confuse and frighten."
1,This will abolutely frighten people.,"This was a confused, cobbled together book exemplifying an individual whose past appears to have created a dysfunctional being. I am a former equine zoophile, and was in the process of ""coming out"" when my wife, a then niave individual, ""found"" this book by accident, read it to understand zoophilia more, and because of it, nearly terminated our marriage and destroyed the lives of our children. I owe at least two years of absolute living hell to Mark Matthews' book. My advice: be careful. It is certainly NOT representative of what zoophilia is about to most of those involved with it."
5,The Junk-Drawers Corner-Store Front-Porch Blues,I first discovered John R. Powers when a co-worker gave me the Unoriginal Sinner and the Ice God to read. It was so good I wanted to own that book and other books by Mr. Power. I was diappointed to find that all of his books are out of print. My local library had three of his tiles but have found it difficult to locate his works to purchase. I recommed all of John R. Powers books espesially to baby boomers his books will bring back wonderful memories. I would like to know more about the author.
1,Not happy,"We tried to buy this item under my wife's account. She could not remember her password and the sell was rejected. So, I opened another account in my name and bought this item. The next day her bank account was debited for the total amount. We ended up getting two orders. I called and the lady assured me that all I had to do was refuse the first one and we would not be charged shipping charges. BUT WE WERE!As I told the lady, if anyone can go into an account without knowing the password and buy something, then there is a real problem somewhere. Unless this is cleared up, we will not be buying anything else.Blessings, BJ Hudson"
3,Just ok for me.....,I'm not going to go into plot details the other reviewers have done that. The premise of this book sounded promising and funny but then it went off into realms I wasn't expecting so just didn't do it for me. Lauren has invented a synthetic blood that perfectly mimics the real thing. Kris is a bitter vampire who wants the formula so he can present it to the ruling counsel of vamps to make his case for the great vampire out of the closet day. What follows isn't the story I expected upon purchase but it wasn't totally horrid or anything just took me 4 days to get through it.
4,good book,"I liked this book alot! it was sexy, but it also had a good story which i really didn't expect. I bought it mostly just to get ideas for me and my fiances and found that it was really good. I wish it had more sex scenes in it, but it was actuslly very good I was suprised at how much i loved the story and i'm actually kind of happy that it had a story instead of just pure sex...i just wish it would've had a little more sex than it did not alot more but just a little."
3,I really wanted to like this...,"... THE NICKEL RIDE in particular. Years ago I acquired a film noir encyclopedia with listings from A to Z, and this film was among those listed. For that reason alone I've been wanting to see it, and now that I have I can say unequivocally that it's no great shakes. Too bad, because I like Jason Miller as an actor, and I think he deserved better. But the film has no bite, comes across more like a made-for-tv movie from that decade (the Seventies). As for 99 AND 44/100 % DEAD: Frankenheimer tries for a spoof of the crime genre and doesn't quite pull it off. The film is quirky, goofy, but not that funny, which I think was the intention. The cast is fairly interesting, with Richard Harris, Chuck Connors and Edmond O'Brien among those carrying this picture, Worth a glimpse perhaps for its novelty appeal, but not much else to be offered here."
1,The Worst Book Ever Written On Japan,"This book goes to prove the point that failures shouldn't write books about things they don't know much about because, obviously they failed at it. Mr. Chadwick has very little insight into Japan than any other English teacher whose worked there for a few months. It is full of stereotypes and dull to read, making hard to even believe that Mr. Chadwick has ever even been to Japan. Basically this is a scam to cheat you out of your money and destroy perfectly innocent trees. Read books written by the masters, and not the half-wit also-rans."
2,Just So-So,"The back & forth between years didn't work for me. I found it hard to get a feel for either his time or the other people in the monastery or his time visiting Japan w/his paramour. Overall mildly amusing, tame, and I'm left wondering what's the point of this? Mildly interesting if you knew Katagiri. A good read before bed, it'll definitely help you slow down from a busy day."
4,A triumph,"A interesting account of a American Zen Buddist in Japan. The memoir covers two different time periods in the author's life in Japan, and he jumps back and forth between them which I found confusing at times. The situations he finds himself in as he learns the culture are hilarious. If you are interested in Zen and the Japanese culture from an American perspective, get this book."
4,Nice but too old,"Great quality, cool and beautiful pictures, a great read too but you'll see that even the uniforms are different colored than the ones the the FFL wears now. Is a nice book but if what you're looking for is a document where you can see the contemporary FFL in all his glory, this is not what you should buy. I got it and I don't regret at all, it has a lot of history and also some chapters that are not so valuable. It makes a nice center piece for your table and the quality of the printing is as good as it could get many years ago."
3,Simple is true,The guide does provide good phrases for most situations and does come in useful when writing appraisals. There are better guides out there so one has to remember you get what you pay for.
1,Not what I expected,"I would not buy this book, as it is really a waste of money. It is to abreviated and useless. there are much better choices out there."
3,"By Way of Deception is much, much better","I did not mind this book, it just failed to really grab my interest. So I wrote a small review to really encourage people to read his first book, 'By Way of Deception'. That is a fascinating non-fictional account of the extremely important Israeli Mossad, as told by an ex-agent.'The Other Side of Deception' is also enlightening and well written though it contains a few weak spots in my opinion."
3,Know your application,"For examples and perhaps a bit more explaination as well as practice exams, it's great, but if your working in the field, buy the guide."
2,Relaxation & Mood music?,"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the music on this CD. I have heard a number of pieces designed for relaxation and meditation, and felt the music on this CD did not meet these needs. The music on the first track was too pulsating (sounded like someone trying to start a small motor repeatedly) to be very relaxing. The meditation music was interesting, but was a bit fast to keep it from being overwhelming. I would not recommend this CD for use other than background noise."
3,"Good, but...","The premise of this book was pretty good and it was fairly well written. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half, but lost interest during the second half. There were too many inconsistencies with Biblical Christianity and what the characters portrayed... It seemed to me to have more Mormon undertones (which is fine if that is your belief, but if looking for a more Bible-based book, this is not really what you are looking for)."
3,Not My Favorite,"I am not the type of person who cares much for looks or beauty contest so when I read this, I found out it wasn't my kind of book. It was an easy reading so since i had to read it for school I was glad that it didn't take long. For those who like beauty contest, it's probably for you."
4,"If you like reading exciting pageant books, this is for you.",This is about a young girl named Scottie Ann and her beauty queen sister. Her sister is a beauty queen while Scottie Ann is not. Her sister enters her in a beauty contest in her school. Read the book to find out what happens next.I think the story was sort of exciting. I would say it was an ok book.
3,"Wish I had an ""L""","Having that wide of a zoom range is certainly awesome, but the optics on this camera are very dissapointing. I frequently would have to bump up my aperature and sharpen in my computer to try to get more focus, becuase this lens has major problems with fuzziness and crispness in all situations. My basic canon lens 28-90 has much clearer pictures and even those need sharpening.Overall, I love how light and compact the lens is and the range I can cover with it, but I think I am sacrificing a lot for a lower price and smaller size."
4,Convenient value,"I've used this lens for the last 8 months on my Pentax K100D and find it to be a great value. Is it soft? Slightly, when viewed at full size (NOT full screen, but 100% resolution), or when printed at poster size. Does it have purple fringing? Maybe slightly on high contrast shots, but then so do some of my other supposedly better lenses. The colors and contrast are fine and the bokeh is pretty good. All the negatives of my copy of this lens just don't show up in the way I use the shots (viewed full screen, or printed 8x10). The only photo contest I've ever won was with a print taken by this lens, so it's certainly a capable lens.I'll say that I paid well less than what's advertised here, so that has certainly biased my judgement. If I paid close to $400, I may choose other lenses, such as the 18-250 version, but the range is very convenient."
5,"AMAZING BOOK! Great continuation to CS Lewis ""Screwtape Letters""","Worth every penny!I enjoyed reading Jim Forest's book. It is interesting and educating.I liked how every chapter in the book brought something new to explore.Jim Forest described different passions and different versions of those same old temptations that have new ""facade"" these days. Also, the book is talking about virtues that help Christians to fight devil. There are different ways to overcome temptations and this book might help people to recognize them. Very recommended!"
4,Printmaster is a great addition to my digital library of programs,"I've owned almost every edition of Printmaster and upgrade every few years. It's great and reasonably priced. However, go straight to the Broderbund site and buy the latest for $29.95 rather than spend a fortune on an old edition."
4,Burn Fat & Get Fit - video,Excellent exercise tape. Keeps you motivated. Susan explains what is going on and keeps reminding you to go at your own pace. I use this tape often.
3,"I really wanted to like this video, but...","I work out with exercise videos a minimum of 5 days/week and was looking to add another tape to the mix. One workout with this video was enough to know it wasn't for me. The aerobic segments are extremely repetitive. Not only is this boring, but you are working the same muscle groups over and over. The toning segments are good and compensate somewhat for the repetitive nature of the aerobics, although it wasn't enough to keep me interested in the workout as a whole. I was also annoyed and distracted by Susan constantly breaking out of her routine to either praise or correct the form of the other two participants. I much prefer the leader to LEAD by doing the workout with proper form and verbally offering corrections and suggestions. I would not recommend this video--there are much better options for beginner/intermediate level exercisers."
4,"Never boring, liked this video..","I've been exercising (strength and aerobic) with exercise videos for about 6 months now and would highly recommend this tape for anyone, either just starting out or at my own level. Susan modifies throughout the tape, showing beginners how to perform the exercise. I love the way Susan stresses the importance of ""form"" throughout the workout, because exercising form is many times neglected in some of the other videos I've seen.The blending of cardio and strength training (one minute strength, 3 minute cardio) makes the time fly, you're never bored and work up a good sweat. The only negative aspect of this video was what another reviewer commented on -- the camera angle will focus in on Susan's face and shoulders when I would like to see the exercise being performed."
3,Susan Powter: Burn Fat & Get Fit,"Although, this video was ok (had I had a step, it would have been better), without the step it was TOO beginner. I consider myself a beginner, but it was no challenge without the step. Susan Powter was a little rough. It seemed like she was intiminating to Sally and Eric, the two that were working out with her. To me, she was acting too much like a drill seargent in this video. (I was in the military, so I know what I am talking about). I will still do the workout. I'll just shut the sound off and play some different music in the background when I do it. It also seemed like she watched Kathy Smith's step-aerobics tape from 1992 before she did her video, because there was a lot of simularities between what Kathy did and what Susan does with the moves and the advise. It is TOO SIMULAR!! (except Kathy Smith is nice)."
2,Boring,"I'm an intermediate to advanced excersiser and I borrowed this video from the library for variety. I was disappointed. Susan says that the video is for all fitness levels, but I barely broke a sweat. I was so bored because the moves rarely changed. There was only one ab exercise which didn't target the obliques or lower abdomen and if she said ""Oxygen"" one more time, I planned on screaming. She didn't even do most of the workout. She spent most of the time talking to her flunkies. I don't recommend this video. If beginners are looking for a step and toning video, try some of Kathy Smith's workouts."
4,Great for Susan Fans!,"This video is excellent for someone who has been exercising already and loves Susan Powter. I have her ""Give Me 5"" program and love her Move It and Lose It video. This video is great because you can get a bit of a rest from the cardo while doing the strength training, while always staying within your fitness level. I found it difficult to do the middle level because for the majority of time they all followed the ""double time"" routine. Overall, this is a great video for all of us Susan Powter fans."
5,Great History,"I have loved reading this book. It is about a man who follows Joseph Smith and became his personal body guard. It shows their friendship over the years and how hard it was to live back then. It is great and sad too. I love it. It is a great part of history to read.The only thing I don't like is all the extra pages the author leaves in between the chapters, what was he thinking???"
2,Lousy Writing,"I was very interested in learning more about Porter Rockwell by reading a fictionalized biography, but as other reviewers have said, the writing is terrible. It is so bad that I never even got halfway through the book. I am afraid that although this writer is a historian, his skills with writing and dialogue leave a lot to be desired."
2,Poorly written,"i was excited to read this book because I wanted to learn more about Porter Rockwell, but did not make it past the second chapter. The writing was so poor I didn't think it was worth my time to continue reading. I wish I could at least say that it was a pretty good read, but it's not even marginally good enough to recommend.Annie"
5,Great for CCD or home study!,"This is a great book, written for children but totally straightforward and interesting. It answers lots of questions that we all have about religion, and it is a great resource for CCD teachers. I very much enjoy reading this book to my children, especially since they do not have access to the Catholic school education that I enjoyed."
3,BALTIMORE CATECHISM,"I GREW UP IN THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOL SYSTEM OF DETROIT. WE LEARNED FROM THE BALTIMORE CATECHISM DURING MY GRADE SCHOOL YEARS. I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A CARBON COPY OF THAT WHICH I USED IN THE 1950""S. IT IS NOT QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED."
4,Not An Antique,"If you're hoping this is the book you used in Catholic Grammar school, it's not. It is probably exactly the same as the one you used in 1964 but it been republished in 2008. In other words, this isn't an antique."
3,Not BlackHappy,The only thing I can really say about this album is it is not black happy. After Friendly Dog salad Black Happy's music started to move away from the happier style towards peghead. This album is kinda harsh and a little experimental. It is worth buying and listening to but if you are looking for more black happy you will only be midly satisfied.
5,American Legend at her BEST!!!,"As a longtime fan, I wasn't disappointed in this offering of the one season Judy Garland Show on CBS. This national treasure and American icon dazzles you with her unwavering musical talent and charisma. Pioneer Artists have done a remarkable job in executing and restoring this variety series to the best audio-video standards for everyone to enjoy again and again. Don't delay any further and build up your own personal collection of this great performer in her prime while still avaiable to own. Though captured in black and white, it would have been glorious to have been produced in color is the only exception to this outstanding short lived series."
5,"Judy is spectacular, but I'm writing for Robert Cole","In the concert section of this DVD, there are three songs performed by the Robert Cole Trio. As far as I know, this is the only way you can hear this amazing jazz voice, no other recordings available that I am aware of. My, who is he? Amazing.Judy? It is Judy at her best. I often listen to these performances without the video, and they are great. But if you watch her sing, you will realize that she, unlike most singers, becomes totally lost in her songs. She is THERE."
4,Good effort on a colorless character,"Alexander captures Hornsby and his times perfectly. While not as readable as the author's previous ""Ty Cobb"", this is due more to Hornsby's general colorlessness than in Alexander's writing. As enigmatic as Hornsby was, Alexander does a great job in telling the life of the man who hit for the highest average in the 20th century."
5,Last chance to get the baby one more time mixes!,"This is one of my favorite Britney Spears' CDs! The Sometimes radio edit is a little shorter than the album version-- still good, though. The second track is Baby One More Time Sharp Platinum Vocal Mix. This song is very similar to the Sharp Trade Dub version. It's 8 minutes long! If you like high bass sounds and the words hit me baby one more time repeated lots of times then you'll love this song! And then there's the club mix version of baby one more time -remixed by Davidson Ospina. This song is also very similar to the Radio Mix version. Both of these songs were found on the baby one more time single but is currently not available anymore- so this is your last chance to get them! Buy this CD and you wont regret it!"
5,Efficacious Techniques for Christian Prayer,I give this book a very high rating due to the fact that Watchmen Nee provides us with so much useful information to help us in our daily walk with Christ. 'Let Us Pray' makes the basics of prayer available to us so that we may come to God with effective and fervent prayer. Watchman Nee expresses the importance of knowing what we Christians have to deal with daily so we may conquer the opposition and allow Gods will to prevail on earth. This book is essential for anyone who calls himself a follower of Christ ; it is also rewarding to anyone who wishes to sharpen their effectiveness in the dimension of prayer.
5,Pray Without Ceasing,Very powerful book! It really brings home the necessityof prayer in one's life. We cannot do without it!
5,this is awesome,"the is a very book i ever own , and i also have box of his books too (now),and i found few related web site of his books www.lsm.org"
1,Did not agree with the premise the book is based on,"I am generally a fan of Nee's writings, but this one left me quite cold. His claim is that God does not act unless a person prays. I do not agree that this is the nature of God. I think God can and does act independent of man, but responds to man's prayers too. I think He likes us to pray so that when it does happen, we know it was Him who did it and that we thank Him, but I cannot agree that God needs man to pray else His hands are tied."
2,Let us pray,It was repeditive and a bit complicated. Did not flow of get my interest past the first 10 pages.
2,Where are the pages?,"I got this used workbook and in the description, it said that the book had some notes and was highlighted, but was fine to use. So I bought it. It arrived fairly fast, but there were some problems with the workbook; it was missing pages. I wish they would have told me that there were some pages missing so that I could have just bought the more expensive one. I did not like how misleading this product description was."
1,Never Received Product,"I ordered a text book and 20 days (and 3 failed quizes later) later I looked around on the internet to find out how to contact the seller because I never received the book. It turns out that it is a company in Canada. I sent a scathing e-mail to three different addresses that I found because I read that other people had issues with contacting this company (the one to customer service bounced back). In no time someone replied, but with no specifics. I sent another e-mail and then the reply was one telling me that they could not send the book and they will process a refund. I strongly suggest that you do not order from this company. When you order anything, check it the provider, put it on your credit card so you are prepared to dispute the charge if necessary, and buy American. I guess it is a hassle getting things accross the border."
4,Bravo - Bravo for TJ Dupree,"TJ captured the innocence of a child's humor, inquisitive heart and spirit. Conversations with Mom warms your heart and as TJ mentions will bring found memories of your own experiences. I am anxiously awaiting volume 2."
5,A Must Read!!!,"This book will have you looking for more stories after you have read the last one(hint, maybe a part 2). They are laugh out loud funny, and touching.Read it and tell a friend. They will thank you for it later."
1,Goldmine of misinformation,"The 'Book of Calendars' is known among those who study calendars to be an embarassment. The tables are replete with calculation errors and typos. Calculated dates often bear no discernible relation to the background text. The narrative text is also misleading, and filled with partial material. Often, it is simply wrong.Virtually the only feature of value is the lofty goal. Such a book, if it contained accurate information, would be a rich resource. Sadly, this text does not even come close. I am frankly puzzled that a publisher would even bother to re-print this work, given its very poor reputation."
1,Do not buy this book!,This book is best avoided because of the embarassingly largenumbers of errors. None of the tables is to be trusted; the textual material is also unreliable.The book is well-known among the calendarist community as a disaster. It is a pity that it has been reissued.
1,I'm the one who used to post this books errors,"I agree its is pitiful, and i also say it WOULD BE valuable. I did educate myself with this book. I have a mind able to correctly see other's errors and even how people made their errors. My copy has a cross-out and correction for every error in this book. I wish a publisher would help me get it on a press in a single week. If you wish to know the level of my thoughts (religiously) the Chinese calendar was created in Ur when Peleg Mesanipada Huang Di set his son up to rule everyone in his city. His son is Aanipada Reu who is Yu The Great. The first 60 years belongs to Reu, Peleg was 62 not 60 when he made his son king in 2207bc (not the backward calc 2209bc, nor Chinese forward calc 2205bc) and this calendar was 360-day for 180 years before changing in 2029bc and finalized in 1437bc."
3,The jury's out on this one...,"I found this video to be slightly on the sloppy side... Sloppy playing, sloppy sound, sloppy camera work... Maybe that fits a band like Molly Hatchet but I don't like watching videos like that. If you're a fan of MH, I'm sure you'll enjoy this."
2,A big disappointment over their earlier insole of the same name,"For years, I used Athletes Plus insoles happily to support my sensitive feet. They worked like a charm.Now they have ""upgraded"" them with a new shape, new materials, etc. and they provide so much less support that I now have to search for other insoles.Look elsewhere."
2,its ok but watch out,i bought this from a sports shop. its ok. fit to my shoes. i used for basketball shoses. the problem was that it was melted soft gel by heat.
5,solid,These don't over pronate or what ever other insoles do to make your feet hurt. Nice and thick. Little to heavy to run with but great for hiking in a boot.
2,Make no difference to me,"It fits fine. But I don't think it make a huge different. I meant to put them in my althletic shoes, so i took out the original insole and change to these. I even compared with one shoe with it one with the old insole. But I can hardly feel any difference. I don't know how it is after a long run comparing to ordinary insole, but for the hight price, to me it's not worthwhile."
5,I love this football,"This is one of the best footballs I've ever owned. I love the grip. You have to try to drop this ball. Also the ""soft touch"" isn't bad either. This rivals many other more expensive leather balls and for a composite, it's great. I would definitely recommend this ball to anybody unless your a pro football player."
2,Not Full Grain,"This ball is not a ""Full Grain"" leather football. It is a composite that retails between $40 and $50 not $121 as stated. The price is probably worse than what you would find at your local sporting goods store. I did buy and return this ball for a full refund, a bit of a hassle but got all my money back."
3,Not very good,"These walkie-talkies have very poor sound and not much range. They are very cheaply made, and look like poorly constructed toys when you see them in person. I do not recommed them at all."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought these for my two daughters (ages 4 & 5). The girls were VERY excited about playing with these, but they simply do not work. You can barely hear anything through the walkie-talkie and you can only be a few feet apart and directly in line of sight of each other to hear anything through them. The kids could hear each other talking better than coming from the walkie-talkies!I would highly recommend NOT getting these!!!! We have also tried the Disney Princess wristband / ear clip version will equal success. Very frustrating! Guess we need to buy real walkie-talkies to get something to work!"
5,Feliway keeps the peace,"When we added a new cat to our existing clan of 3 it caused some acting up in the group. After all of the recommended processes to introduce the new cat failed we tried Feliway, It really helps them to remain calm and stopped the marking of territory and 'cat fights' that we were experiencing."
5,FANTASTIC STUFF,"Whether it is 2 cats or 9 cats I have found this product works with GREAT results. I don't know how, but it works. In fact within two days the petty fights stopped, those little kitty skuffles that just keep all on edge. All cats are happier, and more tolerant. The only thing is that they ONLY LAST 30 Days and believe you me once you have started using it you will not go back. If they made a 45 day or 60 day product it would be better. I recommend it to all my cat friends and they find the cost is so worth it. You will know it when your product needs replacing - cat behaviour changes."
5,Works very well!,"The plug-in diffuser helps prevent my two cats from anxious scratching. In addition, the one who used to be quite shy, is a lot friendlier."
1,They did not work for my cats,"I bought these with high hopes that my cats, that are brothers, would stop fighting. Seems that boys will be boys, and these plug-ins did not affect them at all. They did not change the behavior of my alpha cat. Oh well, it was worth a try I suppose...."
4,useful for cat owners,"I have five cats and definitely agree that this product is very useful and works well. The time in which this product lasts is the only complaint that I would have about this product. It only lasts around a month and a half. Price range, it would be a bit above my budget but it is still worth it. Will keep purchasing this product and using Amazon."
4,"So far, so good","I've been using these for a few months now at my vet's suggestion.So far, my cat has stopped over-grooming her fur and has generally mellowed out. We had a period where she was continuing to mark spots around the house with urine, but between the Feliway and treating her for a mild UTI, that too has passed.I didn't believe much in this when my vet recommended it a year ago, but I'm glad I finally tried it...it DOES work!"
3,Cat Magic,"The vet recommended using the Feliway pheromone product as a way to calm two spatting cats. The 6-pack price is terrific! Does it work? Hmmm, you have to believe in something, and they are a little less antagonistic to each other these days."
2,Doesn't work,This was recommended by my vet for my cats anxiety & nervousness. It hasn't changed her one bit after 4 months of use. Going to finish up what I bought because it is so expensive but not reorder.
2,Feliway Not Working,"I decided to try this product, hoping it would stop a neutered male cat from marking on my sunporch. A vet recommended it.It has NOT worked for this problem with this cat."
3,Feliway,I'm still working with this product to help my cat behave better around strangers. The six-pack is the most economical.
5,Happy Cats.,This stuff is great. Keeps the cats fron suffering from strees generated by visiting pets and people. Stopped the one cat from marking the house and suffering from blocked urinary issues.
4,"works great, helps calm the cats","Works great, really does help calm the cats. Have used it in past too. Only problem is if aren't in the same room as the diffuser...that's where the collars help too"
2,"It hasn't stopped our cat from Urinating, so don't purchase it for that!","After reading the manufacturers directions to use for 30 days to see results, we purchased about $85 of this stuff to cover a 2500 sq. ft home for 2 months. We are now going into the 6th week with NO positive results. It was like taking $85 cash and throwing it right in the garbage."
3,Relief for Stressed Cats,"Although my cat is on medicine for her stress, I purchased the feliway's on the recommendation of my vet. I am not sure which helped--the med or the feliway. At any rate, the only ""con"" with the feliways is that the plastic seems to burn when the liquid is very low. Currently, I am trying just the med to see if that works without the plug-ins. There isn't any odor to the feliway, which is a bonus."
4,It works,"No doubt this product works well, but it doesn't last as long as. I've seen the bottles run out in a little over two weeks. I have two cats at the house at any one time, and one of them was urinating on the carpet near the bathroom where the litterbox is, and also right next to the litterbox itself instead of in it! It was so frustrating. But my long absences from home at times cause this stress upon him. After using this product, he no longer urinated in those areas, and they both got along much better during the times that I would be gone. Overall it's a good buy and well worth it."
4,Good,"I used this extensively when I was sponsoring a rescue cat that was out of control. He would run around the house all night. Terrorize my own cats and was, in generally, a crazy kitty. I hear of this product and was delighted with the results. While his behaviors were cut easily in half, more importantly, my own to kitties were less traumatized by his antics. Once it is plugged in my own kitties gravitate to it like catnip and are less worried about the neurotic kitty who is walking around."
3,"It didn't work miracles, but-","My dear neurotic cat has been licking and sucking the hair off her tummy and legs since she was a kitten. She is a high strung Ocicat who also scratches herself perpetually. She is now 13 yrs. old. I tried Feliway Plug-ins 4 mos. ago and they noticeably quieted her down after the first 1-2 weeks. They did not stop her OCD behavior, but it improved a little and I am very happy this elder cat seems more at peace with herself. That's why I stocked up on the 6 mos. pack at a much more reasonable bulk pricing."
5,Feliway Plug-In Refills,"Received shippment quickly.Love the phermone. My cats are happier, more loving & not as skiddish.Great price compared to Petsmart."
1,Expensive and Ineffective!,"Unfortunately this product did nothing for my 5 cats who are still fussing with each other. I've tried 2 plugins going simultaneously, 1 on each floor of my house in open areas several times over the course of 2 years.... so there's been plenty of time for it to work. These cats are siblings who were raised together. I don't understand why the 2 females are still territorial, spraying wherever they want, and hissing at each other. hey were all neutered at 6 months, they all come and go through their cat door. Other people seem to have success with this product, but not us."
4,Really seems to work,"Really seems to work. My cats don't get along so well and fight occasionally, but since using Feliway they get along much better. Not buddies you understand, but relaxed."
5,Feliway,This is really good for skittish cats. My mother has a cat with a temperament and this helps keep her calm. Price was right and received it quickly.
1,Major problem here,"Noticed that my cat was no longer responding to the Felway after I cracked open one of these bottles. So tonight I looked at it, and none of it was missing after several days. I unplugged it and noticed that it was dangerously hot. And the upper most part of the wick was dry. I then inspected the empty box that I saved. And it was in a foreign language.For now, I poured the Feliway into one of my old empty bottles, since my kitty would have none otherwise. And needs it.Not sure what to do. Is the diffuser not meant for foreign feliway bottles? Are the wicks defective?"
3,received comfort zone not Feliway refills,"I am assured that Comfort Zone is the retail version of Feliway but the bottles are different shapes and I had ordered Feliway because that is what I wanted, not a substitute."
2,Tom Cat Smells,It kind of works but it is not oderless. I have to keep a window open next to where the cat is. Kind of defeats the purpose.
1,FEliway was a waste of money,I plugged in 5 Feliway diffuser to try to help with my cats' behavior. I used them for two months and they had NO effect at all. Waste of money.
1,Not working,Feliway was recommended to me by my vet to make my multiple cat household a little less stressed and stop one of my males from spraying. Even after having spend a lot of money on 5 diffusers and numerous refills it has not changed the behavior of any of the cats. My male actually sprayed right where I had one of the diffusers plugged in... I can't recommend it since it didn't have any positive impact on my cats and I feel like I wasted my money.
1,Waste of money,"I have three cats in the house, to prevent one cat from attacking the other two we bought this product. Unfortunately it has had no effect."
3,Great product but the diffuser is not so good,"The product itself seemed to work to calm down my cats during our major house renovations and the house is for sale so strangers are coming through the house. I love the product. The problem is with the diffuser. It left a slight greasy mark on the paint on the two walls where I had put in the plug ins. So I returned them and bought the spray bottle instead. If they make the diffuser aim the product AWAY from the wall, then this will be a great investment."
5,This stuff works,"I moved into a new house and our cat started spraying on vertical surfaces, walls, cardboard boxes, etc. I purchased two of these and one refill. I plugged one in upstairs and one downstairs. Suddenly the cat stopped spraying and was much more calm with the new environment. About a month later the cat started spraying again. I noticed the bottles were empty. I reordered this 6 pack and problem was solved. Tough thing is we will need to keep buying these but it better than putting the cat down."
5,Felliway,This product is exactly like the one I bought at my vet's for about half the price. It keeps my nervous nelly cat calm & seems to have improved his appetite
3,Good product,"Our kitten tends to be nervous and this product appears to help her. We are not 100% sure as to it's benefits however want to do all possible to help her feel happy, comfortable and well so continue to have one plugged in at all times. The 6 pack is more economical and convenient."
5,outstanding,Great product and great shipperKitty is must happier now that this product is working in the house. I will be ordering more as soon as I am done with these.
2,Great idea...terrible product.,"I purchased these refills to go with the two diffusers I bought (I've reviewed those as well!). Not only did they not work, I actually think they worsened the problem of my cats urinating in the rooms they had been placed in. Maybe these do a little too good a job of ""relaxing"" our feline friends!"
2,Feliway 48-Milliter Plug in Refills,Using it so far for 6 weeks and see very little change in our house of cats spraying around the house..
4,works great but stem dries out very fast.. Have bought a few defusiers.,It works great for my cat. But the thing dries out so fast. I have to take the bottle and turn it over for a few days then put it back when the stem is very moist. Does anyone else have that problem?
5,Felliway -- For Neurotic Cats -- It Works!,"My otherwise extremely sweet and mellow Maine Coon cat started freaking out a bit (biting). After reading and asking questions on my Maine Coon listserv, I got the Felliway diffuser. It's great. No more biting -- my cat is back to his sweet, mellow self."
5,Very Helpful,"We use FeliWay to help keep my cat calm. He is super attached to me and is needy. The FeliWay helps calm him and makes him not act as crazy, because I can tell as soon as a refill runs out, he goes all nuts again!"
3,Trying to calm kitties,"I first bought the diffusers for every room in the house on the recommendation of my vet. I have been using the product for 2 months and have not noticed any behavioral changes. I am told I need to be patient and give the product a least 90 days, so I have just ordered another supply. The price from Amazon was far less than the vet and considerably cheaper than the locate pet store. I am also trying other holistic methods to try to calm the cats, but still a stressful house with a lot of cat fighting."
5,Helps keep multiple cats civil and well,"I domesticated a litter of feral kittens and now have 4 six-year-old cats. One of the two males came down with urinary crystals and after much veterinary help he got over them. During the recovery I implemented the use of Feliway and also I added a couple of water fountain drinking bowls in addition to their water bowls in several locations.Three years later, I had let the Feliway run out and thought all was well in the house when the two boys had a couple of rough and tumble fights. I put the Feliway back into the house and since then there have been no further squabbles. I placed it in a location that is central and out of the draft of doors and open windows.I think it is a good addition to keep multiples friendlier and also to help keep them less nervous during stress times.Sometimes it takes layers of therapy to keep animals at their best - food, water, environment all make a difference and this seems to help."
4,Could not live without it,"My orange tabby was marking every single piece of furniture in her room. I had tried every enzimatic cleaner to no avail. After the first week using the Feliway diffuser, she was calmer and stopped marking. I stopped using it for a while, and the markings came back. So - we are back using Feliway. It is a little expensive, but worth it."
4,Cat Stress,"While I don't understand why, this product does seem to calm my cat and he is much friendlier"
2,No difference for my home,"I have a multi-cat home. I bought this to try to ""mellow"" aggressive behavior in a couple of my cats. I can see no difference. Also, the one scaredy-cat is no less fearful. I have put these in various rooms in the house where the cats live."
4,Helped my little stressed kitty,My cat stresses so much that he loses hair. And Feliway has helped him regrow his hair. I stopped it once and his hair loss returned. So I keep using it continually and it seems to help.
5,Very Effective,"I have been using this product for over six months now, and my cat has responded 100%. She no longer sprays and I am thrilled."
5,Works great!,I have been using this for several years. I think it keeps our two cats calm. Be careful to not have anything blocking the diffuser or it can leave a residue on the wall.
4,Feliway,Feliway works great for shy kittys. It also helped keep the peace between my original kittys and a new kitten. I would recommend this product.
5,It really works,"Our five cats got along until my husband rescued a sick and close to death kitten in October. After isolating him for several weeks while he got well, I gradually introduced the kitten to the rest of them....using all the recommended methods for introducing new cats. It didn't work. They just couldn't get used to him; he was much too aggressively playful for them. At the suggestion of our vet I tried Feliway. The change was quick and remarkable. Fights are not happening as much, less yowling, no more urinating outside the litter boxes. It still isn't 100% loveland, but they are starting to play together, sleep together and groom each other. I use both the diffuser and the spray."
5,Feliway Difuser Refill,"We have used this product in our three cat home for almost two years. The difference is fantastic. Before we started using the Feliway synthetic pheromone, our cats fought pretty ferociously. None were ever actually injured, but it was a very real concern. Within a few weeks of starting to use the Feliway synthetic pheromone in two diffusers (each diffuser covers a maximum area of about 750 square feet), our cats settled down dramatically. Not that they are suddenly best of friends, but the fighting has almost disappeared and when they do fight, the viciousness of their fight is greatly reduced. We will not be without this product as long as we have cats."
5,Feliway Comfort Zone works,"We have 5 male cats (neutered, of course) who are mostly snuggly with their people servants, but not much with one another. The newest to the tribe is BooBoo, an almost feral young cat who is learning how to be social. I can always tell when one of the diffusers needs changing, because there is an increase in snarling and screaming from the cats. Within an hour or so of changing the empty bottle for a new one, calm (such as it is) returns to the manor."
4,Can't Live Without!,"Our ""emo-cat"" is so chill when we have the Feliway. It's great. He's usually uptight, and high strung, but when the Feliway is plugged in, after a couple of hours he's calm, and playful. He's not whiney and overly loud (as Maine Coon's can be). He is often found nearest the outlet just chilling out after we get home. I think he appreciates it as much as we do. I recommend it for someone (anyone) with a skittish, high strung cat."
1,Not convinced,"I have four older cats (all spayed and neutered as kittens), which we've moved with multiple times. Every time we move, spraying ensues. Inevitably, we get desperate, and buy these things (cause cat piss sucks and you'll try anything to make it stop). I have never seen any evidence that these help. I realize I'm going against the grain here, with hundreds of positive reviews, but I stand by my extensive experience with these things. I understand why people want them to work (man do I want them to work!), but they just didn't for me.That being said, if I were you, and my cat was pissing on my stuff, I'd take a shot at these. I just thought someone should be the grain of salt."
4,Lives up to it's repu,"As a typical consumer skeptic, like anything that seems too good to be to be true, I was a little hesitant to try this out. One of my two cats had been licking his belly raw during the winter months. Two vets later and bills piling up I decided to try this in combination with another shot at antibiotics as well as more play time and it worked ... finally.The healing didn't happen over night or anything but I could see the cats immediately respond to it and it definitely took the edge off. He is now healed up and while he still occasionally licks [a little de-furred still] I at least know it's a mental thing that can be addressed and no longer a possible serious medical issue.Only bad part is that each vial lasts only about 3.5 weeks!"
1,Actually increased cat spraying,"Plug it in and the cat backs into it and SPRAYS THE THING. Wasted $45.00 on this product at Petsmart. Actually increased the spraying of the male cat I adopted from then shelter. Kitty is a fixed males -- been fixed since early kittenhood -- 4 years old now, age of adoption.My 3 grand worth of new carpet can testify. The whole house is a mess. The vet has recommended Buspar pills and/or tranqs. Was hoping to avoid that, but either we try a pill- it works -- or we haev to sadly return him to shelter. Maybe that was why he was in the shelter to begin with, poor guy. We are crushed."
3,Faliway Electric Diffuser,"I am hoping it works though I can't tell right now. The cat I am using it for is new to me, old, deaf and screams, not meowing so right now I can't say it is working or not. Good comments from friends who have used it."
4,Keeps the cat's bad habits away,"I use these plug-ins in conjunction with the pheromone collar and it appears to keep the cat's bad habits away. He howls sometimes at night, marks often in specific places around the house and sharpens his claws on the carpet instead of his post. These plug-ins help keep the pheromone in the air after his collar has worn off. No substantial change in behavior other than very sparse howling and marking seems to have stopped. Buying these keeps me from steam cleaning his ""spots"" every weekend"
3,I guess it works?,"I'm kind of septical if this even works. We still have cat bathroom issues from time to time. The best way to buy the Feliway is in the bulk packs. Never buy them from you vet, it's a total rip off."
3,Not sure enough...,Not sure enough... I'm doing my own test right now and not sure to re-buy it. Not convinced at all.
3,But does it work?,"Having used the Feliway diffuser periodically, I honestly can't tell whether it makes any difference at all to my cats' peace of mind. (I have used it off and on for stretches of several weeks during periods of greater and lesser stress.) So: product as advertised, functions as expected, I just can't tell whether it's accomplishing anything."
1,It doesn't work,It doesn't work. I can see no change and I've been using the diffuser for over a month. I bought six refills hoping/bekieving that it would create a positive change. None.
5,A visual smorgasbord from a time somehow forgotten,I bought this book about 9 years ago in a Wellington second hand bookshop and have been in love with the images contained within ever since.It provides an inspiration to me of the handmade house as a place of unlimited creative expression and a melding of the function and form of shelter into whatever it's creator is capable of imagining.Savour the images and let them seep into your subcouncious...who knows what journey they may set you upon.
4,"A really neat book--not just for backwoodsmen or ""hippies""!","I really liked this book; it has lots of great photos. The cabins reviewed range from simple to outrageous. The book really inspires one to take up an axe, saw, hammer and nails do some creative ""woodbutchering""! The book's only drawback is that there are no construction plans for any of the houses reviewed; it's simply an pictoral guide to the imaginative art of ""vernacular architecture""--just as the title suggests. The book ""Shelter"" by Lloyd Kahn would be excellent alternative for those wanting more how-to info on building creative, handmade houses."
5,Fond Memories,"I truly enjoyed this book. The homes depicted within were crafted with love and skill. I know a few of their owners, and played a small part in building one of them.It was a time of great ideals. Sure, we remained all too human. Even so, after 30 years, some of those folks still live in their beautiful Handmade Houses."
3,Prequel,"This is the AD Police Origional OVA's set, containing volumes 1-3. These OVA's are a prequel to the Bubblegum Crisis Storyline."
1,junk,THIS VEHICLE IS NOTHING BUT JUNK. IT DOES NOT MOVE WELL ON THE DRIVEWAY AND DOES NOT MOVE ON THE GRASS AT ALL. MY GRANDSON USES HIS FEET TO PUSH IT WHICH IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A $100.00 TOY.VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WOULD LIKE TO SEND IT BACK FOR A FULL REFUND.
3,Planting the Beats,"Riow (Ryo) Arai's album ""Circuit '72"" was the internationally celebrated follow-up to the more ambient-style debut ""Again."" ""Circuit '72"" attracted the attention of the likes of Nobukazu Takemura who adds his remixing skills on Arai's latest project for the Child's View label. The heavy, complicated breakbeat structures on Mind Edit take away some of the mobility of Circuit '72's futuristic drum & bass, and give this third effort a more static feel. But Mind Edit is a release that pulls the listener deep inside Arai's carefully balanced sound cosmos of hi- and lo-fi, lush and simple, future and retro sounds. With sparsely used melodies and instruments, such as piano, bass, strings, or vibes, etching out the monotonous percussion of the 11 rhythm-collages, the album becomes a hypnotic thrilling soundtrack of city life and technology."
2,Where to start?,"1. We stay in Fredericksburg every year on our way to the beach. It has a population of over 20,000. It's not so small that everyone knows everybody else nor does it have only one bar open after midnight nor can you walk everywhere. It's not Mayberry!2. Sutter was a first class snob even though he came from a poor background. Appearances were everything to him.3. Although he hadn't had sex with his girlfriend for months, and she was less than charming, he still had no business having sex with Megan without telling Briana.4. He used Megan, plain and simple. He had sex with her but didn't consider her good enough to take out in public. He had no qualms with hurting Megan when he appeared with Briana since Briana was ""suitable"".5. Megan was foolish to get involved with Sutter but he was pure scum."
1,Don't let the cover fool you,"Ok, I'm sure Cal Pozo is a good guy and a great instructor but the cover is WAY TOO MISLEADING!!! Don't be fooled thinking that there is anyone under 50 associated with this DVD in any way, shape or form. There are a couple of steps that you might find useful but for the most part the rest is useless unless you plan on taking a senior cruise anytime soon. If you're looking for a Lawrence Welk experience (Not meant as a shot) then by all means pick it up you won't be disappointed... but for anything else... stay away."
1,frustrating!!!,"I'm mad to have paid for this DVD! Mr. Pozo only teaches and demonstrates the man's part for most steps, which is frustrating since the woman's part is exactly the opposite. He goes through everything so quickly we kept having to stop and back it up. It doesn't teach you to dance, and it especially doesn't teach you in minutes."
2,Not as expected,"I bought this DVD with high hopes that it would enable me start dancing immediately with different styles, but the DVD has not made me do so. However I must appreciate the candid efforts of the presenter to teach dancing. Even though I think more néed to be done in their next production.My recommendation is that intending buyers should wait for an upgrade. Perhaps, it might be better"
1,Rotten bananas,"So I was under the influence that this dvd was going to teach me ""pary"" dances, anything upbeat would have been exceptional. Not only does Cozo not teach any upbeat dances, I can barely say that he teaches any dances at all. He goes into the foxtrot but goes so fast that 'pause' and 'slow motion' were the only way to learn anything. On top of that he only teaches the mans steps.. Whats that all about Cozo?I bought this dvd expecting apples and might have been satisfied if it turned out to be oranges, but I would have to say that the product I received was a disappointing batch of ROTTEN BANANAS."
2,Yeah....,This product was a tad misleading. I assumed it would be a how to guide for modern/party dancing/club dancing. It was more of a guide to dancing the foxtrot and other traditional party dances taught by an older gentleman that I doubt ever visited a club. I was disappointed but it still helped me get more comfortable with dancing.
2,There Are Better Alphabet Books Out There,"Although normally a Fleming fan, I was extremely disappointed in Alphabet Under Construction. For babies and toddlers just beginning to learn the alphabet, Fleming's illustrations make it difficult to discern letter shape. Particularly problematic is the letter ""W"", in which Mouse welds a bar of steel between W's two interior angled lines. Unfortunately, this means that the inside of the W appears to be an ""A"". My two year old misidentifies the ""W"" as an A every time, and technically, he's correct. Ultimately, the illustrated letters are too abstract for children learning their alphabet. Unlike another commenter, I believe that this book is more appropriate for children who have already mastered the basics of the alphabet and are simply building on that knowledge: namely, preschoolers.For babies and toddlers, there are better introductory alphabet books out there."
5,My son refused to open any more Christmas presents,My son is obsessed with the alphabet at 2 years old. This was the first present he opened from Santa on Christmas morning and it is now January 4th and he still goes to bed with it. His sister had to open the rest of his presents because this book was all he wanted. It is cute and clever and is helping with his spelling..yes I know how crazy that sounds when talking about a two year old.
5,Cute book with good vocabulary.Useful for multiple ages.,"If your little one already knows the alphabet, this book is still interesting because of the vocabulary used as mouse constructs each letter of the alphabet. For example, mouse, ""ices the I"", which my son thought was strange until I told him what icing was."
4,not just another run-of-the-mill alphabet book,"This is a charmingly different alphabet book than most. There is a lot of creativity in it. The title would lead one to think that it is about construction as in bulldozers, contractors, etc. It is however more of a alphabet of home repair. The mouse, Airbrushes an A, Levels an L, Measures an M and Welds a W. The only 2 downsides:1) not all letters fit the motif (e.g. Vaccuums, XRays and Zips) but those are hard letters to work with2) I find the whymsical images to be cute but don't care for the style of art"
5,"Engaging, informative, thought-provoking essays.","From The Ganges To The Snake River: An East Indian In The American West is an engaging, thought-provoking collection of essays written over a period of twenty years in which Debu Majumdar (who was born and raised on the banks of India's Ganges River) wrote while living in Idaho Falls, Idaho during the 1980s and 1990s. The essays cover everything from Mormon missionaries and Native Americas to fishing and horses. Highly recommended and totally engaging, these cultural essays include: First Idaho Winter; Idaho Trout; Fourth of July; Tiger Hunt; Hunting; Mountain River Ranch; The Missionaries; Be Crazy About; An Excursion on the River; Pollywog Pond; The Poets' Club; A Place to Hang Your Hats; Oh Calcutta; At the Windcave; The Ramayana; and Indians Across the Ocean"
5,Mark Twain is Proven Wrong,"Mark Twain may just have been proven wrong. Not only do the East and West meet in Debu Majumdar's thoughtful work, they are given interseting and delightful perspectives. As a person knowledgeable about life in Asia as well as American society, I found the work to be difficult to put down once I started. Majumdar recalls his early life in India's Bengal province and compares and contrasts it to his life in Idaho. These range from his encounters with Mormon missionaries to encountering trout fishes.Great reading! > once I > started"""
4,Engaging Perspective!,"I'm not usually one for essays, but Debu brings such an engaging perspective to his experiences in Idaho that I was hooked for every chapter. The one on fishing was my favorite!"
2,Disappointed,I'm a long time Stooge's fan but should have known that 3D does not provide the additional effects in black & white.
2,RE-RELEASED AGAIN...SAY IT AIN'T SO !!!,I can't believe that these same 4 three stooges shorts are being re-released yet again but now someone came up with yet another brilliant way 3D. even thou the shorts were never in the theaters that way only 2 shemp shorts were.
3,Mancini has a cameo part here,"If you could actually see this film on DVD, you might see the composer of the famousPeter Gunn music in a rare cameo part, playing the piano in the floating casino(?) whilea yound lady runs her fingers though Hanks very short 'do. Kinda campy. I love both Hankand Craig (Stevens) and Blake (Edwarda) so I can't wait for this movie to be made availableon DVD."
2,Same ole ish,"Nothing in this film surprised me. Nothing. During my first time watching, there were several times when I finished the character's lines, it was that predictable."
4,Why Did I Get Married?,"I thought this was a great movie. I actually saw it twice in the theatre and I just had to buy the DVD for my collection. It is definitely a movie I can watch over and over.I realize that all of Tyler Perry's plays/movies hold a message that I can some how relate to. I am not married, but I can still take certain situations from the movie and relay it to my current relationship.I recommend this movie to any and everyone."
3,Better than most Tyler Perry movies,"Pretty good ""chick"" flick, but oh so very stereotypical. Tyler Perry movies just aren't my thing. However, my friends really enjoyed it."
3,Love Tyler Perry!,I liked this movie it made me laugh but it was a little slow. If your a Tyler Perry fan then watch it you'll laugh but keep in mind its not Madea funny.
2,Why did I watch this movie,"""Why did I Get Married"" has a nice message for everyone,but its very boring. I was looking forward to seeing Janet Jackson the most,and she's great in the film,but all of Perry's movies have the same 4 charaters,the abusive guy,the wonderfull guy that saves the abusive wife,the wife that thinks she's better than her husband,then realizes she's wrong,and most of the time Madea,who should have been in this one to save the movie."
1,Why Did I Get Married,Seller sent wrong version. They sent the play version and I ordered the movie.
2,Not so much...,"This movie left me feeling spiritually molested. I am not trying to be deep, but it did make me feel like I needed a shower inside, and it left me feeling a little depressed. I felt like I had to ""shake it off"". I am not sure why it got so many reviews that were positive. I felt it did not show the good side of marriage even close to equally all the drama and sorrow of the bad side in the film. I am married and agree that marriage can be hard sometimes, but I hope no one getting married decides to watch this beforehand because it might scare the H-E double hockey sticks out of them..... A good movie not shy of showing the good and bad marriage is ""The Story of Us"" with Bruce Willis & Michelle Phipher (sp?). Overall it was funny but lacked the depth of marriages subtleies and the complexities that make up a marriage."
4,why did i get married,The movie was excellant. This is the type of movie to have in your collection.
3,Why Did I Get Married,"Kinda boring... even though it had some difinite messages that it was trying to convey... it was well interpreted...but long... I kinda felt like ""OK I get it""... now move on... the ending wes clichè for me... I took a yea, yea approach to this one... between snores..."
4,A must have for all who are married or hope to be,A great movie about relationships and marriage. If you haven't seen it-rent it - then buy it.
3,why did i get married..,Typical Tyler Perry movie; lots of real life situations.I like the premise of the movie but it seemed like it took adultery a bit too lightly. But as always the right people get what they deserve.A few couples meet at a cabin in the mountains. Their talking with each other leads to disclosures that hurt every one.
3,it's okay,too hard core! Too much violence!! too much talk about God!!! there were no bikes in it!! where was Janet's brother Michael??
4,I like this one,"This is one of Perry's movies that I enjoy quite a bit. I've watched it a few times, and I'm sure I'll watch it some more."
2,Mediocore,"I'm sorry Tyler, but I loved the storyline and I love you, but the acting was low budget and phony. Everyone was bad and almost mechanical. The dialouge just didn't flow. Jill was the best actress in the movie. I wish Tyler would step it up a few notches."
2,Love Tyler but wasn't impressed,I felt like this movie left me hanging. I heard great reviews-people wanted to see it a second time-when it came out. The cast seemed great also I love Tyler Perry so my expectations were high...........and they were nto met. I don't think the acting was good and I thought the plot could've been better. It really didn't delve into the relationship issues like the beginning makes you think......I mean Janet is giving a lecture on her relationship book. A let down but we are all entitled to one so I will continue to support Tyler.
5,tyler .... he the man,"all his movies are great, they teach you, lots of things about each other, and each movie has a character that you can relate too... and there super fuuuuuuunny MADEA, always keeps it real and to the point .............. every family needs a madea.."
2,Disappointed,"The storyline was great and the characters were as well. The thing that I hated was the use of profanity. It was used extremely too much for my taste. I usually enjoy Mr. Perry's movies and buy them, but this is one I will not buy."
2,skipped though movie,"came on time but skipped played in 2 dvd and 1 blueray to check it out but still skipped, even put dvd repair on it!!!!"
5,Why did UI ge Married,An excellent production on true life experiences .It gives a married peron time to reflect on how to make your partner happy and how to resolve issues and love in harmony.
5,Must see!,"This movie is another wonderful Tyler Perry creation! The casting is great and very well rounded. Each of the characters has their own story and own drama that they are going through. Everyone can find one of them to relate to! It's a great mix of comedy with a message to get across. You'll smile, laugh, get tearful...definitely worth seeing! My girl Angela is a trip! lol."
5,great reference,"Wow - I've never seen so many different martial arts conditioning exercises in one place. Tons of clear pictures make the exercises easy to figure out and each exercise describes how it applies to martial arts so you can figure out what ones you should be doing. Other background info about power, flexibilty, etc, is well organized without any useless fluff - to the point and easy to apply to martial arts. Great book for any style."
5,More comprehensive than just about any book I've glimpsed on the subject!,At first glance you might think this book is full of it. DON'T THINK THAT! This book has a huge amount of scientific basis behind it! The information is sorted in a very accessible way and the techniques inside are excellent! I recommend this to anyone looking for serious fitness combined with martial arts! I will stress however on the serious because the techniques underlined in this book should be taken seriously.
1,Not advertised well,The book is not useable without the CD and is seemed that you would be getting both. Not true. I sent it back.
3,Not that user friendly,"I have to admit that I bought this for looks - then when we used a much cheaper high chair that my in-laws bought when we went for a visit I realized how impractical the Eddie Bauer chair actually is. First of all, it doesn't have wheels which obviously makes it hard to move around and get into place. Second, the chair is not contoured. My son is very small and was always slumping to one side or the other and we would have to put towels in to prop him up. Then when I used the ""cheap"" highchair at my in-laws (an Evenflo) which has a contoured seat, the difference was like night and day! Also, the straps are a pain to get on because there is a part that has to go behind him. All in all I would say - looks nice but if you ever use a more ""modern"" high chair you will realize all the practical conveniences that this chair does not have."
3,seat does not recline,"We bought the seat because it blended with our kitchen and looked great. However, in terms of function, we did not like it at all and ended up buying another high chair that had the ability to adjust to different heights, be able to recline (so that our baby could hold her own bottle which is difficult for an 8 month old sitting totally upright). Another gripe was that it did not support our 8 month old very well and the other one had side supports that helped baby sit upright.This seat is fine for the 12 month month old and up. It was a pain to clean and the seat tended to feel sticky after washing. The tray is a cinch to remove by the 18 month old too - we learned that the hard way."
4,Lively tips for writing letters (or email!),"Edgar Cuthwellis lightly edited this book of Lewis Carroll's miscellaneous pieces for cohesion as a single work. Many of the riddles in the ""Pillow Problems"" section aren't really solvable for current readers, in my opinion, but the ""Night Writing"" essay on the how-to's of letter writing are still quite applicable to email correspondence (and were, frankly, the reason I bought the book). Also includes some of those unstoppable rhymes that come to obsessives in the wee hours, a few hand shadows, and some tips on nocturnal eating. There's also a useful table for a letter-substitution cipher to keep a message private between sender and recipient. This is a sweet book for the Carroll or epistolary collector."
2,if you are a developer this book won't help you much,for a total amateur this book is ok. It spends pages upon pages writing out full programs. It writes out all the HTML etc. this is a waste of time. no wonder the book is so big! If you are really new to both html and javascript this is the book for you otherwise don't waste your time
3,Not for advanced JavaScripters,This book does not cover the details of most of the Javascript objects. The examples are good enough for beginners who are just getting to know javascript.
2,Don't buy this book!,"This book does not cover the JavaScript language as well as the ""JavaScript Bible"" and ""JavaScript, The Definitive Guide"" published by O'Reilly. If you believe in getting the best education the first time around, look elsewhere."
1,Not a Nokia Product,"Upon receiving this item I was already upset because I was led to believe that it was a Nokia product and it is not. The item was a gift, and I was even further upset to learn that the battery is too large to fit into the 3120 to allow the cover to close. DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY!"
1,Don't Trust The Image,The image of this Lithium Ion Battery shown on the website is that of the original battery that come w/ Nokia phone. That battery is made in Japan and it truly has a longer standby life (4-5 days). The one I received in the mail is that of an imitation and the product is made in China. the battery has only 6-8 hours of standby time. I threw it in the garbage after a couple week.Is there a Zero star for this rating.Ben
1,AWFUL!,"This CD was terrible...not at all what i was expecting from Steve Young...I'm not sure it was Steve Young. On closer observation, the picture doesn't look at all like him, and there wasn't any vocals on the CD. I threw it in the garbage because that is what I thought of it."
1,Print Master Gold 16 Software is WAY OUTDATED!,I can't believe how old and outdated this program is. Do not waste your money!
1,Don't waste your money!,"I used to have the print shop deluxe, which I was quite happy with. Because I got a new computer, I had to get a new program, so I bought the PrintMaster Gold Edition. I hate it so much, that this is the first review I have ever written. Please don't waste your money!!! There are literally 1,000's of abstract backgrounds and images...why does anybody need that much of anything abstract? I tried to create my own calendar...VERY different from its predecessor. Not only that, they have ""better"" templates and clip-arts that you can buy from their store. Isn't that why I just bought this??? Horrible!!!"
2,It's ok,"I wanted to make some posters and tshirt transfers, and thought this would be helpful. I ended up finding better clip art via Microsoft word and the internet, which was the main thing I was interested in. To be honest, I haven't explored it a whole lot more since then. It just didn't turn out to be as helpful and interesting as I thought it would be. I am also planning to make some invitations, but they didn't look that great either.Maybe it would be better for kid stuff. It wasn't too expensive, but I didn't really get any use out of it."
5,A National Treasure...and Fading,"This movie is essentially a recording of what's great about America and the American Dream. You will not find a more representative example of passion and commitment. I was stunned to learn the story of the beginning of the legend created by Pistol Pete. I left yearning to know more, and to see what happened in the years following those the movie covered. Don't purchase this movie if you seek simply entertainment. Buy this movie to learn about the art of the possible."
5,The Pistol,"An awsesome DVD & the Amazing talent that the young actor Adam Guier who depicted Pete Maravich.This is a inspirational story to any young person who wants to aspire to better things, it certainly does it for me as coming from a Basketball background myself, however when I was playing my Hero's in the game were Bill Russell, Jerry West, & Dr ""J"" & the likes from that era.It has taken me years to find this flim after 1st seeing this many a year ago.Once again a must watch & highly Reccommended"
2,Coachgromero,"This movie is about the stint in the life of Pistol Pete Maravich in which he is living in Clemson and wants to make it to the basketball team. It does not tell us much about when he played for his dad in LSU or about his jump to the CBA. It is more directed to kids in order for coaches and parents to present Maravich's figure and as a motivational strategy for those kids who need to know that without passion and practice, it is unlikely to succeed."
1,"Review on product "" The Pistol""","The story line for ""The Pistol"" was great if the product was not a bootleg copy. I was extremely disappointed over the quality of the product, but if copy is purchased in excellent condition to be heard clearly, I recommend this film for any youth that is trying to accomplish a goal in life."
4,RAID 0 vs RAID 1,"I bought this product, but am going to return it. I didn't realize at the time that this is RAID 0, which means it has two 500GB drives in it and uses striping. The result is very good performance (two disk heads), but means that if either hard drive fails, you lose all your data. Given hard drives do fail, you just doubled your chance of a serious data loss. Use this drive for performance, but back up with time machine.RAID 1 is mirrored for data redundancy. I would have kept it if it offered RAID 1 support as I want to put all my personal photos on a redundant hard-drive set up and not worry about losing them."
2,Mine crashed & burned when fairly new,"Bottom line -these things do bite the dust. It is a great price and good storage, and when my GRAID2 failed, the company said they would send me a new one right away. But I will not trust it solo anymore - now I am going to have to buy another drive to back up my backup. At these prices it's probably still a good investment, but I wanted to warn the potential buyers that my first drive failed me and I lost 55 hrs of video (and hours of blood/sweat and tears over my video project) overnight."
4,Great Hard drive! Wonderful for Time Machine.,"So far, this has been an excellent hard drive. Excellent performance (and it's pretty too!). However -- I have the drive on a shelf on my desk, so it's pretty close to my face, and I find it to be a little loud. But, this drive is a beast and it probably needs a beastly fan to keep it cool. So, I only turn it on twice a day to back-up.When this one fills-up; I will buy another one and sit it right on top of the first one.There are cheaper drives. But how important is your data to you?"
1,Fails quickly. Buy something else,I should have listened to those who reported these drives failing quickly. While they work they are quite noisy. Mine failed after a few months. I would strongly suggest buying something else.
1,Sack doesn't fit,The cloth filter bag offered as a group with the cartridge filter is way too small to fit. These are not compatible items.
3,Inner 2nd stage filter. Too soon to tell if it is worth it.,"For drywall dust, I would say absolutely, for most everything else, jury is out.I bought it to try and to meet the minimum shipping requirements for the order since I also ordered replacement standard filters."
3,Very small,I had no idea what this fit from reading the description. It wasn't that expensive so I ordered one. It definitely is not for my Sears 6 gal but works very well on my little 1 gal vac.I rate on not just the item but the shopping experience hence my 3 stars for bad description even tho this works.
4,shop vac filter bag,Works fine but a very tight fit on a craftsman filter. Had to inch it up the sides around the filter. It won't slip or move though. I would purchase again.
3,OK Punch set but will bend,This is an OK Punch set for the price but will bend if you hit them too hard with a rubber mallet. I use them to field strip and break down my guns.
1,Vortes 600D pontoon boat cover,"This is a lousy product. It only has 4 straps on each side and nothing to hold the cover down on the front or rear. There is no way you could ever, ever trailer with this cover like the ad says you can. The worse thing is you can not return! Stay away from this cover."
3,Perceptive but dense,"This book started a sort of trend in Plath scholarship: Devalue the biographical. Argue that the figure in the poems is a persona and that biographical truth is elusive. Quite true. But we still should look for biographical truth. The poetry is the creation of a peson, not a persona. Some of Rose's prose is indigestible--mainly fare for the Plath postgraduate."
2,Not much of Elvira...,"The picture quality is so-so, being these videos were made in SLP mode. Elvira only appears in the beginning and at the end; there's none of her funny interruptions during the films, which is disappointing."
5,one of the best new sounds from a awesome german artist,"okay, i have to admit that i am german, but am currently living in nyc. i just love this band. seeed is one of the best german acts that i have ever heard. music from germany has never really been a hit and when i go through the german section in music stores i always see the stereotypical volk music.no way, german music has since evolved! and it couldn't have gotten any better then this! seeed is badass ragga with german lyrics. a must have! also, i just want to add that germany has some great hip-hop."
5,Thank you James! I feel the emotive electric.,"When i first heard the middle eight beats that belongs to 'Great western', i wanted to go outside to find someone to kiss. A stranger with bad weather overtones or a bird with a huge sky lip. The feeling was homage to self referential life which beyond the borders and small ideas. Weird thing is; concept of this album based on traditional images of James Dean Bradfield's life-On saturday morning we will (were actualy) rule the world-kind of feeling clunking to the room. But this feeling can create such gems as; //fatalistic weeping ""Which Way To Kyffin"" or spectral sunshine of ""Say Hello To The Pope"" easily. It roots lie in salt rock'n roll and innocence of soul. Echoing, scrawling vocal range with plenty of messed up ghosts (Probably tribute the missed direction of the last Manic' album ""Lifeblood"" ) and broken promises of the 90's. Very special, quite magical within..."
3,Paradise Lost - Audio CD,"This is an ABRIDGED VERSION.Amazon.com does not mention that anywhere in the promotion.What's on the CD is good. But there are whole 'Books' (Chapters) 'paraphrased'.It's like buying the 13 oz. pound of coffee.Coffee's great, it's just not what was represented to be.Worth 13.99, but know it's not the whole thing."
1,Paradise Lost not that great,"I'm not a big poetry fan, so I thought if I bought the audiobook, it would be tolerable. I was wrong. But the only reason I really didn't like it was because I didn't like the narrator's voice. If you are going to have a British narrator for Epic poetry, the voice should be strong and booming, not weak and nasally."
2,for die hard fans only,"i was very dissapointed. the cover shows a recent picture and i thougth that this is a reunion concert, or at least one of the last ones, but no, it is some old material, from early shows, nothing more."
2,Rereleased live show with some obscure tracks.,"Majority of the live songs are from a live show Warrant released a few years ago on DVD, (The Pay per view 1991 Cajon Dome show).There is the song, Hole in My Wall from Italy in 1992 with a brief appearance from the late Dimebag.Heaven, Sad Theresa, and Not the Size that Counts (Funny and groovy song) are from Warrant's club days...the club days before they were signed.This DVD era takes place between 86 to 1992. There is nothing to showcase their mid 90's stuff and up. There is there photo shoot from 2008 when they regrouped...yeah.From the scraps of DOg Eat Dog cd, they provided the leftovers: Medicine Man, Jonses, and the tune that many Warrant fans have been wanting to hear, POP MUSIC. These tunes are set to a slide show.There are no actual interviews, despite background questions.A purchase for only the diehardest of fans and a rental for the rest."
4,Happy Consumer,"I am very happy with this pa system it easy to use and travel with the sound is great and its light weight, perfect for my ZUmba classes! I highly recommend this product!!"
1,Unacceptable product!,"PWPyle-Pro PWMA930I 600 Watt VHF Wireless Portable PA System/Echo with iPod DockThe microphone does not work unless you hold it within less than an inch from your mouth and the hissing noise and AC humming is terrible. It's very erratic, ok one minute then it's unbearable the next minute. Unacceptable product!"
2,Product Broken on Delivery,"The product was broken out of the box, even though I could tell it was brand new. The extension handle was broken, the speaker sounded like it was frozen or blown and the upper power unit was loose in the case. When I plugged the power in the back the control unit was pushed out of the front about half an inch. I figure someone forgot to secure it on the assembly line.This is the second unit I have purchased because the first one was a good piece of equipment. I won't say not to buy one but be prepared to send it back as they are very inconsistent in quality."
1,Defective unit,I am very disappointed with this pyle pro portable PA system. Whenever I'm using my ipod there's this hum noise and sometimesnthe volume goes up real loud by itself.
2,Would not recommend,I agree with Rosie's review as I experienced the same issue.It was very disappointing when i started hearing a static interference when i plugged in my ipod.Would not recommend.
2,"noise, low power",I purchased this item for a room for about 50 people to announce. 600-watt? I didn't believe its ad instead I expected 50-watt. When I turned on the power switch natural (basic) noise was loud and when turning on the VHF wireless mic the noise was too loud. I gave two star because it has many functions such as ipod player and charger and wireless mic. Otherwise one star is enough.I think its normail power is around 15~20-watt and max is 50-watt. You can use it outside or in a noisy place with people talking. Don't expect listening to music in a quiet place. Far away from people and speaker. We will use this with wired mic because of the loud noise with wireless mic. If its natural noise is low I would give 3 star.
5,great system,I purchased 6 of these based on a recommendation from a professional associate to use at a martial arts event. They work great. Delivery was very fast and every one worked perfectly. The only thing I needed to purchase was a a 3.5mm male (on each end) patch cable to connect other music players that were not iPods or iPhones. Battery life is excellent and the wireless microphones were a cool addition.
3,Pyle-Pro PWMA930I,"We are satisfied with the sound, although, out of the box it is not very dependable. There seems to be a loose wire in the cabinet. At times you have to bump the cabinet to get the P.A. to work."
4,Good for the price,"With todays technology there are definately better units available but not for this price. I teach Spinning classes at different gyms where the music systems are often adjusted by so many people it sounds terrible. I was getting really upset (if youve taken spin class you know how important music is) so I decided to buy my own portable unit w/mic.Well, this is not loun enough for a full class but is better than nothing. Also very very cheap compared to other options! It gives me security as a back up music source or seperate mic. I put it in the back of the room so people back there can hear me. I have noticed a hissing thats really annoying unless theres something loud enough to cover it playing. All in all I can't complain for the price...(seller was absolutely horrible though!)"
3,Wireless PA system,"We use a portablePA system for classes in rooms that do not have overhead PA. Our old system worked just fine, but after several year, was no longer reliable. We searched for a portable PA system that could reliably take its place and came up with the PYLE-PRO PWMA9301 600 watt Wireless Portable PA System/Echo with ipod deck. The microphone which is wireless has never worked and needs to be replaced.Our facilities manger was able to rig up another microphone and plug it into the system and has made it workable although the sound is a little distorted.So my question is how do we replace the microphone without having to send the whole unit back?Linda TropeExecutive DirectorE.A. Myerberg Senior Center3101 Fallstaff RoadBaltimore, Maryland 21209410-358-6856"
1,Inferior product and service,"The product sound was inferior compared to other speaker systems I have, and the ipod dock did not work at all. When I returned it, the company gave me a return authorization in a timely manner but did not communicate with me about a refund until I continually asked them about it. Their responses were short, cryptic, and would only explain a small portion of the return process."
1,not good,"to rate this product at 600 watts is deceptive to say the least, very poor sound quality and played as loud as a 20 watt system"
1,Did not like,Awkward to roll. Battery did not hold charge for more than an hour. Also makes a loud hissing noise when volume is low
2,"Microphone is garbage, unit is OK.","After many years of needing a quality PA system, we purchased this item. The PA system itself is great, however, the microphone it comes with is garbage. It does not function well, if at all. You have to literally place your mouth against it to work and then it goes on and off. Very embarrasing in a public speaking situation. Beware however of purchasing the wireless microphone Pyle-Pro Lavalier Wireless Microphone PDWM96 to go with it as it does not function at all. Unfortunately, our businees does not allow us alot of free time, thus we failed to ask for a replacement or return wothin the mandated 30 day window. the manufacturer wants us to pay more for return shipping than the units costs itself."
2,not great,product was recommended a friend. but it a came with broken handle and static when ipod was plugged in. sent it back and it came back with a fixed handle but still static with ipod. i gave up and put it in storage and went to store and bought a different system. Don't have time to ship it back and forth. i will take it as a loss. no biggie
3,I like it but...,"I use this system for my Zumba classes outside of the gym. I only experience the hissing noise when recharging. I don't use the mics so I can't comment on them. One of my complaints is it doen't get as loud as I expected. I only get adequate sound when my iPod and the system volume is maxed out. Also the handle doesn't extend up far enough to make transportation easy. I'm 5'6"" but have to reach down to pull the thing and it only rolls smoothly over completely smooth surfaces. I'm going to have to buy external speakers for modify the handle to get this to my standards; however I still think I got a good system for the price."
3,Sansa Wall Charger,"Feels flimsy compared to other wall chargers. One should be careful, as I expect this will break under very limited stress."
2,nothing but troubles,i have had nothing but problems with this thing it wont stay in my sansa and when it does half the time it wont charge it
5,very spiffy book!,"i was impressed by how well Iannini understood infrared optics and temperature. This guy is very knowledgeable and is out there on the bleeding edge.No, its not a paint by the dots hobby book by Mr. Rogers Neighborhood! This is an outta da box type book, where he pushes the boundaries of electronic engineering. Perfect for creative inventors.And he might be pushing you somewhere you didn't expect! ( evil laugh)"
4,Great Projects,Great Product! Tons of great electronic projects with fairly easy to follow instructions. One of the better Evil Genius book. Thanks!
4,son is pleased,My son being a computer geek asked for this book at xmas when he opened it he was like a little kid again (he is 26 )
5,Works perfect!,"I was looking for an all-in-one cord so I could put my computer in another room because the noise coming from it bothered me. This worked exactly how I had hoped! There is no lag or lack of quality at all! It has all the cords soldered together next to each other. The monitor cable is the thickest one. I had to order a 25 foot UBS cable extension for my mouse, but that's it. Great product!"
5,Wife uses it for her two 3lb yorkies,"The wife loves this thing, uses it to take her teacup yorkies out everywhere. It works really well and I haven't had to fix it, so I guess I can't complain!"
4,doggy stroller,It has been a good thing..I personally have a hard time closing it up other than that it's been pretty good Jesus is Lord.
4,Meets Expectations,A little bulky but i find it really useful when taking our lazy pug our for walks... over all i'm satisfied.
3,Not really a guide,"I bought this book because I just inherited my first harpsichord and I thought this book would answer some questions I had after receiving it. The book spends the first few chapters going over the history, then one chapter on how it works with very few illustrations, and then the rest of the book is devoted entirely to playing the instrument. I had hoped to see more illustrations and a glossary of terms but was disappointed upon reading it. I would recommend this book to someone interested in a brief overview of the instrument and mostly learning to play, but not for someone who want to better understand the instruments inner workings."
2,Company won't facilitate returns,"As with any costume you order online for kids, there's a good chance it won't fit. This company specifies that the size is 2T to 4T, but it is definitely no larger than 2T. When I followed their instructions to return the costume, I never received any reply or authorization, something required to get a refund. While the costume was fine, I'd recommend buying it from someone else."
5,A really great collection of songs.,"Before the movie came out, you were able to listen to little snippets of the movie's music on the web site. I love this soundtrack. A great mixture of jazz (Stacey Kent) and some great indie music (Le Tigre). Perfect to play for a dinner party or a gathering of friends.This is really the only soundtrack that I like all the songs.Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,uggggg,not good at all!!!! while watching the movie i thought it sounded like a great soundtrack... but i think they must have put all the bad songs on it
5,I just melted when I heard Duke Ellington's In A Sentimental Mood,"I recently saw the movie Prime and there was this scene when Uma Thurman (Ralfi) was sharing with Bryan Greenberg (Dave) this song....it just reminded me of those days when i shared songs with Reeny, a special girl who i've shared many songs with...and when this song came on in the movie..though neither me nor her have ever heard it before,as the title says..it really really really gets you into the very sentimental part of you(wish I could share it with her,somehow,someway).Though we are not together anymore, I just realized that music and song go really well together with fondness and love.The movie ends with Yamagata's rendition of I Wish You Love which...the movie also ends with Dave and Ralfi going their separate ways....knowing what they had is now just a pleasant memory that only they know..and only they will never forget.By Jason de Souza."
3,Does anyone know?,Who is the artist singing the hip-hop dance tune in the scene where Rafi and David are driving to the Hamptons? The tune is repeated during the credits...
5,Best Bet for Families with Young Children,"My kindergartener loves this CD and so do I! The songs are fresh and fun, with enough humor to make these songs easy for grown-ups to listen to! Dr. Joel even makes veggies fun in Veggie Train. My daughter loves Stinky and Yow, but Glue is my favorite."
5,Funny and Fun,"If you are tired of your children's music and need a breath of fresh air, ""Watch Them Grow"" is a must have. The lyrics are original, fresh, funny and memorable. My elementary school aged children were entertained for a two hour car ride and immediately memorized the words. Younger children will probably also love the music."
2,Nothing very special,"This book is quite a deception. It's very thin, you don't learn anything very special and there are a few annoying mistakes, starting by RFK's name (which isn't Robert Francis Fitzgerald Kennedy!!). There are no photos and the cover picture is ugly. If you want a short good biography with photos, buy ""a ripple of hope: the life of Robert Kennedy"". If you want a complete biography, buy ""Robert Kennedy and his time"". Don't waste your money on this, but at least the author likes RFK."
5,The STONES as carrier of subconscious cultural tension,"This film is one of the greatest rock documentaries ever made. I consider it to be more important than WOODSTOCK. Tension, fear, and hate are presented as an undertone to the peace, love, and happiness of the countercultural movement of the late 60's. Climax arrives at the Altamont Speedway. The Hell's Angels serve as Security guards. The band tries to make its way through ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" but must stop due to the rampant violence and destruction which the song generates. Jagger proclaims that something sinister seems to happen everytime they play that number. It's incredible. Not to mention the Killer performances of Ike and Tina(have you ever wanted to see her fondle a microphone) and Jefferson Airplane who's guitarist is knocked over the head in mid set."
3,Raw Stones,"Not a bad CD but way to short on the actual music side, just getting into it when it ended."
1,not viewable in all parts of the world,"Although i really wanted to see this movie on blu ray,perhaps amazon should be more specific about blu ray zones,as i cannot watch this movie here in Australia."
1,defective dvd,"This DVD might be very good, but I have no way of knowing for sure since it is so defective that it is impossible to watch!!"
1,the video production is really bad!,"The video production is really bad. Too much bloody pics and overwhelming interviews. Some songs are ok but are poorly recorded. About the riot? hmmh Mick Jagger & co have to learn their experiences from the past yes? in fact, the Stones shows in the 80's and 90's are much better organized than this one.PS: I remember when I watched Deep Purple at the BANG YOUR HEAD FESTIVAL in BALINGEN SOUTHERN GERMANY. Like Stones, Purple is also one of the best Rock contemporary in the 70's hey day. Fortunately I did n't see any quarrels & fights between the audience. Everyone was happy & glad to watch the band kick back and play. Though PURPLE's hard rock classic sound is much more thunderous and louder than Stones ever did on stage."
5,A classic documentary!!! This Criterion DVD delivers!!!,"This great film finally gets the DVD treatment and it's spectacular!!! It's from Criterion so you know you're getting nothing but the best!!! The transfer is superb!!!(There is a cool restoration demo on the disc!!!)And the sound is top notch too!!! Extras include a commentary,outtakes,trailers and much,much more!!! Great for Rolling Stones fans or anybody that loves classic rock and roll!!! AN AWESOME DVD!!! Five Stars!!! A+"
3,Great - but different,"Criterion had the right idea in cleaning up the audio, but the end result is a better *environmental* mix - there is a lot more crowd noise and a lot less bass and drums in the mix - I don't want to knock it too much, because it's a great DVD - but I was surprised watching the expose about how they 'improved' the audio, when the end result, while probably 'correct', lacks much of the warmth and vocal presence of the previous version -"
1,A Tragedy Indeed!,"Not this DVD, Video or whattever it's on nowadays again!!!!!!!It's a documentary of a concert that went wrong, due to the Stones hiring The Hells Angels as security!!! Now, How exciting can that be??!!!! The Stones start playing, they have to stop, they start again, stop again, and so on, and so on.A good video? Hell no!Stones trying to cash in again? Definetely!"
1,racism in rock n roll? the guy wanted to shoot Jagger?,"After I watched the show on TV, I don't even care what the other two reviewers said that the black guy wanted to shoot Jagger on stage and he was killed by the people who saw his act directly. My honest opinion is: I`D NEVER BEEN A STONES FAN. It is the fault of the band & their security themselves, because they gave the concert in Altamont for free. As a result was: everybody from all villages came to see the band, they carried anything they wanted to bring; knives, bottles, haschisch, beers, dogs, children, guns what ever...without being checked seriously by the security.I'd rather to see Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Purple or Black Sabbath shows."
5,Stare into the face of madness and never be the same...,"This film set out to capture ""The Woodstock of the West Coast"" and ended up documenting, in frightening detail, the end of the sixties. Watch as drugged-out, disillusioned hippies grow restless and violent during an out-door concert on the Altamont Speedway outside San Francisco. This is one of the best sociological documents of all time, depicting the descent of a mob into chaos and disorder. A horrifying and macabre view of the end of an era. Essential to any collection."
4,rock history,"Once upon a time, long ago, the Rolling Stones were at the cutting edge of rock both musically and culturally. THis film is of thir US tour of 69 when they ruled where ever they played. But it wasn't enough. An apparant murder in the crowd was filmed at a poorly organised concert near the end of the tour and became the anti-Woodstock: the day the dream of rock saving the world had to be put away. this film brillantly contrasts the Stones apparantly invincible power on the stage with their vagueness and ineffectuality off it. A true classic of documentary film-making."
5,A must see for anyone interested in Altamont.,This video should be seen along with reading Rolling Stone issue #50 and Sonny Barger's book 'Hell's Angel' for a full perspectiveof that day.
4,I was there!,"I saw it a long time ago and I want to see it again, mostly because I was at Altamont! Movie is good but being there was better."
2,How about releasing the entire CONCERT??,"Arguably the BEST period for the Stones and we get 3 or 4 songs and a HUGE amount of documentary. It's fine to watch it once, but wouldn't it be nice if they put out a DTS version of all the MUSIC??"
5,Classic,"Great stuff...By the way Blaine,PA stands for PUBLIC ADDRESS not POWER AMPS! I hate rock illiterates"
3,LET'S CLEAR THIS UP,"before you believe any idiot that tells you the black guy was killed because 'racism', make sure you watch the film.this guy goes straight up to the stage with a GUN pointed at mick jagger, probably less than 10 feet from him. the Hell's Angels rightfully grab him and one wrongfully stabs him. this has nothing to do with his race. this was stopping an attempted murder of the leader of the Rollings Stones."
4,The 70s Begin,"Much enhanced picture and sound quality from the original theater version. It seems there's also added footage. It's a great documentary of a historical social event. It does seem to drag a little, perhaps the times have changed or the added footage is too long, but its definitely worth it anyway. I highly recommend watching this film."
5,Stoned,"Altamont could have been just as good as Woodstock when you look at the bands who were playing! Jefferson Airplane,CSNY,Flying Burritos and The Stones were are their peak back then.It all started so well with a good atmosphere being created by The Flying Burritos.Chris Hillman said years later that they had no political statement to make and everyone was having a good time.Then you can feel the tension as the Hell's Angels roll into town.Its bad enough watching the violence on screen and what starts off as a good vibe turns into a nightmare!When the Stones took the stage I don't think there was much they could do to keep the peace,when you look at the hate stares Jagger was getting he tried his best for some calm.If the Stones had walked off stage things would probably got worse!The last scene when they are scrambling into the last helicopter is just like a scene from Vietnam! The end of a dream!!!"
5,Altamont and all that.,"A classic of our times, or before them for some people. See Tina before she became a grandmother, airplane before they became Starship, the Burrito Brothers before Gram died and Mick before he became a characature of himself. The scariest night in rock history retold and a testament to the decade that gave us so many bands. Watch it over and over again as it gets better every time. Mick is skinny, Keith is majestic and Charlie is Charlie."
4,The Storm is threatening...,"While not a piece of cinematic brilliance, if you like the Stones and rockumentaries you'll be pleased. It has some nice footage and really shows what happened at Altamont, which is what the film mainly focuses on. If your looking for a film full of performances, this is not it, though there is footage of some songs from the '69 tour before Altamont, as well as a great clip of Tina Turner, who opened for the Stones during the tour. Check out the book True Adventures of the Rolling Stones for more from '69 Stones!"
3,Hits & misses,"This documentary of the Stones' ill-fated 1969 American tour is quite good at times, with some excellent concert footage featuring the Stones, Ike and Tina Turner, The Flying Burrito Brothers, and Jefferson Airplane. However, the film bogs down quite badly during the prolonged (and boring)sequences featuring Melvin Belli. Less gab and more music would have improved this film vastly. It's OK, but hardly a classic."
3,Don't get this for the music,"This is an interesting, perhaps even a historically significant, film, but it definitely is not one of the better *music* DVDs out there. The sound is great, but the Stones are out of tune with each other and with themselves, they consistently miss changes and flub endings, and the other performers are even worse.Get Your Ya-Ya's Out is a much better buy and one of the best live rock recordings. Of course, it's cherry-picked from the Stones' entire tour and not a single concert."
3,Rolling Stones DVD Gimmee Shelter,Pretty interesting tour with the stones back in the 60s. Would have liked more full length song clips
5,Nice opal,This is reallly a nice size and well put together jewlery. Get lots of complements on it it goes with most outfits.
2,what you see is not what you get,"the suprise in the box is NOT the young, active, kinetic couple pictured. This instruction is very very very much more suited for an older, less active, inexperienced audience. I have written other reviews regarding cal pozo's work. Let the buyer beware."
4,Good intro to basic steps,"It doesn't matter who is pictured on the cover, the instructors go slow and show you the basic steps from several angles, and explain it all very well. I am in my 50s and learning is not as fast for me as for younger people, so it suited me just fine. They teach and explain the differences for several styles of swing, so you can try them all or just do the one you like best.I first borrowed it from the library then looked here to buy it, since I can only keep it out for a week at a time from the library and it always has a waiting list. I highly recommend trying before you buy!"
3,Fun,"I like learning to swing dance, but I still can't get my husband to dance with me. It is a little hard to keep up with."
4,Encyclopedia of Paden City Glass,"This is a very good book on Paden City glass patterns. However, there seems to be a few patterns not included, such as cuttings. Pictures are beautiful and clearer than some books I have."
4,Interesting reading,"I have enjoyed Kalpakian's books in the past and this one was no exception. I liked the way she presented an unusual situation and locale, and how the characters' lives all became so intertwined. This is a testament of the author's skills at weaving a complex story into a believable whole.The secrets that have been kept over the years, on Isadora Island and beyond, drive the story and keep the reader intruiged. The few students of the mysterious, free-spirited Sophie Westerveldt at Temple School learn unusual lessons that will stay with them far into their futures.I am not usually fond of books that move around in time, back and forth, but Kalpakian's skill kept the book from seeming choppy. The story emerged gradually and allowed the reader topeel back the layers and put all the pieces together.A good read."
4,Unexpected and fun,"This was a book that pulled me into the setting, Isadora Island, and made me care about the characters, even when I put the book down. The school was somewhere I wished could exist so I could send my girls, even if the people running it were a bit off the wall, reminding me some of characters from Dickens. The references to literature, and the arts were fun too.One thing I also appreciated was the way the author worked a bit of eroticism into the story. For someone who studies all manner of different erotic writings, this angle was welcome. It was well done, tasteful and resonated.I definately recommend this book."
5,Best of 2003,This is an excellently written and crafted story. Best along with Human Stain. This would actually make a very good movie as opposed to Human Stain which should not be a movie. The story is perfect in every way. I will read all of this author.
5,Very Nice Workout,"This is a very good beginning workout. The instructor is motivational. I had some problems following him and the class on the jumps, but then I stopped looking at that portion and just went off of what was being said."
1,Lousy,"This was the most boring video I have watched. I have attended many spin classes and when I go, I want someone that ""makes"" you get up and spin your butt off. This guy let you choose your intensity and just did not encourage me to do my best, instead, offered a way out at every level. I know that if you can't keep up it is ok to sit and rest and then resume, I am for that, but I need someone to make me get up and do my best."
4,politically incorrect at its best,"this album was great when we skated back in the day, and it still kicks A@#"
5,Super funny/super fast,"Anyone who can't find the humor in this is just a major tight ass. This is one of my favorite cd's. I can't put it in my mp3 player when I go running, because even still, after all these years it makes me laugh. Not a good combo. But any other time, just the perfect cd to enjoy all that is Milano and Co. This cd kicks, a classic."
5,M.O.D. fun AND heavy,"When I first bought this album I had already been exposed to S.O.D. so I had an idea of the contents. Needless to say, I was not dissapointed. This album rocks with the best thrash/metal albums in existence. Billy Milano's crude, rude and funny lyrics add re-playability just as much as the catchy guitar riffs do. If you are into Metal and or thrash and appreciate it with a good sense of humor look no further..."
3,"Crude, to the Nth degree","Classic 80s hardcore which crossed over to metal radio. The songs are rude and crude, but largely funny as hell. The track A.I.D.S. is as insensitive and un-PC as it gets, but you really must hear it. Spandex Enormity pokes fun at the fat groupies wearing spandex pants trend which was big in the late 80s. Overall, most of the songs have a similar sound and a lot of them are hit or miss, but overall it's a fun and campy disc."
5,The Greatest,As always - Steve never fails. This is another of his great works. Can't wait to hear what he has coming out next.
3,Not as good as his others,"I was disappointed in his latest album. I have all of Steve Tyrell's CD's including his Christmas CD. I've seen him in concert several times and I love his music, but this CD fell flat of his usual deep, robust sound. If you like Steve buy it, but if you've never heard him or heard his earlier stuff, go for an earlier CD before getting this one."
3,A BIG FRANK FAN,"A GOOD SINATRA TRIBUTE CD, BUT SUFFERS LIKE ALL THE REST. I HAVE SINTRA SINGING SINATRA. WHY WOULD I WANT OR NEED ANY ONE ELSE SINGING SINATRA?"
5,Well Done Tyrell,"This is very well done and a tribute to Frank and Family!!!Bob Mercer, I have the Frank Sinatra cds so I know what I'm talking about!"
4,Great unforgettable Sinatra songs,"Anazon makes the old, hard to find songs easy to find and order. I was delighted to find the Sinatra CDs to give to my husband for his birthday, and he was thrilled to get them. The CDs have better sound than the originals."
3,Enjoyable vocal production,"First I must say that I thoroughly enjoy listening to this production. I removed three stars because I purchased this DVD to listen to the tenors. Unfortunately, though, the voice track has less volume than the instrumental track, and even worse is the audience track (applause) is even louder. It makes it rather irritating to have to raise the volume to hear all the nuances of their voices, but have to lower it when the song is done."
1,"It's a lemon, static and echo on the handset, loses messages","I thought most phone sets were comparable these days, boy was I wrong. We just got this phone and I wish I had saved the packing so I could have taken it back. This phone gets a lot of static and it always sounds like you are in a cave. Now we just found out that the answering machine is losing messages.You can do much better for the price than this."
2,Nice low end system,"Liked the equipment and it all went together pretty easily. However, negatives were:- quality of base speakerphone was poor- callers complained of 'fuzziness' when on call using one of the handsetsTook it back"
1,"I'm not as smart as you, the first one stopped working so I bought another one!!!","At first this phone system was GREAT. But then,for no reason, you would answer the phone and the cordless phonewould just beep at you. I reregistered the cordless phone with the base and it would be ok for awhile. But what Ireally like is the GIRL'S voice in the middle of the night saying (in a loud voice) ""Press MEMO to recieve setupinstructions"" There is no volume control for this message, I tried.It is random, you might here the message every 15minutes or sometimes every 1/2 hour or every hour. My remedy was to unplug it. The first one went into the trash.I paid 99.00 EACH for both of mine. After awhile all I got was black bars across the display which render the wholesystem useless."
1,Save your money!!,"Bought this set from another vendor not amazon, we had to return the first box because the answering machine wasnt working properly, the replacement we got does its job with poor quality. I'm not even going to waste my time writing more about this phone, all I'm going to say is go for another brand. I just bought a Panasonic phone and its awesome."
2,Not Great,"I have owned this phone for about 3-4 years. At first, I hated it because on most calls I could barely hear the person I was talking too even with the volume turned all the way up. Then we switched to cable telephone service and suddenly the volume on my phones was GREAT! But then a few months ago we started losing calls on the cordless handsets and the caller ID on one of the handsets became unreadable. Thought it was the batteries, so bought new ones, but the caller ID is still unreadable. And we are also getting that random ""Press memo to receive setup instructions"" message for no apparent reason. Also have had problems recently with having no dial tone and have to unplug the main base/answering machine and plug it back in to make it work. I have a feeling this phone is dying. Does anyone make cordless phones that last more that 5 years? But because the phone is not completely useless (yet), I give it 2 stars."
1,"""press memo to receive setup instructions""","This phone is unbelievably bad. Static, calls dropped, handsets don't work reliably, confusing base station keys---and (WORST)the voice message it emits at random times: ""Press memo to receive setup instructions,"" which cannot be erased, stopped, or disables. If you google this phone you'll see that many , many people who have bought the phone have this problem.This phone is so bad that I will never buy a GE phone again - of ANY type. If I could have submitted this review with zero stars, I would have, because this product doesn't deserve even one star. GE should be ashamed of itself."
5,Great GE cordless phones and answedring machine,I am very pleased with this purchase . I received it sooner than expected thank you Lori
2,only 10 speed dial numbers,"on the box its says ""40 Name & Number"" but in fact you can only save 10 phone numbers in your address book which is consistent with the user manual. Not sure why any phone made in this day and age would only have 10 memory slots. The phone looks nice but I'm returning it."
1,WORN OUT VIDEO,"This video is worn out. It jumps around, fades in and out, is jumbled and is VERY difficult to watch. Matter of fact - AWFUL!"
4,Realistic Reincarnation Movie,"A pretty difficult movie to come by, Reincarnation of Peter Proud is a gem of a movie. Having first seen it during its initial release in the early '70s, I had not seen it for 25 years. Upon tracking it down, and outbidding some other eager fans of the flick, I anxiously awaited its delivery. It did not disappoint. It had that weird aura about it which complemented the subject matter of the film: Reincarnation, obviously. The cinematography, musical score, and quality acting set this film apart and make it worth owning. It definitely captures a very unique style which you don't ordinarily see with today's films. If you like movies that will make you think about them long after you've seen them, then Reincarnation of Peter Proud is a good choice. Stars a pre-Superman Margot Kidder."
4,"Not bad, not bad","I am probably not qualified to make a judgement of any SH book but I will give you my thoughts on this one.I was not bad as SH stories go. Boiled down, it is about a young Sherlock before the days of Watson in which he becomes friends with Teddy Roosevelt in his younger days. Holmes assists the NY police dept with a murder that eventually turns out to be an assasination plot against the President.It uses alot of quotes from the Canon as well as actual quotes from Roosevelt.The story does not drag but I question some of Holmes methods considering this is his younger days and he ends up doing things that you would expect later in his career, for example ordering a NY police officer to stay at the scene of crime till he can return, it is explained but it still stretches reason a bit.The story is told from TR point of view, as if he had replaced Watson so to speak.I have read worse and have read better but I would recommend giving it a glance."
4,Delightful entertainment,"I am not a Holmes aficionado, having read only 6 or 7 hundred titles and not much scholarly work. I read for enjoyment and found myself laughing out loud on several occasions in this story, not because it is uproariously funny, but because it was so preposterously delightful. The Adventure is not about mimicking Doyle or Watson, although there are echoes of the canon, rather it is a breezy historical romance. . . I thought Jeffers captured Teddy quite nicely. A quick read and a good reread."
5,"""Swiss Army Knife"" Of Management Books","Alan Downs' book smashes current wisdom about business leadership. The book deals with the 7 MIRACLES OF MANAGEMENT. But what Downs has really written is the ""Swiss Army Knife"" of management books: there are tools here to get any manager out of the difficult jams common in today's workplace. Better yet, these tools will help managers avoid problem situations to begin with. --Tom Brown &lt"
4,A SHOW BIZ COMPENDIUM,"This is light, fast reading and a fun book. Grodin seldom names names, but he gives many examples of cantankerous behavior within show biz people in tv and the big screen. I now want to read other books he has written. I enjoyed his work in the movies, but never watched him on tv until he went with CBS. His humor fits well with 60 minutes II."
4,Interesting Read,"I found Mr. Grodin's latest book fairly interesting. I am the opposite of Mr. Grodin politically, but I still enjoy all of his work, and that includes this book."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a Grodin fan, and really enjoyed his previous couple of books. Unfortunately, this one is a big step down. Although he's well known for writing his books in longhand, and usually gives the reader the ""feel"" of being spoken to, this one seems as if it was phoned in. The sad fact is, the last 8 years of Grodin's life have consisted basically of: got his CNBC show, lost it, got an MSNBC weekend gig, lost it, looked for work for a while, landed at CBS 60 Minutes II. The events that connect all this just really aren't that interesting, and not at all funny. And the occasional transcripts of his talk shows fall really flat on the printed page. Love ya Charlie, but your movie talk of the past was far more entertaining than predictable takes on Imus, Stern, Regis, etc. The book jacket promised something like an unprecedented, revealing look into Grodin's personal life. Must have missed it.Better luck next time, if indeed a publisher is willing."
2,Disappointed!,"In teaching some techniques the author does not include a link to the photo sample (i.e. chapter 3, figures 3.48-3.53)This makes working with this book very annoying.Also, sometimes she takes too many steps to get a result that's not very impressive (chapter 3, correcting overexposed images from digital cameras).Now ... on chapter 9, page 274 ... quote: ""Don't le the client watch while you're retouching ...""I think the author takes her own advice and does not want to share all the information with us. This is almost a waste of money! True: I learned some techniques but the author does not deliver enough to make this a good use of my money and time."
2,A professional's touch,"As a digital retoucher who is looking to improve a skill level, I found this book to be one of the few books that was worth every cent I paid for it.This is not a book for beginners. It is, however, a book which will, with sufficient application, help your retouching skills and process understandings no end.I cannot recommend this book highly enough if you are even semi serious about learning to digitally retouch your photographs.In case you're wondering about the 2-star rating: I punched in the wrong number!! But I guess you'd have worked out that I really meant to rate it at a full 5 stars....:)"
5,A Definitive Guide to Photo Retouching & Restoration,This book is excellent. It is well written and easy to follow. What I also like about the book is the abundant source of sample files that are available at Katrin Eismann's website.I would recommend this book to all Photoshop users ranging from beginners to intermediate to expert to so-called expert who would deem this book only for beginners.
5,Great Book--But buy the new edition!!!,"I use this to help me restore old family photos that I have scanned. There is a newer edition, so make sure you buy that."
2,Too many images not included,"Come ON!! For the $50 cover price they can't include ALL the images used in the examples? This is a GIGANTIC FLAW.The problem is worst in the the retouching section- which at only two chapters is not comprehensive enough anyway- where only about 1 in 5 of the images in the exercises are included.The author tries in vain to justify this early in the book by saying that we're eventually going to want to work on our own images anyway. Again, come ON: for $50 the author should have purchased stock images- or shot them herself- so that the reader could work through the exercises using the same images as the author.Further, there is too much restoration and not enough retouching here, and the very important Liquify Filter recieves only scant coverage.All that being said, there is a great deal of useful info here, and even an old PS verteran like myself can learn some new tricks. So I do recommend the book, but I recommend a used copy. (Make sure it's Second Edition.)"
5,Very good book!,"I bought this book about 1 year ago and it has helped TONS on how to get the best out of not only my digital photos but how to tackle the restoration of family heirloom photos as well.The majority of images that were used in the book can be found on the authors web site so you may try the techniques in the book.The author assumes that you have the basic workings of Photoshop down before trying the techniques in the book. If you need to brush up on some of your photoshop skills, then please get an beginners book to get comfortable with the program first. It will make using her techniques a lot easier.I would like to see what is so different in her new version that has come out. If there is enough changes in the book, then it will get a spot in my Photoshop bookshelf! I know that this one did!!!"
1,Don't Bother,"I ordered this smokey quartz pendant because I had been looking for one for a while and waited a long time for it to arrive. List price: $120.00 on sale for $39.99, 10k gold including chain---it sounded like a good buy---but be warned. The chain is so flimsey I would be afraid to wear it for fear it would quickly break. The chain came knotted up with strands of white fuzz in the bag it came in. I have seen larger smokey quartz stones for less than $39.99 much less than the bogus $120.00 list price.The bail is too small to put the pendant on any other chain I own. I have always been satisfied with Amazon jewelry but this is not worth it! I have sent it back."
1,Rip Off,This is only a 1 page overview that you can easily get for free on the internet. There are NO images or exercises like it advertises.Big waste of money. Don't bother.
4,"Hardware is good, SW not so good","I have no problems with the hardware, and it works great using the Windows XP Wifi connection manager. However, the Connection manager that comes with the product lacks some important features, while it has many useless features. The key features missing are: The ability to setup a connection to connect on demand only and the ability to disconnect a connection. These features are needed to make temporary connections, which I cannot understand why the Motorola SW Engineers thought was unimportant. In my opinion, this product is not so good if the user is forced to use the connection manager that comes with it."
4,A fresh look at events unclouded by time and preconceptions,"This is a well written review of the events surrounding the end of the British Mandate for Palestine and the founding years of the emerging State of Israel. A candid look at events, unclouded by preconception. A candid evaluation of the leading figures who guided these events. All carefully documented by detailed record keeping. Presented in clear, polished, and literate style.A valuable read for anyone interested in the history of this period."
3,"One worked, one didn't","First, I was pleasantly surprised that I got more than one replacement with my order. I'm glad I did though. The first pad I replaced my old pad with lasted for only about 5 stamps. This was surprising because the original ink pad had lasted me years I used a second replacement pad, and it's lasting just fine. It's been about six months and it's still working. I don't use it often, but it hasn't dried out so that's good. Great for the one I'm using, but only three-stars because the product wasn't consistent."
2,"not good, will last only 15 overs then crack","I have these cricket balls and one lasts only 15 overs hardly. Don't go for these, rather look for other brands.Ashok"
5,Must have,"I had this book as a kid and loved it then; now that I have a kid of my own and am working on building his library, I knew I had to find a copy of this for him. This book is extremely readable and packed with information on all the classic myths (for any parents out there who are familiar with some of these myths, don't worry, they gloss over some of the more explicit details of ancient Greek relationships, so there's nothing in there that is inappropriate for children). My husband is an RPG gamer and picked this up when it arrived and flipped through it, then sat down and read the whole thing and now wants to know why I didn't get a copy for HIM before now."
3,It has its place,"This is the hint book to the greatest series of games ever, the Quest For Glory series from Sierra On-Line. Each section has a story perspective, to let your know how your character would feel fro experience to experience. Then, for games 1-3, there is a more traditional walkthrough.However, there is no maps, and no guide telling you what you must do to get various game points. The fact that there is no traditional walkthrough of QFG4 is glaring. Worst of all, there is no mentions of the infamous bugs in the games and how to avoid or overcome them. There are worst guidebooks, but you can not be faulted for feeling that this book is lacking."
1,PhoneMan,"As another reviewer stated, The Battery lasts 6 months and then no longer holds a charge. This is my second battery for the Sony T610 phone in less then a year. My samsung phone battery lasted a full year and at least would hold some charge after that long. The orginal Battery was not much better. Based on Battery life my next phone will probably not be a sony."
3,Longer lasting than original,"The bluetooth wireless headphone feature seems to drain the battery very fast (sony t637). This battery last longer (about 50% more air time) than the original 700 ma battery received with the phone. However, after six months of use, the battery started loosing its charge."
1,"Bad product, not even sealed when it arrived...","I suspect these batteries to be used or refurbished. I had the battery for just over a week and it is already holding a much reduced charge! Im getting about 40 minutes talk time. Terrible product, dont buy it!DW"
5,An Inspirational Book,"The Man in the Ceiling is a fast paced story about a young boy's childhood, told like only a young child can tell it. Jules Feiffer creates an alternate world that adults are not often part of, drawing the reader into that remembered world, even if the reader is an adult. The story is one of the artistically struggling young Jimmy who strives to find his talent and himself. His major artistic inspiration is his sailing Uncle Lester the playwright, who first betrays him and then helps him take that final leap towards reaching his goal. I would definitely recommend the reading of this inspirational book, young or old."
5,Excellent Book!,"I was finally able to visit Las Vegas last year and bought several Vegas books as souvenirs. Unfortunately, most of the books only provided information on present-day Las Vegas. Also wanted were pictures of the Las Vegas I had seen on TV as a kid. After all, that is what gave it its magic & attraction to me.This book provides that. Pictures of the old & new are featured on opposite pages for easy comparison. The pictures are large, sharp, & clear, & are of excellent quality to this layman's eye. They are also accompanied by short paragraphs of essential facts such as build dates & owners, along with information peculiar to the specific buildings.I highly recommend this book to the nostalgist."
4,Cool Shots of Old,"Very nice pics and great comparisons from old and new, even if the new are a few years old and a little dated - would be great to get an update with newer photos for now, but Vegas changes so fast that it would have to be updated yearly. A very cool book"
4,Viva Las Vegas,"It's a nice big book with plenty of contrasting photos of various locales in Las Vegas.Each photo, old and new, comes with a brief description and/or historical fact of the structure or location. The info is informative and interesting.While I enjoyed the photos that were presented, the format makes it too ""black and white"". So basically you get the very beginning photo and then the most current photo(usually in the 21st century).Would've been nice if they could've included some transition photos, as a lot of casinos went thru various changes throughout the years.Overall though, I enjoyed the book as it managed to evoke my deep memories of Sin City."
4,Worth the extra money for something that lasts,"As a former garbage man for 7 years I can say without a doubt these things are Tanks! The Rubbermaid Brute cans will easily last as long as 4 or 5 sets of the best cans that you can pick up at Wally World or The Red Bullseye. Not recommended for those in less that honest neighborhoods as they WILL go missing.Although I knew it when I bought them, I am only giving them 4 stars because they don't come with lids. Price is still worth it, I just use my old lids."
5,Very sturdy,The Rubbermaid garbage can is top notch. It is not flimsy and will not blow over in the wind. I kept mine outside and the las vegas summer did not weaken the integrity of the plastic. It is somewhat heavy and when you fill it up it can be a somewhat difficult to transport. However it was a great garbage can and met all my expectations. You get what you pay for and I got my moneys worth out of it.The only drawback was that it was such a nice garbage can someone stole mine! I left it out on trash day and when i got home it was gone. My repalacement can will be painted a bright color to discourage it being stolen a gain.
5,"A great necessity to fill up outside trash bags with cut grass, shrub and hedge clippings.","I am really happy that I got this 32 gallon trash can so i can empty all the grass clippings, hedge and shrub clippings into a black outside trash bag into the trash can. After I am done filling up the trash bag I can tie it up and put it in the trash cart. If I hadn't got this trash container, I would've had a hard time filling up the trash bag. Thank you very much for having this trash can available and sending it me when I needed it. I would really recommend this trash can to anyone who needs to get yard work done or get any other trash taken out."
4,They should be so lucky!,"This disc is the follow up to 1997's ""Robyn is here"" and it will never get played in the U.S., which is a sad reality about the state of music in the U.S. and a shame. Before working with Britney, producer Max Martin collaborated with Robyn. This disc is 100% Robyn (Martin is nowhere to be found) and the slick production was pulled back to reveal an artist in a state of growth. A terrible shame that RCA chose not to release it in the States, which only leads to one question. Was RCA too involved with Christina Aguilera to bring us the sophmore disc from one of Sweden's most promising artists? Considering the number of manufactured pop princesses in the U.S. right now, it may have been a good thing for Robyn's ""my truth""."
2,Not for fans of her current more cutting edge albums,"For those rabid fans who feel the need to collect everything a singer does, I would highly recommend staying away from this album. It's really pretty bad, and is nothing like what her current albums are showcasing. The only two good songs on this album are ""Electric"" and ""Main Thing"". Kinda funky, but still dated. To fans who love her as much as I do....look forward....don't look back."
1,An highly overrated cd that really isn't good at all,"Robyn, formerly Robin, before she changed the name to make it look more cool and american, is an extremly overrated artist. Her winy little voice is so annoying in songs that don't have a beat good lyrics or anything else you would want in a song. To sum it up it sucks!"
5,Annointed Woman of God,"This album is GREAT!! I must say that the reviewer Ryan was totally off the mark and should listen again. And to the one who wanted a repeat of ""The Best Is Yet to Come"", just go listen to it again. Martha has given us new and exciting music to usher us into the presence of God. The Lord wants to hear a new song, not more of the same old stuff. To anyone who doesn't have it, buy it. It is excellent and will not disappoint. Martha Munizzi has come for such a time as this!!"
1,"A Huge Fan, BUT.....","First, let me say that I am a huge Martha Munizzi fan. Love, Love, Love her. The woman is bad! - BUT...I have to agree with Ryan....This album was very disappointing. In my opinion, she did not deliver. You cannot take away the fact that she is a great singer/songwriter, but there is a very big difference between ""No Limits"" and ""The Best Is Yet To Come"". It's unfortunate that Israel & Aaron were not involved as producers on this one, because that is where I feel like this is a miss.I still love and listen to ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" and her Christmas CD ""When He Came"". Those two CD's are awesome."
1,No Limits,"This cd was a disappointment. The title of her last album was ""The Best is Yet to Come"" and she didn't come through. She talks too much, the songwriting is weak and the whole album comes through as unsatisfying. The song with the rap is hilarious though - definitely worth hearing for amusement value if nothing else.I'd say this album is a definite don't buy."
2,adapter has short life,"The coke machine is great and nostalgic, but the adapter only lasted a few months before burning out. At least they should make an adapter that will last a few years before replacing.I have tried to reach the maker of the dispenser but they do not respond, so it seems like you are on your own."
3,maybe my expectations were too high,"I heard a track from this album and loved it! I immediately sought the cd for purchase, without really previewing it. Still, there are a few nice tracks on this album."
2,I don't get it,"I really did not care for this album at all. I haven't heard one track that I really liked. She has a decent voice but the music was quite blah (i.e. grits without and salt, pepper, butter, and cheddar cheese.) I will listen to the samples more closely before I purchase the next album."
1,"Holy! Can you believe this, she made two CD's?","Gez folks, just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water! Save your time and mostly your money. The CD is a sleeper for sure. You'll have more enjoyment with a barrel of monkeys!Do radio stations really play this stuff?! Volume 1 is worse than Volume 2."
3,Hidden Agenda - Whatever Happened To...,"Hidden Agenda, formerly of the Metalheadz camp, finally release their aptly titled album, Whatever Happened To..., but those folks expecting more jazzy drum `n' bass that marked their 12""s will find them in short supply. Instead, they concentrate more on breaks and electro, as evidenced by the first two tracks, ""Salvation"" and ""Something Somewhere,"" respectively. ""Low Jazz Fidget"" is only a crazy swing jazz interlude, one that leads into the breaks of ""Redress."" ""Inside-Outski"" gets more melodic and, therefore, more interesting. ""Vindication"" finally gets to the drum `n' bass we've been waiting for, and it's a sweet piece of work. A mixed bag, overall, but worth the wait and the answer to a long-burning question."
3,Un-noticed classic...,"It's been about 10 years since I've even listened to it, but as of today, I can officially say it's classic. This is very traditional thrash sounding. Horrible production, but hey, they were on Caroline back in the day and every good thrash band at first had horrible production. A little bit of typical Zombie doom n' gloom as well, although the lyrics weren't quite as vague and they would later become. Fans of early Metallica and ""South Of Heaven/Seasons In The Abyss"" era Slayer should be able to find something they like in this album. Definitely not the sound of the White Zombie you heard on the radio, but not too far off as well. I'd even go so far as to give this 4/5 stars had the production quality not been so low... but just turn it up! Not to mention the bass and treble as well..."
4,Grrreat Album Bad Mixing,"Even though guitar god hadn't shown up yet they had John Ricci on this album and he did some great stuff taht works just as well (he had to leave the band because of carpal tunnel syndrome. weak.). These are some of the best songs White Zombie ever put out but the mixing on this album is pitiful. The bass might as well not have been recorded. You absolutely MUST turn the bass and treble up to make this album even sound normal. And even then it sounds about half as heavy as it should. The guitar is playing these fast chunky pal-muted riffs that if yo went and played them on your own amp in your bedroom would sound ten times heavier. Great album, get hold of a copy if you can or download the songs. If you liked La Sexorcisto you'll love this album, though it might take a couple listens to be honest."
3,HA!,"This cd isnt bad so thats not why I'm laughing BUT I used to have this record a LONG time ago. I bought it at a used cd place for 9.69. I knew it was rare but I had no idea people would be selling it for over 100 dollars! Ha ha! The suckest part of this story is that after I broke up with my girlfriend at the time, I moved out and never saw this cd again. That was 7 years ago. Well more about the record: you can definately hear the beginnings of the great white zombie in the record but Rob's vocals are a little annoying in it and of course, the sound quality isnt the greatest BUT it is an irreplaceable addition to any zombie lovers arsenal. I wont buy it for as much as its going for on here though. No way."
4,it's about a real problem faced by most girls,"and not too many books have touched on such problem, so it's worth reading to your girls, only that the ending is again too happy, which detracts from the realism of the problem situation"
3,Best quality audio,"Excellent product price ratio, the performance of their quality is unmatched. However, the RMS power that expresses the manufacturer is a bit doubtful, because at times the low frequency components are drowned with much facilidad.Good product"
4,Outstanding! I had no idea...,"I had no idea of the pain and anguish both the abuser and victim must go thru in the wake of a sexual or abusive crime. My wife recommended reading this book on the sexual imagination the heroine's boyfriend used to seduce her. But as i read i felt like i was actually there experiencing the whole ordeal. I talk more to my children now...i wouldn't want anyone to have to go thru such a terrible event in their lives. Beauty isn't just about a black woman, but a woman with alot of heart and guts to stand up and speak out about a very hush-hush topic, child molestation."
4,It's always nice to see realism has not left the art,"Of writing in today's forum of new and up and coming authors, particularly Afro-American authors. This is a great read, and it would be a shame to miss out on Ms. Vay's talent as a realistic storyteller."
2,How many books about the murder of Tut is too many?,"Poor King Tut! His death has now been reenacted in countless novels and at least two television specials. Doherty's book, as another reader has noted, is unscholarly, but in many ways no more so that Bob Brier's very similar book ""The Murder of tutankhamen"", and ""Who Killed King Tut?: Using Modern Forensics to Solve a 3300-Year-Old Mystery"" by Michael R. King, Gregory M. Copper, Don DeNevi, Joann Fletcher, GREGORY M. COOPER. The problem with all of these books is that they stretch the subject matter out to the breaking point, while most of the authors have no direct access to the body of the deceased king."
2,dissapointed in MA,"Although it was great to see women with different body types in this video, I found the video cheesy and outdated. Although I recognized moves from african dance, yoga and tai chi, they were repetitive and done in slow jerky motions without the correct warm-up. It appeared to be a low impact aerobic video from the 1980's with bad new age music in the background and gushy dialogue. Even though the images shown in the background were at times beautiful, I was wondering why they were used. I also tend to prefer my dance meditation tapes to contain less dialogue or be more active(Gabrielle Roth, Dunya, and Nia or just about any belly dance video)."
3,"Flakey story, medicore art, but pivitol all the same","First they say ""Kill Robin"" then they say ""Bring Robin Back"". The story on the whole lacks luster (esp. the ""climax""). The Batman art is typical of it's time (I don't like it, but that's my opinion). Luckily, this takes place across two issues of Teen Titans as well, which offer more appealing work.Get it if you're a die-hard who loves the story, of the art of the time."
1,"Irish Traditional Folk Songs ~ Clancy brothers, hammond","Caution! THis is a cd with mostly David Hammond and only a touch of the Clancy Brothers. Die hard Clancy fans will be disappointed with this purchase. These new releases with David Hammond are misleading due to the headlining of the Clancy Brothers that may only sing 2-3 songs and the rest is the gritty voice of David Hammond. I have been duped into purchasing other CDS that have David Hammond is small print. If you are looking for a great clancy brothers CD, try Tunes and Tales of Ireland."
4,Great for Children,"I love Irish Folk songs and purchased it that for that reason. I didn't know anything about the CD before buying it.This CD is somewhat akin to listening to a gathering in the living room and listening to an Irish family playing some of the Irish classics. Even the kids sing a few songs. It's non-polished and is plain as far as that goes. But, it is from the heart and quite joyful to hear. You'll find yourself singing the songs as you walk around doing your day-to-day activities. The Irish brogue is strong which will fill the heart of anyone who loves the sound of that beloved Irish accent."
4,A Defintion of Postmodernism at Last,"All of us have wondered what postmodernism is but haven't dared to ask. By tracing the career of this noteworthy author we learn about him, his works, and the hows and whys of the present postmodern movement we live in."
5,mothergoose,I received exceptional services from this company--after I inadvertently ordered 2 items! They were very polite and helpful.
5,Simply perfect,"Not only is this flip book sturdy, but it is compact and less bulky looking. I like it's design and sleek materials."
3,It's okay I Guess,"I did not buy this item from here, but to anyone small who is considering buying this plan on altering the outfit to make it fit. I am a small woman 32 24 35 and the small medium is much too loose from the waist up, thankfully I can sew. Also the eye mask is generic and too big for my head in spite of my having a ton of hair. SO I am purchasing a better mask. The hat is really cheap, but hey fro the price not too bad. I got mine for 20.89 so a little work is worth the price. The costume is cute in spite of being made poorly. I can usually count on leg ave to produce a decent costume but this time around things are merely average."
3,Its an ok play...,I bought this play based off the reviews and found it to be just ok. However it arrived at my house in good time and great condition. Id recommend the seller again though.
2,BET,Catch it on BET or you can buy my copy for $3! It was just something to watch and pass the time. Wasn't thunder blasting but not boring either.
5,Getting To Yes,In an easy to follow step-by-step manner the author taught me many effective ways to negotiate toward a win-win solution without focusing on the opposing positions. He has provided much insight to the nature of negotiating as a judge would approach the most equitable solution for all parties involved.
4,"Great, Easy Intro into Negotiation","This book is a great overview of negotiation for the beginner or those interested in improving relationships in general. Advanced management types will most certainly get something from it as well.The information is well-organized and the writing style is extremely accessible. The chapters build on each other logically and you'll get something from this book almost immediately.Great to keep for reference, especially before big meetings. A solid addition to any manager's bookshelf."
5,"Incredibly useful at work/in private life, if you read it!","Must agree with previous reviews. A book worth money and time to read it even for several times. Enjoyable studying literature. Am just about to start reading the sequence ""Getting Past No""."
4,Good guide to negotiations,This is a great beginner's guide to negotiations as it teaches the concepts one needs to internalize to succeed when negotiating.
5,"If you don't read this book, I have the advantage...","This book is clear, concise and easy to understand. An updated approach to the Dale Carnige approach to business interaction, I feel I'm a better communicator for having read it, both in my professional world, and at home.After reading this book, I am more empowered to get what I want with the right approach.For those not interested in reading in, please, work with me."
5,one of the best books i Ever read.,this book is written in plain English but has some very strong ideas and tips.
1,More expensive than book version???,The book is 2x more expensive in digital form than in book version?Ridiculous!
1,KINDLE PRICING ALL WRONG,THE BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY GREATBUT AMAZON NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT KINDLE CUSTOMERS ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT!!! FOR SOME BOOKS IS CHEAPER TO BUY A PAPERBACK COPY THAN THE DIGITAL COPY. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!
1,"Great book, but ridiculous price.","Very good book - 4 stars - but I'm reviewing the Kindle edition, which is $3 more expensive than the paperback. Ridiculous."
2,Not much interesting to read and not very helpful,This book is very boring to read and not helpful. I have read better ones.
3,Packed with Knowledge!,"Authors Roger Fisher, William L. Ury and Bruce M. Patton offer a seminal step-by-step guide to negotiating effectively. The authors use anecdotal examples to illustrate both positive and negative negotiating techniques. They believe that, with principled negotiation, both parties can reach an agreement in an amicable and efficient manner. Principled negotiation is based on the belief that when each side comes to understand the interests of the other, they can jointly create options that are mutually advantageous, resulting in a wise settlement. Since this is the second edition, the authors take the opportunity to answer ten common questions from readers of the first edition. If you become skeptical about these fairly rosy negotiation techniques as you read, the Q and A section is very useful. This classic text is easy to understand and you can implement its techniques immediately. We can't ask for more than that."
2,"A single tape! Content is good, but not a good value","I guess I was expecting more than a single tape for my $10. I think there is probably a lot of good information in the book, but it's hard to tell from a single hour of talk on a single tape. I recommend getting the book and forgetting the tape for this one."
3,"Written for the Student, not the Practitioner","""Getting to Yes"" consists of five basic ideas. One needs only to flip through the book's pages to identify its key elements. I found much of the information in ""Getting to Yes"" to be redundant and obvious. However, I cannot argue that the central ideas are well-supported. In fact, many are over supported with one similar example after another. The fact remains, negotiating is an art that takes years of pracitce to develop. While this book may add value to a scholastic reading assignment, it is very much like a book offering martial arts training. There is no substitute for hands-on experience. Although a quick read, ""Getting to Yes"" could have been summed up in half the pages."
4,Powerful Concepts,"A good primer or review for anyone confounded by negotiating and especially those proned to needing to get past grid lock. Practical advice on how to keep negotiations open and moving. This is not a comprehensive step by step guide to negotiations, but an excellent review or introduction to valuable concepts for the lifelong negotiator."
4,A little book with one gem,"I read this book many years ago, and although most of the information is common sense, I took to heart one strategy, ""Soft on people, tough on issues."" In my negotiations with others over the years, I have employed this strategy religiously to great advantage. I recommend this book to employees who take issues personally."
5,Still very relevent after all these years,"If there is one book you should read on negotiating, it's Getting To Yes. Fisher and Ury provide concise, common sense advice that can be implemented immediately. I've used this book with clients facing difficult negotiations with franchisees, unions or business partners with positive results.There have been countless negotiating books that have come out since the first edition of Getting To Yes. The vast majority don't hold a candle to the principles in this book (with the exception of Shell'sBargaining for Advantage: Negotiation Strategies for Reasonable People 2nd Edition."
4,A must to read,A great book for understanding people and how to respond to stituations in a positive mode. A creative approach for a positive result for all parties.Great information for such a small price. An excellent value.
4,good suggestion,this book was recommended through a management class. so far it looks like what i was expecting.
3,The art of tiating,"The tapes give you useful tips for negotiating. In the most part, however, these are either common sense rules or unoriginal comments based on other works in the field. All in all, the work may be full of information on the subject but I found it hard to go through it all and boring."
2,Boring but Potentially Helpful Guide to Basic Negotiating,"If you are uncomfortable with your current negotiation technique and strategy and seek to improve it, this book will offer you great help. It is comprehensive and easy to read with lots of great examples. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with your current negotiation ability this book will seem repetitive and obvious. The authors make it clear that career negotiators who have read the book agree that it teaches them what they already know, but the negotiators also laud the authors for outlining clearly and in laymen's terms ""The Method"" as they refer to it, even as a refresher. Note that this is not a sales strategy book that will help you get your way by any means, it is a book advocating healthy, relationship friendly negotiation."
1,Good Material / Poor Delivery,"""Getting to Yes"" has many good tidbits of information, but nothing life changing or ground breaking. The information is primarily common sense. Most of the examples in this book are outdated and dull. This book regularly helped me to sleep (even when I wasn't tired). I would not recommend this book."
2,Basic literature,A very basic and even naive book about negotiation. The authors describe a basic approach and probably a very american way to negotiation. Very easy reading....but you pay the price for it. The book lacks insighful and meaningful thoughts on the subject.
3,"Refuse to react, instead sidestep their attack, deflect it against the problem","Look behind their position on the problem at hand and address it. ""why are you... Why do you feel a need to... What exactly are..."" Don't defend, invite criticism abd advice. Ask what's wrong with... What concerns them. Recast personal attacks as an attack on the problem. What can we do now to reach an agreement as quickly as possible? Ask questions and pause. Use questions instead of statements. Statements generate resistance. Q's generate A's. Q's educate. SILENCE IS A GREAT WEAPON. Use it! If unreasonable propsal or an attack- the BEST THING is to sit and not say a thing. If Q'ed wait to answer people are uncomfortable in silence or ask for clarification, then wait. When you ask Q. pause. Silence is the best negotiating."
2,Huh ?,"Tries to hard to say what they wanna say, uses way to many words to say what their trying to convey. Wastes alot of time on jib jab thats irrelevant to getting to the point. Unless your into sitting around listening to alot of usless terminology that serves only to confuse and thats not affilated with the specifics of what this book is supposedly about, do not waste your time with it"
4,Qualified Outline of Negotiation Tactics,"Getting to Yes is a collection of practical negotiation tactics presented in a straightforward and effectual manner. The authors encompass many of the key factors required for any successful negotiation. Much of the advice stems from the notion that understanding the interests of all parties is decisive; and the book focuses primarily on the various aspects of this methodology.There are other books on the topic that incorporate a far more comprehensive examination, provide more samples, or even delve deeper into the psychology of persuasion; however, I have no doubt that if you are seeking to improve your negotiation abilities that this book will be a benefit to you."
4,Getting To Yes - An Education In Negotiating Effectively,"There are many books, articles and seminars on effective negotiation. ""Getting To Yes"" is an easy read that lends itself to practical application in any form of negotiation. For the price of this book there is no better value for learning effective negotiating skills."
1,Missing a disc,"So I get this in the mail and open it up - and low and behold its missing a disc. Thats like ripping out 50 pages from a book and expecting you to follow whats going on.So I tried to contacted the manufactuer... a week later - still no response. Theres no phone number, just a form online.Horrible."
2,This was a required tool.,This was a required teaching tool for a course I took. I am not sure if I liked it or not.
4,"IMMEDIATELY APPLICABLE, A MUST READ",This book is well written and gives food for thought for anybody who is challenged in negotiating and getting agreement. I would consider it a must read for anybody ! Well done.
5,great book to read through about negotiation strategies,"no problem getting the book - it is fairly cheep. A lot of the book is really common sense, but it is good to read through it to realize various strategies that you or others can use to negotiation deals with."
4,Good book to gain knowledge on doing negotiation,"I wasn't about to read the book at all until my Proffesor demanded his students to do the assignment to read and write 10 great ideas about the containts of the book. I found a lot of examples the author uses to imply a negotiation in our life, and especially on business. I haven't finished reading it but planned to do it."
4,Getting to Yes,An very good book detailing steps to take to effectively use interest-based bargaining strategies for your organization. This book is from the leading experts on this topic.
4,"YES, YES ,YES!!!","This is a book that I was required to read as requirement for a college business course, not only does it have tips and guidelines for negotiation in the professional world but great for everyday battles. I recommend it to all age groups although it can be slightly wordy at times. Fisher and Ury bring up manny outlooks that changed how I saw negotiation and conflict, as well as mutual gains instead of compromise this along with building or maintaining relationships are the most promenade themes of the book. The authors stress that you must respect the one that you are negotiating with because most of the time you would like to have a healthy relationship for future negotiations or family, business, ext. Over all I gave this book a 4 out 5 stars because I had great tips and theory but in my opinion it seems that it will only be helpful if both sides are using them. Hopefully I am proven wrong the next time I am negotiating!"
4,Worth the Read!,"This is a very unique read and it was the 1st book I ever read on negotiation. It presents very easy-to-understand examples on why you should look past your own ego's need to ""win"" and why you should instead get the other person to natrally arrive at your understanding. One problem... you need to know how to let go of your ego. Books that can help with that aresomething like God: Six Weeks to Spiritualityand/orThe Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment."
3,Negotiation - Getting to Yes,"Interesting book and it does have some valid doctrine and techniques based on the authors' years of experience. This is one of many recent editions. The only drawback is that there needs to be more examples, recent examples, of where it worked and did not work. It is still a book to read or listen to on CD."
3,Can be useful for endless number of things,This book is a great little book to add some more knowledge to your brain. Helps you become aware of the aspects of persuasion and getting what you want.
4,Excellent negotiation introduction,"It is an excellent book especially if you look for an introduction into the negotiation field. It provides good, real examples. Through this it is easy for the reader to capture the essential statements. One minus is that many examples are not up-to-date dating back to the 60ies and 70ies"
3,More to Negotiating than 'Principled Negotiations',"I have taught this book at the college level, as well as had it in college myself. I would like to add a comment on the context for what the authors term, ""principled negotiations."" They focus on this to the exclusion of many interesting negotiation techniques. Despite the effectiveness of 'principled negotiations' in many - perhaps most - negotiating situations, it leaves at least several interesting and effective techniques unexplored. In fact, my experience with students is that they put all their eggs in this basket, and then can't quite discover why they are not making more progress in their business negotiations. I actually would recommend a number of other books for this purpose, and will do so through Amazon.Negotiation Boot Camp: How to Resolve Conflict, Satisfy Customers, and Make Better DealsThe 50 Best (and worst) Business Deals of All TimeBeyond Reason: Using Emotions as You NegotiateSecrets of Power Negotiating"
4,better than expected,this book was boring at first but the real meat is close to the end. I think this book not only be used on business but also with friends. I've tried using it to talk w/ people and it works. A good read and good asset!
5,A Great Way to Overcome Communications Stalls,"In virtually all circumstances where people are working together, they come to agreement in ways that short-change the interests of everyone involved. This landmark book shows practical ways to find out what other people want, and to devise better alternatives that create a ""win"" for everyone. The authors do a great job of overcoming the preconception that many hold that working on problems means that you have to be unpleasant. The advice to be hard on the problems and easy on the people (building a relationship) is a key concept that everyone can use. I have found this book to be one of the most helpful that I have every read, and I cite its lessons in my own book. I recently had a chance to use these principles in a negotiating workshop with veteran negotiators, and I was struck by how few people apply the lessons of GETTING TO YES. You will vastly improve your life if you read and practice the ideas in GETTING TO YES."
1,"Great Book, Horrid CD",Painfully academic in it's delivery and the staged negotiation scenarios are stilted and slow.Book is a good read and offers some good approaches and negotiating techniques. The audio CD is dull and is an uninspired presentation of good material.
2,Bulldog master,"Fine introduction to bulldog world. Simple, large and colorful photographs, tips, and all things you can find in a breed book. If you can find the edition featuring a DVD, the experience will be better."
3,Okay,It was a good thing. to get this for free. it a good thing that I can use it. I would get again. You should try it today or tomorrow
4,A dehumidifier that eliminated all the mold from our house.,"Worked great in our house that we recently purchased, since our place had damp areas where mold was growing. We got rid of the mold by thoroughly cleaning the area and this dehumidifier helps to keep them from growing back. The UV light works great eliminating bacteria that may lay around our house, keeping our family and our dog healthier."
2,Every once in a while a special product comes along that delights....,"... and this isn't it. It sounds great (Low power consumption, 46-pints-per-24-hours, UV to kill germs and/or mold), but just doesn't perform. Possibly mine was defective, but it ran 24x7 and managed to remove a few pints per day and was never able to get the humidity down to my desired 50%. I wondered why it wasn't EnergyStar rated at only 440 watts for a 46-pint dehumidifier; the answer seems to be because 46 pints is an extreme exaggeration. After replacing this unit with an EnergyStar-rated Frigidaire, I was able to reach my desired humidity level overnight. Better to run a 1000-watt unit on occasion than to run a 440-watt unit 24x7 and not reach your desired result.The other issue is the drain hose output... I tried leveling the unit and shimming it, I was never able to get the water to go anywhere but the removable bucket."
3,Ok for the performance,The dehumidifier works well except the blue light is blinking sometimes. I hope this won't be a big problem later on. It would be nice if I could find this issue listed in the product's manual.
1,Busted Product & Company REFUSED to Resend,"The product arrived and was covered in goo. After determining it was broken, I requested the company send another one to my home address (the original was sent to my work address). Sunpentown refused to send a replacement of the product, even when I said it could be delivered to the original address. I was the object of multiple accusations by the company representative of my breaking the product, along with derogatory comments about me because of my complaint about the broken product. After a week, the company reimbursed the full charge after threatening not to.I bought a Frigidaire 50-Pint Dehumidifier from Lowes, and couldn't be happier."
5,LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!,"It has been about a month since we purchased this and it's working GREAT!!!!!I don't know why some people complaing about this fantastic dehumidifier!!Quiet, easy to operate , awesome price and DOES great job!!!!!Can't be happier!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,decent,"When I first got the product it was raining for a couple weeks straight and also leaking for a couple weeks straight in my basement, and the product didn't really seem to help at the time (humidity was over 75% constantly) even though I ran it almost 24/7. Once it stopped raining the unit still filled up just as fast (roughly every 14-18 hours) and it started lowering the humidity. It has been fairly dry besides scattered thunderstorms the past couple weeks and the humidity is now down to 45%. So for a medium/large sized basement or very leaky basement, you may want to invest in a dehumidifier with a better rate. Overall if you have a decently sealed basement, or a small one/small room this product is great, however; I would recommend getting the additional hose if you will run it constantly, so you don't have to keep dumping the bucket."
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,I thought this soundtrack was surprisingly enjoyable. It had a lot of older tracks that were almost appropriately placed in the movie. The songs they picked are the ones I like hearing on the radio in their rarety and are appropriate for children even though when they were made they targeted adults. It was cool.
2,AWFUL,Omlette that is prepared in this pan is awful. May be I shldnt blame the product but the idea of Omlette in microwave is not tasty.
5,Better than expected!,"Great product!!!To a few times to get timing right. Don't be disappointed at first. It took me about 3 sets to get the timing right. Once you have that down, it great!"
5,Very useful!,"A useful product, especially for people who are in a hurry to make an omlette in a microwave. Grease the pan and pour the beaten eggs, a fuffy omlette is ready in about 2 minutes. Ideal for students in a dorm, office use."
4,Keep it out of the dishwasher,"I've had several of these, and as long as they never see the inside of a dishwasher, they work superbly as non-sick microwave cookers without the need for oil.If you use the dishwasher, you'll need to start cooking with spray oil in order to avoid sticking, and it only gets worse from there."
5,Super-fast omelet,"Wow, an omelet in under 60 seconds. It endured the microwave well. Cheese mixed in seems to fluff the egg up nicely in the microwave. Put in a little non-stick spray first, and it cleans up well too."
1,"No, no, no",This product is cheap and it doesnt work well. What you see is what you get! Not worth it at all !!!!!
4,quick and easy,"the perfect gimick to take to a bachelor, college student or for any cook. Saves turning on the stove. Tip : clean right away after use."
2,Green Eggs,I have tried several times to make an omlet in this dish but I just don't like them. The egg color gets a tinge of green and the texture is odd. I stopped using it.
5,Happy,"Glad to find this old book. Was in good shape and delivered promptly. Fun to read about the old days, adventures & Eskimo's."
4,Excellent Guide!,"I first bought this book because it was so cheap and also that one of my bible study friends in college had it, and we used it occasionally to answer theological questions we came up with. When I joined a different bible study group I started bringing it to those meetings, and it helped us to answer questions a lot, especially with a lot of curious, non-Catholics in the group.The formula is simple: the writer asks a question on anything from marriage to the afterlife, and then explains the answer in clear, easy to read terms. I was able to read through the whole book in one night, and it continued to hold my interest the entire time. The pictures, though somewhat outdated, do provide relief from the text and occasionally aid in explaining it.I continue to use it as my girlfriend and I seriously consider marriage - it helps to answer our questions on the theology side of marriage."
5,Catholic Educators This is a Must,It is great to see this book is available again. Someof the most basic Catholic Teachings seem to get leftbehind in todays - social service age - this bringsback the basics of Catholic Religious education. Great for recent converts who need specific details. Great reference.
4,CATHOLIC CATECHISM,Simple and easy for the new faith in the Catholic Church. Good for teaching the children too.
1,Never thought I can feel such disgust.,"I am not too square, I am not too straight. Cindy Lauper(these two ladies are a bit similar, aren't they?) is OK for me. But this... This song is in rotation on Russian MTV and every time I hear it begin I swith the TV off. To see 40-year old woman squeaking and jumping in teenager's outfit, making girlie faces and trying to break through the TV screen with her silly face makes me so disgusted! The music is idiotic, the lady's house is weirdly furnished, the overall mood is pathetic - the middle-aged woman trying to get in terms with her unattractivenes and the voice of the cartoon squirrel. Anything to jump from obscurity into MTV rotation?"
4,21st CENTURY SIREN,"""2 Times"" has been one of the most addictive hits of year 2000, something like Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" for the 2nd millennium. No wonder it appears on my edition of this CD in no less than 5 versions. The first track is the pure pop radio-friendly version, then there's the similar but uneven Snapshot Remix, the superfast Bulletproof Euro Mix (must be about 200 bpm), the Pumpers Remix that sounds the most like 70s disco in arrangement and vocal style, and finally the Masterboy Club Mix which sounds like late 80s/early 90s house. ""Voices,"" which appears in three versions, is also a hypnotic, catchy number whilst her version of ""Ring My Bell"" (the original of which made Anita Ward and the syndrum famous in 1979) just passes the test. The rest of the songs are pleasant but forgettable. They used to call this Eurodisco, but rarely has voice, synth and drum sounded as sweet as on 2 Times."
5,Can't get it out of my mind!,"While searching for good dance party music, I stumpled upon Ann Lee's ""Voices"" and ""2 Times"". The tunes have simple melody, bubbly yet dancable. The first time hearing it, I figure it was different from the usual house, techno songs, so I didn't give it a second thought. However, something drew me back to itthe next day. And now I can't get it out of my head! You just want to sing the song over and over and hug Ann Lee! Two times! she must be joking, this song ran through my mind all night long.<mind speaking>so many voices....so many voices.."
5,Great Song!,I heard this song all over Europe. It has a great beat. It is a definite must have house beat.
2,I was Tricked!,"Mr. Levine casts himself as a somewhat honorable person in this book. When forced by the SEC to implicate others in insider trading he states he was emotionally devastated but grudgingly complied. He claims his attorney, in 30 years of practice, never witnessed a defendant become so emotional with betraying his work associates.Hold the presses.On page 311 of ""Den of Thieves"" another perspective emerges: ""Despite his claims to Wilkis that he'd never cooperate, Levine seemed eager to ensare his fellow conspirators.""This is just one example of Levine's revisionist history. Instead of reading this book, read ""Den of Thieves."""
1,What a mislabeled rip!,This tape doesn't have anything to do with dancing or meditation. It's just a short tape of some basic floor exercises like stomac crunches. I can't figure out why they would totally misrepresent this product.
1,Disappointing,"The film was great, but the music, which seemed to fit the film so nicely, just doesn't hold up well on the CD. Save your money for the DVD or something more interesting than this overly emotional East-West hogwash."
4,Riveting drama,"Mitch Grobeson was the first openly gay officer with the Los Angeles Police Department and was eventually harrassed off the force. In this fictional work, Grobeson skillfully combines imaginary characters with real-life past experiences to weave a compelling story of indiscriminate torture-killings of LA street hustlers and the LAPD's refusal to pursue the killer. Grobeson is not a professional novelist, but he manages to intertwine many of his experiences as an LAPD officer with fiction to create a book that one hesitates to put down."
2,Disappointment!,"Although there are some interesting insights into the workings of the LAPD, the main character is annoyingly goody two-shoes. I can see why other cops would hate him. Yet everyone else, including gang members, just loves him! And the character is asexual, not homosexual. We never get a sense of his desires, so we never understand why he can't just play it straight.The sex in the book is twisted and disgusting, I guess a reflection of the author's self-hatred. Plus, to top it off, the last chapter is a gratuitous bashing of life in LA in general, with San Francisco being the only place for a gay person to live. That's been done, and this guy's view of life in LA is tragically warped. The author just comes off as tired and bitter, an iceberg who was unsuccessful at finding someone ""just to hold him""."
4,So warm.,"I never realized how warm these things can get. The only down side to this product is that it is easily torn, but it does keep your body warm in those days. Well another downside is if you are afraid of how you look with it on, yeah.. not the best sight out there, but hey, staying warm is a lot better than looking good and being cold, or is it?"
4,They are....,"They are what they are. A way to help contain body heat when patiently waiting for someone to get their errands done, which takes ""forever"" at times. And, I save gas by not running the car engine while I wait."
4,emergency,"is a product of excellent quality and durability, I recommend to fill the demands and expectations required by my very good"
5,You never know!,"I saw these when I was ordering something else, and they were such a good buy I could not pass them up. You never know when you may get into a situation where you may be stranded somewhere in poor weather conditions. it never hurts to be prepared, and at this price it was a no brainer. They arrived quickly and as advertised. get em now, don't wait."
5,package arrived,"This is exactly as ordered and was fast arrival. We were not expecting for days and it arrived in just a few days, which is beyond awesome."
4,EMERGENCY means EMERGENCY,I only used a simular item once (while in the military) i bought these and put one in each car trunk and with the hunting and camping gear. Hope I never have to use them. Can not speak on quality of item but they were shipped quickly and matched the description posted.
5,Good product,"I use these in my vehicle emergency and backpacking supplies... but I mostly use them to put in ziplock bags filled with some necessities and some comfort that I hand out to the homeless. I call them ""Blessing Bags"" and include things like these blankets to keep them warm or give them shelter. It gets cold up here and it is not uncommon to read about a homeless person who died of exposure during the night. The blankets are small and nicely contained. The cost is great and the product is handy for sure!"
2,Emer Bivy is better,"I bought this because I liked the size, weight and cost. I end up having several different types. Each quarter I review what is in my basic overnight pack, which is a single strap over the shoulder. I have replaced these with Adventure medical kits 8.5 ounce Bivy. Much more expensive; but for the weight and size it offers much more capability. i would not buy these again."
5,Works great,"My apartment in Las Vegas faces West. When the sun sets, the heat is very intense. I used these mylar blankets in my window as poormans insulation. Now my air conditioner does not run constantly and I am able to leave it off during the day when I am not home. Without the blanket and my A/C off, my apartment would reach 90F by 8pm. With the blanket, it stays about 78F.You get a bunch of these blankets, and they are very large. I would recommend these as both poorman window insulation and as an emergency blanket."
4,HAVEN'T OPENED ONE YET,"THEY SEEM TO BE SIMILAR TO WHAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST, WHICH I AM HAPPY WITH. THESE WERE ABOUT 1/3 OF WHAT I PAID BEFORE. SO FAR I'M HAPPY"
5,Works great,Ordered these to line my indoor garden and I'm more than pleased! I will keep my nice warm wool blanket in my go bag!
4,Useful Mylar Blanket,I purchased the Thermal Blankets for the material. The Mylar can be glued to just about anything with spray glue and provides a very shiney surface. Of course they are sold as emergency blankets and I have no doubt they will work well for the purpose. What I don't know is how well the mylar will hold up to sun exposure over a period of years.
5,"works well, more so than what I expected","worth the money to have these around, packing these babies in my bag as I type. If your reading this, get some while your thinking about it."
4,Fun,Immediately opened one when we received the package and tried it out. Does what it says it will do- must have for a car safety kit. Also fun to play with:-)
5,Very happy with the package,I received the package was indeed a package of 10. The dimensions are the same as other emergency blankets I've ordered but to my pleasant surprise the individual packages are folded smaller. I like this as it is easier to find room in an EDC or BOB or in the vehicle GHB. Very pleased with this product and price.
4,Bang for the Buck,"First off you get 10!. Second they are of good quality. Third good luck repacking one! They seem to grow when unpacked like a map. This is a fine layer but don't expect that wool blanket feel, great to cut up and put in boots and headgear and as a vest under clothes, cut a square and inset foot in boot and so on for that extra layer, water resistant well as much as a plastic bag and I have done that also. Much better than nothing! But think layers, wind block, reflector, sun block (for shade) and so on.Duct tape and cordage a must to get full effect of options.I would say ground cloth but only as a layer over leaves or something as it is very thin and no insulating value.Good survival mirror! You get the idea. Kind of small for a shelter but it could work somewhat as tarp."
5,These are what they are - and hope to never need them,"Used these as part of a survival kit. They are your typical foil blanket to be used in emergency situations. I hope to never have to use them, but am glad they are there."
3,"Small, Lightweight","These are small and lightweight...perfect for your glovebox or emergency kit. I have not used one yet, so can't comment on their integrity. Should be less expensive in my opinion. Still, rather have and not need than need and not have!"
1,not blanket,false advertisement man.. its a film not blanket.. rips like toilet paperman so sad i wasted my hard workin earned money on it
3,acceptable cheap,Functional plastic sheet. Its a disposable item and should keep the heat in. Great to have in the Glove box just in case.
5,Great!,"These are awesome little blankets. I have it for camping and emergencies; keep some in the trunk and If you break down, you'll be warm."
3,Arrived as adverised,"Bought these for my family in case of an emergency where we lose gas and electricity. Haven't tried them, yet, but they seem as good as any in the stores."
4,Back ups,"They are just as described. Arrived fast & a good value to add to multiple bags or kits. Remember, these are a one time use item. You can be the utmost careful person and perhaps get two uses, but tgey are super thin and prone to tear or split."
5,Keeps you warm,I used this for making up the inside of an outdoor cat house for some stray cats that show up in my backyard. The material does keep you warm. Its the same material that are given to marathon runners after a race to keep warm. The sheets are huge and each package has 10. Great product.
3,Not survival material,"When you buy something for survival remember the circumstances under which you expect to HAVE to use it. A cheap ""survival knife"" is just plain stupid. I bought these to use in disposal conditions like ground sheet or to cover gear. they are fine for that. I did use one as a ground sheet under a gortex bivy sack and it is definitely good for almost one use. The snow and ice wore the silver finish off and made it clear in most areas. It was slippery which is to be expected but did keep the bottom of the bivy sack clean.Item arrived as expected and before the estimated due date."
5,Looks like a Mylar Blanket,I honestly got exactly what I expected! This item will go great in the trunk of my car and in my emergency kit
5,Exactly what your looking for,"Not gunman lie, these are just what they say they are. However buying a ten pack is probably the smart way to go. You never know when anything bad will happen. To stay warm these van be essential. In the cold weather for anyone with a lust for the outdoors, carry at least one. We took one out and it is definately a good size. I put them in all my camping bags and hunting gear. JUST IN CASE! Lol, buy them today. Its already 2012."
2,thin blankets,"These are very thin. Afraid to open one up as it might rip. Disappointed in the quality, really expected something a little more durable."
4,good value blankets,"I got these for my emergency kit for my car, over all they a good value. They are a bit on the cheap side but for what you pay they more than get the job done."
3,Necessary but nothing special,"I keep these things everywhere, in my bag, jeep, first aid kit. They're useful for all sorts of situations (ever have your car not start in a mall parking lot at 10pm on a Tuesday in winter?) They're cheap and can keep you warm when you really need it. I like they bulk package because I can throw these in my parents' cars, or to whoever might need one and not really have to worry about replacing them one at a time."
1,NOT what I ordered,"I ordered 2 packages of 10 ""emergency mylar thermal blankets"". When I got the package, there were 2 individual mylar blankets... not 2 orders of 10."
4,small and fits right into my emergency back pack,"Arrived quickly, is light weight and fits easily into my emergency backpack. My only concern is it might tear easily."
3,Disposable Mylar Blankets,"What I received was 10 mylar blankets in plastic bags. The blankets fold into a 3"" by 4"" by 1/4"" package and are in 10 small zip-lock-style plastic bags. Each unfolds to the full size (roughly 80"" by 50""). The mylar is silvered. It is extremely thin and fragile. It is very easy to tear even accidentally. It wasn't possible for me to re-fold the blanket small enough to fit back into the small plastic bag.These might be useful for hiking with a backpack or some other situation where reduced weight and size are paramount, however they need to be considered disposable because they are so fragile. I recommend instead an all-weather blanket."
5,Individually packed,"These were a great deal. Put 3 in the wifes car, one in the MIL car, 2 in mine, and 4 in the BOB. They feel durable and were priced very affordably to possibly save your life."
5,Can't go wrong.,For less than $10 you get 10 blankets for emergency use. Doesn't matter if they suck because they were less than a dollar a piece. Haven't gotten a chance to use them but they look promising.
4,Cost-effective aid for tent camping,"I plan to use these to place between the inflatable mattress and my sleeping bag while tent camping to reflect my body heat upwards. The idea here is to help insulate me from the cold air that will be in the mattress. The mattress air is chilled by its proximity to the cold ground. We'll see what happens in a supplemental review in the future.These are very thin sheets, and have no backing pad. They appear to be completely reversible, so there is no top or bottom to them."
3,Good to have a few on hand in the winter months in case you get stranded.,I have used similar products in the past and they really do work - keep them on hand in the car or truck.
2,Only received 9 blankets...,"I suppose these are ok (I haven't used them) however, I only received 9 of the 10 and they aren't in a 'pack' they are just thrown into a box individually."
5,Item as pictured.,"Item as pictured, very good packaged, 10 packs received. I cut this product few pieces and inserted into my ski boots. I will test tomorrow.This product is very effective for emergency use.I RECOMMEND THIS SELLER AND PRODUCT..."
2,Product not as advertised!,"Product specifications list these as 52 inches x 84 inches. I just received my order and they are labeled as 82 inches. If size matters, and it does, this item comes up short."
4,good value,I am making up emergency kits for all my vehicles. I hope I never have to use these but for less than a buck a piece you can’t go wrong.
5,Great for Emergency Kits,"Added a couple of these Mylar Blankets into my Emergency Kits for the house and car.Great price, only need them to work once."
4,Emergency blankets,Just recieved this by mail and will store it for use in the event of an emergency. Product was as advertised and construction is solid. Hope I never need this but I feel better knowing I have some on hand.
4,good price for a mediocre product,"this is a great price for such a bulk haul of emergency blankets. however you get what you pay for, they are EASILY torn especially in the bush but if you need to cover your shelter or wrap up for one time use its great, i always keep one in my bag."
4,Just what I needed,"I bought these to put in my family's survival bags. No emergency has come up (thank goodness!), so I have not had to use one yet, so I can't say if they work or not. That's why I gave 4 stars and not 5. You certainly can't beat the price. Must have item for anyone packing a survival/bug-out/emergency bag!"
1,were is the other 9?,the item is really good but in the desciption say is a pack of 10 i just recieve 1 blanket so were is my other 9 blankets plus i wait like a month to recieve this
4,useful in those odd instances,"I am a do-it yourselfer. When something quits and needs a little repair, I get to it. The other day my Swiffer WetJet wouldn;t pump fluid so I wanted to fix the problem. I ran into a problem right off. The handle had security torx screws. Odd place for them on a handle. Well that lead me to look for some bits. This set was the answer and the price was in line with what I needed for this one time fix, i.e. less than a new mop."
5,"Accidental Buy, but worth every penny","I bought this kit for working with computers, only to find out that it didn't have the correct size for any of the bits. With this being said, the tool kit is quite beneficial for everything else (that is larger scale). I have used the tool kit for repairs at home (doors), at pools (fixing our pump) and various different environments and it passes with flying color."
4,Decent set,"This is a decent set, although some of the bits are loose in the plastic case, which feels cheeply made. Also, a couple of the secuirty holes in the bits are slightly off centered."
4,yeah,As advertised: Items were shipped quickly and packed properly. I would buy them again or would suggest to others their purchase.
2,Poor Quality,"I recently bought this item from Amazon in order to remove the battery in my Macbook Pro. According multiple sites I needed a Y1 bit to do this. When I got this item the Y1 bit did not fit the Y1 screw. I believe this was because the tip did not come to as fine of a point as it should have.Even if I was mistaken about the screw, I would still not recommend this set. As others mentioned the bits are not good quality. The metal seems of poor quality, the security torx bits are drilled off center, the bits do not stay in place in the case while it is closed, and there is no place to put the screwdriver."
2,It's Ok...But Look for something better.,"Nice case, but as you can see there is no spot for the ratchet driver, and no handle for case. Although the case is not that big. The ""Specialty"" bits only go down to a T7 level, which was disapointing. They should have eliminated the flat heads/hex/phillips tips to accomadate for T1-T6 ( smaller heads for the specialty bits. You will not be able to use this set/case of bits for Cell phones or most newer small electonics. There were no Triangle bits."
2,not 4 Wii,"if you are trying to use the Tri-Wing screwdriver to Open Your Nintendo Wii, please do not Buy it... but if your reason is different, i will recommended to buy.."
3,"Good for around the house, but not for electronics","This set has a decent variety of hex bits, regular flat and fillips heads, and some others. It was disappointing that the sizes don't go down low enough for electronics, like cell phones or the PS3. I like having the huge variety of hex bits because a lot of baby furniture is built in our house and that is a must have. I like the screw driver handle and the extensions that come with the case, however I would have preferred to have a place in the case for the handle. I'm notorious for losing tools and this will probably be one of them, with no place to store it."
5,Click To Win: Clicker Training for the Show Ring,"I just received the new book by Karen Pryor, Click to Win! It's great! It's about clicker training dogs for the show ring, but everything in there can be applied to horses. It's very concise and gives lists of Tips for Getting Started, Targeting, Getting Rid of Unwanted Behaviors, Shaping, etc. I love the part where she talks about judging and all things being equal, showmanship can win the ribbon. You can teach your dog to take the stack on his own and then give the judge an ""adoring"" look. Too cool! My favorite part was about breeders who are clicker training their litters from birth. Some breeders offer replacement guarantees for animals that don't work out. The breeders who are CT'ing litters and offering replacement guarantees have had their replacement numbers dropped to zero!"
3,There are better options,"First off let me say that I have a great deal of respect for Karen Pryor. I own her amazing video, Clicker Magic, and have read Don't Shoot the Dog along with many of her articles about animal training. I admire her greatly. She writes with a healthy sense of humor, and her advice is always sound.However, this book was a great disappointment to me. Although the articles are interesting, the training instruction is very broad. I had hoped for more specific information. If you are just starting out using a clicker to train, your money would be better spent on the above titles from Karen Pryor. I also recommend videos and books by Gary Wilkes."
1,MR,This book was one of the most uninformal book what i read about dog handling.It gives a some information(for beginners) but if you have an advantage thisbook doesent says so much to you.
4,Great item: great price.,"This plug works everywhere I go; Europe, UK, Kuwait, India, Etc. Contrary to some reviews I read, You Can plug in a standart US plug and a USB cable into this plug and power both at the same time. It come in handy even in the US at an airport when the outlets are all being used because I can plug in my iPhone via the USB and the original persons device via the regular plug thus using it as a splitter. The only thing that would make it better is if there were no removable part; if it was designed where the pins slid out to adapt via a slide lever as in some other models; however I have not found such a model that also has a USB that can be used at the same time as the standard outlet."
2,Interesting Idea But...,"As other reviewers have said, this is too bulky to use for trips to a single country unless you plan to use it as a surge protector, which this allegedly does and is why I bought it.My solution is to slip off the front part, with the plugs, and just take the back and whatever adapter I need. HOWEVER the American plug from my Sony eReader will NOT fit into the holes available, which makes this pretty useless.And, as another reviewer pointed out, it doesn't work with European outlets which require a ground. Off to look for other options..."
5,Great!,Works everywhere except South Africa. I took it to 40 countries on six continents and the only place I had to buy an adaptor was South Africa. Other than that it worked world-wide. It lasted for 8 months of travel and I still use it back in the US to charge USB things.
1,Product does not work after a few months of use,"The warranty only lasts 30 days which is understandable, but I did not expect this product to lose function after a few months of (normal) use. I have never had a travel adapter with such terrible durability, and highly encourage everyone to invest in better products that will last longer than a few months."
1,This item is not an adapter,I needed an apapter that I could take my American hair dryer and use in Europe the maker of this product assured me it would work. I have now returned from Europe and I can SAY IT DID NOT WORK. And I had to wear a hat the whole time to cover my hair
3,Poorly written,"I've used this book in some of my Reiki training classes, and though the information is good, it is badly in need of editing. I've also learned, since reading some of Frank Arjava Petter's books, that Mitchell's history of Reiki is not entirely accurate.It is amateurishly written and edited, though I have found much of the information useful."
4,"Great slice of unique ""indie"" when that meant something","Eclectic, wonderful album with enough ideas to keep you going to the end. This album is up there with Thinking Fellers Union, Pavement and other weird unique American bands from the early 90's that seem to have been completely forgotten."
5,She Goes the Distance,"There are few poets out there who really go the distance it takes to write something edgy, something rock n' roll. Patti Smith achieves this with every phrase she utters. Seventh Heaven was such a great foreshadow at the future she had ahead of her long before she ever became a rock star. The most interesting aspect of this collection of poems could be her use of gender. In some poems like ""Girl Trouble,"" she basically writes as a male. In others, she describes all the pains involved with being female.Patti Smith is so in touch with icons that she creates perfect pictures of Marianne Faithfull, Edie Sedgwick and others through her poetry. This is a poetry book you can pick up and read over and over again. It haunts you and it stays with you. Patti Smith has been instrumental in creating a new type of poetry that is rock n' roll. Seventh Heaven is the perfect introduction to her writings and music."
4,"Well written. Unlike Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, NKOTB, etc.","One of the best CD i have pick up in Europe just recently. They are much much better than and even sound better than Backstreet Boys, N'Sync. These boys are more mature and much more talented than the above mention. Look out for these guys when they hit USA. Take note Guys!"
4,"watch out for these guys, the next best thing in Pop!","westlife is one of the boybands which truly caught my attention. they are not just any band, they've got talent (and good looks too). this album is their debut and i will sure capture your heart. swear it again is great. you'll also love their rendition of forever."
3,Nvval ships,This is a great reference book for naval buffs it provides information on vessels going back in time to the 1990's maybe this will be updated in a later publication
5,"AWSOME, HIGHLY INSPIRING, REAL PUNK ROCK FOR REAL PUNX","UNDERSTAND has always been a big fave in my book. This is the real deal here. Fat chunky guitar chords interlaced with powerful yet melodic vocals. Pure punk here folks. It's not pop, but it has has some good pop hooks going on. Personal fave is ""Never Follow"". The ultimate punk anthem recently covered by ""riotgun."", So. Cal's answer to Naked Raygun. True fans of the movement will love this release."
5,Brings back some old memories!,"Raygun always put on an amazing live show, lots of energy and spirit. Listening to the CD makes me weepy for those days again. Raygun is certainly at the head of the punk band class. Great stuff that stands the test of time. If you want music that rocks and just makes you feel good, this is the band(and one of the albums)for the job!"
5,A Writing Bible,"This book was everything I could have wanted; it is comprehensive in its listing of genres, forms, poetry devices and history, and has some good psychological pointers about the writer's life and the need to allow yourself solitude and time away from workshop madness. Its lists of books to read while writing, before writing and just plain writing literacy are superb, and its ""writing challenges"" (exercises for writing poems when you're stumped) are super. I'm working my way through them, day by day."
5,A text for our times,"In our age of ""sex positive"" this has become a crucial read for anyone who desires social change which will actally improve our situation."
1,0 Stars would be more accurate,"I bought this cutter at an office supply store. The blade doesn't cut through photo stock paper at all. Much worse, it literally fell apart the first time I used it... Seriously fell to pieces! I'm going back to Fiskars cutters."
5,Great purchase!,"After buying and returning the Evenflo version of this product, I feel the need to write this review. Love it! Easy to install, open and close, but keeps toddler out. It really stays open if you open it all the way, and it swings close if you don't. Looks nice compared to other gates, also."
5,Best features in this price range.,"We bought this gate initially to keep our pets out of the bathroom, and are going to be buying a couple more for our baby.While initially ""bent"" when it comes out of the package, this is not a defect. There is a bit of a spring effect that gives this gate a pressure fit inside a door frame. Once the ends are properly adjusted (and the included wrench lets you tighten it very well), the latch lines up and the swinging gate works perfectly.At this price (~$36) I have not found a better equivalent product anywhere. We've had it for almost a year, opening it dozens of times a day, and it is holding up very well."
4,We love it,We had a different brand before purchasing this North States gate and hated it. This one installs VERY VERY easy and fit our space perfectly. It has fallen due to our son putting to much pressure on it before so make sure you aren't planning on using it for a stairwell.
5,Great Dog Barrier,I got this to keep my little dog contained when I want to open the door for a breeze. And it works great. Installation was a little tricky - lots of pieces to put together. But it's nice & sturdy now
5,Super easy to install and use,"Very easy to install and use. First, read the instructions! You will need to make sure how to attach the extension(s) to the gate. The orientation is important. When you are assembling the gate, lay it out on a flat surface with plenty of working room. Then, move it to your designated location. It helps to have a 2nd person but not required. One person can hold the gate in place while the other adjusts the tension. As the instructions state, don't make the door closure too tight or too loose."
1,SUPERGATE -- NOT,"Description and reviews do not fit the product I received. I have made do with nylon cord and a menswear tie. The mechanism for closing gate does not work. It also seems that the sides of the room entrance where this thing is to be used are not plumb (opening measures the same but WTH) so it is difficult to fit gate tightly. One of the extensions comes loose at the bottom. The cord secures the wayward extension, and the tie works at the top for the so-called latch. I've put together Home Decorators and Ikea furniture with less frustration and better results. Since this is to be used as a pet gate rather than for children, I will keep it but do not recommend it."
2,shug1,"Just not what we were hoping for. We need a barrier for the top of our steps. To be used between a wall and a wood banister. Not a good product for that, possibly for an area with two flat surfaces it would work okay.Too many parts, takes two people to assemble and fix into the area where it was to be used.Very upset, we really thought this was the answer for our 9 month old granddaughter to protect her from the stairs.We returned the product and will continue to look for a replacement.Sorry Supergate."
1,not so hot,"I dislike this gate. hard to install and to adjust - not really a pressure gate - needs to be screwed into the wall, noisy.Get the Regalo easy close instead."
1,Do not buy!,I purchased this gate and appeared it to be okay even though the box was damaged during shipping. It was not shipped in outer box. I just got around to trying to install it because we just moved. Today I noticed the gate did not meet the clasp that allows it to close and secure children inside. It looked good but there was some error. Go to store to buy a gate at least you will not have to experience the disappoint that I did.
5,Supergate,"Easy to set up. Gates swings both ways with a slight downware pressure to release. Automaticly swings closed if you don't swing it all the way, otherwise it stays open. I love this gate, but I don't think my dog likes it because he can't get into my room anymore and chew my books and papers."
4,Inexpensive Baby Gate- Does the trick,"We purchased this gate after reading a ton of reviews and finding this to be fairly inexpensive and highly rated.The gate serves its purpose, for now, but my son is only 10 months old. One of the problems is that the bottom locking mechanism stopped lining up...so it's really only locked at the top.I'm afraid that once he starts to push the gate harder, this may cause a problem. But overall we are pleased with the gate and the functionality.For now, we can sit and relax without having to worry about him venturing off into the other parts of the house.I just hope it stands the test of time...and his weight as he gets stonger!"
5,Great buy,"The gate works well, though our toddler doesn't like to be separated from the kitchen. However, we do not want her to get hurt while we are cooking. This gate works really well. Easy to put to use and no drilling required as we live in an apt."
5,A great purchase,"I love these gates. We bought two for my son's house and one for mine and I am going to order another for my house. They are very sturdy, decent looking and installed easily and easy to use. Perfect to keep my pups corralled. And, received in 3 days!"
4,Great gate but a little hard to open,"This is a sturdy and attractive gate. The latch is a little harder to open than other gates I've used but worth it for it's sturdiness. I had a different gate that was so easy to open that my toddler could do it....that defeats the purpose. We use this gate to block a doorway. It't the perfect height because it stops just below the door knob so we can still close the door. Supergate makes an extra tall version of this gate that is tall enough to get in the way of the door knob so keep that in mind if you are using it in a doorway. A nice feature is that this gate swings open both ways which is very convenient. It will swing closed on it's own if opened just a bit but can be kept open if you push it all the way. Overall, I would definitely recommend this gate."
4,Great well designed and well made baby gate,Great baby gate. Did not come with parts bag but called the company and they quickly sent parts bag. Good company to work with. Very pleased with gate and transacdtion. Would have received 5 stars if all parts had been shipped in original box.
5,Great product great price,Read the reviews before I purchased this gate for my 14 month old. This is a great gate at a great price! I love how the door can be left open if desired.
5,Great product,"Great quality, great looking, work so well, ship fast, will buy it again, really love it, it's good for puppies"
4,It IS super easy to close...,"but it's also kind of loud, in a ""clanging"" manner, when it does so, not a good choice for a household in need of quiet.The side extensions leave a wider space between bars than the main section, so our Pomeranian can slip through, & we had to use cord wrapped 4-5 times top to bottom to fill in the gap to stop her.Otherwise it's great, fits our strairway and holds up against our marauding Shiba Inu & Pomeranian hooligans."
5,Baby gate,"Actually my daughter loves it. It does exactly what is needed, where it is needed. Easily keeps my granddaughter safely out of harm's way."
2,"""No Assembly Required"" completely misleading","30 minutes later the gate is up and relatively functional, but we chose this gate among the countless highly reviewed choices on amazon based solely on the distinguishing factor of ""no assembly required."" Not only was assembly required, the instructions are a cross between Greek and a fighter jet instruction manual.Also, the tightening process on the tension mounts is really awkward, and the success of actually opening the gate and walking thru it is based on the tightening process; once we thought we had the right tightness, the actual opening action felt shoddy, and there's definitely concern over time the thin plastic at the opening hinge will wear down."
5,"Strong and Functional, holds up well.","Our family uses this gate to barrier off our dogs from certain areas of the house if we are not able to watch them in that area. The installation of this gate was a bit slower than I expected because of interference with the trim at the base of my walls but still installed relatively easily. Following installation I have zero complaints about this gate. It is extremely sturdy, the auto open/close cam feature is phenomenal, and the locking mechanism works very well."
4,Good but previously opened,"The gate is great! I installed immediately upon arrival and my son (almost 13 months old) is having fun with it, both open and closed!How ever, the product came to us previously opened already. The plastic cuffs holding the gate together were all cut off, but the box containing the additional items looks unopened. I'm guessing someone returned it previously and the company just turned around and sold it back without checking."
4,Very Nice Gate!,"This gate was very easy for my husband to install and it looks nice. I love the fact that this gate is strong and swings both ways. It will close behind you or you can push it all the way to stay open. In less than 24 hours, our 17 month old son figured out how to unlatch the gate and laughed at my husband! My husband tighten the tension for swinging door so now we just have to press a little harder to open the gate, which I don't mind since now my little bam-bam isn't quite strong enough to get through it right now, but he still tries. :) My husband was impressed with the quality of the gate, so we will buy this same gate for the bottom of the stairs. Money well spent and at good price here on amazon with 1-click shipping!"
5,Nice solid gate,"I accidentally destroyed the gate to my son's room and needed another. The previous gate was purchased at a ""big box"" baby store. It was MUCH flimsier (is that a word)than this one. This is built really well. It takes about five uses to get used to the latch, but no worries there. It closes very securely. The hold open feature is great when carrying laundry or bengal tigers in to my son's room."
5,Wonderful product,"WOW, I was soooo surprised when UPS drove up today and delivered my 3 gates, I had thought I would not get delivery before the 15th of this month.Purchased them to keep my beautiful 3 month old Shih Tzu puppy safe and sound. Two for my deck that she so loves playing on and one to keep her out of my kitchen. I am more than pleased with the gates. Very easy to assemble the construction is great, and they are attractive. I have to retro fit one of the gates for the deck, but not due to the gate design, but rather due to the siding on my home and the fact that I do not have a post on the siding side of the stairway.I had purchased a different companies gate at a local store. I am usually pretty handy, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to put it together, no to mention the construction is poor at best."
1,get bent,"The gate came bent ever so slightly, but enough that it could not close. Wish I had figured that out before I installed the thing. Of course, Amazon refunded my money easily."
5,Coming Back for Another,"Normally I would ask, ""why bother to write a review about a gate?"" This one deserves the time it takes.I bought this gate for the foot of my stairs to keep my Westie puppy from going into the bedrooms. My original concern was the bar width. Not to worry - Gracie is 12 lbs of wiggle and the bar width would be good for a Yorkie.I now need to buy another for the mudroom - the cat box is just too interesting. It would be nice if they made a lower version of this so that small dogs were kept out but cats could jump it easily. As my cat gets older the height might be a concern, but for now he will be OK.If I have to live with pet gates, this one is nice looking and very well made. My husband was very surprised that it was so solid. I would not hesitate to recommend this product, and I'm picky."
4,A little tricky to install,"At first, it was tricky to understand, because I am not tech inclined. I did figure it out and installed it easily, though.."
4,Great Gate,"Love this gate, feels sturdy and it's a nice color. The gate can be left open or will automatically close after you, which is good as other gates I've bought didn't have this capability. And, as a parent of a toddler, I like this as a safety feature. I've bought a couple of kinds of metal gates and this one is the best. The bronze color is great with wood trim."
5,Great gate!,"Very sturdy, easy to install and operate. Fits a wide range of doors with the included extension pieces. Opens, swings back into place and locks firmly, or if you open it wide enough, it stays open for easy walk through."
3,"it works, but not the easiest.","We have several different types of gates in the house for our dogs and soon to be baby and this one does work, but it is not the easiest to open unless both hands are free. I would recommend you use it for a place that you won't be using all that much."
5,Great gates,"We purchased two of these gates to confine our new puppy to our kitchen. They worked so well, we ordered another for the days I bring her to my office. They can be left open or easily, automatically swing closed. Easy to fit into a doorway too."
5,Excellent,Fits perfectly without having to make holes in the walls. Great price and double locking system to stop kids once they get a little smart! Ability to open with one hand is also a big plus
5,Best gate I have ever owned,"We have been through 3 different gates. Some would not hold and would be easily knocked down by my 1 year old and my Lab, others were just cheap.This gate is awesome and secure. Great holding power and it does not make marks on the wall! I have 2, one at the top and one at the bottom of the stairwell. They have a great lock function and are easily opened one handed with your baby in hand."
4,Great buy!,"We bought this gate for two reasons - 1. we have a baby who will walk soon. 2. We just got a puppy for said baby. Both need to be contained. We got the bronze color gate and it looks very nice in our home aside from being sturdy and well built. The door swings smoothly, everything works as intended. My only issues with this gate is that the latch was a little difficult at first, but it seems to have loosened up a bit and got easier to open after about a day of use. I also wish there was more door space to go through. The side rails are a little wide, making the door a bit narrow for my liking. I do, however, LOVE that it swings both directions and auto locks. Great feature. I also like the fact that you can leave it open; just open it up all the way and it stays. Overall, I really do like it. It works like we hoped and was well priced. I would definitely buy again."
3,gate,works well my only complaint is that that there should be some type of method where there is nothing going along the bottom to each side as many timjes i have tripped
4,Great product,"I was frustrating with the other kind of gates but when i purchase this one i was very happy , easy to install, both ways opening left and right .Happy mommy ."
5,These gates were perfect!,"I ordered these gates to keep my dogs out of certain areas of our home and they are perfect. The door on it is great! No jumping over a gate, lol."
4,Great Puppy Gate,"Sturdy--quality metal construction. Easy to install if you just read the directions first. It will square up as you tighten the knobs. I am using this without installing the cups permanently into the woodwork, though it is recommended, and I am having no issues with operation or safety. The 'stay open' feature is nice. I'm just a few calories short of 300 lbs and I have no trouble going through the gate opening. Keeps a 12 week old Lab puppy where it belongs, but does not keep it isolated like a shut door, which is why I bought it. Only reason it is not 5* is that I would prefer it to be several inches taller."
5,"Great baby gate, easy to install",This is a great pressure gate and very easy to install. Bought this to keep my 9 month old in our family room. I like the feature which allows for the gate to swing both ways. The gate will also hold open when you don't need to have it shut. I purchased another baby gate brand and now wish I would have just bought this one.
4,Very good purchase,"We bought this 2 years ago to provide more humidity in our home during our cold, dry Winters. A full 8 gallons lasts more than the sleeping ours and then some depending on the settings. This has been totally reliable, is easy to clean, filter replacements are cheap and has done so for about 2 years so far."
2,Unreliable but great when it works,"I have bought this at Lowes as well 3 weeks ago and exchanged it today for another one. I worked great for 2 weeks. Used filtered water but slowly started to not deliver the same humidity level. Even after the cleaning in 2nd week as recommended, it still didn't change the fact that it finally wasn't producing any steam this past week. Today I have a new one again from Lowes. It already used it all of the water in 4 hours and works great. Let's see how often I will have to replace these.Wonderful when it works - think it's hit or miss. Keep your receipts for returns, warranties."
5,Excellent Product - Quality Built,This item is sturdy and works perfectly. Its stainless steel construction will last for many years. It fits multiple pots and strains efficiently.
5,Quality Strainer,"I have used this strainer several times and it works well. Additionally, it doesn't rust in the dishwasher. I have had to use a towel around it when draining hot water as it heats up quickly around a hot pan. All in all it is a good product and I would recommend it."
4,An imaginative adventure in our magical prehistory,"Set in a time when the Sahara grew green and a world where shamanic powers and demons are real, The Leopard's Daughter tells the story of Jeneba, a girl born to a human mother and leopard-man father. Her search for justice and acceptance takes her across a prehistoric world full of diverse tribes, strange magics, and other long-lost wonders. As she learns to accept her unique origins and gifts, she meets several interesting characters struggling with their own problems. With so many pseudo-medieval European fantasies retelling the ""chosen boy saves the world"" idea, it was nice to read something different, especially with a strong female protagonist who doesn't waste her time brooding. Very enjoyable all around!"
4,Good summary,"In my first year of teaching and enrolled full time in college I have very little time to wrestle with textbooks! I found this book to be very detailed for the amount of material it covers. The worksheets aren't essential, but could be good for someone who is not in a classroom every day. Good coverage--addressing the eternal question of depth vs. breadth, and it does well enough at both!"
1,Why hide what's inside?,"Amazon has an easy way for publishers to share what is ""inside the textbook,"" but this publisher chooses not to use it. If the publisher is too ashamed of the book to let people browse it, why should anyone purchase the book?"
1,Poorly written and crammed with mostly useless information.,"I was very disappointed with this textbook. It seems that the authors have crammed the book full of as much information as possible whether it is useful or not. There are a few good parts in the book, but you have to wade through so much irrelevant, wordy garbage that it isn't worth it to find the few gems.It really isn't necessary to have 6 paragraphs on cell phones in schools. I didn't need a book to tell me that I shouldn't leave my valuables lying around the classroom. The book instructs teachers not to touch electrical cords with wet hands.If you can't figure this stuff out on your own, then you aren't fit to run a cash register, let alone a classroom."
2,Too thick for clip-in belt holster,"I bought this battery online because I couldn't find anything compatible ""on the street."" Sure enough, buying blind comes with a price (in addition to shipping).I have a Samsung E105 phone. Turns out this battery is thicker than the original. Sure it fits the phone, and I'm sure it works as a battery, but my phone no longer fits in the clip-in belt holster that I use 24/7. Great - now I have to find a new way to carry it, and I can't trust another blind purchase because there's no telling whether a different holster is going to fit.Hooray for crappy documentation."
2,Doesn't hold a charge,Purchased this as a replacement battery for the Samsung X427. This was the only place I could find it since the phone is older. The new battery did not hold a charge for any longer than the original one I had for two years. I returned it to Amazon and they sent another free of charge. The second one is really no better than the first and also does not hold a charge for very long (more than a day). I will keep it to use as a spare in case the original one dies.
5,Awesome battery,"I really needed an extra battery for my phone because of how much i use it, This battery fitted perfect and was a great deal in price. I recommended wireless technologies"
5,Couldn't have asked for more,"A Great addition to my Blu-ray collection. With Four-Discs consisting of : the DVD, Digital Copy, Blu-ray Movie and a bonus features disc. They didn't forget a thing. Thanks"
5,It all comes down to the story line,"Pixar has always held the belief that the story line is what counts the most. Yes, their computer rendering is spectacular; I felt that I could actually feel Sully's fur or feel the cold of the blizzard! Yes, their characters are fully developed. Yes, this movie contains all sight gags we have come to depend on from Pixar. But in the end, it's the story that counts and I (in my fifties) still get choked up at the ending.Even if you were to only watch the movie once, the additional short features, games, outtakes, and background features will keep you entertained for many, many hours. (Believe me, if you have young children or grandchildren, you'll see it many more times than once!"
4,Very good flick but not great,"Monsters Inc. is a very good movie, but I think the hype left me a bit dissapointed.The story of monsters behind our closet doors we all feared as children is outstanding. John Goodman and Billy Crystal are absolutely amazing as the voices behind the two main characters, and will be identified with these roles for years to come. However, I didn't find it as funny as many other reviewers. There were some jokes I chuckled at, but nothing I really laughed out loud about. The role of the child in the movie is a bit weak, I would have liked to have seen the animators make her a bit older and funnier. I did find the parallels between the real world and the world of the monsters funny at times.What I thought was the funniest part of the movie was actually the ""out takes"" at the end of the DVD. Those are the things I really laughed out loud at."
5,Cute Movie with Superb Video Content,"Okay, it is a Disney movie (or Pixar, same thing--more or less) so you aren't going to sit down with your college buddies to watch the movie. However, if you are looking for a quality DVD in regards to video quality and audio seperation, this DVD is a must have DVD.II found myself getting tricked by this video as sounds came very distinctly from the rear right and rear left channels on several occasions throught the presentation. The seperation is simply stunning.The video portion is also something to note with high regard. Each frame of the video is perfect with no lines of resolution visible even at close range."
5,A True Winner,"The writers of Monsters Inc. are to be commended for their insight into making a movie fit for adults and children. I took my five year old niece to see this movie and we came out raving about how wonderful it was. Now you have to understand that saw this movie when it first came out, but my niece and I have been waiting somewhat impatiently for the time when we would be able to enjoy this movie over and over. If you want a movie with laughs, excitement and even that moment when you brush away a few tears, this movie is surely to be you number one choice."
5,Fantastic Movie,"I love this move. I was so much looking forward to buy the DVD that I couldn't pass the offer. It is funny, and has a lot of unexpected scenes. Great for children of all ages, unlike Atlantis or maybe Lilo & Stich. Highly recommended."
5,HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! . . . YEAH--IT WAS THAT FUNNY!,"What a hilarious, goofy, warm-hearted film! It passed the JOY test--my two-year old kept asking to see it again (even when her favorite Caillou was on--sorry PBS). Commercialism, the energy crisis, jobs vs. ethics, employee incentive programs (yes this one even encouraged team work) that turn employees against each other--all the big adult issues are plowed through in a manner that tells us the kids are right--stop screaming--go out and play instead.Joy triumphs over fear in the end, and good characters win, bad characters lose, and cunning characters get their just rewards. Monsters Inc. is a joyful film that will leave thoughtful viewers contemplating the monsters in their own lives, and that perhaps we approach it all in a very backwards manner.The acting and animation were superb. This is great stuff! Buy it...rent it...enjoy it again and again!"
5,Great Price,"I order all my new releases on Amazon due to the fact that they are the cheapest out there! I love it! Great product, great price!"
4,Great movie!,"Pixar and Disney have done it again w/ Monsters, Inc. Storyline, voices, humor, and class make this computer animated film a winner. Kids will enjoy it for the cute characters and obvious humor, while adults will marvel at the subtle humor and inuendo. Be sure to buy the DVD for the outakes and bonus features."
5,pixar does it again,"Overall, great movie. Can't get bored with it!!! This one is touching and almost tops my favorite Wall-E."
4,"Delightful, original story - stunning digital animation","This DVD release is well worth the price - you get two discs,full of information, interviews and in depth studies of howthe film was designed, computer animated and finished. Althoughthe film is only 92 minutes, the material that accompanies it isfour and a half hours long.The film is a delight, very original in concept and beautifullydesigned. There is plenty of action and thrills without a greatdeal of evil, which is a relief. The colors are crisp and thelighting is luscious. The characterizations by John Goodman andBilly Crystal as the lead montsers are full of nuance, especiallyGoodman.The film earned a number of Oscar noms including Best AnimatedFeature and won the Oscar for Best Song - deservedly.A great addition to the family video library and great fun for the whole family.Highly recommended!"
4,Cool for all ages,"While I was skeptical of going to see another mediocre cartoon in theatres, I walked away from this flick really surprised. The animation in Monsters Inc. was great. John Goodman and Billy Crystal are a great on-screen vocal duo of the two main characters. I know my three year old niece loved this movie, and so did I. This movie translates well for DVD and the smaller screen with the sharp sound quality and out-there animation. I don't think this movie will leave you with any dissapointment. I give it a B+."
4,Funny movie! But this DVD is ONLY in English.,"This one is a gem, for sure. I don't really have much more to add to the other reviews, except for one thing. Just make sure you notice that there are NO other languages dubbed on this DVD. It is ONLY in English, which was disappointing for me, a French and Spanish teacher. Yes, you can buy the other versions -- separately. I was very disappointed about this when I purchased this DVD. (I did not purchase it through Amazon and it was not clear about this on the back of the DVD box when I picked it up in the store. Hard to believe they would make it only with an English track these days.)"
3,door room,they have to work hard rozz is always telling monsters he or she your paperwork is late boo gets scard when james p scared too much this is not a movie for 4 year olds
1,didn't recieve right item,"was very dissapointed when I recieved the movie that I have been searching for for a long time.It was the wrong region.I really wanted it to be replaced with the right ""region"" after I returned it,but alas I just got a credit.Was so dissapointed."
1,did not work,got the movie and put it in a dvd player and a computer and it would not work now i have to try and return it
1,Faulty DVD,"I received the DVD in time for Christmas, but when we put it in DVD player it did not work. I was frustrated because I looked everywhere for this movie--hate when this happens!!"
5,Disney's Best Transfer to Blu-ray!,"It was February first of two thousand ten when I recieved my copy of Disney/Pixar's MONSTERS, INC. and I--as I said in my Packaging Feedback--was very impressed. Disney's transfer of the film to Blu-ray was excelent: the picture was sharp, colorful, and clear. James Sullivan's fur was very realistic and the DTS-HD 5.1 surround sound was amazing. The film itself is one of my favorite Pixar films and in my opinion, MONSTERS, INC. is one of the films with the best ending. If you have a little one, or just liked to watch movies, I recommmend MONSTERS, INC. for your enjoyment and for its beautiful High Definition picture and sound. This film will leave you satisfied and happy."
3,Original,"This was definatly an original, funny, and touching movie. There should have been a sequal to this one."
4,Just wonderful,"I think I can finally get into computerized cartoons now hehe. Wasnt easy, Im from the old school....Dumbo, Walk Disney, etc but this movie really won me over. I wont spoil it for you but Ill say this....its absolutely wonderful. Great voices by John Goodman, James Coburn, Billy Crystal, Jennifer Tilly.Fun for the whole family and I mean the whole family.....from ages 8 to 80. Get it today!!!"
4,Great family movie,"This is, what, six years old? Still, for those of us who are kids at heart (and who grew up with monsters under the bed and in the closet), this is a very good rememberance of childhood, and a good tale for the kids of today that the ""bump in the night"" probably is a dream. I recommend it."
3,"Movie is great, packaging is fraudulent.","The movie is great, but the packaging outright lies when it states that it is closed captioned. Only the movie is captioned. This is normal when there is one DVD with a few extras on it, in which case I wouldn't complain (even though I'd be disappointed.)If two DVDs are included in a set, and only one is captioned, then the packaging and resellers should somehow communicate this to prospective buyers. I was really looking forward to the extras--but I can't watch them. I'd have liked to be pre-warned. I never would have bought the set if I had known."
4,Better than Shrek,"I know everyone loves Shrek, but I have to cheer for Monsters, Inc. Besides the great voices of John Goodman and Billy Crystal, I like the socially concerned plot line -- the environment. And, that little girl is just so perfect. Obviously the writers and artists know what four-year-old girls are like."
4,gave as gift,gave this as a gift. arrived just fine and timelyi do not have the time to give detailed reviews of every purchase.
5,We love Boo,"I never thought an animated character could be as absolutely adorable as Boo is...as an adult, I was hooked from the moment I saw Sully's animated fur blowing back and forth as he snored. As a parent, I just had to see Boo's eyes. My daughter is 3 1/2 and loves this movie. She gets a little scared at times, but the movie is done in a way that she realizes it is all in good fun."
5,Response to 'Meg',"If you look carefully at the particular dvd you bought, you will note that it says Region 2 on the cover. This means that this is a European dvd, so it wont work in an American player. (Try looking it up on wikipedia an1d you will see that I'm telling the truth). In fact the region 1 dvd is a good dvd. It is an easy mistake to make if you don't know about it. In future look and see if it has region 2,3,4,5 or 6 next to it,and if it does then don't buy it."
5,Great movie for all ages.,this movie with Billy Crystal and John Goodman is one of my favorite Pixar films. It's fun to watch with children or with adults. Highly recommend it!
4,Great movie! ^_^,"Finally badged my Husband into renting it, and he loved it as well. There is nothing so grand as a kids movie that's actually enjoyable for adults.The shorts included in the DVD are also hysterical, we must have seen the birds on a wire clip five or six times before we returned the movie.Great stuff! ^_^"
5,Adorable movie worth buying without seeing,"This is a wonderful movie about friendship and learning. I saw it and absolutely loved it! Even if you haven't seen the movie, it is worth buying and enjoying. I guarantee that even adults will love this movie!"
1,Buyer beware,"It does not work! Apparently, there are different regions in the world for DVD players. To the average person, like me, I did not know this! This DVD will only work in South America! But here is the funny thing, the company that sells it is here in the USA. Don't waste your money or time. They are allowing to return but I have to pay for the return shipping."
1,monsters ink,i did not get what i bought it said two disc i only got one an had no cover to it i only got one of the disc
2,"Monsters, Inc","I loved the movie, that is why I ordered it. Sadly when it arrived at my home it was for the wrong region or something and I had no way of watching it and had to send it back and therefore lost money on it. Wishing it had been the right DVD cause I do love this movie."
3,Disc Skips,The DVD skipped a lot. I know it's used but it's still disappointing to miss major parts of the movie.
4,Good movie,"This movie is pretty good. My 10 year old loved it. But my 3 year old (who usually enjoys children's movies) found it boring and refused to watch more than 2 minutes. Monsters Inc is also a good movie if grandparents are coming or if you have another family visit you. It is entertaining for most age groups. Everyone over the age of 5 in my family thinks it's great.If you are buying this for some one over the age of 5, I highly recommend this movie."
5,great family movie,"My son has wanted this movie for a long time. I finally was able to order it for him recently. He watched it many times during the first few weeks and it is still one of his favorites. This edition has 4 discs including a digital copy so I was able to put it on my Itouch so he could watch it on the go for those long trips to grandmas. The blue ray version, of course, was amazing! :)"
5,Another great movie by PIXAR,"Pixar does it again. The people responsible for Toy Story, Toy Story 2 & A Bug's Life. I've enjoyed all off them and Monsters Inc. is no exception. With Celebrity voices like Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Bushemi & Jennifer Tilly. Amazing animation that only Pixar can do. A great story and very funny. This is a must see fun movie for the whole family. This will be a must get on DVD when it comes out. If you like full length animation at all you owe it to yourself to see this movie."
5,Amazing animation,"When we saw this in the theater, I *knew* I needed to own the video... the details are just amazing (especially the movement of Sully's fur), and Billy Crystal and John Goodman do yet another fantastic voice-over job. This a movie adults won't mind watching more than once. However, small kids may have a little trouble near the end... my 3-year old did not like the scene where the little girl was kidnapped and threatened.The extras are pretty amazing, particularly the ""how-to"" stuff, which I love. The navigation through it is a little tricky though... especially trying to figure out exactly under which category subject can be found. Still, a must-have DVD."
5,100% Kid Friendly,"There aren't many movies that can be seen over and over and over again and still be enjoyed so much. My little sister is addicted to Monsters, Inc. Instead of having to look under the bed to make sure there are no monsters there, she wishes and hopes that when the closet door is opened, Scully will be in there waiting to ""scare"" her. She was Boo for Halloween last year and requested a Little Mikey stuffed animal for her birthday. Basically, she can not get enough of anything to do with Monsters, Inc.OK, I admit it. I'm hooked on Monsters, Inc. too. After seeing it thirty plus times with the little one, I still find myself actually watching it and laughing out loud. What a great movie with lovable characters.Monsters, Inc. is a 100% kid friendly movie that adults will enjoy as well."
5,Wow- This movie is fun!,"My wife and I went to see this movie and we loved it. I have always enjoyed the Toy Story movies, but this was a cut above the rest. Monsters, Inc. is funny and it is a blast to watch- We pre-ordered our copy in April and we cannot wait for it to come!"
5,HOMERUN.........AGAIN,"Leave it to Pixar to create, besides another blockbuster, a really touching story. In the grand tradition of Toy Story 2 and its predecessor and A Bug's Life, Pixar and Disney's fourth collaboration doesn't disappoint. Mike and Sulley are, what else? Monsters!! They work in a factory where each monster is assigned a door leading to a child's bedroom. Their job is to scare the child and collect the kids' screams. When one child, ""Boo"", crosses over to the monsters' side, Sulley befriends her and learns the importance of friendship, love, and hope. For you snifflers, bring extra tissues. Not only is the movie phenomenal, this DVD is packed full of goods. Looks like Pixar has delivered once again. I can't wait to see what Disney and Pixar cook up for their next meal."
5,Excellent Movie,"Great movie for two year old and up. My only issues are several times when one character hits or slaps another. Also several times one character will say ""Shut up"" to another. These are things that we never ever do in front of our children. Otherwise, it's a great movie."
4,I love that big furry fella,My 4 year old is obsessed with Monsters Inc. She tends to watch things over and over! I am not sick of this yet and that is saying something. Finding Nemo got old.... This is another fantastic pixar flick with very funny references adults will appreciate. Can't recommend enough.
5,Ever wondered why there were monsters under your bed?,"""Monsters Inc"" gives one explanation. You see, in a city called Monstropolous, their electrical power is generated by kid's screams. The monsters are actually more afraid of the children than the children are of the monsters.And that, folks, is the problem.As kids get more and more sophisticated, it's harder to scare them. Monsters are working hard to make sure they have the power to keep their city running. Sully (John Goodman) and his buddy Mike (Billy Crystal) are top-runners for the Scare Record, but they have stiff competition.Then, somehow, a kid gets loose in Monstropolous. Sully and Mike take charge of her, but can they get her back to her home without being found out---or having her harmed?""Monsters INc"" is a fun romp full of cute and engaging characters. Definitely a must for collections of kid films of all ages."
5,A Classic,"This is a classic kid movie. Besides being nominated for oscars, this movie also contains a lot of bonus features in two dvds. It contains games such as PEEK-A-Boo , deleted scenes, the making of the movie, the oscar winning short film For The Birds, a new short film about the characters from the movie called Mikes New Car, and much more. All dvds have the widescreen and fullscreen versions on them. It even comes with hilareous outakes. In other words these two disks are fun and full of things to do for hours. SO i highly recommend it especailly if you have kids."
5,Who knew that Monsters were so good?,I bought this on DVD and watched it with my four year old niece. She was mesmerized and we both laughed and worried about the characters together. The story is so well done and the animation is beautiful. It should have gotten best picture at the Oscars!It did not just deserve the animation Oscar.
4,"Monsters, Inc. review","Now their won't be anymore reasons to be afraid of monsters in the closet! This is a great movie for kids, my daughter loves it! Our heroine, Boo, shows that their may in fact BE a monster in your closet, but there is no reason to be afraid of it. I recommend this film to anyone with kids, and even those of us that are just young at heart! Pixar did an excellent job on this one,... but don't they always?!"
5,WONDERFUL,A great film and the DVD is loaded with extras. Suitable for ages two and up.This is a film most adults will also enjoy.
4,Monsters!? - Not!,"Great Movie! Only gave it 4 stars because I had to explain to my girls ages 4 & 3 a few times that there are no such things as monsters! They weren't scared of them, since the movie teaches them that the monsters are really cute, cuddly, funny, furry things!- but they wanted to know if we had some in our closets!It's a story about Monsters who come out of closets to get you to scream-because screams are what their world is powered by. The monsters think that KIDS are scarry! One kid gets into the monster side of the world and that's where this story takes off. They have to get her back to her world - but in the mean time they fall in love with this kid.Worth your time & money! Disney did it again!!1smileycat :-)"
5,Monster Inc.,"This was my second time ordering off amazon used DVD's. The service was fast, the product was in good condition, overall it was a pleasant experience. I would do it again"
5,love disney movies but why are people so freaked out over them??,i mean the themes???because when i was little NOBODY cared about violence.
3,Doesn't compare to Toy Story...,"Keep in mind that I'm 31 years old. I didn't enjoy this movie nearly as much as many other Disney classics-something was just missing. I didn't find any any of the main characters to be that funny or that charismatic, and the music wasn't even on the same level as Toy Story, although they tried very hard to duplicate the success of that movie and it's sequel.However, I have to say that my 11-year-old and 20-month old adore this movie, and will watch it over and over again if I let them!"
3,Great movie but....,You have to sit through 20 minutes of previews everytime you want to watch it. I'm wearing out the skip button because I apparently need to know whats comming in the fall of 2002. I'm guessing this is information I won't need to know in a month or so.... It's really annoying.
3,Boo is the cutest,"I was very excited to see this movie but disappointed when it didn't live up to how funny it looked in the previews. Though I'm sure children will adore this movie. The movie was worth seeing for one thing, Boo the little girl. Every moment she had in the movie was precious and she sounded so darling."
3,Could Have Been Better,"Monsters Inc. had much potential and could have been better in the hands of someone like Tim Burton, or even someone imitating his style. As it was this movie was merely ""all right"" and isn't one that will endear itself to too many people. Who knew, though, that all those closet monsters and below-bed beings worked for a good cause? And who says the movies have nothing to teach us?"
1,Did not work,Had to return the movie. It did not work. Tried it in three different players. Bought the movie for my grandson and will try buying it again.
5,Monsters Inc.,My 4 year old grandson thoroughly enjoys this movie and will watch it over and over again.
3,"Good animation, so-so story","Enjoyed it, Pixar is definitely up to snuff in the animation dept. Not nearly as witty as Toy Story or Toy Story 2. I thought Shrek was much better, and that says it all."
2,Ne pas se faire prendre!,"Malgrés le fait que nous avons fait très attention, nous avons été déu que ce dvd ne contient pas le film en tant que tel.Le dvd ne contient qu'une version imagée du film et est montrée comme si c'était un livre, en d'autres termes, ce ne sont que des images figées (screenshots) du film avec du texte affiché et lu par un narrateur.Nous somme donc déus que la description du DVD ne fasse pas clairement mention de ce détail que je juge très important. Le prix était trop beau pour tre vrai!"
2,Monster Inc,"Delighted to recieve it. Found it very entertaining and the my child loves it, never stops watching it, would recommened it to any one looking to buy a loved one a dvd for Xmas."
2,ok,This movie should have been good but it didn't appeal to me at all. It didn't even seem funny. I felt like I wasted money because I believed the hype.
2,beh,"Sure, monsters inc is very well done animation wise. The first few minutes I was just amazed by the way sully's hair moved, but after that I noticed that the story was boring. Alot of the jokes we've seen 80 times before and I never really cared that much in the first place. I laughed maybe 3 times through the entire two hours, and for me that wasnt enough when this was supposed to be so good, I'm just glad I saw harry potter in the theater instead of this tripe."
1,Monsters Inc,"I was excited to finally find this movie and at a reasonable price. I did not see the ""Region 2"" type until after I had made purchase. Obviously, it does not work in my DVD player. It comes up ""wrong region"". I undertand Amazon is a global company, but who would sell/send a region 2 video to someone in the UNITED STATES!! There should be some kind of stipulation in their system that keeps people from making such mistakes. Now, I'm out my $20+ bucks.Not happy!"
5,Must-Watch,"I think this is a great movie. It's about the monster world and how monsters have to scare kids by sneaking through their closets, to get power for their city. The main characters, I think, are Mike-who's a round green guy with one eye-and Sulley-who's a big furry purple-and-green guy who is also a top scarer. One day, when a lizardlike monster named Randall tries to cheat at something, a little girl enters into the place! Sulley and Mike find her, trying to put her back through her door, while Sulley and the girl he soon starts to call ""Boo"" become good friends. I really like this movie. A must-watch!"
4,Perfect for children and grown ups,"As I have no children of my own, I must admit I love kids movies. I buy them all the time, possibly I'm trying to recapture my childhood. Well this movie certainly accomplished that. It was cute, funny, delightful etc. With a nice smattering of ""grown-up"" humor, so parents won't lose their minds after little Billy asks to watch it for the 100th time. Being a Pixar film the animation was top notch, spectacular really. Very life like while still maintaining that charm animated films have. The voice acting was perfect, and very suited to the characters, and by using recognizable voices, it succeeded in humanizing the monsters further.The story, while predictable was well written. The script flawless. The bad guys were very bad, but at the same time like any good villian you can sympathize with them. This is a great movie for children and grown up children like myself. Buy it. Rent it. Just see it."
5,Another Disney Legend,"In the style of ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bugs Life"", this is Disney's fourth fully computer generated film...and it's incredible.The story is extremely creative. The world of Monsters runs on a special fuel, the screams of children (this might sound sick and scary, but it's really quite cute), but, the children aren't getting as scared as they used to, and the Monster City is having blackouts. Thus, we find ourselves at the scream factory. When one of the little kids gets into the Monster world, then pandemonium ensues.A very nice film that shows the extreme creativity within the Disney studios, this will soon be a family favorite. I highly reccomend this movie!"
4,Funny.......................,"Mike and Sulley are a team of scarers who work for Monster,Incorperated,an agency that powers all of the land the live in with the srceams harvested by the monsters.It goes like this:a machine drops a door inthe proper place with a srceam meter attatched,Monster walks through closet door,makes chlid scream,walks out,and the srceam is used to power the city of Monsteropolis...But what happens when a CHILD gets through the door?Sheer panic thats what!You see,Monsters think human chlidren are toxic,You touch one and You die...Well when the little girl-named Boo-Follows Sulley everywhere both are,well,upset!They decide to try and take Boo home,but is it possable??????????????????????I thought this was a wonderfull movie,another Disney Classic...i reccomend this movie to anyone,its not just a kids movie!"
4,not for small kids,"I thought the movie was pretty good; however, I would not recomend it for young children. There are a few parts that would scare a child.After watching the movie, one of my friends children would not want to sleep alone at night.The movie is cute and I like it, but I do not recomend small children to watch it."
5,cool flim,this is the best movie in the world the story line is great it is a movie that the whole famliy will want to wacth again and again
5,Shrek Who?,"Disney/Pixar has made another classic. They are an unstoppable force of brilliant movies. They've done the impossible and topped ""Toy Story 2"" with this one. This was the best movie of last year. I can't wait to own the DVD."
5,Funny movie!,"I love this movie! For once, I don't have to worry wasting my time watching another sequel of some other Disney movie.This movie captures the kid in you and you can view what it's like in a kids perspective of being scared of monsters.The plot is excellent! They learned a lesson from one kid.The way that they show how monsters supposedly live is amazing. Who would ever think that it was a job and how they made a living? I never thought that they'd have competition in how many scares they make. And who knew that they were scared of touching humans?!In this movie, the monsters have a change in heart. They finally understand that they don't have to scare to get their job done. They can keep kids happy with humor. And they are no longer scared of being close to humans.This movie has crazy antics along the way, adventure and will keep you laughing. It's a wonderful movie for all ages and a great family movie. No disappointment here!"
2,...................,"what is this movie, i don't understand this at all.are the people who made this movie trying to scare kids to believe that this monsters are real...now that is just wrong..."
1,IT'S NOT IN SPANISH,"DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU THINK THAT IS IN SPANISH, THE BOX IS COMPLETELY IN SPANISH BUT THE DVD IS TOTALLY IN ENGLISH AND NO OPTIONS FOR CAPTIONS, NOTHING."
2,Something was missing.,"This movie had a few exciting parts, but it really wasn't all that great in the theater. Perhaps viewing it on DVD would have been a better choice. I wouldn't feel as if I wasted money..."
1,Very Disappointed,When i tried to play this DVD I came to find out that the disc was formatted for a different region of the country and can not be played in any DVD players in the US. I'm very disappointed!
1,am I the ONLY one ... ?,"Am I the only one who thought this stunningly visual film was completely ruined by going W A Y overboard on the cutesy cutesy baby girl aspect? Don't get me wrong : I realize that family fare such as this is aimed at ""little ones"" and those who love them (as I do) but C'MON! This is one of the rare computer-animated releases that will NEVER darken my shelf and certainly never clog my DVD player. Enjoy, all ye sappy-syrupy cravers !"
2,Low rating for digital copy portion only,"Digital copy is a joke. I spent extra money for it and then my computer crashed. When we bought a new one with the exact same apple account, we could not transfer the movie to the new computer. Sine 90% of the viewing of this was on my phone for my son, we got very little value out of this purchase."
4,so adorable,This is a very cute movie for kids and adults the kids love it because of the amazing and cute characters in the movie and adults love it because of the humor
5,Monsters inc,"I bought this movie on VHS for my kids. I have, and still do buy from Amazon, so imagine my surprise when I realized that this was sold to me by a third company. The VHS arrived at my house BLANK. I sent several emails to this company and never received a reply. Sent emails to Amazon and didnt receive a reply either. Sent the VHS back for exchange or refund and didnt get either. I had already paid my credit card so I could not contest the charge. Most unpleasant transaction. I give the moviw 5 stars because it is EXCELLENT, just DON'T BUY it here!!"
5,Blu-ray Well Worth It,"This is quite a value, especially if you don't already own the DVD. This is one of Pixar's best and the extra content and extra sharp blu-ray images are worth the investment."
5,Touching,"I enjoyed this DVD VERY VERY much. Monster Inc. is much mroe than just a cartoon, it is a cartoon with a soul. A soul that convey a message of forbearance, openness, and friendship (the last few seconds of the film is classic cinema). Unlike many corny animated films, this one strikes a chord for both kids and adults alike. When I think of Toy Story and I see Monsters Inc., I cannot believe how far animators have come in both storylines and visuals. Not being much of a fan of kid flicks, I nonetheless gave this movie a try because of all the positive vibes surrounding it - and I am glad I did."
5,Monsters Inc,"Great service, arrived in 3-4 days. I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone who wants to buy great quality dvd's for a cheaper price."
5,I just loved Boo,I have to say that I am usually not a big fan of animated films. Sure they are great for kids but....Well this one hooked me. I love the relationship that Sulley and Boo form. Boo is definately a character of unconditional love. She is fascinated with Sullivan even though he is terrified of her. This movie really makes me laugh and I want to buy it for my 3 yr old niece.
5,Wish there were a sequel!,"It was that good! Unfortunately they didn't leave a door open for a sequel. Great story about the Monsters all little kids fear in their bed at night, and their interaction with those kids. It gives you the persepective from the other side of your closet door where the Monsters live. The characters are very lovable. Great, great comedy sequences, you will be laughing out loud! Unique story line. ""Loving"" out-come. Enjoy!"
5,Another Great Movie,"Monster's Inc. Is a fun movie for the entire family. If you liked Toy Story & Finding Nemo, then you will without a doubt want this movie for your collection."
5,MONSTER HIT,"I was unsure when purchasing this as to whether it was going to be too childish, but I can't seem to stop watching it. I love the characters, the story line, but most of all the attention to detail in animation. This is an instant classic. But I'm sure you already know that !"
1,not so happy,"The image quality is ok, but the sound quality was pretty bad. The volume is coming in and out, can't really hear the dialogue. :-("
1,"Australian dvd product, sucks","I wanted to see in LARGE PRINT that is came from Australia and will not not work in a US DVD player, total waste of $$$. So looking and found another source for electronics, games, movies. Bad form guys!! lynn Bordelon"
1,Monsters Inc. Region 2,I do not know what Region 2 means and that should have been explained in the discription. This DVD does not work and ANY of my DVD or BlueRay players.Very disappointed!! Would NOT recommend this seller.
2,Monsters in your room!,"Monsters inc is the monster world's scream factory. Screaming kids is their best way of making energy for the monster world.Top scarer Sulley is the best at this job with the help of his assistant, Mike. Randall, 2nd place scarer, is determend to beatSulley to the top. A kid gets invited in their world when Sulleyfinds a left over door! How will Sulley & Mike get the kid backbefore Randall takes the number 1 place?"
2,So tired...,"Am I the only one that's sick of the same damn characters in every Pixar film? How many times do we have to be subjected to the Mike Wazowski character? Come on! Plucky, wise-cracking, comedy-relief of a side-kick. As for the rest? Be sure to expect a round of cliches bottled off with some contrived ""twists"", and a really moronic plot (Kid's screams? How long did it take to think THAT wild idea up? Morons). There's no wit, little is funny, characters are not even close to being engaging or interesting... Pixar used up all their steam with their other 3 classics (Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life)... it's no wonder this mess is void of any intelligence.Finding Nemo looks equally bad."
1,It didn't work,I bought this movie for a friend and it wouldn't play! I need a refund! What a waste of money!
2,boooooooooooooooooooo,"this movie involves monsters in the closet,something have been trying to rid our kids minds of for years.thats just stupid.thanks guys for carrying this sick tradition on!the story is about a whole other world filled with monsters.instead of electricity,theier world runs on screams collected from children at night.are you sure this is disney?it sounds more like stephen king.the top scream getter,a huge blue with purple polka dots guy accidentaly pulls a little girl back into monster world with him.well in monster world,she is considered toxic.sickisnt it?so all the government and people are on a manhunt for this helpless three year old girl.so he and his partner decide to save her.that fat guy from the tv show roseanne.they must have payed him good to put up with her all that time.shes one of the top 5 worst people on a tv show ever.i dont think its for kids myself.its not really all that good.theres a cool chamielion whos the bad guy.this movie sucks!thats the truth."
3,Adult viewers opinion,Pretty nice story that kept me interested throughout the entire 93minutes. Don't have kids but enjoy the Disney approach to morals and life and diversity. Neat computer grafics and different technique from Toy Story [the makers are the same - hence the two are often compared].Nevertheless to give it more than 3 stars would mean it needed a little more pep to it to keep me entertained. Amazing is the 2nd DVD - 207min of add-on material. One can certainly get lost in all the material hidden behind any of the doors. I wished they had showm more about the actual sound making and speech overlay. Especially of that of the little girl - Boo. My favorite character. So adorable. Overall comment - worth watching when in the mood for some harmless uplifting storyline.
1,BAD,"It does not even play, its all scratched to crap and the second disc has a crack in it. I already gave a review on it and that was never replied back to."
4,Not a combo pack,I ordered this specific movie because it said it was a blu ray/dvd combo pack and when I received it in the mail it was only the blu ray. So I was disappointed but not enough to send it back.
4,very creative,"Monsters Inc. was definitely a one of a kind movie. The plot was very good and very unique, while the animation was the tried and true Pixar style. It was pretty funny, although not as funny as I hoped, yeah, and it had some morals built into it, the subtle type. I do think that any audience would like it, although the younger group would probably love it. It was good with no obvious faults, and maybe the reason it was not as funny as I hoped was its deep set storyline. But, altogether a good movie."
5,"A sweet, funny, touching movie","Here is a film for the kid in all of us, adults and children alike. This movie creates a fantasy world full of childlike wonder and humor - the characters really come to life thanks to brilliant computer animation and some inspired performances by the likes of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and the late James Coburn.I watched the film without knowing much about the actual plot beforehand (an approach I would recommend to new viewers). However, I enjoyed it as much the second time around. Not only is there humor, but there are some sweet and touching moments that are handled perfectly and never stray into the realm of sugary sentimentality.The attention to visual detail is amazing and will reward repeated viewings. This is perfect for families to watch together without anyone being bored: a delicate feat that the filmmakers carry off admirably.In short, this is a movie that makes you feel good. Simple as that. What more can you ask for during these trying times?"
4,A fun movie - even for adults!,"I highly recommend this movie for adults and children! If you liked Shrek, you will also like this movie!"
3,BOO SAVES THE DAY,"Pretty darned good movie overall,but if it wasn't for 'BOO'the movie would have been a waste of time. Only in a Disney flik could one little kid cause so much trouble and be so cute doing it."
4,Something for everyone,"There's a little something for everyone in this movie. It's kind of cartoonish for the little kids (might be just a little scary for some of them), lots of not really violent action, a plot that while silly (monsters scaring kids to capture their screams for use as an energy source) is pretty well done, good characterizations (especially John Goodman as Sulley and Billy Crystal as Mike Wasowski)and some really interesting computer animation.These things alone would make it interesting to watch but if I buy it it'll be for the extras."
5,I have seen this movie at least 100 times...,"... because I have a toddler who *loves* Pixar movies. Before this one, it was Toy Story I and II. They still get plenty of watching, but Monsters, Inc. has taken center stage for the moment. The best thing I can say about this movie, besides echoing the positive reviews of other posters, is that I haven't gotten sick of it even through all the watchings. Every time, I notice something new and subtle, and always funny."
3,A little let-down,"When I was young, I remember this being my favorite show, even a little more than Sesame Street. But now as I watch it again for the first time since the 70's, I'm not sure why. I think maybe these aren't really ""The Best of the Best."" The last episode was definitely more the way I remembered them all. (Of course, it could be that I'm just not a child anymore!) Anyway, as an adult I think Sesame Street has alot more to offer. But it was fun to see the few skits I did remember!"
2,ho hum,Perhaps this is a little too old for me. It has nothing that I remember about The Electric Company from my childhood. It is also a bit much for my 3 year old. I will keep it and try it again later but first viewing was not exciting at all.
2,A bit of a let down compared to my memory,"It is the Electric Company, alright-- and your favorites are here, ""Easy Reader"", ""I'm the plumber, I've come to fix the sink"", the silhouettes that sound out word pairs (like ggggg- oat, gggg- reat, ggggg- one) etc...It is all kinds of supa fly and SOOOOO 70s. But, as an adult I notice the ""economical"" sets and low-tech special effects more than the groovy retro vibe. I think there are more effective videos to teach reading out there, and the Muppet shows and School House Rock stand the test of time better for entertainment value.The most interesting aspect of the show that I certainly never grasped as a little kid: the cheesy innuendos. It made the first watch thru moderately funny, but not enough so for me to watch it again.I will be most likely to play this on a TV with no sound during a party."
1,BAD DESCRIPTION,"Product was delivered quickly.Product arrived in good shape.Be careful, It does not say it inthe description but there is anOld style case and a New style case.we were told that the fact the descriptionindicates that this bucket is also for the 305is the indication that this is thenew style bucket.Although it does not say this inthe description.If you have the old style 304motor, the clips will not clampdown on the new style bucket."

3,"Good, but poor proofreading","it states that pH>7 is acidic and pH<7 is basic in chapter two. This is obviously wrong and was missed in the editing. There are also small errors throughout the book but as whole it delivers the information in a concise form. This is more of a review book though, so a textbook on biochemistry will be needed to fully understand what is going on. The most impressive parts of this book have to be little pieces of information that helps to understand ""why"", which are usually not directly addressed in biochem text books. The example that comes to mind is the solvent levelling effect. I have only seen it glanced over in biochemistry textbooks, but it is important and helps reinforce acid/base concepts."
5,A Biochem must.,"This is a well written, well illustrated book. I found it very helpful and highly recommend it."
1,Doesn't work,I tried this on two different pressure washers. It does not work. I took it apart an could not see anything broken. I wasted too much time trying to make it work. It makes an interesting paper weight.
2,Not what I expected...,"The bag is poorly padded, and the backpack straps are flimsy, will be returning it. This bag is similar to the freebie you get when you buy a guitar."
2,NOT AS AVERTISED,"THIS PRODUCT WAS RETURNED BY ME UPON RECIEVING IT. IT IS ADVERTISED AS PADDED, BUT THE PADDING IS EXTREMELY MINIMAL. THE PRODUCT WOULD NOT PROTECT THE GUITAR PROPERLY."
5,Delightful!,"me and my girlfriends so enjoy listening to the let me take you back collection of kerri's. we gather for weekly coffee ""breaks"" at each others houses, and kerri's music is always playing in the background. it provides a fun and light atmosphere and brings back such wonderful memories! the piano versions of the songs are flawless, and it's a worthy investment.=)MG"
1,How Original!,If you're tired of hearing classics turned into elevator music then don't buy this CD. Kerri's music is the pits and enough to put you into a comatose state for years. I've heard better music played on a washboard!
4,"A-side good, but one B-Side is classic","Very big fan of JS. Joining the 60's go-go bandwagon that seems to be infusing the musical airwaves these days, Jimmy has produced a fun and very racy single here. Not many songs about this topic. Can't wait to see if the notorious British censors will let this one slide. Of course we don't have to worry about that in the U.S. because Jimmy never gets any airplay anyway. But the real gem on this CD is the extra song ""I Believe"". It is impossible not to move to this one. Third song is a little dull, but is short and has a sexy sound. Haven't heard the album yet, but if I Believe is on it, I'd pass on this single and just get the album. If not, it's worth $13 bucks just for I Believe."
2,"Good concept, poor design","We bought this to help our kids get in and out of the tub w/out getting hurt. The concept is great, but the design is horrid. You have to line the cups up and hold your tongue just right to even get them to stick for more than a minute in the first place. The suction cups just aren't strong enough, my 25 lb 2 yr old could torque it enough to break the suction and he liked to play w/the tabs and pop them lose while he was in the tub."
2,Safety Rail COULD work,"This seems like a good thing but as it states it is not intended for full body weight. I think if your bathtub does not have the indentation on the outside, making a ""rim"" then this may work great. Unfortunately for us, it doesn't work at all with our bathtub. This is why I had to give it a lower rating. I was also hoping it would double as a security bar for my dad who need some extra support getting in and out of the tub, as well as my toddler. But it definitely wasn't made for that.I think if you have the right bathtub and you want to use it just for kids, it could work well but it didn't for us."
1,Good Idea- Wish it worked,"The product is a great idea. It went back the day after I received it though. No matter what I tried, the Kidco Bath Safety Rail would NOT securely attach to the side of the tub. The suction would not stick and it was very wobbly. Again, it's a great idea, but I think if it were made a little less cheaply it would work fine."
4,A Sevillan Tablao,"My only insight to this CD is from the sample tracks. Although the quality of the recording is lacking, it is the true flamenco you'd hear at a tablao, including the hand clapper and the harsh, vibrating voice of the singer -- a very typical flamenco sound. You can picture the proud bailaora in her traditional polka-dot dress. It transported me back to Sevilla, Spain."
3,Shop Vac Pre-Fliter,Description was not clear. I expected a slip on filter and what was received is a sheet that is taped on. It was bought to go on a craftsman shop vac and it does not cover the entire filter. Probably my fault for not paying more attention to the description.
1,needs help,"I opened up the vac to dump it and the pre filter was laying in the bottom! Seems the adhesive is not strong enough to hold it in place. Now what to do, I am thinking maybe rubber bands. Poor quality."
4,fits old shop-vac,Fits our old shop vac wet & dry vacuum cleaner. This item works well as pre-filter. Nothing more need be said.
5,The BEST!!!,"I LOVE this DVD!! I got it for my birthday and since then I have watched it at least 15 times all the way through- not to mention the times when I just watched individual songs. . . I basically have it memorized =) These guys are incredibly talented singers and dancers (not to mention HOT), and it definately shows in their concert!! A must have for any NSYNC fan!!! Do I sound obsessed at all? Probably true. . ."
5,TUNE IN OR MISS OUT...,"I'm an 'N Sync fan from Day 1 and everytime they seem to top the effort made before... No kiddin', this Live Concert HAS IT ALL... I live in the Netherlands, Europe and I had to send for this video but is was well worth it. Excellence spats off the screen from the first second till the last breath.... The energy is absolutely consuming and you won't be able to take your eyes off the set. Now I knew Justin was talented but what this guy does with the beatboxing caper is 'OUT OF THIS WORLD'. Also the close harmonies are dead on ! Now for all of you non- believers out there..... IT'S TIME TO START BELIEVING in 'N SYNC. They are THE REAL THING and if you don't tune in now you'll miss out ! Get the video or DVD...."
5,Nsync - Totally awesome!,"A must for every Nsync fan. I was so impressed that I had to see them perform in person. Can't wait to see them again. If you can't get to see them live in concert, this video is the next best thing to being there. The No Strings Attached tour that is performed live is almost exactly what you will see on this video. This video is so good that you will watch it over and over again. I wore out the 1st copy that I had which is why I had to buy another one."
5,*N SYNC totally rocks,"Okay folks. GET THIS VIDEO! N sync may be a ""boy band"", but they have a style all their own. these guys actually have talent, both singing and dancing, and this video shows everything they can do. i saw it on HBO and loved it. now that i can own it, i'll probably wear it out. they're even better in person. these guys have a gift, and this video showcases it wonderfully."
5,The best concert ever!,"This DVD is a must own, especially for those who don't have cable and didn't get to see the HBO special. I saw the concert in Los Angeles, but was very far away and this awesome DVD gave me the chance to see it up close and personal! This is a must have for any *NSYNC fan, whether or not you got to go to the concert!"
4,Different M.O.D. still sounds killer,"M.O.D. polished up their sound after 'USA for MOD'. They were less punky (musically and lyrically) and more full-on mid-paced thrash with some hardcore tendencies. They still put together another thrash gem. All of the songs have hooks, thrash hard, and have attitude. Those things are easier said than done, because Milano wasn't able to capture this on any of MOD's subsequent releases. I don't still own any M.O.D. releases after this one (got rid of the ones I bought and then finally stopped buying them!)If you liked 'USA for MOD' and you are a fan of SOD, definitely check this one out."
1,half of this never worked,"I decided to risk the purchase based on previous reviews. I got it and it seemed like it would be fine. The VCR portion worked beautifully, audio and video. The DVD portion's audio was fine, but the video never worked - all I saw was jagged lines across the screen. Would not recommend this product."
2,"Cheap quality, Bad Remote","I purchased this vcr/dvd based on the fact that it wasn't the most expensive one and it wasn't the cheapest either. As soon as I took it out of the box I was unhappy. It is a featherweight. It does not play any of my VHS tapes that I had previously taped on my old VCR. The tracking is off and you can't fix it manually. I dislike the remote - the control buttons for which unit you are controlling are hard to find - buried in the middle of the all the buttons. There is no volume control or easily identifiable tracking buttons on the remote. The stop button is also the rewind button, and it kept doing the opposite of what I was trying to make it do. The channel changing number buttons are small and not easy to use because of their low position on the remote. Overall I was quite unhappy with my purchase and am taking it back to the store."
3,Does what you would expect for $80.,"We shouldn't complain...VCRs are getting harder to find, especially one that actually works.I installed this on an older analog TV, and the picture quality with a coax cable is quite good for both DVD and VCR. However, two different S-Video cables did NOT work with this unit, so I went back to a coax. I suppose my mom wont complain.Setup is a little convoluted, you may have to refer to the manual to get this unit working, but at least the manual appears to be fairly coherent and the instructions are clear. The remote is somewhat confusing with too many buttons and not enough features, but again for the money this is not a bad choice, especially for a secondary TV. One flimsy composite cable is included and batteries for the remote."
2,"Great price, bad sound","While the price is great, the sound for the vcr playback is awful. There is a nice high pitch whirl when the vcr is playing (not in the unit-throught the speakers). I did find that DVD's had a good quality sound, but unfortunatly the purpose of buying a combo was to use both..."
1,Ghost in the machine,"This unit is horrible. It has a mind of it's own. It never would tape a show. (Yes, I had everything set up correctly). It won't play a DVD unless there's also a tape in the machine. When you try to play a VHS tape, it will only play for 15 seconds and then the machine turns itself off. The entire unit just shuts off! Save your money and get something else!!"
4,Something new for us...,"We are a low tech family, but I managed to figure out how to use this, and it played both tapes and dvd's well. The wire that came with it was flimsy and broke, but the company sent me a new one right away which I'll handle with more care. So far, so good."
4,No Problem - Works Great,I purchased this item to use for my Video Editing needs. I ended up using in on my 65' HDTV because my VCR/DVD Recorder started to act like a cheap garage sale VCR/DVD player. I have not experienced any problems with this Philips device as far as playing VCRs or DVD. It was simple to hook up.
5,Gets the job done,"This machine is perfect for the second TV in the bedroom. Yes, the remote could have been laid out better, but once you're familiar with it it's fine."
5,Prophecies Made Into Songs for Worship,"This was my very first MP3 download.It went smoothly and excellent.Even though this was made in 1983,It's still timely for today.I consider this one of Chuck Girards best works.The song Name Above All Names is an awesome song.Soldiers Of the Lion paints a very clear picture of Christian warfare.the song Kingdom Come is what we should all be doing.JESUS IS LORD & JESUS LOVE RULES !!!!"
4,Good book,"I, on the other hand, thought that this was a good book. It was NOT too wordy or predictable, either. The begining was not neccessarily slow, but just not as interesting as the last half of the book, but once I got to last half, I couldn't put it down. It was just like listening to an old myth. I would recomend this book to anybody who is a fan of story telling and the powers behind it."
2,New Age Rehash,"I don't know why I didn't like this book. It was too wordy, too perdictable, too much something. Why is it that white's are always being protrayed as saving the Native American. I've read many novels about Native Americans and this one reminds me of some new age person who has the facts and language down, but it's really boring and drons on and on. The characters are cardboard cutouts and easly fit in a 1950's western movie. I only wish I could return the book. If you want a good read try Scarlet Plume, Hanta Yo, or any book by a true Native American like Sherman Alixe."
3,Great sandblaster but watch out!,"Sandblaster is well built and works great, but the filler gasket is very expensive. Mine blew out after 3 years, maybe 5 uses.Just a soft red rubber 3"" ring, how could it be $40.?"
4,Great,This book was in fabulous condition. It was great considering it was used. My niece was thrilled to get the cookbook and didn't mind the minor notations next to some of the recipes. She thought it interesting to see what someone else had tried already. A great book for beginning cooks or college bound students with little time.
3,Seasense canvas fastener kit,"I have yet to use this particular product, but by just knowing what was needed and looking at the product. I'm sure that it will provide what is needed to fix my canvas boat top."
5,Great Product for the price,"Received my violin today. It is very beautiful and sounds great. It's perfect for the beginning to intermediate violinist. My son, whose been playing violin for over 12 years now, says it is really good for the price. He wanted to snag the pitchpipe that came with it, so I told him I would share it. I didn't have any problems with the bridge or the strings. If you know the proper way to tune a violin that has very slack strings for shipping purposes you'll do fine. If this is your first violin, take it to a violin music store and they will set the bridge and tune it for you (usually for free). Being new strings, they are still stretching and I found myself tuning them after every couple of songs... but that is to be expected. The pegs do tend to creak and slip when tuning, but that is normal with new violins. I recommend purchasingThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsleyto solve the problem."
1,Cecilio CVN 300 Ebony Fitted Full sixe 4/4,I just received this violin. I too had the same problem the string broke when I was going to tighted and the bridge does not have and notches. I want to return this item to it seller but I am finding it difficult to contact seller to send back and get my money back.
3,Additional Fees for Processing,"I received this item, and discovered that the kit does not include the cost of processing the test. I believe it is inappropriate for this information not to be disclosed in the advertisement."
1,Wrong Movie,This is not the movie Rosie the Riveter that is so moving about the 4 women who worked in Richmond. It is a dud narrated by a man with some footage from WWII. Don't buy it. Amazon: be more careful in future about explaining what this is to make sure customers (like me) are buying the Rosie the Riveter movie that is better.
2,Disappointing DVD,"This dvd features 3 episodes of the documentary series America At War:The Home Front that aired on PBS pesumably in the '90s as Eric Sevareid, the narrator, passed away in 1992. Only the first episode, ""A String of Pearls"", is about the ""Rosie the Riveter"" phenomenon of women taking over men's jobs while the men were at war. The other 2 episodes cover other aspects of the war & its effects on the warfront and have nothing to do with ""Rosie"". If you want a more comprehensive look at ""Rosie"", keep looking."
2,Bad design,"My wife loved this when she first got it. The head is the right material. Bad design though. The rollers only go down a little bit and so don't wring out the head. You still have to squeeze it with your hand. Also, after a little more than a week the head is starting to pull free from the metal strip. I expect it will have to replaced soon.Anyone know where I can find an old fashioned O-Cedar cellulose squeeze mop?"
5,Best mop ever!,"I've had this mop for more than 10 years and have only gone thru 1 refill. It holds 10x its weight in water, leaves the floor practically dry, and the mop head never smells or gets mildewy. People need to remember to let the dry mop head soak in a pail until it is soft and pliable before mopping. If you try and squeeze water from it while the core is still hard, it will cause undue stress on the squeezing mechanism. My squeezing mechanism just snapped today, but after a dozen years, that's OK. I'm ordering another one. I've tried the Libman - fail. I tried the Mr. Clean mop with the scrubby on the end - a total failure. Neither of them pick up the water they dump on your floor. Another bonus is that this mop leaves your floor totally streak free. As I have cork floors, I have to be sure that water is not left laying on the wood, and this is the best mop I've ever found for them. Buy a refill when you buy the mop to save a buck or two - you won't find these refills in the store!"
4,great mop,"I love this mop, the sponge is great, the floors are dry within minutes of mopping. I have gone through so many mops trying to find a good one, they always come with useless sponges that just spread the water around and leave water marks. They're on every mop on the market. Finally Rubbermaid has a great sponge on it's mop! It's easy to use, wrings out great. The one and only thing I don't like about this mop is the adjustable handle, I cannot stand that type of handle and I don't know why anyone makes them. They never stay where you adjusted them, they always collapse on the ""push"" motion and you almost fall on your face. Other than that, I have had no other problems. It's worth paying more for this mop after using cheaper mops with really bad sponges that just spread the water around and are not absorbant."
2,Great..when its not collapsing,"I love the PVA Roller head, it works fantastic and has held up to daily abuse for several months now. The handle is another story, it collapses constantly and I am constantly tightening it up only to have it collapse a few minutes later. I wish the shaft had true locking mechanism instead of the twist and tighten mechanism that it currently has that does not work. If this mop had a better handle it would be a 5 star mop but it is so frustrating in its current state I couldn't give it more than 2."
4,Super absorbent,"I own one of these and am toying with the idea of getting a second. It's not that I love mopping floors, but once this is pre-softened, there is nothing can compare with its ability to pick up spills and water seepage, then deliver its load neatly to a bucket. You do want an extra-wide, rectangular bucket to go with it so you don't have to hold it at a funny angle to operate the wringer."
3,Rubbermaid roller mop,"The mop arrived quickly, that was nice. The mop head was encased in plastic and I had to remove the mophead to get all the plastic off, not any easy task to remove the mophead. The screws holding the mophead are already rusty on the tips so I wonder how long they will last. The mop has a telescoping handle, and it collapsed 4 times in a 30 minute period of use. The mophead cleans very well, and without a lot of water so that the floor dried quickly. The mophead allowed me to scrub hard, and I liked that but I did not like the collapsing handle."
5,Best mop I've ever owned.,"I bought a similar mop through TV-sell. While I paid far too much for it there, it was the best mop I ever owned. It leaves the floor fresh, dust-and pet-hair free and almost dry. And best of all, the mop keeps smelling fresh, as it is somehow rot-and bacteria resistant.Most practical and efficient mop I own. Only drawback: you can't scrub the floor with it, just mop it. But brushes are good for stains.This brand, Rubbermaid, is even better quality then the TV-Sell one, and that one lasted me five years in perfect working order."
4,I am so grateful they make refills for this mop!,"I have had this mop and the original mop head for over 2 years. Keep in mind that it is used in a house that is approx. 800 sf of moppable flooring, but still, that is a very long time in the mop world.Today, it went. The mop head strip that holds it to the handle had rusted. When I was unable to find a replacement head at the store I broke down and purchased a Clorox Roller Mop.That mop ejects it's mop head into the bucket when you wring it out, unless you wring it by hand first. What a fun way to wash a floor!I'm placing my order to a replacement for old reliable."
4,Good...But Let It Get Fully Soaked,"This is the best mop I've ever used. It soaks up a ton of liquid and it is pretty easy to wring out. The bad side- the mop head will pop out if you don't let the mop get completely wet before trying to mop. It takes about 60 seconds for it to go from hard to soft and moist. If you try to mop the floor while it is still hard, it will pop out."
5,EXCELLENT mop and good price for the quality,"Mopping is one of the worst chores, just under laundry. But, if you have to do it, this is the mop to get. Mostly made of painted metal (the handle and mechanical parts) and a few key heavy plastic parts. This mop should last you for years. Best of all the mopping head is made of quality, highly absorbent material. I have never owned a good mop. The ones sold in most stores are junk and the mop heads are make of crappy material that doesn't soak up liquid and wear out quickly.Thumbs up on this one. It really works great."
1,"Good, then very Bad..","This mop worked great three times. Left little water on the floor, all the good stuff that other reviewers have mentioned. I didn't like the inability to scrub the floor with this product. But what really generates this review is the fourth time that I went to use this product. My floors are tile, reasonably smooth, and I am a big guy, 6'4"". Filled up my dual bucket, let the mop soak in the water portion, squeezed it out, put it in the detergent portion of the bucket, and started to mop. POP! out comes the sponge out of its holder! Drat!! Double Drat!! I unscrewed the holder, and forced the sponge back into its holder, reassembled everything, and went back to mopping. Pop!! Triple Drat!!! Out it comes again. Had to go back to my ""Quickie Sponge/Scrubber"" mop, which actually did a better job. Don't buy this product. I can't recommend it."
4,Rubbermaid G780-04 PVA Roller Mop Review,"I love the sponge but the handle doesn't stay in place and I keep having to tighten it.Floor dry's very fast and cleans very well, just the handle which is important to fix."
1,Very inferior product,"One of the worst products I have ever purchased. The telescoping handle collapsed every time I applied any pressure. It would not stay in position.Then, on only the second time of use, the mop head came away from the serrated jaws that were meant to hold it in place. There was no way to replace it. At the same time, the handle fell apart. I have never seen such a poorly designed item. You would think manufacturing a mop that did not disintegrate on day two would not be that difficult."
2,Mop from Hell,"I must say, I'm completely befuddled by the rave reviews. The mop performed reasonably well on my tile floor, but when I tried it on my laminate floor, it morphed into The Mop From Hell. The PVC rubber created such a friction with the laminate, it literally forced all my stomach muscles to clench just trying to get it to budge an inch! And once I got enough momentum to grind it against the surface, after a couple strokes, the head dried up and I had to start the torturous ordeal anew. Additionally, the lever to wring the mop head - while it is effective - is situated really low down to the floor. So either you have to mop with a strange neanderthal crouch, or you have to constantly joist the mop up to reach the wringer. And lastly, the scrub-ability ain't that great either. Works fine on regular blotches, but the rubber is so dense, any force you use just gets absorbed instead of directed at the stain. Yup - the immense physical strain certainly warrants it being the mop from hell..."
1,does not work,THE FIRST TIME i USED IT THE MOP HARDLY SOAKED UP ALOT OF WATER AND IT POPPED OUT OF THE HOLDER. FRUSTRATING!
4,Americana: 1950,"This is an amazing piece of 1950 Americana with a nice father, nice mother, nice son, nice people who believe in God and care about having decent morals - a far cry from films in the past 40 years.The story, acting and photography is okay but nothing exceptional. Today, it would bore 95 percent of the viewing audience. The main appeal is simply its homage to an innocent age (if there ever was one!).It was interesting see Nancy Davis, who became Nancy Reagan.At first, she appeared pretty plain bit the more I view this movie, the prettier she gets...especially her eyes. The story, without spoiling it, is simply about people who hear God talking through the radio to them, trying to get them to think about things.Theology-wise, the movie is pretty vague and general, not wanting to offend anyone but it still had a good message. Overall, I guess you could label this film ""a curiosity piece"" and certainly a slice of Americana."
4,Can You Do.....,the Milano Mosh? This is classic thrash with in your face lyrics and pounding drums courtesy of the phenomenal Charlie Benante. Mention S.O.D and almost any thirty-something will get a smile on their face. It was almost like a rite of passage. Buy it for a slice of history.
3,Memories from High School,"I remember when this record came out when I was in High school, around 1986. I loved this record, but unfortunately, S.O.D. never toured until just recently. I would have loved to have seen these guys! Listening to this ""Special"" edition, which includes a live concert, brought back fond memories of when I could care less about society and its ""rules"". A good investment."
5,Metal at its funniest!,"This is the most hilarious album I have ever heard!!! All the songs are awesome, even the ones under ten seconds. My favorites are definitely Sargent ""D"" of the S.O.D., Freddy Kreuger, Anti-Procrastination Song, and The Ballad of Jimi Hendrix.This is a must buy for people who love metal and making fun of other people."
5,"If you like this album, you might also like...","If you like this album, especially its political message, you might also like Skrewdriver. Although you won't be able to get Skrewdriver on Amazon.com or at Wal-Mart, you can easily get it from independent sites on line. They were the band that literally started the right wing skinhead genre in the 1980s. If you like the lyrics on Speak English or Die, try Skrewdriver's Hail the New Dawn, Blood or Honour, or The Strong Survive. In fact, any of the 20 plus albums from Skrewdriver or any of their side projects are excellent. For far right 80s and early 90s music, besides SOD and MOD, try Skrewdriver!"
2,not the real thing,cos the real thing in this crossover/hardcore category is surely D.R.I. they got the tunes whilst SOD only got noise. compare those two and you'll know what i mean
1,Don't make me laugh! Speed?Brutal? Hah!,"If you have the urge to bring out that White trash spirit lurking in you, if you want to kick back and close your eyes and SMELL the trailerpark, the pork rinds, and the Captain Crunch, this is the album for you. It's slow mediocre metal geared towards insulting women, gays, immigrants, and much much more! If Hitler floats your boat, this is the WhiteTrash Epiphany Album of the Millenium! Ignorance is Bliss! Listen to this while you graze in your pasture."
5,Loud and right in your face!,Not the kind of cd you want to have playing when Grandma comes over.Definately the best of S.O.D.
4,HOLY ...!!!,Man...This album is CLASSIC. A must have for all true mofo's. And trust me when I say that this ain't no poser rock ( e.g. DISTURBED)or anything of that ... genre...wait a minute...how can I EVEN compare S.O.D to such ...!!!
5,Great cd,"Fun cd to listen to with friends, old school metal, reminds me of the days of partying and having fun"
2,Keep it in the boardrooms,"I was interested in what this book had to say up until reading of the examples which pertain very little to me or my work. Our company started the implementation process (yes, you can buy workbooks!) and I was startled by the lack of accountability this book encourages. The process of responsibility only goes up in this book, and the examples it provides deal primarily with management. The principles of feedback and coaching are important, but I can't see myself, a wage slave, being any more accountable than I already am. So if you're thinking of buying this book, buy it for yourself and don't foist it upon your company like my bosses did."
4,Very Good,These rotors perform great on my 2005 Avalache. They would be a 5 star but the black coating that you pay extra for was not applied fully and evenly on my rotors. Does not affect the performance but it will rust in the areas not protected.
5,This book is a terrific time-sink!,"Because I'm a working historian with a strong interest in material culture and artifacts, combined with a tourist's interest in Civil War battlefields, I've long been a fan of Troiani's amazingly detailed, extremely accurate, almost photographic art. This gorgeous volume combines large-scale reproductions of 130 of his paintings with some 250 color photos of surviving uniforms and equipment from museums and collections around the country (including Troiani's own). After a couple hours of page-turning, I went back and spent much more time studying the depictions of units of special interest to me, such as the Washington Artillery of New Orleans and Terry's Texas Rangers. The variety in uniforms and insignia is staggering, especially compared to the ""uniformity"" of modern military uniforms. As usual, he includes extensive technical notes and specs, as well as an annotated guide to artifact collections. It's not a cheap book, but it's worth every penny."
4,Very Good--But Could Have Been Better,"Troiani's work is always top-notch. I would have given this book a 5-star rating, except that several units are covered more than once, which means other interesting uniforms were not included at all. I realize that with the sheer volume of his work it becomes a matter of picking and choosing, but I still would have appreciated wider coverage."
3,Keeps the bugs away,Coils do a great job keeping the bugs away. Terracotta dish arrived busted due to poor packaging.
1,Shattered,There are two pieces of poorly baked terracotta squeezed in a box with one layer of cling film in between. What were they thinking?Read all the arrived-broken reviews. Don't bother.
1,All 4 Clay Pots Arrived Broken,"Should have listened to the other reviews. Ordered 4, hoping that 3 would make it safely. Amazon packed it fine, but within the box, there is no protection. Returning it at Amazon's cost. This item should be pulled as substandard."
3,wanted to try one of these but not particularly this brand.,filament didn't stay lit and sometimes it fell off the little pin. Found I liked the yankee candle product type more to do the same thing.
4,Great product. Discontinued. Missing parts.,Great quality and value for the price. Performs well and doesn't show much oxidization even with a rather heavy use. The only problem I've encountered was a missing pan lid #26 which apparently had been discontinued and hence not replaceable. Kudos to the retailer though - they did their best to obtain the part on my behalf and did refund it's market price back to me. I didn't return the set since I was able to locate a substitute but keep in mind that it may not be an isolated incident (since exchange / replacement was never an option).
4,The Rods actually here,"This Lp was sort of like a side project by the Rods. I have never really known why it was released the way it was, titled that way. I have all of the Rods releases, so this was just a natural projection to pick this one up as well. It is not a departure by any means of there hard driving rock & roll sound."
1,Buyer Beware,"This software will send usage information about your child to the parent corporation for marketing. [...]This is hidden in the ""User Agreement""."
2,"I really didn't like this, and I'm sending it back...","Recently I've been moving around a lot, so I decided it would be much easier to have one all-in-one screwdriver, instead of a bunch of screwdrivers I have to keep track of. This is the second of three different types of all-in-ones that I tried.The handle is very unergonomic, and the screwdriver weighs a lot. Worse the weight is distributed poorly.The bits in the handle seem like a good idea, theoretically, but one bit I pulled out (instead of sliding it out) kept falling out until I bent the holder back into shape. And, no the instructions don't tell you to slide them, nor is it obvious. Plus metal shavings came off of the one bit I used!Perhaps some people will benefit from the 4:1 speed mode, but I didn't. If you really need this I think you'll be much happier with an electric screwdriver.I just bought this today at Target:STANLEY 9 in 1 Screwdriver Set Model 62-511So far I am so much happier with it.I'm going to return the SmartPro to Amazon."
5,I Had That Hair!,Love Coverdale. Love the CDs - ALL the CDs. I love the fact the he will re-record a song a couple times because it goes through a Genesis of sorts and you get to hear what it sounded like back then and it shows up a few years later sounding even better. Good stuff.
4,Good coverage but......,"I've bought bra's for just about every vehicle I've ever owned to safeguard from love bugs here in Florida. I bought one for a 2002 Saturn. Looks good on the car, the attachments for the fenders were different as the saturn has push pins so no clips, luckily has stayed in place, though I was doubtful. Only gripe I have is that one side doesn't line up, no matter what you do, how many times you take it off etc, so left side lines up with the hood, right side is up about an inch (and no you can't bring it down)."
2,Really not worth it.,"I really don't feel it was worth it to buy it. It's tiny, looks of poor quality and has turned a portion of my finger black. Hence which makes me doubt its worth."
1,A Weak Book,"Ed Bulkley takes the anti-psychology argument to such extreme it becomes a sort of spiritual McCarthyism, actually limiting God. No true believer would deny the power and authority of God's Word, but that doesn't mean you throw out all other valid forms of knowledge including the study of God's magnificent creation--the human mind.If you had a loved one with deep mental problems, where would you rather seek help? Would it be one of Ed Bulkley's novice biblical counselors who don't know a neuron from a kneecap, or a professional Christian psychologist, who combines his knowledge of the inner workings of the mind with biblical truth to produce the best of all counseling results?This book goes beyond why Christians can't ""trust"" psychology to a legalistic ranting of why Christians can't use the science of psychology in any way, shape, or form. A weak book from a non-scholarly, pharisaic author."
1,Sad attempt at defrocking psychology...,"I have read this book three different times in the hope of finding ANY positive thing in it. (Whatsoever things a beautiful....) I cannot. This is a book filled with resentment, bitterness and half-truths. I suggest readers of this text read; The Psychologies in Religion by Dowd and Nielsen. Reading my mentioned text immediately following Why Christians Can't Trust..., will be a TRULY eye-opening and BALANCING experience!I can only hope that the authors of Why Christians Can't Trust (this would actually be a more accurate title!)will enter therapy SOON to deal with their existential angst issues!"
5,Almost cooks too fast.,"I'm used to cooking slowly, and waiting forever to get my food... Now I don't know what to do with all the extra time! I am going to buy another one so that I can cook a side dish quickly as well."
1,Not acceptable.,"Aluminum not the best material for cooking for health reasons. Stainless steel is preferred.Aluminum containers for cooking high acid sauce foods, like tomatoe, is dangerous.mmmBob R, home owner."
1,"failed seal, bad service","the seal failed after 2 month use. and manufacturer refuse to replace it. they claim 12 year limited warranty. It's a joke when the product and service is not good. We get a mirro one, much better"
5,4Quart pressure cooker,Pressure cookers are simple and this one simply worked as it was designed to do: Plop the food and water into the unit. Close the lid. Make sure the weight is on the steam spout. Put the unit onto the heat source. When the weight starts to wiggle set a timer and reduce the heat. When the timer goes off turn the heat off and your food is ready. What could be simpler?
1,dangarous,"This product is a safety hazard. I bought this on January 2011, and now, after working with it for a year, the black round thing on the lid poped out, the steam burned my left hand so bad, and so wast! if I was close enough, the damage would have been worst!....... I am so so upset.... I even took a picture to show... but can't figure out how to post the image."
1,Presto pressure cooker,"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker, purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap, it not only does not do the job, the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker, that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk."
1,Cheap and That's What it's Worth,"There is little good about this Presto 4qt Aluminum pressure cooker. It...Cannot keep the handle tight, I have to tighten it down about every other use.Cannot form a steam tight seal, steam leaks out around the handles, making them hot to touch, and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off...it doesn't.Cannot keep the broth (fluid) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level.Has no opposing handle; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down.In a word, we got what we paid for...the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market."
4,Good features,Cooker is worth its value..cooks well in time and has good safety features..size is perfect for a family of 3-4..
3,presto 4 qt pressure cooker/////,"It is a pressure cooker, and does its job....but, I'd rather have my old presto back, it is smaller, and I loved it....handle brokje off after 50 odd years!"
5,Perfect One,"I had a 6-quart Pressure Cooker earlier, but that one was a little too big. This 4-quart is the perfect size for daily use. Easy to handle and clean. It does the job."
4,Pressure Cooker,"Presto 01241 4-Quart Aluminum Pressure CookerGreat for standard pressure cooker needs, not larger enough for those really big jobs.Only issue I have is that the finish dulled completely when put in dishwasher"
1,Do not buy!,"After 2 months of use, the screw that holds the bottom handle became loose, so much water and steam was spraying out that I just had to trash it!Even 1 star is too many!"
4,Replaced a 43yr old Presto,"I bought this pressure cooker to replace one that we got as a wedding gift, 43 years ago. I would not buy anythingbut Presto when it comes to Pressure cookers. I do have to say it is smaller than my old 4qt one. This oneactually fit inside the old one. I only used it once so far. You have to turn it down pretty low or the liquidcooks away. I have to get used to this new one, it is not exactly the same as my old one. I just wish I had knownit was smaller than the old 4qt. model. Amazon was terrific in delivery. It came way before I expected."
1,shipped to wrong address.,"oN THE NORTHERN TOOL SORRY FOR THE POST WRONG ITEM, THEM ITEM IS FOR THE PRESSURE COOKER.was returned by the p.o.and credit given."
1,This cooker is dangerous,Had worst possible experience with this one. It gave all kind of troubles and a mini accident happened once. Returned it after 2 days. Not recommended for Indian users.
2,disappointed,I've been using presto 6 qt pressure cooker for the past 5 years and decided to get the 4 qt for my needs. Ah! It worked great for a month and then the steam leaked allover and finally the safty plug blew off ( really scary !@##) looks like there is a problem with the pressure regulator.. this happened to my older cooker after 5 years but this one so soon ??!.... sent it back for a refund..
2,Just ok.,"The only thing I did not like about the product is that it does not give whistle properly. It keeps on hissing continuously and you have to think on time...ok the food should be cooked now. If you are thinking that its going to give proper whistle and counting that your rice/dal is cooked, then I would suggest not to go for it. For example if you want to cook rice..let it keep hissing for 10-15 minutes and your rice/dal will be cooked. Good luck."
4,Cooks great. . . as long as you read the instructions!,"As some others aparently couldn't figure out, this pressure cooker has a cleverly designed safty interlock in the cover that will prevent you from opening it if there's still pressure in the pot. This is so that you won't burn all the skin off your face with high pressure steam. If you want to open it right after cooking, you have to run cold water over it to cool it, which reduces the pressure.As for it's cooking ability, it's amazingly fast. Things that normally take several hours to cook (e.g. dry beans) take only 1/4 the usual time, or less. My only complaint is that it's not big enough for large meals -- you can't fill it more than 2/3 full."
4,Great product for the price,"This isn't the best pressure cooker in the world (plastic handles you have to install), but it's great for a 1-3 person household."
2,Stainless but CHEAP!,I would have to rate this pressure cooker as on of the more disappointing purchases through Amazon. The price is cheap for what turned out to be a cheaply made cooker. I would rather pay much more for a cooker with a thicker layer of stainless and more secure handles. The lower handle design depends on one screw - it doesn't work. I am finding that it loosens too easily. I don't want to continually tighten screws on my cookware.
2,Lasted about one + year,"After about one year pressure started to leak from around the rim due to some design flaw. As other reviewers pointed out, the bottom handle tends to get loose and it makes it impossible to hold the steam.Admittedly, I paid only $25 for this and used it maybe 3 times a week, so I wouldn't start to scream foul play or anything, but obviously the design flaw could easily be fixed, so I can still say there is definitely muchroom for improvement for this product."
1,"Sorry, but it's not all good","The idea of putting a picture of an item together with its mark is admirable, and the book is useful in this regard. It is not a complete guide, but then again, no book of marks is.However, the date information given for some pieces (for example, Syracuse China) is very inaccurate, and there are misidentifications that should not have happened in a book of this type. I would not rely on the dates shown in any way whatsoever.The unfortunate part is that there are sources that could have been consulted to obtain the correct information (including titles from the same publisher)."
2,Not impressed.,"It's true, there are numerous marks, but I was truly disappointed that they were pictures taken on the object and the problem is they are not readable. The reason for having reference is to help identify a mark and year and I would have preferred an actually factory mark so it was legible and then how it might appear on product. Not all that helpful."
2,Good news and bad,"The good news: this book has thousands of photos of ceramic items with their backstamps. The bad news: there are many inaccuracies of company names, typographical errors, errors of dating, and other errors. Given the over 7000 photographs in the book, perhaps it is to be expected that there was insufficient proofreading or fact checking before the book was published. The book is interesting to browse, but it has not been a reliable reference book. However, it is useful as a jumping off point, when used in conjunction with other reference materials."
1,Hugely Disappointing,"Several glaring omissions (Meissen, Delft, Moustiers, Deruta, to name only a few), Oriental pottery practically inexistent, no keys or tips on individual manufacturers, no mention whatsoever of rarity or value, altogether a useless photographic array of (mostly) self-evident porcelain marks."
1,Anazon robbed me,"I have bought this book from Amazon.com and never received it. I wanted to contact Amazon but the book does not exist in my account, so I cannot solve this problem. It was the last time I have bought something in amazon.com! I am very upseted with this.!"
5,Wow!,"I have found some of these things on my stuff at home. Very informative. Love,, love it. I want more."
