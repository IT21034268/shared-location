5,Well organized interesting book,"Each chapter is all about a specific month - explains the best flowers that bloom each month - takes care to be universal most of the time, rather than regional"
4,Thick and sturdy mat,"When you're in the store, you can easily tell the difference b/w quality and cheap -- the downside of buying online. I am pleased with this mat's sturdy construction and thick, tough rubber. Better than I expected at a great price."
4,Black rubber car mat,"Got this mat to protect the rug in my truck from the winter elements.Am happy with it, looks good and does the job, also the price was right.On a bad note and by my own fault,took only one out right away and put in my truck.A day later I went to get the other one found the box and mat had been taken awayand disposed of as garbage. Do like the mat enough that I will order anothermatching one."
1,Smells-Not the quality they used to be,"I've used this floor mat design for over 15 years and it has been one of my favorites. Unfortunately the material they are made from has been changed to some kind of cheap rubber compound that is stiffer and has a strong ""burnt rubber"" smell that I associate with poorly made chinese products. The mats have been in my car for 3 weeks and the smell has not gotten any better. Enough, they are in the trash and I'm airing out my car."
5,A Great Classic,This is a great classic cartoon collection! They don't make them like this anymore! A great dvd for those of us who were born in the 60's or early 70's!!
1,Terribly disappointed!,"Upon installing this software, my computer slowed down to ""snail speed"" on startup. It took at least four times longer to boot up than without it. I uninstalled in within a half hour after installing. It is even difficut to uninstall . . . I had to go to ""msconfig"" and uncheck it prior to uninstall, because it wouldn't uninstall otherwise. I have a great system, Pentium D 940, 3.2 Ghz,4 Gb RAM, so even though that I knew the software was a ""memory hog"" I expected it would work okay, but I'm going to stick with Norton Antivirus, Spy Sweeper and Spyware Doctor to protect my PC."
4,Zone Alarm Pro,Takes a little effort to get all the permissions set up but it has definitely stopped several excursions by unwanted others into my laptop. Does a good job as a Cookie Killer too
5,Outstanding Firewall Software,"I really enjoy using this software firewall. Once you set it up, it is very easy to use, and very effective, too. I highly recommend using this product, especially if you use DSL like I do. Don't go on the internet without using this product, and with the privacy filter, you are protected."
2,This game needs alot of work!!!!!!,"First let me start by saying I love Rob Zombie and what could be better than listening to Rob Zombie and slaughtering monsters, well guess what the only Rob Zombie music in the game is in cut sceens which really... .Don't get me wrong its got a great story and plot but it is very boring and very hard!!!! All you do is go from stage to stage killing monsters hasent that been done enough? One thing i really like was when a monster gets low on power you will see ""Fatality"" flash in the corner and if you push two buttons at the same time he will cut there head off and smash them with his hatchet which was cool the first 5 times after that it gets really old. the graphic need so much work they look terrible! I recomend you rent this game before you buy it."
3,This game could've used some work,"The first thing to irritate me about this game is the false advertising. The packaging displays the VGA symbol when in fact, it is NOT VGA compatible. A Konami rep apologized for the misprint. The second irritation was the constant problems with the game locking up on me. This really drove me nuts. The only other bad thing about this game is the pathetic ending. It's as if they cut the game off half way through leaving you to wonder what just happened. There are some good points however. The game is about 1/2 the length of a Tomb Raider game, so you really get your money's worth there. Rob Zombie's music was a real nice touch as well. And I had a great time hacking through hundreds of creepies. Some people label this as repetitive, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,Grief upon the Dreamcast,This game is poorly done and very shoddy. There are too many bugs that annoy and fraustrate players. It's very gothic though and sometimes has the effect of drawing the player into its dark world...
4,Lego action never disapoints,"My eight year old had this put together in no time at all. Lots of creative play. This toy has already been reinvented using other lego parts into several new lego guys, cars, monsters etc."
3,Coolest Feature can be a Pain,"This Exo-Force set comes with a really cool laser spray paint blaster (that's what I call it). The blaster is easy to attach, but then it falls off if you move it too fast. Everything else is pretty sturdy. It's a good toy with lots of pieces. I just wish the blaster would stay on better because I play with my Legos and don't just build them. -from a 7-year-old Brickmaster"
4,'American Splendor' prequel,"Pekar tells of his turbulent, frustrating youth in 1950s Cleveland in this first graphic novel of a five book series from Vertigo/DC Comics. Dean Haspiel and Lee Loughridge's greytone artwork is outstanding. Definitely recommended for fans of the American Splendor series and movie."
4,Pekar's Quitter,"As a long time Pekar fan, along with comic book collector and Jazz enthusiest, I was anticipating exactly what came out in the book, the Quitter. I liked it but there was nothing new about Harvey or his ways revealed. But that is one of the things I like about his writting, it is kind of like a walk thru the park, pretty reliable. The illistrator who did the drawing was pretty good, although no where near a Robert Crumb. He didn't do anything that hasn't been done before.The Story was pure harvey. I recommend the book but wouldnt sepen my last dollar on it, maybe wait for paperback version."
3,Insightful Look at Early Years,"Harvey Pekar's works are never flattering to himself, and this one is no exception. He writes about his youth in Ohio, struggling with his self-esteem and identity, and forging a name for himself as a street fighter. It's painful to see the unflinching honesty of a ""quitter"" on these pages, to see him want things not-quite-enough to get them. This part of the book is beautiful and the art by Dean Haspiel is bold and well-drawn.I didn't like the ending of the book that deteriorates into Mr. Pekar stroking his own ego and trying to puff himself up with his later accomplishments and photos of his youthful self. He doesn't need to do that and it diminishes himself and the book, in my opinion. Maybe he had a problem with endings because I have noticed this kind of thing in his other graphic novels, also.I still think this book is worth reading despite its flaws and I do recommend it."
5,Very good tool,The product arrived at the time I expected. The quality is amazing and I also bought another 3 sizes and soon I will order other tools from Park Tool. Thanks a lot Park Tool.
4,Mighty Joe Young,this was the first to come out and when the 2nd came out i had to have the first one for collection.
3,Mighty Joe Young DVD,Great old standby movie. I needed trivia info from it. It was shipped and delivered promptly and arrived in great shape.
2,"Not in Color, Movie in Black & White not listed as such /","I received the movie Mighty Joe Young and it was in Black & White. I was shocked, because I thought it was the latest one and in color. Not very satisfied with product. Advertised not as Black & White. Very dissapointed with product. It was for my Grandson and he was very dissapointed with the Black & White movie."
4,"""King Kong Lite""","From the people who brought you the original ""King Kong"" comes this lighthearted 1949 variation - featuring an agreeable cast and Oscar-winning special effects by Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen (who delivers an excellent commentary track). ""Mighty Joe Young"" may lack the stature of the ""Eighth Wonder of the World,"" but it's an impossible film to dislike. Executive producer John Ford later said he had nothing to do with the picture, even though a few Fordian touches remain."
1,Blinding Beacon - Sheds Little Light,"Given you need sunshades to look directly at this lantern, you'd expect that it would light up a room or campsite - but instead it just sits there, blindingly bright, attracting ever insect within a quarter mile, dispersing little to no surrounding light whatsoever.So it's back to the old reliable coleman lanterns for me :)"
5,Lives Up To Promise,I'm very happy with this produce. My 11 year old dog is more energetic and her gums have greatly improved.
5,Sherwood RVD6095 Surround Receiver Tremendous Value,"This surround receiver is a tremendous value for what you receive - both Dolby Digital and DTS decoders built-in, numerous functionality available only on more expensive receivers, etc. Its lower power (60 watts per channel) makes it most suited to smaller home theater speaker systems (I have the Cambridge Soundworks Ensemble IV). The receiver also does not offer S-video out. The RVD6095R is a great receiver value and has all of the features of its highly rated sibling, the RVD6090R. I highly recommend it for those wanting a highly versatile home theater receiver but who don't want to spend a lot or those who have smaller speakers to be driven by it."
4,A solid value receiver,"This is actually the third Sherwood receiver that we have bought. We bought an entry level Dolby Pro-logic home theater package, with the 4050r receiver. This receiver is definitely a cut above the older one. This one has much better push through the high and low ranges than our old one. Even without a digital source, the clarity from the receiver is excellent. For an entry-level digital receiver for someone on a budget, I believe this receiver would be an excellent choice."
2,Bastante flojo,"Primer LP de Evelyn. Grabado en SIGMA SOUND STUDIOS en 1977 SIN la intervencion de la familia "" Philly "". Tan solo Dexter Wansell escribe el tema "" Show Is Over "" que junto con el archifamoso tema "" Shame "" son los unicos que se salvan.Como curiosidad Teddy Pendergrass escribe el tema "" Dancin',Dancin',Dancin'"""
3,SHERWOOD RVD-8090R,"Warning this is a high end unit 105 watts per channel, 6.1 channel but does not have speaker switching.A/B I have an extra pair of speakers in my patio and this unit has only has 1 main front speaker unit hook. Now I have to figure out how I can use my outdoor speakers!Also, no phono hook up.Ralph DeVito"
5,blue's cluesMy,"My 3 yr. old grandson was so excited to get this backpack, he wore it everywhere for days! It's hard to find Blues Clues items anywhere now they aren't making the anymore....a bummer!! Thanks to Amazon for having it in stock and shipping it right away! A happy 3 yr. old once again."
2,disappointing,"Very cheaply made and tacky. I purchased it as a gift, but when it arrived, I had to run out and find something else. It would have been embarrassing to put my name on."
4,A classic mouse trap that does the job.,"In a world of new gadgets, some things are best done the old fashion way. With all kinds of new devices for trapping, killing and warding off mice, a bunch of these traps is still the most cost effective, safe way to rid your house of mice. These traps have been around for decades and they work with the right bait. Buy this classic trap with the metal food petal rather than the newer Victor trap with the yellow plastic pedal. These latter traps are often more expensive and erratic in setting up. Victor recommends peanut butter as a bait. I found that mixing in some Italian bread crumbs with the peanut butter can be more attractive to mice."
5,Big Box of Death,"Man, these are hair trigger. But so nice to have a big supply of clean traps to catch the field mice that come into our old farmhouse."
5,Why try and build a better mousetrap?,"We live in the country and every year when the cold comes so do the mice. We've tried every possible way of trapping mice except poison (sorry but I draw the line at catching-and-releasing mice, particularly when the hantavirus is so prevalent in our area).Anyhow, we use the trap only once, whether it is triggered or not, so it can get expensive if you have to pay for 2-packs from the hardware store. This 72 pack was cheap (.50 cents apiece), arrived fast and they are simple to set. The version the company makes with the plastic cheese-looking device didn't seem to work for us. We put a dab of peanut butter on the trap and that works well. If you have to deal with mice, this is the device to use."
4,Benificial for all Christians,"I wouldn't call it complete; I have come up empty on many words; more could be added. Nonetheless, this is an excellent easy to use reference guide in dictionary form; from Abba to Zodiac. Rhodes covers more than 1000 topics with more than 8000 references.If you question, or that red flag comes up, you can quickly look up the word that comes out in conversation and easily reference it to the bible. Each word references to numerous old and new testament verses. Bring scripture into your daily vocabulary. Understand the positives and negatives of every day life.Ron Rhodes is president of Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries. He has written numerous books; all highly recommended.Wish you wellScott"
2,find it fast in the Bible,"I found this publication to be very limited in what it offer to ""find fast"". not A good buy for me, shop around and get the most from your Bible and money. Especially if your needing to help someone."
1,"Tacky, not cute","There's a fine line between tacky and hip, and these slippers are not it. These slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person. Also, the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber-y fabric. They're not made for warmth. All around disappointing."
2,boring! boring! boring!,"This is not a good exercise video. The alleged 1 hr. ""workout"" only has about 10-15 minutes of cardio with the rest being devoted to stretching exercises. There is nothing erotic about the exercises other than a small strip-tease style floor move at the very beginning. The video ends with you putting on 4"" stiletto heels and exercising in them. Unless you are a very beginner who has never done a workout video before, this is not for you."
1,Defected Video,"I loved this workout, it got your heart pumping and made you feel super sexy! But, there was something wrong with the video itself, it would freeze up on so many spots and in the same spots everytime. I called the support team and they acted like it would be fixed but I don't think it ever was, very disappointing."
3,Not easy to understand,"This is hard to follow, I read about half way through and had to put it aside. This might be well suited for a pastor or Biblical scholar. The interpretation is very difficult to follow and I found that the sermons that Spurgeon preached on this book are much easier to understand. The First Epistle of John is a delight to read, this author confuses rather than edifies"
2,Like The Movie This Cd Is mediocre!,"This cd is missing something, it just dosen't seem to flow together.It seems like when they make a movie soundtrack nowadays,they like throw together all the happining names they can find and not concentrate on making good music.The songs like most movie soundtracks don't go with the movie and don't mess together at all.Perhaps they should go back to letting one or two artist do a WHOLE SOUNDTRACK!"
3,heart broken,"i was really looking for the one song on the movie I Do by Mark Middleton. I special ordered this cd and it broke my heart that out of all songs, that one was missing. Now the only way to mend it is to go out and dig deep to find this song. Wish me luck."
5,Review of The Brothers soundtrack,The CD is wonderful and my mother listens to it everyday. She had been looking for it for years so i was so glad that i could find it online for her. The quality is great and the CD never skips.
3,"Where is ""I Do?""","I am in search of the song that was played during the parent's wedding. It is called ""I Do"" and sung by Mark Middleton. If anyone has the song please e-mail me at dezwaters@yahoo.com or techols@uga.edu"
4,Nice...Very NICE!!,"This cd has been burning my player for well over 3 weeks now!! Hot tracks from Eric Benet, RL, the family Levert connection...Really liked Jahiem's cut ""Let it Go""...could have been longer...smooth nonetheless...""party tonight"" from Sumthin 4 The People was booty shakin'...Overall, a good cd that backed up a good movie!!"
2,No Thanks...,I heard this soundtrack a while ago. It is not very good. I had no urge to purchase it.
4,CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME FIND MY SONG OF LONG!!!,"I totally agree with Shannon from Atlanta, Georgia. While watching the movie, ""The Brothers"", several times, I fell in love with the song ""I Do"" by Mark Middleton. I thought that maybe it would have been listed on the soundtrack, but when I found out that it wasn't, I was devistated. I want to purchase the song for future reference, so if anyone knows how I can get a hold of this love song, please help. I have searched and searched for this song on the internet and still haven't accomplished anything. Please somebody help me find this song of love."
4,Just as good as the movie.,"A must have for anyone who loves all the artists featured on this soundtrack. The Dave Hollister's song ""Forever"" is the perfect wedding song, not to mention that Eddie and Gerald Levert team up once again for an outstanding track ""Two of a Kind"". If you are looking for some Hip Hop and great slow jams all in one you've got it all right here. And see the movie too!"
4,Important information for anyone wanting to get his/her point across,"The authors of MADE TO STICK have written an interesting book about how to make ideas stick. Some of the information is well known in communication and writing circles, yet this book puts the information together in a compact package providing a handy blueprint for anyone who wants to get across an important idea.By referring to the book's recommendations, anyone can create or discover material to make an idea stick. And if everyone would follow the advice of these two authors, the rest of us would not have to sit through so many boring and rambling speeches/lectures/presentations that fail to connect with audiences.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"
4,Putting theory to practice,"Whether you are a CEO seeking to make your company stand out among your competition, a sales executive aiming to meet your numbers, a business owner striving to sell your services, or a job hunter wanting to convince a potential employer that you are the candidate for the job, this book is for all of us. It provides a straightforward, step-by-step approach to creating ""stickiness"" in your ideas. I learn best through examples that accompany theory, and the Heath brothers satisfied this learning style by providing real-life examples to drive home their points and to get you started."
5,Must have for Creatives,"I can't rate this book highly enough! It is a must have title for any creative person involved in advertising and writing or idea generation. The writing is clear and concise and the concepts put forward are very easy to grasp. It has enhanced my way of thinking. I for one won't be lending out my copy to anyone, it's that kind of book. 10/10!"
4,It's sticking with me!,"""Better than your average business epistle, this marketing book easily translates to other area of one's life where you must communicate your thoughts and ideas in the hopes that those ideas will ""stick"". Usefull application for presentations and all kinds of talks using a simple SUCCESs formula- Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories. Aha moment around their concept of the ""curse of knowledge"" getting in the way of good communication. Replace those data bullets on your PP with quesions and allow curiousity to come before content. Our audence might just stay awake and remember what we said."" (Updated 4 minutes ago)"
4,Useful Communication Advice,Enjoyed this book and will be keeping it in my collection for future reference. Emphasis on crisp messages and refinement of language to get down to the most effective and essential message.More people should take this advice to constantly improve and refine their message until it is tight and sharp.
4,Made to Stick Review,"What is most appealing is that the authors used their own technics. Reading the book is a must because the many examples make the concepts more concrete, but the last chapter is a good quick reference.I did not buy this book on Amazon because it was an impulse purchase (apparently consistent with my reading habits) and it keeps coming up in my recommendations. I am curious if doing a review will remove it from that list without treating is non-representative of what I read."
5,Sticky is sticky!,"I had my incoming MBA class read this book before the first day of class. Their first assignment was to introduce themselves in a two-minute ""Sticky Introduction"" using the concepts from the book. The introductions were much better than usual. Further, the concepts give us a vocabulary to talk about good writing and good presentation skills for the rest of their MBA Program."
5,Small Business Owners Need to Read and Ponder This Book,"I am a solo entrepreneur. This book is amazing for getting me to better communicate what it is I do. If you tell them three things, they will remember nothing. I had three bullet points on the home page of my web site. Get people to experience the problem you are solving vs. telling them the solution. Now, I do.My business has done better since I implemented ideas from this book. Read it, ponder it and implement it in your small business."
2,This would have been better as a magazine article instead of a book,"This book has some good points, and it would have made a great article in something like ""Reader's Digest."" But a full-length book? Not so much. All of the ideas presented are s t r e t c h e d into too many pages. Then they become diluted, simple, and annoying.But the cover is cool."
1,mostly a slow moving snooze-fest,"The author does not practice what he preaches. The important point is to get to the ""core"" of your idea, simplify it enough so that the important message ""sticks"", and tell stories.Here are his two best ""sticking"" examples, so you can save your money and time. When Bill Clinton ran for president he had several important points to make, James Carville helped reduce those points down to ""It's the economy stupid"" and it stuck. The other good example was Regan's line that got him elected ""Are you better off today than you were 4 years ago?"". These were ""core"" messages that worked.The rest of the book did NOT stick. It was a mostly a slow, drawn out snooze-fest. Get anything by Seth Godin instead if you want marketing inspiration."
1,What Hypocrites!,"OK, so these guys profess to dislike slogans. And their test is, if you can put two exclamation points after it, it's a slogan. Hm, let's test that hypothesis on ""Made to Stick"". Ready? Made To Stick!! Yeah, that works! Catch my drift? They could have just called the book ""Why We Remember Some Ideas and Forget Others"" but they wanted it to sell lots of copies so they (or their publisher) came up with a catchy title, which doubtless will accomplish its objective but which negates their stance against slogans."
2,"Stick, Stuck, Stank????!!!!!!!","I'll be honest, I haven't finished this book......I'm not sure I ever will. The book doesn't stick.....ironic, huh? Chip and Dan Heath have managed to write a book about common principals: Simplicity,Unexpectedness,Concreteness,Credibility,Emotions and Stories, aka,SUCCES.Wow, revolutionary! These are principals of sales managers,writers, real estate agents, teachers, you name it, the brothers Heath have just managed to apply an acronym to these ""DUH!"" factors.This was a tough read, I found myself nodding off mid chapter. There is no new ground broken here, just a rehashing of ideas and strategies that arecommonly applied in everyday life, from the most successful entrepreneur to the soccer mom.I realize I'm not being fair by reviewing a book I didn't finish reading, but to Chip and Dan I dispense this simple advise. N.T.M.I.S.....Next time, make it stick."
4,Great Book about Branding!,This book explains how brands are developed and become famous. It's a very in depth study but explained in simple English.Worthwhile reading and offers plenty of insight and ideas!
4,Making ideas sticky so they stick better,"This is an interesting book! It defines an idea as sticky, if it is understandeable, memorable, and effective at altering behavior. In six chapters and an epilogue the book characterizes key descriptors of understandable, memorable, and effective ideas. These include: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, and ability to invoke emotional response. The authors back up their characterizations with real-life stories. A really good book!Amavilah, AuthorAmavilah, AuthorModeling Determinants of Income in Embedded EconomiesISBN: 1600210465ISBN: 1600210465"
2,good for average reader under 18,Extremely boring book. Long long examples. Whole book is a simple idea that everybody knows. This book can be summarized in 10 pages.
5,The book Stick !,"Read the book - read between the lines - take a brake - relate the content to your private and professional life ! It,s a Mind - Opener !"
4,Good read,"This book was based on a factor from Malcolm Gladwell's book The Tipping Point. Except this book decided to take a deeper dive into the principals of the Stickiness factor. Hence, what makes ideas stick to people mind. I happen to agree with Gladwell's principal and enjoyed how the authors of Made to Stick took a deeper dive into the foundation of the Stickiness factor. This book is an easy read that people can learn from. The ideas were well thought out and reinforced with fairly strong exapmles. Made to Stick could help large and small business people understand how to market to the populace. It will not make you a marketing professional but, it certainly will help point you in the right direction."
4,Worth reading,"This book is great for any business person, speaker, PR, advertising executive, teacher, and trainer - anyone who wants to be remembered. I even took notes. I will design my presentations differently after reading this book. Definitely worth the purchase. I will be passing it along at the office."
4,Essential reading for the young (and old) entreprenuer,"Just picked this up after about, oh, 20 recommendations from friends...what a read! If you want to learn how to make your idea memorable, your business successful, your wedding invitations enticing, or just how to get peoples' attention - you need this book."
1,The book really does not stick,"It is not an interesting book as it is supposed to be by his title and table of contents. It could have been shorter (to follow its first advise), to be more provocative (to follow its second) and so on. The authors should rewrite it... following their own rules."
1,Too much information & Not Sticky,"This book is way too long. They could have written the whole book in one third it's volume to make it simple. The writers need to be effective. They talk about techniques like being simple, unexpected, concrete,credible, emotional& stories. However they seem to be totally lost in the countless useless information. Context is good but needs improvement on content. Definitely not recommended."
4,Good set of instructions,"Really let's me think about how I can craft my own sticky idea. I had a hard time staying engrossed because of how short each subsection was, but that is really a issue with the organization of the book, not its content. I recommend this for anyone looking to not only get better at their jobs, but simply trying to improve their ability to communicate with others."
5,Great for helping package important ideas so they are heard and remembered,"I make my living helping people learn new ways of working. So understanding how to make concepts and ideas more compelling and, importantly, how to get people to remember and act on them is key to what I do. This book is filled with practical advice and examples to help those of us who must communicate well in both speaking and writing. The fact is, with so many messages, it is the presentation and delivery rather than the content that ""hooks"" people. This book gives great advice and techniques to help presenters have the best chance possible of being heard and remembered."
4,Read it twice,"Here's a confession. I read this book twice. Oh, I know what you're thinking. How sticky could it be, if I had to read it again? The answer is that it's not very. Nonetheless, the book is really worthwhile reading, and an excellent reference after you've read it, at least twice. Though presented in a easy, breezy fashion by the brothers Heath, the book's insights are really profound. For example, the more we know about a subject, the more we presume our listener knows. The Heaths call it the curse of knowledge. Honing your message so it frames an issue in a sticky way is hard work. This book won't necessarily give you a short cut to glory, but it will help you identify hazards. If you want people to get the message, do it with a Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Emotional Story. Of course, it's an acronym. Always remember: make it sticky, or they'll forget it quickly."
5,This is why Malcolm Gladwell is such a great writer,"This is an excellent outline on how you can communicate an idea (anyone's idea, not necessarily yours) effectively. The Heath brothers credit Malcolm Gladwell for ""The Stickiness Factor"" element that drives the book and it certainly reads like an offshot/complement to ""The Tipping Point."" (As a matter of fact, I'd say its breakdown demonstrates why Gladwell is such a great writer.)The book itself follows its own guidelines by giving concise and credible stories throughout its chapters. It's a fairly easy read and the clinics included in some of the chapters help to solidify the ideas they present."
4,Six Principles are Fundamental to Viral Philosophy,"""WOW! Love spreading the six principles to the seminars I give on how to make your message memorable! Following the methodology of how urban legends fly and are remembered, the Heath brothers present the principles as the easiest way to replicate the speed at which sticky stories go viral. A virus we all want! GREAT BOOK and GREAT RESOURCE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS!"""
5,sticks with you,"Why did the duct tape cross the road? To stick with you, too. A most worthwhile book. If you ever need to sell an idea, sell yourself, or sell a product, this will give you ideas that will stick with you."
3,"Interesting, but...","Made to Stick was an interesting read with some great stories but I found the book difficult to translate into actionable practices. I hoped for a bit more 'what you can do' steps instead of a storybook. However, the summary at the end of the book was good."
3,All makes sense - but misses the unexpectedness,"This book has tried hard to emulate ""The Tipping Point"" - the authors admit that too - but it falls short of being or bringing the very essence of 'unexpected' that the authors preach. Reading the contents of the book leave very little to chance what you might expect in subsequent chapters.The book is divided into chapters like simple, credible, unexpected, stories etc. which can sometimes slow you down if the next chapter, say 'credible' does not particularly interest you.Books like the ""The Tipping Point"" or ""The Blink"" or ""Freakonomics"" do a better job of sticking to the principles described in ""Made to Stick"" than the book itself."
4,Book Review,"This book has been very well researched and has some excellent content. It is a little ""slow"" in some areas but is overall a good resource for product/service marketing. It certainly opens up some perspectives regarding personal perceptions and I haven't considered before."
4,great ideas to think about,"I read this book because of numerous recommendations. The take-aways are not obvious at first, but I've been able to see how they apply to what I'm working on with a little work. Ideas can be applied to marketing, writing, blogging, photography, song-writing, etc."
5,Too Sticky to Put Down,"I read this book three times in the first week I had it. It is an amazingly comprehensive and practical look at the power of persuasion. This is not just theory - it's about practical application that can be used by a company, a salesperson, or anyone who needs a competitive edge via persuasion. I will refer to this book again and again."
2,30 minutes of content spread over 336 pages,"While this book has some great stuff in it, there isn't that much - you could cover the entire contents of the book over one cup of coffee in Starbucks. Buy a used copy for $2.95 + shipping."
5,Sticky Book on Stickiness,"I adore this book and not just because of the cool duct-tape cover. It should be required reading for anyone in the business of persuasion (that includes entrepreneurs, marketing and sales pros, teachers, writers, and many more). It's an entertaining read that's full of terrific stories and examples to illustrate the authors' points."
4,Innovation Manager,"The book delivered on its claims. These concepts can be applied to selling a new idea, product or service both internally and externally. For a company that has very traditional marketing techniques it would be very helpful to pass this along to the marketing and communications staff so that they can shift their paradigms and embrace these concepts."
5,Made to stick,"I found this book very valuable so I gave it as a gift to a close friend, I missed having it, so I bought another copy. A must have in any intelectual's library."
5,Create the perfect sticky sales pitch to capture an employer's imagination!,"In a world where we are bombarded by messages every second, having the know-how to create a message that stands out above the rest is a serious asset. `Made to Stick' is a book by Chip and Dan Heath, brothers who researched psychosocial studies on the memory, emotion and motivation.The Heath brothers found that six basic qualities enable an idea to stick in our minds; these are: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories.Once you have mastered this communication skill, the world is your oyster. A job seeker can create a resumé and cover letter to stand out above the rest. An entrepreneur will have their ideas heard loud and clear.Danny InyAuthor of the free eBook ""Forget Everything You Know About Looking For a Job... And Actually Find One!""HuntingToHired, www.HuntingToHired.com"
4,Finger lickin',A surprisingly edible little book. It pretty much lives out its own meaning. It's stickyish. You do remember more of its nostrums than other books of this type. And you do sometimes find yourself pursuading others in new ways that could have been shaped by some of its exhortations. It is a good gloss on one of the more delicious aspects of the full confection: The Tipping Point. It's worth 4 jelly stars.
3,"not bad, but no ""tipping point""","This has the same format and style as ""The Tipping Point"" or ""Blink"" (scientific study mixed in with anecdotal stories and examples) but not nearly as well-written or well-researched. I enjoyed parts of it, but overall was disappointed in comparison."
3,Sticky,I bought the audio book and have enjoyed parts of it. It is a 8 disc set that should be a 4 disc set. There is a lot of stretch and fill going on but I did get some content keepers out of it. I do not regret the purchase.
4,Great Book on Idea Stickiness,"Unfortunately, the brothers Heath give a nod to Malcolm Gladwell's ""Tipping Point"" as the basis for this book, but this book is very good. It is principally about how good ideas can be created (crafted) such as to enhance their sticking power in peoples' minds. With great real-world examples the reasons behind great marketing ideas can be scrutinized. A must-read for those interested in marketing, sales, consumer behavior, or behavioral psychology."
5,Great fun!,"The Max books spark the imagination with a captivating tale while sneakily teaching science at the same time! Beautifully written and illustrated, they will please for many years."
5,real science and fun too!,"This is a great book. My almost 5 year old son keeps asking for it over and over again. Unlike most ""real science"" books, it has both scientific explanations for things like gravity and the phases of the moon, but also tells a narrative fictional story. As a parent, it's very helpful to have all the answers right there on the same page when your child asks, what is gravity? We can't wait for the next Max book."
5,Two Thumbs Up for Max!!,"It is so hard to find a picture book for younger children that not only keeps their interest, but teaches science at the same time...Mr. Bennett has done a fabulous job doing both. The children love Max and all of his adventures!! A must have for every child interested in learning more about the the solar system!!"
2,Not what I expected,This book was not what I was expecting. The cover leads you to believe there are great color illustrations of many banners inside but there are not. Very diappointing.
2,This book is FOR BEGINNERS,I just received this book and one glance through it makes me wish I hadn't ordered it. This book is definietly for beginners.
3,If I could actually watch it I'd give it 5 stars...,"This is the third time I've purchased this set and each time it fails to work in my DVD, it must be a defective manufacturing run...so now I have three copies of it, all useless. I absolutely love the rest of the series and consider it to be one of the high points of Canadian Television...but right now I can only review it in terms of it packaging. It comes in a standard sturdy DVD box with a clear crisp graphic on the front with my favorite Newsroom characters all featured, causing me to yearn all the more for the actual program. Not much more to say beyond this except that I'm really a bit ticked off at CBC productions quality control..."
3,Good Book for Java Programmers,I am a Sun Java Certified Programmer and I have read and used Spell's book with profit.It is a book addressed more to people that already have a good grasp of Java and some programming experience.It is not a book for learning Java as it does not cover Java basics but only advanced topics.It is more focused on applications programming than on client-server enterprise programming.It is not a book to use for passing Java certifications as it contains some errors that can confuse you more than help you.Nevertheless it is a worth-reading book for Java programmers that want to enhance their skills.Rather overpriced though for what it gives.
3,"Good, but not top notch","This book certainly covers many important topics in a clear and well written manner. You will find excellent and very clear advice to follow. My only gripe with this book is its rather lengthy treatment of Swing. Swing is covered in enough detail to give you a flavor, but that's all. In total the coverage of swing takes up a lot of pages, and makes the book a bit too thick to read comfortably in bed. Without the Swing part I think it would have been possible to have this book as a bedside companion."
4,The island monkey,"This book is really good. It is sorta boring at the beginning, but its good at the end. My favorite part is when they took the monkey to the zoo, and got chased. I think you should read this book because its about a monkey that has a big effect on a girl. I would recommend this book to you."
4,Great carrier!!,Great carrier. Lots of room for my malti-poo. Its a little on the heavy side and with a 10 pound dog in the carrier its even heavier. But otherwise it looks great and my do LOVED it. Perfect size for under the seats on Delta Airlines. ( I purchased the med)
1,Barely 18 inches long,"I opened this package and was shocked at how small this ""large"" bag is. I placed a yardstick next to it and it measured just under 18 inches long. The product description and box say 20 inches. Also, the opening on top is very small -- I did not even attempt to fit my large tuxedo cat in here -- this is a rip off."
1,Would not recommend!,"I bought this item for my 10 lb dog for a trip on the airline. It lasted there and back, but as soon as we made it back the straps broke."
5,great fit! good quality and price.,"Great fit for my 9 lbs cat! Plenty of room for kitty to move around, fit underneath the airplane seat with no problem. The shearling liner adds extra comfort and is easily removed for cleaning! Can't beat the price at any of the pet stores."
1,TopGrading? How 'bout DEgrading?,More psychobabble for the workplace. I may have to plan a festive bonfire just to burn this book. It gets 1 star for nice fonts and good spelling.
3,"Very interested, until...","After reading the reviews of this book, I wanted it...but there's one hesitation.One company the marketers of the book hold up as an example of why the author's work is effective is GE. In my opinion, and in the opinion of many I've spoken with in my world, GE's products are not superior...so this makes me wonder"
1,Do not waste your money.,The ability to make good decisions regarding people represents one of the last reliable sources of competitive advantage. This book does not give you any useful and/or practical information. The author of this book is arrogant and needs to take some English writing lessons. Do not waste your money.
4,topgrading,I do beleive in the concept but the approach they outline is too time consuming and expensive for me. Topgrading is a great way to go but other tools may get you there - try JudgmentIndex.com for a simple tool
4,Great Technical Reference,I enjoyed this read although very technical for relationship management. The book is fantastic for the approach of hiring the correct people and raising the bar with ideas to increase current employee productivity. I would reccomed reading for any and all managers from small groups to large organizations. I manage a team of Insurance Recruiters based in Dallas and reference the book atleast weekly.Jason Simmons972-960-1305x126[...]
5,An Actionable Handbook,"I am the leader of a multimillion dollar consulting organization and although we specialize in marketing I will say one of the biggest issues our clients have is how to hire the right people. I have taken to literally carrying copies of Topgrading in my car and it is a required resource for all my consultants. We use many of the Topgrading forms and scripts in helping our clients to hire ""A"" Players. The Chronological In-Depth Structured (CIDS) interview approach provides a very solid foundation toward this goal. We strongly recommend Topgrading for all managers since making the wrong hiring decision can be fatal. What's most powerful about the book is that Dr. Smart manages to define things in simple terms and motivates the reader to implement immediately. Get this one."
2,Beware,"Be very careful using some of the information in this book or you risk creating an HR nightmare for your company. Ford Motor Company is in the process of defending itself against law suites brought on by employees who have been exposed to the ""A, B, and C, Player,"" environment. The Top Grading system is viewed by many as arbitrary, unfair, and discriminatory. Even the most vocal practitioners of this system, General Electric, will admit the process can destroy moral."
2,disappointed,"I was under the impression that this was a paperback version of the book but instead it was a summary of the book. It gave a lot of generalities but was not specific at all. If you are looking for a ""Cliff's Notes"" version then this book will probably serve the purpose. If you want specifics, then you need to buy the hard cover book."
5,Topgrading Works!,"Dr. Smart has provided the definitive guide on how to acquire and retain elite talent. His approach is not only logical and well researched, but also highly practical. Dr. Smart does not simply develop a thesis and encourage the reader to figure out how to make it work for his or her company. Instead, this book provides all of the tools necessary for successful implementation of the ""Topgrading"" strategies.CEO's should require their vice president of human resources and all senior managers to read Topgrading, and then read it again and again and again...."
5,"Topgrading, a must read for every manager","Although I had a lot of training in GE, this book really helped me further in understanding the logic behind grading employees.It is so easy to underestimate or to ignore the importance of top grading. This book opened my eyes again and got me really started. Not only in top grading, but also looking at my personal carrier. A must read for everyone who want to start or grow (within) a successful business."
2,Ruthless and scary,"Great for tips and forms that help you interview more effectively, if you can find candidates who don't mind spending a few hours in a single interview. I found the author's tone harsh and condescending. If you want permission to be a ruthless manager, you'll love this book. If you are a ""kinder gentler"" boss that cheers on employees and encourages greatness rather than a staunch disciplinarian you may find this book less than useful overall."
1,Complete waste of money.,A help-yourself book that doesn't supply what it promised. The author uses patronizing language. Presents some 'magic formulas' to recruit people. Lifted from reality. Has some very good forms useful for interviewers. Has a very clean and clear format that ease reading. To sum it: an overpriced junk book.
5,It really works!!!,"Not only have I read both releases of this book, but my colleagues and I have been practicing Topgrading at my company for some time now. By using Dr. Smart's process, we have had significant success in hiring A players and have reaped the rewards of having these high powered recruits on our staff. This is a ""must read"" for those leaders that want to significantly improve the quality of their workforce."
5,"My secret is ""Topgrading""","No matter the reason why you haven't read this book, jettison those reasons and get this gem. Want even more powerful leadership skills? Also check out ""Good to Great,"" ""Crucial Conversations,"" and ""The Toyota Way."" I, along with the entire plant staff, got a copy of this book.Pro:-Describes A, B, C players using new insights-Explains how C players destroy businesses and how they propagate through an organization-Astonishing detail on how to hire only A Players and how to conduct interviewsCon:-None that I can find.Bottom line: I've been approached by seasoned managers, including an HR manager asking for my ""secret"". Well, my secret is ""Topgrading."" I highly recommend this book as one of a handful must reads for the busy manager. I guarantee that you'll not be disappointed."
1,Do not waste your money,"Do not buy this book. It is waste of money. It appears the author's main reason for writing this book was to brag about himself, himself and himself. Perhaps it will be very useful, if he could take some writing lessons before trying to write his next book."
5,Very best country collection on just a few cds!,"I have all the time life country as well as some more, around 900 old country classic songs. Most of them that I did not have before are issued on these series 1-4. I would buy it, even if it costs a lot now. Great old style country, from good vocal classics to fantastic banjo solo's!It should be re released!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"This Birds of Prey trade contains stories that are a bit weaker than those that have come before, I think, and don't gel as well.There is the undercover Huntress part, where she runs into Vixen. That is ok. Out of nowhere though, we have Brainiac interacting with Oracle, among other things.It is still ok, just not as good as the rest."
4,Something for Everyone,"I laughed, I cried, I was taken on an adventure. It appealed to my love of things medieval...to my enjoyment of fantasy...and a desire to be taken to another time another world. The author has mixed lovable characters with strong heroes...memorable women and evil villians with skill. There was one foot in reality so that a reader could immerse themself with conviction. But there was always a wonderful twist around every corner. I very often felt like a fly on the wall...he created such vivid scenes that put you right there in the story."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on,"I purchased this looking for a basic overview of Italian reunification that accounted for recent scholarship. What I got was a string of primary documents connected by useless one to five page historical introductions. I have no qualms about presenting primary evidence, but to simply present it without any analysis or historical commentary is crimminal. I can't imagine what segment of the book market would find this useful. High schoolers need basic historical explanation alongside primary documents. College students need analytic meat. And experts would have no use for such a simple collection of primary material. My only consolation is that I found this used -the new price is scandalous. I am thoroughly disappointed with this publication, not to mention with palgrave, who have done the book world a disservice."
2,Disappointed,"I had the spincast combo kit shipped to Louisiana because I was going to spend 10 days with my mother. My mother loves to fish and she had told me we would be doing some fishing. My brother told me the line on the reel was rotten. I thought I had gotten my line hung on something when I had a bite and the line broke. The rod was o.k. and the reel performed well, but the line must have been very old and dried-out."
4,"Not Physical,but still Good","Eventough Soulkiss wasn't crtically acclaimed, ""soulkiss""the single did fairly well at the charts reaching #20.I think it's unfair that the cd wasn't a sucess,at least 5 of the ten songs are real Olivia songs such as emotional tangle,the right moment and a few others.The other 5 were perhaps more raunchy than we are used from Livvey but certainley not less beautiful,Olivia's voice is still crystal clear and the most beautiful one on earth,this cd is recommanded to all fans,and people who enjoy beautiful music."
3,"Olivia's last ""Sandy 2"" album","Olivia seemed to take her sexy image as far as it would go and the result is Soul Kiss. Olivia has said that this is her favorite album, but one wonders if it is because she was happily married and found out she was pregnant at the time of release of this collection. ""Soul Kiss""(backed by ""Married with Children's"" Katey Sagel) is a really good song, as is ""Emotional Tangle"", ""Moth to a Flame"", ""The Right Moment"" and I love ""Driving Music"".....the rest of the album is kind of okay(nothing truely awful, except the dreadful ""Culture Shock"" which is kind of catchy, but really stupid)......this album also suffers from the same over synthesized sound of most albums of this era......John Farrar has done a much better production job for Olivia(Physical, the Xanadu Soundtrack, etc), but he does okay here."
3,"""Soul Kiss"" too sexy for the good girl next door.","As a long time ONJ fan, I have to admit that the 1985 ""Soul Kiss"" was not Olivia's best work. The album photos and raunchy lyrics went too far in terms of promoting a blatant sensuality. The public was not willing to see ONJ in such a sleazy light. You have to wonder how she has explained this embarrassment of an album to her teenage daughter Chloe. Mommy was definitely trying too hard to be a 1980's sex kitten. That was better off left to Madonna. The best tracks are ""Emotional Tangle"" and ""The Right Moment"" This album is worth adding to your ONJ music collection, just don't pay full retail price for it. Pick up 1987's ""Rumour"" album for the REAL Olivia Newton- John."
2,Livvy Tries to be Queen of Kink (AND FAILS!!),"This (as another reviewer said) proved to be ONJ's kiss of death to her career. The CD was embarassing. The title track was so badly produced it sounded like half way through the song you switched over radio stations. ""Toughen Up"" was a Tina Turner reject. (there's a reason why singers reject songs and 99% of the time they are right). Culture shock is well..Downright stupid. Queen of the Publication is ""Well what is it??"" The only stand out is ""The Right Moment."" ""Moth to a Flame"" is minor hit single material and ""Overnight Observation"" is fun but that's it.ONJ tried to be sexy and kinky but couldn't pull it off. She is the girl next store. NOT THE QUEEN OF KINK. Madonna had that role. And Sheena Easton for all her comparison to ONJ could pull of sexy. Livvy you are my favorite but this CD is what killed your career."
1,SOUL KISS OFF,A HORRIBLE ALBUM EXCEPT FOR THE BRIAN WILSON SONG. TERRIBLE MATERIAL FOR SUCH A PRETTY VOICE. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR HER OTHER ALBUMS. YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID. I SUFFERED FOR YOU.
4,NICE ALBUM,"A very fun album from olivia. I can't say the lyrics are the best I mean some of the subject matter here is a little weird but overall the album is very well produced and olivias voice sounds excellent especially in the haunting ""The right moment"".a great way to close this album.Other standouts are ""Moth to a flame"" ""Culture shock"" I love the music on this one and ""Emotional Tangle"" let's loose the tenderness of livvys vocals.I think it is a great album to lay back relax and forget about the worlds problems. I reccomend you buy the import version which includes "" Electric""its a nice track. I look foward to buying more from her so if you like good old pop music from the 80s buy it!!!......"
5,Cuckold dream,Cuckold heaven indeed; 'Culture Shock' where sexy old Livvy tells her husband that she's in love with another man and then states in no uncertain terms that he'll be her's no matter what...and then says he should also move in. Whoa...
3,Love Olivia...not the album.,"I am a HUGE Olivia fan but this album represents the one lull in my fandom.Just before, Olivia had recorded some amazing tracks with David Foster for the Two of A Kind Soundtrack and she should've hooked up with him for this. She then followed this with her AMAZING album, The Rumour. This was the wrong thing to stick in between.She sounds great, she looks even better, but the songs are overly sensational to the point of being forced. If you buy, there are some fine songs (Emotional Tangle, Soul Kiss) but overall it's not a very ""Olivia"" album. Buy it if your a fan to complete your collection.For a crtically acclaimed and absolutely amazing album, buy The Rumour from 1988."
5,Easy Setup Great Wireless,"Had no problems setting this up, 5 minutes and I was changing the password and setting up the encryption. Default is setup for DHCP so make sure the patch cable is connected to your DHCP Server/Router before powering up the unit.Wireless is great, no problems with range I have the unit in the basement while I am on the 1st floor and the speed is as good as my wired LAN while surfing the web.Very happy."
2,Terrible Product,"I have had a lot of trouble with this product, and I am in the process of returning mine. Here are my biggest complaints: (1) access point requires Windows-based manager for configuration. A simple web or telnet based client would be more portable and more reliable. (2) The Window-based manager is buggy and often crashes. (3) I need to POWER-CYCLE my access point every 24 hours -- otherwise it maxes out at 6 KB/sec data transmission....."
3,ONJ's early output proves to be just as admirable as later hits...,"Minus a few pop hooks, Livvy's early selections are winning and airy, if slight, country-lite performances. Her cover of Bob Dylan's ""If Not for You"" (an unlikely match-up!) was her first actual hit, and despite a repetitous twang, it's very pretty. ""Banks of the Ohio"" is a little bit out of Olivia's grasp, but John Denver's ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" is right up her alley. ""Let Me Be There"", ""If You Love Me (Let Me Know)"" and ""I Honestly Love You"" are here to snag hits-listeners, and they still sound great after these many years, but it's the other, less heard songs which grabbed me. A minor collection, to be certain, but an entirely pleasant one."
4,nice for this price,"I scrimped and scraped some 20 years ago to purchase this. Alas, it is a fairly ordinary but pleasant, long lasting and sweet vanilla-type perfume. Think drugstore vanilla fragrances. I would categorize it as mostly a winter/evening/romantic scent. Enjoyed it, but paid too much. I see the price is more in line with reality these days. Enjoy."
1,Received a bad or fake perfume,"I ordered Casmir by Chopard from Amazon. It smelled terrible, nothing like the scent I know it to be, which is an oriental vanilla. This smells like I'm wearing an ashtray.The Casmir that I received from Amazon was supposed to be new, however I don't believe mine was. It was not covered in plastic wrap, and it looked like some of the perfume was used, besides the point of it smelling horrible.I had read negative reviews on Amazon about this perfume being fake or bad. I noticed on Amazon's website that it is advertised as a new arrival, so I thought that perhaps Amazon has taken care of this matter. Well, let me just say it is not the real Casmir by Chopard. The real Casmir smells wonderful. My advice if you would like to purchase this perfume, is to get it elsewhere. I have ordered other perfumes from Amazon, and this is the first time I've experience this issue. So hopefully this will not become a continual problem."
5,I smell like a dream!,"I've actually worn this for longer than I care to admit, but nothing matches it. It's elegant, sophisticated & unmistakeably sexy."
2,Disappointed in the scent of Casmir,"I have been using Casmir for years but the last two bottles I purchased have had a different scent than I am used to. They almost seem like the perfume is old. Casmir was always a long lasting scent and the longer you wore it, the better it smelled. This perfume is not long lasting and it doesn't have as much vanilla in it as before. I am not sure what is going on with this perfume but I am very disappointed since this was always my favorite scent and I wore it all the time. I will not purchase this perfume again."
1,Stinky stuff,"You were all right when many of you said this perfume stinks and that it may be turned. It gave me an immediate headache, is very strong, smells horrible, turned dark yellow or orange and I can tell it is bad. How anyone can think this is a good quality perfume is beyond me. Some of you here said they loved it so I took a chance. And I can't return it b/c its flammable? OMG what a waste of money!"
5,Chopard Casmir,"I am constantly receiving compliments on how ""good"" I smell whenever I wear Casmir. I have had friends, as well as many strangers inquire into the name of the perfume that I was wearing. Men & women seem to love it equally. I usually have about 10 different perfumes that I choose from at any given time depending on my mood, but Chopard Casmir & Chopard Wish are my absolute favorites! Althought you will want to save this exotic oriental scent for special occasions, you can actually wear it anytime. Casmir's scent also lasts remarkably longer than almost any other perfume that I have tried."
2,casmir,"i've always loved this perfume and was disappointed when they stopped selling it in dept stores. when i found it online i was so happy, but it doesn't smell the same as i remember. i was so excited when i received it but i only used it a couple of times. its almost like its old. it smells like cigarette ashes. it may be so old that the fragrance is gone and all is left is alcohol. or maybe it's a knockoff."
3,Smell fades fast,"I have normally purchased this product at a retail location, but no one carries it anymore! I was pleased to find it on Amazon! However, the scent disappears quickly. I am not sure if it is watered down a bit or not, but it doesn't last as long as I remember it did. It is a beautiful fragrance, very warm and sensual. It has notes of vanilla, which I just love. I would recommend buying the Casmir body lotion along with this EDP so that it will last a bit longer."
5,deelish,I have been wearing this scent since mid 90's. I love it. Use it sparingly. The body creme is the best but its no longer being manufactured....I like it as a winter scent as Im a Dolce Garbana Lite blue fan come spring.summer
4,Whoa.,"I was impressed by this book for many reasons, it not only gives interesting details on how Jim Morrison became the..strange man that he was, but it also details in perfect chronology the hits and failures of the Doors in the mediums of film, books and records. It also offers many theories on Morrison's death, (although, for a better look, I'd recommend Rolling Stone's new article, revolations on the last days of jim morrison).This book is easy to read for the most part, but sometimes it isn't extremely clear. For example, I wish it would have gone over his death for more than a few pages, and in some parts of the book it just feels like you're reading a bunch of old magazine articles about the doors.It is overall a good read even if you aren't a doors fan, even if you think Morrison was a drunkard posing as a poet. Very good."
4,the lizard king!,"although this is the only autobiography of jim morrison that ive read,i think it does a good job of detailing his life from a young boy to a musician and finally to a burnt out musician.it tells his life how he lived it.not glamarous but tragic.it should of been called ""the rise and fall of jim morrison"".even though he would be drunk or high most of the time,he convinced you that he was a genius and that he was right about everything no matter what people said.it also tells you of all his girlfriends he had and how he treated them.on one occasion,it tells you how in the studio his girlfriend performed fellatio on him while he was recording a track.jim morrison lived a fast life and many people criticized him all the time for what he did on his shows and how he acted.no matter what people say about him he still rocks!"
3,A Drunk or A Hero,"I had read this book and i have come to be even better of a fan of the late Jim Morrison. I can connect with the way he acts and I can connect with some of the stunts he pulls. However, this book was poorly written. I loved the start but,towards the end it got extremely boring. I had to keep flipping back to the funny parts during the book just to stay interested. Hopefully the other books on his life are a little more interesting."
5,a good one,"this book really takes you into the life of jim morrison. it doesn't just depicts the media's image of him, it also tells how the people closest to him reacted to his bizarre behavior. he was a genius before his time."
4,Great Book,This was a very detailed account of Jim's life before the Doors and up until his death. VERY captivating read. I recommend it.
4,Full of content - lacking vision,"While long on details, stories, incidents and daily dramas, there seems to be no overall theme to this otherwise excellent book.This was a page-turner, and while fascinated with the events around Morrision, I did not get an overall sense of his place in the world he occupied, not even a clue from those closest to him.Perhaps those he was closest to found him so frustrating as a person although brilliant as a poet, they therefore aren't in a position to gauge his impact on the artistic world. Ultimately, that's what some of those of us - who only grew up with his legend - want to read about in addition to the day to day foibles, heartbreaks and occasional laughs."
5,Highly Interesting!,"After reading this book, I felt i knew every drug invented:) ..including his music. I was so addicted to this book i read it twice. It's excellent!"
3,A good chronicle of events but not about the man,"This book accounts for the life and times of ol' Jimbo, but doesn't really tell us much about the man and his real psyche. I think the events and anecdotes are pretty accurate, but during the whole read we don't really learn much except some dry information. Morrison was definitely an intelligent man and much different than some of the posers passing for rock artists these days. His mind and music ran deeper than most and this book didn't really do him justice. I give it three stars for basic content though."
4,Took Me Through,"I must say the book started off slow...or perhaps the stuff that was mentioned was so the stuff that every doors fan already knows....but the ending had a nice mixture of music, life, and love...and sort of left you wanting to believe that there was this slight possibility that jim was still out there...waiting to get together one more time. i give the authors credit, this book did keep me interested and added some flavor to my morning train commute."
2,Can't get out of this one with any Morrison insight,"The insight into Jim Morrison in ""No One Here Gets Out Alive"" is as shallow as Grandma's pool. It consists of a couple of rock star cliches: Morrison gets drunk a lot, has fun with his groupies, and uses more drugs than Marion Barry.Even if we give the authors plaudits for stating these obvious Mojo facts, there is no cogent analysis into why an arguably brilliant mind has such a pattern of self-destruction. Maybe there isn't a brilliant answer to why Mojo read Rimbaud, Balzac, and wrote poetry, but the authors should tell that to us. Don't just trot out literary legends to satisfy your ""personal belief that Jim Morrison was a god.""Two stars. Not a total waste of money if you're interested in some hangers-on writing down their prayers at Morrison's altar, but if you've got somethin' for history, you won't get out of this one alive."
4,Great novel. Poorly written.,"When I look at the Doors and Jim Morrison I see some of the most physicadelic people on Earth. Reading this novel truly gave me an insight on Morrison's mind, from his childhood to his demise. Reading this I learned how he was thought of as a hero by the public and a drunken frat-boy by his friends and bandmates. I loved this novel and I loved learning of the life of Jim Morrison.However, this is not an amazingly written novel. You see, The Doors made amazing music; Hopkins and Sugerman do not make the most suffisticated novels. For instance, one of Morrison's acid trips on stage will be described at the beggining of a paragraph and then a night on the town with his soul mate a month later will be described at the end.Reading NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE is truly a stimulating experience. That is , if you can get past these written mistakes. I sugget you buy this novel."
5,Excellence in Research of the Lizard King,"I wanted to write a little note to say that I thought it is one of the best biography I have ever read. It is well researched and written. The chance to read about Jim Morrison and form your own opinion instead of the author guiding you to one, is great. I have read the book several times and continue to tell my dad each time that he did a great job in writing it."
4,A basic information for a doors fan,"I'm a Mexican fan of The Doors and i think that this book includes some views unknown of Jim and the band. For example: i didn't know that they were in Mexico City on 1970 in the Plaza Mexico I sincerely recommend it for every fan that wants to ""break on through to the other side""."
5,The Real Jim,"Great book!!! If you believe that Jim Morrison is how he was showed in Oliver Stone's movie, You should read this book. It shows the real Jim, not a perfect man, but a fascinating man, with his problems, crisis, thoughts, weaknesses and brightness."
2,Nice Piece of Fiction,"There are better books out there like John Tobler's book and Jerry Reardon's ""Break on Through."" I probably would've given this book 5 stars back in 83 when I first read itSugarman's book is entertaining and I give this book credit for helping perpetuate the Doors legend, but it reads like fiction and the dialogues are unbelievable. It made Sugarman, who clams Morrison took him under his wing at 13 (!?), a rich man."
4,Short and Concise,"I've read a few Morrsion biographies, and this might be my favorite. The real appeal of this one is the length- a little over 300 pages in a handy paperback, as opposed to a bible like ""Break On Through"". If you have only a passing interest in Morrison and the Doors, this is probably the best biography. However, if you want a more deatailed portrayal of Jim, with more background information, and can stick with a longer book, I would suggest ""Break On Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison"". But even for seasoned Doors/Morrison fans, this is a good read."
4,it was alright,"i'm not an expert on the group or the man so i dunno how this book rates with the others, but it wasn't bad."
5,Greatest book on Jim Morrison of all time!,"In my opinion this is the greatest book on Jim Morrison of all time, and there will never be a greater book to expand your knowledge of what really happened back in the 60's/70's with the doors. This book is a definate for all doors lovers"
5,This book is a MUST READ and I wish there were more!,I read this book when it was first published and it is as good now as it was then! I recommend it to anyone who likes action and adventure mixed with romance and mystery. The characters are strong and will make the story come alive for you.
4,like it,This is a book no longer printed and I like the the stories this author wrote so I decided to collect all 5 books.
1,Alligator Creek,"This book is the worst I've ever read. It is nothing but a collection of poorly written 'sexcapades', including pedophilia and tricks. The author should devote herself to a worthwhile endeavor."
2,Not quite what I was looking for.,"As the owner of a new baby Congo African Grey parrot, I wanted to learn about how best to care for one. This book came highly rated, so I purchased it and read it. In general I found the layout of the book and its pictures to be very good. In terms of actual hands on help, I unfortunately found it to be lacking for my purposes.The book spent a great deal of time on the construction and placement of outdoor aviaries, as well as breeding activities, so if one is looking for such information, then this book might be a good source of such. My intention was to have a companion indoor bird, which, I believe, is the intention of most potential owners of these birds.As a retired clinical geneticist, I found some of the genetics discussions to be lacking. In addition, the book was published in 1995, and, as such, some of material is somewhat dated."
2,Keeping African Gray Parrots,Nice photos but the material in the book is out of date. Many more books are available now that are more informative.
5,guitar + erhu sounds great!,"Tak Matsumoto, the only Asian guitarist to date that owns two signature Les Paul Gibsons, is also song-writer and guitarist of B'z, Japan's best-selling rock band to date. They have been around for 15 years and is hailed as an evergreen band.HANA features more of the musician and song-writer side of Tak. Koi Uta and Hana, both songs boast beautiful Oriental melody. Who would have guessed that electric guitar and er-hu (ancient Chinese instrumental) combines so well! You would be charmed by Tak's choice of melody and his improvisation skill in all songs. Besides Koi Uta and Hana, I also love #1090, Midosuji Blue, Romeo & Juliet, Engaged and 2011.For more rocking Tak though, I would recommend any B'z works like Brotherhood or Eleven. The guitar playing is simply MAD!"
4,Hard to find item,I couldn't find this item anywhere else on the internet except for amazonand have been completely satisfied with the service.
1,Even More Disappointed...,"I wish I had read the above review before I spent my money on this book. I think if someone is going to sell an identification ""guide"" for a specific category of goods and they are only going to cover a representative selection of that category, they should at least be honest about it on the cover. The cover of this one should say ""If you only need a few photos from each manufacturer and you don't need makers' marks to help you IDENTIFY your silver, then this book is for you!!!"""
5,"Warman's ""Sterling Silver Flatware Value & Identification Guide""",This book happens to be laying on my business desk at this moment because of the frequency of its use. It is an invaluable resource and guide for Sterling patterns and values. My business sells a lot of silver and couldn't do without this research book.
3,good for a beginning,"easy to follow and while this does not have hallmarks or much history, does carry clear pictures of standard patterns and makers. Good for a start and considering how little is out there, not bad."
4,Almost perfect,"I like Emilie-Claire's singing a lot. She has a great voice and great style. I'd rate the album five stars except for two minor flaws. The remix of the title tune doesn't work, and the keyboard playing on some tracks is undistinguished and redundant."
4,The Rebel,"I found this book to be a great insight into the hiden world of the outlaw biker. although the writer uses 50 cent words to discribe the dirty bearded, rough and tumble biker; there is a feeling of looking at the outlaw from inside his world... I recommend this book for the motorcyclist who is looking to join any club or is just out riding in the outlaws world."
4,A decent read...,for anyone unfamiliar with the MC world. A few nuggets and items of interest. I'd probably recommend it to any newbies.
2,"Read Sonny's book, its more realistic","Well, the book was written by an ""friend"" of the club (at the time), so he was not privy to most of the club business. However, the author spent his time with the Rebels in the late 70's, and very early 80's, so his analysis is very dated.I prospected with the club in the late 80's, and it was a VERY different club by the time the book was published. And as of the late 90's, the Rebels Motor Cycle club no longer exist. Many of the former members now belonging to the Edmonton, Calgary, and Saskatoon Chapters of the Hells Angels MC.The book is slow to read, and overly analytical. It was originally the author's thesis, so, unless you're a sociology or anthropology student, you'll get bored. Read Sonny's book, its more real."
5,AMAZING OUTLOOK ON THE INSIDE LIFE OF GANG RELATED BIKERS,IF ONE EVER WANTED TO LEARN ANYTHING ON BIKERS PORTRAYED BY AN OUTSIDER WHO BECAME AN INSIDER (AND WAS NOT A COP) THIS IS THE BOOK.
5,Great sports betting info and history.,"I agree. This book is the definitive sports betting thing. I read the whole book straight through. Great for netheads and sports freaks and all degenerates who love to gamble or want to know about this funky world. There is the critical stuff in here, but it's well founded and well presented. I don't know who Unc Mahony is but I want to put my money with him. Great on Vegas, the ponies, and lotteries ---and gambling on the Net. I was fascinated. Nuff said. The book rocks."
5,"Extremely well researched, informative and entertaining",O'Brien has written a masterful perspective on what much of America has done and will do for the chance to profit quickly on a wager. I had no earthly idea how much the essence of this thrill has shaped our very culture. Each chapter could be a prime time mini-series in itself and O'Brien's diverse collection of heavy hitter sources would make even Barbara Walters envious.
5,Excellent Book and Makes You Think,"Mr. O'Brien has written a thought-provoking book, the thesis of which is that casinos rely on a small percentage of problem gamblers for most of their profits. I was a little surprised that he didn't interview Frank Scoblete, the top gaming author in the world and my personal favorite because I would have liked to read Scoblete's opinions on O'Brien's thesis. But that is a minor quibble. The book is definitely worth reading. I tend to agree with O'Brien. Too many people are out of control when it comes to gambling."
3,Actually two books,"Mostly an interesting, well-written, and throroughly researched book. The anthopological and historical information about gambling in the US was very informative. The vignettes about individual gamblers were thought provoking. However, often the descriptions of gambling take awkward twists into very biased and unfounded criticisms. It reads that someone combined a readable historical and cultural treatment of gambling with a distorted rant about the horrible evils of gambling. Despite the confusion, there were many parts of the book that were well done."
3,"good, but certainly not great.","This book could have really taken off on the glitz of the gambling industry, instead, the author chose to give us facts and figures. It reads more like a statistical economic report than an expose of gambling. I found it to be well written and well researched, but over-done- over-long, and over-turned. I was not pleased with this entry at all. Overall, I would say that it was average at best. I think, a little more thought and effort could have produced a fantastic narrative here."
3,A bullet for me....please !,"""A Bullet For Joey"" is really not a bad story, but the dialogue is extremely flat, boring and Edward G. Robinson and George Raft are simply going through the motions with their monotone voices. Neither actor seems like they really want to be in this movie.Some nice police procedural activity is seen with mid 1950s radar systems in use.For EGR and Raft fans only !!I am still debating on whether to purchase it or not !"
2,waste of time potboiler,"what might have been a taut thriller is hampered by a meandering plot that sluggishly makes its way to a mawkish ending (Raft's calculating hood isn't such a bad guy after all). What little style and authority the film has is due to Robinson, a dynamic actor who is wasted in this film. If you are going to buy any of the MGM film noirs, get The Stranger or Woman in the Window, both with Robinson and both superior to this turkey."
3,"Not his finest hour, but not his worst...","Not a great film, by any stretch of the imagination. Too stagey, creaky and obvious. But Robinson really delivers (the shot after he sends up the flare is absolutely stunning -- look at the resignation on that face!), and Audrey Totter does a nice job as the moll who turns out to be a soft touch. Those two performances turn a two star effort into a three star film."
5,In retrospect.......it is that good!,"And this is season TWO, not the whole series, which I grant did run out of gas but not before several excellent seasons. Season two is one of the better ones with several memorable episodes. I liked most seeing Five O'clock Charlie, which manages to tell a message about war and still be funny. Thats something that they lost as the series progressed. Its also great to see how brilliant Larry Linville was as Frank Burns. He is way underrated in that regard. Even though there arent any extras here, the shows themselves are more than worth the price. One of the best."
5,Long live Col. Flagg!,"You just can't get much better humor than with Col. Flagg and Frank Burns. Out of the thousands of great lines, 2 quickly come to mind.Colonel Flagg: My orders are to do whatever it takes to break up this penicillin ring, and I have written permission to die in the attempt!During a ""forced"" birthday party for Frank, filled with phony shows of emotion to him, Hot Lips whispers to Frank: You see Frank, they really love you.In a gentle voice, Frank Burns: It was their hatred that fooled me.The first 3 seasons: GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!"
5,Glorius in its writing and acting; a very big winner,I have all the DVD's of M*A*S*H. I had to lend them to my son who is a MASHaholic like me. I figure he needs it as he's on his way to Afghanistan.
5,Season 2 even better.,Another full season of MASH uncut no comercials and all the laughter. Twenty-four more episodes. All stand-out episodes which I just play over and over. MASH fans cannot be disapointed in the quaility and packaging Fox is putting into these releases.
2,NO PLAYALL FUNCTION,"So you must manually move to the next episode every 22 minutes.For me I like to put playall then do work or whatever, because I find these shows very relaxing and just play them all day. But if I must manually change it every 22 minutes its self defeating."
5,Great Product does what it is supposed to,I bought this to use for bluray player from the us. In switzerland this works perfect and 13$ is nothing compared to change the bluray player
2,Very heavy....,I ordered this with the idea of taking it to Europe to simplify the difference in electrical current but I found it to be very heavy and not travel friendly. I'm sure it would have worked fine but I ended up not taking it and opting for a lighter and more practical converter/adapter combination from another company.
1,Avoid this product; poor quality,"This step down converter is, in theory, designed for continuous use, provided you use it with the correct wattage appliance.I used it as a supplement for my laptop, which draws at 130 watts. (The latop battery can handle up to 220-240V power, and only requires a plug adaptor, but I wanted to use the converter as a supplement/buffer for the battery, and it came in handy as a kind of short extension cord.) This converter is designed to support up to 200 watts, and I only needed 130 -- but it quit on me 4 days into a 4 month trip. It ran hot, but did not smell burned -- it simply stopped working after about 12 cumulative hours of use. Truly a waste of money. I recommend trying a different brand."
1,It didn't work for me,"I just worked for 2 hours for me. I bought to use it with my speaker system which is 80 watt so I though I wouldnt have problem with a 200 watt converter, It was working at first but the next day I realize that it is burned. I guess I should have unpluged it for the time that I am not using the speaker."
1,"Adapter, not a converter","Used this on a recent trip to Germany. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to do any voltage conversion; my shaver was still running at monumental speeds. Basically just a big adapter."
3,Worked when others didn't but died on 10th day,"Long cord helped as it was heavy. Worked with any appliances when others didn't. Never used for more than hairdryer, ipod, camera charger or curling iron. Died on 10th day...no light no charge in an outlet that worked for others. Will take it apart to see if there's a fuse. Had it not stopped working, I would have given it the best of ratings!"
3,It works,"We used this recently and were able to charge all our devices while over seas for three months, it takes a little long to charge an ipad but it works."
5,Very Original,This is a very unique and amazing gaming system that some people weren't ready for. this is for the gamer who wants more than pushing buttons.
4,Happy Time,I bought this as a gift for my grandson and together we spend a couple of evenings of quility time! He enjoyed it so much he gave his other nintendo to his younger brother.
1,DS lite,The DS I purchased did not have a serial number on it. I dont know if it was stolen or what but I bought it in since december and when I went to trade it in at our local Game Stop recently they said they couldn't take it cause it had no serial number. This is a very serious matter.
2,A game system for kids,"The Nintendo DS is aimed for kids. Most of the third party games are really weak. You can not count on this system for 3D graphics. To date Metroid Prime Hunters is the best graphics on the DS. The only reason you should buy this is for the flagship titles (Mario Bros, Pokemon, Metroid). Overall, there is not that much for this system. It is ideal for 2d games only. Even when the developer does a good job with a 3d game, the game still looks pixelated due to the low resolution screen. The DS has no way of running media (unless it has a mod/soft mod)Which make this system alot less entertaining. Overall, if you are looking for a portable console the DS is not the thing for people 11+"
4,Neat Device,"Personally I like the Nintendo DS. Like most of the newer game systems out there one is able to play the older version games they may posess. I have the lite which is bought for Japanese video games. This is really the only thing that the DS offers that its competitors do not. Nintendo does not regonialize its products so for those of us who like the play foregin video games for lanague practice don't have to worry about voiding out the warrenty. The other nice thing that Nintendo offers for parents of younger kids is a good range of games for varring ages. Its a good buy, however beyond this some other hand held video games like PSP offers more capablities and is only one hundred and sixty-nine dollars now. Deffinitly way your options, but you can feel good at the end of the if you buy a nintendo DS you have bought a quality product."
4,My son's addicted,"My 12 yr-old opted for this over the PSP for Christmas. I was doubtful at first, but now I'm convinced that he made the right choice. Drawback - The game selections for the DS are somewhat limited. I feel that in a year, I will be buying the next best handheld game. For now, however, he is hooked."
5,Best Christmas Gift,"I have two boys ages 10 & 7 and they moved up from the Nintendo SP to this. We also bought the WII system and they love this somuch more than the WII. We travel and they go everywhere with us. The black gets kid of dirty with finger prints, but overallit is great! Nintendo puts out great products!!"
2,Cannot use this here,"We were excited to receive this but found that it would only work in the Orient. I guess these things are coded differently for certain countries. The description said nothing about this. My son's GF works in gaming and noticed this coding on the box when it arrived. This was the ""big"" gift for Christmas. It was a big let down for my daughter."
4,Black Beauty,"This is a replacement item. It arrived so quickly. My son is so exited. I wanted to wait until his birthday to give it to him, but I had to let him know that I found one which he would like which didn't have the matted texture on one side. He doesn't like the matted hinges, but he loves everything else about it. I thought two games were to come with it, but I may be confusing it with another. But he likes the color and texture. I was so impressed at how fast we received it."
2,Nintendo ds lite,Was disappointed. The on and off button broke. Was unable to play it a week after we got it. Had to buy a brand new one to replace it. Should have did that in the first place. Not happy.
2,Defective,"At a cursory glance, the DS seems fine. I used it to play Pokemon FireRed for an hour or so on the top screen and it seemed fine. However, when I went to go and change its internal clock, I noticed that the bottom screen very quickly starts having rendering problems. After just a few moments the bottom screen was completely white, and while it responded to touch, nothing was visible. Completely unusable for any game that makes use of the bottom screen, which just makes it a glorified Game Boy Advance."
4,Brain Age,Brain Age for the Nintendo DS system is challenging and keeps one mentally alert. It gives tips for everyday situations in life where one can exercise their mind muscles. It also provides challenging exercises to determine the age at which one is functioning that day and to strengthen mental skills. Very good for baby boomers to test their mental acuity.
5,The best portable games console. Ever.,"I've owned an original Nintendo GameBoy, but never really anything else until a PSP a few years ago..which I hv to say was a bit disappointing. Portable enough to fit in a handbag but too big for a pocket. And the games disks were too fragile for my liking.Enter the DS Lite. I've carried this thing everywhere with me, it's been robust, reliable and really really fun to use. Nintendo are once again at the top of the league and deservedly so. I'd reccommend the console to anyone who wanted some fun on the move. If I had to point out a few minor issues, the charger is only 120V so it won't work in Europe and apparantly I've heard that there are limitations on which regions yo can buy your games - but that's a small price to pay for such a great toy. Well done Nintendo!"
1,Poor,The game system only worked for four days and now he has like 10 games that he got for his birthday and he can't play with them because I don't have the money to buy another one? Do you guys have returns on this item. One that works? Thank You.
1,The Worst Nintendo Platformer Ever!,"What to say about this system... IT STINKS! All of these new platformers, they STINK! Personally I would rather have an Original Game Boy w/ a Golf game. Watching a boring social studies movie is better than the hottest stupidest NINTENDO DS LITE:P!!!!! However, all of the games for the Nintendo DS stink, they are all for the toddlers.What ever you do, DO NOT spend your money on this piece of Garbage, the original Game Boy is much more durable because it doesn't have hinges.DO NOT Buy me.LoveNintendo"
1,Nitendo DS Lite Onyx Black,"This product never arrived my home NEVER NEVER i dispute this item i didt resolve. American express gave me the money back , neither seller or amazon resolved this problem"
1,It's the same thing!,"I have the original DS,and I read some bad reviews about the DS lites, so I kept my DS and got a lite to compare.The lite is basically the same system with a few minor tweaks, like brighter screens and a bit smaller. So what?The original DS is actually more stable than the lite, and you can still play the same games as on the lite.I just want to say, if you have the original DS, then don't get a lite, because it's a waste of perfectly good money."
1,Not really a review,"Just a small complaint: why is Amazon selling the DS for $192.00 when regular retail stores sell it for $129.99? I was going to use a gift card to pay for some of this and pony up the rest out of my pocket, but if Amazon continues to offer rediculous prices I will buy the DS somewhere else and Amazon will lose my money.Please offer the nintendo DS lite for the same price as retail stores. I don't like being ripped off."
3,Warning all teenagers!!!,"The DS is the worst portable game system for anyone over 10 years of age to buy!!! Al of the games are for little kids ages 4-10. There arent even ten teen games that i know of. where is the fun in that! If you are buy this for someone under 13, i say your making a smart choice. But if you are over 13 and want some real teenage fun, go for the Sony Playstation Portable! Please take HUGE consideration into what i am saying. this game is just not for teens..."
4,Nintendo DS Lite / kid's games,"I purchased the DS Lite for my 11 year old daughter after she saw her 8 year old sister receive one for Christmas. She had been using a Nintendo DS for about four months previously, and just had to have the DS Lite. She uses it daily, and enjoys it immensely. We have never experienced a problem with it, and it seems to function flawlessly. I am a very satisfied customer."
1,Horrible,I was sent this ds lite with the WRONG charger and the top screen goes out WHEN YOU TRY AND PLAY!!! I SENT AN EMAIL AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THEY GOT IT SENT BACK AND I COULD ONLY GET A PARTIAL REFUND!!!!
5,FUN IS FUN,"Being the first time I buy a used DS, I was very satisfied with the delivery time. The game itself being in a used condition showing scratch corners didn't matter, because the game worked perfectly. I would definatly buy another DS like this one in the near future."
5,nintendo,loved it until it was dropped. now not working so well. Wish there were someway to repair it. My son loves the onyx black cover.
5,WoW! Nintendo DS is stellar!!!,"I was surprised on how much fun I'm having with my DS. I had the Gameboy SP which i played for a few months and didn't really think the DS was worth the spending of more money. I saw an ad for New Super Mario Bros and had to play it so i bought the DS. Im amazed at the graphics and gameplay. I enjoyed the DS experience so much, i beat New SMB in 3 days! I love the DS Lite for its size highly recommend it!!! My Creative Vision W (movie/mp3 player) will be taking a backseat for a very long time to my new DS. Love it!"
5,Rockin Awesome for ALL ages,"I just bought my DS lite the other day and love it! I only have tried two games, Brain Age and Cooking Mama. They both work great and have unique feature to the DS. The DS is a great size, has a storing spot for the stylus , and you can have a DS game and a GB or GBA cartridge in it at the same time. The pictochat thing looks cool, but i havent had a chance to use it since there is not a DS within 65 feet of me. writing with the stylus is generally good. For quick math skill games sometimes the numbers i write are read wrong.I highly recommend reading reviews on games or playing them if you have a chance before you purchase them. 1 out of 2 of the games I have I want to return, have no more desire to play. Be sure to read reviews and determine what the game is, otherwise you will be wasting money and time on games not for you. Good thing is there is a wide variety avalible for the DS with GBA games also avalible.Real happy so far - just want more games now!!"
4,nintendo ds lite,I bought the nintendo for my 3 children for christmas. They all love it. It is easy to use and has many games for all different ages. I would recommend this item to anyone with children who are younger. It is slightly ''young'' for my 14 year old. The DS has provided hours of fun for my kids....
5,New Nintendo Lite,"Excellent console, i bougt two for mi kids and they love it. The game in network using the wireless capacity make this console and excellent choice for multiple players games."
5,IT IS THE BEST EVER,"I got this for x-mas and it is the best. All my friends are jelous. The picto chat feature is amazing, what it is is that you can chat with pepole and you can draw on it to. Another thing I like about this DS is that there are alot of acesseries that you can buy. Also there are alot of games to play. For anyone who loves dogs I would suggest nintendogs game. But this review is about the ds not that game. If you also go on planes this is a good portable device to have fun on. Some game stuff that I like is that I used to have a GameBoy and I have alot of games for it so I want to play those to and the DS has a place so you can play GameBoy games and DS games to. But 1 thing I would suggest, is that if you are okay with having fun this is the product for you!!!!"
3,Not for anyone older that 13,I have both psp and ds the ds is strictly for kids most of games are really kiddish and get very boring after a while not only that but it breaks very easy at first i really liked my ds about after a month i was kinda sick of it and gave it to my little brother thats when i bought my psp which gave me more to do than just play games i could play movies listen to music even use the internet now if your buying this for a kid (3-10years old) its great but if your buying for someone older get them a psp or ipod
5,Excellent!,"Great in every point of view. The tactil screen is a revolutionary idea. The pencil is a little small for some games, but is good enough."
5,nintendo ds lite,"This review is about nintendo ds lite. Ds stands for double screen. It has a touch screen and a regular screen. There are a lot of games for the Nintendo ds, such as new super Mario bros, super Mario 64, and Mario hoops 3 on 3, and that is just the beginning. There are also two slots in it so any ds game can go in and any sp game can go in, so you can play them. I have a ds with ten other games, and my friends have a ds, too and they all think it is fun."
5,Love it!,"I love the portability of the Ninentendo DS Lite. Lunch breaks, sitting in a doctor's office or wherever it's great to have some way to pass the time and not have to carry around a heavy book. These units are even smaller than a paperback.Lots of games are available for both genders, for kids and for adults. There is almost no learning curve on the Nintendo DS, they are very easy to use. And you can get about five hours of use on a decently bright setting before they need to be recharged."
5,Brain Age,I bought this game to help my memory as I get older. I really enjoy it and look forward to doing it over and over. Well worth it.
4,great product in a little case,I am an older adult found the product works well the games including the Brain Age are great.
3,Its ok,I like it to a point. the lite compared to the original is liter but the fact is that it is thiner and the thing is that after I owned it for 6 months one of the hinges broke. Nintendo is making nothing but cheap systems anymore. The lite ds does have 1 advantage and that is the fact that you can buy the browser for it. But if Nintendo was smart they would have made the browser compatible with the original ds for the reason that the original (in my eyes) is made a whole lot better.
4,lighter slicker and a lot better,Two years ago I got a nintendo ds for my birthday. At first I had my doubts but when I unboxed it I knew it would last and it has. Very nice quality and it very tough yet stylish they could have made its width a little thinner. Anyways right when I put a game in It responded right wawy no hesitation. I kinda did get addicted to it for some reason pictochat was also very very fun to play with . Overall it the nintendo ds lite is a stylish tough amazing handheld to play with. My ds has never frozen or gave any problems thanks nintendo.
5,excelente,"excelente producto, muy buena calidad, y profesional en la atencion,me encanto el producto, recomiento este producto ampliamente, satisfaccion total. recomiendo esta tienda completamente"
3,Too fragile for an expensive item,"I purchased two GameBoy DS for my twin's 9th BDay. Here is it a month later and already it's broken. A small item was tossed at their brother and it hit/damaged the upper screen on the GameBoy DS. It appears that there is no damage to actual glass, however when you turn it on, it shows a digital ""crack"" and you can no longer view the upper screen. It was a fun game while it lasted, but now we have a very unhappy boy that's sad he broke his favorite toy. Per Nintendo's website, ""warranty does not cover physical damage (such as the system being dropped or hit)."" So we're trying to see how much it will cost to have it repaired (if it can even be repaired). Buyers beware that this is a fragile item, maybe not meant for young children?"
3,Great System but Where can I find it though?,First off I want to say is that this is really cool and everything but the wierd thing about is that you can't find it on Amazon? I mean I want to ask anyone from any reviewer of any of the Nintendo DS Lites is that Where can I find it because Amazon is sold out? Can there be any place to find this at? Anyway if anyone knows you can submit a review!
3,Nintendo DS Lite: Great system . . . terrible games,"Nintendo DS is a great system.The graphics are a huge improvement over Gameboy Advance, and the touch screen is cool.And not much else...I've played seven games for it so far, one of which is exellent (The Sims 2), one of which is fairly decent (Nintendogs), and five of which are terrible (Sonic Rush, Need for Speed Underground 2, Spongebob Yellow Avenger, Pac-Pix, and StarFox Command).I don't like how game saves aren't stored in the system or on a memory card.Through a chain of events you probably don't care about, I ended up with a different copy of The Sims 2 than I started with, so I have to start from the begining (and seeing how far I progressed in the earlier copy, it dosen't seem likely I will).Nintendo DS Lite is a great system.If only the same could be said for its games..."
4,Think before buying black.,"This system works great, we have yet to come across any problems. And it looks much better than the older DS. The screen is better lit and the style is a lot less bulky. We will definately be getting another one for our other son for his birthday in May. The only thing I regret is buying the black one because it shows fingerprints and smudges from touching it extremely well. I'm not sure about the white one (or other colors if there are any) but as for black it always looks dirty. I will be finding a skin for it asap!"
2,borrow it- not much in it worth buying,"The ""families"" (""composites"" she admits in the introduction) were way too fictionalized to be relatable. And the tone of each story was way too high up on the positives of home schooling while minimizing the negatives (if any- a messy house? being busy? that was about it) All these ""families"" were saved by homeschooling and now they love each other, are responsible, get along great, the kids love it, they're learning so much, etc. It also felt like I was reading Lisa's story over & over again because pieces of it kept getting woven into each story she created. It's worth two stars because it tells you the different styles of homeschooling. The few resources listed in the back could easily be found in other books worth owning (Top 100 Picks by Cathy Duffy- that one's great). I skimmed through this in a couple hours one night (couldn't stand the cheezy chapter openings- it's all way too contrived) & now it gets to go back to the library."
3,Where's Lisa?,"I liked Lisa Whelchel's book The Facts of Life and Other Lessons My Father Taught Me because she told her own story in a way that made me think I knew her personally. Only part of this book is about her experiences with homeschooling--the rest is about ""friends"" who don't really exist. Lisa says that's because she's trying to speak to your heart instead of your head. Well, okay, but I identify more with real people. Besides the made-up stories, her writing style isn't as engaging and her sense of humor doesn't come through. Perhaps they were both edited out of this book. Too bad. It would have helped make it something besides just another book about homeschooling."
4,Thinking about homeschooling,"This book is definitely an easy and fairly enjoyable read. I do agree with one of reviewers about the book seeming to be written by Ned Flanders. Surprisingly I did get through it in two days, reading only when my son napped. What I wanted to add is that there is a great appendix of books and on-line resources at the end of this book. As I read the stories about how each family homeschools, I would think to myself, ""Hey, that sounds cool. I wonder where I can find more info about that."" At the back of the book, apparently!"
5,"must read, awesome book!","Super easy read, I just started a couple of hours ago and I'm halfway through. The stories from the families are awesome, and there is even a chapter from the point of view of a teenager that was home school and finished high school at 14.It covers views from all sorts of people, normal parents (yes even a dad!) From all walks of life. Messy housed parents like myself that just want to do whatever to make the best choices for our kids.Traditional, Christian, and unschooling parents.LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!"
5,Good book,"I am considering homeschooling, and this book was very convincing. It's an easy, quick read with delightful stories. Yet, the stories are so different. Good purchase!"
3,A Good Read Until the Last Chapter,"This book was uplifting and encouraging until the last chapter. When Lisa has us visit her in TX and talks about her children in their new school. If I wasn't already homeschooling I think that I would seriously reconsider. If a homeschool mom feels relief at not having to do all of the work, why would anyone want to try in the first place? I was also disappointed that the 15 families weren't real and just made up composites. I would love to find a book that actually has real families."
2,Made up stories of 15 COMPOSITE homeschooling families,"The book description says this is a look at ""fifteen real families"" -- um, no, it's a collection of fifteen composites of homeschooling families that Whelchel has created. Individual details here and there may come from real homeschoolers, but no one portrait is of a real family. They are made up. If you want to read stories from actual homeschoolers, check out ""Homeschool Open House"" by Nancy Lande or ""Real Lives"" by Grace Llewellyn.I give this book two stars instead of one because it's an interesting overview of types of homeschooling, but in no way is it a REAL look at homeschooling."
2,"Poor quality, good customer support","Battery started losing its capacity after few charges.After only 5-8 cycles, the battery was not charging more than 70-80% of its max capacity.I contacted Oncore support and they said the one I got was defective, so they replaced it at no charge (their customer support was very fast and nice).I got a new one but I haven't used enough to see if is going to have the same problem (but from the few tests performed, it doesn't seem much better)."
1,WARNING to mac G5 owners! incompatiblity!,"warning! trying to use this as a pci card will NOT work with a G5, even though this is listed as mac compatible. It is the WRONG type of PCI card, and further, the G5 will not allow you to add a 5.25 front...so you're stuck if you have a G5.I found out the hard way, and going through amazon's return process means I have to pay postage since they say its not their fault, EVEN THOUGH their listing here is misleading to G5 owners, hence my low review, and the reason for posting this WARNING!DO NOT BUY if you own a G5, not only will it not work, amazon will soak you for return postage."
5,A FABULOUS UNIQUE MACADAMIA NUT COOKBOOK,THIS RECIPE BOOK IS LOADED WITH FANTASTIC RECIPES...EACH ONE BETTER THAN THE NEXT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. My Macadamia Nut Recipes from Our Plantation House
4,Mastering slightly dumbs down the tone a little,"Overall a great CD with most of Jelly's early piano solos before he formed a band, however the songs do sound a little muddy since the mastering tried too hard to get rid of the hiss and in turn made the piano sound a little dull on some of the songs. The music is essential, but unfortunately, the mastering takes away from some of it. I would recommend the 1923-1924 over this, but if the hiss really bothers you that much, go for this one."
4,One of the greatest adventure\ action games,"The sound\grapics and the big seenary whit a skin crawling music\sound, makes this game very entertainment to play."
4,My God,"Well, I got the game and I was able to play untill one day the game ran scratchy and I had to uninstall it, but wouldn't load back up. The stupid file called ""QueenEnd.unr""(I know alot about computers),always said ""The source media may be bad"" So I'm looking foward to reordering the game, in the meantime, I'll wait for my Unreal Action Figures to come in the mail."
2,"It ain't no ""Unreal Tournament""--it is an ""almost""","The main difficulty I have with Unreal Gold is certainly not the low price, but the low graphics. See, I have to run it in Software Mode. Sure I ""only"" have a two year old Pentium II DELL R350, with 128 SDRAM and an S3 Graphics card with 32 meg, but this game should have a patch for this game to run in something other than software mode. My suggestion: Stick with Unreal Tournament--an awesome single or multiplayer game and avoid this Unreal Gold--which ain't real gold, only fool's gold."
2,don't bother with this game,"The game is old and pales in comparison with games out right now. Unless you're into classics, don't buy this game."
4,An Interesting History of the Great White Hunters,I found this book to be a fun read. Lots of details about the African White Hunters of the past and some exciting stories of things that happended during their hunts and careers. Some parts that recounted some hunting events with clients were pretty comical! Laid out in a chronologocal manner. Some sections seemed too long. I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about the characters and some insight on how they went about their hunting business in Africa.
5,Magnificent In Every Way ! ! !,"This book is a truly magnificent bit of history. The dangers of Africa from the viewpoint of people who were there... back in the days before emergency rescue services existed.This is a must read for any Africa buff or history buff.This book is one of those that inspired me to write the book, rexGun by Stephen TemplarRexgun."
2,Diamonds are not like picture,The diamonds are not the same quality as the photo.They are more cloudy in the main stone the ones on the bands are a little clearer. I saw the same set at Kmart.I am disappointed in the clarity.
3,Delivery was on time!,"The book was in an alright condition. It had more highlighting than I had expected, but I am glad that the book was cheaper than what my school was going to charge me if I had bought it on campus. Like the title said, it was delivered on time, which I was happy about since I was leaving a few days after the expected arrival date."
3,Common sense written down.,"This book was informative, but it really didn't go into much detail. I was looking for specifics. I didn't learn any thing I couldn't find out on the internet or with common sense."
3,"Good music, engineering could be better","I bought the disk after hearing about the colaboration on NPR. The songs and performances are impecable, the variety is satisfying and fun. My only complaint is that the quality of the recording leaves something to be desired. Several times the recording level is not balanced between the instruments so that when listening to YoYo Ma playing, when joined by the saxaphone, it comes in too loud and ruins the mood.I almost always prefer the live perfomances when the energy of the audience carries over to the performers. This is one case when I wish I had gotten the studio version."
2,"Really, bait and switch?","I love Yoyo Ma, and have grown in my love for his work with Tango music, and was super excited to get this product for my birthday, and finally once the kids were in bed, I pulled it out of the CD player, went to the TV, and learned that I could also listen to it on the TV, butTHERE WAS NO DVD OR DVD MATERIAL. Nice job Sony, sending out to your fans and customers a CD disguised as a DVD. The music is the only way this product didn't get only one star. But, I'm not rating Yoyo Ma or the works of Piazzolla, just the sad trick."
3,Quite average,"It's not a bad quality CD but the music is variable and different. Even though I like most types of music, I think the composition is just average."
4,Hardy Boys in WIPE OUT,"I was one of those girls who just LOVED Shaun Cassidy, I even had a Hardy Boys t-shirt in grade 3. Now after years of waiting to see these shows again, I was suprised that besides having cute guys, the show did have a good story line. And yes Shaun does sing, although I thought he sounded better when I was 7. Anyway this is a good one, It will bring back some of those childhood warm fuzzy feelings."
3,This Tape Has Good Episodes But Getting The Complete First Season DVD is Better!,I watched This show when I was a young girl when it was first on TV and I had a crush on Shaun Cassidy. This tape has good episodes but now that this show is on DVD it is better to get that instead. The first season Of The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mystery Show is now on DVD!
2,Exploiting the uncritical mind,"I had a really hard time getting through this book because of all of the logical fallacies. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it does the job that is was intended to do: evoke an emotional response. It makes me sad to think that this is considered ""evidence"" for a supernatural creator. One of my students recommended this book and I am going to recommend some better books to him. Read peer reviewed science publications."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read!,"This man has no concept of science or any basic understanding of its purpose. Science and religion are in two different realms. You cannot compare them or use one to prove the other is wrong.His writing resembles a dialog from an infomercial. It is childish and written for the uneducated.His basic ""reasoning"" is based on ""science can't disprove god, therefore god exists"". He equates ""intelligent design"" to his god. He doesn't explore other possibilities behind the existence of intelligence whatsoever.For those of you that gave this book 5 stars, I'd like to see a good explanation behind his reasoning, including explanation why there's only one god.Lee Strobel would have made a better argument stating repeatedly that his god exists because he feels it in his heart.If you have any common sense and basic reasoning skills, read this to feel smarter and superior to the author and the recommenders of this book."
1,Misrepresentation is par for the course,"Strobel presents an array of common misconceptions in order to make his argument. He relies on the thoughts and opinions from like-minded individuals rather than do the footwork himself. That is, Strobel offers nothing in the way of scientific evidence to support his beliefs. The author is, in short, preaching to the choir."
1,More Creationist Propaganda,"Strobel starts off his book well enough, pretending to be a neutral observer only to descend into a laughably one-sided assessment of modern cosmology. Nearly every authority he cites is an evangelical christian.There are no new arguments here that can't be debunked by a quick internet search.Sadly though, this is probably the best that the intelligent design advocates have to offer.If you are a curious person I would say read this just for some perspective and then read ""The Selfish Gene"" or ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" for a scientific account of the natural world. When you do that, get back to me and tell which is more convincing. (God won't get mad at you)"
1,A case for logical fallacies,"If you want to see how virtually every logical fallacy can be used in a single book then this is for you!If you want actual evidence or logical reasons for a belief in a god keep looking this isn't it. It's just a lot of bad data combined with faulty reasoning.In fact I'll summarize the whole book for you right here.""Wow the world is so amazing, I don't know how it happened... therefore god is real."""
1,Relies on long since dismssed scientific theories,"to try to attack evolution. At one point he picks on the fact that Ernst Haeckel used to put forth embryological drawings that were later shown to be faulty. Ok. Haeckel was out and out wrong somewhat. But the author never states that Haeckel's theory of origins concerning embryos was roughly correct. Nowadays, due to all type of ultrasound machines, we can easily show live embryos of humans, apes, other mammals, fish, and reptiles. We see the similarity of all these life forms as embryos and that supports evolutionary theories. Blab all you want, creationists, about Haeckel being wrong on a few specific points of his theory. Over all the theory of embryology is correct."
5,Creation vs Darwinism,"Lee Strobel interviews science experts in Cosmology, Biology, Micro Biology, DNA & Genetics as well as other experts and he provides a detailed explanation of why the scientific evidence supports there being a Creator of the universe and everything in it. Lee digs deep into the scientific evidence and reaches the conclusion that science does indeed prove there is a Creator. A great book for believers and skeptics alike who are confused by the media rhetoric on this subject and who has serious questions about creation versus Darwinism. This book will open your eyes to the manipulated propaganda that circulates about creationism as well as Darwinism and it just may help change your mind from being a skeptic to a believer in the Creator of the universe."
5,The Case for a Creator,"Very informative, honest review. Any one seeking for the truth tis is a must read."
2,Pared down version,"Stroebel makes some really good points in this book and changed some of my thinking about evolution, and it was a quick read, so I wasn't dissatisfied with it until I saw the non-student version at a book store. Maybe I should have done some more research on the differences between editions, but I really think anyone high school age or above could handle the 300-some pages of the ""adult"" version, which must contain a lot more information. So I'd recommend this particular version only to younger students or to someone who really just wants a small taste of the evidence."
2,,"Interesting questions raised; but ultimately unsatisfying. The final conclusion is: ""well, it doesn't make sense, so it musta been God!!!"""
2,For believers only,I saw this book at the library so I checked it out. I think it's good for people to read a book like this because it shows how strong/weak the case for a creator is. There really isn't any evidence. There are faults with aspects of evolutionary theory but nothing to support the idea of 'intelligent design'. A reader has to have a pretty strong desire to believe to take these faulty arguments seriously. How can you reconcile such poor reasoning ability with 'intelligent design'?
1,no,"As noted elsewhere, hyperbolic language is a not a mark of intellectual honesty. ""Convincing evidence"" is presented many times, and, once, ""convincing historical evidence"". The accomplishments, citations, and titles of interviewees are listed exhaustively. Over-the-top descriptions are seeded throughout the book.Strobel does bring to light complex theories and offers some of their history, though slanted to Intelligent Design. No book featuring science can be all bad.A created universe provides moral structure, according to Strobel. The idea of random evolution does not. Whatever."
1,Sheer drivel,"Being a biologist I read the chapters that pertained to biology (since that's what I'm most comfortable with) over a one hour span. By the end of those 60 minutes I wanted to shoot myself in the face.Essentially, all biology is dealt with in interviews with Mr. Wells and Behe (I refuse to call them ""Dr."") and are just lame rehashings of the their dreadful books. Yet, Strobel takes everything they say as the truth and only half attempts to question their opinions. I wouldn't hold it against Strobel if he had actually talked to a real biologist (one who doesn't have a disclaimer on his department's website or has published anything even remotely scientific in recent history), but he attempted no such thing.I realize this book is a few years out of date, but the information contained in it is simply so flat out false in the small amount I was qualified to judge that I could not sit idly by and not comment on this literary and scientific atrocity."
1,Rehashed for the 21st Century,"Lee Strobel provides no new infomation to support his view that the universe MUST have been created. Christians have been saying that Evolution is wrong every decade ever since 1859. They always claim that new evidence is out there. IT seems that only ""evidence"" they have are unwarranted attacks on evolution and other parts of science that conflict with their personal belief system. It is a curious fact that all the scientists Strobel consults are Christians and share his personal belief in God. The author doesn't really seem to be interested in the objectivity and fairness to both sides, although he constantly makes this claim. If you want your narrow-views of the universe to be comforted, this may be the perfect book for you. If you are interested in science, look elsewhere."
2,How about both sides?,Why is it that Strobel never interviews people who could articulate a well reasoned position which is contrary to the one he is trying to arrive at?
1,A CASE FOR DECEPTION,"The one thing that I noticed early in Mr. Strobel's book was his less than honest statements about being unbias. He even goes to extremes as to say he is going to play ""the skeptic"". After this the first thing he does is surround himself with friends with the same or simular theological views. Then there's the disturbing fact that he doesn't interview one scientist with an opposing view. When dealing with the evidence that the earth is over 4 billion years old, he forgets his role as skeptic and simply says that the ""when"" is not as important as the ""how"". All this alone is enough to show what a farce Strobels's book really is. This book also reminds me of I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAIT TO BE AN ATHEIST by Norman Geisler. Both play on the general public's ignorance of science to peddle their pseudo pyscho babble."
4,Good for discussion with your kids,"I do find it interesting in reading over the reviews that a book could get nothing but 4's and 5's and 1's depending on what the reviewer believes.I agree, it would have been nice to have the other side represented, but the naturalists have had their say in every school text book. I would like to have the scientific community respond to the actual claims in the book, but the book would have been too long and would have missed the intended audience - the general public.I would recommend this book to anyone, who is struggling with the evolutionists ""facts"" being taught to our children in school and open up discussions and further investigation. As more holes are found in Darwinism, hopefully we can get back to teaching science to our kids, not Darwin's anti-god version."
4,The Case for a Creator,"A very good book. At this point I am still reading it. At times it is more technical than I would like. I don't have a background in deep science, but it is an interesting book and makes a good point for a Creator."
1,Apparently god is the default answer,"Lee is a very good writer and has a pretty good grasp of science but no understanding of the scientific method. He would go into extreme detail about a large number of scientific fields, look for gaps in our current understanding and then claim that it was proof of GOD.If something is not understood, the correct answer is ""we do not know yet"" and not some magic man in the sky.Don't waste your time on this book.Don"
3,Too Naive...,"To be honest, Lee seems to be an easy guy to convince. I have a ""burning desire"" to find out a Creator of this Universe, and maybe there is one, but for sure this book didn't convince me at all. It is trying to discredit Darwin's Evolution all the time, without a single REAL fact. OK, maybe Behe's (one of the interviews) arguments are very clever, and maybe real, but all the other guys ... come on :)In fact, maybe Evolution is wrong, but that doesn't prove that God exists. It proves that Science is a thing of trial and error. So if Evolution is really wrong, scientists will find another explanation. I don't think that science has to admit the existance of God. Why ? The job of the science if to find the Truth and science won't stop because a few writers say ""God is out there, Evolution is wrong"".So at the end of the book, you will find that we are a ""privileged planet"" and ""science is wrong"". What about God, Lee ?Thanks,Magic."
1,Strobel's 'investigative' evangelising,"Strobel has done it again - yet another book presented under the guise of 'fair and balanced investigative journalism' that is actually nothing more than another opportunity for Strobel to lob soft balls at his favourite fundamentalist preachers so that they can make his case for him. Strobel's stated intent is a lie. He has not set out to present a true treatment of the issues but to evangelise, pure and simple.Lee Strobel has no understanding of the scientific method, or even the many branches of science he chooses to take issue with. How any 'serious researcher' could take someone like Jonathan Wells seriously is beyond me. The supposed science in this book is, in fact, almost as appallingly childish as the theology.This book would be of use to someone wishing to create an amusing course in critical thinking - anyone hoping to become more informed about science and theology should skip it."
5,"Clever, and well written","Recently, I've started to see the evidence of design in my research at a major state University (I'm working on a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with a background in Quantum Mechanics). I found it interesting that Strobel tied in general science and astrophysics into the ID argument.Very well written and an excellent read."
1,Deceptive Arguments,"This book is full of deceptive arguments. On chapter 3, which denounces evolution, the only ""proof"" is that the people who had proof for evolution lied. How convining. One chapter describes how the big bang must have happened. The Strobel exclaims ""if the big bang happened, there must be god!"". This book is very biased. It has shallow conclusions, unconvincing proof, and automatically thinks that just because a nobel prize winner believes in god, there must be a god. In addition, Strobel automatically implies that Christianity is the right religion. He doesn't mention other major god believing religions like Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sihkism, Shintoism, and dozens of others. Many other people go further into the flaws of this book. I suggest that you look at all the 1 star reviews first to get an idea of how misleading this book is."
5,Highly recommend!,"This is the book that prompted me to take another look at God and religion. It covers a wide variety of subjects, each with a different look at how seemingly unrelated facts (the strength of gravity, the arrangement of the planets, why ice floats) all point to a conclusion - that there is intelligent design. A very cool book no matter your religious view."
5,Great book for questioning minds,"I just finished this book a few days ago, and it was very well done. Too often those who protest religion do so using straw man arguments; they take the ""symbols"" of the faith and attack those, yet they never touch the underlying reasonable theology. Stroebel does a great job of laying out a fairly dense and systematic argument and I'd highly recommend this book to any serious inquisitors of the Christian faith."
4,Interesting read,"I really liked the information and how it was presented. Strobel definitely makes you think about religion being a blend of fact and faith. I wish that the writer only would have used more opinions of people who were against it; I felt that his work was biased toward the side of a Creator. Also, need some women interviews! But, definitely a good read."
5,Tired of being knocked around,Even before I was saved by our Creator I didn't believe in evolution. I thought the case for evolution was weak at best but I couldn't find good arguments against. I became tired of being knocked around by Darwinist who blindly believed what the science community put out. The Case for a Creator by Lee Strobel gives creationism respectable feet to stand on. I found the presentation to be intelligent and scientifically reasonable but not above what the average high school student can understand.
2,The Bible and Science,"1. The Bible is not meant to be scientific. (No doubt one can have a point of view and play with numbers to get everything to line up, but seriously)2. Science is not meant to be biblical. (Although it sure does require a lot of faith)That being said, I have to ask myself over and over again - Do these authors even read the Bible?I've now finished this book and actually feel guilty for not just turning to my Bible for answers.In my opinion, The Case for Christ is a far better book. That book dealt with more realistic ""evidence"" or ""facts"" than The Case for a Creator (which is filled with theory's and idea's).This book can be an interesting read, but one shouldn't take it seriously. For me, it has been a terrible distraction from my faith.P.S. For those that take Lee Strobel's ""skeptic"" approach seriously, I think you missed the point. I took it as a theme or style for writing, not as his literal approach."
5,Amazing,"The creator can not create anything that is bigger or more awesome than He is.How great and awesome He is.This book give you insight at His beauty and wisdom.Not an easy book to read but neither is digging for diamonds,Wel worth the effort"
2,Letdown,"I really enjoyed Strobel's other books--The Case for Christ and The Case for Faith, but this book was way too esoteric for me. Difficult to follow and difficult to finish."
3,Scripture Conflicts Weaken Strobel's Case,"After reading The Case for Christ and The Case for Faith, I found Lee Strobel to be a compelling author and a very good ""attorney"" for God and the Bible. However, when reading The Case for a Creator, I noticed that Strobel succumbed to popular misinformation when he agreed with the theory that the universe is 14 billion years old. He gives more credit to science than the Bible in that respect, ignoring the account of Creation. To be fair, Strobel does build a strong case against evolution, which may be worth reading. As with any religious literature, keep in mind your own beliefs and read with caution."
2,Pretty dang boring,"Although i leanred new facts that i had never knew about the salem trials, i found my self nodding to sleep several times and reading the same points over and over."
1,horrible,Book was way to over priced for its condition.. Usually used books may be highlighted or written in but there were lines through the words you couldnt read some parts.. very unhappy.
3,OK product if they'd gotten my shipping label correct!,"After finding bedbugs in my apartment, I immediately ordered one of these mattress protectors and paid the extra $29.50 for express shipping. Well, to make a long story short, the company COMPLETELY messed up my mailing address and my order arrived MANY days late. And not until after I emailed them to find out where my package was did I receive my package which was then overnight shipped to me. They did refund my shipping expense, but not until I contacted them 2Xs by email and once by phone."
4,"the first half is bland, but the second half shines","When putting in this cd, i recall seeing the band live at the canyon club, with Factory 81, Downset, etc. I thought they were great, and really stood for themselves on the stage. When they told us that their cd was coming out on March 20, I was sure to run and buy it. When listening to it, I realized how simplistic the music really was, and that most of it has been done before. The first six songs on the cd are pretty lame, and repetitive. But, when my favorite song on the cd, ""Nothing"" started up, the cd quickly redeemed itself. From then on, nothing but good songs came out of, ""Healing."" The singer sounds like Scooter from Cold, Aaron from Staind, and Gavin Rossdale from Bush at the same time. The band, on the other hand, is rather straight-forward, like most nu-metal bands. Listen before you buy, and chances are you'll enjoy it for awhile"
4,Their best,"Good CD. Probably their best. Becoming i is way too soft. If you wanna get into Unloco, this is the one to get."
5,good stuff,"well i havent even gotten this cd but ive heard all of it and i must say that as soon as i can gather 12 bucks togther im gonna run to the nearest store, find the cd on the rack, grab it with my hands, smell the nice plastic wrapping then quickly run to the checkout, throw money at the lady and quickly find the closest cd player and listen to the musical goodness....or something like that-anyways these guys are really good(lots of potential)right now i have ""face down"" stuck in my head and thats not a bad thing.so uh....buy this and make them rich and famous so they can make more music!!"
4,a sophomore effort,"I liked Unloco when I first heard about them from a coworker. I listened to their first CD, Useless, and enjoyed it. For the most part, I enjoy Healing as well. I liked some of the recordings of the songs on Useless better than Healing (particularly the song ""Useless""). Some of the music could stand to be more complex and the vocals could definitely use a bit of work. (It sounds like they applied distortion to every word that they possibly could, and I like being able to understand lyrics.) Oh well, I still like the CD and it was definitely worth the money I paid for it. With a little bit more work, Unloco could be great."
1,Horrible,"Boring, if there is one word to describe this CD, it's boring. Sure, maybe the CD picks up after about 7 tracks, but these guys lack originality. Don't buy this CD, it's a waste of time and money."
1,Stay away from seagate or maxtor,"Seagate had a good reputation before, but now I would rather stay away from seagate or maxtor. In the last two years, five hard drivers have failed (including this one), all of them are seagate or maxtor."
1,Product Failed - No Replacement Drives Available,"I purchased and installed this drive. It failed shortly afterwards. It made a whining noise and finally the OS failed to recognize it.I obtained an RMA and returned the drive to Maxtor. Nearly 3 weeks later, and they will not ship another drive because they have no replacement drives available.The drive ran great during the short period before it failed, but I cannot recommend it due to poor reliability and no product support."
2,>_<,"This dance pad works great, but I'm disappointed for a few reasons.First of all, it gives off an annoying scrunchy noise when you step on it, which makes it difficult to concentrate on the music... And of course, the entire pad slides a lot, as well as it's ""wrapping"", no matter if you play on hardwood or carpet.Try to find a metal dance pad instead of this cheap garbage bag. They're expensive, but better."
3,UP button problems,"I bought this product and it seems to work perfectly; it dosent seem to slide and it responds with the the touch of your toe, all except the UP button, which I found the sensor for when setting it up, (I use it on PC with a converter), but could not get it to respond as much as I stomped on it when playing the game. It cannot be fault of the converter because all of the other buttons worked with no flaws. I hope it is just a glitch with my particular pad, but I wouldn't chance it."
4,everythings great so far,it shipped sooo fast. got it 2 business days after ordering. the only thing is it does slide a little... but if you go to any carpet store. you can get this rubber anti glide stuff you put under carpets to keep them from sliding. i put a couple stips under the dance pad and it like dosnt slide at all. the stuff grips to carpet hard wood anything really.
4,It was a fun read,"I don't like to give 5 stars unless it's a classic or superb, but this one was fun to read. I enjoyed it. Go ahead."
4,Great waterproof tape,"This tape holds up very well and is waterproof unlike many other water resistant tapes. It holds up to abrasion and sheer quite well. The only downfall is the short amount of tape on each roll, 15 feet may seem like a lot, but when taping up bandages it does not last very long. All in all a very good product."
1,Not worth it,"I am writing this just over a year since I bought it.I bought this for my wife. I have a number of ""real"" laptop bags but they were too big and ugly as far as my wife was concerned. We looked around and she liked the look of this.The plus is it was cheap but sadly you get what you pay for.First thing I noticed is very little protection. I was looking for something to protect her laptop, she was looking for something to carry the laptop in so we had different requirements. I was going to send it back but she said she would try it.She doesnt travel a huge amount. Maybe she used this 20 times but I doubt it. Within that time both of the handles pulled out.Pass on this. Spend the money on a better real case that is designed to protect the laptop. You will be betetr off in the long run."
4,Great Book fantastic read,"I read this book in a flight across Australia, fuelled with ideas, and practical semantic stuff. Michael Hall does have his own terms and language, and does repeat himself a few times, even word for word in some paragraphs. But, brushing that aside, it is a new way of thinking, and conditioning your mind."
5,A pleasant surprise - no self hype here!,"A very good read. I'm not quite down with it, but a great book. There's no self-hype here by Couch. The authors do a great job taking a story of ""small town boy makes good"" into a story all of us can relate to in one way or another. I've been a Tim Couch fan ever since he came to Cleveland, and you'll enjoy reading about how he gets there. A definite must-read."
4,A little surprised,"First off I would like to say that I love the shoe! However, I was quite surprised when I opened the box and the shoe is not white it is a light blue with flowers embedded in the leather. Still cute but the picture is misleading. If you don't like flowers, don't buy these shoes and if you are looking for white shoes, don't buy these either."
3,once again; know yourself as a listener,"The chops here are in the top echelon,(I still rank Holdsworth above this and all else). Young guitarists who are into shredding might want to get this and a transcription machine to learn the concepts. As music , however it is not on the same level. I have a theory: 1/In earlier times, a hot-shot player still needed to fit into other types of groups in order to make a living, as so would learn how to play 'real' songs, along with singers, getting only short fills here and there, learning to make the most of each musical opportunity, and, in the end, improving their playing. 2/ Now, speed demons have their own market to just play as long and as fast as they can without looking back. This has caused a sameness throughout the genre...The greatest players make great long riffs out of great short ones. It's time for Derryl to concentrate on the short ones."
5,The next step in guitar,"Derryl's 1st Cd is a mind blower. Never before have I heard a guy play his guitar in such a way...his playing goes beyond human ability. And he's not just a mongolian string bender...this guy KNOWS his stuff and can write good songs too. I think Derryl has a bright future ahead of him in the world of guitar and fusion music. I can't wait to hear what this guy does next...Even the greats like Greg Howe, Brett Garsed and Shawn Lane are AMAZED at this man's ability to play guitar."
4,FINALLY! A widescreen presentation!,"Echo Bridge Home Entertainment's re-release of Pokemon: Destiny Deoxys might not have any extras or even a 5.1 mix, but it does have one thing the previous release did NOT have: a widescreen presentation of the film. Two Thumbs Up for that aspect of the release (pun intended)."
3,lie,"The description said it was new but it was found to be used, I found the disl scratched, the case broken, and the cover run down. The illustration was a complete lie. I am highly disappointed."
5,Pokemon Destiny Deoxys,After watching this movie I am now addicted to it awesome.This movie arrived at my door in perfect condition.I would recomend this movie to anyone who likes pokemon and I would be more than happy to buy from this seller again in the future
1,Not Even Close to the Real JOHN BERRY!,"I waited eagerly for this new album from the most incredible voice alive, John Berry. What a disappointment! All the songs are bland, the music has no heart and John sounds like he's holding back. Other than hitting a high note here and there, his voice seems to lack power. Listen to ""Live My Dreams"" on his SADDLE THE WIND cd and you'll know what I mean. Don't waste your bucks or ears on this one. Get FACES and every album prior to it to get a taste of the REAL John. Don't forget his two fabulous Christmas albums, O HOLY NIGHT and MY HEART IS BETHLEHEM. He's not holding back at all on those recordings.Once you hear his version of O Holy Night, no other version will ever do. I'll just wait for his next album and hope for the perfection which has completely eluded him on this latest attempt."
1,very disappointing,What has happened to John Berry? All of the songs on this album sound bland and generic. No spirit at all. No soaring vocals. Even the music is boring. He hasn't had a quality album since FACES. Save your money folks; buy FACES and every album before that if you want a true taste of his fabulous voice and deep character. This album is a dud.
5,All The Way To Here,"Lovely album. Great feel good tunes. Any John Berry fan will tell you, John has developed into a gentle soundsmith, not unlike James Taylor. As we listen to his songs, we not only enjoy the music, we enjoy our day. ""How Much Do You Love Me?"" is a wonderful valentine for any parent to send to their child. Other special songs are ""Everybody Knows"" and ""Sanctuary"". Pop this cd into your player and it will sing you sweetly through your day."
3,Save your money,Save your money An Age of New Possibilities: How Humane Values and an Entrepreneurial Spirit Will Lead Us into the Future is one of those books where the title says it all. I skimmed the book as it really didn't seem to have anything really new under the sun for me.
2,wrong book,ordered 2004 book. the picture on this book is not the right picture. i received 2000 in the mail and the picture on the front ofthis book is a star cake. wrong book wrong picture on the book adversited. very dissapointed company wanted me to pay postage back and a restocking fee. would have cost me more than i paid to get the right book.
5,Southern Living Collection,I gave my collection of Southern Living Annual Recipes to my niece and was missing the 2002 Annual. I was pleased to find it so reasonably priced. It arrived in great condition.
4,IPOD Companion,"This item overall is a good buy. It was listed as black but came in white. This would be ok if the product was not being used in a mechanic shop. Everything functions correctly except the power on/off alarm. I was able to set it but it won't power on/off like described. Again for everything it does do, it works well."
4,More than meets the eye,"Love stories come in many forms. On the surface, Song of Turand is the story of the romance between Alexa and Gregor. It is also the story of the love of a monarch for his people and his kingdom. Still, on another level it is a story of spiritual love and redemption. The author's use of vivid imagery makes this novel a joy to read. I couldn't put it down. The title leads us to believe that there is more to come. I for one will have a diffcult time waiting."
2,Did not like this.,"Did not like this too much.It is OK-ish, but has too much history of certain breeds and/or dog lines/ their ownersI was hopping for more info re: bred history, personality, how to deal with this small dog. etc.I think is more for professional breeders."
4,Traditional Greek meets Rock meets Folk,"This presents an interesting blend of Traditional Greek style, on Rock instruments with Folk lyrics. Great for anyone interested in genre blending music."
3,"An unusual choice for a re-issue, but not bad.","The New York Rock & Roll Ensemble was an early '70s group that included Michael Kamen, who went on to write movie and TV scores, and Mark Snow, the music man for ""The X-Files."" The group played a hybrid of rock and classical music and boasted some graduates of Juilliard. This album isn't bad, but had it been up to me I would've re-issued ""Roll Over,"" the group's best, and most rock-influenced, album."
4,sons review,"very happy , but with as with any toy made like this they do wear out, and you must absolutely not get them wet due to the steel internals"
4,Great action figures!,Great item! It was worth the money seeing my kids' faces. You can't find cool figures of the Sonic characters in just any store. Thanks!
1,They quickly became unbendable,"After one day the wires inside the toys broke and they became unbendable, not even able to remain upright, to the great dissapointment of my 5 year old, who is very careful with his toys. A good idea badly executed"
4,tough bendables,Good product...size is substantial enough for play...and the figures bend without breaking...standing up to playtime of 3 boys. so far so good.
3,A Not So Happy House Head From Chicago,"I am a true ""HOUSE HEAD""! I love bryon's wonderful, strong, and high ranged voice, but, most of the songs didn't move me like when he was in Ten City. ... I really enjoyed Searching, U Turn Me, That's the Way Love Is (of course, right?), I Could Be That, and even Stardance was O.K. I guess I was just expecting MORE and just became disappointed when I didn't get it. Well, I ordered the Purist too, so I hope this one will [be as good] and remember the Club Stories of the MUSIC BOX and Ron Hardy beating that wonderful BOX (if I could only turn back the hands of time). I give 3 stars only because he represents the HOUSE!!..."
4,These are gorgeous!,"I don't know if these are supposed to be dishwasher safe. We put them in the dishwasher before use and after letting the lid seal dry for a while they work great! They are kind of hard to pick up, especially when full of food. The neck isn't really big enough to put a measuring cup into. They are so pretty and hold so much that I don't care though. I can spoon the sugar into the measuring cup. They came really well packaged, no chance of breakage."
2,Can't make the keyboard work,"The keyboard feature in the copy I bought from Amazon.com does not work. I can't tell whether this is because the batteries are dead or not included, because I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPEN UP THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT! The instructions on the back say to use a screwdriver to remove the battery cover, but there are no screws visible and I cannot figure out what else I might possibly be able to move with a screwdriver. This might be a very neat book to have IF you can get the keyboard to work, but I really can't tell."
4,don't buy it from amazon,"good product, just don't buy it from amazon.I placed the order with amazon on March 6. Amazon kept delaying its shipment. It's May now and amazon, for the 3rd time, sent me email telling me there was a delay on the shipment.no wonder my favorite mutual fund short amazon stocks"
1,Waste of money,"One of the worst art books I've come across, it's going straight into the local charity collection. I bought it because the price was so low, but having seen it even one dollar would have been too much. And there are so many wonderful painting books to choose from: try Classical painting Atelier by Aristides instead."
4,Describes life in a magical college,"Basically gives the structure of a noraml magical college's staff, from apprentices to masters. Also includes several interesting spells and magic items and a few brief adventures. The biggest point is the new proficiencies introduced. They are also the biggest drawback as it will increase a wizard's powers again unless some descretion is applied."
4,A good reference for Wizard lovers,"I like the detailed oriented material, so this was right up my alley. This is great for anyone wanting to set-up a Wizards College or Mages Guild. Good ideas and useful material."
4,Scripture based study,Our 5 church study groups are doing this book for Lent 2013 and most found the study units helpful especially when the focus on spiritual listening is based on what can be gained from scripture passages.
2,Actually Mistitled,"Gee, a documentary that solves a question that has been studied for 2300 years. If you go by the title, and what the host says, then the History Channel has done a great service.Of course, they didn't do any of this. They did cover some interesting territory, and yet they left out so much (sack of Thebes, anyone?).Also, while the actor that portrayed Alexander was youthful and very good looking, I think he was more the Hephaistion type.All-in-all, I was disappointed. It's not as bad as the National Geographic documentary, but it's not much better."
3,Not the FULL True Story,"I, like others, am a bit disappointed. I knew little about Alexander the Great, other than that he had conquered and created a vast empire. Now I only know a little more military history after watching this documentary.I feel like this documentary doesn't tell the real reasons Alexander is considered a GREAT. What about the social impact his conquests had? How did he affect the world in a longstanding sense? His vast empire was split up and dissappeared upon his death, so according to the limited information this long video shows...why is he Great?From a bit of reading since watching this video, I have found that he wasn't great just because he was an awesome military leader...but because of his policy after the battle!Once again, the History Channel focuses too much on the ""football game history"" (which is okay if all you care about is how he beat up on the world) and not on the real historical impact of what the military conquest achieved!"
5,Always check Amazon.com before you buy...,"...I did and was glad to save over $10 compared to other retailers on this excellent docudrama about Alexander the Great's life. The History Channel did a spactacular job, accurate and understandable, unlike Stone's fragmented and shuffled treatment, IMHO."
4,This Book has plenty of Value!,"I really thought the previous review was extremely harsh, and I enjoyed this book, as I valued the variety of programs the author showed ACTUALLY WORKING.. These represented a LOT of work, and actually allowed a novice to scheme (ME) to get started..So, although I was tempted to give it 5 stars (since the other review was so bad), i still only gave it the 4 it deserves..if the other reviwer really values so poorly, he should write his own book..Well, i was very happy to have bought mine.."
4,nylon magazine,this magazine is really good for people who have unique style and it was a little different than what i expected. that may be because it was the music issue but still im not sure if all the clothing is my style. I wish i would have known a little more about the magazine before i bought it but i still like it so its good!
2,Not a great magazine for tweens!,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift from her very trendy aunt, but unfortunately it's a little to edgy and artistic for my tween's tastes (and mine). From the articles to the photo layouts, it's just too ""grown"" for a young tween. It would be more suitable for a girl in her late teens and early twenties."
1,i dont know,i have not recived this magazine yet so i cant put a review in. i hope it is shipped soon b/c i looked forward to reading it.
3,hmm,"3 months and still haven't received anything.3 stars, because I love the magazine, but not Amazon's slowness."
2,Hipsters Only,"For such a thin magazine this had a lot of ads. All of the ads were hyper-sexualised as well as much of the content.The rest of the content was boring or dumb. All of the writers acted like they were the first people to discover their topic. The fashion was bland and uninspired.If you think you are cool (but aren't really), this magazine is for you."
1,WTF?!?!,"alright so i ordered nylon in may and i got my first issue in july and it was fine and everything but then they totally shipped my august issue and i didnt get it and now i just recieved my issue for september and it is totally thrashed, so i dont know what the deal is but i am pissed that they skipped august and i am not liking this so far."
2,Never hated hipsters more,"I got this free the other day and I've been having a hard time getting through it. Expensive fashion and makeup, with some articles on music that focus on the band members' preference for skinny jeans. British cosmetic brands they wish were available here? Hotels with great spas? I'm not sure who the target audience is."
3,"Eye candy & I, I, I","A year's subscription for under 10 bux! Who can resist? So I signed up...even though I'm about twice as old as the other readers.The good? The fashion is a good mix between high-street and high fashion. And, definitely, not boring. This is also one of the very few fashion magazines that regularly features fashion illustrations. Quite lovely ones, at that. So, yes...five stars for the eye candy aspect.The bad? Any accompanying text from the cover to the last page. Lots of ""I"", ""me"", ""my""...first-person stuff. Which would have been OK if the writers have a more mature and/or unique voice. Very casual and self-referential writing.On second thought, maybe it's the appropriate tone for their intended market.So, $10 for 12 very pretty glossies... Not bad, I guess."
3,Well made and designed,This like most of the Lastolite products is well made. It's a little hard to mount and use outdoors in windy conditions but does what it needs to do - diffuse light.
3,Works well in limited experimental d&b context,"3 1/2At this point, anything Mr. Funk is putting down was worth a listen to the ears of the mechanically dense, but CW does fully embrace his earlier more noise-collage side at the expense of more far-ranging melodic appeal. This still results in a study compilation of the intense, out-of-control, momentary audio party drill-and-bass aficianados take for granted."
1,bigdoc,"Sent a cd by mistake still waiting for LP vinyl after returning cd to amazon, haven't got the lp or even a reply from amazon yet!"
4,Best childrens' book I've ever read,"I first read this book when I was in 3rd grade, now in my Senior year of high school, I still love to read it on rainy days. It allows children to open up to the parapsychology realm without too many shocking corners. The best part is when the characters are in the amusement park. The addition of a telepathic canine adds a humorous air to the story"
1,awfully & awkwardly written,"The title says it all. Many points in this book are repetitive, the dialogue is written without punctuation in the majority of the ending and the characters are bland. As a personal opinion, it lacked suspension. I found myself wanting to care but not being able to.Sorry! 1 star."
5,My favorite book as a kid!,"William Sleator quickly became my favorite childhood author after reading this book and I went on to read almost all of his books. This one started it all for me, and to this day I still love the story! It's filled with mystery and suspense that kept me reading and dynamic characters I cared about. From beginning to end, this book is a masterpiece for it's target audience and I hold it above many of the books I read to this day. William Sleator will always have a place on my bookshelf!"
1,No! Corn is BAD for rats and mice.,"I speak from experience. The nitrosamines that result of the corn consumption are carcinogenic; it's worse in mice (MUCH worse), but do you really want to take the risk with your rats? I've raised both rats and mice for a long time now (mice longer), and once I removed the corn from their diets did I notice an almost complete reduction in early murine death (mice fed diets that contained corn kernals in them died quicker/younger than mice without the corn).Also, these ingredients:whole corn, striped sunflower seed, pumpkin seed, shelled peanuts, jumbo green peas, almonds, pecans, walnuts, banana chipscombined will make your critters obese. There's just too much fat in this concoction to even think about giving it to them on a daily basis. I don't think I could ever recommend something like this, no matter if my rats ""liked"" it or not. For treats, maybe, but not as the main staple of their daily diet."
1,BOYCOTT BROWNS!!!,"Up until very recently, this was the only food I would feed my pet rats they were the only soy-free rat food on the market. My rats love this food. HOWEVER, FM Brown's has started using soy in their rat & mouse food within the past couple months. There is evidence to show, and my own experience is that soy is like POISON to rats. It cuts their lifespan in half and causes CANCER, particularly in females. Because FM Brown's recently made the decision to add the soy to their mix, the ingredients listed on Amazon are not even accurate. There is soy in the food and it is BAD for your rats!!! If you care about your ""babies"", please boycott FM Brown's and let them know you will not buy their products until they take out the soy!!!"
1,Rat Killer,Switched to this food for my fancy and dumbo rat. I had a hairless sphinx rat that i loved and one time she choked on this food and i was able to clear it out of her airway. The second time however I was not so fortunate and she suffocated in my hands and died! I will never use this product again and if you still do be sure and watch them eat incase anything happens!!
1,Not Garlic Scented But Very Scented,I was looking for Unscented Shampoo and Conditioner because of asthma and COPD But this stuff is quite the opposite and very strongly scented. Smells nice but strong. I understand its unscented garlic but the discription lead me to believe the products were totally unscented.Nutrine Garlic Conditioner Unscented 16 oz.Nutrine Garlic Shampoo Unscented 16 oz.
3,not exactly as pictured but it will do!!!,the links need to be welded together you swing it too fast and they like to stretch and it might come apart. I'm going to mig weld all the links and put a longer handle on it with something that will make it easier to hold on to. other than that this is a nice piece to defend yourself from anyone with a knife or any other kind of hand weapon
4,steel whipping chain,"Service was fast & good communication. The product arrived intact with no damages, would love to deal with them again."
4,Nice workmanship!,This was bought as a gift for my son. He likes it very much and has been practicing with it in the yard.
4,Classic Fritz Lang,"Fritz Lang directed some great films in Hollywood during the 1940s and The Woman in the Window is one of them. A professor's (Edward G. Robinson) chance encounter with a beautiful model (Joan Bennett) turns into a nightmare of nail-biting suspense. In a crazy turn of events, the mild-mannered Robinson kills Bennett's boyfriend in self-defense. What should Robinson and Bennett do next is the question. The course they choose propels this melodrama and hooks the viewer from the start. You find yourself pulling for both Bennett and Robinson's cover-up because the two are sympathetic and likeable characters. Taught direction, a great screenplay, combined with excellent characterizations from Robinson, Bennett, and Dan Duryea, make for great film entertainment."
4,A great thriller in the film noir genre.,"If you can enjoy a film with all the suspense and turns that each character can contribute to the story, then ""Woman In the Window"" is for you. The video is approx. 120 minuntes and had been digital restored to provide a crisp video and audio that will satisfy the film noir fan."
2,Careful--slippery ending ahead,"I won't be a spoilsport and give away the ending...but I will say that this film has a trick finish that pretty much defines the term ""deus ex machina."" (The ""machina"" in this case being the typewriter of a particularly cheesy, unscrupulous Hollywood scriptwriter.) With a bit of thought, one sees the sense of the whole thing...but IMO, no matter what writer and director were thinking, the ""ending"" is simply a dramatic cheat. This is one film noir where the old switcheroo happens not to some patsy in the film--but to the poor sucker watching the movie!You've been warned."
4,A really good movie,"This movie is done very good, the only thing I didn't like was the surprise ending. It's like taking away all that you experienced before. Why would anyone like that?"
1,Even Fritz Lang can make a stinker,"As far as films noir go, this one blows. Contrived garbage. See 'Scarlett Street' for fritz best work in this style. 'm' as well."
5,masterpiece that rivals Hitchcock,"this rare gem of a film rivals Hitchcock in suspense. i urge anyone who hasn't seen this film not to read any reviews before viewing it. don't cheat yourself out of a great viewing experience.i have been collecting classic films for years, first on video than dvd and i have never seen this great movie. the only movie that possibly comes close to the mind blowing experience this one does is ""Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"" which was released in 1956, 12 years after this one.i will not reveal any significant plot details in this review. just trust me that if you're a classic film conniseur as i am you won't be disappointed. sit down, dim the lights and prepare to be fully engrossed and enveloped into one of Fritz Lang's masterpieces.as for the DVD, the print is very good and so is the audio. no real extras here, but you don't need them. the film itself is sufficient."
5,Ginormous,"This is a huge and wonderful book.830 pages in a large format with a sewn binding. 9 pounds, over 1900 illustrations (most of them in color.)Appendices: Guidelines for Use of Live Amphibians and Reptiles in Field Research, a 14 page Index of Common Names, Measurement Conversion Factors."
4,Great resource for on-your-feet travel.,"My friends and I relied heavily on the Let's Go! Map Guide for our last trip to New York, so when I found out I was going to Berlin, a Let's Go Map Guide to Berlin was the obvious must-have.These maps are great because not only are they laminated (which protects the map from sudden bouts of pouring rain), but their compact size isn't so embarassing; they don't make you feel too much like a tourist when you whip them out. The descriptions of sights and attractions in the Berlin version cut to the chase, and are sometimes, hilariously irreverent.My only word of advice is that these map guides should only be used as a supplement to the larger, in-depth travel books.I also relied heavily on the map guides I bought for Amsterdam and Prague."
1,Disappointing...,I could not read past the first chapter...what I did read was poorly written and failed to hold my interest on any level at all.
4,not bad,"i was expecting more from Sporty, his style seems to have gone down since them Big Boy days. he needs to stop recycling songs. i like ''Buck & Tha Preacher'' tha best on this album."
5,Loved the flag,Flag lover. Loved the history behind the flagas well as the price. Came quick and worth the priceI paid.
5,Seriously,"This album is awesome, and is a certifiable evidence of the band's awesomeness. Intricacy of instrumentalism leads to an expressionistic experience of the manic, epic human experience. Give it a try?"
2,It is great!!!,"I am 12 yeas old and I love the game! I love how you can create your own routes. Also, you can drive your trains in many different countries and the trains are so detailed. If you love trains, then then YOU SHOULD BUY THE GAME!!!"
2,MAn in Motion,"I got this CD to fill out my collection. After listening to it after a 15-20 year gap, I was not impressed with it. Only one or two really good tunes..the rest are Night Ranger-like, however, don't have a catchy tune or inspired riffs."
5,CD Song List,1. 4:27 Man In Motion2. 4:11 Reason To Be3. 4:43 Don't Start Thinkin'4. 4:06 Love Shot Me Down5. 4:41 Restless Kind6. 5:19 Half Way To The Sun7. 4:22 Here She Comes Again8. 4:14 Right On You9. 4:34 Kiss Me Where It Hurts10. 4:49 I Did It For Love11. 4:41 Woman In Love
4,a good solid rock album,"Man In Motion is a good solid rock album.I don't know if it's the absense of keyboardist Alan Fitzgerald or some other factor, but this album seems to me, as Night Ranger albums go, to be missing something. Not that it's a bad album. Just a little less of that something that makes me like Night Ranger, rather than other equally talented bands. It is, however, in no way a bad album.If you're a fan of melodic hard rock, give Man In Motion a try. It's a good solid album that won't disappoint."
5,Could have been a classic,"Man in motion could have really done well. Production with layered vocals was a little down when this album came out, but the songs are really quite good. You have the solid beat ""Man in motion"" to lead the way, and a complete list of songs that make a lot of sense musically. I remember DJing several of the songs at a club, and people were wondering and requesting these songs repetively. Keith Olsen was a great producer for many Rock/Pop genres, and his influences are shown here. His noted work with Sammy Hagar, Bad Company, Rick Springfield, and a ton of others shows the distinct style of blending arrangements. Great Album overall!!"
4,In Motion to Damn Yankees,"Am I grading this too high? Well, when I like an artist or group, I am probably a bit biased. Don't Start Thinking (I'm Alone Tonight) is the track that got my attention right away. Overall, another solid performance from the group. I feel this is another ""must have"" for Night Ranger fans. Again, I picked up the CD to replace my original copy. My original was on cassette this time. I followed Jack on to Damn Yankees from here."
3,written for a different time,"This is a very sweet syrupy love story. The main man in the story has a terrible reputation, when he rescues a lady from a river. They fall in love, but are unable to be together for a long time because her family doesn't approve of him. I thought it was quite wordy, and skimmed over a lot of the pages to get to the point.The writing is very different than today's novels. Instead of saying, ""she bent over and kissed him,"" the author wrote, ""she bent over and laid her lips on his.""I wondered what the readers of that time period thought when they read this book."
3,Hero isnt a saint for once,The finding of Jasper Holt is a sweet story of idealized love trust and faith. Jasper is a law unto himself. He makes and keeps his own laws. He saves the life of a naive sheltered pastor's daughter and they 'fall in' friendship/adoration. She is visiting her much elder sister. Sister and brother-in law hate/fear Jasper. He nobly refuses to 'distress' her family by pressing suit until....
3,Missing Parts of Chapter Nine,I love to reread Grace Livingston Hill books over and over. This kindle version is missing the first few pages of chapter 9. I verified it by pulling the book off of my bookshelf to see just what was missing. About 3 pages of the first part of chapter 9 are missing. LOTS of TYPOS!!!!
5,Tokyo Disneyland Music Album,"This CD is a must for any Disney Theme Park Collector. It contains soundtracks from many of the most popular attractions at Tokyo Disneyland. The Mickey Mouse Revue, Haunted Mansion, Peter Pan's Flight, It's A Small World,, Pinocchio's Daring Journey, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Enchanted Tiki Room ""Get the Fever!"", Coutry Bear Jamboree, Meet The World, Cinderella's Golden Carousel, Splash Mountain, Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin & Mickey & Minnie's House In Toontown. Some of the 22 tracks I had never heard before, like Meet The World. I am an avid collector of Disney Theme Park music and probably have about 99% of the available soundtracks of Disneyland and Walt Disney World. So I was pleasantly surprised to find some tracks I didn't already have from Peter Pan's Flight and Roger Rabbits Car Toon Spin and others. Some of the tracks are in English and some are in Japanese. I recommend this CD highly to any Disney Theme Park collector."
4,Awsome but not subtitles,"This picture is unique, but sadly is without spanish subtitles, so I couldn't share it with my friends and family"
1,Price is Ridiculous!!!!,This is an excellent movie. But the price that's being asked for it is just plain ridiculous. I will wait until I can get a copy for $20.00. I dont know how these people can sleep at night. They should wear masks!!!
2,Worth about $30,I too snatched this bike up a couple years back on clearance for $36 or something. It was my first real road bike and it was alright. The components are really cheap and my derailer broke and I spent about $100 fixing flat tired over the bikes about one year lifetime. My advice is that if you can buy it for $50 or less go for it. It's a great bike to figure out if you like road riding or not (however the shock absorption of it was terrible). But if you have the money I would recommend going with an entry level Giant or Cannondale or something like that for around $700. It may seem like a lot but you won't have to buy a new bike every year.
4,historic travels,Here's an excellent introduction to an historic non-European world traveler. Young children will enjoy the pictures and the well told story of Inb Battuta. Why isn't this story in our history books alongside the many stories about Marco Polo?
4,"Ibn Battuta, traveling man","Ibn Battuta travelled 75,000 miles in his lifetime, 3x more than Marco Polo, more than any man before steam, and I'm just now learning about him. Amazing fellow."
3,I was duped,Warning - this is NOT the book written by Ibn Batuta himself. This is a book of illustrations based on the traveller. Yes they are very beautiful illustrations but for the text you have to getthe Ibn Batuta book written by Ibn Batuta. I learned this the hard way.
4,Ibn Battuta,"This picture book is a beautifully illustrated picture book of one man's journey to Mecca. As a Christian, I appreciated this book for an explanation of the Muslims'a pilgrimage without being inundated with a lot of emphasis on the religion. It was more of a tale of the journey itself, filled with cultural imagery. The illustrations are lovely and creatively show the handwriting, animals, geography, architecture, and other elements of that time period and region."
3,GOOD for KIDS,Very short read but very good for kids or young teens. Im definitely wanting to get more books by or about ibn Battuta.
5,I give it my higest marks!,"This is an excellent book not just in the principles it teaches you, but also in holding your hand through step by step application. I can't speak highly enough of this book!"
4,Magellan Meridian GPS (Yellow/Black),"I am very impressed with the performance and reliability of this product. There is a learning curve with which one must deal, however, easily overcome by using the included CD Rom Users Manual. Secure Digital Cards from various manufactures can be purchased affordably, yet maps seem to only be downloadable from Magellan Mapsend Software, and not some of the other popular varities"
2,Missed The Mark,"This movie had some good points and good acting. They did show how God can turn anyone's life around. No one is beyond God's Grace. Yet, where the movie fell flat was the ""Christian couple"" that was friends with Norris and his girlfriend. They preached it, yet they didn't quite live it. They weren't married and they were having sex...yet the movie made it seem like it was all right because they were ""faithful"" to each other. Come on...that's not Biblical. It could have been a very good movie...but this one point really blew it for me."
5,First rate Christian Movie!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this moving, realistic movie that has a message that is timely and relevant. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that it doesn't matter if a movie has ""secular"" actors. The term secular has become such a dirty word among so-called Christians. I am a born again, Bible-Believing Christian myself, but it really saddens me to hear my fellow Brothers & Sisters in the Lord be so narrow and bigoted.This film is so touching and well made and extremely well acted. Ving Rhames was also executive producer, so this may be a clue to where is heart really is these days.Whether you are a believer or not, please give this wonderful film a try!In Jesus' NameKelly PerkinsTyler, TX"
4,Saving God,"This was a good movie with a great message. I enjoy movies about redemption. We have all made poor decisions, but there is always hope."
4,great dvd player but........,"i thoroughly enjoy this product and recommend it but after 11 months the on/off switch broke and i am unable to use it. called mintek customer service and they told me a technician would return my call in 24-48 hours. its been 24 hours and no one has called. dont know why you cant just call customer service and speak to a technician. any way, the picture quality is excellent and sound is good but think it could be a little bit better at times."
5,GREAT player,"Actually, my son purchased this. He plays it at home and when we travel. It it a GREAT DVD player!! No problems, wonderful performance!!"
1,Unifersal fan.,This is a universal fan that fits many different makes of vehicles. I bought it for my 1990 Jeep Cherokee. I returned it and bought the one made for the Jeep because the Jeep one has the sensor that turns it on automatically. This fan is for the AC.
4,Helpful...,"The book itself is very helpful. I wish that tutorial books such as this would present the bottom line code first and then go back and explain. This one presents several different versions of a certain script, then improves on them in future chapters. I would have preferred doing it the best way the first time.Also, another reviewer mentioned that the binding was faulty. Mine was as well. The very first time I opened it, the back of the pages tore from the spine. It's been a pain to use, but I really needed the information and didn't have time to send it back. Since I used it extensively and highlighted important info, I'm probably pretty much stuck with it now."
5,Great Book!!!,"Excellent Book. It's not to slow yet it never assumes that you know how to do something. It goes step by step through every php and sql command, explaining how it works and when to use it and then it gives simple examples to follow up to see how it commands works.I hightly recommend this book."
3,Good book for beginners but not for professional,"I bought this book 3 months ago and really enjoyed it. The book does teach you the basic of how to build dynamic pages, connect to a database, and security. However, i would not recommend it to professionals simply because it doesn't use the stands that everyone else is using such as object oriented programming (OOP).After reading this, i turned to the online community for extra info but found myself trapped as most tutorials and examples use OOP (which is the core of php).If you're a beginner looking to build your first SIMPLE dynamic website, this book is for you but if you're a professional looking to enhance your site, i would skip this book."
5,A stylus that works!,"I bought a stylus when I purchased the Infuse at the ATT Phone store ($16.00)because I have big fingers. It worked until I lost it (about a week). The black color was no big help. I found the Samsung version on the internet and bought two (figured I would loose another one). It works as good or better than the original at a fraction of the cost, and the color has been a big help when it falls in odd places. This is a great tool for texting (swype) and selecting even through a protective cover. A month later I still have two)."
4,An enlightening look at a forgotten artist,"This documentary descirbes the life of Chevalier Saint Georges, an eighteenth-century violinist, composer, conductor, and champion fencer who was of African decent. He was a contemporary of Mozart's, even inspiring the more well-known composer in his music, yet today he is virtually unknown.The film is slightly cheesy in parts, but the information about this amazing and little-known musician more than compensates. There is also some great excerpts performed by Tafelmusik of Saint George's work.A very interesting film."
4,St George,"I first saw part of this video on the CBC television network, I was enthralled I am a music lover but was not aware of this great composer!!Buy it, watch it it's full of beautiful music and an amazing story."
4,The Hardy Boys in Egypt...What could be better?,"As a ""Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries"" fan, I found this video to be a real treat! It features the Hardy Boys in an exotic, mystery filled location and throws in some 1970's disco to boot! I especially enjoyed the inclusion of the original intro to the program followed by the announcement ""Tonight on the Hardy Boys.."" This video is great for those who love 1970's nostalgia."
3,One of the best Hardy Boys episodes I've ever seen!,"A good storyline which features alot of the characters from the storybook such as Chet Morton and Callie Shaw. Non-stop good action fun in this episode as they try to solve an unsolved mystery of creatures, screaming people and missing clues. Well acted for that era in the late 70's, but the new baby boomers will find it a drag since there's other shows now like the X-Files and so on."
5,Outstanding Variety,"Great CD! Lots of different styles that vary from one track to the next. Makes me think ZZ Top and Blues Traveller have gotten together and made an album. This band rocks stone cool! And the Drummer, what can I say, he's got some mean licks. Hats off to the Pumpkin!"
3,"Here's an alternative, you Dan fans","This is one of those semilegal releases from overseas with demos recorded by Becker and Fagen before Steely Dan (when, among other things, they played with Jay and the Americans). Depending on your level of dedication and ethical position, you might alternatively consider ""Android Warehouse,"" which contains these demos and more. But you really should love the boys before delving into this stuff - it's lacking the high production values of most of their work."
4,i really like this cd,"to me sensational has that raw realness that i appreciate in underground punk rock music. the beats are messed up but they are really effective. this may sound cerebrial, but sensationals style has a meta proto hip hop quality that i find valuable. like double dutch bus, or some neighborhood shhh that existed or would have existed if hip hop wasnt a big industry. a superficial hip hop head might dog this cd because it doesnt play by the rules established by the mainstream underground. they cant judge it by the points they are taught to appreciate. but bebop probly sounded wack to all the swing cats back in the day."
1,MINUS TEN BILLION STARS,"This is a terrible album if you can even call it an album. I would more describe it as amature karaoke night garbage gone bad. this is not music OH NO this is just cheesy and sloppy sequencer patterns put together 5 minutes before the album was supposed to go into stores. The lyrics are some of the worst I have ever heard this guy doesnt ryhme on beat or anywhere near the beat and to the reviewers giving this five stars and calling this a classic album and saying that this is ""so punk rock man"" have you lost your mind???? had a recent frontal lobotomy??? has music gotten so trite, dry, and boring that we have to resort to this type of amature garbage. The fact that this guy was even able to to put out an album and actually have fans only shows the mind state of the average ""music fan."" you want some REAL Hiphop check out the Starving Artist Crew, Non Phixion or People Under The Stairs."
5,A Must Read,"This is THE place to start for an overview of Christian Theology. Macleod is clear and to the point. He covers the main doctrines of Christianity thoroughly yet in concisely. He is not content to give simplistic answers and plums the depths of the Scriptures to arrive at a thoroughly biblical position.This book would be a good place to start for anyone looking for a first read on theology, yet it will also give profound insight to the experienced student of theology."
3,"Interesting, yet left me with questions",I thought the book was very good. I was quite interested but I just thought it would end differently. I had remaining questions. It seemed like it just ended. I wanted more. The book kept me reading because I wanted to see what would happen to Angela
3,If only the clamps for this seat were wider,"This is a high-quality, sturdy seat that folds easily for storage. My 8-month old daughter sits easily in it, and the straps work well. My 18-month old nephew also has the seat, and he hangs from the chair (in attempts to climb into it), and it doesn't move. The seat is great for restaurants and visiting people's homes who don't have high chairs.I would be ecstatic about this seat if the clamps were about an inch wider - then they would fit on the picnic benches at campgrounds and parks. My husband is going to rig something up so that we can use it with the tables anyway, but it sure would be nice if it just worked without extra pieces."
5,Excellent product,Fold flat and surprisingly light. The handles look industrial - which I like because that translates into a very sturdy hold. Looking forward to bringing along for a cross-country beach trip...may need to get another for the other car.
1,Who Engineered This Thing?!!!!,"I purchased two ""metoo"" chairs for my twin girls. Clearly neither Phil or Ted are engineers. THE CLAMPS SUCK!!!! Why would you not employ standard ""C Clamp"" technology on this chair the fixed flat portion of the bolt results in friction with bottom of your targeted surface which makes it virtually impossible to tighten well. Standard ""C"" clamps employ a floating heading that sets still while you tighten the clamp. The addition of the rubber sleeves is even more dangerous since it introduces a softer cushion that easily slips. The fact that the ""Lobster"" has been introduced shows this chair was not the ""ultimate"" product. Phil, Ted, you made a pretty lousy product; what are you going to do about it?!!!!!"
4,MeToo,It is a very light and compact chair and the baby enjoys sitting up to the counter in it. Would recommend to others.
1,WARNING!! Recalled by Government!!,"The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued an alert on 5/6/11 concerning some models of these chairs. You should visit their website and read the alert prior to purchasing them. ""CPSC is urging consumers to stop using some metoo clip-on chairs immediately."" There are fall and amputation hazards."
2,"not good for small babies, get the inglesina fast table chair instead","my baby is around the 25th percentile in size for a 6-month old, and the harness on this chair was ridiculously loose even when fully tightened around her. that is my primary reason for returning this. the secondary reason is because the design is very poor:- the seat cover is permanently fixed to the frame which makes it a challenge to clean- the seat has minimal padding and the back is low. the inglesina version is padded and the seat back is taller.- the parts of the frame that come into contact with the top and underside of a table seem poorly thought out compared to Inglesina's version. the inglesina fast table chair has much larger grips that hold the chair to a table. it is overall heavier but i feel like it has a much more secure grip than the Metoo."
4,good ligh chair alternative,"fits most restaurant tables (not all though), and when it does fit, it's better than using the resturant high chairs. Baby can sit in it comfortably, and it's not too hard to take along."
2,Doesn't fit 50% of tables!,"This product is GREAT when it fits the table you want to use it on. However, the table has to pretty much have no lip, not be made of glass, and not be too thick. We purchased this as a traveling high chair for my daughter and unfortunately, I can't tell you the number of times that the seat has not fit on restaurant tables or tables at houses we're visiting. It's no use to buy such an expensive chair when we literally could not use it half the time. We're looking into other options that have mechanisms that will give us more options in terms of the types of tables we can use it on."
1,Dangerous Product,This product injured my toddler when it dumped him from our counter top. I think this product has been subject to a recall for precisely this reason.
5,Me Too Chair,Love this travel chair! securely fastens on tables and counters. folds flat which is awesome for travel and cleans up easily.only wish is that there was some way to keep the mess a little more contained like a traditional highchair does.
4,"Musing with the Dance, Dancing with the Muse","I love Chris Spheeris and his music, so don't get me wrong. When I rate this four stars, it's only because some of his other albums are worth 5 stars! This is a bit more laid back, a bit more repitive, and although lovely, and soulful, my soul gets full a bit sooner here than with other albums he has done. Perhaps with more thematic transitions, a broader overall vision for the album, focused on a stronger central theme, these could have elevated it to a 5. Of course, then the title would have needed to be different...somthing like...Dream Visions of the Pita Baker Lost Off the Rocky Cliffs of Crete. We could then have had a lot of ocean sounds, surf and splashing, sea birds and the ancient curses of an old embittered Pita Baker as he rows futiley against a strong headwind, dangerously close to jagged rocks, whilst the sea birds ruin his hat, his Pita bread and his dreams of long lost youth. The Pathos!"
2,Highly over-rated.,"I knew I shouldn't have wasted money on this c.d. I bought it because of the rave reviews. Got home, put the c.d. in, and within minutes I was shaking my head at the awful mistake I had made in purchasing it. Because I have been exposed to similar music that is superior to music on this c.d., it was a set up for pure disappointment. But then again we all don't have exactly the same tastes in music."
1,ITEM NOT RECEIVED SO FAR,"I have purchased few Music CD,s from Amazon.com last August , this is the only ITEM NOT RECEIVED SO FAR.Tried to contact thrughe amazon web site , but could not do it."
3,Nice Colors in a SMALL package,"These oils have really nice colors available. I love colored lamp oils in my old glass lamps. The blue is especially pretty. I even combined some to make a different shade. HOWEVER, the bottles are really small, and one bottle doesn't quite fill a regular size glass lamp. It does fine for a lamp with a small basin/reservoir. As for burning, I cannot rate them for smell or smoking qualities, because I haven't burned them this winter. I keep mine mostly for display, and to use during power outages. I gave it 3 stars for ""quantity for the price I paid""......the price with shipping added in was just more than I thought it should be for these small little bottles."
5,coleman battery lantern,We won't be in the dark if and when another hurricane comes our way. The lantern is bright.........happy with it.
4,Does the job - lots of batteries,"This light is actually very nice! It puts out a lot of light, but the amount of batteries it takes it kind of ridiculous though."
5,"Great, inexpensive lantern",We used this for tent camping recently. The lamp was plenty bright at the campsite and in the tent. Like the fact that it's electric so I can leave on in the tent without worrying about it.
3,mixed,"this is a really good light and very very bright, however it uses 8 D batteries and can get expensive fast. If money is no object its perfect"
5,Powerful Light,"This was wonderful during a week-long power outage during Hurricane Sandy. I got over 30 hours of power on the first set of batteries, and there is probably more left. Highly recommended."
3,good lantern,"The item was delivered on time and in good condition,. this was a holiday gift for someone so I can not make a review on how it works or the operation at this time. I will check with the person that I gave it to at a later date to see how they like it and it's general operation"
3,Pretty Good Lantern,"This worked well in lighting up a small area, but definitely did not light up the entire campsite (or even just the cooking area). Trying to prepare and eat dinner proved troublesome due to lack of light. it was just bright enough to make out objects, but not see it too clearly unless the lantern was right next to it. Worked well in lighting up my 2-person tent, though."
4,Dependable but not ultra-bright,I received one of these lanterns as a gift a few years ago and have found it to be handy and dependable both for camping and for when the electricity goes off. So I gave one as a gift this year. I like the battery type because you don't have any fire and there are no mantles to break. It is better than rechargable because you can replace batteries immediately. However this is not as bright as a propane lantern. Ruth
2,Can't leave the Batteries in the Lantern,"Bought this because of all the storm we were getting our power kept going out.Read the review and description it looked perfect, bought it and put thebatteries in and it's nice. Turned it off and put it away and 3 week later goto turn it on and it lit for about 30 sec.So I guess you can't put the batteries in until you are readyto use it."
2,"Arrived broken, bad customer service","This lantern was to replace the previous Coleman that died for no reason. This one arrived broken, shedding a faint blue light no brighter than a candle. Coleman material says contact them. They have limited phone hours. The e-mail to customer service went unanswered. I did get through by phone several days later and the nice lady at Coleman did ship a replacement bulb and then everything was fine. They finally answered the e-mail 31 days later and asked that the lantern be shipped back to them. Not even clear who pays return shipping."
3,Disappointed that it is not rechargeable.,"I was disappointed that this lantern is not rechargeable. It takes a lot (8) D batteries. I am sure that it noted this in the description, but I failed to notice it. However, I am going to keep the lantern for emergencies and such. Maybe the batteries will last longer than I think."
3,Battery operated lantern,"I bought the wrong one...I bought the one that was battery operated but I wanted the one that was recharable. So, I returned it, which, by the way, was so easy to do."
5,Great table lantern for camping!,"I've been using a Coleman propane lantern for years and while it's great when it's hung from a nearby tree, it's not the best to have at your picnic table. A broken globe and a few accidental bumps with an arm later and I decided to add this battery powered option to the collection. I recommend high capacity rechargeable D batteries to help boost its run time. It has exceeded my expectations and I know I'm not tossing 8-16 D batteries into the garbage at the end of my weekend. Lantern (including the globe) is made of durable hard plastic. It's not heavy, but has a solid feel to it. Bright in both low and high settings. Does not get hot to the touch, so it's perfectly safe on your picnic table. There's still a place for my propane lantern on my campsite, but thanks to this reliable lantern it's far away from the table!"
5,a GREAT BIG light,Recently we had a black out and my small lantern did not work so we worked off candles. I have a small child and knowing that isn't safe the next day I ordered this lantern. I was so shocked by the BIG size when it arrived that I am glad I made the purchase.. We will never be in the dark again and I am thrilled to know that the candles will never have to be lit again for a power outage... GREAT purchase. Thanks Coleman
4,pretty good!,This is pretty good! The light is not all that bright but it works well for those times when we need to see what's going on in the barn at night. And it's been great in our recent power outages. I do recommend it.
2,Great Lantern while it lasted which wasn't long,"This lantern is NOT weather resistant, whatever the product description might say. I left it out in a not very-heavy rain overnight. The next night, the light wouldn't turn on and I gave up. A couple of days later I opened the base and found that the base was full of water and the batteries and copper contact points had corroded. One of the copper points broke off, rendering the lantern useless. I called Coleman support to request a replacement base -- because the only thing wrong is one broken contact -- and was told they had discontinued that part. So, my only option is to throw the lantern away and buy a new one. I can promise that the replacement won't be a Coleman lantern."
2,Batteries are expensive,"It takes 8 D batteries and the lantern only runs for about 10 hours on high, not 18 like it claims. Also the clear plastic shield for the light scratches easy enough to scratch it with your fingernail on accident. I would suggest a propane lantern if your looking to light up your camp at night, cheaper and brighter. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it will make a decent tent light until it gets too scratched up."
5,Everything good gets discontinued.,"I love this product, unfortunately I can't get it any longer. Apparently Lipton has discontinued this Honey & Lemon flavor. So sad. Amazon should stop advertising it."
5,"Wonderful, nectar!","This is my new favorite. I couldn't quite drink as much water as my doctor recommended, but now that I can pour in a packet of this tea, no problems at all. This is a great flavor, and my local grocer kept running out of this one. I recommend this to any tea lover."
4,Best instant summer beverage on the market,"I love this stuff. Tasty, no calories, not too sweet, better than the awful Crystal Light. Hard to find, 'tho. American's love their sweet soda! Ignore the other reviews. If you like green tea, this is great stuff."
4,Second best,"I'm addicted to the cherry flavor but it can be so hard to find, this is my fallback flavor. Not too strong or too sweet."
5,"The best, the absolute best",This is the best product that Lipton has ever come out with. It is only now appearing in some of our markets - I usually stock up on business trips - now I can get it on-line.Try this - you will probably not get the black teas anymore. I wish Lipton would make unsweetened green tea mix.
5,Beautiful Work,"This book includes General and Mrs. Lee in 3 stages of their life: as young a young couple about to be married, during the 1840s with their children, and during the war with their adult children. It includes many of General Lee's uniforms, and his famous horse, Traveller. This is a must for Civil War buffs(especially Southern ones!) and paper doll fans."
5,Ron the carpenter,"Yes fit on the pick up truck perfectly...but dummy me decides not to read the directions. I pull the spring clip off the end and of course it went flying into the grass. Gone for ever, so Like normal. a 50 cent item made for a bad day...so I went to the Ford dealer and you know the story they only sell the whole part not the little dohicky spring. I now will have to spend another 20 dollars to get a 50 cent clip...anyhow, I decide to call the company that made the shock explained what happened to the flying spring...very nice company they mailed me a new spring with in a week... And in todays world they didnt have to do that but they did my hats off to strong arm!!!!!"
3,Not His Best,"This is not even near to Jim Cymbala's best book.Before buying this book I'd get his previous titles:""Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire"" and ""Fresh Faith"" and ""Fresh Power"".I highly recommend all three of those titles. They have truly impacted my life."
5,Powerful and atmospheric,"A great instrumental album. New age gone primal. I really enjoy this disk and my only complaint is that it was too short! The crispness of the percusion and the flow of the work is, IMHO, energising and uplifting. If I play it while I am working the time jsut flies by and I find the disk is over before I know it.Highly recommended"
5,Olympus DM-20 Review,"I did a lot of research on this item before buying it. The buttons are well placed, making it feel like a regular voice recorder. The sound is excellent, even without a special microphone."
5,Good for lectures,"Excellent unit for large lecture halls with 100+ people. It works great with my Mac and I've downloaded the audio files with no problem. It does eat through batteries quite rapidly. I have it set at the highest quality for some of my lecturers who tend to mumble. It picks up the lecture voices very well, but I can only get about 16-18 hours of recording from it. Nonetheless, I think it was a worthwhile purchase."
1,Awful for voice recording,"My recorder keeps going mysteriously into a mode where it stops recording if the person stops talking (assuming you are recording voice), which is supposed to conserve your storage space. But what happens is that the recorder cuts off the person prematurely, making the recording virtually USELESS. This is a disastrous problem.Also, the interface is not at all intuitive."
3,Low Battery could make the screen go from English to Chinese (or Japanese) mode.,"When batteries go low or the device isn't used for a long time and batteries are replaced, it can suddenly give you a menu in Chinese or Japanese instead of English. I had to call Olympus customer support to fix. Fix is below:1) Take off hold and put in voice mode. (2) Press 'display menu' button for a couple seconds to get to menu mode. (3) scroll down (using the lower end of the 'fast forward' button) by hitting it 6 times. (4) hit 'play' button once (5) scroll down once (using the fast 'forward button' again). (6) hit 'play' button once,(7) scroll down once (using the 'fast forward' button yet again), 8) hit 'play' button once. A bar will show up across the bottom of the screen (it takes a few seconds as the bar goes solid black). This reformats the recorder (you lose any recordings on it) and puts it back in English. You can try to download files before this to keep from losing any files on your recorder."
5,Best Choice,"I spent a great deal of time reviewing similar products. This product exceeded my expectations. It is used for security and the sound is excellent. The battery life and storage capacity are a more than enough. The docking station is perfect. It does not even require software. Put the batteries in, set the date & time, and I was rolling. I highly recommend this product."
3,Olympus voice Recorder,The earphones don't work with other headphones with similar size plugs/jack. Very disappointing
1,im confused,"ok, the fisrt person up there said it wasn't the nirvana with kust cobain. and the person below said it was. what the heck is going on?"
1,Lounge blues,"Don't get me wrong, I am a Peter Green fan but this CD is not even close to his best work!! I read a review that inspired me to buy it. Just be cautious of reviews. Listen to samples b-4 buying."
4,music A+ but the DVD format a bit lacking,"the music included in these disks are just top notch. however, having seen the programs on PBS, i regret that the producer did not include the entire program (inclusive of interviews with artists) on an extensive DVD/CD compilation. this DVD/CD is at best a tip of the iceberg compared with what is shown on PBS.caution. for jazz fan who is also into HDTV, the HD DVD is a problem. the disk box states as 16X9 HD but the image does not fill up a typical 16x9 HDTV screen like the original boardcast. rather the DVD produces the image in letter box format. this is disappointing/. so, if you expect to see a true DVD in HD format filling up your 16x9 HDTV screen, the DVD disk will not meet your needs. however, if this is the least of your concern, this is the DVD/CD set you must own.note to producer. please release the ENTIRE program in box DVD/CD set and fix the 16x9 dvd format. i will love to own this. thanks."
5,Captain Tylor- Just Right,This DVD collection was purchased for my sister's Christmas present. This series arrived before estimated date. My sister recently finished watching the series and she said she enjoyed it.
1,Hard to comprehend,I just received my first issue. It was a tiny pamphlet. It was very hard to comprehend. It came from the UK and the English was difficult to understand. This is not the Answers in Genesis publication and is very radical and nearly scary.
5,not that 'herby',"I am ordering two more of these cookbooks today, to keep as gifts. I received Marge's book as a gift and let it sit on a shelf for two years, thinking it to be about herbs. Then one day I was looking for a good cheesecake recipe and found one in Best of Thymes. The pages for boursin, honey-mustard dressing, chocolate cake and potato salad are stained and worn. I think of this as my most basic, go-to cookbook now."
3,aka... too many titles,"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# GCD-785-2, Playing Time 48:38Yep, me again... and yes, that's another version of CHICAGO's ""Toronto Rock & Roll Revival 1969"" CD. I'm constantly amazed as to how many times this thing is on the marketplace.As usual, ""Beginnings"" is in fact ""Introduction"". The recording quality is below average, but the performances are adequate, considering how ""young"" the band was at this stage, with only 1 album under their belt.I've lost count of the various editions of this disc. If you own ANY of their live albums besides ""At Carnegie Hall"", ""Live In Japan"" and ""Chicago 26"", remember that you already have this, in some form or another..."
2,Be warned,"This CD should be avoided at all costs. It has been out in various forms, such as Live `69, Live in Toronto, Chicago Live, etc...., and it is an embarrasment to the Group. This is a soundboard recording of the group at the Toronto Rock Festival in 1969, and the sound quality is horrid. The group had absolutely nothing to do with it`s release so the banner on the cover is funny because this is nothing more than a bad bootleg. I would only imagine a compleatist would want this sorry CD."
3,More Historical than quality but still pretty cool,"These 7 songs are pretty cool to listen to if you think of the historical aspect behind it. The opening is pretty cool....they introduce the band as ""the group that said they wouldn't play"". I'm not sure when the concert was recorded but there are three songs, for me, that make it all worth it. The only reason why I gave this only three stars is because of the quality....I don't know if it was cut directly from an old record or just recorded wrong, but besides that, the songs are interesting to listen to. Heck, for [the money] you can't really go wrong."
2,"Chicago - 'Beat The Bootleggers, Live 1967' (Griffin Music) 2 1/2 stars","So-so quality budget release from the folks at Griffin Music. Actually, the tunes on this cheap-o CD isn't all that bad. Completists, die-hards as well as archivists are likely to get more out of this disc than the average fan. I sort of liked checking out these early live versions of ""Beginnings"", their Spencer Davis Group cover ""I'm A Man"" {must admit Chicago plays it a bit different than everyone else}, ""25 Or 6 To 4"" and the sixteen-minute ""Liberation"". After two - maybe three plays, it gets old."
4,A Complete Track Listing,"Given the truncated (and slightly misspelled) track listing presented above, I thought I'd try and offer a more complete version:1. I've Heard That Song Before2. I Don't Want to Walk Without You3. I'll Walk Alone4. It's Been a Long, Long Time5. Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)6. Five Minutes More (Give Me)7. Things We Did Last Summer, The8. Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry9. Papa Won't You Dance With Me10. It's Magic11. Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend12. If You Hadn't, But You Did13. Just in Time14. Party's Over, The15. Everything's Coming up Roses16. Small World17. Time After Time18. Comes Once in a Lifetime19. Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow20. People21. Sunday"
1,Don't Buy This Scam Publication,"These guys have some kind of scam going on.I didn't order this publication but they sent me a review copy, then a bill, then another review copy, then another 2 bills.I didn't pay the billing cause I never ordered the publication. They did not send any more publications either.Today I get a collection notice from a collection agency, North Shore Agency, out of Columbus, OH."
1,useless information with bad customer service,Do not get a subscription to this magazine. All the info inside you can find in Internet! There is nothing new inside!The subscription is very cheatty! They might say the first issue is free but then send you bill for another 10. The do repport the $20 to the collection agency and do not speak with customer over the phone!
5,Great CD!,"This CD is some of the best music we have ever listening to! It is very beautiful! A great addition to our massive CD collection. We enjoy listening to it at home, as well as driving in our car. I would highly recommend this CD!"
3,So and so for me,This CD may be for you if you like this type of music (new age music?). But not for me or for those who like acoustic (unplugged) music.
3,Follows the trend,"Pastor Cymbala follows the great work he started in the previous books, which I read. In this book though, it seems he stumbles so much over, and becomes preoccupied with, the diety of the Holy Spirit. It's so much easier to say the Spirit of God, the One true God, rather than his constant struggle to place a difference between 'God the Holy Spirit', 'the Spirit of Jesus', etc. . . make it simple pastor. . it's only one Spirit. . the Spirit of God. . and it was all made manifest in Jesus the Christ."
3,The in-between book,"I love Jim Cymbala. I got Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire for everyone in our church. That was a book created out of a life of work and growth. Fresh Power is okay, but not up to the first book, nor as good as Fresh Faith (which came later). Read it, but after the other two."
4,Crosley -- Great Fun Power-Pop!,"Crosley's freshman offering, OFF THE LAUNDRY, is a great collection of pop songs. The music is tight, the writing is fun and catchy, and the riffs will stick with you. Vince's voice soars on songs like GIRL LIKE YOU and SOUL SURVIVE, and the first cut, AUTOMATIC, will have you tapping your toes on the very first listen."
5,Really Great Read,"I really love the way this book breaks down a complicated application and gives me ways to use it in the ""real"" world. I get so tired of Photoshop books that promise to get me ""up and running"" and then proceed to show me things that are cool, but that no one would ever use. The author seems to understand how to the relate to the real world, and he's given me a lot of ideas on how I can use this application... I would recommend it to any beginners, intermediate users, or anyone just wanting to think outside the box."
5,"Great information, concise and to the point","This book was a requirement for a class that I took. Of all of the books we used for different topics, this was my favorite. It covers numerous topics, and does so in a ""short, sweet, and to the point"" manner. If you need lengthy explanations of topics, or are VERY new to any type of graphics program, this book may not be the best for you, as it covers an entire topic in a page or two. If you have experience or can catch on to new topics quickly and with ease, the book is perfect for you.Each topic has an explanation that tells you what you are about to do. There is a side bar that gives you numbered steps on how to complete the task, accompanied by actual pictures and screen shots with numbers that point to what to click on.Great book if dislike books that are lengthy in explanation and lack pictures. Perfect if you need a book to reference for topics only. Can also be very fast reading if you are trying to learn the software."
4,Great Guide,"Great service by Amazon to list such good titles for purchase through the website. The book was not only good, but the CD (which was supplied separately for a nominal postage charge), was really useful. Presentation is neat and Options in all Menus and sub-menus, clearly set out. Serves also as a good reference guide at any time.Higly recommended. I am sure that any person who buys this product will not regret the decision."
3,Works but better products out there.,This product seems to work and has for about one year. But the issue is you have to hold the button down for about 2-3 seconds to get the light to turn on. This is stated in the instructions but still very had to get used to. Try walking around your house and having to hold a button 3 seconds to get a light to turn on. Gets annoying. Reliablity does seem OK.
1,Failed,"It worked for a short while then failed. I returned it, got a refund minus the cost of shipping which cost me as much as the item. Bottom line...I lost money and time and cannot recommend this product. The company did as it said it would do but I still lost on this deal."
4,Fountain Switch,I required a remote switch for the recepticle for our garden fountain for water savings and also to control it at the times when it would be seen most.This does the job perfectly.
4,Dog fan,Very good episodes. They only thing that didn't make it 5 stars was the fact that it only has about eight episodes on it. I wish it had them all.
5,As real as it gets...,"This is an excellent series, because it is as close to real ""reality"" TV as you can get. Not only are they apprehending criminals, but they are sticking together as a family and trying to teach the people they catch a valuable lesson on life, which makes this series much more enveloping than other shows. Chapman is very brave in the fact that he doesn't use a gun to apprehend bail-jumpers. A class-act show that I thoroughly enjoy every time I watch it. I hope they bring out the entire season and eventually the series as it develops in the future."
4,3.5 stars but this thing doesn't do halves,"The author forcefully insists on the real passion between the women that she studies; this becomes to me repetitive and distracting. However, given the historical context of this book, in which a ""lesbian recovery"" of history was less accepted, I see the purpose of her tactics. In any case, the author draws together a wealth of evidence that makes for fascinating and provocative reading, even if she does lean a bit too much on literary examples as proof of what attitudes were ""really."" She makes a strong case, though. Recommended."
4,"Book was in very good condition, but the book itself....","I was very pleased with the order itself. It was packed well and shipped on time. That said, the actual book itself is a bit disappointing so far. It was described by others as delving into the minds of the characters, but so far (I'm only 1/4 of the way through the book) it isn't too descriptive in that regard. I'll definitely finish it though."
3,It was ok,"I thought that the hand that rocks the cradle was a well written book, may be it need just a little more work"
4,"I like this book, it's small and neat.","this book is very informative I like it, it is going to help me a lot in class, love it."
3,"complete book of curtain, slipcovers & upholstery","appears to be a good book, just doesn't cover the topic i was looking for. it would be nice if amazon allowed a space for the seller to enter exactly what a book, magazine or video covers."
2,OK WHAT THEY DOING WHEN THEY MIXED THIS ROCK !,YOU ONLY GET THE ONE SONG ON THIS CD PUSHING THE FEELING A HOT CLUB STOPPER SO IF YOU DONT HAVE THAT SONG AND CANT FIND IT ANYWERE ELE'S GO FOR IT BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO STAY WAY FROM THE ONE'S PUSHING MORE THAN JUST MIX'S DUH HA !
3,"Rad product, but disappointed with what I received","I purchased this case as a replacement for an identical one that had been stolen from my purse. It's cute and convenient for any time my contacts are bothering me or I stay away from home. And I obviously must like it a lot if I feel compelled to research and order a replacement online.My only complaint is that the case I received did not have the nice foam lining I was expecting - It had a flimsy plastic tray that popped out whenever I removed the solution bottles. I threw out the plastic tray and now everything rolls around loosely in the case, and the contact solution bottles leak if held upside down. I want to purchase a replacement for this disappointing case, as well as one to give as a gift to a friend, but am hesitant to do so for fear that I would again receive a cheesey plastic tray and leaky solution bottles.Good idea/product - I may have gotten a defective one."
2,contact case holder,"Great idea and fun color! Too big and very hard to get the pieces out, especially the actual contact holder."
4,Great Cookbook,"This book is a great collection of different soups for different moods. They also all incorporate several similar ingrediants, but stick to a great variety. My only complaint is the lack of calorie, fat, protein and carb counts. That would be helpful."
5,Great movie,"This is a fantastic movie, Ellen Barkin plays an abused mother who has to learn to deal with her demons (alcohol/loneliness) and as she is doing it it interferes with her ability to always have a loving relationship with her daughters. This movie makes you think about the choices that mothers in the 50's and before had compared to now. It's a beautiful story that is translated very well into this movie."
3,true@heart,Realized that this dvd is not formatted to normal dvd players. Should of looked at it before ordering it. I don't know on content so buyers beware.
5,Brilliant acting!,I remember watching this movie as a young adult and have always wanted to get it on DVD. I love sad movies and Before Women Had Wings is definitely one of those. Like most independent movies the acting is a few notches above most Hollywood types. I highly recommend this movie.
1,Lousy book,"What can I say? This is a dismal outing by Howard Chaykin who is capable of better. Doubly disappointing because it tries to recreate an affectionate cult team - the Challengers of the Unknown, who were tough derring-do dudes with chemistry. This new team and new story lacks any reason for us to identify with them. If you liked the old Challengers - you definitely should stay away. Even if you're just a regular comic book fan - I have one word: AVOID!"
5,Panasonic KX-FPG391 Fax/Copier with Cordless Phone,"This is my fourth fax-copier and telephone answering system. By far the easiest to use, smaller on the desktop, quality sound and printing. Highly recommended."
2,kxfpg391,"We bought this unit about a year ago and it seemed to work ok for the first few months. The telephone part of it works great. We don't recieve faxes to often so it's hard to tell when it went haywire but now the paper feeds in crooked so it can't complete the fax, so it stores it. Not a word in the book about how to recieve a stored fax. The onscreen notes say to check the ink and we do but it doesn't help. We've decided to throw it in the trash can and buy a Brother. The last Brother we owned worked perfectly. We thought upgrading to Panasonic would be nice. NOT"
1,terrible,bulky and cumbersome. needs new ribbons often which are pricey and inefficient. Poor signal quality with handheld. Threw it in the garbage.
5,Could not put it down!,"Probably one of the best pieces of motorcycle racing related fiction I've ever read. Extremely well written. Beyond easy to read. Read entire book in one day, i simply could not get away from it.The author truly makes you feel what it's like to try out racing for the first time. I could not help but grin every time the author would describe events and emotions that I've felt myself in the past, just like the author did.I'd recommend this book to any racer or track day enthusiast.Let your loved ones read this book, perhaps they might get a glimpse of what makes us so crazy about this sport!"
5,Makes you just wanna get out on the track!,"I found out about this book through the CCS and WERA bbs'. I bought it on a whim. True to their reviews it was a fun read, and did a pretty good job getting you into the action moment. I enjoyed the story involving the racing, and the crazy cast of characters you can meet racing, especially. I'd suggest anyone wanting to start club racing to buy this book. It will either scare you completely away, or set the hook for good!"
5,Better than a Classroom,"This DVD series is more informative and instructive than any classroom I've ever attended. Unfortunately I attended a terrible school and received little to no actual instruction.Thanks to Malinda I now understand the science and application of Alpha peels, Beta peels, and how to use them in conjunction with Microdermabrasion to achieve maximum, safe results. I also learned other gems of information such as the proper application of sunscreen...yes, there is a better way to apply it than just rubbing it on! There's no substitute for actually watching a live peel in action with an expert discussing the technique step by step.Yes, the series is a bit pricey, but in this case you get what you pay for. Malinda's years of experience and in-depth knowledge shine through. You will be more than compensated for your time and money."
4,English-Navajo book about Navajo life in Autumn,"This is a great little book for learning Navajo. Along with illustrations of 'traditional' Navajo doing traditional activities such as weaving, dyeing, and spinning, there are dual-language narratives on common autumn activities. In the voice of a Navajo child, we hear about living in a hogan, watching animals, turning wool into woven products, and silversmithing. Good for reading aloud to both English- and Navajo-speaking children."
3,"Good, but lacks energy","by now, the academy (is...) has become everyone's favorite band. it's not hard to figure out why either; their sound is similar (simlar, not 'the same', dips**ts) to fall out boy, and they're pretty catchy too. but ""almost here"" seems to suffer from a lack of energy. With the exception of ""checkmarks"", ""attention"" and ""almost here, the songs seem slightly repetitive and flat, lacking that get up and go punch other chi bands have. Your can't really call this pop-punk, it's more like pop, but even still, it's pretty boring. Also, replay value is low. The first few times i heard it, i liked it. After that, i couldn't get past the first 4 or 5 tracks. There is MUCH MUCH better out there, and i'd suggestion checking out 'the audition' or 'june' if you want more dance-rock style music. Good overall, but lacks a much needed energy."
5,Fantastic,"Although this band has a few albums out, this one is by far their best and most original work. After seeing them live I notice still that songs from this album hold a certain nostalgia in my heart. This album is original, innovative, and the lead singer's voice is utterly unique. I highly recommend this album, but if you like it like I do, be cautious their later work does not have the same style."
3,Decent but nothing special,"A good band with potential, but nothing that grabs your attention compared to newer music. Great first round but bored the next."
2,Doing the same thing as all the other pop punk bands... just not as well.,"With mediocre (at best)lyrics, and rather flat (and monotonous at times) vocals, I can't say this is the best CD I've ever heard but it's not the absolute worst either. There's just not enough substance for it to hold my attention. I couldn't even listen to one song the whole way through. It's just kinda blah."
1,"Wow, The best album in the whole entire world!!! This is better than the beatles.","Lyrically, this is the best album ever! Bob Dylan doesn't compete with this. And they rock crazier than the Rolling Stones. Oh, and did I say they were incredibly original. Oh, and the lyrics are so deep. They sing about things that no one else sings about like girls and relationships and stuff. I mean like everything. Originality should be the bands name. No one in the whole entire world sounds like them. Oh, I need to tell my mom to buy it for me again because I keep giving all the copies away that I have.This is definitely worth the money to buy it for yourself and five copies for your mother... were they on the cover of the rolling stone magazine yet?"
1,Live Performances Always Show Potential!,"With that, I must say this band has none.. whatsoever. It was horrible to hear the front man wail off key to a bunch of swooning girls, with half assed smiles on their faces, knowing all to well that the performance has nothing to offer other than the cute guy from the video, or the professionally polished, studio production Cd. However the band was good, well timed and had a lot of great enthusiasm, dispite the lead singer, but it didn't go farther than me wanting to revolt and stop listening. I can't handle music being pawned off like this anymore."
3,so....so,this cd is not bad. but it is not that pleasingly great either. its one of those cd's that you'll listen to for a while and forget they ever excisted.this is only there first so ill give them credit for how goos this is for theve not not been around that long.
1,Backstreet EMO,"Its terrible sounding stuff. I love Silverstein, Hawthorne Heights, The Killers, and Bayside but this band sounds like the Backstreet Boys on something worse than EMO. Do yourself a favor and pass this one over.Terrible"
1,NOT REAL PUNK,"this is not real punk. real punk is sex pistols, ramones, black flag or even nofx. there is no political statements here, no rebelion, just a bunch of wussies who wear make-up and sing about girls. the academy is, good charlotte and sum 41 are NOT punk. i would even buy a green day record first. If you want to like this crap, then fine, but dont call it punk or even pop-punk."
5,wow!!! incredible!,"I have been waiting for a great cd to come along for a long time now. I bought this cd a week ago with pretty high expectations, but I had no idea just how good it was going to be. There isn't an average song on the album, and they're the type of songs that just get you hooked right away. I have a feeling The Academy Is... is gonna be big, and I recommend you go out and buy this cd...RIGHT NOW. It's amazing. The great cd ive been waiting for is here...almost here. :-)"
3,"Yes, I think this album Is worth buying","Its a good album, Its not the best album but i enjoy listening to it. Theres something unique about William becketts voicals, they dont sound like some typical emo bands that are out there. i guess you have to give them a chance because they are just starting out but i cant wait to see what the next ablum sounds like. songs that i like are almost here, attention, seasions, skeptics and true believers. I love the song checkmarks, its the best song on the ablum."
3,Memories of the land where my hubby grew up.,"Going back quite aways, and having a great time remembering OLD Lake Placid. It was not always ""Heaven"", but during the depression, it was a great place to grow up!"
1,one star is still to much,"I normally don't write reviews (maybe a good day to start) but with this so called DOCUMENTARY - I simply have to.Don't waste your money - NO - not even $1.99 - not even a dime - you find better information on YouTube in a 12 second clip, better acting in a kindergarten Orson Wells play, you know more about Tombstone BEFORE you watch this miserable made, acted, put together video.My nieces and nephews (age 3 -11) can put a better video up with their Barbie camera. Worst quality - horrible sound - if I would know more cool swear words I would come up with them right now for the miserable acting and don't let me start with the script - storyboard or whatever you want to call this pile of horse manure that is not even worth a C- for a 5th grader.Be smart - save your money - if you don't - don't say I didn't warn you"
1,There's nothing new about Silence.,"Aesthetic theory as an ontologized by Clair recasts work that has been done in different disciplines for hundreds of years. There is nothing new about the content of the book or the way in which it is written. Import-heavy, poor in possibilities, quick to be politically correct- this is communication studies at its very worst."
2,Reflections of Rosemary,This is not what I expected; Debbie Boone's voice is so very different from Rosemary Clooney's that the connection between the two was a poor one.
5,Debby Boone is back!,"Long-awaited return to the music scene for Debby Boone! This CD is excellent! Great songs, great musicians, and Debby's flawless vocals make this a must for fans of Ms. Boone or her mother-in- law, Rosemary Clooney, to whom this album is affectionately dedicated. I can't wait for another album from Debby.-Jacob"
2,"Ho, hum","I could not wait to get this record. Debby Boone has one of the purest singing voices in the business -- top of the line. But why is this record so bland and blase? Debby even inherited all of Rosemary's musical arrangements (Rosemary being her mother-in-law), so what happened? Even Debby's voice is restrained. I was disappointed. Debby looks fabulous for being almost 50 years old (and check out the photo of her four adult children with Gabriel Ferrer). Sorry, folks, if you want a real tribute and a dynamite recording of Rosemary Clooney covers, you MUST buy Bette Midler's ""Rosemary Clooney's Songbook."" That one is so great that we bought two copies -- one for my wife, and one for me! Sorry, Debs -- Two stars is the most I can do. If you decide to put out Vol. II, CUT LOOSE and let's hear that voice and some arrangements that Rosemary would swing to!"
4,Beware of Boys: a Winner,"It all starts when one small boy takes a shortcut through the woods(not usually a smart thing to do). He is, of course, captured by a mean and hungry wolf who takes the boy back to his cave. The boy soon convinces the wolf that it would be far better to cook the boy in some elaborate recipe than to eat him raw. Children can soon see where this story is heading and figure that the boy will somehow outsmart the wolf. When I picked this book for storytime at my elementary school I thought it might be a little long for short attention spans. However, from the reading of the title to the very end the children were really interested. The colorful pictures helped. I also liked the way the author wrote out the recipes for ""Boy Soup,"" ""Boy Pie"" and ""Boy Cake."" It adds an extra touch of humor and uniqueness to the story. I recommend it highly."
1,Not so pleased,The book was in much worse shape than I expected. The binding is totally shot and several of the pages are torn.
3,a so so book,"Its material is not far from what is covered in introductory accounting textbook, i.e. not much.Buy it if you had never took a course in accounting before, and if you took a course before, do not buy it.Its width/depth can't compare w/ college financial statement textbook and cashflow textbook."
2,Mediocre Book,This book is poorly written and way too elementary to provide any useful analysis of financial statements. You're better off reading something on the internet.
5,"I haven't had better sex, with out listening to this.","If you really whant to inpres a girl the first time you do it you should pay this cd. Is ambiental, and gets in the rythm of sex. get it is like doig it in a high quality Porno movie."
5,THE BEST,"This album contains some of the best music I have ever laidears on. I have never heard anything like this before. In theaftermath of listening to this I discovered that not only was Ireally experiencing something new, I was becoming someone new.Moreover, this is just some great music and it truly surprisesyou once you start to listen.Although no words can describe this artist I would definitlysay that they are cosmic, novel, crazy, and very hard to find.So if you want to broaden your musical horizons, then pick thisherald to the coming of a new age of music. You won't ever wantor need another album, after this. You'll never take it out orleave it behind. Trust me this is the greatest album that hasever been made!"
5,If I was a woman...,"I'd want to be Nico. She's one of a kind. But I don't know if I'd be willing to go through all the addictions, depressions, and holocausts to get to that point. Plus, I think men are yucky. Yes, if I were Nico, I'd be a lesbian."
5,water bottle,the bottle preformed perfectly while i was in the mountains of Kenya in the Kisii valley
2,Katadyn Extream XR Water Purifier,"Although this was easy to assemble, the spout on the bottle does not disperse water very well. The hole is too small and a great deal of water spurts out the sides (which is not going through the filter so it is impure water getting into the cup). Also, the little holes on the lid are confusing as to their purpose. I used this on an overseas trip and will probably never use again as it did not effectively purify the water and was quite frustrating to use."
1,YUCK!!!! The water tastes like iodine!!,"If you like your water to taste like iodine, this purifier is for you. If my life actually depended on it, obviously I would drink water from this bottle. Otherwise forget it."
5,Works for me,A wonderful devise for backpacking or a long day of river fishing. Light easy to use and as long as there ie water around your in good shape. Great for back country camping.
2,Not very sturdy- short term interest in toy,"It's small size probably prevents the toy from being built as sturdily as the larger See 'n Say type toys. It didn't last very long, and offered only limited entertainment. But even after broken, my granddaughter still carried it with her for awhile because it had Dora on it."
4,"Good condition, and very timely arrival","This product was in great condition, and it was sent to me in a timely manner. Thanks."
2,Disappointing,"This is a disappointing book that does not live up to the expectations that the author lays out. It's humdrum, drab, and dull."
2,BORING!,This was one of the most boring books I have read in a long time. Lot's of math - word problems & equations. I suppose if you are into this sort of thing you may find this book somewhat interesting but it is not a book one would read for enjoyment. I had to read it as part of a college course and it was terrible! If you must use it I suggest checking it out from a library - it's not worth the price (no matter what the asking).
3,"Good Stuff, If You Want to Plow Through It","Like a good tool kit, this book has a tool for almost every situation. In a nutshell, the message here is that before you make any decisions -- tough or easy -- you need to give a lot of thought to how you're going to give it a lot of thought. In other words, you need to ""structure"" your thinking to get the best result(s), and the author gives you 14 ""powerful"" techniques for doing so. There's a lot of good stuff in this book. Unfortunately, some of it's very simple and readable while the rest is complex and turgid. I can see this book being handed out at a management training seminar. But it's far too weighty for most of the decisions you'll make in a day. Glad I read it, but I probably won't use most of the techniques in my daily life."
4,Solid decision making made easy,"Enjoyed the book immensely. Here, in amongst much 'release your genius' type stuff is something a little less salesmanship (on offer is just a toolkit and not the possibility of 'unleashing' your latent 'genius') and a good deal more of useable material.In a business context the ability to establish a framework might not, at first, seem to be something missing - but after sitting through too many meetings where the criteria for establishing a decision is not known the ability to pick one of the tools from this book and get everyone thinking through the same process is worth more than the price alone. Less angst, better decisions."
4,nothing new but good solid trash,"If u like Agent Orange and Better off Dead, you can buy this one and like it too. They have become a little repetitive but I'll still give it 4 stars just for keeping the 80's trash spirit alive."
5,Beautiful bathroom faucet!,"I needed a new bathroom faucet, and looked at many places online. The Danze Plymouth Double-Handled faucet in polished brass looked very nice online, and I was happy Amazon had one of the best prices, so I ordered it. When it came I was extremely pleased with how it looked. My husband installed it that day with absolutely no problems, and it looks fantastic in my bathroom. I love it!!"
3,"Oh, My, GOD... Spock!","This album is either 1 star or 5 stars depending on the level of illegal pharmaceuticals in your system or the number of starfleet uniforms you have in the closet. It's better than Shatner's album at least. The ""If I Were A Carpenter"" track became sort of an inside joke when I was in college.Avoid it, or not."
3,not for everyone,"I have the original album, ""The Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy"". This is that material plus the outtakes. After hearing you can see why outtakes. Proud Mary with Brooklyn-ish accent on ""turnin' and burnin'. Good to have if your a big trek fan, Lord knows you probably spent more on some other trek junk. I always like the album and the cd gave me a better copy,,,great album no,,,,great fun yes."
5,Fits KitchenAid KCM223CU0,"I didn't see my coffee maker model number listed in the item description, but this does fit the KitchenAid Coffeemaker model number KCM223CU0.This filter is easy to use and easy to clean."
4,Must-have for MKA fans..,"If you don't like the Olsen twins, I advise you not to buy this CD, 'cuz they sing all of the songs. A lot of the songs are sung by the Olsens when they were really young. But there are a couple bonus songs from their School Dance Party video! I liked the CD. If you liked their first Greatest Hits, you'll like this one!!"
4,Worth the money!,"I purchased this coffee pot after my mom recommended it to me. I couldn't believe you could get an $... coffee pot for $.... It is a great coffee pot. The pot itself is larger than any other pot I have had. It is really nice to have the 1-4 cup button, it really does make a good cup of coffee when you use the button. I like that it shuts off after two hours and that it is programmable. This coffee pot is well worth the money!"
2,looks good but smells bad,coffee had a funny taste.......needed to flush out maker many times before smell went away......
4,Great Coffee for the price,"I just bought this machine a week ago and I just can't stop making coffee all the time. I love the timer, because I wake up and the first thing I smell is fresh coffee, if you aren't a morning person this is the coffee maker for you. This is my first Cuisinart product and I promise you it won't be the last one."
1,Another junk coffee maker to add to your growing list...,"I have never bought a factory re-conditioned anything...I took a chance on this. Two months later it leaks like crazy during the brew cycle. Of course in order to get warranty service it will cost you another $10, plus the s/h, yeah right. My list of junk coffee makers has another addition, Cusinart. I fully expected this brand to be well made and now my opinion is quite different. I wish I would have known that Conair is the parent company as I find their products to be inferior. Thankfully I have a great standby...the FRENCH PRESS. Never had a problem with it. Take the money they are asking for this and spend it on a GOOD brand..."
4,Diggin at the Tramps,"Perhaps the greatest unit of producers and emcees ever put together, this is a dope ride through its members solo joints live. Classics from the likes of Diamond D, Lord Finess, and Show & AG are all represented lovely. Not usually a fan of live CD's, this one has good production value and has a very energetic vibe often missing in the studio."
4,oldies but goodies,authentic styling and voices. Cole Porter as written and played on Broadway. It's a look into the past that is still relevant. I'm happy I have it.
1,This poorly written novel should not have been published.,"I purchased this book after hearing a breathlessly enthusiatic review on NPR. I wasted my money. Worse yet, I wasted my time reading a poorly written fictional story about Treblinka when I could have read a chilling nonfictional account of the camp. The characters are thinnly-drawn. And the author imbues characters with traits that the characters are not likely to have possessed. (The hero, a young man who does not appear well-educated, spins fantasies about the lives of gas-chamber victims as he performs his ""dentistry"" upon them. The fantasies appear to be beyond the possible realm of the hero's imagination.) The prose is repetative in many sections. And some sex scenes, particularly between one officer, Voss, and his wife, are gratuitous."
2,Not a tight fit,"This filter is much better than the foam type, but not as good as the original. The plastic frame does not fit tightly against the vacuum, and the air smells dusty every time I turn it on. A filter made by HONEYWELL #H13002 is great! I found it at Menard's, made by Home Care Filter Products Inc."
2,Not the right filter for my vacuum.,"I have a Self Propelled WindTunnel Upright, but this filter does not fit with my machine. It's going in our donate bag. Maybe someone else will be able to use it."
5,The right filter is great if you get it!,"The Hoover 40120101 HEPA Final fits my Hoover Wind Tunnel vacuums -2 different models, and it does not leak air around it even though there is no gasket. It arrived in a Hoover box and had Hoover 40120101 embossed in the black plastic on top. I use HEPA bags with the HEPA final filter as I am vacuuming up wood dust that can cause allergic reactions and have had no problems.I placed a second order for 3, this time with B & M Housewares and was unhappy to find my order arrive without an invoice, the filters without boxes or labels or protection from damage, and obviously NOT what I ordered. I suspect they are a non-Hoover 1 micron/activated charcoal final filter. I am sending them back - it seems fishy to send no invoice/no boxes - almost like someone was hoping I would not notice that I had been sent $5 filters and not the $14 filters I ordered. Be careful whom you buy these from!"
5,Hoover Filter,This filter fits my vacuum exactly. It is the same as the one that I used before. Works great
4,Pretty Swell Knife,This Kuhkuri knife is pretty solid and cuts very well. My only complaint would be that the plastic handle feels kind of cheap. It's a beauiful (and cheap) addition to a knife collection otherwise.
1,not sealed,every single bar is only sealed on one side...the other side was left unsealed so the bars may not even be safe to eat...but i ate a two before i noticed the problem and they tasted ok and i am not dead yet. i took the rest out of the box and one side is open on every bar.
1,Duplicate Product,This is not the same product you buy from stores. Very Bad Taste had to just throw it in the garbage. Please do not buy. Did not expect to get this kind of service from Amazon.
4,A truly superb debut album,"I don't know much about the artist Andreas Johnson but I do know that I love his music. His vocals almost reminds me a bit of Bob Dylan and David Gray combined. There is such a earnest, sincerity in his lyrics that just takes the listener's breath away like in songs such as ""Patiently"" nad ""The Games We Play"". Just one listen to ""Glorious"" was all it took for me to fall in love with this talented Swedish artist. ""Glorious"" is a infectious electronica-influenced pop/rock song with a melody that cannot be duplicated by any other artist. I am not too crazy about ""People"" and ""Spaceless"" but I can easily forgive him for those songs with ""Patiently"", ""Glorious"", and ""The Games We Play"". I definitely look forward to hearing more from Andreas Johnson in the future."
5,The Eighth Wonder From Sweden,"This album is the best thing I've never heard, singer's voice is incredible,all songs are perfect.It's a pity only that that artist is unknown here in the States, but with that voice I can predict a glorious future for this young boy."
4,Almost perfect,"I say almost perfect because there is one tune that irks me a little. Other than that this CD was exactly what I was hoping for when I had previously heard the song glorious elsewhere. Glorious is just the type of song that makes a person want to have the whole album and not worry about the quality of the rest. Because of Glorious, you trust that is has to be good. And it certainly is. There is a constant liebling-esque strain that flows throughout the entire album, tying the songs together and creating a flow between them that makes for a lovely transition from one catchy tune to the next. A good album for de-stressing."
2,Fell Apart,"This hamper looks nice and holds a lot of laundry. The problem is that it fell apart very quickly. The inside cloth bags all tore at the seams within 8 months. Also, the wicker outside is flimsy and the basket didn't hold its shape very well. We used ours for 2 years, despite the wear, and are now having to throw it out. If you purchase this item, don't expect it to hold up!"
3,"I expected more, but overall, not bad","The first one that arrived was damaged. I was VERY impressed with the ease and speed of the replacement that Amazon offered. The second one was also damaged, but not to the extent of the first one. One of the legs was slightly bent on the second one. I realize seagrass is a ""casual"" material, but there were a lot more frayed pieces and loose ends than I expected. I was a bit disappointed that the laundry bags can't be lifted out individually - they are connected to each other. You should also know there is no bottom in the unit. The bottom of the laundry bags rest on the floor. Casters are included if you want to use them, but due to the bags resting on floor, I don't feel that rolling the sorter around with the bags dragging on the floor would be a good idea. The size of the bags for our 2 person household is adequate."
4,Good product for the price,The item was very easy to setup. The only problem I had was with the velcro that holds the laundry bags in place. The problem was getting the velcro to line up properly. There is a slight grass like smell to it but it isn't strong. I understand the comments about sturdiness. I believe the frame could have been made a little sturdier but if it isn't abused there shouldn't be any problems.
3,"very nice looking, but broke after 6 months of use","very nice looking, but broke after 6 months of use. I was able to repair the broken metal frame with some aluminum rods and zips ties."
5,laundry sorter,Whitney Design ML-6445 Woven-Seagrass Triple Laundry Sorter with Casters and 3 RemovableI'm very pleased this this product
1,Why sell this item?,"I can not bekieve this item would even be on Amazon. It is cheap, very flimsy, and not worth the cost to ship."
1,Damaged,I ordered this product and it came in damaged twice!! Stay away from this product and amazon for not making sure it wasn't damaged the 2nd time around..
3,Good laundry sorter,"This is good for sorting laundry, especially if you're single or a small family. An extra large load in our washer is 1 1/2 of the sections, as opposed to just 1. It's made of seagrass and the odor was so obnoxious, like being in a barn full of hay, I'm afraid it would make allergic individuals sneeze constantly. I even sat it outside in full sun with no change in the odor. I used polyurethane on it to stop the stink. It also couldn't handle much abuse either. As it folds flat, I tied some jute strings to the bottom of the frame to help reinforce it. It doesn't take up much space and with it closed I even have a small workspace."
1,Wow. Amazon really sells this junk?,"Same as other bad reviews: Pricey yet cheaply made. One foot snapped off at end, so couldn't even use the regular feet. I have a brick propping it up. Read the reviews on Target.com of this piece of carp: Target stopped carrying it because of all the complaints. Do not kid yourself: the picture looks nice but it's cheap and won't last, assuming it even arrives intact. There's no quality control here."
3,Good but not great,I got this at bed bath and beyond. I loved the look of this item and the triple sorter vs double or quad. The material of the outside is nice. But the unit itself is somewhat flimsy. Especially when moving it around. It doesn't keep its rectangular form and becomes a rhombus for lack of a better description. There is a piece that is supposed to keep the bottom secure and in place but it doesn't work. As another reviewer stated you can't just remove one bag without removing them all. Nice but not for what it costs.
5,Love it!,"Helps to clean up my laundry room and looks great too! Fills up quickly though, probably not great for a family larger then 3-4"
1,VERY POOR QUALITY!,For what this cost the quality is terrible! I couldn't even put it together because 2 pieces were missing and one of the laundry bags has a hole in it:( disappointing to say the least!
4,2nd one we received was good,"I like this product (good size, functions well, rustic but good looking (only minor complaint would be that the bags easily come unhooked from the frame when clothes are removed, but they're easily re-attached) - much better than the mismatched hampers we had before), but we had to return the first one we got due to a broken wheel that kept falling off during the first use. The replacement item was scheduled to arrive in 6 days and actually arrived the very next day - that was a nice surprise!I selected a UPS pickup and unfortunately, they came at the same time each day,while my husband and I were at work. However, Amazon customer service was able to reschedule another pickup attempt for us, and this time, UPS got it on the first try. We are very happy now!"
4,Only 1 Complaint,The product itself is great; the included bags are terrible and really cheap quality. I've going to have to sew my own bags - the ones included are poorly made and frayed when arrived.
2,Great looking but NOT STURDY!,This is a very pretty laundry sorter that looks great in any room of the house and blends in with any decor/color walls. It was super easy to assemble. Took me all of 5 minutes. The only complaint I have is that the whole set-up is very flimsy and bands and gold with the slightest pressure. For instance pushing the sorter over to the laundry room is an effort as I'm always worried the whole thing is going to collapse. It's not sturdy at all.
3,$75? Not worth it.,"I got the package and the box was bent in half. I thought... well, maybe I need to put the pieces together and no damage was done. This was mostly assembled, and yes, the frame was bent so bad that I needed to tie it together. Poor packaging? Poor delivery company? I don't know. This also did not seem worth it's $75. $40 maybe even $50, but NOT $75. It was smaller than I anticipated. The weave didn't seem secure. The frame was weak. I bought this because I didn't want to buy (or support) a plastic one for $15... they seem about the same quality.On a positive note... I like that it ""hides"" laundry. It smells nice... like sweet grass. It makes the laundry room look clean and tidy."
2,caster leg breaks,The hamper is nice and service was quite good. The first one had a broken leg when it arrived and had to be returned. The new one was fine but there is a pin fastened to each of the legs. To attach casters you have to remove a plastic foot. I was able to do this on three of them but the fourth was bent and came off. So we have three legged hamper. Will probably send it back as well. Can't recommend. Noticed some others have this problem as well. So if you are looking for something without wheels (as in the product picture) it may be ok. If you want the casters on be real careful with setup as they appear soldered not welded.
2,"Looks nice, but the bags aren't any good.","I've had this sorter for 2 years or so and the seams on the bags have come undone. It still looks nice on the outside, but I will have to replace it soon or make me some new bags. I don't like how the bags are fastened at the top, either. They have velcro strips across the top that fastens to the hanger. The middle hanger holds both bags on either side so if you want to remove the bag, you have to undo the velcro strips in the middle and then re-fasten them. My hamper is a short distance from my washing machine and I have found this to be a huge inconvience. Personally, I wish I would have kept looking. However, if your laundry sorter is next to your washing machine, I'm sure this will work for you. At least until you have to sew the bags together again!"
3,Attractive and Functional but the odor .............,"I ordered this because it seemed attractive and functional. I'm in an apartment and don't like laundry to be visible.It is in my bedroom and for appearances, it blends well. Yes the bags have strings but - who cares? I'm not looking inside it. I have noticed other reviews that mention it's not sturdy. It's a laundry basket not a bench. As a laundry basket it works very well.I didn't put the casters on it. I didn't want to mess with them and won't be rolling it around.It is very easy to put together and does look just as it does in the picture.My only complaint so far is the smell. It has been in my house a couple weeks and it smells like a bale of hay. I expected the smell to fade but so far it hasn't.If I can't get rid of the odor I'll have to get rid of the hamper. It has my allergies on overload.I would have given it a higher rating but for me the odor is so bad that I almost gave it only 2 stars."
2,Install Casters?!,"I wanted to install the casters and the instructions state ""If you want to install the caster, pls.take out the rubber at the bottom feet first."" I have tried pulling, turning, yanking w/pliers and the bloody rubber does not come off of the feet. The only way I'm going to get the casters on is to destroy this crap product.Back to the store you go!"
3,Not Bad,"The exterior is nice but the bags are hard to get in and out. The velcro is very strong, will need to offload the laundry into a basket instead of just pulling out each bag."
4,"Works great, looks nice, easy to assemble","I just got this laundry sorter in the mail yesterday. It was a breeze to put together - only took 10 minutes from box to ready to use. I have not noticed any sort of grassy smell as another reviewer commented. It does seem a little flimsy, but as long as I don't move it around, I think it will work fine. It holds a lot in each of the little compartments. In my ""wash on hot"" bin I put 2 queen sized duvet covers, several pillow shams and still had room for a couple of bath towels and kitchen towels. It really looks nice and has made the laundry corner much more organized and presentable. Overall, I think it is a great purchase for the price."
1,Total trash,"DO NOT buy this product. It came in a flimsy bent box and bent several of the pieces inside. In order to remove the rubber feet to install the casters, you must destroy the rubber feet. Then you find that the casters don't rotate. In addition, every time you disturb the cross pieces holding the laundry bags, the pieces come out of their useless little holders. The cloth bags have so many untrimmed strings that the strings hang out of the bottom and are totally unsightly. I would send this back if the box was in any condition to be reused. I wouldn't re-order anyway, because I would probably get the same piece of trash."
4,Great Experience,"It's perfect for our two person family. It is sturdy enough as long as you do not overfill its normal capacity. We especially like the three dividers to keep our laundry separated into whites, colors and towels. I would recommend a one foot taller unit for larger families, so as not to overstuff and possibly damage the unit.Ronald BalutDes Plaines, Illinois"
5,Great pictures,"This is a wonderful collection of photographs of North Carolina. The section on Scenes has some stunning scenes from the coast to the mountains. The People and Events Section shows North Carolinians and visitors who are notable in fields ranging from politics to the arts. The Sports section shows football, basketball, golf, baseball and even Highland games. North Carolina has them all.AA great addition to your library if you're interested in the Old North State."
2,worked for only one month,"This phone looks good but worked for only one month. After that, it was really noisy and can't be acceptable.I have to look for another phone to replace it."
2,worked only for one month,"this phone looks not bad and worked well in the first month,but after one month it was really noisy that can't be acceptable.now i have to look for another phone to replace it."
3,From Back Cover,"She came home with a plan ...Rachel Dean had arranged to make a very sexy statement at her upcoming ten-year reunion! Once the wallflower of her small Texas town, the savvy New York lawyer was determined to get even with the jocks who'd made her teenage years hell. Her scheme: to make them want her--then leave them lusting! And her plan almost worked ......then seduced the wrong man!Garrett MacLean couldn't resist the sultry seductress, even though he knew she had him confused with his brother Carl. Still, with the way she revved his libido, he'd have done just about anything to have her ... But the next morning, Garrett knew that one spectacular night wasn't enough. He wanted Rachel in his bed--and his life--for good. Only Rachel still had others to seduce..."
1,"Below 1 star, don't waste your time!!",$1.99 for 45 minutes of terrible acting and an obtuse plot!!Glad I did no fall prey to the 10 bucks!!
2,Interesting...,"As a ""Phantom of the Opera"" fan, I'm always looking for movies with a ""Phantom"" theme. When I saw the title, ""Angel of Music,"" I was intrigued, since the Phantom is referred as the ""angel of music."" The description mentioned that it would make you rethink Lerouxs's romantic story, so I knew I had to see it. But after I watched it, I was disappointed.Even though it did make numerous references to the story, I didn't care much for the storyline involving a mysterious cult linked to the novel. The actual ""Phantom"" scenes were OK, but it was like watching a school production. The acting and action (or lack of) was corny.This version might be better off hiding underneath the Paris opera house or destroyed by a falling chandelier..."
1,Not Even Worth the One Star,Movies just don't get any worse than this.I had to give it at least one star but it doesn't even deserve that. The only way you will ever get through film is to watch the review made by the Phantom Reviewer- he at least made it good for a few laughs and it wasn't meant to be a comedy.
1,Phantom of the Opera and the DaVinci Code in an incoherent and amateurish mash up,"This is an amateur effort that frankly misses on all levels ... the acting is poor, but then it might not be their fault since the script is utterly incoherent. Neither characters nor even the plot are developed. MAYBE there is a kernel of a concept here, but despite the obviously earnest and sincere efforts of all involved, it is a total failure on all levels."
5,"Accurately points our errors, inconsistencies & contradictio",Terry Cain fearlessly tells it like it is. First the Bible is two books and two religions. The Bible is written over millenia by many fallible people. The New Testament contradicts the old. The Bible is filled with myths and inconsistencies.
5,Opal yourself!,"True NIN fans would get this for their collection, mainly because the first two songs are on the US version of it. Thankfully, he chose the best two to put on the import version, along with a all new, awesome, dark remix of HLAH. This may remind you even of a Meat Beat Manifesto song, but without a doubt, it's a excellent cd for a NINie to own."
5,Worth the money!,"I'm a pseudo-collector when it comes to Trent Reznor's work. I'll grab both the domestic and import versions of singles, like this one and the 'Sin' disc, but I'm not going to shell out forty bucks for the Japanese version of 'The Downward Spiral,' or a bunch more for the two disc version of 'Broken.' That said, let me say that even aside from its worth to collectors, the UK edition of 'Head Like a Hole' is worth the money. For one, it gets rid of all the filler mixes and misplaced ""Down In It"" and ""Terrible Lie"" versions that the US edition boasts. And for two, it gives us the best remix of ""Head Like a Hole"": the opal mix. I waited years to buy this one, and I'm kicking myself for it now... because ""Head Like a Hole (Opal)"" beats the living snot out of every other remix that one can find on the domestic edition of this disc. Only three tracks, yes... but they are the only essential versions of ""Head Like a Hole"" in my opinion. Five stars for good abridgement."
2,pay-back,"I just didn't care about this family drama. The Woodman's are a couple who inflict there obsessive urge to be creative on us. There may be a modicum of taste and technique but we live in an age where all amateurs want to be players judging by their ridiculous price-tags and profusion. Mrs Woodman's art sells precisely because it looks like anyone might be able to do it and to the non-amateur alike.Francessca their daughter- had more talent than her parents because she was being coached and encouraged "" to be an artist "" since the day she was born. If she had less angst about being famous she would not have committed suicide. It's that simple.Real artists create for their own pleasure and meaningfulness ; process AS important as result And don't kill themselves if not admired. That she did was due to her mother's inherant and superficial egotisms as an artist. Though God knows as a mother it was the last of her intentions."
4,Children will Love It!,In this book for children three and older the story of Noah and the Ark is told as if it happened to Little Hamster. Each time he takes a peek and then scurries back to his nest.
4,Parent Perspective,This book was recommended to me by my son's OT. I was disappointed that it is essentially a 17 page pamphlet. Although it was a great OVERVIEW of the program...I consider the cost to information ratio excessive and I wish I had gotten it out of the library.
4,Avery 3379 Note cards,"Cards were easy to use, after alignment was set properly. Images were crisp and sharp on finished product. When separated there were no ragged edges. Love them and would recommend them for homemade cards that look professionally made."
2,"Thin, flimsy card stock","I've tested many ink jet cards since I make and sell my own greeting cards.Avery used to have a great product almost ten years ago- a print to the edge glossy greeting card. Loved them, but for some reason they discontinued it.I wanted to try these but was disappointed to learn, after I bought them at Staples, that they are not a typical card stock weight, but more like perforated paper. Also, because they're perforated it does leave a rough edge after you separate the cards. It would be nice if they could make these with the same non-perforated edges used for their clean edge business cards (which I love.)If you want note cards for personal use and you don't mind the less than ""real"" card quality, these will probably work for you. If you want a professional presentation of your art or photography I recommend going with a heavier card stock that doesn't have perforated edges."
4,Nice paper,"These notecards have nice texture and color that print attractive cards. The drawback is the lack of templates and page setups for my verson of Microsoft Publisher (2003). I create original designs with Publisher. To print on these notecards, I have to go through a tedious process to transfer the images to Word, which does work with this Avery product. Microsoft Publisher is a popular software for making greeting cards and note paper, and Avery is a popular brand of blank papers. They should work together. Maybe this has been corrected with a later version of Publisher. Also sometimes the envelopes do not seal well. But I like the cards enough to put up with their shortcomings."
1,not what I was looking for,"This paper, despite its name, is not heavyweight at all. It's very thin and when using an Epson Stylus Pro 4900, it wraps slightly under the weight of the ink even when using the best setting for this type of paper. Slightly, because it's not out of control, but enough that the end product is not clean enough to be presentable.The templates for this product are only available for Microsoft Word and Apple Pages. No photoshop, or any other Adobe products.I now hope to be able to use it for collages, but afraid that the glue and matte medium will prove too much for it."
4,"A good, dependable way to produce greeting cards on an inkjet printer","While I'd like to see Avery or someone else come up with a more elegant paper stock for making greeting cards at home, this certainly gets the basic job done. Certainly well worth the cost."
2,Too cumbersome - will not use again.,"Too cumbersome - will not use again. It is difficult to figure out the positioning of the content to match the folds of the card. Not much, if any, assistance on this from Avery. Also, once folded, the card is very thick and heavy. In my opinion, the one, or two-card format sheets are much better."
4,Avery Card Stock,"My order of the 3379 Avery Note Cards was smooth and easy, the product was reasonbly priced and I only had one or two of the sheets bent up due to shipping or boxing. I have found the these cards for less else where on the net and now have been using that source.I believe Amazon handle my purchase very well and made it an effortless endeavor.tdhsr"
5,Extremely interesting and captivating,"I can claim this is the best christian game in the market.The background sound is incredible.You feel the stress and the scare when find demons but, at the same time, feel the peace that you can defeat them, using the power of the Lord.Very nice graphics, high 3D resolution, transparencies, beauty shinning lights of Lord's angel.I give this game a Top Notch!"
2,More plastic than stainless steel.,"Functions well enough but I was disappointed when I opened the box as it really just looks like plastic, the image displayed is somewhat deceiving and the key words to pay attention to in the description are ""stainless steel shell"". There are much nicer ice buckets out there for a little bit more money."
1,"Cheaply made bucket, hard to take lid off.","I was so disappointed because I love this company. But when I got it it was a thinly silver coated plastic with a lid that was very difficult to remove (just a thin stick in the center). It holds a few ice cubes, but not enough to make this a item worth buying. Might as well just walk over to the freezer."
1,Worthless bucket,"Cheap plastic, holds about 7 ice cubes, ugly and most of all the ice melts quickly. Don't buy it."
1,I'd prefer the sound of squealing pigs,"This is someone's sick joke. The singing christmas dogs would have done a better job on this album. While listening to it, I got an idea of what POWs went through in torture chambers. This CD should come with a bottle of valium.My recomendation......the whole bottle"
4,Sound data and dramatic narrative,"Leiby's book draws on a range of primary sources and concentrates on the Hackensack River Valley in New Jersey (extending up to Rockland County, NY). Few modern books go into as much detail for this region as does Leiby. His documentation is sound and he uses it to construct a dramatic narrative of the Revolutionary period. Excellent also for genealogists. However, genealogists may sometimes be a little frustrated that Leiby chose the most archaic form of each surname rather than attempt to arbitrate the most ""accurate"" spelling.One serious complaint, from the perspective of an historian, is that Leiby sometimes seems methodologically naive in his nearly uncritical support for the American side. He does not try to understand the Loyalists. Many of them were decent people, as demonstrated by books such as Philip Ranlet's The New York Loyalists. I think Leiby's book would have been much richer for it. Leiby is definitely worth reading."
4,"From the Black Hills, SD to the Bakery in Alma, CO","Bristlecone Peak is an enjoyable read. Certain elements cause me to question accuracy, like the 25 cent beer in 1887, tap beer was a quarter in the late 1950's and early 60's. But, it is easy to temporarily suspend reality and overlook these questions while Dave Brown transports us to the past.Living in the Black Hills and having spent much time in the Fairplay area, hearing Dave's descriptions of those wild and untamed areas is a delight.My partner and I took turns reading the chapters of this series out-loud to each other.We were reminded of Mel Brooks ""Blazing Saddles"" where The Kid says to Black Bart; ""These people are the ... common clay of the earth"". Though I'd honestly say Jake and Wiley are anything but common. Dave weaves a utopian vision of the past where people in the west are accepting and caring. Also, Daves use of spirituality should be noted. The magic and mysticism add greatly to the story."
4,Comprehensive Ballard Resource . . . though dated...,"This Re/Search volume includes a comprehensive bibliography and numerous interviews with Ballard, most done during the 80's. I was amazed to see an 80's interview with ballard by Grahme Ravell, who has come into fame in his own right since then. Re/Search Ballard also has numerous excerpts as well as The Atrocity Exibition in full. The volume is filled with intriguing Ballard quotes, photos and other Ballard miscellany that would surely be difficult or impossible to find anywhere else. Well packaged, informative and useful. For the Ballard fan, not the new reader."
5,Vision,"Buy this book and read a few pages every morning. Your days will be better because if it. The man has vision, and reading his words can help you focus your own. Great book."
5,The Ultimate Introduction,"This book is an amazing introduction to the works of a man with great thoughts. The introductory interview contains almost too much information and opinions; it is hard to wrap your mind around. But for those of you up to the challenge, it is great reading. Ballard's fiction and non-fiction excerpts are all enticing and the biography is very interesting, giving justice to the very exciting life Ballard has lived. An excellent read for anyone interested in finding a new author, or for those who simply want to read more of Ballard's works."
1,Shame on you Amazon.com for a misleading item image,"You clearly show an image of a ""Tank Conversion Kit"" with the words ""Milton S646 M. Hex Nipple 1/4 npt"" list price $28.86 - Price $3.62 You save $25.24 (87%)Under ""Product Specifications""Product InformationBrand: MiltonUnder ""Product Description""Item#: MILS682Customers also search for ......My complaint is you did not properly state that this was not an offer to sell a ""Tank Conversion Kit"" but only one small part (a 1/4 x 1/4 npt nipple) not even clearly pictured. No hints under ""Product Info"" or ""Product Description"". I don't think this is illegal just highly misleading and troublesome. Now you & I both have to deal with returned items. I have purchased many items from ""Amazon"" & this has never happened. Your ads have always been clearly stated and straightforward .... not hazy, unclear, & downright misleading. I'm very sorry."
1,Mold problem!,The plates seem nice at first but then we noticed something awful about them. When pulling one off our shelf we noticed there was mold covering the whole bottom side of the plate! I grabbed another plate and found more mold. They all had the same problem!I've never seen anything like this before so I did a google search only to find that other people who bought this brand posted similar reviews on Amazon. There must be some organic material inside the plate that allows this stuff to grow. We washed the plates in the sink and then in the dishwasher on high temperature but the mold still comes back!Since we got these plates as a gift there isn't much we can do except throw them away.
3,No digital imputs!,"I should have read the specs more carefully, but one would think that a home theater system that advertises itself as a 5.1 channel home theater system would have digital imputs that would enable you to actually here 5.1 sound! Yes, you can hear dvds in digital sound, but you can't imput anything into this receiver with anything other that rca imputs. So if you want to watch tv in digital sound, or xbox 360, or anything else, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this actually is a very nice sounding unit for its price and size."
4,Great system for the money,"Well I would like to say for the money this is a pretty good system. I read a few comments on this item. I would like to add I can hear the TV thru my system. you must add audio/visual cable (yellow/red) from TV to tv/VHR hook up on the rear of DVD system. True you will not have digital sound that's why I did not give this system a five. NO optical in or out!!! . But sound wise great to me. works just find with my Sony 60"""" HD TV. And the upconversion does work you must use a HDMI cable!! So all in all pretty good system just wish it had a optical out hook up..."
4,Good Buy Less some features,"This is a great system. But you wont have surround sound for TV. Still the effect is decent. The system has little dated looks, the DVD player is bulky and slow.But for the money, I think the system is good. DVD sound is AWESOME. setup is very simple."
4,"Looks Great, Sounds Great","I have this system connected into an Olevia 332H HDTV via an S-Vid Cable. The sound is simply amazing! The DVD playback is great as well.The radio signal is weak, but I tend to listen to internet radio anyways. The system also lacks audio inputs. I had to use RCA-Audio Splitters to allow me to connect everything together.It would be nice if the system had digital inputs so allow for 5.1 audio with other things other then just the DVD player.Overall, for the price, you get a great sounding system with great DVD playback. You lose out on some of the features needed in todays standard system, but you can't beat the price."
4,Very Good - for the price,"A home theater system, with a 5 DVD changer, equipped with an HDMI interface, at this price is a bargain. I bought this player a month ago and am quite satisfied with it. The speakers are sleek, the wires are long and quite enough for a large apartment and the sound quality is excellent. The best part is that the sound is crisp enough to be clear and audible even when the volume is turned down. The only reason I've given 4 stars instead of 5 is 'cause setting this up takes quite some effort and the surround speakers refuse to play when I play dvd movies! There's a TV and a VCR(!!??) input just in case you wanna output your TV audio to a 5.1 channel speaker system. All in all, a great system for a decent price!"
2,Could have been better,"This guide is good, but could have been better. It's basically a brief photo guide through the first few weeks of the series, ending with the wild card episode and the selection of R.J. Helton as contestant. Oddly, the book chooses to end there, a pretty strange place to end. I would have liked it better if the book had gone up to and including the final episode, and maybe included photos from the concert tour and Las Vegas spectacular televised concert. And maybe the lyrics to Kelly Clarkson's songs? Whatever. It's still a nice photo guide, but it's mainly that - glossy photos. There's some brief contestant interviews with the final ten that don't reveal much, a look at the elimination shows and some pages devoted to the auditions. To tell the truth, this book looks as if it was rushed into production. If you're an Idol fan, it'll be a nice photo album, but nothing else."
2,alot of gloss little substance,this book like the show has some talented folks but overall it's all about the stars as to really acknowledging the best talent.I give props to the shows founder because that is One of the Smartest Tv Moves.but like the show this Book doesn't go into much detail.
5,A pop genius who deserves some credit,"Humour, suave style, wit and charisma have always been at the heart of Neil Hannon, the one-man band in the Divine Comedy,a nd this best of showcases it well. Generation Sex is a snide dig at today's low cultural values, fetauring hilariously used talk show samples including a woman saying every woman should have at least 2 men. National Express, in honour of the UK travel firm, is also funny with it's lyrics about the 'jolly hostess' who will 'provide you with drinks, and theatrical winks, for a sky-high fee' as weel as having a great melody and character. Your Daddy's car and Lucy ar eprbably bets fo the songs reocrded befor ebecoming famous. Everybody Knows Except You is a gorgeous big-band style effort, one of the best here. The packaging of the 2CD version has really seen them go to town including lots of neat extras as well as some good lost tracks. A great collection of this whimsical genious' work"
5,Refreshing - Fresh Faith,"I grew up with simiiliar teachings and as I have matured several main stream denominations have departed from the prayer and faith that God desires from His people. I was delighted to know that God still works in many ways, as long as His people desire to call out to Him. Our church is beginning to return to its roots and several groups have started with its main purpose of prayer. Positive changes are occuring and its because God's people are returning to Him in prayer and discovering a renewing FAITH!Shel"
4,Faith In Action,I used this book for my Sunday School Class. It was a great sucess. The book demonstrates that through every day trials and tribulations God should always be our first source for successful and effective solutions.
5,"Old, old story...fresh, fresh faith","Pastor Cymbala lets God speak for himself in this book. God's old, old story of salvation which touches different people in different ways will touch you, too. Nobody can come away from this book without feeling revived, rebuked or wanting to know more of God's amazing salvation. PLEASE READ IT! Read it as a church, read it alone, buy it for others!"
5,Life Changing,"the degree to which this work impacted me is inexpressable -- it is doctrinally sound, intellectually balanced, unquestionably Spirit-inspired, motivating and encouraging -- i have worn out two sets by repeated listening and given several copies away -- this is worth listening to!!!"
2,"Not a Strong ""Follow-up"" Book","I read Fresh Wind Fresh Fire and could not put it down. It changed my life. However, I was very disappointed in Fresh Faith. I struggled to get through it. There is one section of the book that deals with Jeroboam that is outstanding - illustrating that we must trust God's plan and not our own thoughts. Most of the other stories and scripture references do not seem to interrelate well. Some stories are too short, some too long and few drive a point home. If you have read Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire, I would recommend re-reading it before purchasing this book."
2,Inspiring to an extent,The only drawback in my opinion was that the book focused mostly on all the good things - the situations that ended up happily-ever-after. I was looking to find true faith struggles - where God didn't do the thing that seems right. I also felt that the book conveyed a slight leaning toward word of faith.
3,Atlantis: Coral Quest,This is a definitely plan your next move first. Just have to get used to the fact you can only go around in a circle instead of normal play
2,Very disappointing.,"We tried for some time to play this (Windows XP), and it was just abysmal. Even with adjustments to slow the mouse, it moved wildly, there was very little control. Even kids who are experts on Xbox and Playstation thought this game was horrible."
4,Very Entertaining,"This is a documentary more than a (c)ocumentary, but I'm sure you're aware of that. This is a great series, albeit a bit short. But that just shows how enjoyable it was. I could have watched 2 more discs worth. I wish they would include more behind the scenes interviews and outtakes, for example. I don't have the first season, but from what I read, this was a bit better.I would definitely recommend this for those open minded liberal couples. It really is entertaining.MC White said: Check it out! Two thumbs up!"
3,Great Season,It was a bit short for a season and the episodes were very short. But the story was just as good as the first season.
4,Good if you like something different,"I got ""The Bagpipes of Latvia"" recently as a gift and I sat down and listened to it one afternoon. If you expect to hear a loud, bombastic, skirl indicative of the highland pipes emitting from your CD player, then prepare for disappointment. What you will hear is a buzzy and and somewhat reedy instrument. The pipes are called a ""duda"" or """"dudu"" and are quite crude in design and sound, but still produce the fine music you hear on the album. Most of the tracks are dance tunes, many of them have signing. An interesting listen if you enjoy unusual music."
1,THESE ARE REFURBS!,"Bought this drill thinking it was a good deal at about $85. Arrives today and I find it is a refurb! It is missing all the accessories, everything is scuffed up, there are drywall marks and pieces inside the case, and all the pieces are stamped with a big fat ""R"" letting you know it is a refurb. Learn from my mistake and don't buy this...and also don't buy any Hitachi refurbs. If their ""refurbishing"" process looks like this then forget about it."
3,Drill Chuck,"Drill will not hold a small (1/8' to 1/4th"") drill bit without slipping. I'm considering sending it back."
1,"Nice Drill, Crappy Battery Life.","I use this drill professionally since I'm a mobile electronics installer. I thought this drill was a good deal: 18-volts, case, charger, two batteries, and even a flashlight that uses the same battery.Problem is, the batteries won't hold a charge and this occurred only after a few months. Now I have to charge the batteries and use them immediately or they run dead. I can go through four or five charges in a day with only light use. The local hardware supply wants $89 for one Hitachi battery, more than I paid for two and the entire tool set."
4,Hitachi ds18DVB cordless drill,My only fault with this drill is the thin injection molded plastic holding the battery. Also as Popeye stated in the previous reveiw the chuck is not 1/2 inch but 3/8. The 1/2 on the chuck relates to the mount which is 1/2 x 20 UNF.
5,Money Money Money,"Written as he was driving cross country to deliver a large microwave filled with ketamine, JB's second book of pomes takes on the voice of Paul Simon to explain the travails of city life and the travails of tulips. It is wonderful and not nearly as pornographic as everybody says. ""Who is the tall white man with an afro behind me on this bike?"" a classic line among many. He's going to Graceland. Personally though I had issues with Mr. Crazy. He don't mean to brag, he don't mean to boast, but Josh Beckman loves hot butter on his breakfast toast. ... Truly, a wonderous book of epic lyrics in cinematic scope all, rumor has it, footnotes to a dictionary of music. Lovely. One life, you got to do what you should."
1,The worst,"Its awful to think somebody considered this s good idea to release. It sounds lousy, the pictures bad. I've seen better bootlegs."
3,Wrong color,"The quality of this item was very good, but the color was not what we expected. It is pretty red. We returned it and got the brushed nickel instead."
5,Awesome,"Mine is actually the 8HD (88-key), but essentially the same otherwise. I've loaded tons of sounds into it and there's nothing it won't do - and do well. It's too bad Alesis doesn't make these anymore. Never had a glitch of any kind with it. If you can get your hands on one, I would recommend it."
5,Furious Darkness,"Dark Funeral have made a furious assault upon your ears with this one. Some of the fastest and most brutal black metal made in the 21st century is on Diabolis Interium. Maniacal, grim, melodic and as serious as a nailgun held to your head, Diabolis Interium's intensity is so high that you might need to take a breather in the middle of the CD. Its just that relentless an assault of sublime blasphemy, these guys mean it."
1,Pyramid chest,"This purchase was kind of an experiment for me - I've never bought a bra online before so I thought I'd try it!Huge disappointment. The band was too tight, the material was scratchy, and the cups formed my breasts into these very strange cone/pyramid shapes. Very pointy, almost 50's style, which is NOT what was represented in the picture.The description is very misleading and I will not buy from this merchant again."
5,Need another!,"This is the first bra that I've ever purchased online and I'm so happy that I did! I couldn't believe how comfortable (shocking, I know) this bra was. The shoulder straps feel amazing since there's a little extra padding - I was worried that I looked like I had shoulder pads on, but my friend reassured me that I didn't and she was actually jealous that her bra didn't have that extra cushion. The size was a true fit for what I normally wear and I can't wait to add more of these to my collection."
3,"runs small, scratchy and uncomfortable","Be aware, you need to order a larger size or use bra extenders as this bra runs really small. The cups are smaller too. Its very scratchy material. I'm hoping after its been washed a few times it will soften up."
2,Love the shape -- hate the show through & puckering.,"I love the way this bra fits. The shoulder straps are soooooooo comfortable, the wire is well protected, the 3 rows of hooks are situated on a nice wide back strap. My problem stems from the lace cup design: 1) the lace covering shows through oxford shirts, turtle necks sweaters, and a variety of blouses; and 2) the lace doesn't lay flat and tends to pucker -- which presents a second kind of ugly ""show through"" problem. This would be my only bra IF it can in a single-ply smooth (no lace) cup.Oh...the beige tends to look like really faded/dingy white after only a couple of launderings. It should really be a good bit darker."
2,Pretty But SOOOO Uncomfortable!,"I was so excited to get this bra, all the reviews said how comfortable it was. But when I got it, the underwires poked the inside of my arms so bad I literally could not wear it. I don't know how anyone can wear this bra! On the plus side, my boobs looked great! I returned it and am getting a different kind."
2,Not Comfy,The reason I dis like this bra is the under wire comes right under my are pit so I constantly have a wire sticking in my arm pit. Other than that it fit fine but I really hate the wire under my arm pit
2,Uncomfortable,The shoulder straps are way too big and wide.There is no support in the cups.Fit is not great and feels uncomfortable.
4,Very comfy!,"I love the wide shoulder straps and the shape is nice. Band size sems to run a little small, I kinda wish that I had gone one up, but it is getting better with wear."
1,bra that does have any cushioning in the cups,the bra does not containing any cushiioning in the cups people will be able to see your nipple if you wear thus bra
3,Don't have strap issues? Don't get this.,"I'm a 40C, athletic, and 6' tall. This bra's big thing is the gel straps. I'm assuming this is to help those women whose straps dig into their shoulders alleviate that problem, but I didn't have the problem to begin with, so the straps didn't do anything for me. They feel bulky and wide. Otherwise, it works fine as a bra. But not my favorite in the bunch."
1,Not Cotton!!,"It should NOT be Legal for Playtex to call this bra ""Cottony."" That description is purposefully misleading.Here's what it's made of:""Cup, Cup extension, Support panel, Center, Cup lining, Center lining: 92% Nylon, 8% Spandex. Center Inner lining: 100% Nylon.""Yet, when searching Amazon and elsewhere for ""cottom bra"", this one comes up. I'm allergic to nylon, so I've had to learn to read the fine print. I highly recommend that anyone else who is looking for a *cotton* bra read the labels carefully, even if it takes using a magnifying glass."
2,Not for me.,"I ended up returning this. The bra, in my opinion, makes your breasst look ""torpido-ish"". It also has this loose fabric that hangs of the bra that makes your clothes look frumpy. Just wasn't very impressed. However, Amazon was speedy with my refund! :)"
4,"A bit scratchy, but a good fit","This bra fits well, but the lace makes it a bit scratchy. If it were in a different fabric it would be perfect."
4,fits nice,"This bra fits true to size and the straps are so comfortable that I forget they are there, having said that...i dont forget that the bra itself is there. The lace in the front kind of digs in after a few hours and starts to hurt and the wire on the side eventually start digging in but all in all this is a good comfortable bra that doesnt give you a funny shape"
1,not the best bra for me...,"For a ""comfort"" bra this was very uncomfortable! I usually wear a 36 to 38D but this one in 38D was very tight around the band and also itchy. This was even on the last hook. I don't usually wear Playtex so maybe the sizing is different -so it's back to Victoria's Secret for me. I was really hoping for a comfortable and supportive bra that didn't add anything - not so easy to find."
1,Not what was represented at all,"This bra was not even close to the portrayed photo. If fact, it is not even a platex bra!"
2,Not comfortable,I thought this would be a great bra but it is not as comfortable as I would like. The way it sits is not like how it looks in the picture.
3,Playtex Women's Secrets Cottony Gel Comfort Strap Underwire Bra,"The straps on this bra are very comfortable, and I guess if you can stand underwires, it's a good bra. Good fit, overall good bra, I just found the underwires to be very uncomfortable."
2,Waste of money.,"It's neither pretty, comfortable or supportive. I wish I never bought this item. I'm hoping I can still return it, but will it be worth the return shipping?"
2,not true to size,"loved the idea of cotton and the accent of lace, but once I rcv'd it, washed and finally wore it; it is very small. was not happy with this part. would really like it; if it actually fit."
4,Straps vs. Rest of Bra,"Overall, I'd rate this bra a B. I love the straps; they're amazingly comfortable. The rest of the bra, however, is mediocre comfort-wise. So it's good but not great. For the price I paid, I'd probably buy another one to replace this one when it's kaput!"
1,Do not buy if bustline is big!!,"The bra has no support at all for an underwire bra, will not buy this bra again. Use to lounge around house, cannot wear under good clothing because no support."
3,Odd Shape,This bra gives an odd shape and separates too much. The fit seemed true to size and the gel straps are great. Just wish it had either a softer cup or a molded cup. The material in the cup is too binding.
4,Don't even feel the straps! :),"Great Bra. I don't even feel the straps. They are soooo comfortable. I actually had to check to make sure the straps didn't fall off because I didn't feel them. I'm so used to buying bras that have the thin spaghetti straps, that finally having one like this is incredible.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because I wish they had of added a very thin layer of padding on the inside. Other than that, it's a great bra and would recommend buying it."
1,What a tease,"This dvd was a let down. The specialist barely gave me anymore information than watching youtube videos. Save your money. Watch people doing it on youtube. My skin care specialists watched it as well and just turned their heads in disbelief. They end up using a tweezer to shape the eyebrows for goodness sakes. I hoped they would give(at least three I know of) different techniques such as using the thread off the spool instead of making a loop. Or speaking about exact thread weight instead of just saying, ""use 100% cotton sewing thread"". They didn't talk about using different colored threads or any other pors and cons or speaking about different kinds of cooling gels or using numbing creams. Saira Soleri has a very thick accent and was also diffcult to understand. Very disappointed."
3,Good Overall Beginning Consulting Book,"Holtz does a pretty good job with touching on all the areas of Computer Consulting from the home or as an independent. My only complaint is that the author does not spend enough time with things like: creating proposals (an example or two would have been nice), fee structures (how to set your fee competatively), overhead calculation (only touches on this). A good starting place, but more in-depth books are needed to make a successful go of it. Do not depend on just this book."
1,"Silly, Childish Understanding of Human Psychology","Got to Mark's web page and watch his video. Would ANY woman date him? He speaks glibly without any real understanding whatsoever of real human nature, human psychology. The proof? Apparently ALL woman are the same, and ALL want the same things in men. Wow.. that would be a much easier or boring world wouldnt it? This is utterly SEXIST and also moronic. It IS possible to understand the differing motivations, drives, needs and values of people. The mystery can be solved. But NOT with a one-size fits all, cook-book, extremely vapid approach.So what mark if you listened to women in your ""coaching"" business for 10 years. You heard nothing. And that is nothing new."
1,What A Waste of Money!!,"What a load of pedestrian tripe this book turned out to be. And I don't attribute it to Katz, since I liked his other book. The fault lies solely with Holmes who is completely unbelievable as any kind of dating/relationship coach. She writes in a manner that clearly conveys she has not had a date in years, nor does it sound as if she is likely to have one in the near future. While Katz' advice is cogent and can be practically applied, Holmes sounds like a loser wallflower who wouldn't know the first thing about attracting a man. For any woman who actually wants to get a DATE (much less a MATE) sometime this century, I say stay away from this and any other relationship manual with Holmes' name attached to it!!"
1,The Real Reason Women Fall for Jerks,"Here we go again; another self-help book for the whining Bridgett Jones in all of you, complete with another explanantion for why you fall for jerks. Take it from a jerk: women fall for men who are sexy, hunky, and pleasing in bed. Period. It's got nothing to do with being a jerk. Jerks are not really attractive; after all, how many of you have fallen for a really whimpy, ugly, nerdy jerk? And if you do happen to luck out and find a guy whose both sexy and kind, wouldn't you fall for him instead? It' simple; it's the law of the jungle. Women want to feel protected and safe in the knowledge that the longer they hang out with a big, strong, sexy guy, the more likely they are to be impregnated by him and produce desirable offspring."
1,Nothing New,"Nothing new and not even funny (which seems to be the main intent). Much too focused on generalizing about women's flaws and how these supposedly limit chances for relationships.This book won't change your life--or even provide a good laugh. (The irony that neither author is him/her-self successful in maintaining a long-term relationship seems lost on both of these ""advice-givers""). Not recommended."
3,Enjoyable read with some useful advice,"I picked up a copy of this book because I am a fan of Evan Marc Katz's articles and blog. Much of the advice written here is common sense for down-to-earth women, however, I see many women who would do well to heed the words of wisdom within the book. It's also engagingly written, and a quick read. But even for those down-to-earth folks, there are some gems in here that really help me in my own thinking.I found the best chapters to be:Guys Don't Go Both WaysDeal Breakers (particularly Linda's piece)Hitting on 20There's good advice in here, and it's not all new agey, which tends to cause me to stay away from dating and self-help books. Groundbreaking? Not exactly. Enjoyable? Yes."
2,Not so helpful,"I think this book has some good ideas, and makes you think about your habits that may be driving people away. But it really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. The two points of view, man and woman, were also helpful. This book was ok but not really worth the money. I'm still single."
1,Not helpful; not humorous.,"As Julie SCY said, this book isn't original or funny. It was a boring, dry read that I couldn't finish. The authors tried too hard to be funny. Although the book was short, it was too wordy. Holmes seemed to repeat whatever Katz said. I don't recommend it."
1,Not Ready For The Market,"I purchased this receiver because of its claimed HDMI capability - there are no others yet on the market much under $1000.I could not get it to perform properly with my home theater, including HD plasma TV, with HDMI or component connections. I called JVC's service desk. After encountering several levels of expertise on their side, I was told the receiver needed a ""firmware upgrade"" in order to operate as claimed. I said I would just return it to Amazon for another, but JVC intimated that I would only encounter the same problem. I had to ship it to JVC's service center, at my expense. After 10 days, I called the center, and was told it had been received a week earlier, but had not yet been assigned to a technician. I could expect a four to six week time period before it would be returned.I'll write another review when I get it back, and report on its performance."
3,Some problems,"Purchased this because it had two hdmi inputs. I was hoping to hook up my DVR and a high end DVD player. Found that using both hdmi inputs was problematic, ended up inputting the DVD player as Component video with optical sound. Tech support was baffled."
2,functional hoodie...but...,"The sweatshirt I received didn't look exactly like the one pictured. I was hoping the disign on the front would be small enough that it wouldn't look too manly or goth, and maybe i could even cover it with a patch if i had to. The hoodie that arrived at my house had a design so big that it went over the zipper onto the other side of the hoodie and is at least an arms length down. It was also not the same design pictured. Instead of a small skull I have a giant skull with nails in it's uhh skull, and the body of a snake and it's eyes are dripping blood. It ended up making me look far more butch and goth than I can handle. But it was only $5; it would have cost me more to return it. So i'll just give it to some teenaged boy."
3,"Not great, but not bad either...","This cd is not that bad, but I don't think there are many great songs on it either. A lot of them sound very similar and many sound like older songs, looping segments from 80s songs. Megamixes I always like because they play snippets of all the songs. But my favorite songs on this cd are:IntroEnd-- I like it because it reminds me of that song on Pure Moods ""Tubular Bells""Blow the speakers--I heard it at a club and istantly liked it.Get up boyFollow meFantasy-- I like the way the woman sings on itBlow the speakers (remix)Final Chapter-- even though it sounds a lot like 3. This was also on a Louie Devito cd I believe.The rest of the songs on the cd aren't horrible, but they are on the boring side and really don't compliment some of the other songs. Overall its an ok cd, but I'm sure you can find a lot better out there."
2,The trial version was better.,"I played the trial version of this game years ago and it was fun. Disclaimer: I'm not much of a ""gamer"" and maybe I just didn't get the hang of it? But I set it on the easiest setting and still was whomped by the computer player time after time. I felt after several attempts at a new game, that this was dumb and I didn't want to play anymore. I feel like my ability to play computer games was not so lacking that I should have had such troubble."
2,Really People...,"If you want HOMM, get Heroes III or IV, geez this one is a JOKE compared to the others!!!I'll still give it two stars though because it is a 3DO product."
1,No Customer service - anywhere!,I bought a set of these lights. Supplied switch is defective. Supplier says Amazon has to handle problem. Amazon says they can't handle problem. Same old finger-pointing junk. Who get screwed? Guess who...? The customer. Very poor Hella! Very poor Amazon!
3,Albert Hall Reunion Concert Transcription Once More,"On both sides of the Atlantic spring up recycled tracks from the Everlys Reunion Concert at Albert Hall just as plants do, arising yearly out of the ground in unexpected places during copyright expiration season... This is yet another repackaging, nothing new here; you can get even more songs for about the price--from the same event by looking a little further amongst these listings. Life is too short to have to verify the duplication of these weeds."
1,"Okay, but a bit outdated","I'm a first time cancer victim and purchased several books concerning cancer therapies, diet related to cancer therapy, etc. I felt this book was a bit out dated compared to a couple of the other books I've read. I will probably donate it to my local library. I really liked ""Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients"" by Dr. Blaylock. It was more in line with what my practitioners were telling me, and had useful dietary information not only for use during cancer treatment, but for life. I also liked ""A Dietician's Cancer Story"" by Diana Dyer who also has a website. This book was quite inspirational. I didn't know anyone could still be alive after having cancer three different times in one's life!!"
4,Digital Artist? After reading this book you'll besome one!,"One of the best books on market dedicated developing creative skills in Adobe Photoshop. What is more important, it's rather ""how to do"" book, then technical reference or manual. I reccomend it!"
2,Very disappointed with this shoe!!!,"If you have a short big toe, this is not the shoe for you. I have short wide feet so my foot stopped way before the edge of the shoe. The toe ring was most uncomfortable along with the straps. Great if you have long slender feet."
4,Pain in hip flexors almost completely gone after one session,"The book is excellent but I prefer Pain Free's format.Of course, Pain Free was published in 1998 and this book was published in 1992."
2,Get Pain Free instead,An early book by Egoscue. The same information is better presented with better illustrations in a later book entitled Pain Free. I recommend it instead.
2,Can you spare two and a half hours every day?,You are supposed to do 10 to 12 exercises every day. Here are some of these exercises and the duration of each:- Supine Groin Stretch...1 hour 30 minutes (45 minutes each leg).- Static Back Stretch...30 to 45 minutesIf you can spare so much time every day then the Egoscue Program might prove beneficial.This is the second time in two months I write the same review. The first must have been rejected for some reason.
3,Egoscue,"I did the exercises faithfully for a couple of years, but unfortunately, they didn't work for me. I went back to a conventional program of general fitness, stretching and core strengthening and that has made a noticeable improvement. Perhaps the method is more effective for younger bodies."
4,very interesting book,"I totally agree with the things said in this book, it makes sense that the body was designed to move. Reading this book definitely made me want to out and move more. However, the exercises proposed in this book are definitely for people in pain are have been dysfunctional for a while. The exercises do not get very advanced. However, this is still a good book that will motivate you to find more advanced exercises."
4,good with some flaws,"This is a good book with some flaws. The exercises are great. However, once you determine which type of exercises you need and go to the list, there are no page numbers (only names of the exercises) which would have allowed you to easily refer back to the page that the particular exercise description is on. This makes it extremely frustrating to have to flip back and forth to find the needed exercise. I ended up putting lots of post it notes in the book with page numbers sticking out. This could have very easily been avoided with the addition of page numbers on the exercise list. Also, several exercises do not have illustrations making it difficult (unless you are a trainer or physical therapist) to know if you are really doing it correctly. ALL of the exercises should have had illustrations."
5,Awesome,"Awesome. Anyone, especially athletes should read this book and do the exercises. It will dramatically improve your technique no matter what sport you play."
1,Terrible fishing pole,"We bought this to be used as our son's first fishing pole. I opened the package while he eagerly awaited. Unfortunately, the set is a EXTREMELY poor quality. The rod fell apart in my hands -- the little trigger piece fell out and the inside of the rod crumbled into the table. I re-assembled it. But, the rod just would not work. The line wouldn't come out when I pressed the trigger release. To no avail, I tried every way possible to fix the rod and had some friends look at it. Nothing worked.Overall, this set is really weak and exemplifies the problems with selling a cheap Chinese-made pole. It tarnishes the good ""Shakespeare"" name and the history of decent fishing poles. I'd willingly pay double the price to have something that would last and actually work!Also, this is not a complete set. Anyone who buys one of these and manages to get it to work properly will also need to buy a hook and a sinker. This does not come with either!Overall: AVOID THIS TERRIBLE FISHING KIT."
2,Super cute but broke before it was out of the package..,"My 2 year old was super excited to receive this item. It came fast, exactly as described. We went on a family camping trip and put it in the car. It may have been our fault I dont know but it's still not out of the package and the line broke ; ("
4,Go to bait shop first!,"Just got this very cute pole in today for my grandson. seems pretty durable, however you will need to get a bobber, a weight and a lure in order to go fishing!!!!"
3,Great rod but....,"I'm not sure exactly how to rate this rod. It is WONDERFUL as far as durability, casting, the cute little tire that is tied to the end. I'd give it 5 stars!Only one problem is that the packaging clearly states that it contains lead. Does not say exactly what part.Not so good for a children's toy....I actually contacted the company. They said that there was trace amounts in the paint but that it still passed safety standards.So...I guess like houses build before 1978, unless the paint is chipping or if they chew on it and eat the paint chips then they should be fine!"
1,Reel was broken,"Everything looked okay, but the reel was broken. Pressing the button doesn't release the bale. I unscrewed the cover, but it didn't have any user serviceable parts. Also, the rod and reel are a single unit, so it is impossible to replace the reel.We also purchased an Incredible Hulk fishing rod by Shakespeare that is less of a toy and more of a real fishing rod. I would recommend it over this item."
4,Video Light,The unit is much bigger that what it looks like online...very bright and heat up very fast. It's more for person in videography.
3,Good and Colorful,"Intersting book full of the distinctive stye of the Hun. His drawings are certainly fanciful, but they do not dissapoint. He draws a world of fantasy where the erotic parts of this subjects are larger than life, for example, sex organs are bigger, chests are more hairy, armpits more sweaty, the sex is rough and testosterone rolls from the pages. If this is intereting to you then you will enjoy this slim though impressive retrospect of artwork by The Hun"
2,HOW TO GET OVERCHARGED AND SHORTCHANGED AT THE SAME TIME,"It is incomprehensible to me why anyone would pay $16.99 for this abridged 15 track COLLECTION when for $19.99 you can buy the full 2 CD DEFINITIVE COLLECTION from which these were taken.DEFINITIVE COLLECTION (480548 9) is a product of Sony/Holland,and its studio CD contains all 15 tracks listed here in the same sequence (except where interrupted by deleted tracks) plus 10 more, for a total of 25 songs with a listed playing time of 72: 12. Some of COLLECTION's deletions are significant, like ""Bells of Rhymney"" and ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"". DEFINITIVE COLLECTION's second disk reedits four live performances from ""(Untitled)"" into a 24:56 minute mini-concert.See my review of that album elsewhere.Meanwhile the only thing unique about this one is the album cover, so be really really sure you like it before buying this."
1,Pointless intermission in a sub-standard series,Cordell has cobbled the leftover scraps of the 1st and 3rd modules into this patchwork. Players cannot affect the course of the story. They are just spectators along for the ride. The title has almost nothing to do with the module except referring to the heavy-handed way Cordell sets events in motion.
3,could be brighter,I am pleased with the window candles - they do fit the window sills real well and fit between the middle pane of my windows. The only negative comment I would have is that the candles are not as bright as they could be and cannot be seen when on the cul-d-sac in front of our home.
3,A bit disappointing,These are too flimsy for my liking and the lights are not very bright...I would not recommend this product for the price. I just put them up last night and am already thinking who I might give them to because I don't really care for them.
1,led candles for window,This product does not work properly. They do not turn on and off as described.
2,Would be nice - if it worked,"Only 2 of the 3 lights would come on automatically at dusk. However, manually turning it off and then on would get all 3 to work (huh?). But all 3 never lit on their own. It was returned - no hassle, no expense, to Amazon for a refund.I have several of the single lights and they work fine. Be advised that they're not very bright looking from the outside but I love the soft glow they give inside my home.The heavy batteries in the base make them very stable on the windowsill. The batteries seem to last about 4 - 5 weeks - enough for the Christmas season."
5,Exactly what I want!,Oustanding performance and beauty. Lovely soft glow of candlelight from dusk to dawn. Choice of flicker or constant glow. Delighted!
4,Very pretty and convenient,"I'd give this five stars if they were a tad brighter, but it's definitely visible in the windows, and probably looks more like candles because it isn't extremely bright. They're very convenient, with the light sensor built in, so they come on as soon as it gets dark (which around here is about 4pm) and go off at sunrise."
2,Not too thrilled . . .,"I'm disappointed with this candle. Reasons? (1) I expected the candle glow to be white, but it's more of a yellowish orange, (2) the base that is called ""pewter"" is actually closer to GOLD, and (3) the base where the batteries are stored does not click shut. If we pick up the candle and forget to hold onto the base, it will fall apart, and the batteries will fall on the floor. I'm thinking about returning it, but what will I do with the set of 4 ""D"" batteries I bought and opened? I'll probably keep it, but with some regrets."
5,Best school-based comedy anime series,"Warning: This anime may cause you to laugh uncontrollably for extended periods of time or make you laugh out loud like a megalomaniac.Anyway, on to the review. This is without a doubt the best school-based comedy anime series I have ever seen. You get a barrage of non-stop slapstick comedy throughout all of the episodes contained in this box set. Plus, the character(and their developments), storyline, animation, soundtrack, and character designs are all excellent. I think this anime is better than the other shows in the same sub-genre that are popular among other anime fans, like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh, in my honest opinion. So, if you want an alternative to shows like Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, and etc or just want to see a high quality comedy series, give this anime a try."
5,Amazing!,"School Rumble has got to be one of my favorite anime's of all time! Now if I could tell you what the show is really about I couldn't, but i can tell you it is a love story. Harima the hopeless idiot is in love with a girl in his class Tenma (who is also a hopeless idiot). Threw laugh out loud situtations they both try to confess their love. Unfortunatly for them their plans never end up like they'd expect. As the seasons progress the story gets deeper, and by the time you finish season 2 you'll be waiting for season 3 to arrive!"
5,This series is simply amazing.,"I fell in love with all the characters. Harima is amazing. Yakumo is too, Tenma, and Rich Girl. I love them all. This show is also hilarious. Buy this amazing set and have this masterpiece in your collection forever. 10 discs of nonstop entertainment."
5,more triangles than in a geometry class,"Usual chaotic love triangle story, which naturally branches out to more and more members until it resembles a dodecahedron more than a triangle. And of course those with the least in common cause the most attraction, while the really good matches are ignored. This results in musical chairs situations as everyone keeps changing seats to ride together on a field trip, numerous macho contests to win the love while denying any love interest, disguises, trying to get alone (No. no! with her, not you!), attempts to aid that hurt, misunderstandings galore, and lots of fights ending with the lines 'Why are we fighting?' answered by 'I forget.' In short while love may not reign supreme, chaos, confusion, and humor do."
4,Traditional Music,"Hey, this music sucks. But then did you expect polish from the Skillet Lickers and the Fruit Jar Drinkers? This is the real McCoy for traditional hillbilly music, straight from the billy's mouth. Folk music performed by the folks, from a time when nobody was embarrassed to sing, before country music became ""pop rock"" and sterile. It aint gonna hit top 40 today - and that is a compliment."
5,Excellence,"I just listened to this CD today and it is truly unlike any other Christmas CD I have experienced. Jazzy, upbeat, fun and romantic, this Cd does not become grating after multiple listens. Kathy's re-interpretation of the classics breathes new life into them and makes them a new treat instead of ""yet another version"" of a familiar song. Great job Kathy!!!!"
4,Great price....longevity to be determined......,"Let's face it....these are plastic. The metal counterpart costs 4+ times the price. No one can tell....other than touching them....that they are plastic. They look great and provide nice light. The initial assembly was a tad cumbersome....but after getting into assembly line mode....went quickly after the first 2 or 3 were together. After that.....getting them spiked into the ground and lighted up took about 15 minutes. The clip-on electric terminals for each light to the main wire worked very well. Had them now for over three weeks...no problems. Included timer is a nice bonus, although I turn mine on/off with the outdoor light switch.We'll see how they stand up to time. Even if they last only a few seasons....it was worth it to see if I really like the ""Malibu"" look....before I spend a couple of hundred dollars on the metal ones."
1,Terribly Cheap looking,"Product comes in a box in hundreds of pieces. The whole thing is made from cheap plastic and hardly stayed together. After putting it all together, It was missing some pieces. So I called in to get the missing parts sent to me. You can not get missing parts sent to you unless you fax in a request after printing off a bunch of documents and proof of purchase. It took over 3 weeks to get the missing parts in. After FINALLY hooking everything up and all, half of the lights didn't light up. It was the worst money I have ever spent on things for my home.I hope this keeps someone else from making the same mistake I did with buying this product."
4,Malibu 10-Pack Low Voltage Plastic Lights LX10610T25,"For the price its a bargin, comes with the spade lug bulbs too. The only issue is the height of the tubes, only about 4 inches off the ground. I like them up more but these are still fine for most walkways. The heads even fit 10 year older model posts with the three tabe twist on design."
4,Economy Outdoor Lighting - that looks and works well,"I use low-voltage lights around my house outside, the type you need to plug into an outlet, because I have too many trees and shadows that limit the effectiveness of solar lights. You can spend a lot, or a little on these. I decided to spend less. These lights work nice! If someone kicks the plastic light, it will come apart, but under normal use they are fine. These even work well in Wisconsin where we get 100 inches of snow a year and temps dip to 20 below zero (F) with wind chills and drifts etc making it pretty hard for these to survive, but they do. I leave them out all year, even in the cold and snow. Replacement bulbs are easy to find at any hardware or garden center."
2,Malibu lights,"For the money, this product is adequate. If you are looking for malibu lights to dress up your home, these are plastic and will not hold up in the southwest summer sun for only a couple of years before deteriorating.But for around $30 for 10 lights with wire and transformer, they will do the job of lighting up your home at night just fine."
3,Magellan Companion for Palm m500,"This is a great product that works very well with the Palm m500. The Rand McNally Street finder is very useful as well. However, I have encoutered problems connecting the unit the my Palm m500. It worked well for about 2 weeks, but now the two products do not snap together well and it is now virtually useless."
4,Glider Pilot,"So far the Companion has worked well. It locks on to the satellites quickly and seems to stay locked on. There are two things that I think would have made this unit better. First, when I attached the PDA there was no way to tell if the unit was on. A light would have been nice. Second, the only way to turn the unit off is by removing the PDA so an on/off switch would also have been nice so I could leave the PDA attached."
3,Works great but,"Had to return the first one because it was broken. Second one works great, even in car (won't lock on when I'm flying a Gulfstream V but it's not certified for IFR Navigation anyway). Needs to include maps program for systems other than Windows (ie, Mac). This is easily remedied by using a web-based mapping program. Also would do away with need to update Streetfinder databases. Also, having trouble getting Road Atlas expansion card to recognize the GPS Companion. Don't know if it's Palm, Magellan, or Rand McNally. Have contacted Rand McNally. Just be aware that there might be an issue if your using this expansion card."
4,"This thing is great, It even works on my M130","This thing rules! It took me an hour to get all the stuff installed and working, but it iz awesome. I don't know wut the other people were talking about when they say that the Mapping Software is bad, i think it rules! After some minor shaving, i got it so that my m130 works with it, how crazy is that? Espacially with the rebate, this thing rules!"
2,Really just a toy,"The GPS device is cool, but the Rand McNally Streetfinder software is junk, really worthless. In the Northeast corridor where you would expect the data to be a little more precise, the software often says you are ""off course"" even when the position icon shows you exactly on course. And the plotted course route is often not the best route, sometimes it is dowright wacky. Should I mention that I am still waiting (six months later) for my mail-in rebate?"
1,very basic,It seemed like a great idea to have the GPS integrated with the Palm--I figured I'd be able to quickly edit waypoints without having to thumb through all the characters and it would be a simple hotsync operation to get them on my computer--but there are very limited options in the preferences menu. You can't select your coordinate system or datum. For those of us who want to actually work with maps or use these units in the field it's a major design flaw.It's far easier to work with UTM when you are going back and forth with a map than trying to deal with lat/long decimal numbers. I'm disappointed in the unit and frustrated that the lack of such a basic feature was not clearly stated in the advertising. Unless I can find some alternative software (a call to customer support confirmed that Magellan doesn't support UTM for this unit) I'll have to return the unit and go back to using my stand-alone unit.
2,"Could have been good, but falls short.","This movie could have been good, as it is interesting how a rodeo girl struggles to become a champion. Unfortunately, it has kind of a ""B"" movie feel to it. As the lines are delivered rather flatly and the acting is lacking some spark. It also dwells too much on the lead's difficult relationship with her husband. On the one hand, it does show the having a family versus having a career dilemna that pretty much every girl faces at some point in her life. And it shows the very traditional male's mindset of what he expects in a wife. So it would be a good movie for a gender studies class or women's history course. However, as far as leisure watching is concerned, I was the only one who finished the movie. The other's with me, who were watching it fell asleep.On a side note, the lead movie star is quite an attractive actress."
3,It depends...,"If you are looking for a sheet book like Norah Jones' first one, with big simple notes this is NOT it.But if you can read music well this is the book for you."
1,Misguided Population,"While I respect hard work and connections, I can't seem to find anything good to say about this artist. Her sound is an amalgamation of existing styles (to the extreme). To consider her a ""Jazz"" artist is pure fiction. My advice is to seek out the original practitioners of this sound and leave the imitators to the confused masses."
1,A total nightmare,"I bought the ar320 over a year ago and have had nothing but problems from day one. The keyboard had to be replaced twice, replaced the processor and finally the motherboard. It worked ok for a few months and I went to turn on yesterday and it would not power up. Sony tech support is a waste of time. Windows Vista is a joke. I regret the day I went with a sony. I totaly bought a lemon and I now own a $1800 paperweight."
2,Not as Good,I didn't like this book as much. I own every Robin Jones Gunn book available and i was sadly disappointed with this book. I found it kind of boring. I read it really quickly and got very little out of it. I also didn't like that this thin little diary had 5 years of her life in it. It missed way too much. The only part i really liked was when she was talking about the meaning of her 'Forever' bracelet
5,Great Bible Study for studying Daniel,"I am really pleased with this study guide. There are introductory descriptions of what is happening in each chapter of Daniel. Then there is a translation of the chapter, and verse by verse study notes (which no doubt were later inserted into the MacArthur Study Bible).But the best part of the study would have to b the excellent questions. There is always an introductory question that gets you thinking about some of the material in the chapter. then there are content oriented questions then application oriented questions.I have used Max Lucado's study on Daniel in the past, but it cannot even begin to compare with the richness of this study. This is the best study guide on Daniel I have come across. I am looking forward to using it for years to come.Rev. Marc Axelrod"
5,a gift,this was a gift for christmas. I'm told it's wonderful. It arrived in plenty of time and at a good price.
3,not the best,"this is not the best compilation of Armstrong's talent I have ever heard,I was disappointed.."
3,Color suela,"en terminos generales me parecio buen tennis, sin embargo el color azul de la suela se agrieta y se ve bastante feo"
1,This game could be better!,When I first saw the game it looked like fun. After I took it home and played it I was very disappointed. You use a tank throughout the whole game and do nothing but shoot the same o same o. Every mission is basically the same and looks pretty much the same. If you like a game where every mission is the same this game would be for you other wise spend your hard earned money on something that is worth it.
3,More of the same. Two tracks stand out.,"This release was a real lettdown after Max Grahms previous installment. It's the same boring phase in start with some good selections, but none really go anywhere. i was really shocked by how flat the hybrid mix was. No bang, just a fizzle. I could do without this one. Or the sandra collins cream set either, for that matter.The matter of repetitious progressive house.Buy Rennaissance revelation. This is the art of house."
2,Not Accurate Enough,"I've had this for a couple of years now and am overall disappointed with its accuracy. While it is definitely a time-saver (and somewhat of a headache-saver), it really isn't anywhere near accurate enough, so I still have to go through each card I've scanned to edit them.The only benefit to me is that I can enlarge a copy of the business card and so it saves my poor, aging eyes."
4,Card Reader,I have never used one before but it is very easy. Of course it reads most of the cards and does a pretty good job of getting the information right. You do have to go through and check each one for accuracy. I am amazed that it can figure out what it does. Quick and easy to put in to categories. Haven't tried using the information yet but I assume that will be just as easy.
3,"Not bad, but still a lot of work","Like a lot of business professionals I had hundreds of business cards sitting on my desk, some were already in my computer's address book, some not.I couldn't even think of trying to manually enter all of these so I purchased the Penpower Business Card Reader.It was easy to set-up and to feed the cards into the scanner, however you just can't export them to Entourage or whatever address book system you are using. You really have to look at each card you scanned to ensure it is accurate because many are not.So there is still a lot of editing you have to do (and I am not even done with this part yet), so just take this in consideration before you buy.This product will save you some time, but it is not a complete solution."
2,It's not good enough,"The Scanner caused a little problem at first. After I restarted my computer, it worked ok. But the software was not good. My computer was P4 3.2GHz with 1G Ram, but the software consumed pretty much all the power of my computer. No other application could run. The user interface had to refresh for every inch you scroll. Imagine spending 20 seconds just to scroll from the top to the bottom of your contact list. I had to return it."
4,Color Business Card Scanner,"Software installed without issues, which is always a blessing. Aside from requiring an expanded USB hub, Scanner was plug and play. Does everything the ads say and works flawlessly. Very pleased with the purchase. Was cost effective and does an excellent job. I'd highly recommend as a consideration."
5,Good Value for Money,"The Penpower WorldCardColor Color Business Card Scanner is exactly as advertised and a great price. Less expensive than most other card scanners. Software is a little cumbersome but very workable. I like the fact you can directly scan into ACT! If you are a serious networker, use a contact manager and don't have a card scanner you're either losing potentially valuable contacts or don't collect business cards."
1,Bugs and No Support,"There is a bug in the software. When you transfer the old file save under previous version to the new version, all Chinese characters became scribble. When we called, they said they would get back to us. Then, they said they could not provide any technicall support. They hung up the phone. I guess this is their style."
5,Great business card scanner!,"WorldCard Color is such a great product. I have been using it for three months and it really saves my time! I used to put all the business cards that I have collected into my briefcase. When I needed to contact my clients, I either sent emails to them individually by typing each individual's email address, or I called them individually. This was very inefficient and time consuming. With WorldCard Color, I can send massive emails from the software directly to my clients without too much typing. In addition, I can synchronize my Palm Desktop with WorldCard. This allows me to contact my clients any place anywhere I like. I highly recommend this product."
1,"Not a good scanner, freezes A LOT","I am not so happy with this scanner. It is my first scanner and I read the reviews before I purchased it. I understood that the scanner will not recognize any fancy fonts, thick cards, or unusual card designs but no one mentioned the fact that this scanner freezes after 3-4 cards. Once if freezes, you have to unplug it, and plug it again and redo.I am very disappointed and do not recommend it to anyone. I ended up scanning 400 cards, but it took me 9 hours to do (did not even include my hours modifying each card). I know I did spend that much time because I am a bookkeeper and I use a timer when I work on projects.My recommendation, shop around and go with a scanner that has better reviews even if it cost you a little more. If I had known then what I know now, I would have bought a different one. Good luck!"
5,Great Unit,Service and delivery was excellent. Bought this for my husband for his real estate business. He loves it. Scans and helps organize all of those loose business cards
3,Not logo friendly,Standard business cards great. Any unusual punctuation or logo's merged within company names needs manual correction. Still a time saver if any quantities involved.
4,excellent value,"Everything worked perfectly, and even gracefully dealt with a hangup. My only complaint is the roughly translated dialogs. The software was clearly writeten for another language and translated, and the translation is of middling quality. Was able to figure out meaning of most commands without too much trouble."
3,Biz card scan,"The product is easy to use and the scan results on screen are good but the break-up of grouping is not consistant, scanning similar cards gives different results."
4,It's not a duplex scanner,"I was looking for a duplex card scanner to scan ID/insurance cards at a medical practice. Amazon did not have information on this scanner to say for sure, but some other sites online did note that this is scanner can do double-sided scanning. This is *not* a duplex scanner. The included software allows the user to scan a double-sided card as a single record, but the user must manual scan both sides of the card separately. There are other scanners out there that can scan both sides in a single pass...Ambir and ScanShell both make these types of scanners."
1,didn't work for me,I received an error when I tried to load the software on two different computers at work. I also tried with my laptop at home... after a very long upload period.. it worked. It calibrated fine and I scanned about 10 cards and then it stopped recognizing the text. I re-calibrate 6 times and couldn't get it to work again. Now I am going to return it.
1,An embarrassing disappointment,"Tasked with creating a database of all the conatcts in my company, I did quite a bit of research on card scanners. The Penpower scanner had good reviews & seemed user friendly. And it was, at first. I successfully scanned TWO business cards before the software stopped recognizing the scanner hardware. I have since attempted to contact customer service literally DOZENS of times (it's now just the first thing I do when I get to work every morning) & have yet to hear back. Their website has a form that you fill out & submit - no 800 number is listed or anything. I just fill out the form & send it over & over & over again."
4,great buy,I purchased this for someone at work - they use it and feel it's a fairly easy item to use.
4,Really Good for Scanning Cards,"The PenPower WorldCard Color scan does its job of scanning cards. I use it to scan insurance cards at my work and it scans them very nicely. However, it does poorly with paper-type cards and the image that shows up appears wrinkled. Another issue I had with the scanner is the fact that if I place the cards at the left side of the scanner, there is a tendency to cut off information on the left side of the card I am scanning so I have to position the card in the middle of the scanner and make sure it's straight as it goes through, as the card can tilt during the scanning process.The software is a little tricky to use so take the time to learn how it works. Recognition System is not perfect: it can misread certain parts of the card as the person's name and number (i.e. Company Name listed as the person's Name). Photo scanning is not recommended with this type of scanner: the resulting image will have a vertical line running across the picture."
2,Definitely not for heavy use,"I bought this to move all business cards that my manager had accumulated over the years to an easier format for searching. On our network it was a pain to load the software. The scanning was sub-par at the beginning, combining information from one card to another until I realized I had to mess with the settings repeatedly. It doesn't scan special fonts or logos well and almost every company we do business with uses one or both. I've transferred the info to Excel so that I can make corrections quickly and more accurately but moving them back into WorldCard or transfer to Google contacts is a messy process. I'm less than impressed and would have gone with a more accurate scanner had I known."
3,cfo,Generally works well with microsoft equipment but dose not work with apple and all information is required to be verified as it is not always correct.
5,it really happened (and it still happens),I come from the town in question and beeing a child I once recieved my candy from the American St. Nick. (It was one of the years he had come back to play his role again.) I can remember that we children make fun of the way he tried to speak to us in luxembourgish. But what I didn't realise by then was the whole story behind it; I knew it was something special about it but I couldn't explain why. Now after having grown up and after having read the book I know that what they did was something very special.
5,WWII GI Gift,"In this time, when our Veterans from World War II are realizing how much we all need to hear their stories, THE AMERICAN ST. NICK is a heart-warming one grandfathers can share with their grandchildren, helping them to see that behind the face of the Warrior beats a father's heart. No matter that the young men thought what they were doing was just a lark.Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE AMERICAN ST. NICK as a fine recollection of one shining moment in a dark horrendous conflict that glows like a child's grin. It is a tale, simply told, of bringing joy to some needy children & their community. It is also the story of how one town never forgot the GIs who gave of their bounty, & by doing so resurrected the Spirit of Christmas for a devastated people. Nor have they forgetten those GIs who gave their lives & never went home."
2,Not what I expected.,Although this product is what they described; it is not all that I expected. It is very difficult to set and i can't imagine messing with the alarm. It is perfect for my 5 year old as he doesn't care about anything but the projection. The projection is very small on the ceiling and points out of the back of the soccer ball. This is the part that I find useless. I have to turn the digital image facing the wall so that the projection will shine. Very useless for a projection clock.
3,"yeah, right.","Erratically programmed and dubiously described, this disc is, in my humble opinion, somewhat of a sham. Taken from the vaults of obscure latin labels such as Sound Triangle, General and Studio 3, this is more or less a set of substandard latin dance material from the '60s and '70s, with a few soul- and rock-oriented tunes placed (almost at random) among the sones and boleros. There are some good percussive performances on several tracks, but also plenty of weak vocal performances and mediocre arrangements... hardly the slam-bang funkfest implied by the album's packaging and rather sparse liner notes. (If this stuff is really as ""big in Europe"" as the compilers claim, I feel sorry for those poor, benighted Europeans...) Devoted fans scouring the shelves for obscurities might wanna check this collection out, but I think it's fairly forgettable. You're much better off picking up the incredible compilations Harmless Records has been putting out recently."
3,A fun cozy mystery,"This was a fun read if you like true cozies with a touch of paranormal. I liked that the ""spirit world"" didn't completely overwhelm the ""normal"" world in this otherwise traditional mystery. Plus, the characters are sympathetic and interesting, if the main character, Emerald, is just a little too strong/capable/good looking/great mom for my tastes in a mystery. She read like a romance heroine, which would be fine if this was a romantic thriller."
4,The Second in the Chintz & China Series,"This book, like the first, has both a paranormal and normal mystery that the main character needs to solve while balancing running her own business, romantic relationships, friendships, and raising two children. This book moves the series along as well. As far as the main character's personal life, this book seems to focus on a transition period.In this book, Emerald only does one tarot reading, for a client who is hit by a hit & run driver after leaving Emerald's shop. He leaves a cursed trinket behind that turns Emerald's life upside down. While bringing back many of the characters from the first book, we meet some new ones as well.The book is well written and very entertaining. I think the first book was better, but this one is definitely worth the read. The book is a little hard to find but worth the effort."
5,Good general-purpose book,"A good general-purpose finance book. Covers pretty much all the bases and is straight-forward.This makes it perfect not only for someone just starting off to make sure they're on the right track, but also for people who are trying to put their finances back in order. Also great for those who may be established but just want to use their money more wisely.If you're really only interested in investment info though, I would suggest buying a different book specifically on the topic."
5,"Great product, fast shipping","The item was exactly as described - in great condition - for a great, low price. Shipping was very fast - the item arrived much sooner than estimated. Great seller."
4,Great book for a simple back routine,"I really liked this book. This book offers simple, yet helpful info about how soft tissue injuries occur and what up can do about it. This focuses primarily on the back and spine so if that is what you need, this book delivers. I have been doing the exercises and find them easy to preform and effective. Many people think that to be effective it has to be really hard and painful or ""advanced"". This is not an advanced program, its the basics. But sometimes the basics bring the most profound results."
1,includes positions hurtful for those with back problems,"I am very disappointed in this book. I bought it specifically because I wanted to continue with Pilates even with two bulging disks. Unfortunately, this book includes positions that my physical therapist said are most stressful on the spine. He said never to use the ""V-shape"" position and that very position appears on several pages of this book. The book includes the basic Pilates exercises that probably contributed to my back injuries in the first place. My therapist had recommended a Pilates class taught by physical therapists. I could not take that class and was hoping this book would be along those same lines. It was not."
5,Great buy.,Keeps you really hot and toasty on those chilly Northern nights. A bargain for the price. Outer covering repels a good amount of moisture (to a point) and roomy. Zipper is high quality and has yet to snag on me.
4,only one problem,This was a gift for my daughter's 10th birthday and she loves it. She likes the fact that the inside feels cotton-y (rather than nylon-y like other sleeping bags). The only problem is that we cannot get it back into the storage sack.
4,Good sleeping bag,"I like it, it has nothing special compared to others but still looks good, and Its fine for the weather of the places I go in DR."
5,Loved it,"I was going to a yoga retreat for a month in the mountains of New Mexico (no, not a cult LOL). I needed something soft/comfy and warm so after some research, I chose this Coleman sleeping bag. I have an old back injury which likes to resurface after sleeping on uncomfortable surfaces so this was a concern. But this bag was soft and not slippery on the inside (I believe it's flannel on the inside). I was warm every morning although the mountains in the morning get chilly. It's slippery on the outside so I imagine that if you are sleeping in a tent with others, you might end up too close to them. But it's warm and large enough where you don't feel restricted in your movement and can actually move your arms and legs around at night. It did not get below 50-55F so I cannot attest as to how it handles colder climates."
1,Re-hash of the Centre of the Earth,This is just a re-release of the sub-standard instrumental re-recorded (not so) Greatest Hits - available in bargain bins everywhere. Avoid
5,Alector's Choice (Book 4 of Corean Chronicles),The story contiues in a a most understanding manner. Given the shift in time line it takes a bit of time to understand the context. Once into the story it moves right along however it does get a bit detailed about material that does not contribute directly to the story line.
3,not quite Fourth...,"good book in classical L.E.Modesit stlye, but first three are much better. It doest have much to do with characters from first three books... fabula is few centuries before first three..."
3,Mike Hammer meets little green men,"This is more of a detective story than SiFi. There is a much lower body count than in most of Drake's books and the aliens were somewhat disapointing. Dispite that,it is a good book.Drake is able to keep you reading with good characters and a fast moving plot. Hardcore Drake fans may be disapointed but I found it a nice change from big battle books he puts out."
5,Perfect for a Busy Mother or Grandmother,"Unfussy, practical, easy to use & to cook from. Down to earth recipes. A whole meal plan in one unit. Side dishes make the meal. Drinks a plus. Anyone can do these meals. A summer grill bonanza. Good for a weekend gift idea."
2,** RIP - OFF !!! **,"this book is ok, but it's a weak ripoff of The Great Big Burger Book, which is also 100 recipes, all kinds of meat and fish, etc but the first one is a much better book, easier to reproduce."
1,Dents during shipment,"I ordered this for my father as a birthday gift to be shipped to him. It arrived dented. It seems that it was shipped with only the type of thin box you might see it in if it were on a store shelf. He had to return it. While he thought it seemed of adequate quality, it didn't survive its shipping."
3,Just OK,"My husband got this for Christmas and even though it looks nice it is not entirely functional. For example: The drawers only open when the top is up, in fact the manufacturer warns not to even attempt to open them without the top open since it damages the chest?! The top itself opens very hard and with three locks you have to have two hands but better would be three really.Otherwise a good looking tool chest with nice compartments. I definitlely do not recommend this chest for anybody who needs to use it more than a few times a year."
4,Very Enjoyable Album,"I have enjoyed listening to this CD over the last four years and decided it was time to tell the world about it. It is rather sad that not many people know about this band. Often with good albums it takes time to appreciate them fully. The vocals are soulful and the songs feature lush strings and strong melodies. The sound is a mixture of folk, soul, and soft rock of the late '60s and early '70s.The musiciship is excellent. The Beauty Room are British and consist of Kirk Degiorgio (producer, keyboards, vocals) and Jinadu (lead vocals, keyboards). Together they wrote most of the songs. The other musicians include guitarist Ian O'Brien, keyboardist Tom O'Grady and drummer Chris Whitten. The Heritage Orchestra provides the strings. The All Music Guide gave this album 4.5 stars."
3,Just ok.....,"If you like the ""British Air"" sound of Zero Seven I'm sure you'll like this as it is not dissimilar. I bought this CD after reading good things about it by an online electronics review magazine. They said the sonics were good too, which they are. All in all though, it doesn't quite measure up to Zero Seven status. You could make a case for the first 6 cuts as smooth easy listening with catchy electronica, but ultimately the album is a bit boring and just fair."
4,solid mix of original material!,"Washington, D.C. band does a good job on it's first, self-produced EP. Couple jam/rockers, some jazzy stuff, radio-friendly reggae and a blues tune to boot."
5,TE ENCULTECES,Y TE DIVIERTES...Muy interesante y lo puedes ir leyendo como se te antoje...SON PUROS PARRAFITOS CORTOS !
2,"Little detail, bad organization, Poor as a reference","If you've never used Vi before, this book will help you to get started. But after the first week, it won't be very useful.I use Vim everyday as a computer programmer, and whenever I need to figure out how to do something, I now just turn to google. The book covers many features of Vim, but in not much detail. The Appendix is sparse and often wrong. And topics are usually scattered in 3 different places in the book.For example, I don't use macros a lot, but I know they are a simple and powerful feature that many Vim users use all the time. Looking up how to use them took me through 2 sections and 15 minues. And the command involes only 2 keys!The first two chapters tell you how to get started in VIM with the basic commands - and its easy enough to follow along with. But the other 28 chapters don't help you get much done at all."
5,send me more books about information technology,i need notes about it and operating system and many more
3,Buyer beware,"My wife and I, recently, rented this unit (or, perhaps, another model, but of the same company) with a car from HERTZ. While being excited about ""smartness"" of the unit during our driving from Washington, D.C. to New Jersey, we were stunned later, when it guided us to a street we wanted to reach in Manhattan. Instead of Manhattan, it brought us to Staten Island to... a street of exactly the same name (Clinton). We were lucky that time of the day was early afternoon and we were able to finally to reach our destination at daylight, using, again, the device. However, at this time we specified intersection of the street we were looking for and of another street in the area. Also, the unit did not recognize one way streets.The conclusion I would make, while using the device, be familiar, in general, with the area and carry a map, as well, just in case. :-)"
4,Good Rock-A- Billy Music,"If you would like to once again hear some of the old sounds that you haven't heard in some time that brings back the good sounds that came out of mainly the Deep South but actually spread over most all the Country, then you will like this album."
5,It all comes down to That Voice,"When the Beatles called Harry Nilsson their favorite group, they weren't kidding. The evidence is right here on ""Harry""...the multitrack vocals, the voice that goes from a dark rumble to a crystal soprano. It's worth hearing.One benefit of this album not having been released on CD with the rest of Harry's catalog is that now we get several excellent bonus tracks; the standout is the extremely rare ""I Will Take You There"" from the obscure movie Skidoo. But every song on this album is beautiful. Harry even does the definitive version of the Beatles' ""Mother Nature's Son"" that blows the original away."
1,No Good,"Essentially this is ACDSee Photo Manager 9 with a few changes. This program isn't worth the time lost and trouble caused. Crashes too frequently and lags the system, it's a resource hog before you even start working. I switched to irfanview and Photoshop Elements to duplicate most of the ""pro"" features listed in this app."
5,My dad was a Korean War POW,"My dad did not share his POW experiences. He was captured Thanksgiving Day 1950; released the last day; one of the last trucks across. This book has allowed me to learn more about the hell he lived through and appreciate the grit it took to make it back home in one piece and live a relatively normal life. It allowed me to figure out which camps he was in and the ""living"" conditions in those camps. A must read for anyone who has a family member who served in Korea and especially anyone who was captured."
3,More of the same,"I have read three of Leah's books now and the advice appears to be the same in each. Whilst on the one hand this means the author is consistent in her advice on what constitutes style and how to attain it affordably, on the other hand there is little new material to pick up from each new book."
1,Outdated,"The drawings and text in this book are really outdated. The authoractually makes reference to the current ""First Lady Nancy Reagan"". No, I am not kidding. Any fashion/style advice you can get from this book would have you looking like it is 1984."
4,Great,Its much brighter than what i expected and no longer have to worry about blackouts. It uses a lot of batteries though.
5,Great light!,"we already own one of these and bought two more after the last blackout. The lantern provides a great deal of light and uses very little battery power - in fact, the one we own still has the batteries we put in it when we first got it 3 years ago.Highly recommended."
1,What were they thinking?,"When I saw the ""surround feature"" of this toaster, I thought ""great, no more unevenly toasted slices of bread"". The surround feature on this toaster closes the top of the toaster to keep the heat inside and in theory, gives evenly toasted breads. Unfortunately, science tells us that HEAT RISES and because this toaster does not let the heat escape, we have uneven toasted bread; burned at the top, and brown at the bottom. This is a horrible toaster, but it looks nice."
1,Pass on this one..,"This appeared to be a bargain that was too good to pass up - the Cuisinart name at a rock-bottom price. Unfortunately, in this case I truly got what I paid for. The toasting was uneven, the heating levels were inconsistent, and the thing was as big as a boat! I've gone back to my old General Electric. Bottom line: It isn't a bargain if it doesn't work."
1,"Looks Good, but that is it!",It stopped working after about a year. We did not feel it was worth the expense to send it back under the warranty.
1,This toaster needs to be reconditioned again,"We got the toaster to give as a gift. The person we gave it to within a month said that it didn't toast evenly, the element didn't heat up all of the way, and it didn't want to stay down. This was the first Cuisinart taht we bought, we thought it was a good name, maybe they should stick to food processors."
2,darkest setting hardly browns,"The toaster needs a minumun of 2 toasting cycles. Am I the only one having this problem? When I put it at the darkest setting, the bread/bagel is still white! I'll put up with it because of the price."
1,Stopped working after 7 months,I bought this toaster 7 months ago. Recently one side no longer heats up.
1,"not a good toaster,should have returned it sooner,bad perfor","This toaster does not toast well on both sides of the bread.We have to repeatedly press it back down several times to get a piece of bread to toast evenly.Only the left side of the toaster works half-decently, we have to swith the slices of bread to the left side to get them toasted properly all the way through.We should have returned this toaster after a few months of using it, but we procrastenated, and we put up with this annoying defect too long.Today the slices of bread kept popping up white, nottoasted, I guess the elements inside are burnt.We have had this toaster only 1 year and 1/2."
5,Love those bagels,"I too thought the clunk when the bagel pops up was a little loud. So many toasters now have a silent pop up, but at least you know it's there! Did 2 bagels (separately) frozen, took 2 cycles on about #3, and they were great! A little crisp on the outside, nice and soft on the inside. Haven't tried toast yet, but I'm sure it will be fine. [$]for a [more money] toaster also was a deal too good to pass up."
1,It's HUGE!,"I haven't tried it out yet, so I can't speak to toasting ability, but my gosh, it's the biggest, ugliest thing I've ever seen. It is nearly a foot and a half long! I live in an apartment and certainly can't take up an entire coutertop with this bad boy. Make sure you look at the picture on your computer screen and imagine it in all of its over-sized glory before you purchase."
5,WOW!!! Flood These Streetz,"One word...DOPE!!! I had slept on this album for quite a while. Recently I took a chance and picked it up. Shane Capone is one of those rare white rappers, unlike Eminem, that doesn't come across so much as corny but very much REAL, and very, very much believable. The hard delieverence in his voice and complete knowledge of his subject matter makes one believe that the majority of his music is from real life experience. To put it simply... ""I was blown away by this album"" and will be shocked if Shane Capone continues to be slept on for very much longer."
4,Great for terrariums,I purchased this product with the intent to use it for a terrium for my succulent plants. Its the perfect high and width. The cover is very sturdy and does not appear to chip around the edges like other glass lids I've encountered.
3,No Seal,"I was going to buy this jar, until I found it in store at the Container Store, and discovered it doesn't have a seal around the lid. My hopes for the perfect flour jar were destroyed! I love this jar, and Anchor makes great quality glass canisters and bake ware, however without a seal around the lid the jar is useless for storing any kind of food item. Anchor needs to seriously consider offering either various sizes of seals for their jars that don't come with them already, or just start making this line with seals. I contacted them about this, and unfortunately they had no suggestions for me. Very disappointing. Keep this in mind when deciding to purchase this line from Anchor. The Hocking line does not come with seals!!"
5,"Great for Flour, Sugar, Powdered Sugar and treats for kids.",I have had these types of jars over the years but the store I had originally purchased them from had closed down 20 years ago and so I went to my favorite store now and sure enough they had them. I bought some more for me and then got my newly married Granddaughter hooked on them. So easy to scoop out whatever baking need you have while you are cooking.
4,2 gal,I bout the same 2gallon glass jar at Target for 13 dollars. I would buy there to save money. Nice gass lid i bought one to store makeup brushes to keep lint and dust off them
4,2 gallon heritage glass jar,Im confused! Is this a 1 gallon jar or a two gallon jar? The title description says 2 gallon but the smaller print description says 1 gallon capacity. It'd be nice to know what the heck Im trying to buy.
5,Great jar,"This jar is great. Very thick glass and seems durable (haven't tested durability yet...hope not to). There is no rubber lip around the edge of the jar, so probably wouldn't use to store food items. It's great for displaying things and looks great filled with various stones that I've had laying around."
5,High Quality Jar Great For Displays,We use these to display product in our stores. These are made with thick glass and are very sturdy.
4,Great product,Bought this one for my uncle's car. I have one just like it with Tinkerbell print. Love it.
2,Disappointed This Avid Norton Fan,"Some of Ms. Norton's collaborations ""click"" and some don't. This one really doesn't. There's the trademark cute and intelligent animals, the wisewoman (wysen-wyf, a title that kept giving me a mental image of one of those dried apple dolls), the Sulcar--uh, Sea-Rovers, and some palace intigue. But honestly there was too much happening and the authors did not draw it all together. The book lacked a sense of ""place"" which never happened with Witch World. It was very hard to get a sense of when the actions were occurring in relation to one another. And none of characters seem to come into focus.I really had to push myself to finish this book, which has never happened with a book that Ms. Norton has done alone, and I really don't care what happens in the rest of the proposed series.Guess I'll just have to wait for the second Edgehill/Norton book due out this month. I thought Shadow of Albion was a real feast and I'm eagerly awaiting the next one."
2,Setting the stage,"The book had a LOT of potential but didn't really fulfill any of it. The reader is left completely unsatisfied that anything productive has been done minus that the stage has been set for (hopefully) a sequel in which there will be some actual ACTION. I found it very frustrating that the authors had three different threads of events going on and didn't weave them together into any kind of conclusion. Instead, the book is basically bringing those three threads together. End of story. Nothing resolved. I wouldn't buy this book until a sequel is published and the sequel has been determined to actually DO something. Only then will this book be worthwhile for background."
2,Norton or Miller? That is the question.,"By the end of the first chapter I wondered who was writing the book, not the usual Norton. Story line vague, characters introduced scantily, changed scenes too quickly, and the ending....never in Norton style. The little animals and bird kept the story moving slowly. Not sure I'll read the 2nd one."
3,Somewhat disjointed and incomplete,"While the story is interesting and the characters are well developed, the story skips about between characters and scenes, and goes forward and backward in time. It would have been helpful if the action had been in a continuous chronology. It can become a little confusing as to exactly where you are in the story. The story ends abruptly on page 320 without coming to a real conclusion. The book seems to have been written to develop the scene and the characters for a later sequel."
2,this book was below boring,"I heard that andre norton was a very good author and I thought that maybe I could read a book and see how it went. I was very, very sad to find out that the book was a let down. Yeah, sure it used big words, but it was boring. There was no deepth and it felt like I was reading some boring non-fiction book. Whatever you do, don't read this book because you are going to have wasted your time. Instead read Daughter of the Forest by Juliet Marillier. Then you'll have a good time. Beware of To the King a Daughter!!!!!!!"
4,2001 Sierra C3,"These were a good fit and easy install, they gave a fairly different look that i liked on my black truck. Quality seems good or avg and they work with stock bulbs and harness."
1,Not for early primary grades,"I purchased this video for my daughter to use in her first grade class. This was way over their heads. This needs to be rated for upper elementary grades who I am not sure actually study Johnny Appleseed. I will probably donate it to the school or sell it, what a disappointment."
1,Farce not fable,"The product description of ""classic American folk tale"" might lead one to believe that this movie is the legend of Johnny Appleseed, when in fact, it is not based on the legend nor on the factual life of Johnny Chapman. It is instead, a farcical adaptation that, even with the great talents of Martin Short and Rob Reiner, falls short of funny. I was hoping for something entertaining and educational for my young grandchildren, but this film was neither. I ordered Walt Disney's MELODY TIME at the same time and can recommend its short classic, LEGEND OF JOHNNY APPLESEED."
5,Simply Awesome,I loved these growing up and recently got them on a trip to Canada. They are as good as I remember and bought quite a few. But now they are all gone and I want more. Why don't they sell them here in the USA? I want more!
5,The candy bar that evokes childhood memories,This is a wonderful taste treat that is not to be comapred with anything in the US. My aunt used to send it to us for Christmas every year. She is gone now but the product thankfully is not. Thanks to O Canada I can carry on her tradition and be reminded of my childhood. It is great with a good book.!! You will want to Eat-More
5,His best work,"Although Silver Apples Of The Moon/The Wild Bull is a classic, Sidewinder/Until Spring is the best. It's more nuanced and subtle than Silver Apples and has a more fluid composition overall. After listening to Sidewinder/Until Spring, I'm left wondering what makes Autechre and Aphex Twin so special since the ""IDM/glitch"" thing they do is really not new at all. Composers like Subotnick(or Varese) take a much more conceptual and lyrical approach to their music, giving the pieces a life of their own, unlike IDM artists who just see how much they can degrade and resequence a sound file using Reaktor software. Believe me, there is a lyricism to true electronic music that most electronic artists today totally miss, and Subotnick hits it right on the dot!"
5,An Inspired New Artist,"I discovered Jessica Bailiff through her appearance on Kranky's ""Clear Horizons"" disc with Flying Saucer Attack's David Pearce. And I'm very glad I did. She and Pearce both seem to be inspired by the same muse. Beautiful, but vaguely unsettling, drones, recurring controlled feedback that somehow remains part of the overall hushed quality of the music, with the occasional acoustic guitar and Jessica's fragile, delicate voice are intoxicating. Beauty is beautiful, but it's a little scary too, in other words. If you like all things Flying Saucer Attack, you'll love this, although it should be emphasized that Jessica Bailiff is an excellent artist in her own right. Her other two albums are great too, although her first is more in this style than her rather more sparse, self-titled third album. I have all three and wouldn't want to be without any of them."
5,A Very Nice Volume,"This miniature edition of the New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs is a very solid little volume. Though it fits in a shirt pocket, the typeface is quite legible. The red-letter Gospels and the Epistles are in a two column format, while the Psalms and Proverbs are in a whole page format. It's leather bound and is sewn, so it looks to be a durable book.While it is true that the text is sometimes placed a little high on the page, making the top and bottom margins somewhat variable, this is surely a minor problem."
3,ESV needs a publisher!,"The ESV is an excellent translation, as noted in several reviews including my own. My low score here is reflective of the printing quality and other publication issues. (I don't know how the translators got hooked up with Crossway. If only Zondervan or another large publisher had gotten the contract, ESV could be on the map by now.)First the quality of the page set is second class. Just look at a few pages and note that the margins vary from page to page, from top to bottom; it looks unprofessional.Second, it is too expensive ($...) for a small pocket NT. Holman has superior quality leather New Testaments at almost half the price.Third, the SlimLine NT design used by many is a superior shape, fits better into the pocket (the ESV NT is a 5"" x 3"" little box shape) and the SlimLine has superior print size and layout. The print in the ESV NT is minute.A chain is only as strong as its weakest link: ESV needs quality publication to achieve the status it deserves."
3,falling apart,"I am very pleased with the quality of the translation, but within several uses the binding was falling apart of this new Bible"
1,Wrong Grill,"This part was supposed to fit the driver's side of my Nissan pickup, but it actually was made for the passenger side. The illustration shows the correct part, unfortunately that's not what got shipped to me. Amazon refunded my money instantly, but I'd rather be in possession of the correct part."
3,Crazy contraption,"It seems they designed this thing upside-down. We actually mounted ours upside down because if mounted the ""correct"" way you will have a 75 pound tv hanging on 2 tiny little screws. But it was cheap so I can't complain that the designers design things upside-down."
4,Nothing beats a homemade greeting card,"For years I have used photos and some catchy comments to personalize my greeting cards. I use them for everything from congratulations to birthday wishes.The Hallmark product is a great package that contains both high quality blank, inkjet-ready card stock and envelopes.Though I haven't use Hallmarks software to layout the cards, it probaby works nicely. Both PrintShop and Microsoft Publisher do an excellent job. I simply save my old layouts and change them for my new cards. Then do a ""Save As"" to archive the card in my files.It's cost effective and far more personal to design and print your own cards for family and friends. The Hallmark product makes the process easy."
2,Poor Quality Card Stock,"This is a very cheap card and envelope set. The card stock is about half the weight of standard stock, and the envelopes so thin you can see through them. I was hugely disappointed and ended up buying other stock for my project, though I did use the envelopes since on my budget I had no choice."
5,PERFECT CARD STOCK FOR HALLMARK SOFTWARE!!,WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT MY HALLMARK CARDMAKER DELUXE 2006 SOFTWARE I BOUGHT THIS TYPE OF STOCK PAPER. THEN IT RAN OUT ON THEIR WEBSITE! I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED. WHEN I FOUND IT AT AMAZON.COM I WAS THRILLED AND AM STILL USING IT! PERFECT SIZE FOR THAT PERFECT CARD! I USE THIS SIZE THE MOST OF ALL FOR MY CARDS WHICH I MAKE! TRY IT!!!
4,"pretty good, but hard to feed",The cards print fold well and show good color for a matte finish. But for some reason they have a very hard time feeding in my Epson printer. I have to help them one sheet at a time.
5,Hallmark Blank Greeting Cards,"This premium quality 85# matte blank greeting card product produced stunningly beautiful, brilliant and crisp text and graphic images using my injet printer. I have tried similar products, but Hallmark clearly stands out among its competitors.The product is economically priced and you receive a bonus trial edition Hallmark Card Studio software CD, which makes this deal hard to beat."
2,Paper jams,"I could only get this paper to feed correctly through my HP 7310 inkjet printer about 50% of the time, thereby causing me to go through an awful lot of paper... even after cleaning my printer. I much prefer the Hallmark Traditional Card size, which doesn't appear to be available anymore, and didn't give me nearly as much trouble as this paper. Plus, after printing, the card just didn't look as nice. It didn't stand as straight up as straight as the previous Hallmark card stock... I'm not sure that the other was thicker or anything, it just seemed less flimsy. For the cards that did print, the ink saturation looked good though."
1,Decreased quality,"This is the second pack of IDENTICAL Hallmark cards. They are IDENTICAL boxes - 85lb (per box label), but clearly the second pack is a lighter weight card, it feels too flimsy. I bought the first box about 1.5 yrs ago. I will not buy these again, as I would be just as well off buying heavy 8x10 stock paper from the art store. Someone at Hallmark should be embarrassed."
5,The Pentagon Papers are the headwaters of today's politics,"This book adds greatly to the vastly inadequate body of literature about the Pentagon Papers Affair. It asks Who is Daniel Ellsberg ? Ellsberg is the one most associated with the Pentagon Papers but others played roles just as important or moreso. Wells interviews 237 friends , family, colleagues, government officials, scholars and Watergate characters to draw his immensely detailed portrait of Ellsberg. In no way is this overkill because the Ellsberg personality is so inflated it needs to be brought to earth. Wells does this artfully in this psychiatric tour de force, a fascinating must-read for all who seek the truth about this critically important piece of history."
1,Slanted View,"Daniel Ellsberg risked 125 years in prison for leaking the Pentagon papers. As a psychiatrist, I can tell you that narcissists never put themselves in that much risk."
2,Overrated.,"If you're a big Jane's fan, this is definitely worth seeing. At the same time, overall it's not that interesting. I bought this in 1993 when my love for Jane's was at its highest, and I was quite disappointed.On the plus side, it was nice to see footage of Perry and Casey hanging out. And there's some cool live Jane's performances. That Harry Perry guy on rollerskates. Ice-T jams with Perry over the end credits. And there's an awesome John Frusciante track.The bad stuff? Dull camerawork, some bad acting, lame humor (the pizza delivery guy, the doctor's receptionist, singing telegram). Parts of this movie are so amateurish it's hard to sit through.If you're not a Jane's fan, stay away from this film. If you are a fan, you might find it worth your time. And if you are obsessed with Perry your opinion may fail to be objective, resulting in embarrassing statements like ""best film of the '90s"" or ""a masterpiece!""."
4,present yourself with Gift,"If you love the music of Perry Farrell and Jane's Addiction, then this is a must see.If you are not so familiar with the lively tunes of this early 1990s band I believe that you will still enjoy this film with its low budget quirkiness and realism.I highly recommend this movie to mature viewers only. There are explicit scenes of drug dealing and use. I admire Perry Farrell for not glorifying the use of the depicted Class A's. Although he does seem to demonstrate the ""how to's"" quite clearly while capturing the essence of the ritual of an addict.The music is fab, scenes of live performances are mixed in with the movie.You'll be touched by the emotion, intrigued by the spiritualism, excited by the band and amused by the subtle humour of life from Perry and Casey's perspective."
2,A Sad Gift,"This movie doesn't stand the test of time - if it weren't for the concert footage, it would be virtually unwatchable.I was hugely into Jane's Addiction back in the olden days, and their music is still perhaps the most important creative achievement in alt rock. ""Nevermind"" never would have happened without ""Nothing's Shocking.""But the story part of this movie is just a drug-addled, self-indulgent load of tripe. I'd much rather see all the performances together and then have the option of watching the mistakenly artsy story scenes.I'll still listen to their first three albums religiously, but I won't ever open this Gift again."
1,leave it,We left the book in San Francisco in the hotel room. Potentially the next visitorswould be interested in this local history. We found the prose to be less than stellarand the topic could have been presented differently.
4,"Great book, but with some errors","This book is so fantastic! But it has some errors. We Korean say, ""dirt on diamond'. First of all, in p68, there are wrong photomicrographs about muscle types. 2nd one is of skeletal muscle, not cardiac muscle as typed in this book. And third one is of cardiac muscle, not visceral or smooth muscle. But still I really love this book as a professor of anatomy."
3,Maestro Moose,"Plush Maestro Moose Puppet 10"" (Purchased on 09/18/2007)Even though I loved the idea of this puppet, there are two problems:1. It does not fit an adult hand to operate the mouth (which is why I purchased this particular puppet -- it had a moving mouth)2. Quality control messed up -- one antler will not stand up so it kind of takes away from the moose thing -- it's definitely mis-sewnBecause it was an inexpensive puppet, I didn't bother to return it, and I won't bother to buy another one.Thank you."
5,COMING FULL CIRCLE,"review from Magical Blend magazine (US) ""NOMAD (aka Adam Plack) lived, wrote and recorded this phenomenal work under the skies of the Ramingining community in Arnhem Land. It's all about sultry grooves, entrancing Tribal beats and snake-charming didgeridoo laced with exotic chants of Aboriginal Dreamtime. This is one of the most interesting pieces of musical artist I've ventured through recently. This story is enchanting...the music comes from the Ramingining and was composed by merging ancient beats with the sounds of the Australian landscape. It is full of modern pathos and ancient chant. Listening reminds me that life is a cycle and we come ""full circle"" in the end."" MARA BENSON, MAGICAL BLEND"
3,"On The brink of the Forest, but not too Deep.","Nomad ~ Songman starts out as a really great ride with aborigines tones and Deep Forest-like qualities, but ends up a blank emotion. I'm not saying it is a terrible album, I am just saying listen with patience ... It's a fair album with some really great songs as well as some snoozers."
5,FABULOUS!,"My favorite power flosser was chewed up by my puppy and I could not find another one anywhere. I was panicked because I'm an obsessive flosser, BUT I CANNOT floss with manual floss, it's just too awkward and tedious! I came across this one and decided to try. This flosser is FAR superior to the one I was using (and I liked that one!) and it makes flossing so easy. You can REACH all your teeth even way to the back, and it gently slides between the tighter ones. The cartridge STAYS ON, which was a problem I had with my other model that I just dealt with. A great surprise! Very well made, and ready to go with battery! So glad I bought a 3-pack, now I have extras if my puppy HAPPENS to get it again (not likely!), I was lost without my power flosser! This one is even better, so I'm GLAD this happened now. I do hope the cartridges are readily available, they are WELL worth the cost, this product makes flossing easy and feels good too! Thank you!"
5,Flossing made easy,"Since I began using this flosser, my dentist has been impressed. My teeth are very close together and this allows me to floss easily."
2,Reach Access,"My item was delievered quickly and I didn't have a problem with the seller but the item itself was disappointing. In a pack of 3, one worked, one didn't and one only works marginally well. I can't find these in the store anymore and I really liked the one I had so I oredered it online. I was disappointed in the performance of the product."
5,Excellent product,"Flossing was too difficult, too time-consuming, and often painful (the floss always cut into and caused blisters in my fingers) until this excellent product came along. The only problem I've had with it is that, lately, it's been difficult to find in stores that used to stock it. I hope this isn't a harbinger of a phase-out. My hygienist is very impressed with my dental hygiene in the three years I've used it, and has recommended it to other patients who hate flossing."
1,Don't bother,I tried to install this software on a system running Windows XP. I never did get it to work.
3,Keep Looking,"Graphics and sounds are simple and repetetive. The games are simple and not that interesting. The games become boring very quickly (even for a 6 year old). The levels do not adjust themselves to the player skills. The built in help is fairly good, but sometimes the audio playback didn't."
1,How did this get all those stars??,"My daughter sat down to use this software and was immediately almost lost. I figured I would give it a whirl so maybe I could help her. Well, I found it basically unintelligible...and this is from someone north of forty who is fairly computer literate. I am donating this to some worthy cause........I am sorry it's too late to return it. I wouldn't give it any stars if the program allowed for that option!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Lively!,Lively fun! A twist on Celtic with a lot of rock. Great for St. Paddy's parties! If you're not sure-you need to listen again!!!
5,The funniest thing out of Canada,"I loved the first season of this series. It beats ""The Office"" for satire. Well worth renting or buying."
1,not a good nic,This nic would not work in a system that has a realtek nic that failed. The drivers that come with the startech nic are for a realtek nic. In a Win7 64 bit environment this card simply does not function.
4,Good Upgrade for an older PC,"Bought this Gig-E card about a month ago for a WinXP computer (Intel D945GTP with Pentium 4), which was cleaned up for service as a network storage device. Data transfers with this card met my expectations for speed. However, at first it wouldn't let the computer go into standby. I tried the on-line forums, drivers, and every possible setting in Windows, but could not get the computer to go to sleep. When I pulled the card and went back to the motherboard's 100 Mbps port, everything returned to normal - it went to sleep and woke up on network requests. [Update 7/16/2011] The Tech Team at Startech suggested that I change the PCI port, which I did and the Gig-E card now operates correctly."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Everywhere it says it is a PCI card - even on the box itself. Once I looked at the picture on the box, and later the card, I realized that this was not the case.THIS CARD ONLY FITS IN A PCI-E (PCI-Express) SLOT! Now, I must admit, it is a good price for a card, but I don't have any open PCI-E slots (only PCI) so it is therefore useless to me.Be sure to have a PCI-E slot open before you order!"
5,great price and works great,"Cannot complain... these were priced right and they work great. Windows 7 recognized them instantly. If you need gigabit ethernet on a PCI bus, these will do the trick."
3,10/100/1000 Card,They did not fit some cases and the cat 5 cable did not fit. When they did fit they worked fine.
5,Absolutely engaging!,"Entertaining from beginning to end! It is like watching an independent and very fresh movie.I have never been to L.A., in fact, I have never been to the United States(yet I managed to put my hands on this book),but now I am curious about that Tempo place here so often described, even though a friend of mine who has been there first-hand insists that I have not missed a thing at all, hinting that the place is picturesque because the guys dance Tex-mix with cowboy hats on, but that everything else is average if not below...But after reading this book it is hard to believe my friend: the gay scene here described is colorful and universal enough-Since some of its characters act and react like many people in the western gay world would;I wish I were there someday jumping to all those cholo dances.This book is fast-paced and it will keep you hooked all the time.Recommended? Yeah! I hope to see a movie out of this some day."
5,A great read from start to finish.,I really enjoyed reading this book. Frederick Smith reminds me E. Lynn Harris and Jame Earl Hardy. You get really involved with the characters and even been to not a like a few of them at times. I brings you into the L.A. gay scene for African and Latin American males. I must read for any native of Los Angeles like myself.
4,Nice leather.. wonderful feel...,"This case is made of... a very nice leather.. that has a wonderful feel to it.It is a bit small for carrying a laptop, but if you are carrying just a notebook or a few files/papers you are good to go.The long strap is comfortable for shoulder toting; and the handle is very nicely stitched on very convenient. Thereare a lot of pockets inside and the outside zipper makes it nice for ease of throwing in the cell phoneor keys when on the go. It is a great briefcase."
3,Winnie is sooo cute!,"I had purchased this for my son last Christmas for a Friday deal here. I paid so little that I wanted to give it a try.It is very cute and Winnie talks through the music as he walks with his pop along toy. One negative is that he head is a bit heavy and he ends up on it pretty often. Joshy did get a kick out of it the first few times and then forgot it. I thought it was cute, but I don't think I will be playing with it! LOL If you find it cheap, then snatch it up. had purchased for 8 dollars; it was worth that much."
3,Reasonably satisfied,My 2 toddlers loved this pooh. They love squeezing the ear and seeing pooh go. Unfortunately our 1st pooh only lasted 6 months. But they loved it so much that we bought them another one.
2,not for ferrets,I would give it a 4 star except i bought it for my ferret and the lining got clawed and pulled out.so i wish sherpa would make one with the car safety parts in it and make one that is Ferret friendly. I finally had to stop using it.
3,Good but not great,I was hoping for more of the lush sounds that I associated with the Casa Loma orchestra in my youth.
4,Coleman sleeping bag,I purchased this sleeping bag a few years ago and it has been a good practical sleeping bag. I use it a couple times a year and it works well for Florida temps.
4,Very comfortable,"Great bag--very comfortable. Not too warm and not too cold. One downside is that I wish it was a bit wider, it was a little cramped inside the bag with my body pillow. Would definitely recommend this bag however."
4,nice sleeping bag for the money,"My wife and daugters get cold easily, and after camping this weekend in northern Minnesota with temps that dipped into the mid 40s at night, they said they didn't get cold and that says alot. The bags roll up easy and aer pretty compact. They are an ugly color, but that obviously has nothing to do with the performance. I would recommend these for any family looking for a decent, relatively warm, and affordable sleeping bag."
5,Amigas y Rivales CD,"This CD is the Soundtrack for the Telenovela ""Amigas y Rivales"" (Angélica Vale, Arath de la Torre, Ludwika Paleta, Adamari López, Johnny Lozada, Michelle Vieth, Etc.). It has 10 tracks, totaling 37:14 minutes. It includes the theme song by Kabah, 3 songs by Angélica Vale (Played Nayeli), 2 songs by Johnny Lozada (ex-Menudo member, played Johnny), and the song ""Al Ataque Feo"" that was the theme for ""El Feo""/Ulises (played by Gabriel Soto). Here is the track listing:1) Amigas y Rivales - Kabah (4:09)2) Entre Amigas - Johnny Lozada (3:18)3) Vuelvo a Intentar - Angélica Vale (4:06)4) No Sabes Cuanto - Alex Sirvent (3:39)5) Amigas y Rivales - Alex Sirvent (3:05)6) Que Paso - Johnny Lozada (3:57)7) Vuelvo a Intentar (Version Merengue) - Angélica Vale (3:48)8) Ellas - Alex Sirvent (3:54)9) Amigas y Rivales - Angélica Vale (3:35)10) Al Ataque Feo - Alex Sirvent (3:14)"
3,Not Very Useful,"This book is full of good ideas, but the necessary graphics for the projectscan only be accessed by students of the design school who have access to a special code.Without is you can only review the projects, then try to come up with graphics of yourown for the tutorials.Overall, not worth the almost $40 that I paid for it!!! The description should have stated that the required code would not be available.Also, I received the book without so much as a slip of paper or sales receipt from the book store I bought it from."
2,Portfolio builder? Not@,"This book sounds better than it is. Your get a web site that you are supposed to be able to download projects and then put on the site to get feed back and see other students work. When you get to the site, they are trying to sell you the book and let you read a chapter on the site. I wanted to use it to create a portfolio so I could start my job search. This was a waste of money. I still don't have a portfolio and no help with creating one!!I greatly disappointed and upset!!!!!"
1,"Warning, Only for 13"" and smaller tires.","Mine are on they're way back. Only 13"" tires. What kind of car will that work on???Need to update the specs on the item so you know what you are getting."
5,tie downs,"These tie downs work great, I use them to tie my ATV down to my trailer,took it for a test drive and the ATV did not move, great product."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"I bought a set of these for my bedroom. I loved them... for about a week. Then I started having a problem turning one on. It would stop turning. I had to turn the bulb manually toit turn on and off. I contacted the company I bought them from and they shipped a replacement. 2 weeks later the second one that I had first bought started doing the same thing. I exchanged that one also. About 6 weeks later my first replacement started doing it too! I talked to the company I bought them from & they created a report of the repeated defect. At this point I am tired of shipping and returning defective lamps. I now have one that is suffering from the problem and I am just ready to get a pair by another company. The headaches these ones are costing me are not worth the price of a new set!Until the company acknowledges this defect and fixes it, I would not even think about buiying their products."
1,"Inaccurate information written by unqualified author, caveat emptor.","I've read other material by Michael Valentine Smith (free PDF articles that he's published online) and the information he presents is a mixed bag. Some information is accurate but there also seems to be an equal amount of erroneous data (for the novice psychedelic researcher this will prove frustrating!) Complicating matters further is the lack of evidential references to support his claims. An excellent scientific article written on the topic of psychedelics (with plenty of references but no how-to's to make the drugs) is ""Hallucinogens"" by David E. Nichols ([...])If you want to know how to synthesize stuff buy or download (you can find torrents for this) PiHKAL and TiHKAL or check [...]. Best of luck on all future endeavors to all psychonauts around the world :)"
1,"A largely irrelevant, outdated ""underground"" publication...","One of the first and most famous of the ""underground"" publications dealing with clandestine synthesis of LSD, et al. Largely journal entries that have been copied over verbatim from journal articles. Legal information is extremely outdated and many ""recipes"" contain dangerous typos a la the Anarchist's Cookbook that will most likely lead to failure of synthesis or death of the chemist if actually attempted."
1,Worthless,"Probably the worst chemistry book I have ever read. The book flirts between pure academic research (not a useful how to manual) and the issues with these drugs.If the writer has a chemistry degree he ought to renounce his degree. If we doesn't, he has no business writing this book for instructional purposes. I am a chemical engineer and found the processes as described extremely technical and wordy."
2,Largely just copies of academic journal articles,"Text contains several typos that will lead to creating complete poison (at best) or certain death of the chemist (at worst.) The entire ""book"" consists mainly of articles copied straight out of journal articles. The legal procedures are outdated, the information inaccurate, and generally inapplicable to anyone with more than just a benign curiosity in the subject material."
4,Entertaining and informative,I have been a Dr Karl fan for years. This is the first book of his I have bought in recent years and it was quite entertaining although I felt it was aimed at a younger audience which became a bit frustrating at times.
5,Excellent,This is the best phrasal verbs dictionary that you can find on line!!Very recomended you dont regret!!!
2,Not worth the expense.,"Programming books have two uses: to teach you and as a reference. This book does an adequate job of teaching, but I'd say that ""How to Think Like a Computer Scientist"" does better, and you can just look at it on the website. The index is lousy, which makes it hard to find things, and it doesn't cover enough material to make it useful. I wish I'd just bought two copies of Python in a Nutshell instead."
4,"""Learning Python"" is right","The title of this book says it all: ""Learning Python"" is a great book to read if you want to learn Python. Granted, Python is not the hardest language in the world to learn, and I'm not sure that this book goes into enough detail about Python's trickier features (generators, anonymous functions, etc.). Still, I was able to sit down, read this book, work through the examples, and walk away feeling like I really knew how to develop software in Python. Most learn-a-language books are too dense for you to learn the language from the book alone, but ""Learning Python"" definitely made it as easy as possible."
2,Out of date now,"Python has come a long way. This book does not instruct you on any of the newest features or capabilities.If it was to be updated and written in a simpler to follow style...I would recommend it. Until then, I highly suggest you find another beginner book."
4,Great,"I am new to Python and really, really like this book. I have read it cover to cover twice. It is obviously biased in favour of Python, but goes out of its way to explain the ""gotchas"" and things that are not intuitive. All in all, a WAY above average computer book!"
4,Thorough but demanding,"Thorough, rigorous, comprehensive, but unless you are a seasoned programmer Learning Python will be a demanding reading."
1,Kill your curiosity with this one,very bad book... do not use this book if youre starting programming or python. the first chapter itself will put you off completely. try instead beginning python by Magnus Lie Hetland. its simple practical and downright fun.
2,Not for beginners...,"This book bills itself as a book for beginners to programming but actually it's for experienced C programmers who are making the transition to Python. Someone with little coding experience will quickly get discouraged due to all the poorly explained terminology and constant references to C. Also, the pattern of the book is to give an introductory chapter on basic concepts then two or three chapters that get into extremely detailed explanations. At the end of one of those mind-numbing journeys through obscure details, the author will often will often say something like ""But I would suggest you avoid doing this because..."" Huh? Then why even bother to explain it? I can't believe Python is as dense and involved as this book makes it. If the authors would only spend as much time on simple, logical explanations as they do on explaining why Python is superior to every other programming language on the planet, this book might be useful."
4,quirky switch or bulb upon opening,"I received this item in perfect condition as far as I could tell, however the lantern would not turn on right away. I removed and replaced the batteries probably 6 or 7 times before the light finally turned on. I don't know if maybe the bulb needed to ""settle"" for a while after shipping, but it did cause me a bit of a fright at first. If you have the same problem, set the lantern aside for 20 minutes or so then try again before giving up."
5,Very nice,"Easy and safe to use, provides difuse light you can read by unlike a flashlight, durable and easy to carry"
3,Description did not specify size. Not as big as expected.,"The lantern is actually smaller than I excepted, but aside from that, it's good. We have a Coleman lantern that is much larger. Ordered theses for our kids and were disappointed they are not the same size as the one we have."
3,Nice Lantern While It Worked,"From the outside, this is a great lantern. The plactic is of high quality, the light is bright, and the wieght is good. However, mine didn't seem to last. I put maybe 1/2 an hour on it and then I put it away for the winter. A few months later, it won't work. I but in new batteries and all but nothing seems to happen. I don't know if I was just an unlucky custumer who got a dud or perhaps eletric lanterns arn't very reliable, but you want to choose a better Coleman product. This lantern is the ""base product"" of Coleman lanturns and spending a few extra bucks would set you better off."
4,Everyone needs one!,This is a lifesaver when the lights go out. Easy to operate. Puts out a tremendous amount of light. I have one in every room!
5,Excellent for times in need!,"We purchased two for emergencies! We just had Hurricanes twice here in MD in 2011 and 2012. In 2012, our electricity was our for 18 hours. We tried surviving by candles and our birds had no light or warmth. We purchased two of these: one for my husband and I and one for the bird room. It's better than sitting around with candles and walking around with flashlights.Hopefully we won't have any problems. It's great to have these for emergencies! And now the birds will have light in their room and warmth!"
2,Would look elsewhere for emergency lighting source,I expected much more light than it puts out. Initial installation of the D cell batteries required bending of the inside prongs.
1,"latern is made from cheap plastic, not the same like it used to be","This Coleman lantern is made in china from some cheap plastic, hope it's not toxic. Anyway, why have two settings, you can't tell the difference between the two. Coleman does not make lanterns like they used to anymore. I could probably pick up one similar from a nearby sweetmeat for less than 10 buck."
5,Coleman Makes A Good Lantern.,"I've had a Coleman Personal Lantern for about ten years now. It's very similar to this model, except that the glass is shaped slightly differently (the glass in mine is not curved in an up-and-down way, it's a curved cylinder. I've used it almost entirely for camping and it has been stored for long periods of time. It's been a quite good lantern but I'm now thinking of replacing it. My lantern uses fluorescent lighting and 6 D-cell batteries. I have nothing against that, except that I think the more modern LED lighting would be better light and more battery efficient. In any case, Coleman makes a good lantern and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another of this brand.Gary Peterson"
4,Pretty Good Light for Battery Lantern,"We purchased this to get us through Hurricane Sandy. Used it 3-4 hours at night when moving around the house and in bedroom. It worked well, had to replace the batteries once in the 5 days we were without main power. Created enough light to act as bedside lamp. But not enough to read a lot of material. Couldn't tell a great deal of difference between low and high brightness. Would recommend over 90% of the battery systems out there. Stock lots of D batteries."
2,Not reliable,"I purchased this lantern about 2 years ago for a camping trip. It worked as expected and received very light use. I stored it safely away in the original packaging. Fast forward to today (2012) and an impending hurricane on it's way to NY. The battery pack lights up green ( indicating a full charge) when trying to charge it, but the lamp won't turn on when not plugged in to the wall. I recommend you seek out better products from brands that won't let you down when you need them."
3,Let there be light,"I received this lantern in a timely manner. It was as large as I thought it would be. The light is like having a T.V. on in a room when it is dark. Not bad, but I may get another one so the darkness can be brighter. Thanks"
5,Great lantern for emergency,"I bough this lantern when I was living in Florida and suffered a bunch of power outages. It it light, real bright, and it works great. The batteries last long.This is a good lantern to have to be able to go around the house, read a little, cook a sandwish... This lantern really fit the bill for an emergency light."
2,VERY LIMITED - LIGHT RUN TIME.,"HELLO PEOPLE,I believe that what is in ""Writing/print"" on the merchandise box ""should be Accurate."" This Coleman lantern is made durable, and for the most part provides acceptable lighting. However, I found that the designated run time, and the actual to be as different as Night and Day ! USING 2 SETS OF BRAND NEW AKALINE EVERYREADY BATTERIES ...I set out to ""Test the constant run time of this lantern."" To my Surprise, the lantern batteries went Dead just between 4 and 4 1/2 hrs. of constant run time ! This would only be apx. 1/4 to 1/3 RUN-TIME ....COMPARED TO THE FINE PRINT ON THE COLEMAN MERCHANDISE BOX !Just like the OLD saying goes: WHAT YOU SEE ~ IS WHAT YOU GET. THEN WHAT IS IN PRINT ~ IS WHAT IT DOES.Had I only known the Truth about the actual lighting time, then I would have Passed on this lantern.Regards, James."
5,A little light for dark places,"A few weeks ago, I bought this little lantern to provide light in dark places. I liked it so much, I just purchased another. How's that for a recommendation?. :)Jack"
4,Coleman,"I bought this lantern to use when the electricity goes off. It is very sturdy and works fine. But, it is not quite as bright as I had hoped. Overall, I am satified with the quality of the product and will probably buy a Coleman lantern that uses eight batteries. That might be better suited to my purposes. Amazon shipped it fast which is always appreciated."
2,Disappointed,"This ""rugged"" lantern arrived with scratches in the plastic bulb enclosure. The scratched area is about the size of a quarter. This ""rugged"" lantern seems pretty flimsy to me. Coleman appears to be unworthy of its past reputation."
4,I won't be in the dark.,I got this lantern just in case we have another storm and our power goes out. Works fine takes 4 D cell batteries.
4,adequate,Shines brighter than i expected. I keep as back up for hurricanes that cross my part of sunny florida!
3,Lantern,"I was able to use it to see in my apartment during a storm and to read some if I held it close to a book. It seemed to bea bit smaller than depicted in the picture, but a couple of them would be good for outdoor picnics at night."
4,Gift,Given as a gift for a 12 yr old who wanted it for the storm. It has not been used yet. What could be wrong with a Coleman lantern?
4,The light is a little sharp,It's good. It's exactly what you see in the picture. My problem is that the lamp inside hasa very sharp light. I prefer not to look at it directly but it gives you a very good light. Almostlights up a whole room or bathroom and lasts long enough. It is also cool and nice.
4,"Rock, Pop and Opera","The album opens with Keys of Life, a lovely mix of twittering electronics and Nomi's soprano chant. His vocal range is beautifully demonstrated on Lightning Strikes where it switches to falsetto on the refrain, and on The Twist, a soulful, atmospheric number ending in squalls of manic laughter. Nomi Song has a catchy hook, lovely synth lines and snatches of rousing choral vocals, while The Cold Song is an impressive operatic piece and Total Eclipse is a magical blend of rock and classical music. The highlight of the album is the Saint Saens composition Samson and Delilah, sensitively interpreted by Nomi over the most inspired instrumentation, a listening experience that leaves you breathless before it ends with an explosion of electronic noise. This unique album is a successful marriage of rock, pop and various classical styles."

This unique album is a successful marriage of rock, pop and various classical styles."
2,Klaus Nomi - self-titled (BMG Japan),"Originally released in 1982, this was the super-strange-o artist's first of just two albums. He passed on in 1983. What prompted me to look this artist up,was that I saw a performance clip from him on the 'Urgh-A Music War' video. Had seen his ""Total Eclipse"" song on late night cable TV before, but I could never figure out who he was. Tunes here that had me thinking, WHAT the...? were ""Keys Of Life"", Nomi's weird remake of the Chubby Checker hit ""The Twist"", the previously mentioned ""Total Eclipse"" and the only track on this CD I actually sort of like, ""Samson And Delilah"". I'm giving this title a two-star rating instead of a one-star because I honestly believe there might've been a point to this record. Just haven't figured it out yet. Really bizarre 'new wave'!"
3,"TRACKS, WE NEED TRACKS","I totally agree with the previous review. More and more I am finding that Amazon.com is NOT providing tracks for CDs unless it's N'sync, BSB, or Britney Spears. You need to get a ball on and start including tracks on ALL of your CDs if you want to do any business. I don't want to have to send an email to Amazon.com everytime I need track info. I can easily go to Tower records here in Dallas and check out the tracks. And while I am there, why don't I just buy it. HMMM!"
4,...,"...By the way, this single is great, solid trance with good female vocals. ""Beautiful"" by the same artist is even better."
1,What a disappointment,"As a long-time Guy Clark fan I was quite excited when I first heard about this video. But what a disappointment, it's a below amateur production in every way, and even the performances are chopped up and talked over. Save your money."
5,DVD extras give me enough songs I like,"There are people in the movie I had never seen before. The big thrill for me is getting to see Townes Van Zandt when he was so young, and a medley of his hit was all he had to be proud of. ""Pancho and Lefty"" sounded great with just his guitar, and his insight that the song was about two Mexican bandits he saw in a TV show two weeks after he wrote the song fits in to the kind of time sequences I associate with his music. It is difficult to realize what like was life when certain things never existed. Then suddenly, there is this."
4,Good advice.,"I mistakenly thought I was rating my purchase transaction, and gave this item a poor review. (I first borrowed the book from the library, then ordered it online).In fact, I have read select chapters of this book, and do recommend it for almost anyone, particularly those who want to make better sense of their father or father figure, their relationship to him, and how all this affects one's own self, work style, and career trajectory, etc."
3,The Father Factor: How Your Father's Legacy Impacts Your Career,"Very interesting if you are looking for the ""why"" in a relationship. Some sections were a little long to comprehend with language that could have been more ""user friendly"". However, it did make me want to highlight certain sentences that were relevant."
1,Please,"Like my title says, just please. This guy is a whack-job. Touching idea, maybe, and carefully written, but that is only because this guy is trying not to show how messed up his own relationships with everyone he interacts with are.I guess the phrase ""those who can't do, teach"" really applies here. Take one look into this author's life to see what a sham the stuff that he's trying to sell in his books really is.If only we could rate 0 stars..."
1,Same old tired cliches - do not bother with this book,"I have read Mr. Mann's journalistic works since the early 90's and I hoped this book would be different. It is not. Mr. Mann continues to use every tired old gay cliche known. This is the type of book you hope no straight people will read because they will come away with such an unrealistic and cliche-ridden view of the gay world. There is nothing new, fresh or invigorating in this dreary book..."
2,Abysmal,"It's not profound enough to be a serious book, and it's not funny or sexy enough to be a fun book. Here are the specific problems:1. The narrator/main character is detestable. He's a self-absorbed, insufferable bore who is never fun to be with.2. The ""wise"" character's wisdom consists of tired, self-help slogans.3. Hardly anything happens!4. Instead of following the maxim of ""Show, don't tell,"" the author tells, then shows, then explains what he's shown. 30% of this book could have been cut with no problem.5. There's no sense of place or setting. A good novel leaves me with a lot of visual imagery. This book felt like disembodied voices speaking in a gray mist.6. Except for the narrator, the other character are lifeless or cliched."
4,self -absorbed protagonist speaks volumes,"While some readers may be put off by Jeff, the self-absorbed protagonist of this beautifully written first novel, others will find it, like I did, to strike a cord. Jeff seems to want it all-his lover Lloyd, the younger trick who turns out to be more, Eduardo, and the nameless men he meets at rest stops and tea dances. That one side of him is balanced by his eagerness explore his options, his psyche and his world. He has genuine love for the three primary men in his life and that love shines through. His relationships with his other family, his mother and father and siblings, are very real and telling. A terrific book that says a great deal about today's Gay world and about emotions and relationships in general."
3,Semi-Literate Gay Soap Opera,"The title of my review says almost all that can be said. In this novel, Mann tries to be a respectable literary writer, but comes a bit short. I have to give him credit, however, for not falling into all of the traps of commercial fiction. The narrator is not a particularly sentimental character, which is a risky move--especially when you consider the majority of Mann's audience is not likely to have been challenged in such a way before. It is this narrator's less-than-loveable characteristics that make this novel, at times, a biting commentary on the values of many modern gay men--that is to say, sex and selfishness."
3,From Back Cover,"Entertaining the spinster aunt of his buddy's flighty fiancee is a chore for Jake Johnson. Except ""Aunty"" - E'izabeth Comstock - is actually a thirty-year-old knockout with long chestnut hair... and a body that would stop a stampede! Who could blame the footloose cowboy for trying to charm Lizzy into bed?What is it with cowboys? Elizabeth's niece is about to marry one - unless she can stop the wedding. Now Elizabeth is falling in love with lean, handsome Jake. Even Pookie, her Shih Tzu, is romping madly with the ranch hands. There's no denying cowboys have their appeal. But could a wild man like Jake be roped and tamed by one determined city woman?[1st in the Boots & Beauties series]"
3,My Sentimental Heart: 1946,"This album has a historical value; most of pieces are pre-war recordings with typical 1930's orchestration. His artistry flourished and became the most popular in mid-1950, when he disbanded his orchestra and decided to perform as a soloist. As an extremely talented popular pianist Mr. Cavallaro was famous of his ornate pianistics. All recordings presented on this album are mono and despite thorough remastering show their age. More of his 1950's albums sound quite contemporary and their release would be much appreciated."
3,Serious stuff,"The reason I liked this book so much is that it was incredibly realistic. Eating disorders are a major problem in today's society and this author tells the truth in a fiction novel. She has had some experience with eating disorders which is one of the main reasons this book is bound to have an impact on a lot of teenagers and people who read it. I would reccomend this book to anyone, no matter what age, gender, or race."
1,Don't bother.,"This book is HORRIBLY written. The book jumps around, as everyone else has said, and is just very poorly written--the characters are flat and boring, the dialog is not believable, etc. A INFINITELY better book for teens on this subject is ""When is Perfect, Perfect Enough?"" by Nancy Rue."
3,Realistic view of eating disorders,"I'm glad this book was written. I couldn't put it down, and it was really moving. It's obvious that someone who really understands eating disorders wrote this. My only complaint is that it could have been written better. The scenes are choppy, jumping from scene to scene - character to character - every 2-3 pages or so. The writing style just seemed kind of plain and boring to me too. And even though the accounts of the eating disorders seemed so very real, the characters didn't come to life at all. Still, I would recomend this book to anybody who has an eating disorder or even is just unhappy with their weight. I wish I'd had this book to read when I was 12."
1,insatiable: this customer is still unsated.,"The title of ""Insatiable"" drew me in immediately, but the painfully crude and rudimentary writing forced me to stop reading it less than halfway through.As as recovering anorexic/bulimic of almost 10 years, I usually devour books on the subject- but ""insatiable"" is just too unrefined to stomach (eh, no pun intended). The first chapter alone left me feeling as though someone just came and robbed me of 20 IQ points. I tried to give it a chance and read through a few more, but it just didn't hold my interest in any way- I was distracted by the terrible writing the entire time.Save your money and buy something else. ANYTHING else. This was the worst book that I've ever read."
4,"Great Book, But Some Pros and Cons to it.","Insatiable is about four teen girls who most likely will make you change the way you think about food and yourself. I don't like the way it talks about how most people should start being anorexic, bolemic, and have eating disorders. It makes you want to throw up when you read about some parts in the book. Phoebe, Jessica, Samantha, and Hannah are all anorexic, bolemic, and with eating disorders. Their shame, fear, and confusion they all use food or refuse it to feel safe and control their lives. When you read this book it will feel like their pain, fears, courage, and learn about the therapy that is open for them. If you have ever felt or feel so empty you will never be full, so unworthy that you will never be loved, then i do recommend this book to you. It is a really good book and i really liked it for the most part."
3,Could have been better.,"There are two songs that are not of decent quality.1. Midnight Clear2. Silent NightThere is a lot of distortion in both.I bought the CD from www.imaginethismusic.com and I cannot get in touch with them either by email or US mail and I am not into Facebook. Gusto remastered but I cannot find an address on them either.If either read this, please leave an address on this sight so I can get in touch. I would appreciate another recording from a different batch. Thanks. Frank Guttery"
2,Good service. Poor product.,"The service was prompt and efficient, but the content of the DVD is quite poor. It appears to be recycled and repackaged older footage from 1999. In the days of BBC quality of photography this leaves much to be desired. Also, what's with this old shirtless man walking around, talking and taking a shower naked? My interest is primarily the animals, not people talking and wasting time. So much more could be done with the life of lions themselves. Also, this outer box where it is packaged is such a waste as it cannot fit in any standard DVD library. It appears to be ""amateurish"". Sorry, although the price is good, I am disappointed."
2,stick with concertina,"The first single of this song features Tori on a black and white cover, looking seductive and flashing her wedding ring in the corner. It has the same two live songs as the ""concertina"" single (""famous blue raincoat"" & ""twinkle""). Unless you have to have the complete set of singles from this album, just stick with ""concertina"".""You don't need my voice girl you have your own"" -Bells For Her, Tori Amos"
2,B-sides are easier to find elsewhere,"The B-sides for this single are identical to those on the ""Concertina"" single which was a US release and is easier to find and more affordable.The live performances of ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" and ""Twinkle"" warrant this a definite purchase for Tori fans. ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" is a Leonard Cohen cover than cannot be found anywhere else."
3,More stickers please...,"I bought this as a gift for a friend's daughter. She told me that she had used up all the stickers within a matter of minutes. Not worth the money unless you buy extra stickers. She did enjoy it tremendously, though."
1,"Hello Kitty ""Let Down""","My daughter got this for Christmas and within an hour and a half had did everything she could with it. It would be a real cool activity ""if"" you could find the replacement sticker tape and lamination. Even the big office stores are unable to special order them.allysmom"
3,Fun Item,"My daughter bought this item with her b-day money. She loves it. Plays with it all the time. We have reorder replacement parts a couple of times all ready with the easy form that can with the item. I also got sticker computer paper and cut it down to size my self, and use that. We have Hello Kitty stickers everywhere!!! Great item for Hello Kitty lovers everywhere!"
2,It's only OK,My daughter got this for christmas. It isn't great. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It is difficult to figure out.
3,refill found,"[...]It appears that the kit includes more white cards, another sheet of Hello Kitty paper, a roll of clear tape and sticker tape. The rolls of tape are the same size that the sticker maker originally came with. [...]My 5 year old loves this toy. It does waste a lot of tape so to conserve materials, we just make all of the stickers and crank them through at one time. Some of the stickers crinkle a little but since this is a toy neither my daughter, her friends, nor myself are expecting professional results. I am disappointed two fold that the tape and sticker paper refill rolls appear to be the same miniscule amounts provided with the original toy along with the shipping being more expensive than the refill item itself. [...]If anyone has found a source that sells generic rolls of clear tape and sticker paper that fit this toy please post your findings."
1,My daughter got this toy for xmas and it has been a disapointment,this toy was bought for my daughter for xmas and has been disapointing as the instructions are too hard to work out as it is just a sheet of pictures that arent clear at all. If anybody knows how to work this a bit of advice would be great lol!! Thanks
1,HORRIBBLE,Don't buy this toy.We followed all the directions right but instead of stickers we got paper! Don't waste your money!
2,Not well designed,"My daughter purchased this with her own money. Looks very neat, but a sticker making machine from any scrapbook store functions much better. Rather than applying the adhesive to the back of the material being sent through the machine, a clear plastic layer is applied to the top, and stuck to another paper layer on the bottom. Thus one needs to ensure that there is a border left around the sticker created to keep the top layer adhered to the bottom layer. Very poorly designed. I have also not been able to locate any replacement materials, so the machine becomes useless in short order."
1,Can't find replacement parts.,"My daughter bought this toy with money she saved, used up all the parts in less than an hour, and we were disappointed to find NO information on how to get replacement pieces to keep making stickers. This is a major problem with this toy."
4,GREAT TOY FOR HELLOKITTY LOVERS!,"i bought this toy for my 10 year old daughter and she loved it!She kept playing with it.SHE MADE ALL THE HELLOKITTY STICKERS.i give this toy a 4 ,the only thing i wish is it came with more stickers!"
4,Hello Kitty Sticker Maker,"My daughter received this item for Christmas and in one day used up all of the tape and stickers. Had I known that there were no replacement parts available, I would not have bought it. I do NOT think that it is a good value for the price of $14.99 because she was only able to use it for one day!"
4,I have read this book 5 times from the public library.,"This book moved me immensely. As stated above, I read it 5 times from the public library and have recently decided I'd like to do so again. And, after this decision, decided it would behoove me to have it in my library.It takes a man of the world who is ""hit by religion"" on an adventurous/spiritual journey. His wife, an agnostic at least, cannot buy into the whole idea. Sounds trite and not ""of the times"" but has some really deep values and decision making aspects that are great. Every time I read it I feel better myself."
1,says nothing but the obvious,"1. Pathetic and wrong information.2. Just the last page talks about GSM/CDMA stuff, leaving the core (vary basic functionality). Interesting part is that there have been tonnes of references towards finding IMEI numbering which is not applicable in the case of CDMA based handsets. Even that has not been clarified. So if I did not know it, I would still be continuing using *#06# in CDMA handsets, Oh !!!4. There are no probabilities in Security, either that is high state or low, leaving absolutely no scope to go to tri-state mode.5. No mention of intented audiences: Frankly speaking for technical people, its totally dump.6. The author has used the word ""basically"" in every other sentence and overall usage has gone in thousands."
3,dvd/vcer player Remotely dissappointing,"the remote didn't seem to work properly. I have been unable to get to the "" menu"" screen.Therefore, I am unable to set the clock or do taping via the timer. I called the 800 # and that only proved to be a waste of time"
3,Wrong Remote,I received my vcr on time and in good condition. I did wait a few weeks to install it and when doing so found that the remote sent with it is for a DVD and VHS recorder. The VCR I bought is NOT a DVR recorder. I am at a loss. Is there any way to contact the Seller and obtain the correct remote. I tried installing a universal remote and it did not work.Please HELP!!!
4,DVD player,I am pleased to let you know that I am very satisfied with my DCD player. It was just what you said that it would be. It works very well and produces good results..
4,dvd/vcr,It works great and came to me fast. Thank you for the speedy shipment and good product.I wouls buy from this retailer again.
2,Short-lived,"Amazing, I am rating this player at this time because it is broken. It did't last a year. The last refurbished player lasted 7 years. I expected this one to be the sam, but it was short-lived."
2,VERY disappointed in this machine,"I bought one back in February and was really excited to have a VHS player again (as well as a DVD player that would play ALL Regions), unfortunately, the DVD player only works when it wants to, it'll keep saying ""disc error"" on brand new discs, or just suddenly stops in the middle of a show and will never play that particular disc ever again (which is really annoying when you're watching a TV Series box set). The VHS player stopped working completely in August. So, for six months being able to watch my VHS tapes again was nice, but the DVD side is a worthless piece of crap!furthermore, and other reviewers complained about this as well, the Remote... it's covered in buttons that I've never had a reason to use. The buttons are also very small making it very easy for you to press a different button when you're trying to pause or go to the menu or skip to the next scene (the ""skip"" buttons took some time to figure out where they were too)."
2,not what I expected,"we ordered this product spacifically to get a working vhs player. this was advertised as being in great condition, when we got it, the only part we were needing didn't work! i now have yet another dvd player, and still no working vhs player."
3,Not so bad...,"Just wanted to add my two cents, as this is the VCR/DVD player we use daily, playing movies for my two kids, and (sometimes) us adults. We purchased it at Wal-Mart for $60 (dude, how did you pay $90 for this?!?), and for over two years, no problem on either side. It may not be fancy, but not everyone has a ""one-star"" experience with this product. We like it!"
2,Very basic DVD player,"I bought this unit at Wal Mart. It's fine for renting and watching DVDs. I've had no problems with the VHS player as well.The reason I give it only 2 stars is because it claims to be able to play DVDs in most any format. That is incorrect. I burned some videos onto DVD-Rs and tried playing them in the player. It wouldn't recogize the format. I have read some other reviewers comments and have found that its inability to play other formats is fairly common.So, for $60 DVD player, I suppose it is okay. Just don't buy this unit expecting to play all of the formats that it claims to be able to play."
1,Broken VHS after 10 months,"I originally bought this because I didn't want 6 million wires behind my entertainment center. But it's not been reliable, and the VHS part broke only after 10 months. The DVD's still play, but I'm wondering when it's going to go..."
1,Not a good experience,"I purchased this vcr dvd combo thinking it would be nice to have. From the first day I got it, it has not worked properly. I put a vcr tape in and it keeps ejecting it, the vcr timer doesn t even work, and again every time I turn the unit on,it keeps ejecting the tape. I am going to contact the seller in the hopes that I can get my money back.I am very disappointed that they would sell a unit that is broken."
5,Excellent VCR-DVD Player,"Excellent VCR-DVD player. All functions work well, TV, VCR & DVD.Excellent VCR-DVD player. All functions work well, TV, VCR & DVD."
2,Not quite like advertised,"this was supposed to be new, It came with no instruction book and an after market controler all showing wear. When I set it up it hummed and buzzed with the DVD. I believe you must put some thin cardboard in the dvd compartment to keep the lazer from getting so jumbled around. It is running okay right now after I reajusted the DVD drawer and I am hoping we get some decent use from this before it goes down. I am keeping it just thought the seller should know and future customers."
1,"What the heck, man?","Yes, this was a factory refurbished player, but I didn't figure that the VCR portion would break in the first week! Now I have a very bulky DVD player only and I'm not a happy camper."
5,Good buy,"I had purchased this make refurnished VCR from another company two months ago and then needed another one. This one cost a little more but is in beautiful shape, had a manual with it and a newer hand control. I am totally satisfied. I had two TVs that needed VCRs and hence, the two purchases."
4,Magnavox MWD2205 DVD/VCR Review,Product is completely satisfactory in every respect. It was delivered in a timely manner. It was well packed without any evidence of damage. Price is fair and performance is very satisfactory.
5,A Great Addition to Your Cookbook Collection!,"When I spotted this book, I had to get it for my growing collection of Wiccan Cookbooks. (The others include Celtic Folklore Cooking, Goddess in the Kitchen, and A Kitchen Witch's Cookbook.) I am not the best of cooks, so I was pleased to discover that the instructions were easy to follow and the ingredients were in most cases attainable. The research appears thorough, and you really get the sense that the authors love to cook. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Mostly 2 story homes only,"Buyer beware this floor plan book mainly contains 2 story homes. If you are looking for a variety as I was, you need to locate another book."
3,Best price by a long shot; spotty on quality,"I can't say how effectively this product filters fuel, but it's been in for a couple of weeks without incident, and no news is usually good news. Installation proved tricky because the crush washers provided weren't thick enough to prevent massive leakage, so I had to reuse the old washers."
2,Only 2 Stones,"This kit did *not* contain 3 stones, as advertised. Only 2 stones (black and blue) were included in the package."
3,not for sharpening edges really,"As amazon.com shows the DMT diamonds files with the ""Burr Doctor"" I shought it implied they are to be used for it. It turns out is is half the size of thefiles. I called DMT and it turns out the ""Burr Doctor"" is not for the files(or vise versa). The files are used with a larger edge sharpener."
1,Not worth it,"Too small unless you are 12 years old and have little fingers. Did not fit most sharpener holders. Should be sold with the holder it is designed for, or at least indicate which one to buy."
5,The best impact wrench for heavy lags,"I'm a carpenter and I've been using this wrench for years now without a single problem. I like to predrill my holes with a size down from the lag I use. It has never failed to drive a lag or completely tighten a bolt, no matter how large or the material. The best thing about impact wrenches VS 1/2"" drill is how the torque is applied. With a 1/2"" drill you get your arm jerked out of the socket every time you drive a lag. With an impact there is no torque twist at the drill handle. You can stand at the top of a ladder, reach out and drive a lag with one arm and NO danger, just predrill that baby and you're good to go. This drill is bullet-proof."
2,345 ft. lbs? - Probably not,"I also purchased this electric impact wrench to avoid messing around with a compressor and pneumatic wrench. I have separate sets of summer and winter tires each mounted on their own rims. I always use a torque wrench when replacing wheels for the season, or detailed cleaning, etc. The only time they are possibly not properly torqued is at State inspection time - 1x/year in PA.The DeWalt tool has never been able to break the wheel nuts loose after a few days of the nuts being properly torqued. The nuts are steel and the wheels aluminum, and maybe some galvanic corrosion is taking place. But it's hard to believe that it takes more than the rated 345 ft-lbs to loosen the nuts. I use an 18"" breaker bar to overcome the initial loosening, then use the DeWalt wrench. It does make the job faster in that respect; eliminating the spinning by hand. At least I get some use out of the tool, but it's disappointing that it won't work fully as intended."
1,The first Dewalt product that I haven't been satisfied with - not very strong,"I am a weekend mechanic who values his time and tools. I am a firm believer in using the right tool for the correct job. I purchased this impact wrench that supposedly has 345 ft'/lbs of torque. I was using it to remove the wheels on my car that I torque to 90 ft/lbs with a torque wrench. This impact wrench was not powerful enough to remove any of the 20 lug nuts that i needed to remove. I tried each and every one of them, but ultimately had to use a breaker bar to loosen them all.The tried and tried and wanted to keep this tool, but ultimately returned it and am reverting back to using my air tools...or I may consider purchasing the Milwaukee equivalent. That seems to get better reviews at a slightly higher price. I don't recommend purchasing this product other than to unscrew lug nuts that are already loosened. Good luck!"
5,great,well this was a great price and my best buyeverything was fine when box came shipped to me in two days wow that was great will be back to buy more from this person
5,I liked it better than Country Falls....,"... which was a great LP, but I thought it was carried on the strength of only a few great tracks (Summertime Cowboy and City Nights). I agree with the other 5*'s that this CD has a more consistent, coherent sound--though I can see why Kort Kramer might prefer CF. Hard to go wrong with Husky Rescue. Unlike most here, I actually like the more ""folk"" tracks best; my favorite is Hurricane though, again, that's just me. Nightless night is great too."
3,"Pleasant, but falls short","I am a big fan of Country Falls and was looking forward to this release.Now that I have it, I am sadly a bit disappointed.Sure, it has their trademark sound which is always nice, but as an album it feels a bit lacking.Maybe with repeat listens it will grow on me, but after several listens, the only standouts are tracks 4-6, Blueberry Tree Parts I-III -- and that could have been made into one long song. It is a love set of songs, but not enough to carry an entire album. At a mere 42:29 minutes in length, it would have made a good EP, but as a full album, it doesn't quite cut it. The other tracks are nice, but nothing memorable like countless tracks from Country Falls.I am still a fan, but hope for better come album #3.Great album design btw, though the disc is in a slipcase and not a tray.EDIT: Weeks later, the album has indeed grown on me as have some of the other songs, but I have to say that is it still not quite as enjoyable as their previous album."
4,scuffletown by eric taylor,"eric taylor has a hypnotic singing and guitar style. especially on the incredible song, Happy Ending. He tends to drop the last word on certain lines, but this forces you to read the words. great effort that should propel him out of Texas."
5,Fantastic Collection of Classic Games; Great Retro Illustrations,"My daughter received these as a gift for Christmas and the whole family just loves them! The illustrations are retro, and really cool. I didn't grow up with these - I was a child of the late 70's - but I wish I had. They're a pleasure to gaze upon as you await your next turn :)My daughter was instantly able to play Animal Rummy as it is so similar to Go Fish, and such an easy game to master. Old Maid doesn't require a lot of skill, though Crazy Eights and Hearts are a little advanced for her yet.Nonetheless, I think this set is a fantastic must-have set of games to have around. We enjoy collecting games. I loved them as a child, and hope to share that love with my children. I'm so thrilled to have this set in our collection.For anyone who's interested, they are manufactured in China."
2,"Did anyone else notice the ""Lady Midget"" and ""Gay Dog"" cards?","The cards are advertised as from the 1950's and 60's. They are absolutely correct. The ""Old Maid"" deck contains ""Lady Midget"" and ""Man Midget"", ""Bareback Rider"", and ""Fat Lady"". Animal Rummy has ""Gay Dog"".""Lady & Man Midget"", ""Fat Lady"" and ""Gay Dog"" really need to be updated. I doubt kids (maybe even some adults) will know the alternative meaning of riding bareback.I get that these cards based on the 1950s, but, I can't recommend them. I'm going to recommend my brother takes those cards out of the deck.Awkward Chrismas present."
5,Great~,This card set is fantastic!! It has the exact same pictures on each deck from the deck of cards I used to play as a child with my grandmother. It's been so much fun sharing these games with my own son.
2,Think Fun 4 children's card games,The cards were not the quality of the '60's. Quality of the paper used much thinner and bend easily. Color of the cards was good.
3,"Illustrations are just OK, and cards aren't great quality","Based on the numerous 5 star reviews, I guess I was expecting a little more. The illustrations are simple and colorful, but nothing special. Also the cards are small, not well laminated, and of mediocre quality. I'd think you could get a set of these cards at the dollar store, and so I'm not sure about the price for these four games. Overall, I was underwhelmed."
4,very good,"I have not seen this video, however I do remember when this was on television. I thought it was very good, a modern twist to the original Dark Shadows, but very creepy and mysterious. Just when it was starting to get good, they took it off the air. I think they should bring this series back for those original Dark Shadows fans. We don't all have to watch the same ""reality TV"" [stuff] on tv all the time."
5,Fun little take-along toy,"We have this and the animals mini-puzzle pack. There are four puzzles, with four pieces each. We keep one at home for playing with, and the other in the diaper bag to pull out at friends houses or restaurants for entertainment. The pieces are small (it is a mini-puzzle pack), but not choking hazard size for a small child I don't think. My son is two, and has had these for about a year now. We've progressed from the fun of dumping them out, to putting them back, to naming them as we put them back. They are a bit much to keep track of if they start getting thrown in a restaurant, but in general are good entertainment. They've stood up pretty well - they made it through the end of his put-everything-in-the-mouth phase, and some of the pieces are only a little worse for the wear for having a dog chew on them."
1,"very bad packaging, discs dislodged and scratched","This review is only on the packaging. The packaging looks very nice, it is a 10"" size red velvet box, a bit smaller than a LP. The big problem is that inside the CDs are placed next to each other (two in the top, two in the bottom). As a result, the chances that they get dislodged during transport are high: I got two copies of it and in both cases, all four CDs were dislodged and consequently scratched.The difference between this edition and the non-limited edition (ASIN: B000F5GKP4) is the fourth disc with unmixed songs. If this is the reason you plan on buying this edition, you can find most of the songs in their unmixed full length versions either on the GU 10 (unmixed) version (ASIN: B000GPI3BC) or on the artists' albums.I do not recommend this item, the rating of 1 star is based on the state in which it is unfortunately likely to be received, that is, damaged."
2,Dorky Dirk,"Was expecting leather, not platic meant to look like braided leather. Could do without that gaudy plastic red bauble too. Inexpensive, you get what you pay for. Save your money and get something at the faire, so at least you know what you're getting. Tang not seated well."
2,Toblerone white,"One chocolate is missing, I ordered for a dozen & my son was surprised to get only 11 chocolate bars."
2,Hersheys white chocolate tastes better than this...,"I thought these would taste better but the extra ingredients like the honey and almonds makes it taste strange. Also, the chocolate contains lots of sugar so don't eat the whole thing at once."
3,Uh-Oh Oatmeal Raisinette,"This is a beautiful cookbook and my daughter loves it. However, when I let my two kids bake alone for the first time they made a bad choice. The Oatmeal Raisinette Cookies recipe calls for 2 and 1/2 sticks of butter and only 1 egg, 1 and 1/2 cups of flour, and 3/4 cup of oatmeal. My kids were obviously not experienced enough to realize that the amount of butter is way out of proportion, so their ""cookies"" melted all over the oven. Needless to say, I'm disappointed that the book wasn't more carefully edited. I won't let them use this book again unless I examine the recipe carefully first myself."
2,"Fun photos, but I wouldn't recommend","I'm always surprised at how many people I know have this book. We were given this book as a present, but I wouldn't recommend it. With that said, it does have some positive aspects. I like the intro that simplifies keeping a kosher kitchen. The photos are also fun and colorful and my kids (ages 3 & 5) love to look through this book and it does get them excited about cooking. My biggest complaint about this book is that the recipes are so unhealthy! I wouldn't want my kids eating or cooking with most of the ingredients. Having fun with your kids in the kitchen is a great way to teach them about nutrition with out them knowing it, and this book totally misses this point. For example, she has you cooking with hot dogs and jars baby food! If that doesn't bother you, you may like this book. If you care about your child's health and want to have fun with your kids in the kitchen I recommend Julie Negrin's or Mollie Katzen's books."
4,pretty good!,"I am pretty pleased with this cook book, and definitely would reccomend it to others. It says it's for kids,but it feels like it's more for kids 10-13, and not little kids. Enjoy!!"
3,too expensive,"howdy y'all,the actual product is VERY good - i'd rate the item a 4 on it's own. however, it's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.as i said, TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.take care,lee"
2,Cute but very small,I got this house for my three year old and its not very easy to get those little hands in there and play. But my daughter still loves it. Its a cute house but a little hard to get the little hands in there.
